1
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:28,396
Here it is!

2
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:30,929
Thanks.

3
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:36,438
Did you guys sign it?

4
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:48,852
Did you sign the card?

5
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,033
And five and four and...

6
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,968
Hey, girls, sign!

7
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:09,839
All right! Here you go!

8
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:18,679
-Elle's gonna love it! -Thanks.

9
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,219
You go, girl!

10
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:49,272
Hi, girls! Here, sign!

11
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:53,710
Thanks!

12
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,158
There she is.

13
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,022
Thank you.

14
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,534
l love that restaurant!

15
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,332
l heard Madonna went into labor there.

16
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,134
Oh, gosh! l have to go shopping!

17
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,039
l'll see you tonight. Bye.

18
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:18,275
Bruiser, what's this?

19
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:25,651
Good luck tonight. Elle and Warner forever.

20
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,585
Oh,that's so cute.

21
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:46,103
Oh, my gosh! You guys are so sweet!

22
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:49,270
But l'm not positive it'll happen tonight.

23
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,810
Hello! He just had lunch with his grandmother.

24
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,141
You know he got the rock.

25
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,340
Why else would she have flown in from Newport?

26
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,918
it's not like she'd Fed Ex a six-carat diamond.

27
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:58,986
Do you really think?

28
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,849
l can't believe you're getting engaged!

29
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:03,655
Oh, my gosh...

30
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,816
you guys have to help me pick out the perfect outfit.

31
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:07,288
Come on!

32
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:09,962
l think you should go with the red.

33
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:11,531
it's the color of confidence.

34
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,759
l don't understand why you're disregarding...

35
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:15,062
your signature color.

36
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,263
He's proposing. l can't look like l would on any other date.

37
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:21,570
This is the date... the night l'll always remember.

38
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:23,737
l want to look special.

39
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:26,173
Bridal.

40
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,907
But not like l expect anything.

41
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,209
There's nothing l love more...

42
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,409
than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic.

43
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:35,416
Did you see this one? We just got it in yesterday.

44
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:39,017
ls this low-viscosity rayon?

45
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,258
Yes. Of course.

46
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,394
With a half-loop top-stitching on the hem?

47
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:45,625
Absolutely. it's one of a kind.

48
00:04:47,435 --> 00:04:50,165
it's impossible to use a half-loop top-stitching...

49
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,637
on low-viscosity rayon. lt would snag the fabric.

50
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,604
And you didn't just get it in.

51
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:56,505
l saw it in the June Vogue a year ago.

52
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:58,636
So if you're trying to sell it for full price...

53
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:00,212
you picked the wrong girl.

54
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:07,645
Girls, this is it.

55
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:10,183
in a few hours...

56
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,919
l'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington lll.

57
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:48,360
Wow. You look so beautiful.

58
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:50,225
So do you.

59
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:01,767
Let's get out of here.

60
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,826
Must be strange having such perfect eyes.

61
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:26,092
God, you're so wonderful. Elle,thank you.

62
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:31,003
Here's to us.

63
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,736
To us.

64
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:45,215
One of the reasons l wanted to come here tonight...

65
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:47,048
was to discuss our future.

66
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,380
And l am fully amenable to that discussion.

67
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:53,156
Good. You know how we've been having...

68
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:54,522
all kinds of fun lately?

69
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:57,592
Well, Harvard is gonna be different.

70
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,867
Law school is a completely different world...

71
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:02,731
and l need to be serious.

72
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,031
Of course.

73
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,270
My family expects a lot from me.

74
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:09,238
-Right. -l expect a lot from me.

75
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:12,244
l plan on running for office someday.

76
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,712
l fully support that. You know that.

77
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,806
Absolutely. But the thing is...

78
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:19,645
if l'm going to be a senator by the time l'm thirty...

79
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:22,088
l need to stop dicking around.

80
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:25,925
Warner, l completely agree.

81
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,156
That's why l think it's time for us...

82
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,297
Elle, pooh bear...

83
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:38,803
-l do. -l think we should break up.

84
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:44,176
What?

85
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,837
l've been thinking, and it's the right thing to do.

86
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:48,871
You're breaking up with me?

87
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:52,045
l thought you were proposing.

88
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:53,552
Proposing?

89
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,885
Elle, if l'm going to be a senator...

90
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:59,859
l need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.

91
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:04,458
You're breaking up with me because l'm too blonde?

92
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:06,858
No. That's not entirely true.

93
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,468
Then what? My boobs are too big?

94
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:13,199
Elle, your boobs are fine.

95
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:14,865
So when you said that you would always love me...

96
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,500
you were just dicking around?

97
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:18,536
Elle, l do love you.

98
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,509
l just can't marry you.

99
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,474
You have no idea of the pressure that l am under.

100
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:26,984
My family has five generations of senators.

101
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,155
My brother's in the top three at Yale Law.

102
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:32,153
He just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake.

103
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,600
Bad salad.

104
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,299
Sweetie...

105
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,472
Pooh bear?

106
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,510
it's not like l have a choice here, sweetheart!

107
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:00,283
You get the car, l'll get the check.

108
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:02,044
l won't be having the salad.

109
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,688
Let me take you home.

110
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,530
Elle, believe me. l never expected to do this...

111
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,961
but l think it's the right thing.

112
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:20,738
How can it be the right thing when we're not together?

113
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:23,338
l have to think of my future...

114
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:25,173
and what my family expects of me.

115
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:27,074
So you're breaking up with me...

116
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,012
because you're afraid your family won't like me?

117
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,917
Everybody likes me.

118
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,116
East Coast people are different.

119
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:36,285
Because l'm not a Vanderbilt, suddenly l'm white trash?

120
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,857
l grew up in Bel Air!

121
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,482
Across the street from Aaron Spelling!

122
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,527
Most people would agree that's a lot better...

123
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,324
than some stinky old Vanderbilt!

124
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:46,831
l told you. l need someone serious.

125
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,270
But l'm seriously in love with you.

126
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:55,631
lsn't that enough?

127
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,710
Pooh bear, just get in the car.

128
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:05,849
You'll ruin your shoes.

129
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:03,567
Morning, Amy.

130
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:11,115
Elle, it's Amy.

131
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:13,584
l'm having trouble with this whole lip-liner thing.

132
00:11:13,988 --> 00:11:16,650
-Sweetie, didn't you hear? -Hear what?

133
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,215
it's terrible. He dumped her.

134
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:21,954
Why me?

135
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:25,698
Because you're not gonna remember anything after tonight.

136
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:29,967
Oh,you're wrong.

137
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:33,736
l will remember, no matter what.

138
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,501
And l'm never gonna lose you again.

139
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,839
You couldn't.

140
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:42,780
You're a part of me.

141
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,717
l love you.

142
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:47,882
Liar!

143
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:51,017
Honey, you have to leave this room.

144
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:52,716
it's been, like, a week.

145
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:55,652
-So? -Drink this.

146
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:58,795
What always makes us feel better...

147
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,196
no matter what?

148
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:07,000
She had eight grilled cheese sandwiches.

149
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,672
She stuffed them in her mouth all at once.

150
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:10,903
lt was so sad.

151
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,639
We thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle...

152
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:15,611
and now she's totally adrift.

153
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,213
Totally.

154
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,151
She hasn't conditioned her hair in a week.

155
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,322
Maybe she's going for the grunge look.

156
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,754
And her nails are full-on chipped.

157
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,393
So trailer park.

158
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:41,941
Oh, my God! Do you know who this is?

159
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:45,205
-That's Warner's older brother! -Who?

160
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:49,348
Third year Yale Law student Putnam Bowes Huntington lll...

161
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:52,145
and his fiancee Layne Walker Vanderbilt...

162
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:55,822
first year Yale Law.

163
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,857
This is the type of girl that Warner wants to marry!

164
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:03,463
This is what l need to become to be serious!

165
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:06,165
What? Practically deformed?

166
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:10,164
No. A law student.

167
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:18,738
Law school?

168
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,280
it's a perfectly respectable place, daddy.

169
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:24,312
Honey, you were first runner up...

170
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,476
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest.

171
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:28,680
Why are you gonna throw that all away?

172
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:30,489
Going to Harvard is the only way...

173
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:32,081
l'll get the love of my life back.

174
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:34,556
Sweetheart, you don't need law school.

175
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:36,162
Law school is for people...

176
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:39,790
who are boring and ugly and serious.

177
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:42,602
And you, Button, are none of those things.

178
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,866
Harvard Law School?

179
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:50,771
That's right.

180
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,937
But that's a top three school.

181
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,805
Oh, l have a 4.0.

182
00:13:56,617 --> 00:14:00,018
Yes, but your major is fashion merchandising.

183
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:05,518
Harvard won't be impressed that you aced History of Polka Dots.

184
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:11,392
What are your back-ups?

185
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:13,864
l don't need back-ups. l'm going to Harvard.

186
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,404
Well,then,you'll need...

187
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:20,163
excellent recommendations from your professors.

188
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:23,902
And a heck of an admissions essay.

189
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,369
Right.

190
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:30,141
And at least a 1 75 on your LSATs.

191
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:33,486
l once had to judge a tighty-whitey contest...

192
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:34,713
for Lambda Kappa Pi.

193
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,879
Trust me, l can handle anything.

194
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:44,022
Thanks!

195
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:46,458
You're welcome.

196
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:50,534
Because l have a metrabolism...

197
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,400
-l have a really high metrab... -it's metabol...

198
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,542
Oh, my God.

199
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,370
What are you doing?

200
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:04,276
Reading about the LSATs.

201
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:06,678
My cousin had that.

202
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,787
Apparently, you get a really bad rash on your...

203
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:13,191
The LSATs are an exam.

204
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,385
Girls, l'm going to Harvard!

205
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:17,857
-You mean like on vay-kay? -Let's all go!

206
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:19,391
Road trip!

207
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,529
No. l'm going to Harvard Law School.

208
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,272
Why?

209
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:31,273
Elle, now, l know you're upset about all this...

210
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,039
but can't you just take a Percoset?

211
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:37,681
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student...

212
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:39,312
he'll totally want me back.

213
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,944
it's a completely brilliant plan!

214
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:44,253
But isn't it hard to get into law school?

215
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,617
l had the highest GPA in Delta Nu.

216
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:52,596
Oh,well. Here, you're gonna need this.

217
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:54,860
Your scrunchy?

218
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:58,560
My lucky scrunchy. it helped me pass Spanish.

219
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,707
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya...

220
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,572
a lap dance after the final.

221
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:06,369
Yeah...luckily.

222
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:19,521
My name is Elle Woods, and for my admissions essay...

223
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:21,558
l'm gonna tell all of you at Harvard...

224
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:24,528
why l'm gonna make an amazing lawyer.

225
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,897
As president of my sorority...

226
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,195
l'm skilled at commanding the attention of a room...

227
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:31,133
and discussing very important issues.

228
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:33,502
it has come to my attention that the maintenance staff...

229
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,041
is switching our toilet paper from Charmin...

230
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,377
to generic.

231
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,704
All those opposed to chafing please say aye.

232
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:44,980
A...neither type of opera...

233
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,814
or neither type of rap is on sale.

234
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:48,581
B...neither type of jazz...

235
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:50,486
and neither type of opera is on sale.

236
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:53,559
C...neither type of opera and neither type of soul...

237
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,522
Party! Delta Nu,we love you!

238
00:17:03,036 --> 00:17:06,870
l'm able to recall hundreds of important details...

239
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:08,304
at the drop of a hat.

240
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:09,466
Hey, Elle, do you know what happened...

241
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,043
on Days of Our Lives yesterday?

242
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:12,702
Why, yes, Margot, l do.

243
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:15,577
Once again, we join Hope in the search for her identity.

244
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,617
As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano.

245
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:22,888
Get set and go!

246
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,961
One forty-three.

247
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:42,475
l feel comfortable using legal jargon in everyday life.

248
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:45,739
l object!

249
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,222
it's here!

250
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,692
-What? -it's here!

251
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:06,722
The LSAT scores! it's here!

252
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:08,892
Open the scores!

253
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:10,397
What's the score?

254
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:13,596
-This is so exciting. -Tell us!

255
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,770
What is it?

256
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:21,478
One seventy-nine!

257
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:31,888
One seventy-nine!

258
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:43,497
And that's why you should vote for me...

259
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,572
Elle Woods, future lawyer for the class of 2004.

260
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:57,480
She does have a 4.0 from CULA...

261
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:00,084
and she got a 1 79 on her LSATs.

262
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,252
A fashion major?

263
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,981
Well, sir, we've never had one before...

264
00:19:05,158 --> 00:19:06,989
and aren't we always looking for diversity?

265
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:10,186
Her list of extracurricular activities is impressive.

266
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,599
She was in a Ricky Martin video.

267
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,530
Clearly, she's interested in music.

268
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:20,372
She also designed a line of fauxfur panties...

269
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:22,642
for her sorority's charity project.

270
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:26,406
She's a friend to the animals as well as a philanthropist.

271
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,346
Elle Woods...

272
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:33,480
welcome to Harvard.

273
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:38,578
Bruiser, it's so exciting! Look! Harvard!

274
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:40,713
Are you excited?

275
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:54,057
This is our new house for the next three years.

276
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:55,667
Are you thirsty?

277
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,696
Let's get you some water.

278
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,666
Sweetheart, you just look parched.

279
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,340
Hey, Brad, check out Malibu Barbie!

280
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,077
Where's the beach, honey?

281
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:08,974
Here you go.

282
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:12,148
Good boy. Warner's gonna be so excited to see you.

283
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,480
Guys, this way.

284
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,786
-This ain't L.A.! -Come on, Bruiser.

285
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,721
Check her out. Look at the way she walks.

286
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,153
it's gonna be so exciting.

287
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:25,925
Now, don't be scared. Everyone will love you.

288
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:33,296
Hi. Woods, comma, Elle.

289
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:40,341
Class schedule, map, book list.

290
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:47,686
Wait a second. My social events calendar is missing.

291
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:49,744
Your what?

292
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:52,222
Social events... you know, mixers, formals...

293
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,491
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

294
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:01,823
Has Warner Huntington lll checked in yet?

295
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:07,363
Maybe you should check with the cruise director...

296
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,599
on the Lido deck.

297
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:13,603
Welcome to law school.

298
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:16,508
This is the part where we go around in a circle...

299
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:19,617
and everyone says a little bit about themselves.

300
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:21,916
Let's start with you.

301
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,120
My name is David Kidney.

302
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:27,058
l have a masters in Russian literature...

303
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:30,289
a PhD in biochemistry...

304
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:32,259
and for the last eighteen months...

305
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:35,391
l've been deworming orphans in Somalia.

306
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,569
Awesome. What about you?

307
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:41,841
Hey. How you doing'? l'm Enid Wexler.

308
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:43,739
l got a Ph.D. from Berkeley in women's studies...

309
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,571
emphasis in the history of combat...

310
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:48,747
and last year, l single-handedly organized...

311
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:51,146
the march for Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.

312
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:53,477
-Killer. -Thanks. Good times.

313
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:55,949
Aaron Mitchell.

314
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:58,024
l graduated first in my class from Princeton.

315
00:22:58,124 --> 00:22:59,648
l have an l.Q. of 1 87...

316
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:02,688
and it's been suggested that Stephen Hawking...

317
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:04,660
stole his Brief History of Time...

318
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:07,665
from my fourth grade paper.

319
00:23:08,368 --> 00:23:09,357
Cool.

320
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:11,829
-Me? -Yeah.

321
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,607
Hi. l'm Elle Woods and this is Bruiser Woods...

322
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,175
and we're both Gemini vegetarians.

323
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:22,210
l have a bachelor's degree in fashion merchandising...

324
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:25,512
from CULA, and l was a Zeta Lambda Nu sweetheart...

325
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,984
president of my sorority, Delta Nu...

326
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:30,283
and last year, l was homecoming queen.

327
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,452
Two weeks ago l saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal...

328
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:36,721
and l talked her out of buying...

329
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,922
this truly heinous angora sweater.

330
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:40,556
Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.

331
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:47,735
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

332
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:50,207
This is my first class as a serious law student.

333
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,774
l totally look the part.

334
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,756
There is no way she got in here on her own.

335
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:37,619
l totally forgot you go here.

336
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:39,518
What are you talking about?

337
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:42,627
l'm sorry. Are you here to see me?

338
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,990
No, silly. l go here.

339
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:46,955
You go where?

340
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:49,466
Harvard. Law school.

341
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:52,731
You got into Harvard Law?

342
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,937
What, like it's hard?

343
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:57,066
Oh, my gosh, Warner, it'll be so great.

344
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:59,472
l'm planning this great mixer. You have to help me.

345
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:02,375
l'm thinking like a luau or casino night.

346
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:04,977
it'll be just like senior year except funner.

347
00:25:09,155 --> 00:25:10,281
Time to go. l have to go to class...

348
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,051
but meet me after on the benches.

349
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:13,593
All right, bye!

350
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:33,935
A legal education means you will learn...

351
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:36,379
to speak in a new language.

352
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:40,145
You will be taught to achieve insight...

353
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:42,118
into the world around you...

354
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:46,823
and to sharply question what you know.

355
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:51,922
The seat you have picked will be yours...

356
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:54,966
for the next nine months of your life.

357
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:58,195
And those of you in the front row...

358
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:01,432
beware.

359
00:26:03,943 --> 00:26:07,572
The law is reason free from passion.

360
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:11,010
Does anyone know who spoke those immortal words?

361
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,245
-Yes? -Aristotle.

362
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:23,759
Are you sure?

363
00:26:24,197 --> 00:26:28,156
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?

364
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:31,701
l think so.

365
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:37,836
What about his life?

366
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,246
l don't know.

367
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:48,853
Well, l recommend knowing before speaking.

368
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:53,849
The law leaves much room for interpretation...

369
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:57,192
but very little for self-doubt.

370
00:26:58,932 --> 00:27:00,365
And you were right.

371
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:03,602
lt was Aristotle.

372
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,432
Good job.

373
00:27:06,306 --> 00:27:10,037
Now, l assume all of you have read pages 1-48...

374
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:12,907
and are now well-versed in subject matter jurisdiction.

375
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:17,112
Who can tell us about Gordon vs. Steele?

376
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:19,774
Let's call on someone from the hot zone.

377
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:39,194
Elle Woods?

378
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,875
Actually, l wasn't aware that we had an assignment.

379
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:01,353
Vivian Kensington.

380
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:04,730
Do you think it's acceptable that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

381
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:11,301
l don't.

382
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:16,175
Would you support my decision to ask her to leave class...

383
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:19,071
and to return only when she is prepared?

384
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,269
Absolutely.

385
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,665
Now, Ms. Kensington...

386
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:44,599
did diversity jurisdiction exist in this case?

387
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:46,935
No, it did not.

388
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:51,476
Good. How about in the case of Owens vs. McCullough?

389
00:29:01,955 --> 00:29:03,183
l can't believe that girl.

390
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:04,620
So stupid!

391
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:05,816
Who does she think she is?

392
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:07,619
Excuse me. Are you OK?

393
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,297
Do they put you on the spot like that all the time?

394
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,998
The professors?

395
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,592
They tend to do that. Socratic method.

396
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:21,568
lf you don't know the answers, they just kick you out?

397
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:24,075
You have Strom well, huh?

398
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,608
Yes! Did she do that to you, too?

399
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:28,738
No. But she did make me cry once.

400
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,009
Not in class. l waited till l got back to my room...

401
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,674
but she'll kick you right in the ball...

402
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:35,020
Or wherever,you know.

403
00:29:35,154 --> 00:29:36,519
She's really tough.

404
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:39,486
Great.

405
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:41,583
Don't worry, it gets better. Who else do you have?

406
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:46,025
l have Callahan, Royalton, and Levinthal.

407
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,398
Let's see, speak up in Callahan's class.

408
00:29:49,502 --> 00:29:51,402
He really likes people that are opinionated.

409
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:54,072
And in Royalton's class...

410
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:57,333
try to get a seat in the back.

411
00:29:57,443 --> 00:30:00,276
He spits when he talks about products liability.

412
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,582
And for Levinthal, make sure you read the footnotes.

413
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:06,914
That's where he gets a lot of his exam questions.

414
00:30:07,854 --> 00:30:09,082
Right.

415
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,720
Wow. l'm really glad l met you.

416
00:30:17,497 --> 00:30:18,930
Are you a third year?

417
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,696
-Well... -Hey, Elle.

418
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:23,666
Hi! Thanks for all your help.

419
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,866
Good luck.

420
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,008
So...

421
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,510
how was your first class?

422
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:37,147
lt was good, except for this horrible preppy girl...

423
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,945
who made me look bad in front of the professor.

424
00:30:39,352 --> 00:30:40,444
But no biggie.

425
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,947
You're here now. So, how was your summer?

426
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,287
Good. lt was good.

427
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:46,585
Did you do anything exciting?

428
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:53,626
Have you met Vivian?

429
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:57,335
Hi. Vivian Kensington.

430
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:01,134
Do you know her?

431
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:04,172
-She's... -l'm his fiancee.

432
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:14,844
l'm sorry. l just hallucinated. What?

433
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,191
She was my girlfriend in prep school.

434
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:22,691
And,well,we got back together this summer...

435
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:24,887
at my grandmother's birthday party.

436
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:27,722
Warner told me all about you.

437
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:30,565
You're famous at our club.

438
00:31:31,604 --> 00:31:33,128
But he didn't tell me you'd be here.

439
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:36,365
Pooh bear, l didn't know she would be here.

440
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,640
Excuse me.

441
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,290
Oh,thank God!

442
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,616
Are you free? it's an emergency.

443
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:21,345
Bad day?

444
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:23,855
You can't even imagine.

445
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:28,425
Spill.

446
00:32:29,195 --> 00:32:31,060
l worked so hard to get into law school.

447
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:34,458
l blew off Greek week to study for the LSATs.

448
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,068
l even hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video.

449
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,237
All to get my boyfriend Warner back.

450
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,806
And now he's engaged to this awful girl Vivian...

451
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:43,599
so it was all for nothing, and l...

452
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:45,137
l just wish...

453
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:49,140
l just wish l had never gone to Harvard.

454
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,210
After you went to all that trouble.

455
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:53,950
He's engaged!

456
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,312
She's got the six-carat Harry Winston...

457
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:58,390
on her bony, unpolished finger.

458
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,626
What am l supposed to do?

459
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:05,963
You're asking the wrong girl.

460
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:08,667
l mean, l'm with my guy eight years...

461
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,095
and then one day, it's...

462
00:33:10,736 --> 00:33:12,761
l met someone else. Move out.

463
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:16,606
Oh, no. That's awful.

464
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:20,271
Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus.

465
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:26,111
l didn't even get to throw him a birthday party.

466
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:29,347
What's a girl to do?

467
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,620
He's a guy who followed his pecker...

468
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:34,022
to greener pastures...

469
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:37,128
and l'm a middle-aged high-school dropout...

470
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:40,231
who's got stretch marks and a fat ass.

471
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,429
That's terrible.

472
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,096
Yep. Happens every day.

473
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:50,173
So what's this Vivian got that you don't have?

474
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,670
Three tits?

475
00:33:52,044 --> 00:33:54,012
She's from Connecticut.

476
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:55,740
She belongs to his stupid country club.

477
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:57,816
ls she as pretty as you?

478
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:01,979
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights...

479
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:05,386
but she's not completely unfortunate looking.

480
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:09,256
Hello, ladies.

481
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:11,152
-Hey,there. -How you doing? Sign here.

482
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,731
Oh,jeez.

483
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,435
Look what l did.

484
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,768
-See you later. -Bye-bye, sugar.

485
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:28,173
Aw, shit.

486
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:31,239
Could l have been any more goddamn spastic?

487
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:33,176
it's OK.

488
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,212
Are you sure this Warner guy is, like, the one?

489
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:40,656
Definitely. l love him.

490
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:47,627
Well, if a girl like you can't hold on to her man...

491
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:50,960
then there sure as hell isn't any hope for the rest of us.

492
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,336
What are you waiting for?

493
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:58,535
Steal the bastard back.

494
00:35:03,382 --> 00:35:04,280
l should warn you...

495
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:05,350
l should warn you...

496
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:06,748
that in addition to competing against each other...

497
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:08,410
for the top grade in this class...

498
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:11,452
you will also be competing for one of my firm's...

499
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:15,186
highly coveted four internship spots next year...

500
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:18,520
where you will get to assist on actual cases.

501
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,794
Let he bloodbath begin.

502
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:25,967
Now, let's commence with our usual torture.

503
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:29,598
Ms. Woods...

504
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:32,937
would you rather have a client who committed a crime...

505
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:36,047
malum in se or malum prohibitum?

506
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,109
Neither.

507
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:43,448
And why is that?

508
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:46,391
l would rather have a client who's innocent.

509
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:51,160
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

510
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:56,928
Ms. Kensington, which would you prefer?

511
00:35:58,404 --> 00:35:59,894
Malum prohibitum.

512
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:03,304
Because then the client would have committed...

513
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:06,901
a regulatory infraction as opposed to a dangerous crime.

514
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,138
Well done, Ms. Kensington.

515
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,774
You've obviously done your homework.

516
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:15,184
Now let us look at malum prohibitum...

517
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:16,788
a little more closely.

518
00:36:17,223 --> 00:36:19,487
it has been said... Yes, Ms. Woods?

519
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,989
l changed my mind. l'd pick the dangerous one...

520
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,055
'cause l'm not afraid of a challenge.

521
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:41,502
Who is that?

522
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:45,615
Wow.

523
00:36:48,054 --> 00:36:49,078
Guys.

524
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,151
-Can she play? -Hi!

525
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:57,329
Get outta here.

526
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:07,268
-Hi, everybody. -Elle, what are you doing here?

527
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:08,972
l've come to join your study group.

528
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,176
Look, l brought sustenance. Who's first?

529
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,441
Our group is full.

530
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:17,911
ls this like an RSVP thing?

531
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:19,951
No. it's like a smart people thing.

532
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,845
And as Viv said, we're full.

533
00:37:22,955 --> 00:37:24,820
Come on, we can make room for one more.

534
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:28,052
We've already assigned the outlines.

535
00:37:30,062 --> 00:37:31,256
The answer is no.

536
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,532
Oh, OK. l'll just leave, then.

537
00:37:50,883 --> 00:37:52,976
Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority...

538
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,643
you could, like, join instead, like?

539
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:57,016
lf you had come to a rush party...

540
00:37:57,123 --> 00:37:58,647
l would have at least been nice to you.

541
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,918
ls that before you voted against me...

542
00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:02,789
and then called me a dyke behind my back?

543
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:04,657
l don't use that word.

544
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:07,522
You must have heard it from Vivian.

545
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,125
-Hello? -Hey, it's me.

546
00:38:36,562 --> 00:38:40,191
it's Elle! Guess what l'm doing right this second!

547
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:41,730
l don't know. What?

548
00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:44,528
l'm picking out my wedding dress!

549
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:47,298
-What? -Josh proposed!

550
00:38:47,573 --> 00:38:50,337
Did you get the rock yet?

551
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:53,444
Almost.

552
00:38:53,846 --> 00:38:55,780
Well, hurry up, so you can come home!

553
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:57,007
We miss you!

554
00:38:57,283 --> 00:39:00,218
l miss you guys, too. The people here are so vile.

555
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:02,018
Hardly anybody speaks to me...

556
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:04,487
Oh, my God! l almost forgot to tell you!

557
00:39:05,057 --> 00:39:06,046
What?

558
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:08,786
l got bangs! My hair is so now.

559
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:09,688
Really?

560
00:39:09,795 --> 00:39:12,195
OK, so just listen to me.

561
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:15,127
Keep June 1 st open, you're one of my bridesmaids...

562
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,492
and give Warner our love...

563
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:19,732
because l'm getting married!

564
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:33,710
So don't forget. Eight o'clock at 45 Duns tn Street.

565
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:36,185
-it'll be a really nice party. -We'll be there.

566
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:38,583
And don't forget to bring your own merlot!

567
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:42,190
No way! ls somebody at this school actually having a party?

568
00:39:42,328 --> 00:39:44,262
Yes...

569
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,565
But it's a costume party.

570
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:49,895
You probably wouldn't want to come.

571
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:53,466
l love costume parties.

572
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:57,673
Well, then l guess we'll see you there.

573
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:03,409
Oh, at 45 Duns ton Street.

574
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:24,895
Oh, my God!

575
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:45,956
Thanks for inviting me, girls. This party is super fun.

576
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:49,060
Nice outfit.

577
00:40:50,129 --> 00:40:51,357
l like your outfit, too.

578
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,293
Except when l dress up as a frigid bitch...

579
00:40:53,532 --> 00:40:55,159
l try not to look so constipated.

580
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:01,837
Oh, she's horrible.

581
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:03,972
You've got the ring, sweetie.

582
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,007
-Nice ears. -How you doing'?

583
00:41:10,382 --> 00:41:11,872
Warner, the English language...

584
00:41:12,051 --> 00:41:14,178
is all about subliminal domination.

585
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,912
Take the word semester.

586
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:18,419
A perfect example of this school's...

587
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:20,354
discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries.

588
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:21,516
That's why l'm petitioning to have next term...

589
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,458
be referred to as the winter ovester.

590
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,390
-Excuse me. Hey,Warner. -Wow!

591
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,291
Don't you look like a walking felony?

592
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:31,697
Thank you. You're so sweet.

593
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:34,595
Are you having fun?

594
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:38,235
l am now. What's with the costume?

595
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:40,372
l just decided to dress up.

596
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:42,139
Really.

597
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,476
l feel like we barely get to see each other...

598
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,607
since we've been here.

599
00:41:45,718 --> 00:41:48,243
l know. l'm so busy with these case studies and hypos.

600
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,488
l know what you mean. l can't imagine doing...

601
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:52,819
all this and Callahan's internship next year.

602
00:41:53,192 --> 00:41:55,183
That's gonna be so much.

603
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:57,922
Elle, come on, you'll never get the grades...

604
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,725
to qualify for one of those spots.

605
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:02,231
You're not smart enough, sweetie.

606
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:05,829
Wait, am l on glue...

607
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:07,666
or did we not get into the same law school?

608
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:09,569
Yeah, but...

609
00:42:09,842 --> 00:42:12,072
But what? We took the same LSATs...

610
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:14,438
and we're taking the same classes.

611
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:17,673
l know, but come on, Elle, be serious.

612
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:20,413
You can do something more valuable with your time.

613
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,351
l'm never going to be good enough for you, am l?

614
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:35,227
-Oh, come on. -Just forget it!

615
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:40,771
l'll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be!

616
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:56,278
-Don't ask. -Wasn't gonna.

617
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,657
l love that sweater. it's Chanel.

618
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:12,928
Look.

619
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:15,163
Was she carrying books?

620
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:25,011
Thanks.

621
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,447
So,you've filed a claim.

622
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:31,982
What next?

623
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,691
Ms. Woods?

624
00:43:37,496 --> 00:43:39,191
Don't you need to have evidence?

625
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:41,090
Meaning?

626
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,633
Meaning you need reasonable belief...

627
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,707
that your claim should have, like, evidenciary support?

628
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,140
And what kind of evidenciary support...

629
00:43:55,514 --> 00:43:56,879
does this case require?

630
00:44:06,158 --> 00:44:07,455
All sorts of things...

631
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:15,261
corrupt cops who are wheeling and dealing...

632
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:28,810
And the purpose of diminished capacity is?

633
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:32,980
To negate mens rea?

634
00:44:53,038 --> 00:44:54,266
Are you ready?

635
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,843
Yes, you are!

636
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:01,470
Go. You can do this.

637
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,809
Listen to me, Dewey. You shut your mouth.

638
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,846
No, you shut your big mouth.

639
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,355
l'm doing all the talking.

640
00:45:24,536 --> 00:45:25,764
What the hell do you want?

641
00:45:26,672 --> 00:45:27,764
We're eating lunch.

642
00:45:28,473 --> 00:45:30,134
l just thought that...

643
00:45:30,776 --> 00:45:33,370
You just thought you could come here...

644
00:45:33,478 --> 00:45:34,843
and show me what l'm definitely not missing?

645
00:45:37,616 --> 00:45:39,174
That's not why l came by.

646
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:41,442
How many times you gonna come over here...

647
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:43,316
begging me to take you back, huh?

648
00:45:44,056 --> 00:45:45,421
l was...

649
00:45:47,226 --> 00:45:48,488
Dewey New combe?

650
00:45:49,027 --> 00:45:50,187
Who's asking?

651
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,656
l'm Elle Woods. Miss Bonifante's attorney.

652
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,960
And l'm here to discuss the legal situation at hand.

653
00:45:58,203 --> 00:45:59,227
Come again?

654
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,834
Do you understand what subject matter jurisdiction is?

655
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,835
-No. -l didn't think so.

656
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,470
Well, due to habeas corpus...

657
00:46:09,081 --> 00:46:12,278
you and Miss Bonifante had a common law marriage...

658
00:46:12,718 --> 00:46:15,619
which here to fore entitles her...

659
00:46:15,754 --> 00:46:17,585
to what is legally referred to...

660
00:46:17,723 --> 00:46:19,691
as equitable division of the assets.

661
00:46:21,293 --> 00:46:22,419
Come again?

662
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:26,027
Due to the fact that you've retained this residence...

663
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:28,597
Miss Bonifante is entitled...

664
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,725
to full canine property ownership...

665
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:34,428
and will be enforcing said ownership right now.

666
00:46:37,743 --> 00:46:38,869
Tell him, Paulette.

667
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:47,311
l'm taking the dog, dumbass!

668
00:46:49,354 --> 00:46:51,049
That's awesome! We did it!

669
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:54,552
Come here.

670
00:46:57,696 --> 00:46:59,186
Oh, my gosh, did you see him?

671
00:46:59,298 --> 00:47:00,856
He's probably still scratching his head.

672
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:03,058
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls.

673
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:14,643
Thank you.

674
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:22,883
According to Swinney vs. Neubert...

675
00:47:23,155 --> 00:47:25,089
Swinney,who was also a private sperm donor...

676
00:47:25,223 --> 00:47:27,657
was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms...

677
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:29,988
with the hours set forth by the parents.

678
00:47:30,128 --> 00:47:32,062
So, if we're sticking to past precedent...

679
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:34,891
Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

680
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:38,668
He was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation.

681
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:42,236
But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor...

682
00:47:42,441 --> 00:47:45,535
and our defendant was an habitual sperm donor...

683
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:48,474
who also happens to be harassing the parents...

684
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,877
in his quest for visitation.

685
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,642
But without this man's sperm...

686
00:47:52,818 --> 00:47:55,878
the child in question wouldn't exist.

687
00:47:56,288 --> 00:47:57,778
Now you're thinking like a lawyer.

688
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:04,360
Yes, Ms. Woods?

689
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,696
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point...

690
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,700
l have to wonder if the defendant...

691
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:12,167
kept a thorough record of every sperm emission...

692
00:48:12,304 --> 00:48:13,703
made throughout his life.

693
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:18,170
interesting. Why do you ask?

694
00:48:18,844 --> 00:48:22,245
Unless the defendant attempted to contact...

695
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:24,281
every single one-night stand to determine...

696
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:26,180
if a child resulted in those unions...

697
00:48:26,418 --> 00:48:29,478
he has no parental claim over this child whatsoever.

698
00:48:29,721 --> 00:48:31,313
Why now? Why this sperm?

699
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:34,784
l see your point.

700
00:48:34,893 --> 00:48:38,260
And for that matter, all masturbatory emissions...

701
00:48:38,363 --> 00:48:40,024
where his sperm was clearly not seeking an egg...

702
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:41,497
could be termed reckless abandonment.

703
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:45,632
l believe you've just won your case.

704
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:52,342
Ms. Woods, you did well today.

705
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:54,075
Really?

706
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:56,775
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?

707
00:48:57,749 --> 00:48:58,681
l don't know.

708
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:00,679
You should. Do you have a resume?

709
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:02,750
Yes, l do.

710
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:08,483
Here it is.

711
00:49:10,428 --> 00:49:11,326
it's pink.

712
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:12,496
And it's scented.

713
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:14,221
l think it gives it a little something extra.

714
00:49:14,332 --> 00:49:18,598
See you next class.

715
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:26,068
Do you think she woke up one morning and said...

716
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:28,169
l think l'll go to law school today.

717
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,048
That lapse in judgment aside...

718
00:49:31,182 --> 00:49:32,444
l think she's got a lot of potential.

719
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:35,083
Here's the Wind hamfile.

720
00:49:36,154 --> 00:49:37,086
Smell this.

721
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:41,316
What's that?

722
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:42,651
it's her resume.

723
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:44,753
Smells good.

724
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:10,788
What's going on?

725
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:13,219
Callahan's firm is defending a murder trial.

726
00:50:13,525 --> 00:50:16,585
His case load is so big, he's taking first year interns.

727
00:50:17,162 --> 00:50:18,288
He picked them already?

728
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,363
My God, l can't believe it, Warner!

729
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:22,125
We got it!

730
00:50:24,903 --> 00:50:26,427
That only leaves one for...

731
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:33,634
Me!

732
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:35,711
Yes!

733
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:49,617
Remember when we spent those four amazing hours...

734
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:51,626
in the hot tub after winter formal?

735
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:53,762
Yeah...No.

736
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:57,424
This is so much better than that!

737
00:50:58,636 --> 00:51:00,866
Excuse me. l have some shopping to do.

738
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,405
Four hours?

739
00:51:25,964 --> 00:51:27,556
You look very nice today, Vivian.

740
00:51:29,267 --> 00:51:30,165
Thank you.

741
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:32,093
You're welcome.

742
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:44,673
We're defending Brooke Windham...

743
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:47,280
whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death...

744
00:51:47,419 --> 00:51:48,716
in their Beacon Hill mansion.

745
00:51:48,987 --> 00:51:50,011
Gold digger?

746
00:51:50,321 --> 00:51:51,982
You'd think so since the stiff was 60...

747
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,115
but she was rich on her own.

748
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:55,849
Some kind of fitness empire.

749
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:58,087
You can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials.

750
00:51:58,763 --> 00:52:00,697
Are you talking about Brooke Taylor?

751
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:03,929
Maiden name...Taylor.

752
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:05,995
You know her?

753
00:52:06,304 --> 00:52:07,328
She's a Delta Nu!

754
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:09,000
She wasn't in my pledge class.

755
00:52:09,107 --> 00:52:11,200
She graduated four years before me.

756
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:13,843
But l used to take her class at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

757
00:52:13,978 --> 00:52:15,377
She's amazing!

758
00:52:16,314 --> 00:52:17,406
Amazing? How?

759
00:52:17,982 --> 00:52:20,041
She can make you lose three pounds in one class.

760
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:21,910
She's completely gifted.

761
00:52:22,187 --> 00:52:24,348
in all likelihood, she's completely guilty.

762
00:52:24,456 --> 00:52:27,914
She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.

763
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:29,351
By who?

764
00:52:29,594 --> 00:52:31,926
His 26-year-old daughter and the pool boy.

765
00:52:33,164 --> 00:52:35,064
Sorry, l'm late. Excuse me.

766
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:37,530
This is Emmett Richmond, another associate...

767
00:52:37,702 --> 00:52:39,567
top three in his class...

768
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:41,298
and former editor of Harvard Law Review.

769
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:42,936
You've probably seen him...

770
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:44,565
lurking around campus doing my research.

771
00:52:44,976 --> 00:52:46,238
Thanks for the introduction.

772
00:52:46,744 --> 00:52:48,473
What about the murder weapon?

773
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:50,241
The gun is missing.

774
00:52:50,381 --> 00:52:52,008
The coroner said he'd been dead 30 minutes...

775
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:53,208
when the cops arrived.

776
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:55,252
Giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it.

777
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,479
l just don't think Brooke could have done this.

778
00:52:57,956 --> 00:52:59,787
Exercise gives you endorphins.

779
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:01,586
Endorphins make you happy.

780
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,661
Happy people don't shoot their husbands.

781
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:07,357
They just don't.

782
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:09,461
l didn't do it.

783
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:11,327
l walked in...

784
00:53:11,503 --> 00:53:13,630
l saw my husband lying on the floor...

785
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:16,702
l bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off...

786
00:53:16,841 --> 00:53:18,069
then Enrique and Chutney ran inside.

787
00:53:18,176 --> 00:53:20,576
Your step-daughter and the pool boy came in...

788
00:53:20,712 --> 00:53:22,236
where they saw you standing over the body...

789
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:24,076
covered in his blood.

790
00:53:27,218 --> 00:53:29,015
Why would l kill my husband?

791
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,385
insurance, a love affair, pure unadulterated hatred.

792
00:53:32,524 --> 00:53:34,754
The D.A. will come up with plenty of reasons.

793
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:36,988
l loved him.

794
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:40,892
He was 34 years older than you.

795
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:43,523
That doesn't look so good to a jury.

796
00:53:43,902 --> 00:53:45,494
Then show them a picture of his dick.

797
00:53:46,604 --> 00:53:48,333
That might clear a few things up.

798
00:53:50,942 --> 00:53:53,342
Brooke, l believe you...

799
00:53:53,478 --> 00:53:56,311
but a jury is going to want an alibi.

800
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:58,178
l can't give you that...

801
00:53:58,683 --> 00:54:00,981
and if you put me on the stand, l'll lie.

802
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:05,055
Then l guess we're done for today.

803
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:16,597
l know you.

804
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:19,798
l'm a Delta Nu, and l'm a huge fan of yours.

805
00:54:20,905 --> 00:54:22,099
You took my class in L.A.

806
00:54:22,206 --> 00:54:23,798
You took my class in L.A.

807
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:25,739
You had the best high-kick l've ever seen.

808
00:54:26,277 --> 00:54:27,539
Are you one of my lawyers?

809
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:28,703
Sort of.

810
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:31,571
Well, thank God one of you has a brain.

811
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,708
Let's go.

812
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:39,489
l'm the only one that believes her.

813
00:54:39,591 --> 00:54:41,388
Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.

814
00:54:41,526 --> 00:54:43,790
That's because men are big fat retards who don't...

815
00:54:43,895 --> 00:54:46,295
Afternoon, ladies.

816
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:48,732
it's him.

817
00:54:49,634 --> 00:54:51,033
Paulette Bonifante.

818
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:53,559
Oh, my God.

819
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:57,469
He's coming over here.

820
00:55:01,546 --> 00:55:02,638
l've got a package.

821
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:07,681
He's got a package.

822
00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:22,057
How you doing today?

823
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:24,091
Fine.

824
00:55:30,608 --> 00:55:31,802
Take it easy.

825
00:55:33,344 --> 00:55:34,436
See you later.

826
00:55:36,881 --> 00:55:37,848
That's great, Paulette.

827
00:55:38,082 --> 00:55:39,447
ls this the only interaction you two have ever had?

828
00:55:40,551 --> 00:55:44,282
No. Sometimes l say OK instead of fine.

829
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,087
Why don't you offer him a cold beverage...

830
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,525
or a neck massage or something?

831
00:55:50,662 --> 00:55:51,924
What's the point?

832
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:55,029
Trust me, Paulette. You have all the equipment...

833
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,326
you just need to read the manual.

834
00:55:58,269 --> 00:55:59,566
Do you know what l'm saying?

835
00:56:01,305 --> 00:56:02,499
l'll show you a little maneuver...

836
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,198
my mother taught me in junior high.

837
00:56:04,475 --> 00:56:07,376
in my experience, it has a 98% success rate...

838
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:09,308
of getting a man's attention...

839
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:10,676
and when used appropriately...

840
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:14,081
it has an 83% rate of return on a dinner invitation.

841
00:56:14,218 --> 00:56:15,185
Wow!

842
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:17,651
it's called the bend and snap.

843
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:20,847
Watch this.

844
00:56:23,461 --> 00:56:24,826
Oh! l think l dropped something on the floor.

845
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:29,764
So you bend...and snap!

846
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:31,025
See?

847
00:56:31,502 --> 00:56:32,491
Come on. You try it.

848
00:56:37,108 --> 00:56:40,202
Bend...and snap!

849
00:56:40,678 --> 00:56:41,474
OK...

850
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:43,171
a little less bend, a little more snap.

851
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:46,044
Like this?

852
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:48,511
Good snap.

853
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,914
Come on.

854
00:56:50,988 --> 00:56:54,253
You! Come on, you can do it.

855
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:57,021
Bend...and snap.

856
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,891
Very, very good.

857
00:57:00,531 --> 00:57:01,395
We can all do it!

858
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:03,023
-Come on, guys. -l can't do that.

859
00:57:04,302 --> 00:57:05,735
You're gonna bend...

860
00:57:05,837 --> 00:57:07,270
and snap!

861
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:08,736
Now put your head into it.

862
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:11,137
Bend...and snap!

863
00:57:11,843 --> 00:57:14,937
Bend...and snap! Good job!

864
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:17,403
A little attitude, please.

865
00:57:17,615 --> 00:57:20,106
Now, everybody smile. That's very important.

866
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,987
Pump! Pump! Pump!

867
00:57:24,088 --> 00:57:25,555
Bend...and snap!

868
00:57:25,823 --> 00:57:27,290
Good job, everybody!

869
00:57:28,993 --> 00:57:30,585
Work it out! Work it out!

870
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:32,689
That's it! Wow!

871
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:35,823
Come on, Paulette!

872
00:57:38,202 --> 00:57:40,670
Bend and snap!

873
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:44,634
Oh, my God! The bend and snap! Works every time!

874
00:57:46,444 --> 00:57:49,345
lf Brooke didn't kill the guy, then who did?

875
00:57:50,014 --> 00:57:52,312
My money is on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

876
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:53,973
Chutney has a trust fund.

877
00:57:54,085 --> 00:57:56,212
She didn't need the insurance payoff or the inheritance.

878
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:57,647
What about the mother?

879
00:57:57,789 --> 00:57:59,256
Covered. She was in Aspen at the time.

880
00:57:59,357 --> 00:58:00,756
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

881
00:58:00,858 --> 00:58:04,225
Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans...

882
00:58:04,562 --> 00:58:05,529
at the Caribou Club.

883
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:06,619
All l know is it's not Brooke.

884
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:09,063
That's touching, but we need an alibi.

885
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,167
l brought you some necessities...

886
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:16,297
some Calvin Klein 720-count sheets...

887
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:19,041
the entire Clinique skin care line...

888
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:22,310
some aromatherapy candles, a loofah...

889
00:58:23,014 --> 00:58:26,313
And the Bible.

890
00:58:27,685 --> 00:58:28,879
You're an angel.

891
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:32,079
So how are you? Are you all right?

892
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:34,847
You look so...orange.

893
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,258
l'm just glad it's you and not Callahan.

894
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:41,495
He means well. He's very brilliant.

895
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,624
He better befor what l'm paying for him.

896
00:58:45,236 --> 00:58:47,363
l have to tell you the real reason l came here.

897
00:58:47,538 --> 00:58:50,200
Professor Callahan says we really need your alibi.

898
00:58:51,342 --> 00:58:53,970
Elle, l can't.

899
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:56,778
You don't understand.

900
00:58:57,348 --> 00:58:58,838
Who could understand better than me?

901
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:02,317
it's so shameful.

902
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:05,255
Whatever it is, Brooke, it could save you.

903
00:59:05,356 --> 00:59:07,620
That's just it. lt would ruin me.

904
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,719
How?

905
00:59:12,897 --> 00:59:15,024
l've made my fortune on the ability...

906
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:18,100
to perfect women's bodies with Brooke's Butt-Buster workout.

907
00:59:18,269 --> 00:59:20,169
You helped me go from a six to a four.

908
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:21,704
That's great!

909
00:59:22,273 --> 00:59:27,370
On the day of Heyworth's murder...

910
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,244
l was getting...

911
00:59:36,254 --> 00:59:37,152
What?

912
00:59:37,788 --> 00:59:40,382
l was getting liposuction.

913
00:59:41,392 --> 00:59:42,825
Liposuction!

914
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:44,821
Oh, God!

915
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:46,987
l know! l'm a fraud!

916
00:59:47,398 --> 00:59:49,593
it's not like normal women can have this ass!

917
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:51,992
lf my fans knew that l bought it...

918
00:59:52,136 --> 00:59:53,501
l would lose everything!

919
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,469
l've already lost my husband.

920
01:00:01,212 --> 01:00:03,772
l'd rather go to jail than lose my reputation.

921
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:08,776
Brooke... your secret's safe with me.

922
01:00:12,823 --> 01:00:13,881
Thank you.

923
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,919
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

924
01:00:18,863 --> 01:00:20,194
We got two interviews tomorrow...

925
01:00:20,298 --> 01:00:21,765
that Gerard and Bobby will handle.

926
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:23,093
The ex-wife in an hour.

927
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,327
According to this communique from the prison...

928
01:00:25,903 --> 01:00:28,269
our client apparently had a visit from her sister...

929
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,640
a Miss Delta Nu.

930
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:35,376
Anyone you know?

931
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,547
Yes. l went to visit her.

932
01:00:38,282 --> 01:00:39,874
What the hell do you mean you went to visit her?

933
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:41,178
l went to get her alibi.

934
01:00:41,452 --> 01:00:42,510
Did you get it?

935
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:44,853
it's really good.

936
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:47,291
Great. What is it?

937
01:00:47,558 --> 01:00:49,389
l can't tell you.

938
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:51,352
Why the hell not?

939
01:00:51,495 --> 01:00:53,463
Because l promised her l'd keep it a secret...

940
01:00:53,564 --> 01:00:55,395
and l can't break the bonds of sisterhood.

941
01:00:55,499 --> 01:00:58,024
Screw sisterhood! This is a murder trial...

942
01:00:58,135 --> 01:01:00,433
not some scandal at the sorority house.

943
01:01:00,604 --> 01:01:01,969
l want the alibi!

944
01:01:02,106 --> 01:01:03,300
l can't give it to you...

945
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,767
but l can tell you she is innocent.

946
01:01:07,278 --> 01:01:10,179
Mrs. Windham Vander mark is on line two for you.

947
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:13,245
Someone reason with her while l take this.

948
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,417
Are you crazy? Just tell him the alibi.

949
01:01:17,788 --> 01:01:19,949
We'll lose this case if you don't.

950
01:01:20,057 --> 01:01:21,615
Then we're not very good lawyers.

951
01:01:21,759 --> 01:01:24,660
lf you tell him, he'll probably hire you as a summer associate.

952
01:01:25,363 --> 01:01:26,421
Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.

953
01:01:26,564 --> 01:01:28,225
Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.

954
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:31,801
l gave her my word, Warner.

955
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:33,229
So what?

956
01:01:37,742 --> 01:01:39,676
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned...

957
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:41,574
with the fact that her interview is today.

958
01:01:41,712 --> 01:01:43,577
She's at a spa in the Berkshires.

959
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:46,650
A spa? lsn't that like your mother ship?

960
01:01:47,485 --> 01:01:49,009
l could go if you want me to.

961
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,554
Emmett? Go with her.

962
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:06,293
She seems completely untrustworthy to me.

963
01:02:06,404 --> 01:02:07,462
Why?

964
01:02:07,571 --> 01:02:09,732
This is a person who's made her living...

965
01:02:09,874 --> 01:02:11,569
by telling women that they're too fat.

966
01:02:11,742 --> 01:02:14,176
Brooke would never tell a woman she was too fat.

967
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:16,576
And she seems like she's hiding something.

968
01:02:16,714 --> 01:02:19,205
Maybe it's not what you think.

969
01:02:19,383 --> 01:02:20,975
Maybe it's exactly what l think.

970
01:02:22,853 --> 01:02:24,320
You're really being a butthead.

971
01:02:25,456 --> 01:02:26,718
A butthead?

972
01:02:26,824 --> 01:02:28,018
Why would you call me that?

973
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:30,552
You need to have a little more faith in people.

974
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:31,753
You might be surprised.

975
01:02:34,465 --> 01:02:36,160
l can't believe you called me a butthead.

976
01:02:36,267 --> 01:02:38,326
No one's called me that since the ninth grade.

977
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:41,502
Maybe not to your face.

978
01:02:44,642 --> 01:02:47,042
So this is what a spa looks like. Wow.

979
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:48,539
How do we find her?

980
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:50,044
l called ahead. She's in the mud room.

981
01:02:50,147 --> 01:02:52,445
She's not naked, is she?

982
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:57,110
Mrs. Windham Vander mark?

983
01:02:59,824 --> 01:03:01,758
So you found me.

984
01:03:02,193 --> 01:03:05,651
We're from Austen, Platt, Jaret, and Callahan...

985
01:03:05,763 --> 01:03:07,128
and we're here to ask you a few questions.

986
01:03:08,566 --> 01:03:11,262
So l hear that little tart from California...

987
01:03:11,368 --> 01:03:12,699
shot poor Heyworth.

988
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:15,795
That's what we're trying to prove didn't happen.

989
01:03:15,906 --> 01:03:17,874
Do you have any reason to believe that it did?

990
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:20,539
l've never actually met the woman...

991
01:03:20,778 --> 01:03:22,109
but my daughter tells me...

992
01:03:22,213 --> 01:03:23,908
she can be quite the little bitch.

993
01:03:24,115 --> 01:03:27,050
Did your daughter ever mention anything...

994
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:29,676
about the relationship between Brooke and Heyworth?

995
01:03:30,754 --> 01:03:34,315
She did say that they humped like gorillas.

996
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:38,060
l guess it wasn't enough, though, for Brooke.

997
01:03:39,497 --> 01:03:40,555
Why do you say that?

998
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:42,288
Well...

999
01:03:42,766 --> 01:03:44,791
haven't you seen the cabana boy?

1000
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:47,997
She's lying.

1001
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:50,030
And you know this for a fact?

1002
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:52,572
Did you see the icky brown color of her hair?

1003
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,611
So? Now you discriminate against brunettes?

1004
01:03:55,713 --> 01:03:58,147
Why not? l'm discriminated against as a blonde.

1005
01:03:58,249 --> 01:04:00,843
Being a blonde is actually a pretty powerful thing.

1006
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:02,475
You hold more cards than you think you do.

1007
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,885
l personally would like to see you take that power...

1008
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07,981
and channel it towards the greater good.

1009
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,988
Thanks. l'll see you tomorrow.

1010
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:13,256
All right.

1011
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,692
How do you think l'd look as a blonde?

1012
01:04:18,669 --> 01:04:20,136
l'm not sure you could handle it.

1013
01:04:20,804 --> 01:04:22,362
-Good night. -Bye.

1014
01:04:32,683 --> 01:04:34,378
So, l called your room last night.

1015
01:04:34,518 --> 01:04:35,416
l heard.

1016
01:04:35,553 --> 01:04:37,521
l was thinking maybe we could go out sometime.

1017
01:04:37,688 --> 01:04:39,121
No. You're a dork.

1018
01:04:40,391 --> 01:04:42,291
l'm in law school.

1019
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,489
Look, l'm not going out with you.

1020
01:04:44,728 --> 01:04:46,195
l can't believe you'd even ask.

1021
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,060
Girls like me don't go out with losers like you.

1022
01:04:50,467 --> 01:04:51,627
Let's get out of here.

1023
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:52,961
Excuse me.

1024
01:04:57,308 --> 01:04:58,502
Why didn't you call me?

1025
01:04:58,876 --> 01:04:59,900
What?

1026
01:05:00,077 --> 01:05:01,169
We spent a beautiful night together...

1027
01:05:01,312 --> 01:05:02,643
and l never hear from you again?

1028
01:05:03,581 --> 01:05:04,741
l...

1029
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:08,544
l'm sorry?

1030
01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:10,244
Sorry for what? For breaking my heart...

1031
01:05:10,354 --> 01:05:11,753
or for giving me the greatest pleasure...

1032
01:05:11,855 --> 01:05:14,415
l've ever known and then just taking it away?

1033
01:05:15,993 --> 01:05:17,984
Both?

1034
01:05:19,163 --> 01:05:20,152
Well, forget it.

1035
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:22,232
l've spent too many hours crying over you.

1036
01:05:26,971 --> 01:05:29,439
So...when did you want to go out?

1037
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:37,439
Come in.

1038
01:05:42,653 --> 01:05:44,518
Are you done with that deposition yet?

1039
01:05:44,688 --> 01:05:46,747
Yeah. Here, take it.

1040
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:48,353
l've read it 20 times.

1041
01:05:58,769 --> 01:06:02,535
You know, Elle, l still can't believe...

1042
01:06:02,706 --> 01:06:04,571
you didn't tell Callahan the alibi.

1043
01:06:05,843 --> 01:06:07,367
it's not my alibi to tell.

1044
01:06:08,112 --> 01:06:09,306
l know.

1045
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,338
And l thought that was very classy of you.

1046
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:16,677
Really?

1047
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:18,279
Sure.

1048
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:20,754
Thanks.

1049
01:06:28,932 --> 01:06:32,265
Did you ever notice how Callahan never asks Warner...

1050
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:33,358
to bring him his coffee?

1051
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,200
He's asked me at least ten times.

1052
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:38,908
Men are helpless. You know that.

1053
01:06:40,678 --> 01:06:42,703
l know. Warner doesn't even do his own laundry.

1054
01:06:42,846 --> 01:06:44,438
He has to have it sent out.

1055
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:46,373
l know.

1056
01:06:49,086 --> 01:06:50,883
Did you know when he first applied...

1057
01:06:51,155 --> 01:06:52,622
he got wait-listed.

1058
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,618
What?

1059
01:06:56,694 --> 01:06:58,127
His father had to make a call.

1060
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:00,456
You're kidding.

1061
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:03,565
No way!

1062
01:07:08,772 --> 01:07:11,605
God, that is such a precious dog.

1063
01:07:11,942 --> 01:07:13,842
His name is Bruiser. Do you want to hold him?

1064
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:16,976
-He's very friendly. -Sure.

1065
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:22,947
Look, he likes you.

1066
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:25,547
He's giving me kisses.

1067
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:29,948
Thanks, Jeff.

1068
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,551
We're here today covering the trial of Brooke Windham.

1069
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:35,524
She's charged with the murder of her husband...

1070
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:37,699
Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham.

1071
01:07:38,202 --> 01:07:41,171
First to testify are the victim's daughter and ex-wife.

1072
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:44,065
The Superior Court of Suffolk County is now in session.

1073
01:07:44,174 --> 01:07:46,506
The Honorable Judge Marina R. Bickford presiding.

1074
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,538
You may be seated.

1075
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,583
And where was she exactly?

1076
01:07:58,956 --> 01:08:01,083
Standing over my father's dead body.

1077
01:08:03,193 --> 01:08:04,888
And what was the defendant doing?

1078
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:08,957
She was sitting next to the pool, topless...

1079
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:11,728
while the Latin boy handed her a drink.

1080
01:08:14,538 --> 01:08:17,871
Mr. Salvatore, can you tell us what this is?

1081
01:08:19,543 --> 01:08:20,771
My uniform.

1082
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:24,206
This is the uniform...

1083
01:08:24,415 --> 01:08:27,942
Mrs. Windham asked you to wear while cleaning her pool?

1084
01:08:33,557 --> 01:08:36,458
Are you having an affair with Brooke Windham?

1085
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,394
Define affair.

1086
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:44,995
Have you and Mrs. Windham had sexual relations?

1087
01:08:46,637 --> 01:08:49,197
Yes. OK? Yes.

1088
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:56,403
Ladies and gentlemen, court will reconvene...

1089
01:08:56,814 --> 01:08:58,975
tomorrow morning at 9 A.M.

1090
01:08:59,616 --> 01:09:00,742
We're adjourned.

1091
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:06,612
A Delta Nu would never sleep with a man who wears a thong.

1092
01:09:06,857 --> 01:09:07,687
Never!

1093
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,554
l just liked watching him clean the filter.

1094
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,092
l believe you, Brooke.

1095
01:09:12,396 --> 01:09:13,863
-Take care of me, Elle. -l will.

1096
01:09:34,952 --> 01:09:36,442
l got a big one for you.

1097
01:09:43,627 --> 01:09:44,719
Can you sign?

1098
01:10:21,632 --> 01:10:22,564
l got it.

1099
01:10:27,304 --> 01:10:28,566
You broke his nose?

1100
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:30,104
l blew it, Elle.

1101
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,299
My snap was all over the place.

1102
01:10:32,476 --> 01:10:34,000
l'll be there as soon as court is out.

1103
01:10:34,111 --> 01:10:35,442
We have to cross-examine Enrique.

1104
01:10:35,646 --> 01:10:36,977
But don't worry. My girlfriend Serena...

1105
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,105
barfed on a guy during The Blair Witch Project...

1106
01:10:39,249 --> 01:10:40,477
and they ended up dating for three months.

1107
01:10:40,617 --> 01:10:42,585
Really? All right. Bye-bye.

1108
01:10:42,686 --> 01:10:43,880
OK. Bye.

1109
01:10:55,732 --> 01:10:58,724
Don't stomp your little last-season Prada shoes at me.

1110
01:11:01,438 --> 01:11:02,632
These aren't last season.

1111
01:11:09,513 --> 01:11:13,643
-He's gay! Enrique's gay! -What?

1112
01:11:14,351 --> 01:11:15,978
What kind of shoes are these?

1113
01:11:16,219 --> 01:11:18,187
Black ones.

1114
01:11:18,555 --> 01:11:20,182
-See! -What are you talking about?

1115
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:23,756
He isn't Brooke's lover. He's making it up.

1116
01:11:24,461 --> 01:11:26,156
Back up. How do you know he's gay?

1117
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:29,157
Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.

1118
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:30,600
Know what?

1119
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:32,931
He left a Chertape in the pool house one time.

1120
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:37,365
While l appreciate your masterful legal theory...

1121
01:11:37,474 --> 01:11:39,305
l have a murder trial to attend to.

1122
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:46,213
l'll take care of it. Thanks.

1123
01:11:46,617 --> 01:11:49,017
The court will come to order.

1124
01:11:55,993 --> 01:11:58,723
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof...

1125
01:11:58,829 --> 01:12:02,321
that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?

1126
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,028
Only the love in my heart.

1127
01:12:05,702 --> 01:12:09,468
lf that's all the proof that he has, Your Honor...

1128
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:10,765
l think l'm done here.

1129
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,639
You may step down.

1130
01:12:12,743 --> 01:12:14,506
l'd like to ask a couple of questions, Your Honor.

1131
01:12:16,213 --> 01:12:17,680
Just give me a couple minutes.

1132
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,643
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?

1133
01:12:23,086 --> 01:12:24,849
-Yes. -Where?

1134
01:12:25,088 --> 01:12:27,318
A restaurant where no one could recognize us.

1135
01:12:27,724 --> 01:12:29,692
How long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?

1136
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:30,418
Three months.

1137
01:12:30,527 --> 01:12:32,017
-And your boyfriend's name is... -Chuck.

1138
01:12:38,068 --> 01:12:39,194
Silence!

1139
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:40,525
Pardon me!

1140
01:12:40,637 --> 01:12:41,661
Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

1141
01:12:41,772 --> 01:12:43,296
l was confused.

1142
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,204
l thought you said friend. Chuck is just a friend.

1143
01:12:47,544 --> 01:12:48,704
You bitch!

1144
01:12:50,213 --> 01:12:51,145
Chuck, wait!

1145
01:12:52,049 --> 01:12:54,210
Silence in my court! Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

1146
01:12:57,854 --> 01:13:00,084
Silence in my courtroom!

1147
01:13:01,324 --> 01:13:03,724
How did l miss that? You were great.

1148
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:05,517
Silence in my courtroom!

1149
01:13:07,431 --> 01:13:08,398
Thanks.

1150
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:14,393
-Good night. -Good night.

1151
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:21,408
Callahan asked to see you before you leave.

1152
01:13:21,645 --> 01:13:22,339
Really?

1153
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:24,914
He already has coffee, but maybe he needs a doughnut.

1154
01:13:26,283 --> 01:13:27,910
-Do you need any help? -No. l'm fine.

1155
01:13:28,018 --> 01:13:29,246
OK. Bye.

1156
01:13:34,491 --> 01:13:35,549
Come on in.

1157
01:13:38,562 --> 01:13:39,824
Sit down.

1158
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:50,604
ls everything all right?

1159
01:13:51,141 --> 01:13:52,733
You followed your intuition today...

1160
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:55,605
and you were right on target.

1161
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,745
l should have listened.

1162
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:00,644
Thank you.

1163
01:14:02,452 --> 01:14:03,476
About the alibi...

1164
01:14:03,987 --> 01:14:04,612
l'm sorry...

1165
01:14:04,721 --> 01:14:07,315
l'm impressed you took the initiative to go get it.

1166
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:09,424
That's what makes a good lawyer.

1167
01:14:10,293 --> 01:14:12,557
On top of that, you gained the client's trust...

1168
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,694
and kept it...that's what makes a great lawyer.

1169
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:17,696
You're smart, Elle.

1170
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:20,636
Smarter than most of the guys on my payroll.

1171
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:22,831
Wow.

1172
01:14:24,174 --> 01:14:26,404
l think it's time to discuss your career path.

1173
01:14:26,743 --> 01:14:30,201
Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?

1174
01:14:31,481 --> 01:14:32,971
Not really.

1175
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:35,249
l know it's very competitive.

1176
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:37,615
You know what competition's really about?

1177
01:14:37,754 --> 01:14:43,556
it's about ferocity, carnage.

1178
01:14:44,561 --> 01:14:49,021
Balancing human intelligence with animal diligence.

1179
01:14:50,133 --> 01:14:53,000
Knowing exactly what you want...

1180
01:14:53,703 --> 01:14:55,728
and how far you'll go to get it.

1181
01:14:57,274 --> 01:14:59,834
How far will Elle go?

1182
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:05,444
Are you hitting on me?

1183
01:15:05,816 --> 01:15:07,044
You're a beautiful girl.

1184
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:10,352
So everything you just said...

1185
01:15:10,654 --> 01:15:12,121
l'm a man who knows what he wants.

1186
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:15,624
And l'm a law student who just realized...

1187
01:15:15,759 --> 01:15:17,351
her professor is a pathetic asshole.

1188
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:20,890
Too bad. l thought you were a law student...

1189
01:15:20,997 --> 01:15:22,123
who wanted to be a lawyer!

1190
01:15:40,016 --> 01:15:41,643
You almost had me fooled.

1191
01:15:42,185 --> 01:15:43,345
What?

1192
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:45,655
Maybe you should sleep with the jury, too.

1193
01:15:45,789 --> 01:15:47,051
Then we can win the case.

1194
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,707
l'm quitting.

1195
01:16:05,008 --> 01:16:06,407
Why?

1196
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:09,706
Law school was a mistake. This internship was a mistake.

1197
01:16:09,846 --> 01:16:11,643
What are you talking about? You earned it.

1198
01:16:11,748 --> 01:16:12,772
l didn't earn anything.

1199
01:16:12,883 --> 01:16:16,011
Callahan only gave me that internship...

1200
01:16:16,152 --> 01:16:17,483
because he liked the way l looked.

1201
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:20,389
Which he made clear tonight when he tried to feel me up.

1202
01:16:21,925 --> 01:16:23,449
Callahan did what?

1203
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:27,863
Just forget about it. l'm going back to L.A.

1204
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:30,062
No more boring suits. No more pantyhose.

1205
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:32,031
No more trying to be something that l'm just...

1206
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,530
l'm just not.

1207
01:16:36,006 --> 01:16:37,496
What if you're trying to be somebody you are?

1208
01:16:39,643 --> 01:16:41,167
The hell with Callahan.

1209
01:16:43,513 --> 01:16:45,071
Stay.

1210
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:50,786
Call me if you're ever in California.

1211
01:17:08,838 --> 01:17:11,238
What's the point in staying, Paulette?

1212
01:17:12,075 --> 01:17:14,543
All people see when they look at me...

1213
01:17:14,678 --> 01:17:16,077
is blond hair and big boobs.

1214
01:17:16,212 --> 01:17:17,907
No one's ever gonna take me seriously.

1215
01:17:18,481 --> 01:17:20,779
The people at law school don't. Warner doesn't.

1216
01:17:22,419 --> 01:17:24,284
l don't think my own parents take me seriously.

1217
01:17:28,058 --> 01:17:30,390
l just felt, like, for the first time...

1218
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,193
that someone expected me to...

1219
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,488
to do something more with my life...

1220
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:37,759
than become a Victoria's Secret model.

1221
01:17:41,137 --> 01:17:42,729
But l was just kidding myself.

1222
01:17:43,506 --> 01:17:45,030
Callahan never saw me as a lawyer...

1223
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,505
just as a piece of ass.

1224
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:48,704
Just like everybody else.

1225
01:17:51,781 --> 01:17:53,112
Turns out l am a joke.

1226
01:17:55,585 --> 01:17:56,916
No, you're not a joke.

1227
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:07,357
The hell with law school.

1228
01:18:07,797 --> 01:18:09,230
l just wanted to say good-bye.

1229
01:18:11,134 --> 01:18:14,831
lf you're going to let one stupid prick ruin your life...

1230
01:18:21,444 --> 01:18:23,344
you're not the girl l thought you were.

1231
01:18:42,565 --> 01:18:44,032
Did you go in there knowing how to discredit Mr. Salvatore?

1232
01:18:44,134 --> 01:18:44,930
Absolutely.

1233
01:18:45,135 --> 01:18:48,502
it's a little thing l'd like to call strategy.

1234
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:52,208
l had a feeling about Mr. Salvatore...

1235
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:53,900
ls he always such an ass?

1236
01:18:54,144 --> 01:18:56,169
He's the top defense attorney in the state.

1237
01:18:56,312 --> 01:18:57,472
Of course he's an ass.

1238
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,844
Fine. ls he an ass that'll win my case?

1239
01:19:00,784 --> 01:19:02,513
He's an ass that'll try.

1240
01:19:03,053 --> 01:19:03,883
He thinks l'm guilty.

1241
01:19:03,987 --> 01:19:05,887
That's not what's important.

1242
01:19:06,222 --> 01:19:08,315
lf he doesn't trust me, why should l trust him?

1243
01:19:08,992 --> 01:19:11,483
Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy with him last night.

1244
01:19:12,228 --> 01:19:14,594
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.

1245
01:19:17,067 --> 01:19:18,159
What's going on here?

1246
01:19:19,602 --> 01:19:21,194
-Elle quit. -What?

1247
01:19:21,805 --> 01:19:24,171
Callahan hit on her, so she quit.

1248
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:28,009
My God. Scumbag.

1249
01:19:28,912 --> 01:19:30,903
-Oh, God. -What?

1250
01:19:32,582 --> 01:19:35,983
l feel terrible. l made a huge mistake.

1251
01:19:42,792 --> 01:19:45,352
Maybe there's something we can do about it.

1252
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:51,190
Thank you.

1253
01:19:56,306 --> 01:19:58,638
What are you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.

1254
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:00,575
Get up.

1255
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:02,800
What?

1256
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:05,881
You're fired. l have new representation.

1257
01:20:07,117 --> 01:20:08,243
Who?

1258
01:20:31,307 --> 01:20:32,899
Excuse you, you're in my way.

1259
01:20:33,009 --> 01:20:35,000
She's a law student. She can't defend you.

1260
01:20:35,145 --> 01:20:40,344
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling 3.03.

1261
01:20:40,783 --> 01:20:43,684
See? Thank you, David.

1262
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,118
Counselors, approach the bench.

1263
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:49,520
-You're not going up there. -Yes, l am.

1264
01:20:49,759 --> 01:20:52,250
Maybe you didn't hear me. You're fired.

1265
01:20:52,996 --> 01:20:56,227
Counselors, now. All of you.

1266
01:21:01,004 --> 01:21:02,335
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

1267
01:21:02,472 --> 01:21:05,134
Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court...

1268
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:07,266
states that a law student may appear on behalf...

1269
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,900
of a defendant in criminal proceedings.

1270
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:11,238
Your Honor, l have no problem with this.

1271
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:12,905
l do. l'm not allowing it.

1272
01:21:13,016 --> 01:21:15,644
But you agreed last night. in your office...

1273
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:17,446
when we were discussing my career.

1274
01:21:18,454 --> 01:21:20,012
The ruling also states...

1275
01:21:20,156 --> 01:21:23,125
that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you.

1276
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,328
-Mr. Callahan? -That l won't agree to.

1277
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:29,296
l'll supervise, Your Honor.

1278
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,561
Well, Ms. Woods, proceed.

1279
01:21:33,436 --> 01:21:35,028
Thank you,Your Honor.

1280
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:50,346
Enjoy prison.

1281
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:55,254
Mrs. Windham,you do realize what you're doing?

1282
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:57,157
Absolutely.

1283
01:21:59,829 --> 01:22:00,955
Oh, my God! There she is!

1284
01:22:01,097 --> 01:22:03,588
We came to see your trial!

1285
01:22:04,434 --> 01:22:07,562
Look how cute. There's a judge and everything.

1286
01:22:07,971 --> 01:22:11,532
-And jury people. -Vote for Elle!

1287
01:22:11,741 --> 01:22:12,969
Ladies, take a seat.

1288
01:22:14,143 --> 01:22:15,542
Go, girl.

1289
01:22:20,183 --> 01:22:22,083
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...

1290
01:22:22,185 --> 01:22:23,516
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1291
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,780
-l do. -Be seated.

1292
01:22:27,423 --> 01:22:29,687
Ms. Woods, you may begin your questioning.

1293
01:22:32,829 --> 01:22:36,663
First of all l would like to point out...

1294
01:22:36,799 --> 01:22:39,632
that not only is there no proof in this case...

1295
01:22:39,736 --> 01:22:43,103
but there is a complete lack of mens rea...

1296
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:47,573
which by definition tells us there can be no crime...

1297
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,871
without a vicious will.

1298
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,614
l am aware of the meaning of mens rea.

1299
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:54,876
What l'm unaware of...

1300
01:22:55,084 --> 01:22:57,518
is why you're giving me a vocabulary lesson...

1301
01:22:57,654 --> 01:22:59,918
when you should be questioning your witness.

1302
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:03,318
Yes, Your Honor.

1303
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:07,721
Miss Windham...

1304
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:11,100
when you arrived back at the house...

1305
01:23:11,634 --> 01:23:13,864
was your father there?

1306
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:16,563
Not that l saw, but like l said...

1307
01:23:16,673 --> 01:23:18,573
l went straight upstairs to take a shower.

1308
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:24,474
And when you came downstairs, what happened?

1309
01:23:25,081 --> 01:23:27,606
l saw Brooke standing over his body...

1310
01:23:28,518 --> 01:23:30,349
drenched in his blood.

1311
01:23:37,026 --> 01:23:39,153
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?

1312
01:23:39,495 --> 01:23:41,360
No. She'd stashed it by then.

1313
01:23:41,564 --> 01:23:43,498
Move to strike that from the record, Your Honor.

1314
01:23:43,633 --> 01:23:45,123
-it's speculation. -So stricken.

1315
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:49,436
Go ahead.

1316
01:23:54,344 --> 01:23:57,245
Miss Windham, did you hear a shot fired?

1317
01:23:57,714 --> 01:23:59,477
No. l was in the shower.

1318
01:24:02,685 --> 01:24:05,848
So, sometime in the 20 minutes...

1319
01:24:06,155 --> 01:24:09,420
that you were in the shower, your father was shot.

1320
01:24:10,493 --> 01:24:11,721
l guess.

1321
01:24:13,029 --> 01:24:15,156
Your father was shot while you were in the shower...

1322
01:24:16,366 --> 01:24:18,834
but you didn't hear the shot because...

1323
01:24:19,602 --> 01:24:25,199
because you were in the shower?

1324
01:24:28,144 --> 01:24:29,611
l was washing my hair.

1325
01:24:33,483 --> 01:24:35,075
Where is she going with this?

1326
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:37,045
Have a little faith, Gerard.

1327
01:24:45,561 --> 01:24:46,789
Miss Windham...

1328
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:49,160
what had you done earlier that day?

1329
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:51,390
l got up...

1330
01:24:51,768 --> 01:24:54,032
got a latte, went to the gym...

1331
01:24:54,337 --> 01:24:55,736
got a perm, and came home.

1332
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,168
Where you got in the shower?

1333
01:25:01,577 --> 01:25:03,511
l believe the witness has made it clear...

1334
01:25:03,613 --> 01:25:05,604
that she was in the shower.

1335
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:12,948
Yes, Your Honor.

1336
01:25:13,723 --> 01:25:17,124
Miss Windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?

1337
01:25:19,295 --> 01:25:20,887
How many would you say?

1338
01:25:21,798 --> 01:25:23,789
Two a year since l was 1 2.

1339
01:25:24,967 --> 01:25:26,161
You do the math.

1340
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:30,196
A girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

1341
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,207
We all tried to talk her out of it.

1342
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:33,808
Curls weren't a good look for her.

1343
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:35,877
She didn't have your bone structure.

1344
01:25:37,447 --> 01:25:39,415
But, thankfully, that same day...

1345
01:25:39,582 --> 01:25:41,573
she entered the Beta Delta Pi wett-shirt contest...

1346
01:25:41,684 --> 01:25:43,811
where she was completely hosed down from head to toe.

1347
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,821
Objection! Why is this relevant?

1348
01:25:47,223 --> 01:25:48,451
l have a point, l promise.

1349
01:25:48,724 --> 01:25:49,918
Then make it.

1350
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:51,827
Yes, ma'am.

1351
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:55,656
Chutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's curls ruined...

1352
01:25:55,765 --> 01:25:57,130
when she got hosed down?

1353
01:25:58,768 --> 01:26:00,030
Because they got wet?

1354
01:26:00,136 --> 01:26:02,297
Exactly. isn't it the first cardinal rule...

1355
01:26:02,405 --> 01:26:04,873
of perm maintenance that you're forbidden to wet your hair...

1356
01:26:05,007 --> 01:26:06,372
for at least 24 hours after getting a perm...

1357
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:09,340
at the risk of deactivating the ammonium thioglycolate?

1358
01:26:11,547 --> 01:26:14,516
And wouldn't somebody who's had, say,30 perms...

1359
01:26:14,617 --> 01:26:17,245
in their life be well aware of this rule?

1360
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,754
And if in fact you weren't washing your hair...

1361
01:26:19,856 --> 01:26:22,188
as l suspect, because your curls are still intact...

1362
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:24,054
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

1363
01:26:24,193 --> 01:26:25,922
And if in fact you had heard the gunshot...

1364
01:26:26,028 --> 01:26:27,996
Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun...

1365
01:26:28,097 --> 01:26:29,689
before you got downstairs...

1366
01:26:29,832 --> 01:26:31,891
which would mean you would have had to have found...

1367
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:33,764
Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand...

1368
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:36,430
to make your story plausible. lsn't that right?

1369
01:26:36,572 --> 01:26:38,767
She's my age! Did she tell you that?

1370
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:41,469
How would you feel if your father married someone your age?

1371
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:43,135
You, however, had time to hide the gun...

1372
01:26:43,246 --> 01:26:45,407
after you shot your father.

1373
01:26:45,515 --> 01:26:46,607
l didn't mean to shoot him.

1374
01:26:46,883 --> 01:26:48,942
l thought it was you walking through the door!

1375
01:26:52,321 --> 01:26:53,720
Order! Order!

1376
01:26:54,824 --> 01:26:55,791
Order!

1377
01:26:56,025 --> 01:26:58,186
Oh, my God.

1378
01:26:58,828 --> 01:26:59,920
Oh, my God.

1379
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:01,496
Oh, my God.

1380
01:27:03,366 --> 01:27:05,425
Bailiff, take the witness into custody...

1381
01:27:05,535 --> 01:27:08,902
where she will be charged for the murder of Heyworth Windham.

1382
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:11,662
in the matter of The State vs. Brooke Windham...

1383
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:13,975
this case is dismissed.

1384
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:16,269
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

1385
01:27:28,324 --> 01:27:29,291
Thank you!

1386
01:27:33,963 --> 01:27:35,590
Elle, how did you know Chutney was lying?

1387
01:27:35,765 --> 01:27:37,232
Because she's brilliant, of course.

1388
01:27:37,366 --> 01:27:39,163
The rules of hair care are simple and finite.

1389
01:27:39,368 --> 01:27:40,858
Any Cosmo Girl would have known.

1390
01:27:43,906 --> 01:27:47,433
What?

1391
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:49,605
l just wanted to say...

1392
01:27:49,712 --> 01:27:52,112
that you were so brilliant in there.

1393
01:27:53,549 --> 01:27:55,881
And that l was wrong.

1394
01:27:57,219 --> 01:28:00,450
And you are the girl for me.

1395
01:28:02,024 --> 01:28:03,252
Really?

1396
01:28:04,093 --> 01:28:07,119
Pooh bear...l love you.

1397
01:28:09,532 --> 01:28:13,366
l've waited so long to hear you say that.

1398
01:28:15,972 --> 01:28:18,668
But if l'm gonna be a partner at a law firm by the time l'm 30...

1399
01:28:18,808 --> 01:28:21,106
l need a boyfriend who's not such a complete bonehead.

1400
01:28:26,349 --> 01:28:27,338
Thank you, boys.

1401
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:35,689
Ladies and gentlemen...

1402
01:28:35,891 --> 01:28:39,327
l present the graduates of Harvard Law School...

1403
01:28:39,895 --> 01:28:42,056
Class of 2004.

1404
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,528
l am personally very honored to introduce...

1405
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:50,128
this year's class-elected speaker.

1406
01:28:51,007 --> 01:28:54,204
After getting off to a quite interesting start...

1407
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:55,675
here at Harvard...

1408
01:28:55,811 --> 01:28:58,974
she graduates today with an invitation to join...

1409
01:28:59,115 --> 01:29:02,141
one of Boston's most prestigious law firms.

1410
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:06,720
l'm sure we are going to see great things from her.

1411
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:11,558
Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.

1412
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:34,974
On our very first day at Harvard...

1413
01:29:35,117 --> 01:29:37,312
a very wise professor quoted Aristotle.

1414
01:29:38,988 --> 01:29:41,218
The law is reason free from passion.

1415
01:29:42,658 --> 01:29:45,286
Well, no offense to Aristotle...

1416
01:29:45,494 --> 01:29:47,189
but in my three years at Harvard...

1417
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:50,560
l have come to find that passion is a key ingredient...

1418
01:29:50,866 --> 01:29:54,734
to the study and practice of law and of life.

1419
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:58,467
it is with passion, courage of conviction...

1420
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:00,232
and strong sense of self...

1421
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:02,577
that we take our next steps into the world...

1422
01:30:03,546 --> 01:30:05,207
remembering that first impressions...

1423
01:30:05,314 --> 01:30:06,679
are not always correct...

1424
01:30:08,718 --> 01:30:10,743
you must always have faith in people...

1425
01:30:11,921 --> 01:30:13,445
and most importantly...

1426
01:30:16,759 --> 01:30:19,159
you must always have faith in yourself.

1427
01:30:21,363 --> 01:30:23,991
Congratulations, Class of 2004.

1428
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,695
We did it!
