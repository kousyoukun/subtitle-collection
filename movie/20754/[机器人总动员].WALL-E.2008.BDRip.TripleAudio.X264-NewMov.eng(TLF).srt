01:32:58,672 --> 01:33:01,038
# Like the fish in the ocean #

1344
01:33:02,576 --> 01:33:04,806
# We felt at home in the sea #

1345
01:33:06,613 --> 01:33:09,275
# We learned to live off the good land #

1346
01:33:10,684 --> 01:33:12,914
# We learned to climb up a tree #

1347
01:33:14,721 --> 01:33:17,281
# Then we got up on two legs #

1348
01:33:18,992 --> 01:33:21,517
# But we wanted to fly #

1349
01:33:22,896 --> 01:33:25,592
# And when we messed up
our homeland #

1350
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,528
# We set sail for the sky #

1351

# We're coming down to the ground #

1352

# There's no better place to go #

1353
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:39,771
# We got snow up on the mountains #

1354
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,280
# We got rivers down below #

1355

# We're coming down to the ground #

1356
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:48,847

1357
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:51,823
# And the land will be looked after #

1358
01:33:51,925 --> 01:33:54,416
# We'll send the seeds
out in the breeze #
