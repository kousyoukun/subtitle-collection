1
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:27,146
This is the Hungfa temple outside
the frontier

2
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,275
lt's a cold winter night

3
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:33,881
The top 28 fighters of the boxer world...

4
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:36,983
are here to eliminate a evil boxer

5
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:38,755
They're waging...

6
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:41,354
a world-shaking battle against him

7
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:44,529
No one knows the name of the demon

8
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:47,161
No one ever sees his face too

9
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:50,969
He always cover his face
with a black and white mask

10
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:53,943
His nickname is ''Bat without Wings''

11
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:57,147
lt's said that he's a lustful.
horny man...

12
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:59,775
who has raped and killed many women

13
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:02,912
So the righteous boxers united together

14
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:06,048
...and chased him to the Hungfa temple

15
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:07,819
waging a dead-or-alive battle against him

16
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,587
Unfortunately.

17
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,858
only two boxers survived at last

18
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,526
...and he killed 26 boxers

19
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:17,363

Then your shop?

81
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:23,391
The shop didn't belong to me

82
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:27,266
l just killed the shop owner

83

...and used it for one day

84
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:30,631
One day?

00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:44,446
Are you using the name of Xiao Qi...

89
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:45,955
intentionally to lure me here?

90
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:48,119
You're smart

91
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,055
That's correct

92
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,630
l deceived you into coming here

93
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:56,427
...because l want you to stay here forever

94
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,230
lt's not as easy as you think

95
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,464
My people knew that l came here

96
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:01,835
They'll come here to look for me

97
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:02,965
Your people?

98
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:07,747
l'm afraid they can't come here

99
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:13,112
Unless you go to look for them

100
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:14,351
Why?

101
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:21,593
Because the road to hell is always
of no return

102
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,687
You want to see them...

103
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:26,392
unless you go to hell too

104
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,159
Quite an impressive swordplay!

105
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:02,064
What the hell is this place?

106
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:07,038
Anyone here?

107
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,607
Come out now

Who are you?

109

lt seems that l'm the owner of this place

110
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,164
Right

111
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:40,167
l'm their owner as well

112
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,875
But l've strangled them to death

113
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:51,249
These are the breasts of Long Yu

114
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,652
This is Li Fang

115
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,128

l carve using them as models

119
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,841
Can't draw out their true beauty however!

120
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,374
Bat without Wings

121
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,441
What are you talking about?

122
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,505
l said you're the Bat without Wings

123
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,211
You're still alive

124

5 years ago. people said your death
is faked

125
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,416
The Bat without Wings?

126
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,886
The name sounds familiar

127
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:29,892
Who are you?

128
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:33,631
How do you know this name?

129
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,271

131
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:39,306
Don't come

132
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:42,173
Who is she?

133
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:46,545
Come on. Tell me who she is?

134
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,948
Who is it? Come out now

135
00:10:58,595 --> 00:10:59,756

138
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,855
What's the matter?

139
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:31,093
Feeling dazzled?

140
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,962
How do you know?

141
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,832
Because you drank...

142
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,998
the poisonous wine

143
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,966
l don't know you

144
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,067
l've nothing to do with you

145
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:46,738
Why did you lure me here?

146
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,337
Right

147
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,248
You've nothing to do with me

148
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:54,379
But you look like somebody

149

Do you want me to strip her clothes off...

158
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,540
in order to refresh your memory?

159
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:15,611
No

160
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,405

Open the door

175
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:34,955
Open the door...

176
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,132
Qiuju. what's the matter?

177
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,257
Where's the master?

178
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:38,925
What's the matter?

179
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,263
Master. something happens

180
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:42,637
Something dreadful happened!

181
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,070
The men of the security bureau...

182
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:46,768
were all killed in the Maple Wood

183
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,639
What? All killed?

184
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:50,543
What are you talking about?

185
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:54,311
Mr. Chen. the escort boxers were
all killed

186
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,283
Where's the lady?...

187
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:57,877
Tell me now

188
00:13:57,988 --> 00:13:59,182
Hanshen...

189
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:00,649
Feng-erh is indeed your fiancee

190
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,351
But you need to be patient

191
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:03,689
...and tell us clearly

192
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,194
Qiuju. where's Feng-erh?

193
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,493
The lady got a letter from
Mr. Xiao Qi and went to

194
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,569
...the Tianlung Temple outside Maple Wood

195
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,069
l never saw her again

196
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,331
Mr. Xiao Qi?

197
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,732
How did Feng-erh know Xiao Qi?

198
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:20,171
Did Xiao kill the boxers?

199
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,268
No

200
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,679
The killer was a very horrible person

201
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,149
He's called the Bat without Wings

202
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:28,585
What? The Bat without Wings!

203
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,154
Could you be mistaken?

204
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:32,418
He died five years ago

205
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:33,493
How could he kill people?

206
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:35,061
He called himself the Bat without Wings

207
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:37,130
l did see him killing the boxers

208
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:38,657
No more bullshit about him anymore

209
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,562
Bring my sword here

210
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,134
Hurry to the temple now

211
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:42,601
Hurry up

212
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:43,803
Master...

213
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:46,164
Xiao wasn't at the temple

214
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:47,002
How do you know?

215
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,632
This morning someone said he had...

216
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:50,301
gone to Taibai restaurant in the east
of the town

217
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,708
He's expecting a friend

218
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:52,609
Taibai restaurant?

219
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:54,808
Stop arguing please...

220
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,680
l'm sorry

221
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,014
The whole restaurant...

222
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,951
is reserved by someone

223
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:04,349
Excuse me...

224
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,593
Take a look over the place

225
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:12,633
Yes

226
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,363
Mr. Xiao...

227
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:15,870
You've finally come

228
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:19,440
Shangguan Wangsun.
the wealthiest man in the south

229
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,375
Why are you looking for me eagerly?

230
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,180
Please take a look

231
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,784
This is the assassination order...

232
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,581
from the Hell Gang

233
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:33,715
lt asks to kill you at 1st hour
of Chongyang Festival

234
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:35,753
Today is Chongyang Festival

235
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,228
lt's the time now

236
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,699
Quick. Put it down

237
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:47,832
Hurry up...

238
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:50,205
These are the precious jewelry and jade

239
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,244
l hope you will take them. Mr. Xiao

240
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:00,918
The Hell Gang!

241
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,943
So you're hiding here. Go!

242
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:23,772
Yes

243
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:30,182
l didn't expect there're 4 extra punks...

244
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:31,514
in the menu of Taibai restaurant

245
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:34,989
Also l didn't expect that...

246
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,888
l need to kill someone else
besides Shangguan

247
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:49,637
Who are you?

248
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:58,305
Jewelry Sword and White Gown

249
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,280
Xiao Qi?

250
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,215
Shangguan had nothing to do with you

251
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,718
Besides. he is famous for his kindness

252
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,718
Why do you need to kill him?

253
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,556
The Hell Gang makes a living
by killing people

254
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,321
Mr. Xiao. you'd better stay away
from my business

255
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,417
Okay

256
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,258
Then you leave here now

257
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,662
Do you mean if we leave here now...

258
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,429
you'll stay away from our business
with Shangguan?

259
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,502
Mr. Xiao. you...

260
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:20,231
The money from you only...

261
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,570
guarantees your safety
in this restaurant...

262
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,371
but not in other places

263
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,341
So...

264
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,207
Okay

265
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,541
We're leaving here now

266
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,409
Wait

267
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,511
You didn't listen to my words clearly

268
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,084
What is it?

269
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,676
l mean you may leave here

270
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,255
...unless you left your life

271
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:42,954
Thanks for saving me. Mr. Xiao

272
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:43,858
Not at all

273
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:45,455
Mr. Shangguan.

274
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:47,191
can l ask you a favor?

275
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,233
Sure...

276
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:52,464
l heard there's serious flooding
in Jiangnan

277
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:55,132
Please take the jewels to help the victims

278
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:55,970
ls it okay?

279
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,470
But it belongs to you

280
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:01,274
l saved you today only
because you're a good man

281
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,009
...but not because you're wealthy

282
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,084
Excuse me...

283
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:05,610
Sorry for the trouble

284
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,745
Carry the stuff away

285
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,822
Yes

286
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:26,440
Goodbye

287
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,839
Okay

288
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:33,742
Pal...

289
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,444
You've been here for 2 hours

290
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:37,451
why do you still keep hiding?

291
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,022
Who are you?

292
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:46,862
l was the one who hired the Ghost King...

293
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:49,660
to kill Shangguan

294
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:52,966
l've something very important to do

295
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,162
l need a favor from you

296
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:56,440
But l want someone...

297
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,509
who is a real expert

298
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,909
So you sent the Ghost King to test me

299
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:05,813
Right. lf you couldn't kill
the Ghost King.

300
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,316
you wouldn't be able to kill
Bat without Wings

301
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:09,254
He is still alive?

302
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,721
l bet you know what happened at...

303
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:15,885
Hungfa temple in Mount Wudang 5 years ago

304
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:20,430
lt's said he did die that day

305
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,525
There is such rumor in the boxer world

306
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:23,967
But my father took...

307
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,733
the Bat Blades to the frontier

308
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,068
and he never returned

309
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:30,770
The Bat is the only one...

310
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:33,403
who wants my father dead for revenge

311
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:34,777
Your father is...

312
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:38,381
Szma Zhongyuan of Szma Villa

313
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,344
So you're Szma Dongcheng

314
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,889
People always talked about you
a few years ago

315
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:46,517
l'm here to ask you to find out...

316
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:47,960
where my father is

317
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:51,231
ln other words.

318
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,028
l want to know if the Bat is really dead

319
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:58,269
Many people are here today

320
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,240
Are you looking for me too?

321
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,742
You're wrong this time

322
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,540
We're looking for Miss Szma

323
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,209
l don't know you guys

324
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:06,941
You're...

325
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,848
Venomous Wuxie. the Stun-dude

326
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:13,185
l'm the poisonous Dr. Wang Wuxie

327
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,986
l'm the grim & bewitching Xu Fang

328
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:18,362
Another 2 excellent assassins are here

329
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:20,960
Did someone hire you to kill me?

330
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,054
No

331
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,267
There's a big secret in the boxer world

332
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,931
One of the Bat Blades is in your hands

333
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,235
So someone hired us...

334
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:31,366
to rob it from you

335
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:32,875
Didn't you hear...

336
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,606
my father and the blade were missing
in the frontier

337
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:41,177
Who will believe you?

338
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:43,681
l will

339
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:45,718
Miss Szma

340
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:47,656
l'll do as you request

341
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,284
You may leave now

342
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,625
Really?

343
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:52,426

At the Maple Wood. my boxers...

the Bat without Wings

But before he killed my men.

374

he gave a letter to my daughter

Actually l myself have come here

l didn't ask your daughter to see me here

This is a check with my handwriting

386

The handwriting of his name is different

387
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,473
lt must be the Bat deceiving...

l heard that the Bat died 5 years ago

392

in the Maple Wood

516
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:21,666
What?

517
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:24,108
Sir. where did you go?

518
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:25,611
l was looking for the Bat for revenge

519
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:27,838
Do you know where's he?

520
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:28,438
l don't know

521
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,777
l heard of the duel at the frontier
that year

522
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,614
26 boxers were killed by the Bat

523
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,747
Only the lron Palm.
Szma Zhongyuan and the...

524
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:37,826
thousand-faced Scholar.
Leng Qiuyun were alive

525
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:42,853
Szma was missing at the frontier lately

526
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:46,493
So Leng Qiuyun is the only one left

527
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,838
l'm going to see Leng now

528
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,348
Strange! Why're there many people
here tonight?

529
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,687
Hold it

530
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:05,688
These people are dead

531
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,654
What?

532
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:27,274
They're really dead people

533
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,438
The Bat knew we will pass here

534
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,039
if we're looking for Mr. Leng

535
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,549
He's giving us a warning here

536
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:34,050
Look

537
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,049
Wang Wuxie. Xu Fang

538
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,066
They're the top killers

539
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:54,368
Only few boxers can tackle them

540
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:57,377
You're right

541
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:06,015
Who is it?

542
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:09,552
Who's hiding here?

543
00:34:09,658 --> 00:34:11,023
Come out...

544
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:14,628
No one is speaking here at all

545
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,425
The one who speaks has been here already

546
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:22,271
Well. who's really dead?

547
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,669
Who's faking to be dead?

548
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:25,139
lt's clear now

549
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:27,477
How could you know they're speaking?

550
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:30,513
Many people know ventriloquism

551
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:32,708
Their lips don't need to move
when speaking

552
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:36,480
No wonder you're famous in the boxer world

553
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:38,584
But it's pity you like to
meddle in affairs

554
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:52,030
You want to see my lifting skills

555
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:53,934
They forced us to the river bank
on purpose

556
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:54,869
Right

557
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:57,067
My nickname is the Venomous Wuxie

558
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:59,304
ln the pond l've put...

559
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:01,573
the most poisonous drug of...

560
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:04,373
our Tang School

561
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:07,317
Once you touch the water.

562
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,889
your whole body will be swollen to death

563
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:39,314
There's nothing in the pond.
Not even a leaf

564
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:41,788
You've nowhere to stand on

565
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,381
and you're surely dead

566
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:32,975
lt looks as if they knew...

567
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,137
we're looking for thousand-faced Scholar

568
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:35,744
Let's hurry for the Leng's Garden now

569
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,198
Look

570
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:58,205
''Spiritual Tablet of Leng Qiuyun''

571
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,501
How could he be dead as well?

572
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,075
Once again their moves proved to be faster

573
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:03,275
We're late

574
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:04,845
Right

575
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,213
You're late

576
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,346
Unfortunately my lord suddenly
died of a disease...

577
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:15,117
3 days ago

578
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:21,895
He didn't have many friends
when he's alive

579
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:26,402
But when he died.
many came looking for him

580
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:29,961
Seems like there's more than
one dead person here

581
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,399
Why are there so many dead people?

582
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:36,071
How do you know they're dead?

583
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:40,710
Stop

584
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:49,290
Please stop

585
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:54,799
Are you the Broken-heart Sword Xiao Qi?

586
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,527
Yes. l am

587
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:59,697
So you're not from the Bat's gang

588
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:02,032
We're here to look for the Bat

589
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:03,376
Why?

590
00:38:03,477 --> 00:38:06,674
Because his daughter was killed by the Bat

591
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,748
He seeks the Bat for revenge

592
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:11,241
But we're late

593
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:14,219
l never expected Mr. Leng to be dead

594
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,014
The people here are strange...

595
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,649
just like them

596
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,196
Those who should have died
are still alive!

597
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:26,761
Do you want to see Leng Qiuyun?

598
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:27,927
Follow me

599
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,058
Old sir. are you bringing us
to see Mr. Leng?

600
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,065
Where's he now?

601
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,331
He's here

602
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,599
ln fact l wasn't dead

603
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,670
l just try to defend myself against
the Bat

604
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,806
So l pretended that l was dead

605
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,942
You do believe that the Bat is
still alive?

606
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,417
Yes

607
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:18,655
Because the Bat didn't die at all

608
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:20,225
He got hit in the forehead...

609
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:22,521
by the lron Palm of Mr. Szma...

610
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:23,925
and fainted

611
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:25,662
He became insane...

612
00:39:25,765 --> 00:39:28,529
after he gaining consciousness

613
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:29,999
He didn't remember anything

614
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,364
To maintain peace amongst people...

615
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:36,375
we announced that he's dead

616
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:39,776
ln fact we locked him on the Bamboo lsland

617
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,938
Bamboo lsland?

618
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:41,810
Right

619
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:45,646
lt's an isolated island

620
00:39:45,754 --> 00:39:47,847
lt's very close to the Szma Villa

621
00:39:47,956 --> 00:39:51,084
Szma is an expert in setting up the traps

622
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:53,956
He sets up traps and land mines
on the island

623
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:56,189
Even a expert fighter...

624
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:58,198
can't get there easily

625
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,731
l really don't understand

626
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:02,326
He's a mad man

627
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:04,030
How could he possibly escape?

628
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,233
How can you be sure that it must be him?

629
00:40:06,742 --> 00:40:08,141
lf it wasn't him.

630
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:10,645
who can kill Szma Zhongyuan?

631
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:13,181
Who stole the Bat Blades of
Szma Dongcheng?

632
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:16,116
You say. the blade which
Szma Dongcheng lost...

633
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,311
is the Bat Blade

634
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:18,911
Right

635
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:21,081
l believe it's that Bat Blade

636
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:23,621
lt's said that there're a pair
of Bat Blades

637
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:25,696
The Bat carried them wherever he went

638
00:40:25,797 --> 00:40:26,889
That's the treasure that...

639
00:40:26,998 --> 00:40:28,727
many boxers want to have it

640
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,960
How could Dongcheng get it?

641
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,898
lt's a long story

642
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:36,798
You probably knew that...

643
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:40,538
the Bat has kidnapped many pretty women

644
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,204
He raped and then killed them

645
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,508
Among those hundreds of victims.

646
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,676
there're only 2 exceptions

647
00:40:47,786 --> 00:40:49,880
l heard that these 2 women...

648
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,457
too pretty to be spared

649
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,424
The Bat let them go...

650
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:57,519
and gave away his blades to both of them

651
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:02,859
One of them is Szma Dongcheng

652
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:05,299
Who is the other one?

653
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:14,708
Lei-feng

654
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:16,044
lt's not Lei-feng

655
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:17,345
lt's my fiancee

656
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:21,254
No one knows this secret

657
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,457
lt's because of her

658
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:25,583
l risked my life fighting against the Bat

659
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:26,993
Strange!

660
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:28,927
She looks like my daughter

661
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:31,391
Maybe that's why...

662
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:34,026
the Bat kidnapped your daughter

663
00:41:34,804 --> 00:41:36,271
Where's she now?

664
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:37,430
Sorry

665
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,734
For her safety.

666
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,604
l cannot tell you

667
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:42,303
Why?

668
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:44,937
l heard that there's a big secret...

669
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:47,380
regarding these two Bat Blades

670
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:50,783
Now Miss Szma has lost her blade.
l'm afraid...

671
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:53,356
someone has got plans for her blade

672
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:55,283
Fine

673
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,191
Anyway. we're looking for the Bat only

674
00:41:58,296 --> 00:42:00,457
lt would be better if you keep silent

675
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:02,294
l don't want any misunderstanding

676
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,527
Well. we shouldn't have disturbed you

677
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:07,571
Thanks for your information

678
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:09,106
Goodbye

679
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:11,339
See you

680
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:12,603
You go ahead in this direction

681
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:15,043
Passing Lingding lsle.
you'll see Bamboo lsland

682
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:15,002
We saw a road here a moment ago

683
00:43:15,112 --> 00:43:16,602
Why are there bamboos
blocking the road here?

684
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:19,376
Right. l feel like when we're
making our way.

685
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:20,745
the bamboo is moving with us
at the same time

686
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:21,909
Right

687
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:23,680
The bamboo is moving along

688
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:24,549
What?

689
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:28,018
Have you heard of the Taoist magic?

690
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:30,219
Yeah sure

691
00:43:30,328 --> 00:43:32,091
There're few people in the boxer world...

692
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:33,323
knowing the tricks

693
00:43:33,832 --> 00:43:36,824
Probably Szma Zhongyuan is one of them

694
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:38,562
What is Taoist magic?

695
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,865
lt's the same as a trap

696
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:41,564
But it's very crafty

697
00:43:41,674 --> 00:43:43,073
lt combines the tricks of Taoist magic...

698
00:43:43,175 --> 00:43:44,699
with mechanical switchboards.

699
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,244
producing many forms of traps...

700
00:43:47,346 --> 00:43:48,870
locking people inside

701
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:50,278
Like now for instance

702
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:52,614
lt seems as if we're close to the balcony

703
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:54,653
But no matter how hard we try

704
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:56,222
we couldn't prop the boat across

705
00:43:56,723 --> 00:43:58,850
The traps under the water...

706
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:00,324
and the bamboos...

707
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:02,054
will block our way automatically

708
00:44:19,214 --> 00:44:19,908
No wonder Szma Zhongyuan managed...

709
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,642
to lock the Bat here

710
00:44:22,317 --> 00:44:23,011
Look!

711
00:44:31,928 --> 00:44:32,758
The Bat without Wings

712
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:39,362
Szma Zhongyuan is really good

713
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,198
He's helped us to cross the water

714
00:44:42,172 --> 00:44:44,003
lf anyone tried to rescue the Bat.

715
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:45,575
he'd be surely dead

716
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:47,803
What should we do?

717
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,071
Get to the shore first

718
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:53,309
How could we?

719
00:44:53,918 --> 00:44:56,113
Taoist magic is beyond our understanding

720
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,018
lt seems to know everything

721
00:44:58,123 --> 00:45:00,318
There's only one way to break it

722
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:02,393
And that's to go against it

723
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:04,894
We go that way if we want to go
to the balcony

724
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:07,726
Come on

725
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:00,715
There're traps everywhere

726
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,630
ls he the Bat without Wings?

727
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,531
Look at the chains. He's probably the Bat

728
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,264
No

729
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,308
He doesn't look like the one in Maple Wood

730
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:25,613
Let's take a look there

731
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:53,503
The water is toxic

732
00:46:54,347 --> 00:46:56,111
Many people must have died here

733
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:11,590
Dead without permission

734
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,232
lt's made of iron

735
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:22,044
Guess we should climb up the bamboo

736
00:47:22,144 --> 00:47:23,076
...to get there like we do before

737
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:24,807
l think it's the only way out

738
00:47:41,398 --> 00:47:42,558
We're trapped again

739
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:43,462
Surely we are. because...

740
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:45,865
the traps are moving under the water again

741
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:19,495
Who are you?

742
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,971
Don't you know who l am?

743
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:26,709
l'm the Bat without Wings

744
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:29,213
Why did you kill my daughter?

745
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:51,570
Where's he?

746
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:53,608
l saw someone throwing darts at us

747
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,309
But there's no way outta here

748
00:49:05,755 --> 00:49:07,587
Strange! Where did the people go?

749
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:06,509
lt's a nice house

750
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:07,643
Who owns it?

751
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:16,718
Who are you. sir?

752
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:19,890
You enter Szma Villa without informing

753
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:22,435
Do you have something important?

754
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:24,595
Szma Villa?

755
00:51:24,705 --> 00:51:26,002
Yes

756
00:51:27,241 --> 00:51:30,905
This is my house

757
00:51:31,012 --> 00:51:34,971
Mr. Xiao and Mr. Lei

758
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,550
Why did you come out over there?

759
00:51:36,985 --> 00:51:39,510
We tried to catch the Bat on Bamboo lsland

760
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:42,283
But he escaped through a tunnel
in a small house

761
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,120
We went after him...

762
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:44,988
but unexpectedly turned up here

763
00:51:45,094 --> 00:51:47,119
Really?

764
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,691
So what. the Bat isn't dead?

765
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:50,822
Right

766
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:52,730
The Bat without Wings didn't die

767
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:54,097
The traps on the Bamboo lsland...

768
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:56,171
were set up by our master...

769
00:51:56,273 --> 00:51:58,207
to imprison the Bat

770
00:51:58,575 --> 00:52:00,475
For our convenience to look after
that idiot

771
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:02,568
...he made this underground tunnel

772
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:05,803
No matter what

773
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,248
Since you gentlemen are here

774
00:52:08,351 --> 00:52:10,217
Please let me serve you with wine

775
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:11,948
Hope you'll have a good stay here

776
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:18,892
Please

777
00:52:18,996 --> 00:52:19,655
Thanks

778
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:24,567
Oh!

779
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,695
Mr. Lei. how do you suddenly find out...

780
00:52:26,805 --> 00:52:28,534
the Bat is on the island?

781
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,871
Mr. Leng Qiuyun told us

782
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:33,410
lf l guess right.

783
00:52:33,512 --> 00:52:34,877
the Bat has already escaped...

784
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,209
from the island

785
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:38,910
Because l just saw it's another one there

786
00:52:39,018 --> 00:52:39,916
Really?

787
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,885
lt may have connection to...

788
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:45,116
my father's death at the frontier

789
00:52:45,525 --> 00:52:46,389
Anyway...

790
00:52:46,492 --> 00:52:48,119
it's already dark now

791
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:50,322
Please stay here for a night...

792
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:51,523
and leave tomorrow

793
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:09,312
Sleep late to enjoy the moonlight

794
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:10,975
Rise early to tend to flowers

795
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:14,419
lt's late. Why don't you go to bed.
Miss Szma?

796
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,923
ls it because of your fondness
of the moon?

797
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:17,924
No

798
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:21,658
lt's quiet in the villa

799
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:23,664
Since my father left.

800
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:26,132
no one ever visited us

801
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,696
So whenever there's a full moon.

802
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,968
l'm always here to think about the past

803
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,508
Still missing Hero Linghu?

804
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,908
You know our relationship?

805
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,140
Everyone in the boxer world knows...

806
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,776
...you're a perfect match

807
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:45,151
Unfortunately. the Bat abducted you

808
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:47,156
Hero Linghu tried to save you...

809
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,419
and went to the frontier

810
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:51,256
But he's killed by that madman

811
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,331
Linghu Tian and my father went
to the frontier...

812
00:53:54,433 --> 00:53:56,162
it wasn't because of me

813
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:57,701
Because he believed...

814
00:53:57,803 --> 00:53:59,327
the Bat never hurt me

815
00:54:00,673 --> 00:54:02,504
The reason l accompanied your father

816
00:54:02,608 --> 00:54:04,405
was because your father told me...

817
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,345
the Bat kept two kungfu manuals

818
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:11,679
lf l couldn't destroy them. it'd be a...

819
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:14,185
disaster for the martial world

820
00:54:15,021 --> 00:54:17,182
But there are already 7 people

821
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,552
Why did you have to go?

822
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,188
Dongcheng...

823
00:54:21,295 --> 00:54:23,786
A great man should plan and worry ahead

824
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:25,923
and enjoy the fruits after the people

825
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,661
How can l let the other folk alone?

826
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:33,004
Promise me you must come back

827
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:34,406
l'll come back

828
00:54:35,477 --> 00:54:37,570
He said he'll be back

829
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:40,477
But he didn't

830
00:54:42,684 --> 00:54:45,050
He wants to look for the manuals

831
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:47,054
But l couldn't fulfill his last wish

832
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:50,687
Boxers are always looking for
fame and money

833
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:54,786
Hero Linghu is very exceptional

834
00:54:54,897 --> 00:54:57,695
lt's no doubt whenever there's a full moon

835
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,564
you'll miss him

836
00:55:00,938 --> 00:55:02,997
Well...the night is deep and the fog heavy

837
00:55:03,107 --> 00:55:06,008
l speak too much

838
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:09,273
l think it's already mid-night

839
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,711
You'd better go to bed

840
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:14,109
Tomorrow we bid farewell

841
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:15,686
Please...

842
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:28,900
Mr. Lei...

843
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:30,662
ln the small house on Bamboo lsland
you remember

844
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,465
...there's a pair of stone deer?

845
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:34,471
There's a pair over at
the Tianlung Temple too

846
00:55:34,573 --> 00:55:35,801
Do you think...

847
00:55:35,908 --> 00:55:36,897
they look the same?

848
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:39,176
Now that you remind me

849
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:43,442
Do you mean the deer in the temple

850
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,539
...has the same mechanism?

851
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:47,547
''Tianlung Temple''

852
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:45,709
May l know who is coming?

853
00:56:45,817 --> 00:56:47,307
Please show up

854
00:56:53,225 --> 00:56:55,090
lt looks like...tonight someone
has invited us...

855
00:56:55,193 --> 00:56:57,389
to come here on purpose

856
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,191
Look!

857
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,670
What a big stone statue!

858
00:57:11,879 --> 00:57:12,470
This painting...

859
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:14,843
Didn't we see it in Mr. Leng's house?

860
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:20,720
Could it possibly be that...

861
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:23,086
One of these two statues is Miss Szma

862
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:25,819
Other one is the mysterious lady
Leng mentioned

863
00:57:26,427 --> 00:57:27,553
Possibly

864
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:30,563
lt must be the home of the Bat

865
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,234
Who's the mysterious woman in yellow?

866
00:57:35,737 --> 00:57:37,262
lf we can locate her.

867
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:38,931
we may find out the Bat...

868
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:39,939
and his secret

869
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:42,369
lf this is the home of the Bat.

870
00:57:42,478 --> 00:57:43,570
he must bring all the girls...

871
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,907
back to here

872
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:45,844
Let's check the place out

873
00:57:45,948 --> 00:57:47,347
We may find some clues

874
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:48,108
Right

875
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:02,694
Come and take a look

876
00:58:03,367 --> 00:58:04,527
Lei-feng wore this the other day

877
00:58:04,635 --> 00:58:05,226
Am l right?

878
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:06,500
Right

879
00:58:06,604 --> 00:58:08,128
Her mother embroidered the edge for her

880
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,507
l think when she died...

881
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:11,939
she was tied up here

882
00:58:13,945 --> 00:58:14,809
Look!

883
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,273
This was Lei-feng's handwriting

884
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:20,641
Probably she wrote it before she died

885
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,385
Ximen

886
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:24,813
What Ximen?

887
00:58:24,923 --> 00:58:27,687
Could it be Ximen Luoye?

888
00:58:28,962 --> 00:58:30,691
Ximen Luoye

889
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:33,989
Mr. Lei. how do you know?

890
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,931
There are 2 pretty women
in the martial world

891
00:58:36,035 --> 00:58:38,060
One is Szma Dongzheng

892
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:39,604
The other one is Ximen Luoye

893
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:42,100
Ximen family is very reputed
in boxer world

894
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:43,335
They've very strict discipline

895
00:58:43,444 --> 00:58:45,674
No one ever saw her

896
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:47,371
Do you know where she is now?

897
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:50,507
The aristocratic Ximen family
was withered...

898
00:58:50,618 --> 00:58:51,915
and completely declined

899
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:53,145
lt has lost its glamour

900
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,889
l heard Miss Ximen stays in
Shiau Shiang house

901
00:58:56,992 --> 00:59:00,052
somewhere in the suburbs of Hanzhou

902
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:00,722
''Shiau Shiang House''

903
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,279
Thank you. miss

904
00:59:19,915 --> 00:59:22,476
Xi-erh

905
00:59:22,586 --> 00:59:25,020
Except you. no one talks to me...

906
00:59:25,122 --> 00:59:26,612
all these years

907
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:27,553
lt's not true

908
00:59:29,893 --> 00:59:30,689
Who then?

909
00:59:30,794 --> 00:59:31,590
Me

910
00:59:36,968 --> 00:59:37,935
You?

911
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:40,768
l've not seen you for 5 years

912
00:59:40,872 --> 00:59:45,172
But you're as pretty as before

913
00:59:45,276 --> 00:59:45,970
What are you doing here?

914
00:59:46,077 --> 00:59:48,945
l need the Bat's Blade that you kept

915
00:59:58,824 --> 01:00:00,087
Why did you kill them?

916
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:01,223
To keep their mouths shut

917
01:00:04,064 --> 01:00:05,656
l guessed right

918
01:00:05,765 --> 01:00:07,323
You're not the Bat without Wings

919
01:00:10,036 --> 01:00:13,700
Ms. Ximen is really clever
as the people say

920
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:22,173
lf you don't want to die.

921
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:24,046
hand out the Bat's Blade

922
01:00:24,151 --> 01:00:25,243
But if you kill me.

923
01:00:25,352 --> 01:00:26,445
you will never get the Blade. too

924
01:00:26,922 --> 01:00:27,650
How can you say...

925
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:29,724
l will never get the Blade?

926
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:31,150
Master

927
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,718
We got the Bat Blade

928
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:37,962
Miss Ximen

929
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:40,035
Do you really think l'm here
for the Blade?

930
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,797
lt's just a plot...

931
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:42,802
to lure you out here

932
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,395
My men have already got it

933
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,750
l just lied

934
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:07,889
l asked my guys to do a small trick

935
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:09,398
and you fell into my trap so easily

936
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:11,560
and showed me the Blade

937
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:12,533
You...

938
01:01:19,078 --> 01:01:22,377
You're really beautiful

939
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:25,507
No wonder that madman was fond of you

940
01:01:26,952 --> 01:01:29,921
Stop or l'll kill myself

941
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:31,284
Are you sure?

942
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:33,215
No way

943
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:38,960
Miss Ximen...

944
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:39,997
Go

945
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,194
Miss Ximen...

946
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:51,006
Here

947
01:01:51,112 --> 01:01:52,272
How are you?

948
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:54,539
Don't touch me

949
01:01:56,651 --> 01:01:58,813
l've no hope

950
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:03,049
lf you're here for the Bat Blade.

951
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:05,119
you're late

952
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:05,989
Who has come?

953
01:02:07,296 --> 01:02:08,923
The Bat without Wings

954
01:02:10,032 --> 01:02:11,660
He's taken the Blade away

955
01:02:13,903 --> 01:02:16,565
But the Bat isn't the real one

956
01:02:16,673 --> 01:02:17,332
What?

957
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:20,100
Then who is he?

958
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:28,208
What? Him?

959
01:02:29,587 --> 01:02:31,214
Miss Ximen...

960
01:02:33,257 --> 01:02:34,087
Xiao Qi

961
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:36,022
l never imagined you to be faster than us

962
01:02:36,126 --> 01:02:37,059
C'mon. hand it over

963
01:02:37,762 --> 01:02:39,423
As it is the Blade isn't here since long

964
01:02:39,531 --> 01:02:40,998
We're busy. you search for yourself

965
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,061
Stop

966
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:51,668
Mr. Lei. don't tie up with them

967
01:02:51,777 --> 01:02:52,801
Leave here immediately

968
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:53,606
Yes

969
01:02:58,484 --> 01:02:59,416
Go

970
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:00,109
Chase

971
01:03:06,627 --> 01:03:07,457
Big brother. please

972
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,965
Our plan is successful

973
01:03:27,248 --> 01:03:28,476
lt's lucky that you came in time

974
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,677
or Xiao Qi will discover that...

975
01:03:30,786 --> 01:03:32,515
l pretended dead by holding my breath

976
01:03:32,988 --> 01:03:35,456
Okay. let them fight each other

977
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:37,115
and we may take the advantage
of the result

978
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:33,414
Dad. you're back?

979
01:04:35,689 --> 01:04:36,553
Here's the Blade

980
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,496
ls it the Blade of the Ximen family?

981
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:51,971
lt's strange

982
01:04:52,574 --> 01:04:55,338
Xiao Qi had gone to Ximen's house

983
01:04:56,077 --> 01:04:57,567
They met Leng Qiuyun

984
01:04:57,679 --> 01:04:59,374
Did Leng tell them everything?

985
01:05:00,883 --> 01:05:02,578
l think...

986
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:04,846
Leng is a very mysterious person

987
01:05:05,388 --> 01:05:07,379
Since he's back from the frontier.

988
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,185
he's been avoiding everyone

989
01:05:10,026 --> 01:05:10,720
Right

990
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:12,589
Did Ximen Luoye tell Xiao...

991
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:14,027
who you are?

992
01:05:14,131 --> 01:05:15,120
No

993
01:05:15,232 --> 01:05:16,392
When they went there.

994
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,832
Ximen Luoye had killed herself

995
01:05:18,935 --> 01:05:19,765
Killed herself?

996
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,928
Come on

997
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:23,632
Bring out the other Bat Blade

998
01:05:37,955 --> 01:05:39,924
Dad. both the Blades are here now

999
01:05:40,025 --> 01:05:40,719
Let's find out...

1000
01:05:40,826 --> 01:05:41,952
where the secret is hidden

1001
01:05:44,696 --> 01:05:50,657
Temple. Lung Tian

1002
01:05:54,074 --> 01:05:55,871
Tianlung Temple

1003
01:05:56,843 --> 01:05:57,537
Right

1004
01:05:57,644 --> 01:05:58,668
l'd already guessed their stuff...

1005
01:05:58,778 --> 01:06:00,143
were hidden under the Tianlung Temple

1006
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:01,573
But l searched thoroughly

1007
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:02,773
Still l couldn't find it

1008
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,613
The name of the temple was carved
on the blade

1009
01:06:05,718 --> 01:06:06,708
lt must be inside the temple

1010
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:09,085
Why don't you bring the madman
to help you?

1011
01:06:11,292 --> 01:06:13,089
Right. he could help

1012
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,452
Men

1013
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:20,696
Dad

1014
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:22,497
lf you find the kungfu manuals.

1015
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,401
promise me that you'll destroy it

1016
01:06:24,506 --> 01:06:26,565
l want to fulfill the will of
brother Linghu

1017
01:06:26,675 --> 01:06:27,699
Don't worry

1018
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,800
l tried hard to find the Blades...

1019
01:06:29,911 --> 01:06:31,742
is because of you

1020
01:06:45,796 --> 01:06:47,195
Come on...

1021
01:06:49,867 --> 01:06:52,734
Go...

1022
01:06:56,106 --> 01:06:57,801
Master. here's your clothes

1023
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:00,872
Go...

1024
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,758
Where's the master?

1025
01:07:16,295 --> 01:07:18,388
He took the madman away from the back door

1026
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:19,088
What's the matter?

1027
01:07:19,198 --> 01:07:20,495
Xiao Qi is here suddenly

1028
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:21,065
What?

1029
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:24,365
Miss Szma...

1030
01:07:26,106 --> 01:07:27,869
Mr. Xiao. why are you here...

1031
01:07:27,974 --> 01:07:29,339
at this late hour?

1032
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,301
We're looking for someone in here

1033
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:33,140
Who?

1034
01:07:33,547 --> 01:07:34,980
The Bat without Wings

1035
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:38,645
Ask Szma Zhongyuan out

1036
01:07:38,753 --> 01:07:40,243
Miss Ximen told me everything...

1037
01:07:40,354 --> 01:07:41,616
before she died

1038
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:42,681
She's the only one who knew...

1039
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,348
who is the Bat

1040
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,592
Szma Dongcheng

1041
01:07:45,693 --> 01:07:47,456
Call your dad to compensate
the death of my daughter

1042
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:54,124
Szma Dongcheng

1043
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,703
You're from a reputed boxer family

1044
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:56,634
How could you do this?

1045
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:59,639
l don't think...

1046
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:01,766
it's the right time to discuss this

1047
01:08:38,717 --> 01:08:39,581
Go now

1048
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:20,391
Stop

1049
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:23,063
You probably know...

1050
01:09:23,165 --> 01:09:26,259
how powerful our trap is

1051
01:09:26,368 --> 01:09:29,132
You're now in the middle of the mine trap

1052
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:31,729
All the bamboo around you carry dynamite

1053
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,436
The four strings of this instrument...

1054
01:09:35,545 --> 01:09:38,912
is the lead linked to the trap

1055
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:40,983
lf l just snap the string...

1056
01:09:41,084 --> 01:09:43,314
you'll be blown into pieces

1057
01:09:46,423 --> 01:09:50,326
Probably you regret meddling with affairs

1058
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:53,589
Miss Szma. you are good and refined

1059
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:54,665
Why did you help your father...

1060
01:09:54,765 --> 01:09:56,096
to do such an evil thing?

1061
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,100
What evil thing you talking about?

1062
01:09:58,202 --> 01:10:00,864
The reason he tried hard to get
the Blades...

1063
01:10:00,971 --> 01:10:01,768
was to help me to...

1064
01:10:01,873 --> 01:10:03,670
fulfill the last will of brother Linghu;

1065
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,242
That of destroying the manuals

1066
01:10:05,344 --> 01:10:06,242
What?

1067
01:10:07,212 --> 01:10:08,201
He needed the Bat Blade...

1068
01:10:08,313 --> 01:10:10,713
in order to find the manuals?

1069
01:10:10,816 --> 01:10:11,840
Of course

1070
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,747
What do you think he did all this for?

1071
01:10:13,852 --> 01:10:15,480
Didn't you know...

1072
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:17,112
the secret on the Blades is...

1073
01:10:17,223 --> 01:10:19,384
about the biggest treasured vault
in boxer world?

1074
01:10:19,492 --> 01:10:21,357
Money is all he goes after

1075
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:23,119
Who told you this?

1076
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:26,027
Miss Ximen told me before she died

1077
01:10:26,432 --> 01:10:27,331
She's talking nonsense

1078
01:10:37,444 --> 01:10:38,877
You've nowhere to go

1079
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:40,345
You will die...

1080
01:10:40,448 --> 01:10:41,915
in this mine trap

1081
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:48,922
lt's enough

1082
01:10:49,023 --> 01:10:49,887
Don't kill them

1083
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:50,780
Why?

1084
01:10:50,892 --> 01:10:53,122
Because what they said is true

1085
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:54,291
What?

1086
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:57,127
lt was for riches your dad
went after the blade

1087
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,793
ln order to refresh the memory of the Bat.

1088
01:10:59,902 --> 01:11:02,029
ln the Maple Wood.

1089
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:03,935
he kidnapped Lei-feng...

1090
01:11:04,039 --> 01:11:06,200
who looks exactly as Miss Ximen

1091
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:09,369
Pushing Mr. Xiao and Lei to visit
Leng Qiuyun.

1092
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:11,003
he asked me to pretend as a ghost

1093
01:11:11,114 --> 01:11:12,479
and to carry Lei-feng's head

1094
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:14,447
...to the Zhenyuan Security Bureau

1095
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:17,452
They'd be at the Tianlung Temple now.
urging...

1096
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:20,888
the Bat to disclose the place
of hidden treasure

1097
01:11:26,097 --> 01:11:27,997
Well...is it there?

1098
01:11:28,099 --> 01:11:28,861
No

1099
01:11:32,236 --> 01:11:33,204
Old folk

1100
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:34,772
Think again

1101
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:35,601
Those white stuff

1102
01:11:35,707 --> 01:11:38,107
One by one in a row like this

1103
01:11:38,477 --> 01:11:39,910
Those yellow and green stuff

1104
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:41,843
Piece by piece

1105
01:11:41,947 --> 01:11:42,936
Yellow?

1106
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,447
Green?

1107
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,143
No

1108
01:11:46,252 --> 01:11:46,809
No?

1109
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,682
No

1110
01:11:48,788 --> 01:11:51,689
Oh! Yes!

1111
01:11:52,192 --> 01:11:53,750
Where are they? Tell me

1112
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,557
These two women l love most

1113
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:02,562
The one in yellow is called Ximen Luoye

1114
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:06,800
The one in green is Szma Dongcheng

1115
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:10,768
Think about it now

1116
01:12:10,878 --> 01:12:12,312
or l'll ruin the two most
favorite women...

1117
01:12:12,414 --> 01:12:13,972
in your life

1118
01:12:15,717 --> 01:12:18,618
Don't ruin them...

1119
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,244
They're the women l love most

1120
01:12:20,355 --> 01:12:23,518
There's a lot of money under their skirts

1121
01:12:23,959 --> 01:12:26,190
Don't hurt them

1122
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:27,494
What did you say?

1123
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:28,894
l'll let you in on a secret

1124
01:12:28,998 --> 01:12:30,522
Don't tell anyone else

1125
01:12:30,633 --> 01:12:32,328
Okay

1126
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:35,165
l put all the jewelry...

1127
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:36,329
in the skirts...

1128
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:38,772
of my most beloved women

1129
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:40,434
ln the skirts?

1130
01:12:40,544 --> 01:12:41,306
Under the skirts

1131
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:42,901
Come on

1132
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:44,913
Go up now

1133
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:46,482
The belt. lnside the belt

1134
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:50,412
Not the belt

1135
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:53,116
ln the yellow skirt

1136
01:12:53,925 --> 01:12:56,587
Come down...

1137
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:39,596
What a treasure!

1138
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:47,874
lt's a gold vault too

1139
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:50,946
All these years of hard work is worthwhile

1140
01:13:51,053 --> 01:13:51,815
Dad

1141
01:13:53,488 --> 01:13:55,046
Aren't you looking for the
Bat's kungfu manuals here?

1142
01:13:55,691 --> 01:13:57,421
Why are you here?

1143
01:13:57,527 --> 01:13:59,154
Wu Liang told me everything

1144
01:13:59,262 --> 01:14:00,229
l don't believe it

1145
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,127
l thought because of the manuals

1146
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:03,698
...you looked for the Bat Blades

1147
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,494
l never thought...

1148
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:05,533
Silly girl

1149
01:14:05,635 --> 01:14:07,330
Don't listen to the bullshit

1150
01:14:07,437 --> 01:14:10,703
l've found the treasured vault

1151
01:14:10,808 --> 01:14:13,368
Szma Villa will be the most reputed...

1152
01:14:13,477 --> 01:14:16,844
and wealthy family in boxer world

1153
01:14:17,181 --> 01:14:20,173
A pity that you stopped at nothing
to get money

1154
01:14:21,218 --> 01:14:22,811
Who brought you here?

1155
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:23,751
lt's me

1156
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:25,283
You...

1157
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,483
l didn't believe my father to be
such a person

1158
01:14:27,592 --> 01:14:29,560
l want them to witness that my dad...

1159
01:14:29,661 --> 01:14:31,322
actually came for the manuals.
Called them to...

1160
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:33,727
see you're trying get rid of
the dirt in boxer world

1161
01:14:33,832 --> 01:14:34,992
l wanted them to see...

1162
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,228
my father is a real hero

1163
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,631
Hero?

1164
01:14:44,977 --> 01:14:46,274
Hero?

1165
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:49,942
How much does a hero worth?

1166
01:14:50,784 --> 01:14:53,844
When a man becomes old and weak.

1167
01:14:53,954 --> 01:14:54,852
you'll know...

1168
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:58,891
how much is a hero worth!

1169
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,621
l tell you the truth

1170
01:15:02,463 --> 01:15:03,623
ln fact. 10 years ago

1171
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:06,632
l let the Bat kidnap you on purpose

1172
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:11,631
So l can get the Bat Blade...

1173
01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:13,331
to find the treasured vault

1174
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:15,404
You...

1175
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,140
But it's fine...

1176
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,307
l finally get what l want

1177
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,612
Don't get closer

1178
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,743
l just stroke her acupuncture point
on the shoulder

1179
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,912
She can't move for a couple of hours

1180
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:29,514
Didn't want her to interfere
when l kill you

1181
01:16:02,627 --> 01:16:03,855
All of you are useless

1182
01:16:05,964 --> 01:16:08,024
You three aren't satisfied yet

1183
01:16:08,134 --> 01:16:11,160
You'll be dead too in a minute

1184
01:16:11,604 --> 01:16:13,572
How could you be so confident?

1185
01:16:14,173 --> 01:16:16,664
Because l'm holding the Bat Blade

1186
01:16:36,097 --> 01:16:37,758
The Blade is extremely sharp

1187
01:16:37,866 --> 01:16:39,629
Every one says so in the boxer world

1188
01:16:50,312 --> 01:16:51,506
How could this sword...?

1189
01:16:51,614 --> 01:16:53,138
The Pearl Sword is the lethal weapon

1190
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:54,580
lt can counter the Bat Blade

1191
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:30,154
The Venomous Wuxie

1192
01:17:30,255 --> 01:17:31,722
The Poisonous Doctor

1193
01:17:40,266 --> 01:17:41,665
What? You still alive?

1194
01:17:42,335 --> 01:17:43,359
Of course

1195
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,728
lf l was to die.

1196
01:17:44,838 --> 01:17:48,035
all these years of hard work
will be wasted

1197
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:48,664
You are here...

1198
01:17:48,775 --> 01:17:51,005
for the treasured vault too?

1199
01:17:54,415 --> 01:17:55,211
Correct

1200
01:17:55,649 --> 01:17:57,276
We've the same kind of...

1201
01:17:57,384 --> 01:18:00,114
reputation being righteous gentlemen
in boxer world

1202
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:03,213
We will do anything...

1203
01:18:03,324 --> 01:18:04,450
to cheat the treasure vault...

1204
01:18:04,558 --> 01:18:07,187
from those so-called notorious scumbags

1205
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:08,392
lt's a pity too...

1206
01:18:08,496 --> 01:18:10,726
our plan wasn't successful completely

1207
01:18:10,832 --> 01:18:14,097
We both got only a Bat Blade

1208
01:18:14,202 --> 01:18:15,032
l realized later...

1209
01:18:15,136 --> 01:18:17,661
you've plan on Ximen Luoye

1210
01:18:18,107 --> 01:18:20,473
So l turned your trick against you

1211
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:22,339
l gave the Blade to you...

1212
01:18:22,445 --> 01:18:24,936
and you'd find the treasured vault for us

1213
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:28,278
Now l come to get the treasured vault

1214
01:18:30,286 --> 01:18:33,552
You shameless bastard...

1215
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:36,592
Don't say that

1216
01:18:36,693 --> 01:18:37,853
From now on.

1217
01:18:37,961 --> 01:18:39,121
both of us will be...

1218
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:41,094
the most reputed gentlemen
in martial world

1219
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:42,597
From now on.

1220
01:18:42,699 --> 01:18:44,167

1221
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:47,761
No one will ever know what happened here

1223
01:18:49,741 --> 01:18:51,868
as before

1224
01:18:51,976 --> 01:18:54,410
Why are you so sure we're gonna
die here today?

1225
01:18:54,512 --> 01:18:56,605
Because the darts l threw here...

1226
01:18:56,714 --> 01:18:58,205
a moment ago

1227
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,251
lt carried the most poisonous substance...

1228
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:02,286
that can make people go crazy

1229
01:19:02,388 --> 01:19:05,448
You all draw it in your body

1230
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:08,549
When the poison starts reacting

1231
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:12,291
You'll be laughing non-stop

1232
01:19:13,066 --> 01:19:14,897
...until you are dead

1233
01:19:47,336 --> 01:19:48,132
Your poison?

1234
01:19:48,236 --> 01:19:48,964
The faster you move.

1235
01:19:49,071 --> 01:19:49,970
The faster the poison reacts

1236
01:20:26,544 --> 01:20:28,102
Your poison is really strong

1237
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:29,777
Get the vault

1238
01:20:29,882 --> 01:20:30,507
Yes

1239
01:20:30,616 --> 01:20:31,810
Listen. everyone go together

1240
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:32,645

1241
01:20:34,387 --> 01:20:36,116
Stop there

1242
01:20:37,556 --> 01:20:38,113
You...

1243
01:20:38,224 --> 01:20:39,054
Me?

1244
01:20:39,392 --> 01:20:41,257
l'm not poisoned

1245
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,124
When you threw the darts.

1246
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,164
l already realized there's something wrong

1247
01:20:45,532 --> 01:20:48,467
l held my breath and covered my nose

1248
01:20:48,568 --> 01:20:50,399
When l saw you taking off your mask

1249
01:20:50,504 --> 01:20:51,368
l knew it's safe to breath

1250
01:20:51,705 --> 01:20:54,003
Otherwise as you said...

1251
01:20:54,107 --> 01:20:55,097
l'd be surely dead now

1252
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:56,807
Give me the antidote

1253
01:20:57,145 --> 01:20:58,737
Don't give him...

1254
01:20:58,846 --> 01:20:59,437
l...

1255
01:20:59,547 --> 01:21:00,946
That's okay

1256
01:21:01,049 --> 01:21:02,607
l will...l will

1257
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:07,677
You...

1258
01:21:09,158 --> 01:21:10,022
Where's the antidote?

1259
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,999
Kill those mad men first

1260
01:21:20,102 --> 01:21:20,693
Okay

1261
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:41,381
What's the matter?

1262
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:42,545
You're poisoned

1263
01:23:42,655 --> 01:23:43,519
Now we give...

1264

1266
01:23:51,098 --> 01:23:52,087

Yes. swallow it

1275
