00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,381
<i>This is the Hungfa Temple
outside the frontier.</i>

2
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,920
<i>It's a cold winter night.</i>

3
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,884
<i>The top 28 fighters
of the world of martial arts</i>

4
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,528
<i>are here to eliminate a master.</i>

5
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:55,263
<i>They're waging
a world-shaking battle against him.</i>

6
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,302
<i>No one knows the name of the demon.</i>

7
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,999
<i>No one has ever seen his face.</i>

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,770
<i>He always covers his face
with a black and white mask.</i>

9
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,375
<i>His nickname is Bat Without Wings.</i>

10
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,848
<i>It's said that he's a lustful, horny man,</i>

11
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,441
<i>who has raped and killed many women.</i>

12
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,813
<i>So the righteous fighters united together</i>

13
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,815
<i>and chased him to the Hungfa temple,</i>

14
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,554
<i>waging a life-and-death battle against him.</i>

15
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,263
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

16
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,763
<i>only two fighters survived,</i>

17
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,962
<i>and the other 26 were killed.</i>

18
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,962
<i>But it's said that</i>

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,507
<i>the Bat was finally killed</i>

20
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,839
<i>by Iron Palm, Szma Zhongyuan.</i>

TEAHOUSE

24
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,399
Listen, there's a tea house ahead.
Let's take a break.

25
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,023
Listen up,

26
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,070
the madam instructed us to take a rest here
and eat something.

27
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,331
Okay.

28
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,635
Here.

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,048
Sir?

30
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,017
Madam, what's the matter?

31
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,145
Sir, we'd like to order.

32
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,419
Okay. I'll serve you tea first.

33
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,760
Are you from
the Zhenyuan Security Bureau?

34
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:31,852
Yes.

35
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,729
Is a certain Miss Lei-feng here?

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,732
That's me. What's the matter?

37
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,298
I have a letter for you.

38
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,776
Who left it here?

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,307
A Mr. Xiao.

40
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,508
Xiao?

41
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,010
<i>Is it Mr. Xiao Qi?</i>

42
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:01,250
<i>Madam, is he the handsome man
nicknamed the Broken-heart Sword?</i>

43
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,418
<i>Right.</i>

44
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,156
<i>The green horse with purple silk reins.</i>

45
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,459
<i>Jewelry Sword and White Gown.</i>

46
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,998
Come on. Open the letter.

47
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,234
"Come to the Tianlung Temple,
I need to talk to you."

48
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,332
Madam, I'll accompany you now.

49
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,776
Why would you go there?

50
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,505
- Captain Chen.
- Madam, what's the matter?

51
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,013
I'm meeting an acquaintance
at the Tianlung Temple.

52
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,208
You guys wait for me here.

53
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,511
Tianlung Temple?

54
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,109
It's already been abandoned.
No monk stays there anymore.

55
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,549
I'm not looking for a monk.

56
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,617
Madam.

57
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,602
What's the matter? What happened?

58
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,536
The tea is poisoned!

59
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,079
- Who are you?
- They call me the Bat.

60
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,478
What? The Bat?

61
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,009
Right.

62
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,543
There's only one Bat in the fighter's world.

63
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,617
I'm the Bat Without Wings.

64
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,222
TIANLUNG TEMPLE

65
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,520
Mr. Xiao.

66
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,692
Mr. Xiao.

67
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,514
Something urgent has come up.
Please enjoy the meal. - Xiao Qi

68
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,125
Oh, I see.

69
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,166
It smells good.

70
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,271
Why are you here?

71
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,338
I live here.

72
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,709
What about your shop?

73
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,379
The shop doesn't belong to me.

74
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,454
I just killed the shop owner

75
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,228
and used it for one day.

76
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,757
One day?

77
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,463
What for?

78
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,802
To kill people.

79
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,240
Who are you?

80
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,640
Did you use the name of Xiao Qi
intentionally to lure me here?

81
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,843
You're smart.

82
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,845
That's correct.

83
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,643
I deceived you into coming here

84
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,552
because I want you to stay here forever.

85
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,250
It's not as easy as you think.

86
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,789
My people know that I came here.

87
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,364
- They'll come to look for me.
- Your people?

88
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,269
I'm afraid they can't come here.

89
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,472
Unless you go looking for them.

90
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,234
Why?

91
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,874
Because the road to hell doesn't let you
come back.

92
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,477
You won't see them

93
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,420
unless you go to hell, too.

94
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,047
Quite impressive swordplay!

95
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,811
What the hell is this place?

96
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,457
Anyone here?

97
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,257
Come out now.

98
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,906
Who are you?

99
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,611
It seems that I'm the owner of this place.

100
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,649
Right.

101
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,322
I'm their owner as well.

102
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,799
But I've strangled them to death.

103
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,403
These are the breasts of Long Yu.

104
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,166
This is Li Fang.

105
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,512
Right.

106
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,008
These are the breasts of Cui Yu.

107
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,051
I took all of their clothes off.

108
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,377
I carve using them as models.

109
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,424
Can't draw out their true beauty however!

110
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,985
Bat Without Wings.

111
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,120
What did you say?

112
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,395
I said you're the Bat Without Wings.

113
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,201
You're still alive.

114
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,037
Five years ago,
people said you faked your death.

115
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,867
The Bat Without Wings?

116
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,176
The name sounds familiar.

117
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,610
Who are you?

118
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,276
How do you know this name?

119
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,686
I remember now.

120
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,120
- I know you...
- Don't come any closer.

121
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,691
Who is she?

122
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,419
Come on, tell me who she is.

123
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,832
Who is it? Come out now.

124
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,306
You again?

125
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,778
Of course it's me.

126
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,180
I made you come here on purpose.

127
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,774
What's the matter?

128
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,568
Feeling light-headed?

129
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,478
How do you know?

130
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,812
Because you drank the poisonous wine.

131
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,179
I don't know you.

132
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,449
I've nothing to do with you.

133
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,751
Why did you lure me here?

134
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,487
Right.

135
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,294
You've nothing to do with me.

136
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,125
But you look like somebody.

137
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,896
I can force you to tell me
the name of a person.

138
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,737
Come over here.

139
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,909
Look carefully.

140
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,947
What's her name? Tell me.

141
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,078
I know her.

142
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,207
Who?

143
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,776
It's her.

144
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,412
Do you want me to strip her clothes off
to refresh your memory?

145
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,546
No.

146
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,254
It seems I didn't strip her clothes off.

147
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,127
- I remember now.
- Who?

148
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,705
I remember now.

149
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,271
I'm very fond of her.

150
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,040
I asked her to stand here as a model,

151
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,348
and I made a sculpture of her.

152
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,477
She's the one in yellow.

153
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,178
What's her name?

154
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,287
Come on! Think!

155
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,156
- I remember her name.
- Yes?

156
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,490
Her name is beautiful.

157
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,797
Her name is Ximen Luoye.

158
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,531
Open the door.

159
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,129
Open the door.

160
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,575
- Qiuju, what's the matter?
- Where's the master?

161
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,077
- What's the matter?
- Master, something happened.

162
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,582
Something dreadful happened!
The men from the Security Bureau

163
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,413
were all killed in Maple Wood.

164
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,316
What? All killed?

165
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,983
- What are you talking about?
- Mr. Chen, the escort fighters were all killed.

166
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,258
Where's the lady?

167
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,852
Tell me now.

168
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,295
Han Shen,

169
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,966
Feng-erh is indeed your fiance,

170
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,968
but you need to be patient
and let her speak.

171
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,695
Qiuju, where's Feng-erh?

172
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,172
The lady got a letter from Mr. Xiao Qi,

173
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,267
and went to the Tianlung Temple
outside Maple Wood.

174
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,878
That's the last time I saw her

175
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,379
Mr. Xiao Qi?

176
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,210
How did Feng-erh know Xiao Qi?

177
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,851
- Did Xiao kill the fighters?
- No.

178
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,856
The killer was a very horrible person.

179
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,289
He's called the Bat Without Wings.

180
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,759
What? The Bat Without Wings!

181
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,792
Could you be mistaken?
He died five years ago.

182
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,026
How could he kill people?

183
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,934
He called himself the Bat Without Wings.
I did see him killing the fighters.

184
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,528
No more bullshit about him anymore.

185
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:31,074
Bring my sword here.
Hurry to the temple now.

186
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,438
Hurry up

187
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,804
Master,

188
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,209
Xiao wasn't at the temple.

189
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,280
How do you know?

190
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,475
This morning, someone said
he went to the Taibai restaurant

191
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,642
in the eastern part of town.

192
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,777
- He's expecting a friend.
- Taibai restaurant?

193
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,319
Stop arguing please.

194
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,322
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,189
Someone reserved the entire restaurant.

196
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,788
Excuse me.

197
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,598
- Take a look around.
- Yes.

198
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,676
Mr. Xiao,

199
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,506
you've finally come.

200
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,680
Shangguan Wangsun,
the wealthiest man in the south.

201
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,311
Why were you so eager to find me?

202
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,147
Please take a look at this.

203
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,647
FIRST HOUR OF CHONGYANG

204
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,157
This is an assassination order
from the Hell Gang.

205
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,720
It says to kill you
at the first hour of the Chongyang Festival.

206
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,190
Today is the Chongyang Festival.

207
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,563
The time has come.

208
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,499
Quick, put it down.

209
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,604
Hurry up

210
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,203
These are my precious jewels and stones.

211
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,145
I hope you will take them, Mr. Xiao.

212
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,256
The Hell Gang!

213
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,908
- So you're hiding here. Go!
- Yes.

214
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,449
I didn't think there'd be four extra punks
on the Taibai restaurant menu.

215
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,787
I didn't think I'd have to kill
someone other than Shangguan.

216
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,373
Who are you?

217
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,407
Jewelry Sword and White Gown.

218
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,007
Xiao Qi?

219
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,087
Shangguan had nothing to do with you.

220
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,621
Besides, he is famous for his kindness.

221
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,019
Why do you need to kill him?

222
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,718
The Hell Gang makes a living
by killing people.

223
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,523
Mr. Xiao, you'd better stay away
from my business.

224
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,756
Okay.

225
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,525
Then you leave now.

226
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,101
Do you mean if we leave now,

227
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,794
you'll stay away from our business
with Shangguan?

228
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,137
Mr. Xiao, you...

229
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,402
Your money guarantees
your safety in this restaurant,

230
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,307
but not in other places.

231
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,874
- So...
- Okay.

232
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,475
We're leaving now.

233
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,571
Wait.

234
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,343
- You didn't listen to my words carefully.
- What is it?

235
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,978
I mean you may leave here

236
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,351
only once you've died.

237
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,154
Thanks for saving me, Mr. Xiao.

238
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,489
You're welcome.

239
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,496
Mr. Shangguan, can I ask you a favor?

240
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,395
Sure.

241
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,067
I heard there's serious flooding in Jiangnan.

242
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,697
Please take the jewels to help the victims.
Is that okay?

243
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,805
But they belong to you.

244
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,177
I saved you today
only because you're a good man,

245
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,804
not because you're wealthy.

246
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,477
Excuse me.

247
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,346
Sorry for the trouble.

248
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,818
- Carry the stuff away.
- Yes.

249
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,904
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

250
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:35,869
Pal.

251
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,739
You've been here for two hours.

252
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,583
Why do you keep hiding?

253
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,083
Who are you?

254
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,385
I was the one who hired the Ghost King
to kill Shangguan.

255
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,666
I've something very important to do.
I need a favor from you.

256
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,730
But I want someone who is a real expert.

257
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,305
So you sent the Ghost King to test me.

258
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,068
Right. If you couldn't kill the Ghost King,

259
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,479
you wouldn't be able to kill
Bat Without Wings.

260
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,243
Is he still alive?

261
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,819
I bet you know what happened
at the Hungfa Temple in Mount Wudang

262
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,185
five years ago.

263
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,193
It's said he did die that day.

264
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,955
There is such a rumor in the fighter's world.

265
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,693
But my father took
the Bat Blades to the frontier,

266
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,128
and he never returned.

267
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,669
The Bat is the only one

268
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,968
who wants my father dead.

269
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,999
Your father is...

270
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,512
Szma Zhongyuan of Szma Villa.

271
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,574
So you're Szma Dongcheng.

272
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,550
People kept talking about you
a few years ago.

273
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,381
I'm here to ask you to find out
where my father is.

274
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,752
In other words,

275
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,155
I want to know if the Bat is really dead.

276
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,156
There are so many people here today.

277
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,292
Are you looking for me, too?

278
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:10,033
You're wrong this time.
We're looking for Miss Szma.

279
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,303
I don't know you guys. You're...

280
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,278
Venomous Wuxie, the Stun-dude.

281
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,076
I'm the poisonous Dr. Wang Wuxie.

282
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,952
I'm the Grim and Bewitching Xu Fang.

283
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,681
Two other excellent assassins are here.

284
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,948
Did someone hire you to kill me?

285
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,082
No.

286
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,429
There's a big secret in the fighter's world.

287
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,997
One of the Bat Blades is in your hands.

288
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,768
So someone hired us to rob it from you.

289
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,370
Didn't you hear?

290
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,463
My father and the Blade are missing.

291
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,502
Who will believe you?

292
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,908
<i>I will.</i>

293
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,879
Miss Szma.

294
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,782
I'll do as you request.

295
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,512
You may leave now.

296
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,920
Really?

297
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,013
How arrogant!

298
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,669
Miss Szma, I said you may go now.

299
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,265
No one can stop you from leaving.

300
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,106
Thanks for your help.

301
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,513
Xiao, why don't you mind
your own business?

302
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,379
It's my nature.

303
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,577
Go to hell!

304
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,058
I think you'd better go now,

305
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,966
or you'll die.

306
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,102
- Goodbye, Xiao Qi.
- Goodbye, Xiao Qi.

307
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,576
- Is Xiao here?
- He's upstairs.

308
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,568
Sir.

309
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,314
The Taibai restaurant is very busy today.

310
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,643
Sir.

311
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,315
- Are you Mr. Xiao?
- Yes.

312
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,151
Did you ask my daughter, Lei-feng,
to see you at the Tianlung Temple?

313
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,417
Your daughter?

314
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,852
Sir, I don't even know you.

315
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,792
How could I know your daughter?

316
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,165
I'm Lei Xun
of the Zhenyuan Security Bureau.

317
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,199
He's my daughter's fiance, Han Shen.

318
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,866
- Did you see the Bat Without Wings?
- What? The Bat without Wings again?

319
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,131
Right.

320
00:24:55,227 --> 00:25:00,540
In Maple Wood, my fighters were killed
by a man called the Bat Without Wings.

321
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,546
But before he killed my men,

322
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,173
he gave my daughter a letter,
saying that you'd meet her at the temple.

323
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,565
Lei-feng.

324
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,431
Lei-feng.

325
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,363
This is my first time here.

326
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,532
I didn't ask your daughter to meet me.

327
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,700
Look.

328
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:44,276
"Come to the Tianlung Temple,
I need to talk to you. Xiao Qi."

329
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,953
This isn't my handwriting.

330
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,285
This is a check with my handwriting.

331
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,923
The handwriting of his name is different.

332
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,927
The Bat must have tricked
Lei-feng into coming here.

333
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,970
Lei-feng, Lei-feng!

334
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,776
- Lei-feng.
- Weird!

335
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,675
I heard that the Bat died five years ago.

336
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,770
How could he appear again?

337
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,607
And get me involved?

338
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,847
- Did you see Lei-feng?
- No.

339
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,685
There are only trees inside.

340
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,020
Mr. Lei, no matter what happens,

341
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:24,992
Miss Lei-feng won't be here.

342
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,994
I think you'd better go home.

343
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,429
Maybe she's safe and home now.

344
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,858
Cai.

345
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,862
Cai. Cai.

346
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,701
Who is it?

347
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,565
<i>It's me.</i>

348
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,872
You're... Who are you?

349
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:20,283
Keeper Feng! Don't you recognize me?

350
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,546
Our lady?

351
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,788
<i>Right. It's me.</i>

352
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,722
Great. The master is looking
for you everywhere.

353
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,854
<i>I know.</i>

354
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,956
<i>I know he's looking for me.</i>

355
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,661
<i>That's why I send my head back to him.</i>

356
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,431
<i>Here is my head.</i>

357
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,010
<i>Please give it to my father.</i>

358
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,807
Help! Someone please help!

359
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,284
What's the matter?

360
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,377
- The lady...
- The lady?

361
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,320
- Where?
- It's her.

362
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:04,985
- Lady!
- Lady!

363
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,557
Where is she?

364
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,361
- Look! Over there.
- Look!

365
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,668
That's her.

366
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:20,437
Lady!

367
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,437
Go.

368
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,217
Where's the lady's left hand?

369
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,381
Keeper Feng!

370
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,783
Feng-erh! Where are you?

371
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,094
Uncle, I remember the hill near the temple.

372
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,321
That's where Aunt Zheng lives.

373
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,625
Feng and I used to go there as children.

374
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,666
Maybe Lei-feng went to her house?

375
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,496
Okay. Let's go.

376
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,197
- Mr. Xiao, we'll be right back.
- Okay.

377
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,046
- You're...
- I'm lost.

378
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,894
Excuse me,
which way should I go to head west?

379
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,257
Are you going to the Tianlung Temple?

380
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,329
No.

381
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,690
I need to go somewhere very far away.

382
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,003
You go straight from here.

383
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,432
Thanks.

384
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,746
Miss.

385
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,077
It's late. Where are you from?

386
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,377
I'm from the Black Lake near Maple Wood.

387
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,255
Goodbye.

388
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,265
- Feng-erh.
- Lei-feng.

389
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:53,902
- Feng-erh!
- Lei-feng!

390
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,696
Lei-feng!

391
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,866
Feng-erh!

392
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,533
Lei-feng!

393
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,168
Mr. Xiao, where's Feng-erh going?

394
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,246
Feng-erh?

395
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,239
The person who just left is Lei-feng.

396
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:09,148
No way. The woman I saw is quite old.

397
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,845
Didn't your daughter just turn 16?

398
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,012
What?

399
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,647
- Was she that old?
- Sure.

400
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,986
I'm pretty sure about that.

401
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,651
Your house is in the southeast.

402
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,990
But she said she needs to head far west.

403
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,155
West?

404
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,929
The paradise in the west?

405
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,598
Uncle, something is weird.

406
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,364
We'd better go back to the Security Bureau.

407
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,722
Sir.

408
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,492
Thank you.

409
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,823
Are you all right?

410
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,920
I'm fine.

411
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,693
The blind usually tend to stumble.

412
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,864
What the hell!

413
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:05,742
Do you think my arm is pretty?

414
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,067
Yes.

415
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,935
As pretty as a woman's hand.

416
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,776
Let me give it to you, then.

417
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,979
This is the arm of Lei-feng.

418
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,126
Aren't you blind?

419
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,595
Of course not.

420
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,663
Where's my daughter?

421
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:38,200
Apart from the arm,

422
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,476
I've sent the rest of her
to the Security Bureau.

423
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,112
Who the hell are you?

424
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,672
Me?

425
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,757
People call me the Bat Without Wings.

426
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,285
Didn't you die five years ago?

427
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,592
Do I look like a dead person?

428
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,847
Broken-heart Sword Xiao Qi is really good.

429
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,822
It's almost dawn, I need to leave now.

430
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,730
Goodbye.

431
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,197
The Bat.

432
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,768
He's the Bat Without Wings?

433
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,102
I don't know.

434
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,143
Only a few people have seen him before.

435
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,155
- Feng-erh.
- Lei-feng.

436
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,852
- Master, you can't go.
- Why?

437
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,360
Because she's been cut into pieces.

438
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,988
- Her head is cut off as well.
- What?

439
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,624
Lei-feng!

440
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,135
Hold up the master.

441
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,533
Get him some medicine, hurry up.

442
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:49,970
Hurry up

443
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,405
Did your lady come back without an arm?

444
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,498
How could you know?

445
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,135
Because I met the Bat Without Wings
in Maple Wood.

446
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,372
What?

447
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,506
Sir, where are you going?

448
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,606
I want revenge on the Bat.

449
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,947
- Do you know where he is?
- I don't know.

450
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,354
I heard of the duel at the frontier that year.
Twenty-six fighters were killed by the Bat.

451
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,518
<i>Only the Iron Palm, Szma Zhongyuan,</i>

452
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,222
<i>and the Thousand-faced Scholar,
Leng Qiuyun, survived.</i>

453
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,061
Szma went missing recently.

454
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,832
So Leng Qiuyun is the only one left.

455
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,298
I'm going to see Leng now.

456
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,446
Strange! Why are there so many people
here tonight?

457
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:40,614
Hold it.

458
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,817
These people are dead.

459
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,018
What?

460
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,210
They're really dead.

461
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,876
The Bat knew we'd come here
if we were looking for Mr. Leng.

462
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,718
This is a warning.

463
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,321
Look.

464
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,083
Wang Wuxie, Xu Fang.

465
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,103
They're the top killers.

466
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,472
Only a few fighters can tackle them.

467
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,205
You're right.

468
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,184
Who is it?

469
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,287
Who's hiding here?

470
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,792
Come out.

471
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,085
No one is speaking at all.

472
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,665
The person who speaks is actually here.

473
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,702
Well, who's really dead?

474
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:03,966
Who's faking their death?

475
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:05,632
It's clear now.

476
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,069
How did you know they were speaking?

477
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,010
Many people know ventriloquism.

478
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,408
Their lips don't need to move
when they speak.

479
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,282
No wonder you're famous
in the fighter's world.

480
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,580
But it's a pity you like
to meddle in the affairs of others.

481
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,603
You want to see my lifting skills.

482
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,534
They forced us to the river bank on purpose.

483
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,605
Right.

484
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,833
My nickname is Venomous Wuxie.

485
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,208
In the pond,
I've put the most poisonous drug

486
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,007
of our Tang School.

487
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,551
Once you touch the water,

488
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,281
your whole body will swell to death.

489
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,951
There's nothing in the pond, not even a leaf.

490
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,487
You've nowhere to stand

491
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,155
and you will surely die.

492
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,135
It looks as if they knew we were looking for
the Thousand-faced Scholar.

493
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,006
Let's hurry to Leng's Garden now.

494
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,906
LENG'S GARDEN

495
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,221
Look.

496
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,925
SPIRITUAL TABLET OF LENG QIUYUN

497
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,164
How could he be dead as well?

498
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,135
Once again they prove to be faster.

499
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,499
We're late.

500
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:51,733
Right.

501
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,608
You're late.

502
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:02,808
Unfortunately, my lord suddenly died
of a disease three days ago.

503
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,758
He didn't have many friends
when he was alive.

504
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:14,488
But when he died,
many people came looking for him.

505
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:18,157
Seems like there's more
than one dead person here.

506
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,895
Why are there so many dead people?

507
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,234
How do you know they're dead?

508
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,269
Stop.

509
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,782
Please stop.

510
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,253
Are you the Broken-heart Sword Xiao Qi?

511
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,726
Yes, I am.

512
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,065
So you're not from the Bat's gang.

513
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,431
We're here to look for the Bat.

514
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,091
Why?

515
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,305
Because his daughter was killed by the Bat.

516
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,935
He seeks the Bat for revenge.

517
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,607
But we're late.

518
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,207
I never expected Mr. Leng to be dead.

519
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,407
The people here are strange,

520
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,041
just like them.

521
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,585
Those who should have died are still alive.

522
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,815
Do you want to see Leng Qiuyun?

523
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,019
Follow me.

524
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,152
Sir, are you bringing us to see Mr. Leng?

525
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,623
Where's he now?

526
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,526
He's here.

527
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,524
In fact, I wasn't dead.

528
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,694
I just wanted to defend myself
against the Bat.

529
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,531
So I pretended that I was dead.

530
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,666
You do believe that the Bat is still alive?

531
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,776
Yes.

532
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,613
Because the Bat didn't die at all.

533
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,376
<i>He got hit in the forehead</i>

534
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,509
<i>by the Iron Palm of Mr. Szma and fainted</i>

535
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:18,978
He became insane

536
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,557
after he regained consciousness.

537
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,821
He didn't remember anything.

538
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,990
To maintain peace amongst people,

539
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:30,089
we announced that he'd died.

540
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,294
Actually, we locked him
on the Bamboo Island.

541
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:34,964
Bamboo Island?

542
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,197
Right.

543
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,304
It's an isolated island.

544
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,138
It's very close to the Szma Villa.

545
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,510
Szma is an expert in the traps.

546
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,345
He set traps and land mines on the island.

547
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,780
Even an expert fighter

548
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,615
can't get there easily.

549
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,521
I really don't understand.

550
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,183
He's a mad man.

551
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,954
How could he possibly escape?

552
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,758
How can you be sure it is him?

553
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,355
If it wasn't him,

554
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,661
then who killed Szma Zhongyuan?

555
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,970
Who stole the Bat Blades
from Szma Dongcheng?

556
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,937
You're saying the blade that
Szma Dongcheng lost is the Bat Blade?

557
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,168
Right.

558
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,812
I believe it's the Bat Blade.

559
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,381
It's said that there's a pair of Bat Blades.

560
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,541
The Bat carried them wherever he went.

561
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,711
That's the treasure
that many fighters want to have.

562
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,016
How could Dongcheng get it?

563
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,357
It's a long story.

564
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:36,497
You probably knew that
the Bat has kidnapped many pretty women.

565
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,964
He raped and then killed them.

566
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,230
Among those hundreds of victims,

567
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,101
there were only two exceptions.

568
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,734
I heard that these two women were so pretty
that they were spared.

569
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,307
The Bat let them go,

570
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,617
and gave away his Blades to both of them.

571
00:42:55,773 --> 00:43:00,017
One of them is Szma Dongcheng.

572
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,182
Who is the other one?

573
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,629
- Lei-feng.
- That's not Lei-feng.

574
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,862
She's my fiance.

575
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,234
No one knows this secret.

576
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,901
That's because of her.

577
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,240
I risked my life fighting against the Bat.

578
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:25,503
Strange!

579
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,605
She looks like my daughter.

580
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:32,752
Maybe that's why
the Bat kidnapped your daughter.

581
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,156
Where is she now?

582
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,418
Sorry.

583
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,857
For her safety,

584
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,553
I cannot tell you.

585
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:44,196
- Why?
- I heard that there's a big secret

586
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,234
regarding these two Bat Blades.

587
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:52,672
Now that Miss Szma has lost her Blade,
I'm afraid someone has got plans for it.

588
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,367
Fine.

589
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,840
Anyway, we're looking for the Bat only.

590
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,409
It would be better if you keep silent.

591
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,347
I don't want a misunderstanding.

592
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,681
Well, we shouldn't have disturbed you.

593
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,312
Thanks for the information.

594
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,251
Goodbye.

595
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,656
See you.

596
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,092
You go ahead in this direction.

597
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,255
Passing Lingding Isle,
you'll see Bamboo Island.

598
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,093
We saw a road here a moment ago.

599
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,855
Why are there bamboos blocking
the road here?

600
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,761
Right, I feel like as we're making our way,

601
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,093
the bamboos are moving with us
at the same time.

602
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,292
Right.

603
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,130
The bamboo is moving along.

604
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,464
- What?
- What?

605
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,373
Have you heard of Taoist magic?

606
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:32,972
Yeah, sure.

607
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,638
There are few people in the fighter's world
who know the tricks.

608
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,341
Szma Zhongyuan is probably one of them.

609
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,542
What is Taoist magic?

610
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,085
It's the same as a trap.

611
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,415
But it's very crafty.

612
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,083
It combines the tricks of Taoist magic
with mechanical switchboards,

613
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,026
producing many forms of traps
and locking people inside.

614
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,589
Like now, for instance.

615
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,858
It seems as if we're close to the balcony.

616
00:45:57,188 --> 00:46:01,227
But no matter how hard we try,
we couldn't get the boat across.

617
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,267
The traps under the water, the bamboos,

618
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,309
they will block our way automatically.

619
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,455
No wonder Szma Zhongyuan managed
to lock the Bat here.

620
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,355
Look!

621
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,797
The Bat Without Wings.

622
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,044
Szma Zhongyuan is really good.

623
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,276
He's helped go across.

624
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,910
If anyone tried to rescue the Bat,

625
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,749
he'd be surely dead.

626
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,282
What should we do?

627
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,284
Get to the shore first.

628
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,091
How could we?

629
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,597
Taoist magic is beyond our understanding.

630
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,496
It seems to know everything.

631
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:08,035
There's only one way to break it.

632
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,071
And that's to go against it.

633
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,505
We go that way
if we want to go to the balcony.

634
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:15,971
Come on.

635
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,999
There are traps everywhere.

636
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,376
Is he the Bat Without Wings?

637
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,913
Look at the chains. He's probably the Bat.

638
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,351
No. He doesn't look like
the one in Maple Wood.

639
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,291
Let's take a look there.

640
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,415
The water is toxic.

641
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,987
Many people must have died here.

642
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,572
"Enter without permission and die."

643
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:29,675
It's made of iron.

644
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:37,145
Guess we should climb up the bamboo
to get there like we did before.

645
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,811
I think it's the only way out.

646
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,033
We're trapped again.

647
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,165
We must be, because the traps are moving
under the water again.

648
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,603
Who are you?

649
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,542
Don't you know who I am?

650
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,048
I'm the Bat Without Wings.

651
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,486
Why did you kill my daughter?

652
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:08,909
Where is he?

653
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:11,138
I saw someone throwing darts at us.

654
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,146
But there's no way out of here.

655
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,886
Strange! Where did the people go?

656
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,643
It's a nice house.

657
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,878
Who owns it?

658
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,386
Who are you, sir?

659
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:43,761
You enter Szma Villa without permission.

660
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,598
What is so urgent?

661
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,664
Szma Villa?

662
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:49,737
Yes.

663
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:54,276
This is my house.

664
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,270
Mr. Xiao and Mr. Lei.

665
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,381
Why did you come out over there?

666
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:04,078
We tried to catch the Bat on Bamboo Island.

667
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,018
But he escaped through a tunnel
in a small house.

668
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,852
We went after him
but unexpectedly turned up here.

669
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,984
Really?

670
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,793
So what, the Bat isn't dead?

671
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:15,863
Right.

672
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,024
The Bat Without Wings didn't die.

673
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,295
The traps on the Bamboo Island
were set up by our master

674
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,627
to imprison the Bat.

675
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:27,602
To help us look after the idiot,
after he made this underground tunnel.

676
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,470
Regardless,

677
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,105
since you gentlemen are here,

678
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,150
please let me offer you some wine.

679
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,651
Hope you'll have a good stay here.

680
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,091
Please.

681
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,286
Thanks.

682
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:55,196
Mr. Lei, how did you suddenly find out
the Bat is on the island?

683
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,068
Mr. Leng Qiuyun told us.

684
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,331
If I guess right,

685
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,070
the Bat has already escaped the island.

686
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,971
Because that is another one that I just saw.

687
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,207
Really?

688
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:12,015
It may have a connection
to my father's death at the frontier.

689
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:13,948
Anyway,

690
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,614
it's already dark now.

691
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:18,886
Please stay here for a night
and leave tomorrow.

692
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,743
Sleep late to enjoy the moonlight.

693
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,246
Rise early to tend to the flowers.

694
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:43,107
It's late.
Why don't you go to bed, Miss Szma?

695
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,618
Is it because you are fond of the moon?

696
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:46,687
No.

697
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:49,786
It's quiet in the villa.

698
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,422
Since my father left,

699
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,056
no one has visited us.

700
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,924
So whenever there's a full moon,

701
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,797
I come here to think about the past.

702
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,994
Still missing Hero Linghu?

703
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,197
You know our relationship?

704
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:10,477
Everyone in the fighter's world knows
you were a perfect match.

705
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,546
Unfortunately, the Bat abducted you.

706
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:18,719
<i>Hero Linghu tried to save you
and went to the frontier.</i>

707
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,621
<i>But he was killed by that madman.</i>

708
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,716
Linghu Tian and my father
went to the frontier,

709
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,590
but it wasn't because of me.

710
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,562
Because he believed the Bat never hurt me.

711
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,256
The reason I accompanied your father

712
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,703
was because he told me
the Bat kept two kung fu manuals.

713
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:44,879
If I didn't destroy them, it would be
a disaster for the world of martial arts.

714
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,546
But there are already seven people.

715
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,346
Why did you have to go?

716
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:52,651
Dongcheng,

717
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:57,214
a great man should only enjoy himself
once his loved ones are pleased.

718
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,251
How can I leave the other folk alone?

719
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,659
Promise me you will come back.

720
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:06,968
I'll come back.

721
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,127
He said he'd come back.

722
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,636
But he didn't.

723
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,171
He wanted to look for the manuals.

724
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,081
But I couldn't fulfill his last wish.

725
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,414
Fighters are always looking
for fame and money.

726
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:26,977
Hero Linghu is very exceptional.

727
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,759
It's no surprise that
whenever there's a full moon,

728
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,554
you come here to mourn.

729
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:36,260
Well, the night is deep and the fog is heavy.

730
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,264
I spoke too much.

731
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,069
I think it's already midnight.

732
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:44,634
You'd better go to bed.

733
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:47,142
Tomorrow we bid farewell.

734
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,375
Please.

735
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:02,989
Mr. Lei.

736
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,853
In the small house on Bamboo Island,
do you remember a pair of stone deer?

737
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,021
There's a pair over
at the Tianlung Temple, too.

738
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,759
Do you think they are the same?

739
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,195
Now that you remind me.

740
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:18,366
Do you think the two pairs of deer

741
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:19,702
have the same mechanism?

742
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,333
Who's there?

743
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,099
Please show yourself.

744
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:35,140
It looks like tonight someone has invited us
here on purpose.

745
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:36,707
Look!

746
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:46,327
What a big stone statue!

747
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,897
This painting,
didn't we see it in Mr. Leng's house?

748
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:01,535
Could it be possible
that one of these two statues is Miss Szma?

749
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:04,879
The other one is the mysterious lady Leng.

750
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:06,870
Possibly.

751
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,280
It must be the home of the Bat.

752
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,115
Who is the mysterious woman in yellow?

753
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,149
If we can locate her,

754
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:19,887
we may find the Bat and discover his secret.

755
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,520
If this is the Bat's home,

756
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,895
he must bring all the girls back here.

757
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,634
Let's check the place out.
We may find some clues.

758
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:28,725
Right.

759
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:44,214
Come take a look.

760
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,514
Lei-feng wore this the other day. Am I right?

761
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,420
Right. Her mother embroidered
the edge for her.

762
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:53,285
I think when she died, she was tied up here.

763
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,455
Look!

764
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,460
This was Lei-feng's handwriting.

765
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,935
She probably wrote it before she died.

766
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:04,999
"Ximen."

767
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,667
Which Ximen?

768
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,209
Could it be Ximen Luoye?

769
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,446
"Ximen Luoye."

770
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,276
Mr. Lei, how did you know?

771
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,284
There are two pretty women
in the world of martial arts.

772
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,582
One is Szma Dongcheng.

773
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,452
The other one is Ximen Luoye.

774
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,684
The Ximen family is very reputed
in the fighter's world.

775
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,055
They're very strict and disciplined.

776
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,220
No one ever sees her.

777
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,258
Do you know where she is now?

778
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:34,961
The Ximen family of aristocrats
has withered and has completely declined.

779
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,435
They have lost all of their glamor.

780
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,107
I heard Miss Ximen stays in
Shiau Shiang House

781
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,370
somewhere in the suburbs of Hangzhou.

782
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,679
SHIAU SHIANG HOUSE

783
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,727
Thank you, miss.

784
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:05,359
Xi-erh,

785
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,437
except you, no one has talked to me

786
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,038
in all these years.

787
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,128
That's not true.

788
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,535
- Who, then?
- Me.

789
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:23,042
You?

790
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,951
I haven't seen you in five years.

791
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:30,218
But you're as pretty as before.

792
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,221
- What are you doing here?
- I need the Bat's Blade that you kept.

793
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,263
Why did you kill them?

794
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:47,535
To keep their mouths shut.

795
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,770
I guessed right.

796
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,609
You're not the Bat Without Wings.

797
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,478
Miss Ximen is as clever as the people say.

798
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:11,024
If you don't want to die,
hand over the Bat's Blade.

799
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,897
But if you kill me,
you will never get the Blade.

800
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,994
Why are you saying
I will never get the Blade?

801
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,264
Master.

802
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,465
We have the Bat Blade.

803
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,510
Miss Ximen.

804
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:27,741
Do you really think I'm here for the Blade?

805
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,613
It's just a plot to lure you out here.

806
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:32,311
My men have already got it.

807
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:53,602
I lied.

808
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,711
I asked my guys to trick you,

809
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,509
and you easily fell into my trap
and showed me where the Blade was.

810
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:01,581
You.

811
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:11,053
You're really beautiful.

812
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:14,953
No wonder that madman was fond of you.

813
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:19,295
Stop or I'll kill myself.

814
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,429
Are you sure?

815
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,231
No way.

816
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:29,066
Miss Ximen!

817
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,269
Go.

818
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,869
Miss Ximen.

819
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:42,915
- Here.
- How are you?

820
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,659
Don't touch me.

821
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,920
I have no hope.

822
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,726
If you're here for the Bat Blade,

823
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,363
you're too late.

824
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,767
Who has come?

825
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,369
The Bat Without Wings.

826
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,600
He's taken the Blade away.

827
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,208
But that's not the real Bat.

828
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,374
What?

829
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,217
Then who is he?

830
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,323
What? Him?

831
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,430
Miss Ximen.

832
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,669
Xiao Qi.
I never imagined you to be faster than us.

833
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,328
Come on, hand it over.

834
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,235
As it is, the Blade isn't here.

835
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,932
We're busy, you see for yourselves.

836
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,100
Stop.

837
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,116
Mr. Lei, don't get caught up with them.
Let's go.

838
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,187
Okay.

839
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,782
Go.

840
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,184
Chase.

841
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:01,763
Big brother, please.

842
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,543
Our plan was successful.

843
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,389
It's lucky that you arrived on time,

844
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,325
or Xiao Qi would have discovered
that I was holding my breath.

845
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:32,065
Okay, let them fight
and we'll take advantage of the end result.

846
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,055
Dad, you're back?

847
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,894
Here's the Blade.

848
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,237
Is it the Blade of the Ximen family?

849
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,433
It's strange.

850
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,981
Xiao Qi had gone to Ximen's house.

851
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:56,344
They met Leng Qiuyun.

852
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,646
Did Leng tell them everything?

853
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,155
I think

854
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:03,852
Leng is a very mysterious person.

855
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,451
Since he's been back from the frontier,

856
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,495
he's been avoiding everyone.

857
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:13,165
Right. Did Ximen Luoye tell Xiao
who you are?

858
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:14,557
No.

859
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:18,161
When they got there,
Ximen Luoye had killed herself.

860
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,462
Killed herself?

861
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:20,700
Come on.

862
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:23,175
Bring out the other Bat Blade.

863
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,420
Dad, both the Blades are here now.

864
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:42,826
Let's find out where the secret is hidden.

865
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:51,497
"Temple. Lung Tian."

866
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:56,805
"Tianlung Temple."

867
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:01,639
Right. I'd already guessed the stuff
was hidden under the Tianlung Temple.

868
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,776
But I searched thoroughly. I couldn't find it.

869
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:07,347
The name of the temple was carved
on the Blade.

870
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:08,888
It must be inside the temple.

871
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,390
Why don't you bring
the madman to help you?

872
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,129
Right, he could help.

873
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:17,421
Men.

874
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,561
Dad.

875
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:24,868
If you find the kung fu manuals,

876
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:26,838
promise me you'll destroy them.

877
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,068
I want to fulfill the will of brother Linghu.

878
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,337
Don't worry.

879
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,413
I've tried hard to find the Blades

880
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,243
and that's because of you.

881
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:50,689
Come on.

882
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:56,361
Go.

883
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:02,036
Master, here are your clothes.

884
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,170
Go.

885
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,793
Where's the master?

886
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,988
He took the madman away by the back door.

887
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,224
- What's the matter?
- Xiao Qi is here.

888
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:28,495
- What?
- Miss Szma.

889
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:33,937
Mr. Xiao, why are you here so late?

890
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,540
We're looking for someone in here.

891
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:37,667
Who?

892
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,611
The Bat Without Wings.

893
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,042
Ask Szma Zhongyuan to come out.

894
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,383
Miss Ximen told me everything
before she died.

895
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:50,283
She's the only one
who knew who the Bat is.

896
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:51,517
Szma Dongcheng.

897
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,651
Tell your dad to apologize
for my daughter's death.

898
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,291
Szma Dongcheng,

899
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,891
you're from a reputed fighter family.

900
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,026
How could you do this?

901
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:08,234
I don't think it's the right time
to discuss this.

902
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:47,740
Go now.

903
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:30,382
Stop.

904
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:35,893
You probably know
how powerful our trap is.

905
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:39,296
You're now in the middle of the mine trap.

906
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,163
The bamboo around you is rigged
with dynamite.

907
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:45,330
The four strings of this instrument

908
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:48,943
are linked to the trap.

909
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,440
If I snap a string,

910
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,678
you'll be blown to pieces.

911
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,944
You probably regret meddling in my affairs.

912
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,885
Miss Szma, you are good and refined.

913
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:07,484
Why did you help your father
with such an evil thing?

914
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,563
What evil thing are you talking about?

915
01:13:09,652 --> 01:13:12,428
The reason he tried hard to get the Blades

916
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:15,434
was to help me fulfill
the last will of brother Linghu,

917
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,060
destroying the manuals.

918
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,160
What?

919
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,198
He needed the Bat Blades

920
01:13:20,296 --> 01:13:22,799
in order to find the manuals?

921
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:23,968
Of course.

922
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,977
What do you think he did all this for?

923
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,481
Don't you know the secret on the Blades is

924
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,848
the whereabouts of the biggest
treasured vault in the fighter's world?

925
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:33,887
Money is all he's after.

926
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:35,816
Who told you this?

927
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,653
Miss Ximen told me before she died.

928
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,185
She's talking nonsense.

929
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,162
You have nowhere to go.

930
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,901
You will die in this mine trap.

931
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:02,311
That's enough.

932
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:03,911
Don't kill them.

933
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,577
- Why?
- Because what they said is true.

934
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:08,244
What?

935
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:11,120
It was for riches that your dad went after
the Blade.

936
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:13,921
<i>In order to refresh the Bat's memory,</i>

937
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:16,223
<i>in Maple Wood,</i>

938
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,264
<i>he kidnapped Lei-feng,</i>

939
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:20,630
<i>who looks exactly like Miss Ximen.</i>

940
01:14:20,723 --> 01:14:23,966
<i>This pushed Mr. Xiao and Lei
to visit Leng Qiuyun.</i>

941
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,630
<i>He asked me to pretend to be a ghost,</i>

942
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:28,902
<i>and to carry Lei-feng's head
to the Zhenyuan Security Bureau.</i>

943
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,338
They'd be at the Tianlung Temple now,

944
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:35,780
urging the Bat to disclose
the place of the hidden treasure.

945
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:42,981
Well, is it there?

946
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:44,481
No.

947
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,660
Old man.

948
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:50,321
Think again.

949
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,992
The white stuff.
One by one in a row like this.

950
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,797
The yellow and green stuff.

951
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:57,427
Piece by piece.

952
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,527
Yellow?

953
01:14:58,627 --> 01:14:59,799
Green?

954
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,199
No.

955
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:03,902
- No?
- No.

956
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,605
Yes!

957
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:10,050
Where are they? Tell me.

958
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:13,951
The two women I love most.

959
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:18,554
<i>The one in yellow is called Ximen Luoye.</i>

960
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:23,490
<i>The one in green is Szma Dongcheng.</i>

961
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:30,829
Think about it now
or I'll ruin your two favorite women.

962
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,100
Don't ruin them!

963
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,939
They're the women I love most.

964
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,570
There's a lot of money under their skirts.

965
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,615
Don't hurt them.

966
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,341
What did you say?

967
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:48,479
I'll let you in on a secret.
Don't tell anyone else.

968
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:49,954
Okay.

969
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:53,325
I put all the jewelry

970
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,862
in the skirts of my most beloved women.

971
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:58,632
In the skirts?

972
01:15:58,721 --> 01:15:59,995
Under the skirts.

973
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:01,432
Come on.

974
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:03,333
Go up now.

975
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:05,132
The belt, inside the belt.

976
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:09,271
Not the belt.

977
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:11,811
In the yellow skirt.

978
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:14,537
Come down.

979
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,090
What a treasure!

980
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,900
It's a gold vault, too.

981
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:12,372
All these years of hard work are paying off.

982
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,565
Dad.

983
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:17,136
Aren't you looking for
the Bat's kung fu manuals here?

984
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:19,144
What are you doing here?

985
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:22,079
Nanny told me everything. I don't believe it.

986
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:25,675
I thought you had looked for the Blades
to find the kung fu manuals.

987
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:27,617
- I never thought...
- Silly girl.

988
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,587
Don't listen to the bullshit.

989
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,420
I've found the treasured vault.

990
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,857
Szma Villa will be the most reputed

991
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:39,455
and wealthiest family in the fighter's world.

992
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:42,729
It's a pity that you stopped at nothing
to get money.

993
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:45,599
Who brought you here?

994
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:46,900
I did.

995
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:48,364
You...

996
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,535
I didn't believe my father
is such a bad person.

997
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:54,513
I wanted them to see that my dad
actually came for the manuals.

998
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:57,049
See that he was trying to make
the fighter's world a better place.

999
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:00,416
I wanted them to see
that my father is a real hero.

1000
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,583
Hero?

1001
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,855
Hero?

1002
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,225
How much is a hero worth?

1003
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:17,237
When a man becomes old and weak,

1004
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:23,203
you'll know how much he is worth!

1005
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,037
I'll tell you the truth.

1006
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:31,212
In fact, 10 years ago,
I let the Bat kidnap you on purpose.

1007
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:36,288
So I can get the Bat Blade

1008
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,124
to find the treasured vault.

1009
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,615
You.

1010
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,426
But it's fine.

1011
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:46,523
I finally got what I wanted.

1012
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:48,067
Don't get closer.

1013
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:50,228
I just stroke a pressure point
on her shoulder.

1014
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,499
She can't move for a couple of hours.

1015
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,200
I didn't want her to interfere
when I killed you.

1016
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,269
You are all useless.

1017
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,778
You three shouldn't gloat just yet.

1018
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:38,008
You'll be dead in a minute.

1019
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,615
How could you be so confident?

1020
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:44,283
Because I'm holding the Bat Blade.

1021
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:08,378
The Blade is extremely sharp.
Everyone says so in the fighter's world.

1022
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:20,691
How could this sword...

1023
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,456
The Pearl Sword is the lethal weapon.

1024
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:23,825
It can counter the Bat Blade.

1025
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:00,867
The Venomous Wuxie.

1026
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,367
The Poisonous Doctor.

1027
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,937
What? You're still alive?

1028
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:14,673
Of course.

1029
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,215
If I was to die,

1030
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:19,445
all those years of hard work
would have been wasted.

1031
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:22,384
You are here for the treasured vault, too?

1032
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,216
Correct.

1033
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,227
We have the same kind of reputation

1034
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:31,889
as righteous gentlemen
in the fighter's world.

1035
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:35,530
We will do anything

1036
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:39,333
to cheat the treasure vault
from those so-called notorious scumbags.

1037
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,908
It's a pity
our plan wasn't completely successful.

1038
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:45,743
We both only have one Bat Blade.

1039
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:50,182
I realized later
you'd planned on getting to Ximen Luoye.

1040
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,349
So I turned your trick against you.

1041
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:55,422
I'd give the Blade to you,

1042
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:58,082
and you'd find the treasured vault for us.

1043
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:01,559
Now I come to get the treasure.

1044
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:07,362
You shameless bastard...

1045
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:09,697
Don't say that.

1046
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,902
From now on, both of us will be

1047
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:14,906
the most reputed gentlemen
in the world of martial arts.

1048
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:16,476
From now on,

1049
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:18,067
consider yourselves all to be dead.

1050
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:21,080
No one will ever know what happened here.

1051
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,813
I'll be a reputed gentlemen,

1052
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:25,713
just like before.

1053
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:28,815
Why are you so sure
we're going to die here today?

1054
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:32,825
Because the darts I threw here
a moment ago

1055
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:34,826
carried a very poisonous substance.

1056
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:37,056
It can make people go crazy.

1057
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,894
It will flow all over your body.

1058
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:42,834
When the poison starts reacting,

1059
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:46,763
you'll be laughing nonstop

1060
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,937
until you are dead.

1061
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:24,633
Your poison?

1062
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:27,009
The faster you move,
the faster the poison reacts.

1063
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:07,147
Your poison is really strong.

1064
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:08,778
- Get the vault.
- Yes.

1065
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,050
- Everyone, let's go.
- Go.

1066
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,053
Stop!

1067
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:17,991
- You.
- Me?

1068
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,690
I'm not poisoned.

1069
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,064
When you threw the darts,

1070
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:24,535
<i>I realized something was wrong</i>

1071
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:27,163
<i>I held my breath and covered my nose.</i>

1072
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:30,777
<i>When I saw you taking off your mask,
I knew it was safe to breathe.</i>

1073
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:33,472
Otherwise, as you said,

1074
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,876
I'd surely be dead now.

1075
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,347
Give me the antidote.

1076
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,081
- Don't give him...
- I...

1077
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:40,744
That's okay.

1078
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,344
I will. I will.

1079
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:47,557
You...

1080
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,026
Where's the antidote?

1081
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:01,463
- Kill those madmen first.
- Okay.

1082
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,181
- What happened?
- You were poisoned.

1083
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:31,780
Now we give the antidote
to Szma Zhongyuan.

1084
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,556
Stay back.

1085
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,530
What do you want?

1086
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:42,827
I'm giving you the antidote.

1087
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:02,513
Stay back.

1088
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:05,657
Look at this bottle.

1089
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:07,585
What?

1090
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:13,096
Yes, swallow it.

1091
01:28:15,524 --> 01:28:16,594
What?

1092
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:19,100
Swallow it?

1093
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:27,838
Yes, swallow it.

1094
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,527
They're trying to cheat us.

1095
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,863
They want to kill us.

1096
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,805
I won't be cheated by you.

1097
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:09,052
Brother, do you know who I am?

1098
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:10,312
Who?

1099
01:29:10,412 --> 01:29:12,824
I'm the Bat Without Wings.

1100
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:14,385
Really?

1101
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,991
I can fly, too.

1102
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:25,570
Can't you see I'm flying now?

1103
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:30,375
I'm flying, flying, flying.

1104
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:33,310
- Release Miss Szma's pressure point.
- Yes.

1105
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:38,178
Follow me.

1106
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:41,781
Hurry up.

1107
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,680
Look, I'm the Bat Without Wings.

1108
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:11,546
I can fly!

1109
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,484
Dad, don't jump!

1110
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:17,489
You don't believe that I can fly?

1111
01:30:18,113 --> 01:30:21,094
I'll show you that I can.

1112
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:26,530
I'm flying...

1113
01:30:29,691 --> 01:30:33,138
Dad!

1114
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,133
Dad!

1115
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:44,640
Dad!

1116
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:52,221
Dad. Dad.
