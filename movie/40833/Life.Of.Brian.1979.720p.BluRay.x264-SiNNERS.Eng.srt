1
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,300
- Who are you?
- We are three wise men.

2
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,180
- What?
- We are three wise men.

3
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,800
Well, what are you doing creeping around
a cow shed at 2:00 in the morning?

4
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,200
That doesn't sound
very wise to me.

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,970
- We are astrologers.
- We have come from the east.

6
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,300
Is this some kind of joke?

7
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,300
We wish to praise the infant.

8
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,300
We must pay homage to him.

9
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,720
Homage? You're drunk!
It's disgusting!

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Out the door! Out! Bashing me with
tales about Oriental fortunetellers.

11
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,180
- Come on, out!
- No, no. We must see him.

12
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,680
- Go and praise someone else's brat.
- We were led by a star.

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,890
Led by a bottle,
more like. Go on out.

14
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,050
We must see him.
We have brought presents.

15
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,390
- Out!
- Gold, frankincense, myrrh.

16
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,390
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.

17
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,680
Sorry the place
is a bit of a mess.

18
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,760
- Well, what is myrrh anyway?
- It is a valuable balm.

19
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,930
A balm? What are you giving him
a balm for? It might bite him.

20
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,180
- What?
- That's a dangerous animal.

21
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,510
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

22
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,300
- It's great big and
- No, it is an ointment.

23
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,640
Well, there is an animal
called a balm... or did I dream it?

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,050
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he, then?

25
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,930
- Hmm?
- What star sign is he?

26
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,390
- Well, Capricorn.
- Capricorn, eh? What are they like?

27
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,970
He is the Son of God,
our Messiah.

28
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,970
King of the Jews!

29
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,350
- That's Capricorn, is it?
- No, that's just him.

30
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,640
Oh, I was gonna say, otherwise
there would be a lot of them.

31
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,930
- By what name are you calling him?
- Uh, Brian.

32
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,680
We worship you, O Brian,
who are lord over us all.

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,050
Praise unto you, Brian, and
to the Lord, our Father. Amen.

34
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,220
- You do a lot of this, then?
- What?

35
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,390
- This praising.
- No, no, no, no.

36
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,430
Well, if you're
dropping by again, do pop in.

37
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,140
And thanks a lot for
the gold and frankincense.

38
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,680
But don't worry too much
about the myrrh next time, all right?

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,180
Thank you.
Goodbye.

40
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,350
Well, weren't they nice?

41
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,800
Out of their bloody minds,
but still... Iook at that!

42
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,300
Here! Here!

43
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,430
That That's mine!
Hey, he's a baby! Oh!

44
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,300
- Shut up!

45
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,680
<i>Brian</i>

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,800

<i>A boy called Brian</i>

53

<i>He had arms and legs</i>

54
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,390
<i>And hands and feet</i>

<i>Whose name was Brian</i>

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,470

<i>A teenager called Brian</i>

<i>And his face became spotty</i>

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,510
<i>Yes, his face became spotty</i>

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,010
<i>And his voice
dropped down low</i>

66
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,470
<i>And things started to grow</i>

67
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,720
<i>On young Brian and show</i>

68
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,600

<i>Not a girl named Brian</i>

<i>Bri</i>

80
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,890
- Aah!

81
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,850
How blessed are those who know
that He's a god.

82
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,470
How blessed are the sorrowful.
They shall find consolation.

83
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,600
How blessed are those
of gentle spirit.

84
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
They shall have the earth
for their possession.

85
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,180
How blessed are those
who hunger and thirst...

86
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,050
to see right prevail.

87
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,720
They shall be satisfied.

88
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,180
How blessed are those
whose hearts are pure.

89
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,800
They shall see God.

90
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,970
- Speak up!
- Shhh. Quiet, Mum.

91
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,800
Well, I can't hear a thing.
Let's go to the stoning.

92
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,720
- Shhh!
- We can go to a stoning anytime.

93
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,300
- Oh, come on, Brian.
- Will you be quiet?

94
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,550
Don't pick your nose.

95
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,140
I wasn't picking my nose.
I was scratching.

96
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,850
You was picking it
while you was talking to that lady.

97
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,350
- I wasn't.
- Leave it alone. Give it a rest.

98
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,050
Do you mind?
I can't hear a word he's saying.

99
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,640
Don't you "do you mind" me!
I was talking to my husband.

100
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,140
Well, go and talk to him somewhere else.
I can't hear a bloody thing.

101
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Don't you swear at my wife.

102
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,470
I was only asking her to shut up so
we can hear what he's saying, Big Nose.

103
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,010
- Don't you call my husband "Big Nose."
- Well, he has got a big nose.

104
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,350
Could you be quiet, please?
What was that?

105
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,760
I was too busy
talking to Big Nose.

106
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,640
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers."

107
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,720
What's so special
about the cheese makers?

108
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,430
Well, obviously, it's not meant
to be taken literally.

109
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,260
It refers to any manufacturers
of dairy products.

110
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,180
See, if you hadn't been going on,
we'd have heard that, Big Nose.

111
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,180
Hey! Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in.

112
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,600
Better keep listening. Might be a bit
about, "Blessed are the Big Noses."

113
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh, lay off him.

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,720
Oh, you're not so bad
yourself, Conch Face.

115
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,970
Where are you two from,
Nose City?

116
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,970
One more time, mate, I'll
take you to fuckin' cleaners!

117
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,390
Language!
And don't pick your nose.

118
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,140
I wasn't gonna pick my nose.
I was gonna thump him!

119
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,100
- Hear that? "Blessed are the Greek."
- The Greek?

120
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,680
Well, apparently
he's going to inherit the earth.

121
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,600
- Did anyone catch his name?
- You're not gonna thump anybody.

122
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,470
I'll thump him
if he calls me "Big Nose" again.

123
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,640
- Oh, shut up, Big Nose.
- Oh! Right. I warned you.

124
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,470
- I really will slug you so hard
- Oh, it's the meek!

125
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,390
"Blessed are the meek"!
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?

126
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,430
I'm glad they're getting something,
'cause they have a hell of a time.

127
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,180
Listen, I'm only telling the truth.
You have got a very big nose.

128
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,010
Hey, your nose gonna be three foot wide
across your face when I'm finished!

129
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,140
- Shhh!
- Who hit yours, then?
Goliath's big brother?

130
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,470
Oh. Right.
That's your last warning.

131
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,680
Oh, do pipe down.

132
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Silly bitch.
Get in the way on me.

133
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,260
Oh, come on.
Let's go to the stoning.

134
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,470
All right.

135
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,800
Blessed is just about anyone with
a vested interest in the status quo.

136
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,600
Well, what Jesus fails to appreciate
is it's the meek who are the problem.

137
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,720
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg.
Yes, I see.

138
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,180
Oh, come on, Brian. They're gonna
stone him before we get there.

139
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,100
All right.

140
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,260
- That's disgusting.

141
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,100
It's the chap with a big nose's fault.
He started it all.

142
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,720
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.

143
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,720
Why aren't women allowed
to go to stonings, Mum?

144
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,930
It's written, that's why.

145
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,720
Beard, madame?

146
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,430
Oh, look, I haven't got time
to go to no stonings.

147
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,430
He's not well again.

148
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,640
- Stone, sir?

149
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,260
No, they got them up there,
lying around on the ground.

150
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,720
Oh, not like these, sir.
Look at this.

151
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,470
Feel the quality of that.
That's craftsmanship, sir.

152
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,300
Well, all right. We'll have two
with points and a big, flat one.

153
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,510
- Can I have a flat one, Mum?
- Shhh!

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,510
- Sorry. Dad.
- All right.

155
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,510
Two points, two flats
and a packet of gravel.

156
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,970
Packet of gravel. Should be
a good one this afternoon.

157
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,680
- Who?
- Local boy.

158
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,470
- Oh, good.
- Enjoy yourselves.

159
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,050
Matthias, son
of Deuteronomy of Gath?

160
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,430
- Do I say yes? Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,140
You have been found guilty
by the elders of the town...

162
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,300
of uttering
the name of our Lord.

163
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,180
- And so as a blasphemer...

164
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,970
you are to be stoned to death.

165
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,390
- Look, I'd had a lovely supper,

166
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,600
and all I said to my wife was,

167
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,390
"That piece of halibut
was good enough for Jehovah."

168
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,640
- Blasphemy! He said it again!

169
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,300
- Did you hear him?

170
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,510
Really!

171
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,640
Are there any women
here today?

172
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,680
Very well. By virtue
of the authority vested in me

173
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,800
Ow! Lay off!
We haven't started yet!

174
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,970
Come on!
Who threw that?

175
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,640
Who threw that stone?
Come on.

176
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,800
She did! She did!

177
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,970
He did! He did!

178
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,300
Sorry. I thought
we'd started.

179
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,640
- Go to the back.

180
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,430
Always one, isn't there?
Now, where were we?

181
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,180
Look, I don't think it ought to be
blasphemy, just saying "Jehovah."

182
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,390
- You're only making it
worse for yourself.

183
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,470
Making it worse?
How could it be worse?

184
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,180
- Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!

185
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,140
I'm warning you, if you say
"Jehovah" once more

186
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,300
Right.
Who threw that?

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,010
Come on.
Who threw that?

188
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,300
Him, him, him.

189
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,300
- Was it you?
- Yes.

190
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,300
- Right
- Well, you did say "Jehovah."

191
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,470
Stop! Will you stop that?

192
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,470
Stop it! Now, look!
No one is to stone anyone...

193
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,760
until I blow this whistle.

194
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,350
Do you understand? Even and I want
to make this absolutely clear

195
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,800
Even if they do say "Jehovah."

196
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,430
Good shot! Bravo!

197
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,390
- Have I got a big nose, Mum?
- Oh, stop thinking about sex.

198
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,010
- I wasn't!
- You're always on about it,
morning, noon and night.

199
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,930
"Will the girls like this?
Will the girls like that?

200
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,680
Is it too big?
ls it too small?"

201
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,970
Here you are, mate.

202
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,220
- Bless you, sir.
- Alms for the poor.

203
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,680
- Alms for a leper.
- Alms for an exleper.

204
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,720
Bloody donkey owners.
All the same, ain't they?

205
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,300
Never have any change.
Oh, here's a touch.

206
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,850
- Spare a talent for an old exleper?
- Buzz off!

207
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,260
Spare a talent
for an old exleper?

208
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,050
A talent?
That's more than he earns in a month!

209
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,220
- Half a talent, then.
- Now, go away!

210
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,680
- Come on, Big Nose, let's haggle.
- What?

211
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,260
You open at one shekel.
I start at 2,000. We close about 1,800.

212
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,260
- No.
- 1,750?

213
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
- Go away!
- 1,740?

214
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,960
- Leave him alone!
- All right, two shekels.
Isn't this fun, eh?

215
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,460
Look, he's not giving you
any money, so piss off!

216
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,340
- All right. Half a shekel
for an old exleper?
- Did you say "exleper"?

217
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,130
Sixteen years behind the bell,
and proud of it, sir.

218
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,840
- Well, what happened?
- I were cured, sir.

219
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,210
- Cured?
- Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.

220
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,050
- Well, who cured you?
- Jesus did, sir.

221
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,630
I was hopping along,
minding my own business.

222
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,090
All of a sudden,
up he comes, cures me!

223
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,130
One minute,
I'm a leper with a trade;

224
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,250
next minute,
my livelihood's gone.

225
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,000
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody dogooder.

226
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,670
Well, why don't you go and tell him
that you want to be a leper again?

227
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,420
I could do that, sir.
Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.

228
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,210
I was gonna ask him if he'd
make me a bit lame in one leg
during the middle of the week.

229
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,880
You know, something beggable but not
leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.

230
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,670
Brian! Come and clean
your room out!

231
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,840
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir. Thank

232
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,750
Half a denary?
Me bloody life story.

233
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,960
There's no pleasing
some people.

234
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,090
That's just
what Jesus said, sir.

235
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,880
- Oh!
- Good afternoon.

236
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Oh, uh, hello, officer.

237
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,340
I'll be with you in a few
moments, all right, dear?

238
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,130
- What's he doing here?
- Don't start that, Brian.
Go and clean your room out.

239
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,710
- Bloody Romans!
- Now look, Brian.

240
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,340
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't have all this.

241
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,840
- And don't you forget it.
- We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum.

242
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,500
- Well, that's not entirely true.
- What do you mean?

243
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,670
- Well, you know you were
asking me about your
- My nose?

244
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,920
Yes. Well, there's a reason
it's like it is, Brian.

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,920
What is it?

246
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,880
Well, I suppose I should've
told you a long time ago

247
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,210
- What?
- Well, Brian...

248
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,420
your father
isn't Mr. Cohen.

249
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,380
- Well, I never thought he was.
- None of your cheek!

250
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,840
He was a Roman, Brian.

251
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,960
He was a centurion
in the Roman army.

252
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,130
- You mean you were raped?
- Well, at first, yes.

253
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,170
- Who was it?
- Naughtius Maximus, his name was.

254
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,800
Promised me
the known world, he did.

255
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,750
I was to be taken to Rome,
housed by the Forum

256
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,000
slaves, asses' milk,

257
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,380
as much gold as I could eat.

258
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,960
Then he, having his way
with me, he had

259
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,210
- Vroom, like a rat out of an aqueduct!
- The bastard!

260
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,500
Yeah, so next time you go on
about the bloody Romans,

261
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,500
don't forget
you're one of 'em!

262
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,710
I'm not a Roman, Mum!
And I never will be!

263
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,710
I'm a kike, a Yid,
a hebe, a hooknose!

264
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,630
I'm kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea
pedestrian, and proud of it!

265
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,800
Sex, sex, sex. That's all
they think about, huh?

266
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,130
Well, how are you,
then, officer?

267
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,170
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest...

268
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,170
is between...

269
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,920
Frank Goliath,
the Macedonian babycrusher,

270
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,670
and Boris Mineburg.

271
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,300
Larks' tongues.
Wren's livers.

272
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,710
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.

273
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,630
Wolf's nipple chips. Get 'em
while they're hot. They're lovely.

274
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,300
Dromedary pretzels, only half a denar.
Tuscany fried bats.

275
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,250
I do feel, Reg, that any
antilmperialist group like ours...

276
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,300
must reflect such a divergence
of interest within its power base.

277
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,090
- Oh, great. Francis?
- Yeah, I think Judith's point
of view is very valid, Reg,

278
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,130
provided the movement
never forgets...

279
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,590
- that it is the inalienable
right of every man
- Or woman.

280
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,250
or woman
to rid himself

281
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,090
- Or herself.
- or herself

282
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,920
- Agreed.
- Thank you, brother.

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,920
- Or sister.
- Or sister.

284
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,920
- Where was I?

285
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,920
- I think you finished.
- Oh, right.

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,840
Furthermore, it is
the birthright of every man

287
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,920
- Or woman.
- Why don't you shut up about women?

288
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,170
Women have a perfect right
to play a part in our movement.

289
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,500
Why are you always on
about women, Stan?

290
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,170
I want to be one.

291
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,420
- What?
- I want to be a woman.

292
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,460
From now on, I want you all
to call me "Loretta."

293
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,750
- What?
- It's my right as a man.

294
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,500
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

295
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,170
I want to have babies.

296
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,840
You want to have babies?

297
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,590
It's every man's right
to have babies if he wants them.

298
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,460
- But you can't have babies.
- Don't you oppress me.

299
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,960
I'm not oppressing you.
You haven't got a womb.

300
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,090
Where is the fetus
gonna gestate?

301
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,590
You're gonna keep it
in a box?

302
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,590
Here, I've got an idea.

303
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,340
Suppose you agree that
he can't actually have babies,

304
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,670
not having a womb which is
nobody's fault, not even the Romans'

305
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,670
but that he can have
the right to have babies?

306
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,500
Good idea, Judith.
We shall fight the oppressors...

307
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,710
for your right to have
babies, brother

308
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,550
- Sister. Sorry.
- What's the point?

309
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,840
- What?
- What's the point of fighting
for his right to have babies...

310
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,250
when he can't have babies?

311
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,840
It is symbolic of our
struggle against oppression.

312
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,460
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

313
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,840
It's dangerous out there.

314
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,840
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelot spleens.

315
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,130
- Got any nuts?
- Haven't got any nuts. Sorry.

316
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,590
- I've got wrens' livers,
badger spleens
- No, no, no.

317
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,210
- Otters' noses?
- I don't want that Roman rubbish!

318
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,500
- Why don't you sell proper food?
- Proper food?

319
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,300
Yeah, and not those rich,
lmperialist tidbits.

320
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,500
Well, don't blame me.
I didn't ask to sell this stuff.

321
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,670
All right.
Bag of otters' noses, then.

322
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,500
- Make it two. Thanks, Reg.
- Two.

323
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,340
- Are you the Judean People's Front?
- Fuck off!

324
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,460
- What?
- Judean People's Front!

325
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,800
We're the People's Front of Judea!

326
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,630
- Judean People's Front!
- Wankers.

327
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,050
- Can I join your group?
- No. Piss off.

328
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,920
I didn't want to sell
this stuff. It's only a job.

329
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,630
- I hate the Romans as much as anybody!
- Shhh. Shhh!

330
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,130
- Are you sure?
- Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans.

331
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,630
Listen, if you wanted
to join the P.F.J.,

332
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,670
you'd have to really
hate the Romans.

333
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,710
- I do.
- Oh, yeah? How much?

334
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
A lot.

335
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,170
Right. You're in.

336
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,210
Listen. The only people
we hate more than the Romans...

337
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,590
are the fuckin'
Judean People's Front.

338
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,250
- Yeah!
- Splitters!

339
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,250
- And the Judean Popular People's Front.
- Oh, yeah! Splitters!

340
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,000
- And the People's Front of Judea.
- Splitters!

341
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,550
- What?
- The People's Front of Judea.

342
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,170
We're the People's Front of Judea!

343
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,250
Oh. I thought we were
the Popular Front.

344
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,670
People's Front!

345
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,840
- What happened to the Popular Front?
- He's over there.

346
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,300
Splitter!

347
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:15,090
Oh! I think I'm about
to have a cardiac arrest.

348
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,210
- Absolutely dreadful.

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,420
Brother! Haha!
What's your name?

350
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,050
Brian. Brian Cohen.

351
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,420
We may have a little job
for you, Brian.

352
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,710
What's this, then?
"Romanes eunt domus"?

353
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,880
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

354
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,130
Ilt says "Romans, go home."

355
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,300
No, it doesn't.
What's Latin for "Roman"?

356
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,460
- Come on!
- "Romanes"?

357
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,500
- Goes like?
- "Annus"?

358
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,840
- Vocative plural of "annus" is?
- "Anni"?

359
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,670
- "Romani."

360
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,340
- "Eunt"? What is "eunt"?
- "Go."

361
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,500
Conjugate the verb "to go."

362
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,960
"lre, eo, is, it,
imus, itis, eunt."

363
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,050
So "eunt" is?

364
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,800
Third person plural,
present indicative. "They go."

365
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,550
But "Romans, go home" is
an order, so you must use the

366
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,800
- The imperative.
- Which is?

367
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,960
Um, oh, oh, "i."

368
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,550
- How many Romans?
- Aah! Plural, plural.

369
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,500
- "lte."
- "lte."

370
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,750
- "Domus"? Nominative?

371
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,960
"Go home." This is motion
towards, isn't it, Brian?

372
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,960
Dative!

373
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,090
No, not dative!

374
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,590
Accusative, accusative!

375
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,090
- "Domum," sir. "Ad domum."
- Except when "domus" takes the

376
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,130
- Locative, sir.
- Which is?

377
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,380
- "Domum."
- "Domum."

378
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,630
- "Um."

379
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,630
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

380
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,000
Now, write it out 100 times.

381
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,550
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar, sir.

382
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,500
Hail Caesar. If it's not done
by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.

383
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.

384
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,200
Finished!

385
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,700
Right. Now,
don't do it again.

386
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,750
Hey, bloody Romans!

387
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,750
We're gettin' in through the
underground heating system here,

388
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,660
up through into the main
audience chamber here,

389
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,910
and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

390
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,370
Having grabbed his wife, we inform
Pilate that she is in our custody...

391
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,750
and forthwith issue our demands.

392
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,790
- Any questions?
- What exactly are the demands?

393
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,950
We're giving Pilate
two days to dismantle...

394
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,540
the entire apparatus of
the Roman lmperialist State,

395
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,910
and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

396
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,950
- Cut her head off?
- Cut all her bits off.

397
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,000
Send them back
on the hour, every hour.

398
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,790
And, of course, we point out
that they bear...

399
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,330
full responsibility
when we chop her up...

400
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,540
and that we shall not submit
to blackmail.

401
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,870
No blackmail!

402
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,620
They bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.

403
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,410
And not just from us. From our fathers
and from our fathers' fathers.

404
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,830
And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
Yeah.

405
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,540
- And from our fathers'
fathers' fathers' fathers.
- Don't labor the point.

406
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,160
And what have they ever
given us in return?

407
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,830
- The aqueduct.
- What?

408
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,000
The aqueduct.

409
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They did give us that.

410
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,700
And the sanitation.

411
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,290
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

412
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,120
Yeah, I'll grant you,
the aqueduct and sanitation are
two things the Romans have done.

413
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,120
- And the roads.
- Well, obviously the roads.

414
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,700
I mean, the roads go
without saying, don't they?

415
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,750
But apart from the sanitation,
the aqueduct and the roads

416
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,660
- lrrigation.
- Medicine.

417
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,200
- Education.
- Yeah, all right. Fair enough.

418
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,330
- And the wine.

419
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,620
Yeah, that's something we'd really miss,
Reg, if the Romans left.

420
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,500
- Public baths.
- And it's safe to walk
in the streets at night.

421
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,370
Yeah, they certainly keep order.
They're the only ones who could
in a place like this.

422
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,450
All right, but apart from
the sanitation, the medicine,

423
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,700
education, wine, public order,
irrigation, roads,

424
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,330
the fresh water system
and public health,

425
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,700
what have the Romans
ever done for us?

426
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,700
- Brought peace.
- Oh, peace! Shut up!

427
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,500
I'm a poor man.
My sight is poor.

428
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,830
My legs are old and bent.

429
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,910
It's all right, Matthias.

430
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,040
It's all clear.

431
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,290
Well, where's Reg?

432
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,580
Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.

433
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,660
- What went wrong?
- The first blow has been struck.

434
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,910
- Did he finish the slogan?
- A hundred times,

435
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
in letters ten foot high,
all the way around the palace.

436
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,790
Oh, great. Great.

437
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,750
We We need doers
in our movement, Brian,

438
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,290
but before you join us, know this:

439
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,950
There is not one of us who
would not gladly suffer death...

440
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,450
to rid this country of
the Romans once and for all.

441
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,790
- Oh, yeah, there's one.

442
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,200
But otherwise, we're solid.
Are you with us?

443
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,950
Yes.

444
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,790
From now on you shall be called
"Brian that is called Brian."

445
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,830
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

446
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,870
Right.
This is the plan.

447
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,540
Now, this is the palace
on Caesar's Square.

448
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,410
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street under cover of night...

449
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,040
and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.

450
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,120
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.

451
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,750
Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the P.F.J.,

452
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,330
will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head,

453
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,620
though he himself will not be taking
part in any terrorist action...

454
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,620
as he has a bad back.

455
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,870
- Aren't you going to come with us?
- Solidarity, brother.

456
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,700
Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.

457
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,910
Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.

458
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,160
There is a Roman feast later
in the evening, so you must move fast.

459
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,200
And don't wear
your best sandals.

460
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,000
Turning left here, we enter the
CaesarAugustus memorial sewer,

461
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,790
and from there proceed
directly to the hypocaust.

462
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,700
This has just been retiled. So,
terrorists, careful with those weapons.

463
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:50,500
We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself.

464
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,830
This is the moment for Habbakuk
to get out his prong.

465
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,790
Shhh. Shhh.

466
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,580
Campaign for Free Galilee.

467
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,750
Oh, uh, People's Front
of Judea. Officials.

468
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,540
- Oh.
- What's your group doing here?

469
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,750
We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife,
take her back, issue demands.

470
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,750
- So are we. That's our plan.
- What?

471
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,330
- We were here first.
- What do you mean?

472
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,700
- We thought of it first.
- We did!

473
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,330
Yes, a couple of years ago.
We did!

474
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,750
Come on. You got all your demands
worked out, then?

475
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,000
- Of course we have.
- What are they?

476
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,540
- Well, I'm not telling you.
- Oh, come on!

477
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,370
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

478
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,370
- Did not!
- We did!

479
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,580
You bastards, we've been
planning this for months.

480
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,870
Well, tough pity for you,
Fish Face. Oh!

481
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,700
Brothers, we should
be struggling together.

482
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,370
- We mustn't fight each other.

483
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,870
Surely, we should be united
against the common enemy.

484
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,410
The Judean People's Front!

485
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,910
No, no, the Romans!

486
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,410
Oh, yeah, yeah.

487
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,080
Yeah, he's right.

488
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,660
- Right. Where were we?
- You were gonna punch me.

489
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,080
Brothers!

490
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,200
What

491
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,450
You lucky bastard.

492
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,500
Who's that?

493
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
You lucky, lucky bastard.

494
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,950
What?
Quite the little jailer's pet, are we?

495
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,500
- What do you mean?
- You must've slipped him a few shekels.

496
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face.

497
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,870
Oh, what wouldn't I give
to be spat at in the face!

498
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,580
I sometimes hang awake at night
dreaming of being spat at in the face.

499
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,540
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They have me in manacles.

500
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,040
Manacles?

501
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,830
My idea of heaven is to be
allowed to be put in manacles...

502
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,000
just for a few hours.

503
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,200
They must think the sun shines
out of your ass, son.

504
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,330
Oh, lay off me!
I've had a hard time!

505
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,660
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years.

506
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,040
They only hung me the right way
up yesterday, so don't you

507
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,500
All right, all right.

508
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,370
They must think
you're Lord God Almighty.

509
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,200
- What will they do to me?
- Oh, you'll probably
get away with crucifixion.

510
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,370
- Crucifixion?
- Yeah, first offense.

511
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,540
Get away with crucifixion?
It's

512
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,450
- Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
- What?

513
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,910
Oh, yeah, if we didn't have crucifixion,
this country'd be in a bloody mess.

514
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,870
- Guard!
- Nail him up, I say!

515
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,040
- Guard!
- Nail some sense into him!

516
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
What do you want?

517
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,410
- I want you to move me to another cell.

518
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,910
- Aah!
- Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism.

519
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,910
- Shut up, you!
- Sorry.

520
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,200
Now take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.

521
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,250
Every night, they take me down for
20 minutes, then they hang me up again,

522
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,370
which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

523
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,200
And if nothing else, it's
taught me to respect the Romans,

524
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,200
and it's taught me that you'll
never get anywhere in this life...

525
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,700
unless you're prepared to do
a fair day's work for a fair day's

526
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,330
Oh, shut up!

527
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,410
- Here.
- Pilate wants to see you.

528
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,450
- Me?
- Come on!

529
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,700
Pilate? What's he want
to see me for?

530
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,750
I think he wants to know which way up
you want to be crucified.

531
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,200
Nice one, centurion. Like it.

532
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,580
- Shut up!
- Right, right.

533
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,540
Terrific race, the Romans.
Terrific!

534
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,950
- Hail Caesar.
- Hail.

535
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,750
- Only one survivor, sir.
- Oh. "Thwow" him to the floor.

536
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,000
- What's that?
- Throw him to the floor.

537
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Oh.

538
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,250
Now, what is
your name, Jew?

539
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,250
- Brian, sir.
- "Bwian," eh?

540
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,200
No, no. Brian.

541
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,500
- Aah!

542
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,500
The little rascal
has "spiwit."

543
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,870
- Has what, sir?
- "Spiwit."

544
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,040
Yes, he did, sir.

545
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,450
No, no. "Spiwit," "bwavado,"
a touch of "dewwingdo."

546
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,040
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.

547
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,200
So, you dare to "waid" us?

548
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,250
To what, sir?

549
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,750
"Stwike" him, centurion,
very "woughly."

550
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,200
- Aah!
- And "thwow" him to the floor, sir?

551
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,830
- What?
- "Thwow" him to the floor again, sir?

552
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,910
Oh, yes, "thwow" him
to the floor, please.

553
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,830
- Aah!
- Now, Jewish "wapscallion"

554
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,040
I'm not Jewish.
I'm a Roman.

555
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,040
- A "Woman"?
- No, no. Roman.

556
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,040
Aah!

557
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,080
So, your father was
a "Woman." Who was he?

558
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,870
He was a centurion
in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.

559
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,120
Really?
What was his name?

560
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,500
- "Naughtius Maximus."

561
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,030
Centurion, do you have
anyone of that name in the garrison?

562
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,240
Well, no, sir.

563
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,490
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?

564
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,360
Well, no, sir.
I think it's a joke, sir.

565
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:16,570
Like, uh, "Sillius Soddus"
or "Biggus Dickus," sir.

566
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,650
What's funny
about "Biggus Dickus"?

567
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,070
Well, it's a joke name, sir.

568
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,530
I have a very great
friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.

569
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,320
Silence!
What is all this insolence?

570
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,820
You will find yourself
in gladiator school "vewy" quickly...

571
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,820
with "wotten" behavior like that.

572
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,280
Can I go now, sir?
Aaah!

573
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,820
Wait till Biggus Dickus
hears of this.

574
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,200
- "Wight"! Take him away!

575
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,860
- Oh, sir, he
- I want him fighting wild,
"wabid" animals within a week.

576
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,780
Yes, sir.
Come on, you.

577
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,650
I will not have my friends
"widiculed" by the common "soldiewy."

578
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,070
Anyone else feel like
a little giggle...

579
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,740
when I mention my "fwiend,"

580
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,030
- Biggus...

581
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,200
- Dickus?

582
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:29,820
What about you?
Do you find it "wisible"...

583
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,610
when I say the name...

584
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,320
Biggus... Dickus?

585
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,700
He has a wife, you know?

586
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,450
You know what she's called?

587
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:11,280
She's called "lncontinentia."

588
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,240
- "lncontinentia Buttocks."

589
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,610
Shut up!
What is all this?

590
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,950
I've had enough of this
"wowdy," "webel" behavior!

591
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,780
- Silence! Quiet!
"Pwaetowian" guards!

592
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,650
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!

593
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,200
Hmm? Hmm.

594
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,200
Oh, you lucky bastard.

595
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,990
And the bezan
shall be huge and black...

596
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:53,610
And the eyes thereof red with
the blood of living creatures!

597
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,530
And the whore of Babylon...

598
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,820
shall ride forth
on a threeheaded serpent!

599
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,820
And throughout the lands
there'll be a great rubbing of parts.

600
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,320
The demon shall bear
a ninebladed sword.

601
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,900
Ninebladed not two
or five or seven, but nine

602
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,700
which he will wield on all wretched
sinners, just like you, sir, there.

603
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,950
And the whoring shall be
on the head of Addius.

604
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:28,450
There shall in that time
be rumors of things going astray,

605
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,990
um, and there shall be a great confusion
as to where things really are.

606
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,070
And nobody will really know
where lieth...

607
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,700
those little things...

608
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,990
with the sort of raffia work
base that has an attachment.

609
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:46,820
At this time, a friend
shall lose his friend's hammer,

610
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,700
and the young shall not know
where lieth...

611
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,030
the things possessed
by their fathers...

612
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,780
that their fathers put there
only just the night before about 8:00.

613
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,650
Yea, it is written
in the Book of Cyril...

614
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,150
in that time

615
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,200
How much, quick?
It's for the wife.

616
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,280
- Oh, uh, 20 shekels.
- Right.

617
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,400
- What?
- There you are.

618
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,400
- Wait a minute.
- What?

619
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,860
- We're supposed to haggle.
- No, no, no. I've got to get

620
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,860
- What do you mean, no?
- I haven't got time.

621
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,400
- Well, give it back, then.
- No, no. I just paid you.

622
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,860
- Burt, this bloke won't haggle.
- Won't haggle?

623
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,030
All right.
Do we have to?

624
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,780
- I want 20 for that.
- I just gave you 20.

625
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,570
- Are you telling me
that's not worth 20 shekels?
- No.

626
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,070
- Feel the quality.
That's none of your goat.
- I'll give you 19, then.

627
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,150
- No, no, no. Do it properly.
- What?

628
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,610
- Haggle properly. This isn't worth 19.
- You just said it was worth 20.

629
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,450
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Come on, haggle.

630
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,990
- All right, I'll give you ten.
- That's more like it.

631
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:57,200
Ten? Are you
trying to insult me?

632
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,070
Me with a poor, dying
grandmother? Ten?

633
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,990
- All right, I'll give you 11.
- Now you're gettin' it.

634
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:07,450
Did I hear you right? Eleven?
This cost me 12. You want to ruin me?

635
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,200
- Seventeen?
- No, no, no, no. Seventeen.

636
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,780
- Eighteen.
- No, no. You go to 14 now.

637
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,700
- All right, I'll give you 14.
- Fourteen? Are you joking?

638
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,070
- That's what you told me to say!
- Oh, dear.

639
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,450
Oh, tell me
what to say, please!

640
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,490
- Offer me 14.
- I'll give you 14.

641
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,610
- He's offering me 14 for this!
- Fifteen!

642
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,030
Seventeen. My last word. I won't take
a penny less, or strike me dead.

643
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,950
- Sixteen.
- Done.

644
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,070
Nice to do business with you.

645
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,110
- I'll throw you in this as well.
- I don't want it, but thanks.

646
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,450
- Burt.
- All right, all right.

647
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,240
- Now, where's the 16 you owe me?
- I just gave you 20.

648
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,070
- Right. That's four I owe you, then.
- That's right. That's fine.

649
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,530
- I've got it here somewhere.
- That's four for the gourd.

650
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,240
Four? For this gourd?

651
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,150
Look at it! It's worth ten
if it's worth a shekel.

652
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,490
- You gave it to me for nothing.
- Yes, but it's worth ten.

653
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,360
All right, all right.

654
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,280
No, no, no, no.
It's not worth ten.

655
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,990
You're supposed to argue.
"Ten for that? You must be mad."

656
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,110
Oh, well.
One born every minute.

657
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,150
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

658
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,400
- Job.
- Job.

659
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,570
- Joshua.
- Joshua.

660
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,950
- Judges.
- Judges.

661
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:23,700
- And Brian.
- And Brian.

662
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,110
I now propose that all seven
of these exbrothers...

663
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,650
be now entered in the minutes
as probationary martyrs to the cause.

664
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,200
- I second that, Reg.
- Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.

665
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,450
Siblings, let us not
be down on it.

666
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,900
One total catastrophe like this...

667
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,780
is just the beginning!

668
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,780
Their glorious deaths
shall unite us all in

669
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,780
Look out!

670
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,610
Hello?

671
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,780
Matthias?

672
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,150
- Reg?
- Go away.

673
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,820
Reg, it's me, Brian.

674
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,990
Get off!
Get off out of it!

675
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,030
- Stan!
- Piss off.

676
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,950
- Yeah, piss off.
- Bugger off.

677
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,110
Oh, shit!

678
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,110
Coming.

679
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,490
Yea, verily at that time it is
written in the book of Obadiah,

680
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:37,490
a man shall strike his donkey
and his nephew's donkey.

681
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,650
My eyes are dim.
I cannot see.

682
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,200
- Are you Matthias?
- Yes.

683
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,200
We have reason to believe
you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth,

684
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,450
a member of the terrorist organization,
the People's Front of Judea.

685
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:55,280
Me? No.
I'm just a poor old man.

686
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,360
I have no time
for lawbreakers.

687
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,780
My legs are grey.
My ears are nulled.

688
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,860
My eyes are old and bent.

689
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,990
Quiet!
Silly person.

690
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,150
Guards, search the house.

691
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,150
You know the penalty
laid down by Roman law...

692
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,240
for harboring
a known criminal?

693
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,240
- No.
- Crucifixion.

694
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,570
Oh.

695
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,280
- Nasty, eh?
- Could be worse.

696
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,780
What do you mean,
"Could be worse"?

697
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,070
Well, you could be stabbed.

698
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,610
Stabbed? Takes a second.
Crucifixion lasts hours.

699
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,280
It's a slow, horrible death.

700
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,530
Well, at least it gets you
out in the open air.

701
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,740
You're weird.

702
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,320
No, sir.
Couldn't find anything, sir.

703
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,610
Well, don't worry.
You've not seen the last of us, weirdo.

704
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,150
- Big Nose.
- Watch it!

705
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,570
Whew, that was lucky.

706
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,700
I'm sorry, Reg.

707
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,030
Oh, it's all right.
He's sorry.

708
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,820
He's sorry he led the Fifth Legion
straight to our headquarters.

709
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,740
Well, that's all right,
then, Brian. Sit down.

710
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,360
Have a scone.
Make yourself at home. You klutz!

711
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,900
You stupid, birdbrained,
flatheaded

712
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,650
- My legs are old and bent.

713
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,650
My ears are grizzled. Yes?

714
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,900
There's one place
we didn't look. Guards!

715
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:50,070
- I'm just a poor old man.

716
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,070
My nose is knackered.

717
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,570
Have you ever seen
anyone crucified?

718
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,990
Crucifixion's a doddle.

719
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,990
Don't keep saying that.

720
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,920
Found this spoon, sir.

721
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,210
Well done, sergeant.

722
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,800
We'll be back, oddball.

723
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,940
Open up!

724
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,560
You haven't given us
time to hide.

725
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,440
- ln that time
- The serpent, he shall strike you

726
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,980
- Holes from every bitch
you got germs from
- Jumbo jets

727
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,540
Don't pass judgement
on other people...

728
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,700
or you might
get judged yourself.

729
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,410
- What?
- I said, don't pass
judgement on other people...

730
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,200
or else you might
get judged too.

731
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,160
- Who, me?
- Yes.

732
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,370
- Thank you very much.
- Not just you. All of you.

733
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,790
- That's a nice gourd.
- What?

734
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,330
- How much do you want for the gourd?
- You can have it.

735
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,160
- Have it?
- Yes. Consider the lilies.

736
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,450
- Don't you want to haggle?
- No. In the field.

737
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,750
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing. Take it.

738
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,950
- Consider the lilies?
- Well, the birds, then.

739
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,950
- What birds?
- Any birds.

740
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,580
- Why?
- Well, have they got jobs?

741
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,580
- Who?
- The birds.

742
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,580
Have the birds got jobs?

743
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,200
- What's the matter with him?
- Says the birds are scrounging.

744
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,200
The point is, the birds,
they do all right, don't they?

745
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,080
- Well, good luck to 'em.
- Yeah, they're very pretty.

746
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,120
Okay. And you're much more
important than they are, right?

747
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,950
So what are you worrying about?
There you are. See?

748
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,660
I'm worrying about what
you've got against birds.

749
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,830
I haven't got anything
against the birds.

750
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,870
- Consider the lilies.
- He's having a go at the flowers now!

751
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,870
- Give the flowers a chance.
- I'll give you one for it.

752
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:55,120
- It's yours.
- Two, then.

753
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,500
Look, there was this man,
and he had two servants.

754
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,290
What were they called?
What were their names?

755
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,870
I don't know.
And he gave them some talents.

756
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,660
- You don't know?
- Well, it doesn't matter.

757
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,790
He doesn't know
what they were called!

758
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,120
- They were called Simon and Adrian.
- You said you didn't know!

759
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,250
It really doesn't matter. The point is,
there were these two servants.

760
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:17,290
- He's making it up as he goes along.
- No, I'm not!

761
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,620
And he gave them
Wait, were there three?

762
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,040
- Oh, he's terrible.

763
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,580
- There were two or three.
- Oh, get off!

764
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:34,160
Now hear this!
Blessed are they...

765
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,540
- Three.
- who convert their neighbor's asses.

766
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:40,370
- For they shall inhibit their girth.
- Rubbish!

767
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,660
- And to them only shall be given

768
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:47,000
to them only...

769
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,870
shall be given

770
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,660
- What?
- Hmm?

771
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,330
- Shall be given what?
- Oh, nothing.

772
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,830
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

773
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,200
- Yes, you were going to say something.
- No, I finished.

774
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,370
- Tell us before you go.
- I'm finished.

775
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,750
- No, you don't.
- Why won't he tell?

776
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,500
- Won't say!
- It ain't a secret, is it?

777
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,370
- Must be, otherwise he'd tell us.
- Tell us.

778
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,450
- Leave me alone.
- What is the secret?

779
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,910
- ls it the secret of eternal life?
- He won't say.

780
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,700
If I knew the secret
of eternal life, I wouldn't say.

781
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,330
- Leave me alone!
- Just tell me, please.

782
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:26,290
- We were here first.

783
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,950
- Go away!
- Tell us, master.

784
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,000
- ls that his gourd?
- Yeah, but it's under offer.

785
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,160
This is his gourd.

786
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,450
- Ten!
- It is his gourd!

787
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,500
We will carry it
for you, master.

788
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,040
- Master?
- He's gone!

789
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,540
- He's been taken up.

790
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,660
He's been taken up!

791
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,580
- Nineteen!
- No, there he is. Over there.

792
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:20,120
Look! Oh! Oh!

793
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,120
He has given us a sign.

794
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,580
He has given us his shoe!

795
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,450
The shoe is the sign.
Let us follow his example.

796
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,700
- What?
- Let us, like him, hold up one shoe!

797
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:36,000
For this is his sign that all
who follow him shall do likewise!

798
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,580
- Yes!
- No, no. The shoe is a sign...

799
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,830
that we must gather shoes
together in abundance.

800
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,410
Cast off the shoes.
Follow the gourd!

801
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,540
No, let us gather shoes
together! Let me!

802
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,950
No, it is a sign that, like him, we must
think not of the things of the body...

803
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,950
but of the face and head.

804
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,620
- Give me your shoe!
- Get off!

805
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,120
Follow the gourd,
the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem!

806
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,870
- The gourd!
- Hold up the sandal,
as he has commanded us.

807
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,540
- It is a shoe!
- It's a sandal!

808
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,080
- No, it isn't!
- Cast it away!

809
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,080
- Put it on!
- Clear off!

810
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,750
Take the shoes
and follow him!

811
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,370
Come back! Stop!

812
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,910
Let us Let us pray.

813
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,950
Yea, he cometh to us...

814
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,330
Iike the seeds of the grain.

815
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,370
Master! Master!

816
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,290
Hey! ls there
another way down?

817
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,000
Is there another path
down to the river?

818
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,370
Please, please help me.
I've got to get

819
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:37,040
Oh, my foot! Oh

820
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,410
- Shhh.
- Oh, damn, damn, damn!

821
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,040
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, damn, damn it! Blast it!

822
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,370
- I'm sorry. Shhh.
- Don't you "shhh" me.

823
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,500
Eighteen years of total silence,
and you "shhh" me!

824
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,700
- What?
- I've kept my vow for 18 years...

825
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,830
Not a single, recognizable,
articulate sound has passed my lips.

826
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,450
Could you be quiet
for another five minutes?

827
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,160
It doesn't matter now.
I might as well enjoy myself.

828
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,000
For the last 18 years,
I've wanted to shout...

829
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,790
and sing and scream
my name out!

830
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:09,950
- Shhh. Shhh.
- Oh, I'm alive!

831
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,120
<i>Hava nagila, hava nagila</i>

832
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,040
<i>Hava nagila</i>

833
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,750
Oh, I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds. Hello, trees.

834
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,580
I'm alive! I'm alive!

835
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:27,540
<i>Hava nagila
Hava n'ra, n'ra</i>

836
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,120
Master! Master! Master!

837
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,660
- Master!
- The master! He is here!

838
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:39,120
- His shoe led us to him!

839
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,870
Speak! Speak to us, master.
Speak to us!

840
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,660
Go away!

841
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,330
A blessing! A blessing!

842
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,870
How shall we go away, master?

843
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,370
Oh, just go away
and leave me alone!

844
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,580
Give us a sign!

845
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,950
He has given us a sign!
He has brought us to this place!

846
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,870
I didn't bring you here.
You just followed me.

847
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh, it's still a good sign
by any standard.

848
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,000
Master, your people
have walked many miles to be with you!

849
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,040
They are weary
and have not eaten.

850
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,250
It's not my fault
they haven't eaten.

851
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,790
There is no food
in this high mountain!

852
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:17,080
What about the juniper
bushes over there?

853
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,870
A miracle! A miracle!

854
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,290
He has made the bush
fruitful by his words!

855
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,750
They've brought forth
juniper berries.

856
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:31,500
Of course! They're juniper bushes!
What do you expect!

857
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,660
Show us another miracle.

858
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,830
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!

859
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,620
Is not the miracle of
the juniper bushes enough?

860
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,790
I say, those
are my juniper bushes!

861
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,540
- They are a gift from God.
- They're all I've got to eat.

862
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:50,790
I say, get off those bushes.
Go on. Clear off.

863
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,120
Lord, I am affected
by a bald patch.

864
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,540
I'm healed!
The master has healed me!

865
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,540
I didn't touch him!

866
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,410
I was blind,
and now I can see!

867
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,620
A miracle! A miracle!

868
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,750
- Tell them to stop it.

869
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:13,330
I hadn't said a word
for 18 years till he came along.

870
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:17,160
A miracle!
He is the Messiah!

871
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,000
He hurt my foot!

872
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,330
- Hurt my foot!
- Hurt mine!

873
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:26,160
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah.

874
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,790
I say you are, Lord, and I should know.
I've followed a few.

875
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,160
Hail Messiah!

876
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,080
I'm not the Messiah!
Will you please listen?

877
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,450
I'm not the Messiah!
Do you understand? Honestly!

878
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,910
Only the true Messiah
denies his divinity.

879
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,330
What? Well, what sort of chance
does that give me?

880
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,620
All right,
I am the Messiah!

881
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,410
He is!
He is the Messiah!

882
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,830
Now, fuck off!

883
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,580
How shall we
fuck off, O Lord?

884
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,500
Just leave me alone!

885
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:09,700
You told these people
to eat my juniper berries!

886
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:12,790
You break my bloody foot,
you break my vow of silence...

887
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,910
and then you try to clean up
on my juniper bushes!

888
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,330
- Lay off!
- This is the Messiah, the Chosen One!

889
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:22,500
- No, he's not.
- An unbeliever!

890
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,750
- An unbeliever!
- Persecute. Kill the heretic!

891
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:32,750
- Seize him!
- Leave him alone!

892
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:35,120
Leave him alone!

893
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,450
Leave him alone.

894
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,500
Let him go! Please!

895
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:47,370
- Brian?
- Judith?

896
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,040
Cockadoodledoo!

897
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:38,790
Look! There he is!
The Chosen One has woken!

898
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,750
Brian!

899
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,290
- Brian!
- Hang on, Mother!

900
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,410
Shhh.

901
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:55,500
- Hello, Mother.
- Don't you "Hello, Mother" me!

902
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,750
What are all those people
doing out there?

903
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,790
- Well, I
- Come on. What have you been up to?

904
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:03,330
I think they must have
popped by for something.

905
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:06,160
Popped by?
Swarmed by, more like.

906
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,330
There's a multitude out there!

907
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,540
They started following me yesterday.

908
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,750
Well, they can stop
following you right now.

909
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,660
Now, stop following my son!

910
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,660
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

911
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:24,040
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

912
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,000
- The who?
- The Messiah!

913
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,700
There's no messiah in here.

914
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:33,000
There's a mess, all right,
but no messiah. Now, go away.

915
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,620
Brian! Brian!

916
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,790
Right, my lad.
What have you been up to?

917
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:39,830
- Nothing, Mum.
- Come on, out with it.

918
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,830
Well, they think
I'm the Messiah, Mum.

919
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,290
What have you
been telling them?

920
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,660
- Nothing. I only
- You're only making it
worse for yourself.

921
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,250
- I can explain.
- Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!

922
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,950
- Your son is a born leader.

923
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,700
Those people out there are following him
because they believe in him.

924
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:59,700
They believe he can give them hope
hope of a new life,

925
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:02,250
a new world,
a better future!

926
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,700
- Who's that?

927
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:09,830
That's Judith, Mum.
Judith, Mother.

928
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,830
Hmm. Aaah!

929
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:17,660
- Ohhh!
- Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!

930
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,700
Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

931
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:24,000
Now, you listen here.
He's not the Messiah!

932
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,330
He's a very naughty boy.
Now, go away!

933
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:31,450
- Who are you?
- I'm his mother, that's who.

934
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:36,000
Behold his mother!
Behold his mother!

935
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,500
Hail to thee,
mother of Brian!

936
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:44,080
Blessed art thou!
Hosanna!

937
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,790
All praise to thee,
now and always!

938
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:51,080
Well, now don't think
you can get around me like that.

939
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,620
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

940
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,790
- Now, shove off!
- No!

941
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:03,290
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes!

942
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,290
Oh, I see.
It's like that, is it?

943
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:09,750
- Yes!
- Oh, all right, then.

944
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:13,540
You can see him for one minute,
but not one second more!

945
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:16,080
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

946
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,330
- Promise?
- Well... all right.

947
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:24,080
All right, here he is, then.
Come on, Brian. Come and talk.

948
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,540
- But, Mum, Judith.
- Oh, leave that Welsh tart alone.

949
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,580
I don't really want to.

950
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:32,700
Brian! Brian!
Brian! Brian!

951
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,000
- Good morning.
- A blessing! A blessing!

952
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:44,620
No, no. Please.
Please, please listen.

953
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:48,000
I've got one or two
things to say.

954
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,620
Tell us!
Tell us both of them!

955
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,450
Look, you've
got it all wrong.

956
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:56,120
You don't need to follow me.

957
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,500
You don't need
to follow anybody.

958
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,870
You've got to think
for yourselves.

959
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,700
You're all individuals.

960
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:08,040
Yes, we're all individuals!

961
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,120
You're all different.

962
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,370
Yes, we're all different!

963
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,120
- I'm not.
- Shhh.

964
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,870
You've all got to work it
out for yourselves.

965
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:24,080
Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

966
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,120
Exactly.

967
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,450
Tell us more!

968
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,040
No! That's the point!
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

969
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,120
Otherwise Ow!

970
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,250
That's enough.
That's enough.

971
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:40,830
Ooh, that wasn't a minute!

972
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,660
- Oh, yes it was!
- Oh, no it wasn't!

973
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,660
Now, stop that!
And go away!

974
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,950
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

975
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,330
- Are you a virgin?
- I beg your pardon!

976
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:00,830
Well, if it's not a personal
question, are you a virgin?

977
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,620
If it's not
a personal question?

978
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,160
How much more personal
can you get?

979
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,500
Now, piss off!

980
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,950
- She is.
- Yeah, definitely.

981
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:19,250
- Morning, Savior.

982
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,200
Lay your hands
on me, quick!

983
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:34,540
Now, don't jostle
the Chosen One, please.

984
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,620
Don't push that baby
in the Savior's face.

985
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,330
I say, could you just
see my wife?

986
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,450
You'll have to wait,
I'm afraid.

987
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,000
We've got
a luncheon appointment.

988
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,040
The lepers are queuing.

989
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,000
My brotheronlaw
is the exmayor of Gath!

990
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,200
Brian, can I introduce
the gentleman who's letting us
have the Mounts on Sunday?

991
01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:01,410
- Don't push!
- And keep the noise down!

992
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:06,620
Those possessed by devils,
try and keep them under control.

993
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,500
Incurables, you'll just
have to wait for a few minutes.

994
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:14,160
Um, women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

995
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:19,040
Brian? Brian,
you were fantastic.

996
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,250
You weren't so bad yourself.

997
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:24,290
No. What you said just now.
It was quite extraordinary.

998
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,330
What?
All that, was it?

999
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,500
We don't any leaders.
You're so right.

1000
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,330
- Reg has been dominating us
for too long.
- Well, yes.

1001
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:35,200
- It needed saying,
and you said it, Brian.
- You're very attractive.

1002
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,540
It's our revolution.
We can all do it together.

1003
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,450
- I think. I think
- We're all behind you, Brian.

1004
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,620
- The revolution is in your hands!
- What?

1005
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,950
No, that's not
what I meant at all!

1006
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,330
You're fuckin' nicked,
me old beauty.

1007
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,330
Right.

1008
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,410
Stop it.

1009
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:06,000
Well, "Bwian," you've given us
a good "wun" for our money, what?

1010
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:11,870
But this time, I "guawantee"
you will not escape.

1011
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:16,910
Guard, do we have any
"cwucifixions" today?

1012
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,580
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

1013
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,950
Right. Now we have 140.
Nice, round number, eh, Biggus?

1014
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,790
- Hail Caesar!

1015
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,830
- Hail.
- The crowd outside getting restless.

1016
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,950
Permission
to disperse them, please.

1017
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,500
Disperse them?
I haven't addressed them yet.

1018
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,160
I know, sir, but

1019
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,660
My "addwess" is one of
the high points of the Passover.

1020
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,950
My "fwiend" Biggus Dickus has
come all the way from "Wome."

1021
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,500
- Hail Caesar.
- Hail "Thaesar,"

1022
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,370
You're not

1023
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,120
Are you not thinking of giving it
a miss this year, then, sir?

1024
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,290
Give it a miss?

1025
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:59,750
Well, it's just that they're in
a rather funny mood today, sir.

1026
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:02,830
"Weally," "centuwion," I'm "surpwised"
to hear a man like you...

1027
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:05,330
"wattled" by
a "wabble" of "wowdy" "webels."

1028
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:08,500
- Uh, a bit thundery, sir.
- Take him away.

1029
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,370
I'm a Roman!
Il can prove it! Honestly!

1030
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,790
And "cwucify" him well.
Yes.

1031
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,410
Biggus.

1032
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,200
- Il really wouldn't, sir.
- Out of the way, "centuwion."

1033
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:22,540
Let me come with you,
Pontius.

1034
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:26,790
I may be of "thome" "athistance"
if there is a "thudden" "crithis."

1035
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:31,200
Right. Now item four:
Attainment of world supremacy
within the next five years.

1036
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,450
- Uh, Francis, you've been
doing some work on this?
- Yeah. Thank you, Reg.

1037
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,000
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

1038
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,000
unless we can smash the Roman Empire
within the next 12 months.

1039
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,000
- Twelve months, yeah?
- Twelve months.

1040
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,540
And let's face it, as empires
go, this is the big one,

1041
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:50,870
so we gotta get up off our asses
and stop just talkin' about it.

1042
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:53,830
- Hear! Hear!
- It's action that counts, not words.

1043
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,290
- And we need action now!
- Hear! Hear!

1044
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,370
You're right. We could
sit around here all day,

1045
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:01,870
talkin', passin' resolutions,
makin' clever speeches.

1046
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,290
It's not gonna shift
one Roman soldier!

1047
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:07,790
So let's just stop gabbin' on about it.
It's completely pointless.

1048
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,830
- And it's gettin' us nowhere.
- Right!

1049
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:12,330
I agree. This is a complete
waste of time.

1050
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:16,200
- They've arrested Brian!
- What? What?

1051
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,950
They dragged him off!
They want to crucify him!

1052
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,540
Right! This calls
for immediate discussion!

1053
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,160
- What?
- lmmediate!

1054
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,660
- Right.
- New motion?

1055
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,080
Completely new motion.
Uh, that, uh,

1056
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,830
that there be
immediate action

1057
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:33,540
- Once the vote has been taken.
- Obviously once the vote's been taken.

1058
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:37,750
- You can't act on a resolution
till you've voted on it.
- Reg, let's go now, please!

1059
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:42,830
- Right! ln the light of fresh
information from Sibling Judith.
- Not so fast, Reg.

1060
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:46,790
Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple.

1061
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,910
All you've got to do
is to go out of that door now...

1062
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,540
and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

1063
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,500
It's happening, Reg!
Something's actually happening, Reg!

1064
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,120
Can't you understand?

1065
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,160
Oh!

1066
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,870
- Ooh. Ooh. Yup.

1067
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:08,290
A little ego trip
from the feminists?

1068
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,870
- What?
- Oh, sorry, Loretta?

1069
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,950
Uh, read that back,
would you?

1070
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,660
Next? Crucifixion?

1071
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,700
- Yes.
- Good.

1072
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:34,330
Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1073
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,500
Next? Crucifixion?

1074
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,500
- Yes.
- Good.

1075
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,080
Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1076
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,620
Next? Crucifixion?

1077
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,290
- Uh, no, freedom.
- Mmm? What?

1078
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:48,790
Uh, freedom for me.
They said I hadn't done anything,

1079
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:51,700
so I could go free
and live on an island somewhere.

1080
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:55,000
Oh. Well, that's jolly good.
Well, off you go then.

1081
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,700
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.

1082
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,250
Oh, I see.
Very good, very good.

1083
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,580
- Well, out of the door
- Yeah, I know the way. Out the door,

1084
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,580
one cross each,
line on the left.

1085
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,580
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.

1086
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,660
- Crucifixion? Good.
- Yes.

1087
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:27,290
People of "Jewusalem,"

1088
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:30,450
"Wome" is your "fwiend."

1089
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:39,500
To "pwove" our "fwiendship,"
it is "customawy" at this time...

1090
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,790
to "welease" a "wandewer"
"fwom" our "pwisons."

1091
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:51,950
Whom would you
have me "welease"?

1092
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,120
- "Welease" "Woger"!

1093
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,830
"Welease" "Woger"!
"Welease" "Woger"!

1094
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,620
"Vewy" well,
I shall "welease" "Woger"!

1095
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,040
Sir, uh, we don't
have a Roger, sir.

1096
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,540
- What?
- Uh, we don't have anyone
of that name, sir.

1097
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:18,910
Ah. We have no "Woger."

1098
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,660
Well, what about
"Wodewick," then?

1099
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:28,160
Yeah! Release "Wodewick"!
Release "Wodewick"!

1100
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:33,080
"Centuwion,"
why do they titter so?

1101
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:37,000
Just some,
uh, Jewish joke, sir.

1102
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:41,500
Are they... "wagging" me?

1103
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,580
- Oh, no, sir.

1104
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:51,080
"Vewy" well.
I shall "welease" "Wodewick"!

1105
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,120
- Sir, we don't have a Roderick, either.

1106
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,450
- No "Woger," no "Wodewick."
- Sorry, sir.

1107
01:15:56,540 --> 01:16:01,410
Who is this "Wog" Who is
this "Wodewick" to whom you "wefer"?

1108
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,330
- He's a "wobber"!

1109
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:07,290
- And a "wapist"!

1110
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,450
And a pickpocket!

1111
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,500
- Yeah Shh! Shh!
- Shut up!

1112
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,580
- He sounds a "notowious" "cwiminal."
- We haven't got him, sir.

1113
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,410
Do we have anyone
in our "pwisons" at all?

1114
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,410
- Oh, yes, sir. We got a Samson, sir.
- Samson?

1115
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:26,750
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Uh, Silus the Assyrian Assassin.

1116
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,870
Uh, several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1117
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:33,620
- Uh, 67
- Let me "thpeak" to them.

1118
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,000
- Oh, no
- Yes, good idea, Biggus.

1119
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:40,700
Citizens, we have
Samson the Sadducee Strangler,

1120
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:43,450
Silus the Assyrian Assassin

1121
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,080
- Several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

1122
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,160
Next.

1123
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,620
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.

1124
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:55,450
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1125
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,910
- Jailer
- Excuse me. There's been
some sort of mistake.

1126
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,660
Just a moment, would you?
Jailer, how many have come through?

1127
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,830
What?

1128

Uh, how many

1129
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,450

1138
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,290
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?

1139
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:43,330
NNNNo, sir.

1144
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,830
I don't think you can say it's
too good for them. It's very nasty.

1145
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:03,450
Oh, it's not as nnnana

1146
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,790

I just thought up, sir.

1153
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:32,160
Get a move on, Big Nose. There's people
waitin' to be crucified out here.

1154
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,410
- Could I see a lawyer or someone?

1155
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,330
- Um, do, do you have a lawyer?
- No, but I'm a Roman.

1156
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:40,290
How about a retrial?
We got plenty of time.

1157
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:43,410
- Shut up, you!
- Miserable Romans. No sense of humor.

1158
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,830
- I'm sorry. Bit of a hurry.

1159
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:50,250
Can you go straight out?
Line on the left, one cross each. Now

1160
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,410
Was it something I said?

1161
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,620
- Silence!

1162
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,830
This man commands
a "cwack" legion!

1163
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,950
He "wanks" as high
as any in "Wome."

1164
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,500
Crucifixion party.

1165
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,200
Morning. Now, we will be on
a show as we go through the town,

1166
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:34,250
so let's not
let the side down.

1167
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:37,370
Keep in a straight line, three lengths
between you and the man in front...

1168
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:39,700
and a good, steady pace.

1169
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:42,000
Crosses over
your left shoulders,

1170
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,660
and if you keep your backs
hard up against the cross beam,

1171
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:46,660
- you'll be there in no time.

1172
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,700
All right, centurion.

1173
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:53,000
Crucifixion party
Wait for it!

1174
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:59,000
Crucifixion party,
by the left, forward!

1175
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,620
You lucky bastards!

1176
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:10,790
You lucky, jammy bastards!

1177
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,700
Let me shoulder
your burden, brother.

1178
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,700
Oh, thank you.

1179
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,500
- HHey! Hey!
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1180
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,500
- Uh, it's not my cross.
- Shut up and get on with it!

1181
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:38,950
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson.

1182
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,830
- All right.

1183
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,160
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

1184
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:47,290
This time I want to hear
no "Weubens,"

1185
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:50,580
no "Weginalds,"

1186
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:54,040
no "Wudolph
the Wednosed Weindeers."

1187
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,080
No Spencer Tracys!
- Or we shall release no one!

1188
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:01,450
- Release Brian!
- Oh, yeah. That's a good one.

1189
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:06,330
"Welease" "Bwian"!
"Welease" "Bwian"!

1190
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:09,160
"Vewy" well. That's it.

1191
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,950
- Sir, we, uh, we have got a Brian, sir.
- What?

1192
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,080
Uh, you just sent him
for crucifixion, sir.

1193
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,160
Wait, wait.
We do have a "Bwian."

1194
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,500
- Well, go and "wepwieve" him,
"stwaight" away.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1195
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,080
"Vewy" well.

1196
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,790
I shall... "welease" "Bwian"!

1197
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:35,120
- Get a move on, there!
- Or what?

1198
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,830
- Or you'll be in trouble.
- Oh, dear.

1199
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:41,040
You mean I might have to give up
being crucified in the afternoons?

1200
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,620
- Shut up!
- That would be a blow, wouldn't it?

1201
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:47,120
I wouldn't have nothing to do.
Oh, thank you.

1202
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,330
Are they gone?

1203
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:57,620
WWe've got lumps of it
round the back.

1204
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,620
- What?
- Oh, don't worry about him, sir.

1205
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,450
He's ma
He's m He's ma

1206
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,450
He's mm
He's mm

1207
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:09,500
- He's mad, sir.
- Are they gone?

1208
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,790
Oh, ye N

1209
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:17,620
- I n Uh, I n NNNN

1210
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,660
- NNNN
- Oh, come on!

1211
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:23,160
Yes, sir.

1212
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,000
- Anyway, get on with the story.
- Well, I knew she never
really liked him, so I just

1213
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,620
Right.

1214
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,950
That's the motion to get on with it,
passed with one abstention.

1215
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,660
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a seconder for

1216
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,830
- Let's just go.
- Yeah.

1217
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,330
Oh, no!

1218
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:54,040
- Bloody Romans!
- Watch it!

1219
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,080
There's still
a few crosses left.

1220
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,250
Up you go, Big Nose.

1221
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:03,290
- I'll get you for this, you bastard.
- Oh, yeah?

1222
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:06,620
- Oh, yeah. Don't worry. I never forget a face.
- No?

1223
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:11,000
I warn you, I'm gonna punch you
so hard, you Roman git!

1224
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,330
Shut up, you Jewish turd!

1225
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:16,540
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish!

1226
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,790
- I'm a Samaritan!
- A Samaritan?

1227
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,660
This is supposed
to be a Jewish section.

1228
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:24,620
It doesn't matter.
You're all gonna die in a day or two!

1229
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:28,160
It may not matter to you, Roman,
but it certainly matters to us,
doesn't it, darling?

1230
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,870
- Oh, rather!
- Under the terms
of the Roman occupancy,

1231
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:34,910
we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

1232
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,540
Pharisees separate
from Sadducees.

1233
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:40,750
- And Swedish separate from Welsh!

1234
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:44,750
All right, all right, all right.
We'll soon settle this.

1235
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:49,290
Hands up all those who don't
want to be crucified here.

1236
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:52,410
- Right. Next!

1237
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,450
- Uh, look. It's not my cross.
- What?

1238
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,290
Um, it's not my cross.
I was, um, holding it for someone.

1239
01:23:58,370 --> 01:24:00,330
Just lie down.
I haven't got all day.

1240
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,750
No, of course. Look.
I hate to make a fuss

1241
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:06,120
Look. We've had a busy day.
There's 140 of you lot to get up.

1242
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,750
- ls he Jewish?
- Will you be quiet?

1243
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,080
We don't want any more
Samaritans around here.

1244
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,410
Belt up!
Will you let me down if he comes back?

1245
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,080
Yeah, yeah,
we'll let you down. Next!

1246
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,950
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to take orders.

1247
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,330
I like orders.

1248
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,660
See? Not so bad,
once you're up.

1249
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,660
You being rescued, then,
are you?

1250
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,660
It's a bit late for that now,
isn't it?

1251
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,120
Oh, now, now. We've got
a couple of days up here.

1252
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,160
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

1253
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,700
- Oh?
- Yeah. My brother usually rescues me,

1254
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:02,330
if he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

1255
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:04,370
- Oh?
- Randy little bugger.

1256
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:06,750
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.

1257
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,330
Hello.
Your family arrived, then?

1258
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,120
Reg!

1259
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,620
- Hello, Sibling Brian.
- Thank God you've come, Reg.

1260
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:23,290
Well, I think I should point out
first, Brian, in all fairness,
we are not the rescue committee.

1261
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:26,200
However, I have been asked to read
the following prepared statement...

1262
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:28,250
on behalf of the movement.

1263
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:31,950
"We the People's Front of Judea
brackets, officials, end brackets

1264
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,620

fraternal and sisterly greetings...

1265
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:39,080
to you, Brian, on this,
the occasion of your martyrdom."

1266
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,000
What?
"Your death will stand as a landmark...

1267
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,000
"in the continuing struggle
to liberate the parent land...

1268

"from the hands of the Roman
imperialist aggressors,

1269

"excluding those concerned with

other Romans contributing...

of the P.F.J., etc."

1273
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,580
And I'd just like to add,
on a personal note, my own admiration...

1274
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,580
for what you're doing
for us, Brian,

1275
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,830
and what must be, after all,
for you a very difficult time.

1276
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:14,000
- Reg, wwhat are you going to
- Goodbye, Brian, and thanks.

1277
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,250
Well done, Brian.
Keep it up, lad.

1278
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:20,910
Terrific work, Brian.

1279
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:28,450
Right. And

You bastards!

1286
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:50,620
- You bastards!
You sanctimonious bastards!
- Where is Brian of Nazareth?

1287
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:54,080
- I have an order for his release.
- You stupid bastards!

1288
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,450
- Uh, I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- What?

1289
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,500
- Yeah, Ill'm Brian of Nazareth.
- Take him down.

1290
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,910
- I'm Brian of Nazareth!
- I'm Brian!

1291

- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!

1292
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,750
- I'm Brian!

1293
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:11,660
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!

1294
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,290
Take him away
and release him.

1295
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:18,290
No, I'm only joking. I'm not
really Brian. No, I'm not Brian.

1296
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:21,580
I was only It was a joke.
I'm only pulling your leg.

1297
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:26,410
It's a joke! I'm not him!
I'm just having you on! Put me back!

1298
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,950
Bloody Romans.
Can't take a joke.

1299

The Judean People's Front!

1300
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,200
The Judean People's Front!

1301
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:47,040
Forward all!

1302
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,450
- Come on!
- The Judean People's Front!

1303

- The Judean People's Front!

We are the Judean People's Front
Crack Suicide Squad.

1305
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,120
Suicide Squad, attack!

1306
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,160
That showed them.

1307
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:29,620
- You silly sods.

1308
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:33,450
Brian! Brian! Brian!

1309
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:37,790
- Judith!
- Terrific! Great!

1310
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:41,450
Reg has explained it all to me.
I think it's great, what you're doing.

1311
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,500
Thank you, Brian.

1312
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,250
I'll, I'll never forget you.

1313
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,250
So there you are!

1314
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:59,750
I might have known
it would end up like this.

1315
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:03,790
To think of all the love and
affection I've wasted on you.

1316
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:06,950
Well, if that's how you treat
your poor old mother...

1317
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,120
in the autumn years
of her life,

1318
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,660
all I can say is,
go ahead, be crucified!

1319
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,250
See if I care.
I might have known

1320
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:17,580
Mum!

1321
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:21,950
- Mum!
- I don't know
what the world's coming to.

1322
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:31,160
Cheer up, Brian.
You know what they say.

1323
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:34,290
Some things in life are bad.

1324
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,790
They can really make you mad.

1325
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:40,870
Other things just
make you swear and curse.

1326
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:43,700
<i>When you're chewing
on life's gristle</i>

1327
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:47,290
<i>Don't grumble
Give a whistle</i>

1328
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:51,410
<i>And this'll help things
turn out for the best</i>

1329
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,450
<i>And</i>

1330
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:58,160
<i>Always look
on the bright side of life</i>

1331
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:06,620
<i>Always look
on the light side of life</i>

1332
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:13,580
<i>lf life seems jolly rotten
there's something you've forgotten</i>

1333
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:17,120
<i>And that's to laugh and smile
and dance and sing</i>

1334
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,500
<i>When you're feeling in the dumps</i>

1335
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,500
<i>Don't be silly chumps</i>

1336
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:25,910
<i>Just purse your lips and
whistle, that's the thing</i>

1337
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,540
<i>And always look
on the bright side of life</i>

1338
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:38,540
<i>Always look
on the bright side of life</i>

1339
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,750
<i>For life is quite absurd</i>

1340
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:45,750
<i>And death's the final word</i>

1341
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:49,160
<i>You must always face
the curtain with a bow</i>

1342
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,450
<i>Forget about your sin</i>

1343
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,500
<i>Give the audience a grin</i>

1344
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,950
<i>Enjoy it, it's
your last chance anyhow</i>

1345
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:02,620
<i>So always look
on the bright side of death</i>

1346
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:10,580
<i>Just before you draw
your terminal breath</i>

1347
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:17,500
<i>Life's a piece of shit
when you look at it</i>

1348
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:21,450
<i>Life's a laugh and
death's a joke, it's true</i>

1349
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:25,750
<i>You'll see it's all a show
People laughing as you go</i>

1350
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:29,000
<i>Just remember that
the last laugh is on you</i>

1351
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:34,330
<i>And always look
on the bright side of life</i>

1352
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,910
<i>Always look
on the right side of life</i>

1353
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,830
- Come on, Brian. Cheer up.

1354
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:50,700
<i>Always look
on the bright side of life</i>

1355
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,750
<i>Always look
on the right side of life</i>

1356
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:01,750
Worse things happen
at sea, you know?

1357
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:05,580
<i>Always look
on the bright side of life</i>

1358
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:08,000
What have you got to lose?
You come from nothing.

1359
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,540
You go back to nothing.
What have you lost?

1360
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:14,620
- Nothing!
<i>- Always look
on the right side of life</i>

1361
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,750
Nothing will come from nothing.
You know what they say?

1362
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,750
- <i>Always look on</i>
- Cheer up, you old bugger.

1363
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:22,580
- <i>The bright side of life</i>
- Give us a grin. There you are.

1364
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:26,580
See? It's the end of the film.
Incidentally, this record's available in the foyer.

1365
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:30,580
<i>Always look
on the right side of life</i>

1366
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:33,660
Who do you think pays for all
this rubbish?

1367
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:38,000
<i>Always look
on the bright side of life</i>

1368
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,950
I told him. I said to him, "Bernie,
there'll never make their money back."

1369
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,290
