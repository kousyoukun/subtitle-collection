I'm aware of the danger.

11
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:09,242
I'm making this trip
of my own free will

12
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,525
and without coercion.

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,136
I'm aware of all Humanity

Chester Hills, white male, age 73.

21

This is my first visit
to Mr. Hills' home.

22
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,759
His motel room.

23
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,399
I'm 15 minutes early.

00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,559
Mr. Hills' deportation is scheduled

I'm looking for Chester Hills.

<i>A new life awaits you
in New Eden.</i>

29
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,334
Hey, buddy!

30
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:29,039
We have an appointment.
He's expecting me.

31
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,640
Yeah, I didn't think
you were here to rent a room.

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,142
Chester's across the parking lot.

33
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:39,479
Up the stairs to your right.
Room 223.

34
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:41,506
I'm obliged by management

35
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,865
to tell all city dwellers
not to drink from our taps.

36
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,827
But if you're interested,

37
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,160
I've got purified water.

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,390
Liter bottle seal's intact.

39
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,800
Nitrate-free.
No detectable liquid waste.

40
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,359
It's a long ways
back to the city.

41
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,320
You know unlicensed sale
of clean water is a felony.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,320
Yeah, well, we all do
what we have to. Don't we?

43
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,480
There's a loose board
on the stairs. Don't trip.

44
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,688
Or do.

47
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,119
This is it? You're not employed.
These paystubs are 12 years old.

48
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,454
Is this why I drove 300 miles?

49
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:44,447
I have a right to an appeal.

50
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:47,010
Last time I checked
this is still America.

51
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,499
Land of the free,
home of the brave.

52
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,600
Well, it is, isn't it?

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,120
I am here to help you.
I am not your enemy.

54
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,200
I don't want your help.

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,836
You have no right to come in here
and tell me how to live.

56
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:01,639
None whatsoever.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,648
Well, I'm very sorry
you feel that way.

58
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:06,625
But I do believe
New Eden will provide you

59
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,003
with the fresh start
you so rightly deserve.

60
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,239
Don't you want a better life?

61
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,321
You have no income.

62
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:14,805
You've exhausted all of your
government benefits.

63
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,039
How will you survive?

64
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,604
You must be a productive citizen.
It is the law.

65
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,234
It is a crime to do otherwise.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,400
You're destitute.
A burden to society.

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,099
You have no grounds
for an appeal

68
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,480
under the rules
of the Humanity Act.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,969
And if you don't
agree to resettlement,

70
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:37,280
I'll have no other choice
but to have you arrested.

71
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,679
I'm no fool.

72
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:41,399
I know the truth.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,467
And what truth is that?

74
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,080

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,281
Mr. Hills, are you all right?

78
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:03,673
I'm just jim-dandy, Mr. Kross!

79
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,679
I am a citizen
of the United States of America.

80
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,158
I dined at the White House.

81
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,159
Goddammit!

82
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,280
It was a pretty good meal, too.

83
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,079
Chester, what in the hell is...

84
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,880
You little shit!

85
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,680
I got a look at the
coroner's report.

86
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:13,956
You fired three rounds.

87
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,639
One of which, caught that old man
right between the eyes.

88
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:20,531
He was the governor of Colorado
once upon a time. You know that?

89
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,799
How the mighty fall.

90
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,976
It was just
a lucky shot.

91
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:29,598
Well, look, good,
now management took notice.

92
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,039
You're getting promoted.

93
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,554
It doesn't bother you
that two men are dead?

94
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,184
It's a hostile environment,
you know.

95
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,920
What are you gonna do?
You looked after yourself.

96
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,280
People are desperate. Can't find
clean water. Soil won't grow food.

97
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,043
I've seen children
drink their own piss.

98
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:47,840
Which is why
I rarely leave the city.

99
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,747
Nice.

100
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,839
It's a shame there are
no fish left in the ocean.

101
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,064
When I was a kid,
there were all kinds of fish.

102
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,588
My mother would take me
up north to Canada.

103
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,359
Jackfish Lake.
I believe the cabin's still there.

104
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,098
Know what, when you were a kid,
your mother starved to death.

105
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,403
Almost took you with her.

106
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,799
There's nothing
up there but desert.

107
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,512
You don't know
that it's all desert.

108
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:16,667
Yeah, I do.

109
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:19,445
Radiation contaminated
everything, Noah. Everything.

110
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,680
And that's restricted information.

111
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Why do you insist
on livin' in the past?

112
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,240
- Monet?
- You like it?

113
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:36,479
I like the monetary value.
Where's your <i>Dogs Playing Poker</i>?

114

115
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:41,696
There's little enthusiasm
for New Eden.

116
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:45,193
There are rumors of
overcrowding and disease.

117
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,253
People would rather stay put.

118
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,440
But that's not an option.

119
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,743
Is it?

120
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,812
Chester Hills said
he knew the truth.

121
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:57,839
The truth?

122
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,640
He was determined to stay put.
He wasn't going anywhere.

123
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,720
Chester Hills was a sad old man

And don't get those dirty.

I have to return them

They won't be
a factor in my review.

He's free to take them off.

156
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,903
I'm taking them off.

157

Well, don't get the laces in a knot.

158

You received the registered letter

Yes, I did, they're

Perfect.
No worries then.

161
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,502
Sorry.

162
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,701
What kind of gun do you have?

163
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:09,320
It's a Beretta PX4.

164
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,639
- You like it?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,240
It won't make you sick.
It's boiled and filtered.

166
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,160
We don't want you
dying at our table.

167
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,359
That's most considerate.
Thank you.

168
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,363
Why are you writing
all those numbers?

169
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,163
I'm attempting to verify
your mother's productivity rating.

170
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:44,464
As citizens of this great nation,

171
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,239
it's our duty to contribute
more than we take.

172
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,860
- You sound like my teacher.
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,304
We all must pull our weight.

174
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:51,852
She says that too.

175
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:55,079
Shouldn't people with more
help those with less?

176
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,619
In theory, yes.

177
00:13:56,718 --> 00:14:00,240
But in practice, it's a
difficult concept to sustain.

178
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:02,560
Is that why we have to move?

179
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,439
Our score is too low?
We don't contribute enough?

180
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,622
You look thirsty.

181
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,359
My friend Bobby Sloan
moved to New Eden.

182
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:28,200
He promised to write, but he didn't
Not to me anyway.

183
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,463
I bet has new friends.

184
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:32,639
I bet he's forgotten
all about me.

185
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,124
I bet he drinks
lemonade every day.

186
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,719
I wouldn't be so hard on him.

187
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,520
Where is he now?

188
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,157
According to his itinerary,

189
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:17,519
Kross is reviewing a deportation
order in the town of Oliver.

190
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,040
Oh, she's a pretty woman.

191
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,867
The appointment was
scheduled for noon, so, uh...

192
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,719
Yeah, he should've returned
and filed his report by now.

193
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
Why the sudden interest in Kross?

194
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,216
He's up for a promotion.
Standard procedure.

195
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:35,529
Standard procedure.
Uh, since when, sir?

196
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,847
Send me his report
as soon as he's filed it.

197
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:41,954
And he's not to know
he's being investigated.

198
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,134
Yes, sir.

199
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,206
I can't remember the last time
we used the good silverware.

200
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:01,434
Lucas, I will glue your
mouth shut. I swear.

201
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,864
Please speak
when you're spoken to.

202
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,422
What'd you eat
for lunch today, Lucas?

203
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,967
We didn't eat lunch.
Just breakfast.

204
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,519
No one goes hungry
in this house.

205
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,207
You asked for this review.

206
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,359
I have to know
you can feed your son.

207
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,031
Well, I do my best.

208
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,628
My mom's pretty,
don't you think?

209
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:21,904
Lucas!

210
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:24,199
She's never been married.

211
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,921
Mr. Kross already knows that.
He knows everything about us.

212
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:29,079
Isn't that right, Mr. Kross?

213
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,621
Do you know how old I am?

214
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,400
You're eleven.

215
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:38,102
What is my middle name?

216
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:39,839
You don't have one.

217
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,302
Correct.

218
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,542
You're done.

219
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,160
How'd I do?

220
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,680
Why...

221
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,640
Why do you want to stay here?

222
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:17,519
Nothing grows.
There's no hope.

223
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:20,654
I think you just have
to look a little closer.

224
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,360
This is where
my son and I belong.

225
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
We're happy here.

226
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,940
The Bureau rarely makes mistakes.

227
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,160
And I have little say
in these matters.

228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,160
According to subsection 16
of the Humanity Act,

229
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,753
you and your son

230
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:45,508
are to be transferred to the
resettlement colony of New Eden.

231
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:49,400
You have 12 hours to pack your
belongings and be ready to leave.

232
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,686
Essentials only. Toiletries.
A change of clothing.

233
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:54,880
That kind of thing.

234
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,159
This pamphlet...

235
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,760
This pamphlet explains everything.

236
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:08,223
He has a recital
tomorrow afternoon.

237
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,520
And he's been
practicing for months.

238
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,027
So, what am I
supposed to tell him?

239
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:16,200
Tell him
it's for the best.

240
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:10,949
Oh, my God!

241
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,560
He's all I have.

242
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,311
You used all our clean water.

243
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:35,657
It's okay.

244
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,543
You need to promise me that you
will never scare me like that again.

245
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,102
I promise.

246
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,640
You're a lucky boy, Lucas.

247
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,480
Such a lucky boy.
Crazy.

248
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,280
Agent Noah Kross.

249
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:02,829
Access case file 56672996.

250
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:06,640
Implement under my authority
the following instructions:

251
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,946
Delay the deportation
by Rachel and Lucas Weller.

252
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,845
Take no further action
without my consent.

253
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:16,487
No notes at this time.

254
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,319
Lock file.
Report to follow.

255
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,359
How'd you get in here?

256
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,560
Key was under the mat.

257
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,600
I don't have a mat.

258
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,448
What's goin' on, Noah?

259
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:08,318
You're up for a promotion.

260
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:11,167
Now, why would you delay
a deportation order, huh?

261
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,480
What's so special
about this file?

262
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,597
The boy sings.

263
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:17,359
He has a recital.

264
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,822
He's been practicing for weeks.

265
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,169
A what?

266
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:22,324
A recital.

267
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
You getting soft?

268
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,348
It's a good memory
for a boy to have.

269
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:30,554
No matter what
happens to him next.

270
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,280
Just let him keep it.

271
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,843
Noah, you can't help these people.

272
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:36,811
Deportation orders are final.
You know that.

273
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:38,154
And their fate is sealed.

274
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,920
You had a heart once, Adam.

275
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,680
They've got 24 hours.

276
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:52,280
And you need
to get your lock fixed.

277
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,159
Going up?

278
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,105
I had to be sure
we weren't being followed.

279
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:04,760
We only have a few minutes.

280
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,520
Why should I trust you?

281
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:13,696
We both have a lot to lose
if this is a trap.

282
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:16,753
What is it you know,
Mr. Ravetch?

283
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,039
'Never surrender'?
What does that mean?

284
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,919
What is 'the truth'?

285
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:25,689
My brother and his wife

286
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:27,800
were deported to New Eden
three years ago.

287
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,225
I haven't heard from them since.

288
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,100
- I can't help you.
- No.

289
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,240
But you can help others.

290
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,279
This will answer
all of your questions.

291
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,914
And I am not in this alone.

292
00:25:50,302 --> 00:25:52,120
We could use your help.

293
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,599
You know where to find me.

294
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,399
What am I lookin' at?

295
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,520
<i>New Eden.</i>

296
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,719

308
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,720
Stay close, please.
What are you doing here?

309
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,445
Thought you could use a ride.

310
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:10,640
To where?

311
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,919
Hey, you were good!

312
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,919
I mean, you were really good.

313
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,000
- You think so?
- Absolutely!

314
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,943
Wouldn't you say so?

315
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,222
Rachel?

316
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,799
I don't like to brag,
but yeah, you were very good.

317
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:28,050
Come on.

318
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,400
You can buy a house around here
for what this coffee costs.

319
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,932
It was a gift.

320
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:08,599
Coffee is hard to find
even in the city.

321
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:11,687
I was saving it for a...

322
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:14,359
a very special occasion.

323
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,279
- Would you like a cup?
- Yes, please.

324
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:27,862
Um...

325
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:31,730
I really appreciate
what you did for me and Lucas.

326
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:33,600
I have a confession.

327
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,685
Are you certain I should hear it?

328
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:38,759
Well, I tried to bribe you
with a glass of lemonade.

329
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:41,244
And his shoes were borrowed.

330
00:29:42,632 --> 00:29:44,825
And I have no idea
how to make coffee.

331
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,640
Let me show you.

332
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,857
Do you have a coffee pot?

333
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,640
It makes the process
a little easier.

334
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:53,159
You aren't what I expected.

335
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,159
You know, the flowers on that dress
are Mexican asters.

336
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,000
They don't grow anymore.

337
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,707
No, that's nonsense,
they must grow somewhere.

338
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,120
No, they don't.

339
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,843
You can't stay here.

340
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,720
They won't let you.
They'll come for you.

341
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,746
They always do.

342
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,879
And I won't be able
to stop them.

343
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,959
I must have a coffee pot
around here somewhere.

344
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,439
We have to leave,
the three of us. Now!

345
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,760
Pack your bag. We're leaving.
Take only what you can carry.

346
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:31,880
- What about my books?
- Take one.

347
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,557
Put the gun down or
I'll shoot her in the head, Noah.

348
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:47,799
And you know I will.

349
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,479
And the sidearm.

350
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,200
- Call the boy.
- He's not here.

351
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,662
I said call the boy.

352
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,440
You don't have to do this, Adam.

353
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:03,302
Hey, mister!

354
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,800
Ah, fuck!

355
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,844
<i>Fuel tank puncture.</i>

356
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,400
<i>Fuel tank puncture.</i>

357
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,721
Switch to reserve.

358
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:07,239
<i>Reserve tank empty.</i>

359
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,845
Transfer remaining fuel
from primary to reserve.

360
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,120
Pinpoint location using GPS.

361
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,479
<i>Satellite unavailable.
Present location unknown.</i>

362
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,297
Good. The link's down.

363
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:19,120
They can't track us for a while.

364
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,572
Way to go, Porter.
You're late.

365
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:31,480
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry. Um...

366
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,879
The key is in the cookie jar.

367
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,319
Are you deaf, Porter?
It's the bear with a hat on it.

368
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,182
Got it.

369
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,157
<i>Access denied.</i>

370
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:14,206
<i>Access denied.</i>

371
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:15,319
Not good.

372
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,319
There's a tool kit
behind the seat. Get it.

373
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,840
- Keep your eyes open.
- For what?

374
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,440
Anything that moves.

375
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,952
Noah, there's a big,
sweaty guy with a crutch.

376
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,515
What's he doin'?

377
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,101
Nothing.
Just watching.

378
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:43,535
If he moves, shoot him.

379
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,679
<i>Unauthorized removal of GPS.</i>

380
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:48,560
Disarm voice response.

381
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,947
This is crazy.
What are we doing?

382
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,635
Just go inside. See if you can
find some food and water.

383
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:53,776
I don't like this.

384
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,520
We haven't go much time.
I don't either.

385
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,280
I need some gasoline.
And I need it now.

386
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,519
It's best you remain
calm until help arrives.

387
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,994
Unless you have another crutch
hidden around here somewhere,

388
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:11,440
I suggest you help us.

389
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,902
Gasoline.

390
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,494
I was saving this
for a rainy day.

391
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,279
But I feel a storm
coming on.

392
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,699
How did a man like you
end up in this situation?

393
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:42,898
I had a little help.

394
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,209
Noah, there's a dust cloud
in the horizon.

395
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:46,461
Someone's coming.

396
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:48,046
You won't get far.
No one ever does.

397
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,568
Help me with these gas cans.

398
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,720
Mister, are you a good
family man?

399
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,359
I'm trying to be.

400
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,600
You'll need a good
head start.

406
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,888
Would you have hurt that man?

407
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,779
He had gasoline.
We needed it.

408
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,520
I did what I had to do.

409
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,039
Would you have killed him?

410
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,920
<i>He</i> thought so.

411
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:37,960
Son of a.

412
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,480
We have a Humanity
Bureau agent on the run

413
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,079
with woman and child
we know nothing about.

414
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,628
Why would a rising star in the
Bureau throw away his career?

415
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,160
What does he get in return?

416
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:53,649
Well, it's possible that
Kross knew Rachel Weller

417
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,760
before his time
with the Bureau.

418
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,933
Possible?
Find out for certain.

419
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:00,519
I wanna know who she is.

420
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,925
If they share a past,

421
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:04,359
I wanna know why
they've ran off into the desert.

422
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:06,202
I'm told Kross was your friend.

423
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:08,400
A good friend.
As good as friends get.

424
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,499
And yet he didn't confide in you?

425
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:12,439
What are you insinuating?

426
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,019
There are those

427
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:16,799
subversives hiding among us

428
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:19,839
who would destroy
what we left.

429
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:22,920
They don't believe this
government is a democracy anymore.

430
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:27,320
And whatever Kross is planning,

431
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:31,239
it's your responsibility to
make sure he doesn't succeed.

432
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,164
Those we've deemed expendable

433
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:37,559
need to believe there's
a better life waiting for them.

434
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,764
They need hope.

435
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:43,434
And we can't allow
that illusion to be destroyed.

436
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,240
I had these brought here
so I could make a point.

437
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:02,120
Huh.

438
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,903
What is that?

439
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:10,920
Is that tooth or bone?

440
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,439
I believe that's a child's tooth.

441
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,960
Yeah. You're right, it is.

442
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,036
So, you take a good
look at that, Westinghouse.

443
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,073
And you find Kross,
and you find him quickly.

444
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,200
Or you may find yourself
in New Eden as well.

445
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,122
Is it yours?

446
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:20,799
Yes.
But it's yours now.

447
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,839
I want you to have it.

448
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,422
For keeps?

449
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:27,385
Yeah.

450
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,085
Thanks.

451
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,959
Why do you look so sad?

452
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,263
Have we run out of luck?

453
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:38,840
No. We've got plenty left.

454
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,662
Check that out.

455
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,086
Jackfish Lake?

456
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,440
Is that where we're going?

457
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:50,999
What?

458
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,699
Canada. That's your plan?

459
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:58,839
There are no lakes anymore.
Not there or anywhere else.

460
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,160
It looks really nice.

461
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,800
Lucas, let's get back in the car.

462
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,919
- You can't...
- Don't disappoint him.

463
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,039
Next stop: Jackfish Lake.

464
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,840
Second place,
National Fly Fishing Competition.

465
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,239
It's in great shape for its age.

466
00:42:38,243 --> 00:42:39,256
Its age?

467
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,044
They stopped making vehicles
30 years ago.

468
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,640
This is an El Camino.
The last of its kind.

469
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,319
You won't find anything better.

470
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,920
Can you open the hood?

471
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,880
It smells, Mom.

472
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,359
Yeah, but it has four wheels,
and that's what counts.

473
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,427
And if I get caught
with your vehicle?

474
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:10,079
That battery alone is worth $1,000.

475
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,600
Straight swap.
Your El Camino for the station wagon.

476
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,999
I need some food and water.

477
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,480
Twenty bottles of water
and a case of baked beans.

478
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,000
<i>Clean</i> water.

479
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:25,616
Clean enough.

480
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:28,439
And I'll need that
fancy watch on your wrist.

481
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,200
I need directions.

482
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:35,887
Yeah.

483
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,640
There are no roads north.
Not anymore.

484
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,517
You won't get across the border.

485
00:43:41,616 --> 00:43:42,640
Says who?

486
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,873
Says those who tried
and came back.

487
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:47,040
You're not the first.

488
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,094
There's a man I met years ago.

489
00:43:57,194 --> 00:44:00,354
He might be able
to you help you.

490
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:01,503
If he's still alive.

491
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:15,553
Thank you.

492
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,267
- Floor?
- Uh, Three, please.

493
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:19,271
Three.

494
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,320
Well, isn't that so very odd.

495
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:29,116
The key that I found
in your bedroom

496
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:31,320
fits the control panel
of this elevator.

497
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,947
Who are you?

498
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:36,239
What did you give Noah Kross?

499
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,482
I don't know that name.

500
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:39,540
I don't know what
you're talking about.

501
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,760
Listen to me Irving Ravetch.

502
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,447
You're a subcontractor

503
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:45,679
for the Department
of National Defense.

504
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:48,623
You were given
very sensitive information.

505
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:50,719
And you were sworn to secrecy.

506
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,742
This is your son.

507
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,280
This is your wife.

508
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,040
Would you like
to see them again?

509
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,474
They are not involved.

510
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,862
What did you give him?

511
00:45:02,962 --> 00:45:04,920
How much does he know?

512
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,159
You have ten seconds
to save your family, Irving.

513
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:10,535
Nine, eight, seven,

514
00:45:10,634 --> 00:45:13,200
- Six, five, four...
- Project Eden.

515
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,440
- Three, two, one...
- I gave him Eden.

516
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:22,860
Did he

517
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,400
come to you

518
00:45:26,555 --> 00:45:28,785
for this information,
Irving?

519
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,719
All he wanted was the truth.

520
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,145
Pick up the pictures

521
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,039
of your wife and son, Irving.
Do it now.

522
00:45:46,999 --> 00:45:48,342
Pick 'em up!

523
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,412
Go home, Irving.

524
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:00,719
To your family.

525
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:03,279
They're waiting for you.

526
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,227
Hey, you wear
those shoes out,

527
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:30,439
you're walking
barefoot in the snow.

528
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:40,876
Damn it, where is he?
He's gone!

529
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:41,999
Lucas!

530
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,920
What is your business here, stranger?

531
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:16,322
I am sorry for your
welcoming committee

532
00:47:16,422 --> 00:47:17,919
but we can't be too careful.

533
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,293
My wife was murdered
by scavengers last year.

534
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:23,519
And my
daughter raped.

535
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,799
Adolf Schroder.

536
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,548
Hmm.

537
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:33,102
I am German.

538
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,399
I came here on vacation
with my parents as a boy.

539
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,919
Things did not go well.

540
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,000
And as you can see,
they didn't get much better.

541
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,072
It's not wise
to mess with Mother Nature.

542
00:47:52,343 --> 00:47:55,252
You can only spew so much
shit into the air and water

543
00:47:55,352 --> 00:47:56,759
before she starts to fight back.

544
00:47:58,777 --> 00:47:59,767
Um.

545
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,673
Well, we were told
you could help us.

546
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:05,799
Who told you this lie?

547
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:07,488
A farmer.

548
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:09,160
I know no farmer.

549
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:12,880
That's you in the picture,
isn't it?

550
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,359
Ah, yes.
I remember her now.

551
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,799
We were very young.

552
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:23,519
Her father sold us a car.

553
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:25,959
We didn't get very far in it.

554
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,439
You can keep it.

555
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,817
What do you need?

556
00:48:37,108 --> 00:48:38,760
A way north.

557
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:42,200
Across the border.
Through to Canada.

558
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,923
The land of 1,000 lakes.

559
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,039
When did you last visit?

560
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,160
When I was seven
with my mother. Why?

561
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,560
Like the farmer,
your lakes may have changed.

562
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,839
Then again, they might
not be there at all.

563
00:49:02,424 --> 00:49:05,353
But you're going to find out
when you get there.

564
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,040
That is certain.

565
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:29,057
Yes, it is done.
Just now.

566
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:31,585
Where was I?
Oh, yes.

567
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,456
There is only one way north.

568
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:36,920
If you go,
you cannot come back.

569
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:40,319
Chances are highly likely
you won't make it at all.

570
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:41,176
Hmm.

571
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:42,720
You need this.

572
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:47,079
It's uh...

573
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,760
It's old.
But it still works.

574
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:54,839
It measures radiation.

575
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,159
Yeah, I-I know what it's for.

576
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,942
What's-what's this?

577
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,822
It's a rabbit's foot.
You know, for luck.

578
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:15,679
Not for the rabbit.

579
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,640
I'm sure it was delicious.

580
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,640
The border is heavily fortified
from sea to sea.

581
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,880
There is no way over,
under or through it.

582
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:01,747
Mm-hmm.

583
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,400
No one knows what's on
the other side for sure, but

584
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,378
if you are determined,

585
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:11,200
first, you must go west
then north.

586
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,143
There will be no food or water.

587
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:16,800
Do not eat the snow,
as it will make you sick.

588
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,321
Now, anyone who
approaches you will be hostile.

589
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:22,674
So, don't be fooled by false smiles.

590
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,079
They will rape you and the boy.

591
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:29,999
You will go where
no one dares to go.

592
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,001
Now here, you will see the
Collingwood nuclear power station.

593
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:36,261
There was a meltdown
in reactors three and four.

594
00:51:36,357 --> 00:51:38,910
The government tried to hush it up,
but was unsuccessful.

595
00:51:39,003 --> 00:51:41,930
As a result, the area
is highly contaminated

596
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,473
with radioactive isotopes.

597
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:45,954
Nobody dares go near it.

598
00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:48,102
Oh, yes.

599
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,099
You will need this.

600
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:55,494
Iodine tablets.

601
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:58,510
The directions are on the label.

602
00:51:58,736 --> 00:52:00,371
You start taking them

603
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:02,799
as soon as you see the
reactor's cooling towers.

604
00:52:07,238 --> 00:52:08,360
Thank you.

605
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,742
Glock 18.

606
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,800
Nine millimeter.

607
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,362
Have you killed anyone?

608
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:35,964
Not yet.

609
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:37,860
But I will if I have to.

610
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,560
Amanda Douglas.

611
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:14,119
Will the real Rachel Weller
please stand up?

612
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,640
We'll die if we head north.
It's suicide.

613
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:33,680
We die if we stay here.

614
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,706
I'll tell them it was all my fault.

615
00:53:36,806 --> 00:53:38,519
I'll tell them whatever they want.

616
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:40,371
There's no going back.

617
00:53:40,836 --> 00:53:43,160
What you had
doesn't exist anymore.

618
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,294
You said New Eden
was a beginning.

619
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:48,920
Forget what I said.

620
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:52,440
Well, it can't be
worse than this.

621
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,360
W-why don't you just
try and get some sleep.

622
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,479
We got a long
journey ahead of us.

623
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,920
Mexican asters
don't grow anymore.

624
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:28,120
Hey, Lucas?
Where's your rabbit's foot?

625
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,439
My pocket.

626
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,000
- Don't lose it.
- I won't.

627
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:55,120
I come here once a month, Porter.

628
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,299
Whether I want to or not.

629
00:54:59,522 --> 00:55:00,920
It's a timeshare.

630
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,382
You'll hate me if you
knew how much it cost.

631
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,200
Um, so I ran the
ration card you gave me.

632
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,935
And according to our records,

633
00:55:10,034 --> 00:55:11,843
Amanda Douglas
died nine years ago.

634
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:13,579
The coroner's report?

635
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,959
Oh, uh, no, sir,
it was a famine year.

636
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,161
Mass burials were quite common.

637
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:19,560
Many deaths
weren't reported at all.

638
00:55:19,919 --> 00:55:21,429
Well, she's still alive, Porter.
We know it.

639
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:24,120
Amanda Douglas assumed
the identity of Rachel Weller.

640
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,960
I'm guessing she's just
lying in a mass grave somewhere.

641
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,964
But why assume the
identity of a dead woman?

642
00:55:32,064 --> 00:55:33,079
I don't know, Porter.

643
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:40,239
You should come in for a swim.

644
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:43,253
Um...

645
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,079
No, sir, I-I'll...

646
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,699
I'm afraid I-I'll drown, sir.

647
00:55:49,087 --> 00:55:51,665
It's a very real possibility.

648
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:56,399
This is a lost art, Porter.

649
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,160
The trick is to hold your breath
before you go under.

650
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:07,300
Mm.

651
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,359
How long was I asleep?

652
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:36,022
A few hours.

653
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,759
Where are we?

654
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:42,003
Somewhere west of North Dakota

655
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:44,679
on what's left of the I-94.

656
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:47,959
He talks in his sleep.

657
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:55,119
When he twitches like that,
means he's dreaming

658
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,399
What was his father like?

659
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:09,825
Um...

660
00:57:11,279 --> 00:57:13,939
He came. He stayed a week.
He left.

661
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,239
He was some city dweller.

662
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,743
Lucas never knew him.

663
00:57:19,294 --> 00:57:22,033
But lately, he's been
asking a lot of questions.

664
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,182
What do you tell him?

665
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,440
I make things up.

666
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,676
Fill in the blanks and...

667
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:35,435
I mean, he wants to hear
that he's a knight in shining armor.

668
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,119
What about you?
What's your story?

669
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:47,608
I assume you have one.
I mean, we all do.

670
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,579
My mother died when I was 12.

671
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,695
I was shipped off
to a state orphanage.

672
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,468
It wasn't a very nice place.

673
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:57,124
I don't remember my father.

674
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,565
But there was a man.
A friend of my mother's.

675
00:58:01,664 --> 00:58:03,392
He taught me how to fish.

676
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:15,919
I wonder what the world's
gonna be like when he grows up.

677
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,731
If he makes it that far.

678
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,319
When I was a boy, I couldn't
wait for summer vacation.

679
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:02,981
Lucas Weller, six pounds,
eight ounces.

680
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,400
Hello, Rachel.

681
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,840
Father: Unknown.
In lieu of kin: Amanda Douglas.

682
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:17,319
Relationship: Neighbor.

683
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,319
Your impostor is your neighbor.

684
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,662
Convenient.

685
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:52,253
I tell you to run,
you run for your life.

686
00:59:52,353 --> 00:59:54,639
You run and you don't look back.
You hear me?

687
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,156
Is it looking for us?

688
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:08,335
It's military.

689
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:11,637
I think it's replenishing
its solar cells.

690
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:13,367
It could stay up there for days.

691
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,236
What are we gonna do?

692
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:17,119
Stay put.
That's all we can do.

693
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,319
If you know a long story,
now would be the time to tell it.

694
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,400
It is circling.
It has teeth. I can see 'em.

695
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,714
Yeah, and a 20 mm minigun

696
01:00:25,814 --> 01:00:27,959
capable of firing
40 rounds per second.

697
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,839
- I have to pee.
- Hold it.

698
01:00:31,959 --> 01:00:33,371
I don't think it knows
we're down here.

699
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:35,359
If it did,
we'd be dead by now.

700
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,879
What have you got?

701
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:46,500
Um, sir, a military drone

702
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,326
has picked up on some
movement in a sector

703
01:00:48,426 --> 01:00:50,382
that hasn't seen
vehicle traffic in months.

704
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,959
There's somethin' down there.

705
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:53,599
Zoom in.

706
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,607
Um, we can't, sir.

707
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:58,912
We're borrowing the feed
from the military

708
01:00:59,012 --> 01:01:01,121
so we have no control
over the drone's functions.

709
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:04,578
Do they not know how
important this is, Porter?

710
01:01:04,678 --> 01:01:06,799
I don't think they care, sir.

711
01:01:06,919 --> 01:01:09,339
It's Kross. He's down there.
And I know it.

712
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:19,480
This car smells.

713
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,061
You think something died in here?

714
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:22,618
It's possible.

715
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:32,879
What's it doing?

716
01:01:32,979 --> 01:01:35,776
It's just making another
long, lazy circle, okay?

717
01:01:39,879 --> 01:01:41,222
Hey, don't.

718
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,679
Stop that, Lucas.

719
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,198
Um... okay.

720
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,391
Once upon a time,
there was,

721
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:53,647
in a land far, far away,
a giant.

722
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:55,062
And this giant...

723
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:58,227
Come on, this giant?

724
01:01:58,231 --> 01:02:00,647
It's a stupid game, Mom.
I'm not a little kid anymore.

725
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,537
I hate giants.
He died of sunstroke, okay?

726
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:05,468
The only thing worse right now

727
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,399
would be I spy
with my little eye.

728
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,599
I spy with my little eye
something white.

729
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,080
Do that again,
and I'll break your little arm.

730
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,560
Lucas, put that out!

731
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,435
You know what braves
at the Indian camp told me?

732
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,040
They're not real Indians, Lucas.

733
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:22,836
New Eden is a death camp.

734
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,267
What?

735
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,430
It's where millions of people
are burnt and turned into ash.

736
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,153
That's why they promise
to write but never do.

737
01:02:30,157 --> 01:02:32,399
because they don't
have any fingers or arms.

738
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:33,763
They're burned to a crisp.

739
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:35,976
Well, that is
a horrible thing to say.

740
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,825
It's true. First, they force you
into a gas chamber.

741
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:40,199
And then they burn you in an oven.

742
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:43,429
Happy endings only
happen in story books.

743
01:02:43,529 --> 01:02:46,079
The giants always stomp
on the little people.

744
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,663
Noah?

745
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:53,969
Noah, look at me.

746
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:56,359
Tell my son he's mistaken.

747
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,119
What am I lookin' at?

748
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:04,239
<i>New Eden.</i>

749
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:06,241
What is this?

750
01:03:06,341 --> 01:03:07,960
<i>Crematorium 6.</i>

751
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:09,662
Enhance.

752
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,800
What have we done?

753
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,839
There isn't enough food or water.

754
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:34,119
He's telling the truth.

755
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,799
Mom, look, the drone's gone.

756
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,302
That is a hell
of a secret to keep.

757
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:56,580
"Here's a pamphlet
that explains everything"?

758
01:03:56,668 --> 01:03:57,886
How do you sleep at night?

759
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:58,849
I don't sleep.

760
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,839
Why me? Why my son?
Why save us?

761
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:05,359
This is the Rachel Weller I knew.
Who are you?

762
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,852
So you finally came
to look for your son.

763
01:04:10,952 --> 01:04:13,560
What took you so long?

764
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,879
Is he everything you imagined?

765
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:18,528
Yes.

766
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:48,173
Shit.

767
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,039
Don't worry, kid.
Keep your heads down.

768
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,920
Get down, stay down.

769
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,314
Hey, you got your flashlight?

770
01:05:43,413 --> 01:05:45,399
Yes, mom, okay.
I gotta go, okay?

771
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:46,879
Be careful.

772
01:06:37,758 --> 01:06:38,813
Hello?

773
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:41,920
I said, hello.

774
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,763
You let him go in
a washroom on his own?

775
01:06:50,863 --> 01:06:52,199
You think that's wise?

776
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,158
I... It was number two.

777
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:56,880
He insisted. He's not
a little kid anymore.

778
01:06:56,999 --> 01:06:58,440
All right.
She's running hot.

779
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,199
There's gotta be some water
in those toilet tanks.

780
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,039
I'll check on Lucas
while I'm there.

781
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:30,719
It's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

782
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,720
The world can be a very
dangerous place, my little friend.

783
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:41,702
Lucas?

784
01:07:41,898 --> 01:07:42,884
Lucas?

785
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:48,930
Shit.

786
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,942
Run!

787
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,675
We can't leave without Lucas.

788
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:06,600
We're getting him back
right now.

789
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:21,239
Three's a crowd.
The sooner you figure that out,

790
01:08:21,338 --> 01:08:22,447
the better off you're gonna be.

791
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:24,576
You must think you're real tough,
picking on a little kid.

792
01:08:24,676 --> 01:08:27,479
So why don't you take a picture.
You can show all your friends.

793
01:08:29,559 --> 01:08:32,279
You little pickpocket.
Where is it?

794
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,640
It looks so real.

795
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:36,986
Give me that.

796
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:39,942
I'll get it.

797
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,062
Little brat.

798
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:50,823
What is the plan?

799
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:52,631
The plan is to get him
through the back door.

800
01:08:58,449 --> 01:08:59,600
Shit!

801
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:16,383
Oh, boy. Okay.

802
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:21,663
Um, sir.

803
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,691
What is it?

804
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:25,119
We found this.

805
01:09:33,999 --> 01:09:35,651
Thank you, Porter.

806
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,680
No problem, sir.

807
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,159
These instructions
were printed in 1951.

808
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:59,040
A rem is a unit
of ionizing radiation.

809
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,557
According to the
government of the day,

810
01:10:00,657 --> 01:10:03,799
exposure should not exceed
5,000 millirems per year.

811
01:10:03,919 --> 01:10:07,400
Exposure of 600,000
millirems is fatal.

812
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,160
You know, Rachel and I were...
we were friends.

813
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,600
We lived up the road
from each other.

814
01:10:21,919 --> 01:10:26,640
Lucas was two,
and Rachel wanted to sell him.

815
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,559
She wanted to sell her little boy.

816
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,075
You need to understand

817
01:10:34,175 --> 01:10:37,040
that people were eating
their neighbors then.

818
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:42,560
But you know,
Lucas was...

819
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,680
He was just so beautiful.
I couldn't let that happen.

820
01:10:52,183 --> 01:10:56,240
And we fought and...

821
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,240
You know, there was an accident.

822
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,157
Lucas thinks you're his mother.

823
01:11:14,257 --> 01:11:16,199
I <i>am</i> his mother.

824
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:22,289
I am his mother.
I love him. I protect him.

825
01:11:22,389 --> 01:11:24,953
I-I would do anything for him.

826
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:30,013
You know, I worry every single day

827
01:11:30,113 --> 01:11:32,119
what this world
is gonna do to him.

828
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,000
But what about...

829
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:48,520
Are you gonna tell him
you're his father?

830
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,291
What-what am I gonna do?

831
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:55,738
I'm gonna say I'm his dad.

832
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:57,400
That you're not his real mom, or...

833
01:11:57,519 --> 01:11:59,497
Or-or we did know each other,

834
01:11:59,597 --> 01:12:01,759
but we were just
acting like we didn't?

835
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,919
Do you think he's
ready for the truth?

836
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,040
That lake had better be there.

837
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,399
Two thousand
millirems.

838
01:13:08,519 --> 01:13:10,640
- How bad is that?
- It's not good.

839
01:13:10,879 --> 01:13:13,065
All right, uh,
go back to the car.

840
01:13:13,165 --> 01:13:14,959
Make sure Lucas doesn't get out.

841
01:13:24,599 --> 01:13:26,501
How you doing back there, champ?

842
01:13:27,176 --> 01:13:29,160
I'll let you know
if my hair falls out.

843
01:13:37,759 --> 01:13:39,141
Tell me about the lake.

844
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:40,695
Tell me how you learned to fish.

845
01:13:41,072 --> 01:13:42,878
You've heard it a hundred times.

846
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:44,479
I-I wanna hear it again.

847
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:46,019
There's nothing left to tell.

848
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:47,879
Why don't you tell <i>me</i> a story.

849
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:50,563
I haven't done anything
worth telling.

850
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,679
Will you teach me
how to fish?

851
01:13:54,599 --> 01:13:56,439
Let's get there first.

852
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,359
I have a nosebleed.

853
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:10,003
Ugh.

854
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:15,259
Is my hair falling out?

855
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:18,160
No. You look
as handsome as ever.

856
01:14:19,999 --> 01:14:21,766
I get nosebleeds sometimes.

857
01:14:23,223 --> 01:14:24,368
He'll be fine.

858
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,600
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

859
01:14:35,799 --> 01:14:37,142
When you're ready, sir.

860
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:42,119
Kross seems to have adapted well
to life outside the city.

861
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,382
He's running towards his past.

862
01:14:46,537 --> 01:14:48,279
The idea of something better.

863
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,719
It'll lead him nowhere, sir.

864
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,903
Perhaps.

865
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:00,359
But if we all ran,
who would keep our secret?

866
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,480
Well, it's possible some are
too big to keep, sir.

867
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:07,982
I agree.

868
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,134
You can't kill seven million people
and get away with it.

869
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:14,199
Eventually, you'll be found out.

870
01:15:17,879 --> 01:15:20,239
We're on the wrong side
of history, Porter.

871
01:15:35,777 --> 01:15:37,932
Hey, the last page is missing.

872
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:39,880
Yeah, it's in my pocket.

873
01:15:41,919 --> 01:15:43,790
It's got my nuclear
submarine on it.

874
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,239
As soon as I save six bucks,
I'm gonna order one.

875
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:53,818
You know this is
80 years old, right?

876
01:15:53,822 --> 01:15:57,550
- I know.
- Yeah? Okay.

877
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:00,870
Thanks.

878
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,469
Here.
You need some water?

879
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:08,622
Uh, no thanks.

880
01:16:13,999 --> 01:16:15,401
Two millirems.

881
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,196
That's standard
background radiation.

882
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:18,457
We could see
the cooling towers.

883
01:16:18,557 --> 01:16:20,950
This needle should be posted
to the top of the meter.

884
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,079
You wanna hand me
that lantern?

885
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,222
Smart.

886
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:49,600
It's two millirems.

887
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,382
We're safe.

888
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,720
Why would they say there's radiation
when there's none?

889
01:16:55,204 --> 01:16:57,039
Mom, why would they
scare us like that?

890
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,199
Because it's easier to build fear
than build a wall.

891
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,582
Let's go.

892
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:27,383
I spy with my little eye
something green.

893
01:17:27,483 --> 01:17:28,915
A tree.

894
01:17:29,004 --> 01:17:31,079
I've never seen so many.

895
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,553
Maybe we're dead
and we don't know it.

896
01:17:34,557 --> 01:17:37,006
Maybe the afterlife
is stuffed full of trees.

897
01:17:37,097 --> 01:17:39,064
Lucas.

898
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,639
Uh, what does that
red light mean?

899
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,320
Forget it,
I think I know.

900
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:03,559
Run! Run!

901
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,320
He thinks he's home free.

902
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,360
That was close.

903
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,759
Help us, please.
Help us.

904
01:18:17,282 --> 01:18:18,912
Come on, please.

905
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,000
I will shoot you in the back!

906
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:37,039
You have no jurisdiction here.

907
01:18:37,999 --> 01:18:40,587
You know, this place just looks
more impressive on a map.

908
01:18:40,974 --> 01:18:42,440
It's a nice spot.

909
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,037
How'd you know
there's no radiation?

910
01:18:45,712 --> 01:18:47,079
I didn't.

911
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,030
It takes balls, Noah.

912
01:18:50,514 --> 01:18:52,159
This road leads nowhere.

913
01:18:52,551 --> 01:18:53,697
Never did.

914
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:55,959
You should've known that.

915
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,479
I will take that.

916
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,615
All right, look,

917
01:19:07,231 --> 01:19:08,830
Nobody needs to know
what you've done here.

918
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:11,643
Just return what you've stolen.
We'll redeem your reputation.

919
01:19:12,349 --> 01:19:13,679
You can start over.

920
01:19:20,919 --> 01:19:22,599
You know, unfortunately, I-I...

921
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,240
I only have
the one return ticket.

922
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:27,145
No!

923
01:19:27,437 --> 01:19:28,587
Mom!

924
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,192
You are not a hero, Noah.

925
01:19:36,483 --> 01:19:38,160
And you will never be.

926
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,719
Give me the memory card.

927
01:19:41,639 --> 01:19:45,680
You want the memory card?
Let the boy go free.

928
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,440
Let him go, Adam.

929
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,679
He's a child.

930
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,999
This isn't his fight.

931
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,299
He's not a child.
He's a monster.

932
01:20:01,495 --> 01:20:03,640
And I should take your eye out.

933
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,303
All right, run.

934
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,747
Go, before I change my mind.

935
01:20:14,847 --> 01:20:16,720
Give me the memory card.

936
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,239
Go! Get out of here. Go!

937
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:21,360
- Come here.
- Get out, run!

938
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:29,720
He doesn't know you're his father.

939
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:30,554
No.

940
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,119
Probably for the better.

941
01:20:57,639 --> 01:20:59,159
It's empty.

942
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:01,280
It's blank!

943
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:03,399
It's empty!

944
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,102
He told you to run.
Do you not listen?

945
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:41,078
That'll do, that'll do.

946
01:21:41,178 --> 01:21:43,035
That'll do,
you little monster.

947
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,398
Yes, I'm certain it's Kross.

948
01:22:00,785 --> 01:22:02,375
There's trouble.

949
01:22:03,328 --> 01:22:04,461
Mom.

950
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:09,820
Mom.

951
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:22,679
You can find me.

952
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,119
I've been waiting
almost a week for Noah.

953
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,269
And that memory card
he gave Agent Westinghouse

954
01:22:58,465 --> 01:22:59,920
was blank?

955
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,520
Did Noah give you anything?

956
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,040
<i>New Eden is a death factory.</i>

957
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:52,760
<i>A 20-square-acre gas chamber
containing six crematories.</i>

958
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,032
<i>These are the
faces of the innocent.</i>

959
01:23:55,036 --> 01:23:58,874
<i>The seven million victims
of state-sanctioned genocide.</i>

960
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,327
<i>Be scared.</i>

961
01:24:00,427 --> 01:24:02,292
<i>Be very scared.</i>

962
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,791
<i>You may be next.</i>

963
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,480
<i>Let the revolution begin.</i>

964
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,688
Where are you going?

965
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:27,720
To the city. All of us.

966
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:31,039
There is a revolution.
Haven't you heard?

967
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,799
What the hell is goin' on?

968
01:25:07,461 --> 01:25:09,477
Oh, shit!

969
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:37,240
When I was a boy, I couldn't
wait for summer vacation.

970
01:25:43,325 --> 01:25:46,394
♪ I've done the math
calibrated the imperfections ♪

971
01:25:46,493 --> 01:25:48,954
♪ I got my slide rule
from school ♪
