Oh, hi, honey.

35
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:17,672
You got a plastic bag for
just one carton of milk?

36
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:19,544
What? They just give it to you.

37
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:21,670
You could say you don't need it.

38
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:23,091
Oh, pour me some of that too.

39
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,340
Dad, I got ice tea. Do you want some?

40
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:26,721
Ah, sounds good.

41
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:29,147
I'll have it at the table.

42
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:32,438
- Thanks. Done with the computer?
- I'm printing out now.

43
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:36,023
Maybe we should buy another laptop.

44
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:39,190
Smells like cigarettes in here.

45
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:42,445
Shizuku, you should have
gone to Kashiwazaki too.

46
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,143
No, I didn't want to. Shiho wears me out.

47
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,906
Oh, by the way, I have to work tomorrow.

48
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,126
- Do you want me to fix you a lunch?
- That's OK. I'll eat out.

49
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:55,298
The library's computerizing everything.
Everybody's going crazy at work.

50
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:59,214
I don't think they should, Dad.
Card catalogs are much better.

51
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,755
Yeah. I like 'em better too.

52
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,842
I think you've got a
problem with your report.

53
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,726
- What's the problem?
- Isn't there a line missing here?

54
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,139
You're right. Darn.

55
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,387
I'll have to print the entire thing over.

56
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,607
Can't I use the printer first?
My professor will kill me

57
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,900
if I don't have his paper
turned in tomorrow.

58
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,152
Seiji Amasawa.

59
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,239
Here he is again.

60
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:24,452
Shizuku, time to put the
books away and go to bed.

61
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,162
OK, Dad. Good night.

62
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,340
Yep. I knew I had seen that name before.

63
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,446
Here it is again.

64
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,088
And again.

65
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,550
Seiji Amasawa.

66
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:47,186
Seiji Amasawa.

67
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,940
Seiji Amasawa. That's amazing.

68
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:52,660
This guy checked out all
these books before I did.

69
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:01,651
Seiji Amasawa, huh?

70
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,404
What kind of person are you?

71
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,680
I wonder if we're anything alike.

72
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:24,340
Shizuku!

73
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:26,142
For heaven sakes, get up!

74
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:29,185
I'm leaving.

75
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,350
Hey, did you sleep in your clothes again?

76
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,276
You're so scatterbrained.

77
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:36,794
Have a good day.

78
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,538
Aah! Is it that late? I'm
supposed to meet Yuko.

79
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,775
Ugh! My wallet!

80
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,546
Did you get all the way
down the stairs again, Mom?

81
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:51,827
Yes!

82
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:54,087
Where is it?

83
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,838
Is it by the telephone?

84
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,778
- Found it!
- You always leave it there.

85
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:01,343
I'm gonna be late!

86
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,054
- Don't forget to lock up!
- Who's scatterbrained?

87
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,934
Wow! I've never seen a blimp so close.

88
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,446
Today's gonna be great.

89
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:49,038
Hot day.

90
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:58,046
Hi, Yappy.

91
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:00,091
Can't you bark any louder than that?

92
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,020
Shizuku! Shizuku! Hey, there.

93
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:28,193
Hey, Michiko. Good luck
on your match today.

94
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:33,589
Hi, Miss Kosaka. Can I come in?

95
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:36,690
Oh, hi, Shizuku. What are you doing here?

96
00:06:37,078 --> 00:06:38,904
I need you to do me a favor.

97
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:41,409
What? It's not something weird, is it?

98
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:44,286
- Can you open the library, please?
- The library?

99
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:46,848
Can't you wait until school starts?

100
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:48,745
No. That's the point.

101
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:51,751
I decided I was gonna read 20
books over summer vacation,

102
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:53,911
and the city library doesn't
have the book I want.

103
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,462
It'll just be a second.

104
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:58,721
Twenty books? What about your
high school entrance exams?

105
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:01,135
Can't you even pretend
to be studying for them?

106
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:02,841
Uh, here it is.

107
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:05,558
Hurry up and bring it here.

108
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,313
Come on, give me your library card
and the checkout card from the book.

109
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,448
Here you go.

110
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,996
Hey, look at this.

111
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,361
No one's ever checked this book out before.

112
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,439
No one? What do you know.

113
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:20,566
I finally beat Seiji Amasawa.

114
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:30,072
Donated by... Amasawa?

115
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:34,249
No way! Do you have any idea
who this Amasawa person is?

116
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,091
Oh, now look, you made me make a mistake.

117
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,511
Well, that guy's probably the book's donor.

118
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:41,510
I don't know anyone from that long ago.

119
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:44,007
- Ask one of the older teachers.
- Shizuku!

120
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:47,191
I should have known you
were going to do this.

121
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,549
You said to meet outside
the school, not inside.

122
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:53,751
I waited in the sun for 15 minutes. Do
you know how many freckles I have now?

123
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,249
- I'm sorry.
- Calm down, Yuko.

124
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:58,318
You take your freckles way too seriously.

125
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:01,217
No, I don't! It's a major problem for me.

126
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,745
Aren't either of you
concerned about your exams?

127
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:05,779
Now get out and go study.

128
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:08,438
I got it!

129
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:11,670
Here! This way.

130
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:14,010
Kick it harder than that.

131
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,848
I wrote some lyrics for

132

00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:33,660
Is there something bothering you?

162
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:37,309
Mmm. Do you think about boys?

163
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:38,833
No.

164
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:41,627
We're all studying for exams
and we could help each other.

165
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:45,207
It would be nice to be with someone
who felt the same way about you.

166
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:48,592
Yuko, you have a crush on someone.

167
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:53,009
- You got a love letter?!
- Ahh! Shh! Not so loud.

168
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:55,352
So, what's he like? Is he good-looking?

169
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,764
He's from another class.

170
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:59,890
- Uh, he's sort of good-looking.
- Why not try dating him?

171
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:01,815
If you don't like him you can stop.

172
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:03,188
Yeah, but...

173
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,591
You've got a crush on
someone else, don't you?

174
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:12,699
Don't even try to hide it. You
know I'll get it out of you.

175
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,032
It's, uh, Su... Su...

176
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,829
Shizuku!

177
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,815
Can you throw me my bag?

178
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:22,402
Sugimura.

179
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:25,289
It's that blue one, on
the bench over there.

180
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,674
Come on! Hurry it up!

181
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:30,297
I got to get back to the game.

182
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,864
Calm down, bench warmer.
You never play anyway.

183
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,657
Hey, I play all the time,

184
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,054
and our team's going to the
playoffs, I'll have you know.

185
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
Yuko?

186
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:50,089
Are you OK?

187
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,404
So I guess Sugimura is the guy you like.

188
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,387
How embarrassing. I ran
off like a little girl.

189
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:01,222
- He must know now.
- No way, Yuko. He's way too dense.

190
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:04,312
But what about the guy who
wrote you the love letter?

191
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:06,003
I think you should go for him.

192
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:10,692
Hmm, I don't know. I want to think it over.

193
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,324
All right.

194
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,087
You're lucky, Shizuku.

195
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:17,288
Your parents don't bug you
to study all the time.

196
00:11:17,616 --> 00:11:21,234
- Sometimes I wish they did.
- Hmm, yeah.

197
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,583
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

198
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,878
I lost my book. I must have dropped it.

199
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,730
- You want to ride my bike?
- No!

200
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:29,710
You'll be late for cram school.

201
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:32,670
- Call me later, OK?
- I will!

202
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:12,841
You've got my book.

203
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:15,882
Oh. This is yours, is it?

204
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:23,266
Here you go, Shizuku Tsukishima.

205
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:25,355
What? How do you know my name?

206
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:27,903
Gee, take a wild guess.

207
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:31,486
Oh, the checkout card.

208
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:32,894
By the way, great lyrics.

209
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,652
They're even cornier than
the original version.

210
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,285
You read this?!

211
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
Stupid jerk, stupid jerk, stupid jerk.

212
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:49,666
Stupid jerk, stupid jerk, stupid jerk!

213
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,513
Stupid jerk!

214
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:08,319
"It's even cornier than
the original version."

215
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,058
Stupid jerk!

216
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:50,822
Hey, I'm home!

217
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:54,702
Oh, hey, sis. You're back early.

218
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:57,029
Ahh, I'm beat.

219
00:13:58,082 --> 00:14:01,466
I grabbed a ride with someone
who's going back to Tokyo.

220
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:04,050
Where's Mom?

221
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:07,675
She's at an intensive summer course.
Dad's still at work.

222
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,252
You need to clean up this room, Shizuku,

223
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,406
and you should have started dinner by now.

224
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:15,762
- I was just getting to it.
- Ugh! This kitchen is a disaster!

225
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:17,451
Have you cleaned anything since I left?

226
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,384
Relax, I'll do it now.

227
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:25,721
You need to stay on top of this
while Mom's got classes, Shizuku.

228
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:32,951
After you wash the rice
finish up the laundry.

229
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,448
I'll help you make dinner
after I take a shower.

230
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:40,117
Auntie said you should come visit
her after you finish your exams.

231
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,123
Hmm.

232
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,666
- Are you studying?
- Uh-huh.

233
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,876
You're gonna have big
problems if you slack off

234
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:48,339
just because Dad and Mom
don't bug you about it.

235
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:50,222
I'm studying, OK?

236
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,707
You know, she tried to get me to
bring home some of her soy sauce.

237
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:57,002
That's your aunt, all right.

238
00:14:57,224 --> 00:14:59,408
Didn't the same thing happen last year?

239
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:02,368
She made me take home some miso.
Really heavy.

240
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:03,502
Five pounds.

241
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,976
Too bad Shizuku couldn't go with you.

242
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,913
Shizuku, come on, get up.

243
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:24,042
Vacuum your side of the room.

244
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,515
Then strip the bed, 'cause
I'm washing the sheets.

245
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:28,479
I'm doing the futons too.

246
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:33,198
- Hey, where's Mom?
- She left hours ago.

247
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:40,336
Clear the table when you're done then
take Dad's lunch to him at the library.

248
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:43,143
- Hey!
- What do you mean "hey"?

249
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:45,273
You're going to the library already.

250
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:48,149
Or do you want me to go instead?

251
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,394
Then you can clean the toilet,
the bathroom and the entryway.

252
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,272
Then you can go to the grocery
store, fold the laundry,

253
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,279
make the beds and cook dinner.
How does that sound?

254
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:02,928
See you later! Phew!

255
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,457
Shizuku!

256
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:13,158
Put this in the mailbox for me.

257
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,681
What is it?

258
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,368
Uh, it's mail, stupid.

259
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:24,604
You don't need to read it.

260
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:27,110
Can't you just put it in the mailbox?

261
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:30,941
- It's a love letter, isn't it?
- Shut up!

262
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,199
I don't know how I'm gonna pass this.

263
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,161
You gotta read some books.

264
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:06,896
<i>Next stop Suginomiya Station.</i>

265
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,692
<i>Suginomiya Station.</i>

266
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:28,545
Hey there, cat. You all alone?

267
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:34,705
So, where are you headed?

268
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:39,891
See something interesting?

269
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,953
Oh, the silent treatment.

270
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:58,833
This is my stop. How about you?

271
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,963
So long, snotty.

272
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:13,199
Hey!

273
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,601
He's headed towards the library.

274
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,107
I'll call you later, all right?

275
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:09,117
I finally thought I was gonna get
a little adventure around here.

276
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,487
Hey!

277
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,589
Oh!

278
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,585
What a steep climb.

279
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,511
How far does this thing go?

280
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,712
Here, kitty.

281
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:07,910
Here, kitty.

282
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:14,659
He must live around here somewhere.

283
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:33,921
Hey!

284
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,634
Where are you going, you crazy cat?

285
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,326
Do you live around here?

286
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,514
What a gorgeous neighborhood.

287
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:14,144
I never knew there was a
place like this up here.

288
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,296
No way.

289
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:36,960
He came all this way
just to tease that dog?

290
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:52,388
Hmm. I wonder if that cat
isn't messing with me too.

291
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:58,278
An antique shop?

292
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:00,361
He's going shopping now?

293
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:48,452
Incredible. I had no idea there
were stores like this around here.

294
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:19,062
What a fantastic statue.

295
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:29,167
You're not the cat I was
following, are you?

296
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,422
- Oh, hello there.
- I'm sorry.

297
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:45,613
No, please, it's good to have visitors.

298
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:47,409
Look around as much as you like.

299
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:49,369
The Baron is bored too.

300
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:53,964
The Baron? Is that the name
of the statue over here?

301
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,129
Yeah. Baron Humbert von Joekkingen.

302
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,301
Good name, don't you think?

303
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,169
Oh, thanks.

304
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:12,479
Don't worry, though. I
do this all the time.

305
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:13,767
Great clock.

306
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:17,955
It was found in an abandoned
castle all covered with rust.

307
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:19,428
Look at this.

308
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:26,199
Beautiful. So, what does it do?

309
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:31,033
It might not do anything.

310
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,878
I just finished restoring this.

311
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,125
I haven't tried it out yet.

312
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:13,800
Dwarfs in a jewel mine,
just like a fairy tale.

313
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,176
You like fairy tales.

314
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:19,347
This clock has a terribly romantic
fairy tale that goes with it.

315
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:22,967
Watch what happens on the clock face...

316
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,475
At least I hope something happens.

317
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:44,077
What is that?

318
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:47,119
Stand up here on the ladder,
then you can see better.

319
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:48,691
OK.

320
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:53,959
Oh, it's a fairy.

321
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:58,096
She is now, but soon she'll
turn back into a sheep.

322
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:06,645
The two of them are in love, aren't they?

323
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,312
Mm-hmm. But they are always apart.

324
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,816
He's king of the dwarfs
and lives underground

325
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:14,698
while she's cursed to live as a sheep.

326
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:17,529
Only while the clock strikes
12:00 is she a fairy.

327
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,860
So the king appears at that moment

328
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:23,116
just to catch a glimpse of the
girl he fell in love with.

329
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,577
What do you bet that the
artisan who made this clock

330
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:29,330
was separated from the love of his life?

331
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:33,710
That must be why their
sadness feels so real.

332
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,345
That clock isn't on time, is it?

333
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,763
No. It's about five minutes too slow.

334
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,928
- Oh, no!
- Whoa!

335
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:47,018
I've got to get to the library!

336
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:49,783
I'm sorry, do you mind
if I come again later?

337
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:53,619
Sure. But it's better to go
left to get to the library.

338
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:08,499
Oh, good! I'm right above the library.

339
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:14,303
What a great place that was.

340
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,598
It was like straight out of a fairy tale.

341
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:20,397
That was amazing!

342
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:24,055
Shizuku Tsukishima!

343
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:28,975
Hey, this is yours, isn't it?

344
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,061
Huh? Aah!

345
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:32,525
Uh...

346
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:35,984
You're kind of forgetful, aren't you?

347
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,148
Uh, thanks, but how did you get this?

348
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:39,981
Take a wild guess.

349
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:44,207
That man, do you know him?

350
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:45,372
Is he your grandpa?

351
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:47,917
You must eat like a pig.
That lunch is enormous.

352
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:49,329
Huh?

353
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,337
Hey you!

354
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:54,878
♪ <i>Concrete roads Everywhere I go</i> ♪

355
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,465
It's my dad's, you jerk!

356
00:29:00,478 --> 00:29:02,719
Hey, thanks. You brought my lunch.

357
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:07,979
What's wrong? Why the sour face?

358
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,024
- It's hard to explain.
- And?

359
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:14,904
I was having an extraordinary day,
like I was living in a fairy tale,

360
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,144
then some jerk talked to me for two
seconds and ruined everything.

361
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:20,799
Sounds complicated.

362
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,832
Are you going to check
out some books today?

363
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:26,063
Yeah. I just have seven more to go.

364
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:29,177
You never stop reading. You want
to take some time out for lunch?

365
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:32,428
- I'll eat later.
- OK, then. See you later.

366
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:56,747
Seiji Amasawa.

367
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,936
Wow. Is there any book here
this guy hasn't checked out?

368
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,914
I wonder what kind of person he is.

369
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:09,625
No way! Not that jerk!

370
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:14,492
Shh!

371
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:36,370
Aah!

372
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:05,105
Shizuku, hurry up!

373
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:08,645
Oh! We're going to be late!

374
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:10,503
Hurry, get the umbrellas.

375
00:31:13,494 --> 00:31:16,115
The first day of the
semester and it has to rain.

376
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:18,323
Stop complaining.

377
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,488
You're going to school because you want to.

378
00:31:20,602 --> 00:31:22,796
- Yes, ma'am.
- Study hard.

379
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,546
You can count on me.

380
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:34,931
- Shizuku!
- Hey, Yuko!

381
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,549
Hurry up! I don't want to
be late for our first day.

382
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:40,391
I can't believe how many
tests we have to take.

383
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,812
It's one thing or another every day.

384
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:50,069
- So, did you answer the letter?
- Mm-mmm.

385
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,699
Have you made up your mind yet?

386
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,360
Yeah. I decided I don't
want to go out with him.

387
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:58,072
OK. Yeah, maybe that's best.

388
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,855
Sugimura!

389
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,665
You're gonna be late!

390
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,829
Calm down, we know!

391
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:16,844
OK, everybody, pencils down.

392
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:25,172
- Regular classes this afternoon.
- Hey, Jun, Daizo.

393
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:27,217
Let's eat fast so we can get outside.

394
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,778
Let's eat lunch in Miss
Kosaka's office, OK?

395
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,644
Can we stop by the teachers' lounge first?

396
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,258
- I guess so.
- Hey, Shizuku, check it out!

397
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:38,077
- What?
- I totally aced that test.

398
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,447
Well, good for you.

399
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:42,829
Everything I studied was on the
test and I barely studied.

400
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:45,294
So you're not just a
bench warmer after all.

401
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:47,590
Yuko's good at guessing what's on tests.

402
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:50,804
- You should study with her sometime.
- Study with her?

403
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:52,970
- Sugimura, Sugimura!
- What's up?

404
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,976
- Did you see this?
- Let's go, Shizuku.

405
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:03,076
I can't believe you said that, Shizuku.

406
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,197
What's the problem?

407
00:33:04,203 --> 00:33:06,740
I've never been good at
guessing what's on tests.

408
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:07,854
Sorry.

409
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,492
Excuse us.

410
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:15,245
You want to know who donated a book?

411
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:17,333
I don't think I'd remember
something like that.

412
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,358
I hate to interrupt you
while you're eating.

413
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,875
- Look at this stamp here.
- Hmm? Well...

414
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:24,293
Let's see.

415
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:31,222
Oh, Dr. Amasawa, sure. I've read this
book too. It's quite a good one.

416
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:32,850
Yes, it's great.

417
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:35,944
So, is there anything that you
can tell me about Dr. Amasawa?

418
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,729
Let me see if I can remember.

419
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,926
I think he was chairman of the PTA.

420
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:41,306
The PTA, huh?

421
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:44,097
Would you happen to remember Dr.
Amasawa's first name?

422
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:46,150
First name? Let's see.

423
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:50,113
Mr. Kimura, do you happen to remember Dr.
Amasawa's first name?

424
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,788
Dr. Amasawa. I'm pretty sure it's Koichi.
Koichi Amasawa.

425
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,786
Koichi Amasawa.

426
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,959
Shizuku, Dr. Amasawa's
son goes to school here.

427
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:01,624
There's a chance you could have met him.
He's in your grade.

428
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,865
Huh? Uh... I...

429
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:05,947
I gotta go. Thank you very much!

430
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:08,387
Uh, excuse us.

431
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:10,763
Oh! Excuse me.

432
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:15,643
Shizuku! What's wrong with you?

433
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,852
It can't be him.

434
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:21,146
What in the world are you talking about?

435
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:24,313
You are acting like a total weirdo.

436
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:26,860
I'm sorry.

437
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,707
Shizuku, now what are you doing?

438
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,856
What a complete jerk! Do you
know what that guy's name is?

439
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:59,269
No. He's not in our class.
What's the big deal?

440
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:02,336
That jerk better not be Dr. Amasawa's son.

441
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:06,528
Shizuku chasing down boys?
I don't believe it.

442
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,326
I had to run after her
carrying her lunchbox.

443
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,819
So Shizuku has a crush on someone, eh?

444
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:15,750
Miss Kosaka, can you believe
she's finally interested

445
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:17,184
in something other than a book?

446
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,080
- I'm not interested. He's a jerk!
- What if he checked out those books?

447
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,433
- He's your perfect match.
- Like a fairy tale.

448
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:26,298
If it's him, it's a horror story.

449
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:30,432
So, tell us, what's the name of this guy
who checked out all the books, Yuko?

450
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:33,820
- Yuko.
- I can't remember exactly.

451
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:37,076
There was a "ma" in it,
or maybe it was a "wa."

452
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:40,054
Ama... Just say it, Shizuku!

453
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:43,059
- No way.
- Shizuku is such a great storyteller,

454
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:46,086
but now that the story is about
her, she won't say a word.

455
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:49,092
You can't hide the fact
you're in love, Shizuku.

456
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:52,716
The look on your face shows your
heart suffers with every beat.

457
00:35:52,803 --> 00:35:56,387
How romantic. You are in love.

458
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:59,219
Go ahead, make fun of me if you want to.

459
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:02,394
Too bad. I was gonna show you
my lyrics for <i>Country Roads.</i>

460
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:04,851
- You're finished?
- Let me see! Let me see!

461
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:10,481
Great Shizuku, master of writing,
we shall make fun of you no more.

462
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:13,323
- Please grace us with your words.
- That's better.

463
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,198
I don't know if it's any good, though.

464
00:36:17,162 --> 00:36:20,358
And it might not be
appropriate for graduation.

465
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:22,613
I just tried to write
something from the heart.

466
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:24,992
This is so good, Shizuku.

467

475
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,661
The lyrics aren't too corny?

476
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,126
No. They're wonderful.

477
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,250
You really have a gift for writing.

478
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,339
Reading all those books
actually did her some good.

479
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:58,976
- You sure they're OK?
- They're from the heart.

480
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:01,583
Yeah. I really like this part:

481
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:03,907
"I dreamed of living alone but fearless."

482
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,221
Secret longing to be courageous.

483
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:08,352
"Loneliness kept bottled up inside..."

484
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:11,734
- Ladies, that's the bell.
- Yes, ma'am.

485
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,819
Ahh! I love being a writer!

486
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,403
Shizuku!

487
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,557
Do you want to come with
us to the glee club?

488
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:26,898
- We're gonna show them your lyrics.
- No, thanks.

489
00:37:26,904 --> 00:37:28,953
I want to check out some
books from the library.

490
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,372
More books? We've got a
test tomorrow, you know.

491
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:34,130
- I'll study when I get home.
- Yeah, right.

492
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,046
- See you later.
- See ya!

493
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:13,694
Hey, Yuko.

494
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:19,546
Uh, sorry to bother you
but, uh, can we talk?

495
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:22,799
Mm-hmm.

496
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:32,204
I was afraid it would be closed.

497
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:34,731
I hope that old man's doing all right.

498
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,251
The Baron's gone.

499
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:51,016
Someone must have bought him.

500
00:38:57,259 --> 00:39:00,147
"Mr. Nishi's Antique Shop."

501
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:01,772
Oh, thank goodness.

502
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:04,399
That jerk's name isn't Amasawa. It's Nishi.

503
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:20,116
Shizuku!

504
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:22,734
Shizuku, Yuko's on the phone.

505
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:26,179
Hey!

506
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,628
Phone call. Can't you hear anything?

507
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:31,406
I keep telling you you're
gonna ruin your hearing.

508
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,133
Hello? What?

509
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,499
I can't really hear you.

510
00:39:36,593 --> 00:39:39,633
Mm-hmm. Don't worry about it, Yuko.

511
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,632
Mm-hmm. I'll be right there.

512
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:44,548
- Where are you going?
- Just down the street.

513
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:54,892
- Yuko, what happened?
- Shizuku.

514
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,269
What is it? Why... Why are you crying?

515
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:00,319
I talked to Sugimura,

516
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:02,843
and he's friends with the guy
who wrote me that letter,

517
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:06,053
so he tried to convince me
to go out with his friend.

518
00:40:07,668 --> 00:40:08,867
What?

519
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,268
Go out with your friend? How
could you say that to me?!

520
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:17,666
What?

521
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:22,719
That jerk. I can't believe
he's that stupid.

522
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:24,932
But I don't think he did it to hurt you.

523
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:27,484
He's just a dope. He has
no idea that you like him.

524
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:31,343
I better apologize to him, I guess.

525
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:34,756
But there's no way I can go to school
with my face looking like this.

526
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:36,463
I'm going to have to stay home tomorrow.

527
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:39,282
- We've got tests, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:41,874
OK.

529
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:02,088
Idiot.

530
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:06,061
What did I do?

531
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,102
That was pretty easy, huh?

532
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:12,691
- Headed to the library again?
- No. I'm gonna go check on Yuko.

533
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:14,259
Oh, tell her I hope she feels better.

534
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,459
- I will. See ya.
- Bye-bye.

535
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,203
Shizuku!

536
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,876
Wait up!

537
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:30,582
Whoa!

538
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,632
I need to talk to you about Yuko.

539
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:46,014
And then all of a sudden she
starts crying her head off.

540
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,917
So, what did I say that
was so terrible, huh?

541
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:51,736
Just think about it.

542
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:54,270
Remember when Yuko said,
"Date your friend?"

543
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:56,316
- "How could you say that to me?"
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:59,053
All I said was he's a good guy.
She should give him a chance.

545
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:00,831
Get a clue!

546
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:03,947
What Yuko was saying was that she
didn't want to hear that from you.

547
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:07,455
- You know what that means, don't you?
- I don't speak girl code!

548
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:09,253
Why don't you spell it out for me?

549
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:11,783
I can't believe you're this dense!

550
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:14,547
What it means is Yuko has a crush on you.

551
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:18,467
What? Are you sure? I
didn't pick up on that.

552
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:21,579
Are you blind? She stayed
home from school, you know.

553
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:24,029
She even missed a test on account of you.

554
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:27,931
But, it's that... You're
the one I'm in love with!

555
00:42:29,322 --> 00:42:30,800
What? Come on,

556
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:32,363
quit joking around, will you?

557
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:36,195
I'm not joking. I've been in love with
you for years. Haven't you noticed?

558
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:40,287
But you can't fall for me.
That just doesn't happen.

559
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:43,539
Don't you like me at all? Or is
there someone else you love?

560
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:46,012
I'm not in love with anybody,

561
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:49,685
but Yuko, she'll... I gotta go!

562
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:52,000
Wait a minute! Forget Yuko!

563
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:53,213
Do you like me?

564
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:55,639
Of course I like you. We've
been friends for years.

565
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:59,809
But Yuko and I are best friends, so
that's the way it's gonna stay, OK?

566
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:05,001
You understand? Or do I have
to spell it out some more?

567
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:13,446
No. I understand.

568
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:15,888
We'll just be friends.

569
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,976
I'm sorry. I'll never mention it again.

570
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:13,690
You idiot!

571
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:16,003
You're the one who's dense.

572
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:27,835
Oh, Mrs. Tsukishima, I've
got a package for you.

573
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:29,153
The mailman left it with me.

574
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:31,484
Oh, thanks. Sorry to trouble you.

575
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,564
Thanks so much for these.

576
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:49,240
No problem. There's way
too much for us to eat.

577
00:44:50,415 --> 00:44:52,267
Oh, you're home.

578
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:54,051
Shizuku.

579
00:46:15,036 --> 00:46:16,992
Hi, cat.

580
00:46:18,324 --> 00:46:20,650
Did you get locked out of your house?

581
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,864
So, what happened? Did
everyone forget about you?

582
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,662
Would you like some company?

583
00:46:30,514 --> 00:46:32,824
You're not very nice, are you, cat?

584
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:34,518
Neither am I.

585
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,225
I used to be nice and friendly
and a grade-A student.

586
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:42,427
Now I just goof around reading
books and writing stupid lyrics.

587
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:43,874
I don't know what's wrong.

588
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,751
Even reading books isn't as
much fun as it used to be.

589
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:49,000
Now when I read a little
voice inside me says,

590
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,114
"Things never turn out like
they do in fairy tales."

591
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,987
I miss the old me.

592
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:21,261
Shizuku Tsukishima.

593
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:22,652
Hi.

594
00:47:22,658 --> 00:47:25,065
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.

595
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:27,279
You don't like anyone, do you, Moon?

596
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:28,945
So Moon is his name?

597
00:47:28,951 --> 00:47:32,866
He looks like a full moon, doesn't he?
Especially from that angle.

598
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:35,446
But I've heard him called
a few other names too.

599
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,996
What do you mean? Doesn't he belong to you?

600
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:42,126
Nope. He doesn't belong to anybody.

601
00:47:42,132 --> 00:47:45,453
He just wanders around our neighborhood
and lives in different houses.

602
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:47,536
I've heard our neighbors call him Muta.

603
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:50,948
Hmm. So he's a vagabond.

604
00:47:52,096 --> 00:47:55,728
That's right! I saw him riding
around on the train the other day.

605
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:57,770
- The train?
- Yeah.

606
00:47:57,776 --> 00:47:59,685
He was taking a trip all by himself,

607
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:01,978
he got off at my stop and
I followed him here.

608
00:48:01,984 --> 00:48:04,492
I was so excited when he
led me to this store.

609
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:07,416
It was like something
straight out of a fairy tale.

610
00:48:09,494 --> 00:48:12,613
I guess I shouldn't have said
those bad things about him.

611
00:48:12,747 --> 00:48:14,325
I said he was mean like me.

612
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:17,808
What? Moon's not like you.
He's not like you at all.

613
00:48:18,587 --> 00:48:21,921
I... I mean, the cat's
really kind of crazy.

614
00:48:29,223 --> 00:48:30,801
- So, I...
- Is your?

615
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:34,310
Is your grandfather OK?

616
00:48:34,437 --> 00:48:37,172
His shop has been closed for so long.
I hope he's not sick.

617
00:48:37,178 --> 00:48:39,592
Yeah, he's fine. He just
likes to keep weird hours.

618
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:41,776
His store is closed more
often than it's open.

619
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:46,079
I peeked in the window and saw the Baron
is not sitting on the table anymore.

620
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,290
- Did somebody buy him?
- You mean that cat statue?

621
00:48:49,456 --> 00:48:51,429
Wanna see him? Come on.

622
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:03,228
Can you close the door?

623
00:49:19,192 --> 00:49:20,603
This way.

624
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:25,699
Wow. It's almost like we're in the sky.

625
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:34,566
You're not afraid of
heights, are you, Shizuku?

626
00:49:35,669 --> 00:49:38,830
No. I love it up here. It's inspiring.

627
00:49:44,637 --> 00:49:48,385
From the balcony this time of
day is the prettiest. Come on.

628
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:13,066
Here we are.

629
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:16,459
- You can sit if you like.
- Hey, the clock is gone.

630
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,965
Oh, the big grandfather clock.
We delivered it today.

631
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:22,430
Here, have a look.

632
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:24,053
So who bought the clock?

633
00:50:24,178 --> 00:50:26,752
No one. It was just here for a repair job.

634
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:29,679
I see. Too bad. It was beautiful.

635
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:31,760
It took Grandpa three years to fix it.

636
00:50:31,853 --> 00:50:33,858
He finished it the day you
left your lunch here.

637
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,144
Hey, about that lunch...

638
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,821
I know it wasn't yours and
you don't eat like a pig.

639
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:40,835
Come over here and have a
look into the Baron's eyes.

640
00:50:43,163 --> 00:50:45,121
Hurry up. The sun's starting to set.

641
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:52,112
Wow.

642
00:50:57,422 --> 00:51:00,292
Pretty cool, huh? It's
actually an accident.

643
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,580
Sometimes the eyes get flawed
when they're installed,

644
00:51:02,586 --> 00:51:05,707
- then they refract the light like that.
- That's amazing.

645
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:09,498
Grandpa will never sell the Baron.
He wants to find its partner.

646
00:51:09,846 --> 00:51:11,672
There's another one?

647
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:16,399
Yeah. He says that her name is
Louise, but that's about it.

648
00:51:16,525 --> 00:51:19,977
Look as long as you like.
I'm going downstairs.

649
00:51:23,257 --> 00:51:25,665
The light switch is over
there if you need it.

650
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,717
So, Baron, let's hear about this Louise.

651
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:44,128
Is she an old girlfriend
of yours or something?

652
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,672
You look like you're all
dressed up for a wedding.

653
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:49,929
Did she leave you at the altar?
Did someone kidnap her?

654
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:54,487
There's a sad story there. I'll
have to figure it out for myself.

655
00:52:56,755 --> 00:52:58,257
Hey. Had enough?

656
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,044
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

657
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:03,463
So, is that a real violin you're making?

658
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:05,734
Oh. Yeah.

659
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:08,874
- Can I see?
- Sure.

660
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,232
It's nearly finished.

661
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:15,522
Wow!

662
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:18,481
You carved the entire
thing yourself, by hand?

663
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:21,692
- How else would you do it?
- That is amazing.

664
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:25,241
They've been making violins the
exact same way for 300 years,

665
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:26,706
but whether or not they sound any good

666
00:53:26,712 --> 00:53:28,767
is totally dependent on
the craftsman's skill.

667
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:31,908
Did you make all those violins?

668
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:33,705
No, of course not.

669
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,953
We hold violin-making classes here.

670
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,458
But one of them's yours, isn't it?

671
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:41,506
- Yeah.
- So which one is it?

672
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,297
- The end.
- Wow.

673
00:53:44,303 --> 00:53:46,015
That's really fantastic.

674
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,533
I can't believe you can
make something like this.

675
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:50,034
It's like magic, isn't it?

676
00:53:50,398 --> 00:53:52,022
You're so weird.

677
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,793
I can't believe some of the stuff
that comes out of your mouth.

678
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:58,144
It is magic. You made a violin
pop out of a piece of wood.

679
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,523
Anyone can make a violin of that caliber.

680
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:04,200
I'm not close to being good enough.

681
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,161
So, can you play the violin?

682
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:14,334
Sort of.

683
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,937
Would you play something
for me, just a little bit?

684
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:18,033
Give me a break.

685
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,532
Come on, come on. Won't you, please?

686
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:23,356
All right, but you're
gonna have to sing along.

687
00:54:23,368 --> 00:54:24,910
What?

688
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:27,539
You don't want me to sing. I'm terrible.

689
00:54:27,545 --> 00:54:29,703
I've got just the song for you.

690
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,007
Are you ready? I'm pretty
sure you know this one.

00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:44,911
I'm Shizuku, by the way. Thanks
for the great accompaniment.

729
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:48,961
You're welcome, Shizuku.

730
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,339
I was hoping we would meet up again.

731
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:54,338
These are my good friends, Kita and Minami.

732
00:57:54,344 --> 00:57:56,302
Nice vocals.

733
00:57:56,308 --> 00:58:00,140
You're the lucky girl who got to see
the grandfather clock strike 12:00.

734
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:03,675
I never knew you had such
a pretty friend, Seiji.

735
00:58:03,803 --> 00:58:06,092
What? Seiji?

736
00:58:06,098 --> 00:58:08,433
Is your name Seiji Amasawa?

737
00:58:08,558 --> 00:58:10,361
Yeah. Of course.

738
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:13,284
- Wait, didn't I tell you my name?
- No, you didn't.

739
00:58:13,564 --> 00:58:16,434
I thought it was Nishi.
That's what's on the sign.

740
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:19,734
That's my grandfather's last name.
Mine is Amasawa.

741
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:23,385
This is my worst nightmare.
I should have known better.

742
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:27,114
- I never get the fairy tale ending.
- What are you babbling about?

743
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,999
What difference does it
make what my name is?

744
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,664
It makes a difference! You knew my
name but you never told me yours.

745
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,747
You could've asked me my name.

746
00:58:34,753 --> 00:58:37,311
I never had a chance! This is so unfair!

747
00:58:37,992 --> 00:58:41,546
- I was so sure Seiji Amasawa was...
- I was what?

748
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:43,953
A nice, intelligent, civilized person.

749
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:46,175
Oh, really? You read too many fairy tales.

750
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:48,851
Clearly you've read a lot of them yourself.

751
00:59:04,242 --> 00:59:07,635
Your grandpa and his friends are
really nice. I had a great time.

752
00:59:07,641 --> 00:59:10,435
You'll have to come back. Grandpa
and his friends would like that.

753
00:59:10,441 --> 00:59:13,692
Next time I'm keeping my mouth shut.
No yelling or singing.

754
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,780
I could listen to you
play violin for hours.

755
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:21,080
- Have you ever thought of performing?
- My violin playing's nothing special.

756
00:59:21,086 --> 00:59:24,191
My ultimate goal is to be a
world-class violin maker.

757
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:27,218
That's great. You're already so good at it.

758
00:59:27,473 --> 00:59:29,347
No, if you really want to be good

759
00:59:29,353 --> 00:59:31,760
you have to be trained in Cremona, Italy.

760
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:34,815
I want to go there when I
graduate from junior high.

761
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,726
You're not going to high school?

762
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,402
My parents think I am,

763
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:40,816
but my grandpa is trying to
convince them otherwise.

764
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:43,443
I guess we'll have to see.
Cross your fingers.

765
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:58,780
That's great that you know what
you want to do with your life.

766
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:01,414
I don't have a clue what
I want to do with mine.

767
01:00:01,589 --> 01:00:03,582
I just waste time writing corny lyrics.

768
01:00:03,806 --> 01:00:07,098
I know what I want to do, but I
don't know if I'll get to do it.

769
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,430
I fight with my parents about it everyday.

770
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:12,799
Even if I get to go, it doesn't
mean that I'll be any good at it.

771
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:15,048
I'll just have to do my best and find out.

772
01:00:17,759 --> 01:00:19,275
You sure you don't want a ride home?

773
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:21,190
Yeah. It's just around the corner.

774
01:00:21,532 --> 01:00:22,808
See ya.

775
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:25,137
Uh, Shizuku...

776
01:00:26,408 --> 01:00:27,408
Yeah?

777
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:29,864
I just wanted to say that I
actually liked your lyrics.

778
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:34,266
You're a very talented writer. Keep
pursuing it. It's not a waste of time.

779
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,359
Just the other day you told
me my lyrics were corny.

780
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:40,342
- Oh, did I really say that?
- Seiji!

781
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:42,247
I'm sorry.

782
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:46,161
Ha! You're forgetful too. See you later.

783
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:09,496
Shizuku, turn off your lamp. You
left it on all night last night.

784
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:19,586
When did you know what
to do with your life?

785
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,341
- What are you talking about?
- You know!

786
01:01:22,347 --> 01:01:24,886
Don't worry about it.
You'll take your exams

787
01:01:24,892 --> 01:01:27,753
and whatever high school you get
into will pretty much decide things.

788
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:30,879
- Don't we get a choice?
- You do if you study hard.

789
01:01:32,024 --> 01:01:33,602
Now go to sleep.

790
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:35,270
Good night.

791
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:52,763
I can't believe Mom didn't wake me up.
She's getting more forgetful than I am.

792
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:04,858
- Uh, hello?
- Oh, hello.

793
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:07,345
Can't you run any faster?

794
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:09,637
You don't have to wait for me.

795
01:02:27,148 --> 01:02:28,585
Just made it.

796
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,868
Shizuku, what happened?

797
01:02:30,962 --> 01:02:32,504
Ah, you look like a wreck.

798
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:35,300
Well, you seem fine. You
sure do recover fast.

799
01:02:35,425 --> 01:02:38,860
Is it true that you were out with a
boy from another class last night?

800
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:41,276
- Where did you hear that?
- It's a rumor.

801
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:43,221
They say it looked like the
two of you are going steady.

802
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:47,160
- It's nothing like that, Yuko.
- I'm not worried about it.

803
01:02:51,363 --> 01:02:52,988
It's what the book says.

804
01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:54,939
Yuko, about my friend's letter,

805
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:57,356
I'll tell my friend you're
not interested. I'm sorry.

806
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:00,135
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

807
01:03:00,327 --> 01:03:02,069
It's OK.

808
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,446
Hey, did you see Sasuke last night? I
was blown away. It was the best ever!

809
01:03:17,284 --> 01:03:20,036
This formula's gonna be on
tomorrow's test, class,

810
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,511
so make sure you know it.

811
01:03:23,304 --> 01:03:24,846
Class dismissed.

812
01:03:26,587 --> 01:03:28,431
You forgot your books.

813
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:32,928
I'm a little nervous to ask her out.
I mean, should I?

814
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:34,888
I didn't even get to see it.

815
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,388
No way!

816
01:03:45,412 --> 01:03:47,451
Excuse me, is this Shizuku's classroom?

817
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:49,842
Hey, Amasawa, what's up?

818
01:03:50,052 --> 01:03:52,425
I'm looking for Shizuku. Is she in here?

819
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:55,886
Shizuku? Yeah, she's here.

820
01:03:55,892 --> 01:03:59,511
Hey Shizuku, you got a visitor. It's a guy!

821
01:04:03,818 --> 01:04:06,855
Seiji, she's right over there.

822
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,777
Hi, Seiji.

823
01:04:09,914 --> 01:04:12,321
Shizuku, can we talk for a minute?

824
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,489
Uh, sure.

825
01:04:14,495 --> 01:04:16,904
Check it out! Shizuku's got a boyfriend!

826
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,542
♪ <i>Shizuku's got a boyfriend</i> ♪

827
01:04:20,627 --> 01:04:23,664
No, I don't. Hey, he's not my boyfriend!

828
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:26,371
Aww, come on.

829
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:28,127
Boyfri...

830
01:04:30,387 --> 01:04:32,047
All right, what is it?

831
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:34,933
I get to go to Cremona, Italy.
I just found out.

832
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:37,307
What? Come on, let's go.

833
01:04:42,023 --> 01:04:44,313
- Where are we going?
- To the roof.

834
01:04:51,827 --> 01:04:53,867
Oh, excellent.

835
01:04:53,996 --> 01:04:58,705
Seiji, why did you broadcast to the
class that you wanted to talk to me?

836
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:02,652
I'm sorry. I was excited and I
wanted you to be the first to know.

837
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:08,167
But now people might get
the idea that you like me.

838
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:10,094
Don't worry about it.

839
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:12,882
Hey, so even though my parents
gave in there's a catch.

840
01:05:12,888 --> 01:05:14,728
Oh. What's the catch?

841
01:05:14,734 --> 01:05:16,344
Well, when I'm in Italy

842
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:19,777
I have to try out with this friend of
my grandpa's who owns the workshop.

843
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,489
Try out?

844
01:05:21,495 --> 01:05:24,178
Yeah, my parents said I get
two months to prove myself.

845
01:05:24,184 --> 01:05:26,495
If my grandpa's friend doesn't
think I have potential,

846
01:05:26,642 --> 01:05:28,919
then I have to come back
here and go to high school.

847
01:05:30,751 --> 01:05:33,694
I've heard this guy is really
tough on his apprentices,

848
01:05:33,921 --> 01:05:37,670
so it doesn't seem fair that my
parents are only giving me one shot.

849
01:05:37,676 --> 01:05:39,569
But it's a great opportunity, so I'm going.

850
01:05:39,575 --> 01:05:43,217
- When? Do you leave soon?
- As soon as I get my passport.

851
01:05:43,248 --> 01:05:46,101
My dad said he was going to
notify the school today.

852
01:05:46,267 --> 01:05:48,426
Wow, that fast, huh?

853
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:52,054
I'm happy for you. Your
dream's coming true.

854
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,931
I hope so. I'm going to give
it everything I've got.

855
01:05:57,363 --> 01:05:58,738
- Would you?
- Oh...

856
01:06:00,868 --> 01:06:02,824
Hey, it stopped raining. Look.

857
01:06:02,961 --> 01:06:04,041
Yeah, you're right.

858
01:06:04,787 --> 01:06:06,946
Wow! Look at that view.

859
01:06:12,128 --> 01:06:14,085
Maybe we'll see a rainbow.

860
01:06:14,214 --> 01:06:15,245
Yeah.

861
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:28,237
I wonder what Cremona, Italy will be like.

862
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:30,223
I hope it turns out to be a nice place.

863
01:06:30,522 --> 01:06:32,847
Mm-hmm. The city's really old,

864
01:06:32,853 --> 01:06:35,807
and everybody there thinks
violin making is respectable.

865
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,649
That's great.

866
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:40,572
It's so brave of you to go
after your dream like that.

867
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:42,488
I just waste my time reading books,

868
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,898
and all I've been dreaming about was
we would go to the same high school.

869
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,453
OK, that was embarrassing. I
shouldn't have said that.

870
01:06:53,378 --> 01:06:55,251
Shh! Stay down.

871
01:06:55,257 --> 01:06:57,713
- Do you think they'll kiss?
- Hurry up.

872
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:10,315
You know, I noticed you a long time ago.

873
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:12,609
I first spotted you reading in the library.

874
01:07:12,865 --> 01:07:16,366
I walked past you hundreds of times,
but you never noticed me, right?

875
01:07:17,226 --> 01:07:20,227
I even sat down in the chair right
next to you a couple times.

876
01:07:20,233 --> 01:07:21,395
Yeah?

877
01:07:21,535 --> 01:07:23,649
Then I started checking
out all sorts of books

878
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:26,111
just so I can get my name
on the cards before you.

879
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:27,989
Guess that got your attention.

880
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:29,835
But now...

881
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:32,750
I have to take off to Italy.

882
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:35,711
That's some pretty lousy
timing, don't you think?

883
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,223
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

884
01:07:42,235 --> 01:07:44,643
Hey, quit pushin'! I can't see!

885
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:53,322
You jerks!

886
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,034
Get out of the way! Shizuku is really mad!

887
01:08:07,348 --> 01:08:08,525
Hey!

888
01:08:34,655 --> 01:08:36,445
- Here, Dad.
- Thank you.

889
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:39,571
- I'm going to Yuko's.
- Shizuku, is that all you're having?

890
01:08:40,668 --> 01:08:42,328
I'm not hungry.

891
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:47,577
Pick up some milk on your way home, OK?

892
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:49,540
I don't feel like it.

893
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:52,553
Hey, you're the one who drank it all.

894
01:08:52,654 --> 01:08:55,405
She's really been slacking
off these last few days.

895
01:09:03,628 --> 01:09:05,253
Taxi!

896
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:09,015
Sorry, I can't go.

897
01:09:15,346 --> 01:09:18,347
- Thanks for meeting me, Yuko.
- No problem.

898
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,394
I've never been so confused in my life.

899
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,942
Mom, Shizuku's here.

900
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:24,644
- Shizuku, how nice to see you.
- Hi, Mrs. Harada.

901
01:09:26,808 --> 01:09:28,535
Hello, girls.

902
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:31,126
- Hi, Mr. Harada.
- Hi, Shizuku.

903
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:33,753
Would you two like some tea and cookies?

904
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:35,384
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

905
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:38,635
I'm having a fight with my father.
I'm not talking to him.

906
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:47,731
Boys really have guts, don't they?

907
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:50,019
He'll be gone for two months.

908
01:09:50,025 --> 01:09:52,253
He's returning for our graduation ceremony,

909
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:55,049
then he's going back again to
study for about ten years.

910
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:57,214
You'll practically never see him again.

911
01:09:57,957 --> 01:09:59,072
But you're so lucky.

912
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:02,021
The two of you sound like the
perfect match, like soul mates.

913
01:10:02,027 --> 01:10:04,870
He's so much better than me.
We read the same books

914
01:10:04,876 --> 01:10:07,034
but I never do anything with what I learn.

915
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,080
He decided long ago what he wanted to do.

916
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:12,221
- He's going straight for his dream.
- I guess so.

917
01:10:13,598 --> 01:10:17,050
You know what? Kinuyo was in the
same first year class as Seiji.

918
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:20,089
She said he was a little hard
to approach but a good student

919
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:21,930
and really handsome too.

920
01:10:21,983 --> 01:10:23,727
You don't need to rub it in.

921
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,940
I already feel like I'm not good enough.

922
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:27,694
This whole thing is doomed.

923
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:30,442
No, it's not. All that
matters is he likes you.

924
01:10:30,448 --> 01:10:32,655
- Didn't he say that?
- Yeah.

925
01:10:32,785 --> 01:10:34,943
But I'm not sure I believe it.

926
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:38,201
I don't get you.

927
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:40,414
It's so cool. You could be writing letters

928
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:43,291
and encouraging each
other every single day.

929
01:10:43,627 --> 01:10:45,584
How could I ever encourage him?

930
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,962
He's worked so much
harder than I ever have.

931
01:10:48,092 --> 01:10:49,635
You are weird.

932
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:52,345
Just because you haven't decided

933
01:10:52,351 --> 01:10:55,119
what you're going to do after you
graduate from junior high school

934
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,794
doesn't mean that you're
not good enough for him.

935
01:10:59,778 --> 01:11:02,185
Everyone in school thinks you're talented.

936
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:05,857
You've read more books than anyone
I know and your lyrics are great.

937
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:09,612
And you can tell people just what you feel.
I can't do that.

938
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:14,031
I'm not close to being good enough.

939
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:15,495
- Yes, you are.
- Mm-mmm.

940
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,908
That's what Seiji said.

941
01:11:16,914 --> 01:11:19,156
He isn't sure he has any talent either.

942
01:11:19,418 --> 01:11:21,541
I should test myself like he is.

943
01:11:23,255 --> 01:11:26,340
That's what I'll do.
I'll try being a writer.

944
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:27,801
I've already got a story.

945
01:11:27,807 --> 01:11:29,965
I've got two months to see what I can do.

946
01:11:30,847 --> 01:11:32,589
But midterms are coming up.

947
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:34,965
That's OK. Thanks, Yuko.

948
01:11:35,231 --> 01:11:37,389
I feel like maybe I can handle this now.

949
01:11:37,395 --> 01:11:40,016
- You're going?
- Yeah. I've gotta get writing.

950
01:11:41,608 --> 01:11:43,684
Bye, Mr. And Mrs. Harada.

951
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:46,003
- Bye, Sumo.
- Say hello to your mom for me.

952
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:47,338
I will.

953
01:11:49,949 --> 01:11:53,034
- You hang in there too, Yuko.
- Mm-hmm.

954
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,161
I'm sure Sugimura will see
what a good person you are.

955
01:11:57,789 --> 01:11:59,034
See you later.

956
01:12:00,842 --> 01:12:02,833
So that's it. It's simple.

957
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:05,275
All I have to do is give my writing a try.

958
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,831
Moon.

959
01:12:13,308 --> 01:12:16,298
Muta! Muta!

960
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:19,687
Hey, Mom, Muta ran off again.

961
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:21,852
Where does he keep going?

962
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:23,602
Muta. Huh.

963
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:31,485
<i>Whisper of the Heart</i> by Shizuku Tsukishima.

964
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,659
"Listen to the voice of the forest

965
01:12:33,923 --> 01:12:37,537
and the wind that blows from
a far-off cluster of stars."

966
01:12:56,184 --> 01:12:59,478
So, you want to write a
story about the Baron?

967
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:01,640
Something about him inspires me,

968
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:04,231
but I know the Baron has
special meaning for you,

969
01:13:04,237 --> 01:13:07,117
so I thought I'd better ask your
permission before I use him in my book.

970
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,364
You can use the Baron.

971
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:12,615
Thank you for asking,

972
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,371
but I'd like to ask for a favor in return.

973
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,417
Yes?

974
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:22,574
Once you have finished your story I
want to be the first to read it, hmm?

975
01:13:22,685 --> 01:13:24,879
Oh, uh... I...

976
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:26,379
Is it a deal?

977
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:28,478
Do I really have to show it to you?

978
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:31,822
I've never written anything before.
I'm afraid it's gonna stink.

979
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,265
You sound just like all the
other artists that I've met.

980
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:40,771
No one should expect perfection
when they're first starting out.

981
01:13:40,777 --> 01:13:43,481
Wait a minute. I've got
something to show you.

982
01:13:49,702 --> 01:13:52,027
I think you'll like this.

983
01:13:55,716 --> 01:13:57,330
Take a look.

984
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,912
It looks like a rock.

985
01:14:05,027 --> 01:14:08,134
It's a special kind of rock called a geode.

986
01:14:08,222 --> 01:14:10,510
Hold it close to your eye and look inside.

987
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:12,343
That's right, like that.

988
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,646
Wow.

989
01:14:23,786 --> 01:14:25,191
Look at that.

990
01:14:25,197 --> 01:14:27,140
Those crystals are called beryl.

991
01:14:27,146 --> 01:14:30,312
There are pieces of raw
emeralds deep inside them.

992
01:14:30,578 --> 01:14:33,750
- Aren't emeralds worth a lot of money?
- Sure.

993
01:14:34,528 --> 01:14:37,247
But they need to be cut and polished first.

994
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:40,503
When you first become an
artist you are like that rock.

995
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:44,300
You're in a raw natural state
with hidden gems inside.

996
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:48,971
You have to dig down deep and find
the emeralds tucked away inside you.

997
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:51,476
And that's just the beginning.

998
01:14:51,482 --> 01:14:54,317
Once you've found your gems
you have to polish them.

999
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:56,971
It takes a lot of hard work.

1000
01:14:56,977 --> 01:15:01,105
Look at the crack in the geode.

1001
01:15:01,489 --> 01:15:02,760
OK.

1002
01:15:02,766 --> 01:15:05,026
You see that big green crystal there?

1003
01:15:05,032 --> 01:15:07,362
You could spend years polishing that

1004
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:09,859
and it wouldn't be worth much at all.

1005
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:12,356
The smaller crystals are
much more valuable,

1006
01:15:12,362 --> 01:15:15,706
and there may be some even
deeper inside that we can't see

1007
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,372
which are even more precious.

1008
01:15:17,604 --> 01:15:20,960
Oh, it's bad to get old.
You just keep rambling.

1009
01:15:20,966 --> 01:15:22,425
I'll shut up now.

1010
01:15:23,844 --> 01:15:26,631
What if I look inside myself
and I don't find any gems?

1011
01:15:26,637 --> 01:15:28,344
What if I'm just a rock?

1012
01:15:28,684 --> 01:15:30,178
I'm going to try anyway.

1013
01:15:30,184 --> 01:15:32,664
I'll write that story and I'll
let you be the first to read it.

1014
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:36,343
That's the spirit. I'll
be looking forward to it.

1015
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:48,403
A raw gem in a vein of lapis lazuli.

1016
01:15:52,124 --> 01:15:54,631
Ah, let us go forth together,

1017
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:57,804
in search of the vein of lapis lazuli.

1018
01:15:59,548 --> 01:16:01,294
Look. Be not fearful.

1019
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,669
On the day of the new moon space is warped.

1020
01:16:07,223 --> 01:16:10,674
As such, things far away loom large

1021
01:16:10,887 --> 01:16:13,895
whereas things near at hand appear small.

1022
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,724
Come, let us fly.

1023
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:18,271
We will rise on the updraft!

1024
01:16:22,944 --> 01:16:24,569
But we must hurry!

1025
01:16:24,575 --> 01:16:26,900
Quick! The planetoids are gathering.

1026
01:16:28,663 --> 01:16:29,943
Shall we?

1027
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:33,980
And... off we go!

1028
01:16:38,882 --> 01:16:41,759
That's it! We're riding the air currents.

1029
01:16:42,046 --> 01:16:44,879
See that tower? We'll clear
it in a single leap.

1030
01:16:45,088 --> 01:16:47,130
Are you kidding? That's so high.

1031
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:49,294
Ah, it just looks high.

1032
01:16:49,559 --> 01:16:52,477
You'll see once we get closer.

1033
01:17:08,743 --> 01:17:11,744
Let's go. When the afternoon
air currents mix,

1034
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,790
we can even touch the stars without fear.

1035
01:17:15,545 --> 01:17:17,021
That's strange.

1036
01:17:20,426 --> 01:17:22,667
Shizuku's in nonfiction?

1037
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:25,846
I've never seen her look at
anything but fairy tales.

1038
01:18:04,737 --> 01:18:08,423
It's a prisoner locked in a
cell and he's making a violin.

1039
01:18:40,886 --> 01:18:43,045
Seiji!

1040
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,256
I thought you had left for Italy.

1041
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:48,727
I just talked to my grandpa.
He said you might be here.

1042
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:52,393
I'm glad I found you. I'm leaving tomorrow.

1043
01:18:52,864 --> 01:18:54,822
You are?

1044
01:18:55,978 --> 01:18:58,858
Go on. You should keep working.

1045
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,691
I'll wait until you're done.

1046
01:19:26,643 --> 01:19:28,600
Sorry I can't see you home.

1047
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:32,095
I'm just glad I was able to see you again.

1048
01:19:32,459 --> 01:19:34,229
I can't go to the airport with you

1049
01:19:34,235 --> 01:19:36,431
but I'll be waiting for
you when you come back.

1050
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,272
I'll see you in two months then.

1051
01:19:44,996 --> 01:19:48,615
I'm sorry for complaining
all the time, Seiji.

1052
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:51,282
I promise I'll work hard while you're gone.

1053
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,003
Well, I better go.

1054
01:20:03,057 --> 01:20:04,516
Have a safe trip.

1055
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:25,580
Louise, my betrothed and I,

1056
01:20:25,664 --> 01:20:28,665
were born in a far-off land.

1057
01:20:32,964 --> 01:20:37,008
<i>Back then, magic was
still alive in our town,</i>

1058
01:20:37,135 --> 01:20:39,590
<i>and the streets were lined with shops</i>

1059
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:43,671
<i>where the descendents of
magicians worked as artisans.</i>

1060
01:20:47,437 --> 01:20:52,266
<i>The craftsman who made us was
a poor apprentice doll-maker.</i>

1061
01:20:55,612 --> 01:20:58,448
<i>But Louise and I were happy,</i>

1062
01:20:58,532 --> 01:21:00,490
<i>for the man who made us</i>

1063
01:21:00,576 --> 01:21:03,447
<i>gave us the ability to love.</i>

1064
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:07,033
<i>Then one day...</i>

1065
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:14,338
Shizuku.

1066
01:21:14,466 --> 01:21:16,126
Shizuku!

1067
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,799
Shizuku!

1068
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,171
The answer, Shizuku?

1069
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:23,837
Stand up.

1070
01:21:24,685 --> 01:21:27,306
I don't know, sir. I
wasn't paying attention.

1071
01:21:27,312 --> 01:21:29,613
You haven't been paying attention all week.

1072
01:21:29,893 --> 01:21:33,142
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Yuko, will you help out Shizuku?

1073
01:21:33,148 --> 01:21:34,624
Yes, sir.

1074
01:21:35,653 --> 01:21:38,819
What? You were up until
four in the morning?

1075
01:21:38,825 --> 01:21:41,651
I just can't seem to stop
writing for some reason.

1076
01:21:42,538 --> 01:21:46,452
You keep spacing out all
the time, like today.

1077
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:48,418
I was thinking about my story.

1078
01:21:48,419 --> 01:21:51,456
There's so much I want to write.
I can't find enough time.

1079
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:55,062
I don't feel like eating.

1080
01:22:23,789 --> 01:22:26,364
Oh! Shizuku, it's you.

1081
01:22:26,628 --> 01:22:28,372
You scared me half to death.

1082
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:30,205
Why didn't you have the lights on?

1083
01:22:30,297 --> 01:22:32,622
Oh, Shizuku, you didn't finish the laundry.

1084
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:35,166
Get in here, Shizuku! Shizuku!

1085
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:41,983
Where's Shizuku? Doesn't she want dinner?

1086
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:44,266
She said she isn't hungry.

1087
01:23:04,837 --> 01:23:06,329
Can you believe that?

1088
01:23:06,335 --> 01:23:08,005
She actually said that.

1089
01:23:09,004 --> 01:23:10,664
Oh, hello, Mrs. Tsukishima.

1090
01:23:10,798 --> 01:23:13,336
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No trouble at all.

1091
01:23:13,342 --> 01:23:15,764
Do you know if the career
counseling room is open?

1092
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:18,221
- Yeah.
- Come this way.

1093
01:23:24,611 --> 01:23:25,856
I'm home.

1094
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,198
Hi there, Mom.

1095
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,316
You're home early today.

1096
01:23:34,329 --> 01:23:36,572
Ohh, I'm exhausted.

1097
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:39,549
- Want some coffee?
- Sounds great.

1098
01:23:42,081 --> 01:23:45,201
So, Mom, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

1099
01:23:45,293 --> 01:23:48,709
Not something bad, I hope.
I already have a headache.

1100
01:23:51,758 --> 01:23:54,166
I'm thinking of moving into my own place.

1101
01:23:54,302 --> 01:23:56,285
I found the greatest apartment.

1102
01:23:56,429 --> 01:23:58,801
Honey, can you really afford to move out?

1103
01:23:59,053 --> 01:24:01,366
I saved some money from my temp job,

1104
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:05,174
and I just got a part-time position
in a test-preparation school.

1105
01:24:05,606 --> 01:24:10,026
I see. I've gotten so used to you
helping me out while I'm in school.

1106
01:24:10,027 --> 01:24:13,003
But we'll be fine. I'll talk
to your father about it.

1107
01:24:13,023 --> 01:24:15,495
Really? Thanks, Mom.

1108
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,691
Financially I think you'll
have to manage on your own

1109
01:24:19,697 --> 01:24:21,711
until I finish my last semester of school.

1110
01:24:21,717 --> 01:24:25,567
- Once I graduate I can help you out.
- That'd be great.

1111
01:24:25,711 --> 01:24:28,859
I hate to do this now while you're in
the middle of your master's thesis.

1112
01:24:28,865 --> 01:24:30,602
No, don't worry about it.

1113
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:34,191
I really appreciate all the help
you gave me preparing the data.

1114
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:36,609
It'll be good for Shizuku
to have her own room

1115
01:24:36,615 --> 01:24:40,112
so she can focus on her studies.
She's been acting so strange lately.

1116
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:41,766
You're telling me.

1117
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:45,907
I had a conference today with one
of her teachers. Look at this.

1118
01:24:46,274 --> 01:24:48,313
Huh. What is it?

1119
01:24:48,572 --> 01:24:50,648
What's happened to her?

1120
01:24:50,654 --> 01:24:52,611
I've never seen grades this low.

1121
01:24:53,574 --> 01:24:56,065
It's so strange. I wonder what she's doing.

1122
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:57,862
She's at her desk all day.

1123
01:25:05,753 --> 01:25:08,292
- Oh, good evening.
- Good evening.

1124
01:25:10,633 --> 01:25:12,176
Thank you.

1125
01:25:17,481 --> 01:25:20,693
With grades like that, no
high school will accept you.

1126
01:25:21,019 --> 01:25:23,541
Fine. I'm not going to high school anyway.

1127
01:25:24,045 --> 01:25:27,687
Are you crazy? You think a
junior high education is enough?

1128
01:25:27,693 --> 01:25:29,736
What kind of fantasy
world are you living in?

1129
01:25:29,742 --> 01:25:32,445
Hey, it's my future so I make the decision.

1130
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:35,923
Don't give me that attitude. You know
you're being completely ridiculous.

1131
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:38,535
If you keep acting like
this you'll ruin your life.

1132
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:40,934
School's really made your life great.

1133
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:43,662
All you've done since college
is work part-time jobs.

1134
01:25:43,668 --> 01:25:46,661
I'm making money and I can support myself.

1135
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:48,992
What job will you get
without a college degree?

1136
01:25:48,998 --> 01:25:52,746
You'll end up destitute because you're
in some stupid rebellious phase.

1137
01:25:52,752 --> 01:25:55,326
I'm not being rebellious.
I'm going after my dreams.

1138
01:25:55,332 --> 01:25:58,725
What dreams? You just goof
around reading books.

1139
01:25:59,769 --> 01:26:02,732
Stop the arguing, girls. I've heard enough.

1140
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:06,191
But Dad, she's gonna ruin her
life if she keeps this up.

1141
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:09,727
Hmm. All right. Let's go to
the kitchen and discuss this.

1142
01:26:09,821 --> 01:26:12,858
Shizuku, change out of your
uniform first, please.

1143
01:26:15,034 --> 01:26:16,695
Hurry it up.

1144
01:26:30,093 --> 01:26:31,670
A bit low.

1145
01:26:31,803 --> 01:26:34,258
Shizuku, are you doing the best you can?

1146
01:26:34,347 --> 01:26:36,387
Yes! I take these tests very seriously.

1147
01:26:36,517 --> 01:26:39,261
Just a little bit ago you said you
weren't going to high school.

1148
01:26:39,267 --> 01:26:41,876
You were the one who said no
high school would accept me.

1149
01:26:41,882 --> 01:26:44,626
Shiho, I'd like to talk to Shizuku alone.

1150
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:46,755
Would you please excuse yourself, honey?

1151
01:26:46,761 --> 01:26:48,172
Fine.

1152
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:53,450
- Where's your mother?
- She's at the Tanakas.

1153
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:56,824
- I'm home.
- There she is. Hey, Mom.

1154
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:59,072
- Is your father home?
- He's in the kitchen.

1155
01:26:59,078 --> 01:27:02,446
Could you come in here? I'm
having a talk with Shizuku.

1156
01:27:02,452 --> 01:27:04,383
Sure. Just a second.

1157
01:27:10,379 --> 01:27:13,250
All right, Shizuku.

1158
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:15,927
You have something that you're doing

1159
01:27:15,933 --> 01:27:18,603
that you think is more
important than studying?

1160
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:23,018
Will you tell us what it is?

1161
01:27:24,025 --> 01:27:26,101
When I can tell you, I will.

1162
01:27:26,361 --> 01:27:30,525
Shizuku, can't you do whatever
it is once your exams are over?

1163
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:34,281
I have to do it now. I've only got
three weeks left before he...

1164
01:27:34,411 --> 01:27:38,015
It's that I promised myself
I'd achieve this certain goal

1165
01:27:38,366 --> 01:27:41,070
- or I'm not good enough.
- Good enough for what?

1166
01:27:41,335 --> 01:27:43,707
Why do you need to prove yourself?

1167
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,917
We can't help you unless you
tell us what's going on.

1168
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:52,406
What could you be doing that you can't
tell your mother and father about?

1169
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:57,288
- Honey, please.
- Oh, sorry. I'll put it out.

1170
01:28:06,112 --> 01:28:08,065
You work so hard in the library.

1171
01:28:08,071 --> 01:28:10,646
Whatever you're doing, I
know it's important to you.

1172
01:28:10,782 --> 01:28:12,825
And I truly respect that.

1173
01:28:13,702 --> 01:28:17,325
Honey, why don't we let Shizuku
do what she thinks is best?

1174
01:28:18,082 --> 01:28:20,538
Not everyone needs to follow the same path.

1175
01:28:20,669 --> 01:28:21,748
Hmm.

1176
01:28:22,227 --> 01:28:26,771
Well, I have to admit I've often dreamed
about straying from the path myself.

1177
01:28:28,134 --> 01:28:31,958
All right, Shizuku, go ahead and
do what your heart tells you.

1178
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,803
But it's never easy when you do things
differently from everyone else.

1179
01:28:37,231 --> 01:28:40,884
If things don't go well, you'll
only have yourself to blame.

1180
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:45,066
And I want you to eat meals with
us, no matter how busy you get.

1181
01:28:45,072 --> 01:28:47,479
That's right. We like to
see you once in a while.

1182
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:50,154
- OK.
- Tell your sister we're finished.

1183
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,321
I'll make us some tea.

1184
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,455
Hey, Shizuku.

1185
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,584
Dad let you have your own way,

1186
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:05,460
but he wants you to study and
get into a good high school.

1187
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:08,384
I know that. It was written
all over his face.

1188
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:12,337
By the way, I'm gonna be
moving out next Sunday.

1189
01:29:12,474 --> 01:29:14,382
You'll have the room to yourself.

1190
01:29:14,517 --> 01:29:16,806
You're moving out? I didn't know that.

1191
01:29:16,812 --> 01:29:19,385
Yep. You're gonna be on your own now.

1192
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,144
Hurry!

1193
01:29:31,812 --> 01:29:32,938
Faster!

1194
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:34,319
Faster!

1195
01:29:35,028 --> 01:29:37,581
Only one stone is genuine.

1196
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,825
Which one? Which one is real?

1197
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:41,788
You are on your own now.

1198
01:29:42,038 --> 01:29:44,590
You must make the choice yourself.

1199
01:29:45,133 --> 01:29:46,413
Hurry!

1200
01:31:23,302 --> 01:31:26,024
Louise, you've come back to me.

1201
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:30,277
I'm sorry I've grown old. I
didn't know you'd return.

1202
01:31:55,313 --> 01:31:58,749
Shizuku. Please, come on in.

1203
01:31:58,908 --> 01:32:01,617
I was just taking a nap.

1204
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,693
Did I wake you? I'm sorry.

1205
01:32:04,823 --> 01:32:07,989
I hate to bother you, Mr.
Nishi, but my story's finished.

1206
01:32:09,461 --> 01:32:12,076
Ooh, wonderful.

1207
01:32:12,165 --> 01:32:14,572
Oh, you should be very proud.

1208
01:32:15,624 --> 01:32:19,231
Well, here it is. You're the first
one to read it, just as promised.

1209
01:32:19,237 --> 01:32:21,697
Well, this is a good-sized novel.

1210
01:32:21,847 --> 01:32:24,965
<i>Whisper of the Heart</i> by Shizuku Tsukishima.

1211
01:32:25,053 --> 01:32:28,029
I know it's a bit long, but
could you read it right away?

1212
01:32:28,035 --> 01:32:30,074
I'll just wait here, if you don't mind.

1213
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,951
I could, but you've put so much into this.

1214
01:32:32,957 --> 01:32:35,365
Shouldn't I take my time
and read it carefully?

1215
01:32:35,563 --> 01:32:38,269
I'd rather you read it now,
'cause I'm kind of nervous.

1216
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:40,556
You don't have to read it
all, just a few pages.

1217
01:32:41,195 --> 01:32:44,456
And then... then if it's
boring you can quit.

1218
01:32:44,734 --> 01:32:47,403
I understand. I'll read it right away.

1219
01:32:47,409 --> 01:32:50,778
Have a seat by the fire. It's getting cold.

1220
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:59,044
There. Now no one will disturb us.

1221
01:33:02,641 --> 01:33:06,009
Uh, would it be OK with
you if I wait downstairs?

1222
01:33:06,015 --> 01:33:08,044
- Hmm?
- I won't get cold.

1223
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:09,544
I'd rather not watch you read.

1224
01:33:11,311 --> 01:33:14,928
Hmm. That'll be fine. Go ahead.

1225
01:34:27,725 --> 01:34:29,682
So, there you are.

1226
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:32,302
I finished your book, Shizuku.

1227
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:37,020
Thank you, dear. It was really wonderful.

1228
01:34:37,026 --> 01:34:38,730
No, it's not! It's a mess.

1229
01:34:38,736 --> 01:34:40,646
The storyline goes all over the place.

1230
01:34:40,652 --> 01:34:42,858
All the characters' dialogue sounds corny.

1231
01:34:43,074 --> 01:34:46,194
You have to tell me the truth. I
know it's a complete disaster.

1232
01:34:46,534 --> 01:34:50,347
No. It's just a bit rough,
dear, like Seiji's violin.

1233
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:52,659
What I read was raw and heartfelt.

1234
01:34:54,906 --> 01:34:57,455
You should be very proud
for all your hard work.

1235
01:34:57,461 --> 01:35:00,877
You've dug inside your soul
and found some real gems.

1236
01:35:01,219 --> 01:35:05,431
Next you'll need to polish it, which
will also take a lot of work.

1237
01:35:06,808 --> 01:35:10,936
There's no need to be upset.
Just have a little patience.

1238
01:35:35,894 --> 01:35:38,964
Now let's go inside. It's cold out here.

1239
01:35:39,051 --> 01:35:40,758
OK.

1240
01:35:40,844 --> 01:35:44,213
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be crying.

1241
01:35:44,348 --> 01:35:47,017
I wanted so badly to do a good job,

1242
01:35:47,142 --> 01:35:49,990
but there's so much that I
don't know about writing.

1243
01:35:50,938 --> 01:35:55,399
And Seiji, he's so much more
accomplished than I am.

1244
01:35:55,526 --> 01:35:57,725
I can never catch up.

1245
01:35:57,731 --> 01:35:59,938
I can never be good enough.

1246
01:36:02,246 --> 01:36:05,330
I see. You must be very fond of Seiji.

1247
01:36:25,766 --> 01:36:27,676
How do you like your noodles, hmm?

1248
01:36:28,999 --> 01:36:30,649
I like them a lot.

1249
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:34,692
When Seiji finished making
his very first violin,

1250
01:36:34,776 --> 01:36:37,314
he was far more upset than you are today.

1251
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:40,836
It took four batches of
noodles to calm him down.

1252
01:36:44,036 --> 01:36:46,194
Ah. Thank you, dear.

1253
01:36:47,445 --> 01:36:50,662
Now tell me, how far did we
get into the Baron's story?

1254
01:36:50,668 --> 01:36:54,144
You were a student in Germany when
you found the Baron in a café.

1255
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:56,383
Ah, that's right.

1256
01:36:57,508 --> 01:37:01,886
I was captivated by his expression.
It was so sad and mysterious.

1257
01:37:02,013 --> 01:37:05,347
So I begged the owner of the
café to let me buy the Baron.

1258
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:08,762
But he refused to sell it to me.

1259
01:37:08,768 --> 01:37:12,806
He said the Baron had a female
companion who was away for repairs.

1260
01:37:12,812 --> 01:37:14,971
The two of them made
such a beautiful couple

1261
01:37:14,977 --> 01:37:17,741
he didn't think it was
right to separate them.

1262
01:37:17,965 --> 01:37:22,793
I told him that as soon as the Baroness
was repaired, I'd buy them both.

1263
01:37:23,078 --> 01:37:26,612
The Baroness, her name was
Louise, isn't that right?

1264
01:37:26,706 --> 01:37:29,826
No one knows this, but Louise was the name

1265
01:37:30,205 --> 01:37:32,380
of a woman I went to school with.

1266
01:37:32,386 --> 01:37:34,379
She and I became very close,

1267
01:37:34,673 --> 01:37:38,962
and every day we'd meet at the café
to see if the Baroness had returned.

1268
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:42,922
Louise pleaded with the café
owner to sell me the Baron.

1269
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:45,892
She promised to buy the
Baroness and hold onto her

1270
01:37:45,977 --> 01:37:48,598
until the two statues could be reunited.

1271
01:37:49,082 --> 01:37:51,399
Finally the café owner agreed,

1272
01:37:51,524 --> 01:37:53,849
and I left for Japan with the Baron.

1273
01:37:53,985 --> 01:37:58,114
I promised Louise that I would return
to Germany as soon as possible,

1274
01:37:58,448 --> 01:38:02,778
and I vowed that when the Baron
and Baroness were reunited,

1275
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:04,489
so would we be.

1276
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:10,246
But the war began soon after my departure

1277
01:38:10,252 --> 01:38:14,380
and I wasn't able to return to
Germany until many years later.

1278
01:38:16,638 --> 01:38:19,674
I visited our café and I
searched all over Germany

1279
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,636
but I could find no trace of her.

1280
01:38:22,967 --> 01:38:27,184
I never saw Louise or the Baroness again.

1281
01:38:28,897 --> 01:38:32,599
I'm sorry. So that's why you never
want to talk about the Baron.

1282
01:38:32,845 --> 01:38:35,665
But you've done something
wonderful for me, Shizuku.

1283
01:38:35,769 --> 01:38:39,933
What was only a memory for me has
gained new life thanks to your story.

1284
01:38:40,018 --> 01:38:41,927
Oh, that reminds me.

1285
01:38:50,053 --> 01:38:52,326
Now hold out your hands.

1286
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,383
But I...

1287
01:38:59,471 --> 01:39:02,307
That geode suits you better than me.

1288
01:39:02,433 --> 01:39:03,892
I want you to have it.

1289
01:39:05,144 --> 01:39:07,726
Promise me you'll polish your story well.

1290
01:39:08,356 --> 01:39:09,526
I will.

1291
01:39:24,582 --> 01:39:26,372
Thanks for everything, Mr. Nishi.

1292
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:27,994
My pleasure.

1293
01:39:30,713 --> 01:39:32,373
See you later.

1294
01:39:42,487 --> 01:39:44,859
- Anyone home?
- I'm in here.

1295
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:49,599
Is Dad around?

1296
01:39:49,733 --> 01:39:50,907
He's in the bathtub.

1297
01:39:50,913 --> 01:39:53,310
Do you know what time it is, young lady?

1298
01:39:53,316 --> 01:39:55,273
I'd like to make a formal announcement.

1299
01:39:55,279 --> 01:39:57,780
I've decided that I want
to attend high school.

1300
01:39:57,869 --> 01:40:00,101
- I'll start studying tomorrow.
- Really?

1301
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,491
Does that mean you've already
finished your project?

1302
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:04,122
For the time being.

1303
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:08,366
Do you want dinner? I made curry.

1304
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:09,971
No, thanks.

1305
01:40:11,182 --> 01:40:13,286
For the time being, huh?

1306
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:25,479
Shizuku, the bathroom's
free if you want it.

1307
01:40:45,126 --> 01:40:47,794
Look at her, my little warrior.

1308
01:40:50,173 --> 01:40:51,750
Let's see.

1309
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:00,098
Sweet dreams.

1310
01:41:16,533 --> 01:41:18,194
Huh?

1311
01:41:54,389 --> 01:41:55,670
Seiji?

1312
01:42:03,292 --> 01:42:05,249
Yeah. Just a second.

1313
01:42:20,017 --> 01:42:22,509
I can't believe this. You
were actually awake.

1314
01:42:22,515 --> 01:42:24,144
This isn't a dream, is it?

1315
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:27,399
No. I came back from Italy
a day early. Get on.

1316
01:42:27,776 --> 01:42:29,603
Oh, wait a minute.

1317
01:42:29,695 --> 01:42:31,486
You'll be cold like that.

1318
01:42:33,908 --> 01:42:35,900
OK, hop on.

1319
01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:39,985
- You'll be cold. I'll get a jacket.
- There's not enough time. Let's go.

1320
01:42:41,776 --> 01:42:43,734
All right, hold on tight now.

1321
01:42:49,201 --> 01:42:51,573
I wanted to see you as soon as I got home,

1322
01:42:51,579 --> 01:42:54,670
so I stood outside your window hoping
you'd look outside and see me.

1323
01:42:54,948 --> 01:42:58,115
Suddenly you were standing there.
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1324
01:42:58,252 --> 01:43:00,785
We must be meant for each other, Shizuku.

1325
01:43:00,978 --> 01:43:02,900
I still can't believe I'm not dreaming.

1326
01:43:02,906 --> 01:43:05,147
Who cares? This is a great dream.

1327
01:43:10,665 --> 01:43:12,315
How did things go in Italy?

1328
01:43:12,321 --> 01:43:14,858
My master said I'm not
great yet, but I could be.

1329
01:43:14,864 --> 01:43:16,838
I've decided to finish high school first,

1330
01:43:16,844 --> 01:43:18,303
then I'll go back to Cremona.

1331
01:43:27,673 --> 01:43:30,205
- Should I get off?
- No. Stay on.

1332
01:43:30,332 --> 01:43:34,549
I decided I was going to
ride up this steep hill

1333
01:43:34,555 --> 01:43:36,383
carrying you with me.

1334
01:43:36,516 --> 01:43:38,404
Who said you could decide that?

1335
01:43:40,277 --> 01:43:42,649
I don't want to be just a burden for you.

1336
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:48,928
If I'm going with you
I'm going to help you.

1337
01:43:50,407 --> 01:43:52,747
All right, go ahead and help.

1338
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,778
Just a bit further.

1339
01:44:08,716 --> 01:44:11,717
Shizuku, hurry up! Get on!

1340
01:44:29,554 --> 01:44:31,593
Ah, just in time.

1341
01:44:32,826 --> 01:44:34,321
Wow.

1342
01:44:36,464 --> 01:44:38,373
- Need a hand?
- I'm fine.

1343
01:44:41,723 --> 01:44:43,098
Look at this.

1344
01:44:59,812 --> 01:45:01,293
Amazing.

1345
01:45:01,299 --> 01:45:03,916
With all that mist, it
looks like the ocean.

1346
01:45:03,922 --> 01:45:06,294
Yeah. This is where I come to get inspired.

1347
01:45:06,447 --> 01:45:08,156
You'll see in a second.

1348
01:45:52,944 --> 01:45:54,778
I wanted to show this to you.

1349
01:45:54,842 --> 01:45:56,336
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1350
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,324
Grandpa told me about all the
amazing writing you've been doing.

1351
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:03,723
I feel bad that I wasn't
here to encourage you.

1352
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:05,747
I was just off thinking about myself.

1353
01:46:06,757 --> 01:46:09,356
Mm-mmm. You're the one
who inspired me, Seiji.

1354
01:46:09,491 --> 01:46:11,200
I'm glad I pushed myself.

1355
01:46:11,206 --> 01:46:13,199
I know myself a little bit better now.

1356
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,565
I realized I need a lot more schooling,

1357
01:46:17,812 --> 01:46:20,806
so I don't mind doing what it takes
to get into a good high school.

1358
01:46:20,968 --> 01:46:23,795
Shizuku. I've been thinking.

1359
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:25,854
It's that...

1360
01:46:25,945 --> 01:46:28,401
I know this might sound
really weird to you,

1361
01:46:28,781 --> 01:46:31,071
but could you see us
getting married someday?

1362
01:46:32,436 --> 01:46:34,927
I promise I'll be a
professional violin maker

1363
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:37,189
and you can be a professional writer.

1364
01:46:39,418 --> 01:46:41,078
Mm-hmm.

1365
01:46:41,582 --> 01:46:43,334
Does this sound corny?

1366
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:46,376
It's a little corny, but you're
a violin maker, not a writer.

1367
01:46:46,403 --> 01:46:48,396
That's true. This is great!

1368
01:46:49,046 --> 01:46:51,760
Come here. It's getting cold.

1369
01:46:52,668 --> 01:46:55,548
Shizuku, I love you!
