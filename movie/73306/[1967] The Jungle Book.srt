1
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,320
Many strange legends are told
Of these jungles of India...

2
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:57,405
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.

3
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,242
It all began when the silence
Of the jungle was broken by
an unfamiliar sound.

4
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:14,455
It was a sound like one never heard
before in this part of the jungle.

5
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,000
It was a man cub!

6
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:26,127
Had I known how deeply
I was to be involved...

7
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:30,671
I would've obeyed my
first impulse and walked away.

8
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:44,094
This man cub would have to
have nourishment, and soon.

9
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:46,470
It was many days travel
to the nearest man village...

10
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:49,805
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.

11
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,973
Then it occurred to me.

12
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:58,851
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed with a litter of cubs.

13
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:05,006
Oh, I knew there'd be no problem
with the mother thanks to
the maternal instinct, but...

14
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:08,591
I wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.

15
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,607
Ten times the rains
had come and gone.

16
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:48,276
And I often stopped by to see how Mowgli
the man cub was getting along.

17
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:51,777
He was a favorite of all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.

18
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,953
No man cub was
ever happier.

19
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,121
And yet, I knew
that someday...

20
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,748
he would have to go back
to his own kind.

21
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:25,460
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at council rock...

22
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:28,419
because Shere Khan
the tiger...

23
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,671
had returned to
their part of the jungle.

24
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:36,299
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.

25
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:41,301
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.

26
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:45,094
Now, are we all in agreement
as to what must be done?

27
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:50,514
Now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boy's father.

28
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:54,349
Rama. Uh, come
over here, please.

29
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:58,642
- Yes, Akela?
- The council has reached its decision.

30
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:01,310
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.

31
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:04,645
- He must leave at once.
- Leave?

32
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,313
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.

33
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,148
But-- But the man cub is--
Well, he's like my own son.

34
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,192
Surely he's entitled to
the protection of the pack.

35
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:20,861
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack
is no match for the tiger.

36
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:24,779
But the boy cannot survive
alone in the jungle.

37
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:28,155
Akela. Perhaps
I can be of help.

38
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,948
You, Bagheera? How?

39
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:34,283
I know of a man village
where he'll be safe.

40
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:40,119
Mowgli and I have taken many
walks into the jungle together,
so I'm sure he'll go with me.

41
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:45,330
So be it. Now there's
no time to lose. Good luck.

42
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,587
Bagheera.

43
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,297
I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?

44
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:09,675
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.

45
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:13,218
- I'm taking you to a man village.
- But why?

46
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:16,845
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle.

47
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,222
And he has sworn
to kill you.

48
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,432
Kill me? But why would he
wanna do that?

49
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,558
He hates man.

50
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:29,851
And Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man--

51
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:32,060
just another hunter
with a gun.

52
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:35,770
Aw, we'll just explain to him that
I'd never do a thing like that.

53
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:39,897
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.

54
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:42,941
Well, maybe so.
But I'm not afraid.

55
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:46,067
- And besides, I--
- Now that's enough.

56
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,694
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.

57
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:54,655
Man cub? Man cub!

58
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,364
Now come on, up this tree.
Be safer up there.

59
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:04,283
I don't wanna go back
to the man village.

60
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:06,618
Go on. Up you go.

61
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:09,953
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.

62
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:16,206
Is that all the better
you can climb?

63
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:19,040
I-- Oh-- It's
too big around.

64
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,042
And besides, I don't
have any claws.

65
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:42,427
Now, get some sleep.

66
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:45,553
We've got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.

67
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:48,012
I-- I wanna stay
in the jungle.

68
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:51,222
Huh? You wouldn't
last one day.

69
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:57,850
I'm not afraid. I-I can
look out for myself.

70
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:11,565
Say now, what have we here?

71
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,234
It's a man cub.

72
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:20,027
A delicious man cub.

73
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,695
Oh, go away and
leave me alone.

74
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:27,239
Oh, that's just what I
should do, but I'm not.

75
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:30,365
Now, now, please go
to sleep, man cub.

76
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:38,410
Yes, man cub.
Please go to sleep.

77
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:41,412
Please go to sleep

78
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:44,747
Sleep, little man cub

79
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:47,623
Rest in peace

80
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:57,003
Sleep. Sleep.

81
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,296
Ba-- Ba-Bagh-gheera.

82
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,590
Oh, now-- Now look, there's
no use arguing any more.

83
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:10,217
Oh! Now no more talk
till morning.

84
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:13,094
He won't be here
in the morning.

85
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:16,595
Hmm? Oh, yes, he will.
I-- Kaa!

86
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,596
Hold it, Kaa!

87
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:24,765
Oh! My sinus.

88
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:30,102
You have just made
a serious mistake, my friend.

89
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:33,060
A very stupid...

90
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:37,521
- Now, now, now, now, Kaa, I was--
- mistake.

91
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:40,273
Look me in the eye when
I'm speaking to you.

92
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:43,941
- Oh, please, Kaa.
- Both eyes, if you please.

93
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:51,778
You have just
sealed your doom.

94
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:01,783
Look, Bagheera!
Look, Bagheera.

95
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:03,950
Wake up, Bagheera.

96
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:11,746
Just you wait till
I get you in my coils.

97
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:16,956
Bagheera, he's got
a knot in his tail!

98
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:19,123
"He's got a knot
in his tail."

99
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,754
Ooh, this is going to
slow down my slither.

100
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,466
So, you can look out
For yourself, can you?

101
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,092
So you want to stay
in the jungle, do you?

102
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,136
Yes. I wanna stay
in the jungle.

103
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:47,804
Oh! Now, now, now for
the last time, go to sleep!

104
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:52,264
Man cub.

105
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,266
Man cub.

106
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:25,405
Hup, two, three, four

107
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,239
Keep it up
Two, three, four

108
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,490
Hup, two, three, four

109
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:33,200
Keep it up
Two, three, four

110
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,201
Hup, two, three, four

111
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,494
A parade.

112
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:42,787
Oh, no!
The dawn patrol again.

113
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,417
Company, sound off!

114
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:55,377
Oh, the aim of our patrol
Is a question rather droll

115
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,336
For to march and drill
Over field and hill

116
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:03,047
Is a military goal

117
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,674
Is a military goal

118
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,008
With a hup
Two, three, four

119
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:10,550
Dress it up
two, three, four

120
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:13,010
By the ranks or single file

121
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:15,344
Over every jungle mile

122
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,304
Oh, west amp and crush
through the underbrush

123
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:23,056
In the military style

124
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:26,225
In the military style

125
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:28,226
Hello. What are you doing?

126
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,185
Shh! Drilling.

127
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,061
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.

128
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:38,022
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.

129
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,775
To the rear! March!

130
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,694
The other way.
Turn around.

131
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:52,987
Hup, two, three, four

132
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:56,113
Keep it up
Two, three, four

133
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:59,907
To the rear! Ho!

134
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:05,659
Company, halt!

135
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:08,994
That means stop.

136
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:12,246
Company, left face!

137
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:19,249
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.

138
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,958
I'm puttin' in for
a transfer to another herd.

139
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:24,418
Silence in the ranks!

140
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,130
Dress up that line.

141
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:36,382
Pull it in, Winifred.

142
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,884
Inspection! Arms!

143
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,512
Stick your nose out.

144
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,554
- Like this?
- That's right.

145
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:54,265
A dusty muzzle.

146
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:58,684
Soldier, remember, in battle,
that trunk can save your life.

147
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,435
- Take good care of it, my man.
- Yes, sir!

148
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:03,437
Very good. Cary on.

149
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:13,190
- Let's have a little more spit
and polish on those bayonets.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:15,275
Esprit de corps.

151
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:19,944
That's the way I earned my commission in
the Maharajah's fifth pachyderm brigade.

152
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:23,237
Back in '88, it was.
Uh, or was it?

153
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:27,573
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.

154
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:30,490
It was then I received
the Victoria Cross...

155
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:35,368
for bravely  above and
beyond the call of duty.

156
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,368
Those were the days.

157
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,745
Discipline.
Discipline was the thing.

158
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:44,121
Builds character, and all that
sort of thing, you know.

159
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:50,958
Oh, oh, where was I?
Oh, yes. Inspection.

160
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,960
Well, very good.

161
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:58,128
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.

162
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:05,048
Eyes front.

163
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,092
Lieutenant, that haircut
is not regulation.

164
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:11,593
Rather on the gaudy side,
don't you think?

165
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,677
There. That's better.

166
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:17,137
And as for you--

167
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:20,805
Oh, there you are.

168
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:24,807
Let's keep those heels
together, shall we, son?

169
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:27,475
Okay, Pop. Sir.

170
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,935
Yes, now that's better.

171
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,978
Well, a new recruit, eh?

172
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:36,104
I say, what happened
to your trunk?

173
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,105
Hey! Stop that!

174
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,733
A man cub!
Oh, this is treason!

175
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:46,109
Sabotage! I'll have
no man cub in my jungle!

176
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:51,320
-I-It's not your jungle!
-Hold it! Hold it! I can explain, Hathi.

177
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,988
Colonel Hathi,
If you please, sir.

178
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:57,323
Oh, yes, yes.
Colonel Hathi.

179
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,783
Uh, the man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man village.

180
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,493
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.

181
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:10,995
Good. And remember,
an elephant never forgets.

182
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:16,206
I don't know what the army's
coming to these days.

183
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,541
These young whippersnappers,
who do they think they are?

184
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:24,627
Let's get on with it!
Right face!

185
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:26,919
Forward march!

186
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,174
Dear, haven't you
forgotten something?

187
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:42,719
Nonsense, Winifred old girl.
An elephant never forgets.

188
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:46,387
Well, you just
forgot our son.

189
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:48,804
Uh, uh, son-- Son?

190
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,806
Son! Oh, yes, yeah, yeah!
Quite right.

191
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:53,848
To the rear! March!

192
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:02,102
When I grow up, I'm gonna be
a Colonel, just like my--

193
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:05,187
- If I've told you once, I've
told you a thousand times--
- Oh!

194
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,772
Pop! Look out!

195
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:23,946
Gee, Pop, you forgot
to say "halt."

196
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:28,531
He said an elephant
never forgets.

197
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:35,118
It's not funny.

198
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:38,452
Now let's get out of here quick
before anything else happens.

199
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:46,456
Bagheera!
Where are we goin'?

200
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:50,124
You're going back to
the man village right now.

201
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:53,960
- I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are!

202
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:56,169
I'm staying right here!

203
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:59,795
You're going if I have to
drag you every step of the way.

204
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:05,173
- Let go, you--
- You let go of me!

205
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:17,846
Oh, that does it.

206
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:20,722
I've had it, man cub!

207
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:25,975
From now on, you're
on your own alone!

208
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,559
Don't worry about me.

209
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,908
Foolish man cub.

210
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,089
Doo-bee doo-bee
doo-bee-dee-doo

211
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:37,549
Well, it'sa doo-bah-dee-doo
Yes, it'sa doo-bah-dee-doo

212
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:42,802
lmean a doo-bee doo-bee, doo-bee
doo-bee, doo-bee-dee-doo

213
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,719
And with--

214
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,805
Well, now.

215
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,805
What have we here?

216
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,892
Hey, what a funny
little bit of a--

217
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,227
- Oh!
- Go away!

218
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:05,354
Oh, boy, I've seen
everything in these woods.

219
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:08,522
Hoo! What have I run on?
What a pretty thing this is.

220
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:11,940
- Leave me alone.
- Well, now.

221
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:14,942
That's pretty big talk,
little britches.

222
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,943
I'm big enough.

223
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:24,070
Pitiful. Hey, kid,
you need help.

224
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:27,948
And old Baloo's gonna learn you
to fight like a bear.

225
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:29,948
Now come on,
I'm gonna show you.

226
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:35,952
Yeah!

227
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:39,745
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose and then start to weave.

228
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:42,246
Weave a little.
Now move! That's it!

229
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:45,206
Now give me a big bear growl.
Scare me.

230
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,167
Oh, boy.

231
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:54,252
I'm talkin' about
like a big bear.

232
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,797
He's in trouble! Why, I-I
shouldn't have left him alone.

233
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,718
- A big one. Right from your toes.
- How's that?

234
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:23,723
- Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid.
- Oh, no! It's Baloo.

235
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:27,100
That shiftless,
stupid jungle bum.

236
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:29,810
Weave about now and
look for an opening.

237
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:31,811
Keep movin'. Keep--

238
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,979
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid.
Come on, that's it.

239
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:39,398
He's a dandy.

240
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:45,651
Fine teacher you are,
old iron paws.

241
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:49,528
- Oh, thanks, Bagheera.
- Eh, tell me, tell me, uh...

242
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:54,738
after you knock your pupil
senseless, uh, how do you expect
him to remember the lesson? Hmm?

243
00:23:54,905 --> 00:24:00,741
Well, I-- I, uh-- Well, I didn't
mean to lay it on him so hard.

244
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:03,826
I'm not hurt.
I'm all right.

245
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,076
I'm a lot tougher than
some people think.

246
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:08,244
You better believe it.

247
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,830
Now let's go once more.
Now I want you to keep circlin'
or I'm gonna knoc kyour roof in again.

248
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,831
You better keep movin'.

249
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:17,832
Hey! Right on the button.

250
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:29,337
No, no-no, no-no.
Now you're ticklin'.

251
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:35,340
No! No. N-N-Now, now we don't
do that here in the jungle.

252
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:40,259
No, you're ticklin'.
I-I can't stand that ticklin'.

253
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:44,845
- Help, Bagheera!
- Oh, boy, that's all he needs.
More confidence.

254
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:48,305
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya.

255
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,847
Ooh! I give-- Hey!

256
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:56,808
You know somethin'? You're all right,
kid. What do they call you?

257
00:24:56,976 --> 00:25:01,019
Mowgli. And he's going back
to the man village right now.

258
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:04,979
Man village? They'll ruin him.
They'll make a man out of him.

259
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,855
Oh, Baloo, I wanna
stay here with you.

260
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:09,981
Certainly you do.

261
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:14,525
Oh? And just how do you
think he will survive?

262
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:19,069
"How do you think he will--" What do
you mean, "How do you think he--"

263
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:22,362
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.

264
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:25,738
Well, that shouldn't
take too long.

265
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:30,907
Look, now it's like this,
little britches.

266
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:33,909
All you've gotta do is--

267
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:39,244
Look forthe bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

268
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:43,205
Forget about your worries
And your strife

269
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:48,332
I mean the bare necessities
are Mother Nature's recipes

270
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:52,584
That bring the bare
necessities of life

271
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:57,253
Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam

272
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,963
I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home

273
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:07,133
The bee sare buzzin' in the tree
to make some honey just for me

274
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,717
When you look under
the rocks and plants

275
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,843
And take a glance
at the fancy ants

276
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,844
Then maybe try a few

277
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,387
You eat ants?

278
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:20,889
You better believe it. And you're
gonna love the way they tickle.

279
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,890
Mowgli, look out!

280
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:27,558
- The bare necessities
of life will come to you
- But when?

281
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,935
They'll come to you

282
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:35,354
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

283
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,231
Forget about your worries
And your strife

284
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,190
I mean the bare necessities

285
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:44,567
That's why a bear
can rest at ease

286
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:48,652
With just the bare necessities
Of life

287
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:50,986
Now when you pick a paw paw

288
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:53,363
- Or a prickly pear
- Ow!

289
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:57,948
And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time, beware

290
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:00,240
Don't pick the prickly pear
By the paw

291
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:03,075
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw

292
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:08,453
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big paw paw

293
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:12,329
- Have I given you a clue?
- Golly. Thanks, Baloo.

294
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,331
Pawpaw.

295
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:16,707
Of all the silly gibberish.

296
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:18,958
Come on, Baghee,
get with the beat.

297
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:23,585
- The bare necessities
of life will come to you
- They'll come to me!

298
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,211
They'll come to you

299
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,254
How 'bout scratchin' that ol' left
shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?

300
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:34,507
Now just a hair lower.
There. Right there. That's it.

301
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:37,925
Oh! This is beautiful.

302
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,177
That's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.

303
00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:45,178
You're lots of fun, Baloo.

304
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:49,305
Right on it. Yeah!

305
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:54,016
That's delicious.

306
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,101
Just a little bit--

307
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:01,102
Yeah!

308
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,484
Yeah.

309
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:26,322
Oh, man, this is
really livin'.

310
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:31,783
So just try and relax.

311
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,326
Yeah. Cool it.

312
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:38,119
Fall apart in my backyard.

313
00:28:38,245 --> 00:28:40,954
'Cause let me tell you somethin',
little britches.

314
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,621
If you act like
that bee acts...

315
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:47,998
uh-uh, you're
workin' too hard.

316
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:51,959
And don't spend your time
lookin' around...

317
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:57,128
for something you want
that can't be found.

318
00:28:57,254 --> 00:29:01,672
When you find out you can live without
it and go along not thinkin' about it

319
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,840
I'll tell you somethin' true

320
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:09,842
The bare necessities
Of life will come to you

321
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:13,677
I give up. Well, I hope
his luck holds out.

322
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:16,429
Mowgli, how 'bout you sing?

323
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:21,806
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

324
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:25,808
- Forget about your worries
and your strife
- Yeah, man.

325
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:28,726
I mean the bare necessities

326
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,103
That's why a bear
can rest at ease

327
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,937
With just the bare necessities
Of life

328
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:38,898
- Yeah!
- With just the bare necessities of life

329
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:40,899
Yeah, man!

330
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:46,151
Beautiful!
That's real jungle harmony.

331
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:50,653
- I like being a bear.
- That's my boy.

332
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,488
And you're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.

333
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:17,207
Hey, Mowgli, how 'bout you
flickin' that old, mean fly...

334
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:20,542
of fo' your
papa bear's nose?

335
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:23,251
Ouch!

336
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:27,544
Boy, when you flick a fly,
you really--

337
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,297
Why you flat-nosed,
little-eyed, flaky creep!

338
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:35,674
Hey! Let go of me!

339
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,675
Take your flea-pickin' hands
Of fo' my cub!

340
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:40,676
Come on and get him, champ!

341
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:43,177
- He ain't no champ. He's a chump!
- Baloo!

342
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,220
Yeah! A big hothead!

343
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,721
Okay, you guys asked for it.
I'll--

344
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,722
That'll cool him off.

345
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,099
Gimme back my man cub!

346
00:30:53,224 --> 00:30:55,641
Here he is.
Come and get him!

347
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:00,811
That's how a bear
can rest at ease.

348
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:02,853
Here's some bare necessities.

349
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,898
Now just try that again, you--

350
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:13,483
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity.

351
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,234
Look, monk, you turn him loose
or I'll jerk a knot in your tail--

352
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,278
We give up!
Here he comes!

353
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,571
Baloo! Catch me!

354
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:27,364
- Baloo!
- Back up! Back up!
Faster! Faster! Faster!

355
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:33,033
A rolling bear
gathers no hair!

356
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:41,829
Baloo! Help me!
Baloo, they're carrying me away!

357
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:44,622
Bagheera!

358
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:47,457
Bagheera!

359
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:49,833
Well, it's happened.

360
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:52,251
Took a little longer than I thought,
but it's happened.

361
00:31:56,795 --> 00:31:58,670
Bagheera!

362
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,673
Oh, you heard me, huh?

363
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,175
Mowgli. Mowgli!

364
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,176
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?

365
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,385
They ambushed me.
Thousands of'em.

366
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:17,262
I jabbed with my left. Then I swung
with a right. And then I let--

367
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:21,431
Oh, for the last time,
what happened to Mowgli?

368
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:25,517
Like I told ya, them
mangy monkeys carried him off.

369
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:31,102
The ancient ruins.
Oh, I hate to think what'll happen
when he meets that king of theirs.

370
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,198
- We got him, King Louie!
- Here he is. Man, we got him.
We got him!

371
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:05,868
So you're the man cub.
Crazy.

372
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:09,619
I'm not as crazy as you are.
Put me down!

373
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:13,497
You cut that out!

374
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:17,540
Cool it, boy.
Unwind yourself.

375
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:23,627
Now come on,
let's shake, cousin.

376
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,877
What do you want me for?

377
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:31,130
Word has grabbed my royal ear--
Have a banana--

378
00:33:31,297 --> 00:33:33,798
that you wanna
stay in the jungle.

379
00:33:33,923 --> 00:33:36,799
Stay in the jungle?
I sure do.

380
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:39,633
Well, good.
And old King Louie--

381
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:44,469
That's me--
can fix it for you.

382
00:33:46,846 --> 00:33:50,180
Have two bananas.

383
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:52,432
- Have we got a deal?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,183
I'll do-- I'll do anything
to stay in the jungle.

385
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:57,809
Well, then.

386
00:33:58,935 --> 00:34:00,935
I'll lay it on
the line for you.

387
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:09,105
Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VlP

388
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:11,440
I've reached the top
And had to stop

389
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:14,025
And that's what's botherin' me

390
00:34:14,192 --> 00:34:18,902
I wanna be a man, man cub
And stroll right into town

391
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:23,238
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around

392
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:25,489
Oh, ooh-bee-doo

393
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:28,407
I wanna be likeyou

394
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:33,242
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you too

395
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,910
You see it's true

396
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:38,661
An ape like me

397
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:43,330
Can learn to be human too

398
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,625
What?

399
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:33,562
Gee, Cousin Louie,
you're doin' real good.

400
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,896
Now here's your part
Of the deal, cuz.

401
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:40,732
Lay the secret on me
of man's red fire.

402
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:43,066
But I don't know
how to make fire.

403
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:47,901
Now don't try to kid me, man cub
I made a deal with you

404
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:50,486
What I desire
Is man's red fire

405
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,737
To make my dream come true

406
00:35:52,863 --> 00:35:57,740
Now give me the secret, man cub
Come on, clue me what to do

407
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,283
Give me the power
Of man's red flower

408
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,451
So I can be like you

409
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:07,411
Fire? So that's what
that scoundrel's after.

410
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:10,620
I'll tear him limb from limb.
I'll beat him.

411
00:36:10,788 --> 00:36:13,831
I'll-- I'll--

412
00:36:13,998 --> 00:36:15,748
Yeah!

413
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,998
Well, man, what a beat.

414
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:21,042
Will you stop that silly
beat business and listen?

415
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:23,209
This will take brains,
not brawn.

416
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:26,795
You better believe it,
and I'm loaded with both.

417
00:36:26,962 --> 00:36:29,963
- Will you listen?
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

418
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,464
Now, while you
create a disturbance...

419
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,466
I'll rescue Mowgli.
Got that?

420
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:40,009
I'm gone, man. Solid gone.

421
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:42,760
Not yet, Baloo!

422
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,225
Hey!

423
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,694
Get mad, baby.

424
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:29,407
You
l wanna be like you

425
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:34,451
l wanna walk like you
Talk like you too

426
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:36,828
You see it's true

427
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:39,870
Someone like me

428
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,955
Can learn to be
Like someone like me

429
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:44,956
Take me home, daddy!

430
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:48,291
Can learn to be
Like someone like you

431
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:51,125
- One more time!
- Yeah, can learn to be

432
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:54,294
Like someone like me

433
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:02,797
- Man!
- It's Baloo, the bear!

434
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:05,632
Yeah, that's him!
How'd that square get in there?

435
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:07,633
Baloo, it's you!

436
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:23,918
Man, that's what I call
a swingin' party.

437
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,848
And furthermore, Baloo...

438
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:55,225
Mowgli seems to have man's
ability to get into trouble.

439
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,226
And your influence
hasn't been exactly--

440
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:01,352
Shh. Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.

441
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:04,062
- Dah.
- Well, he's had a big day.

442
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:06,271
It was a real sockaroo.

443
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:09,273
You know, it ain't easy
learnin' to be like me.

444
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,107
Pah!
A disgraceful performance.

445
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:15,984
Associating with those undesirable,
scatterbrained apes.

446
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,194
Unh. I hope Mowgli learned
something from that experience.

447
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:26,156
Scooby-dooby,
dooby-doo.

448
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:30,616
That's my boy.

449
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,076
Oh, nonsense.

450
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:48,791
Baloo.

451
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:51,793
Over here. I'd like
to have a word with you.

452
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:55,336
A word? You gonna
talk some more?

453
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,964
All right,
what's up, Bagheera?

454
00:41:02,756 --> 00:41:04,423
Baloo...

455
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:08,842
the man cub must go back
to the man village.

456
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,635
The jungle is not
the place for him.

457
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,554
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.

458
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,180
Yes, just look at yourself.

459
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:21,306
Look at that eye.

460
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:25,141
Yeah. It's beautiful,
ain't it?

461
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:28,393
Yeah. Frankly, you're
a disreputable sight.

462
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:32,394
Well, you don't look exactly
like a basket off ruit yourself.

463
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,605
Ohh.

464
00:41:38,106 --> 00:41:42,983
Baloo, you can't adopt
Mowgli as your son.

465
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:45,775
Why not?

466
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:50,653
H-H-How can I put it?
It-- Baloo...

467
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:54,530
birds of a feather
should flock together.

468
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:56,697
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would you?

469
00:41:56,865 --> 00:41:59,324
I don't know.

470
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:03,951
Come to think of it,
no panther ever asked me.

471
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:06,827
No. Baloo, you-you've got
to be serious about this.

472
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:09,537
Oh, stop woryin', Baghee.
Stop woryin'.

473
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:11,537
I'll take care of him.

474
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,664
Yes. Like you did when
the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?

475
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,583
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.

476
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,584
And another thing.

477
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:25,586
Sooner or later, Mowgli
will meet Shere Khan.

478
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:29,295
The tiger? What's he got
against the kid?

479
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,965
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.

480
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,091
Because he fears man's gun
and man's fire.

481
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:38,800
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.

482
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:41,802
Shere Khan won't wait
until he does.

483
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:45,470
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.

484
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,722
-Just one swipe and--
- No.

485
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:52,390
Well-- Well, what
are we gonna do?

486
00:42:52,557 --> 00:42:54,432
- We'll do what's best for the boy.
- You better believe it.

487
00:42:54,558 --> 00:42:56,225
You name it,
and I'll do it.

488
00:42:56,392 --> 00:43:00,102
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man village.

489
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:02,436
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him...

490
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:04,438
he could stay here
in the jungle with me.

491
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:08,315
Well, that's just the point.
As long as he remains with you...

492
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,982
he's in danger,
so it's up to you.

493
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:14,692
- Why me?
- Be-Be-Because he won't listen to me.

494
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,693
I love that kid.

495
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:20,736
I love him like
he was my own cub.

496
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:24,363
Then think of what's best
for Mowgli and not yourself.

497
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,240
Uh, well, can't-- Well,
can't I wait until morning?

498
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:30,241
It's morning now.

499
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,244
Go on, Baloo.

500
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,414
Uh--

501
00:43:55,878 --> 00:43:58,045
Oh, boy.

502
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:03,006
Mowgli. Mowgli.

503
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:05,591
Uh, it's time to get up.

504
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:09,634
Oh. Hi, Baloo.

505
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:13,552
Hi. Hey, rub that old
sleep out of your eyes.

506
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:18,097
You and me, uh, we got
a long walk ahead of us.

507
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,473
Swell. Gee, we'll have
lots of fun together.

508
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:27,351
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah. Uh--

509
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:30,310
All right, let's
hit the trail, kid.

510
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:33,687
See ya around,
uh, Bagheera.

511
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:35,729
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.

512
00:44:35,897 --> 00:44:38,898
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.

513
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:43,358
Goodbye, man cub.
And good luck.

514
00:44:43,525 --> 00:44:46,651
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is--

515
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:49,486
Look for the bare necessities

516
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,821
Some good old bare necessities

517
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:55,948
Forget about your worries
And your strife

518
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:58,824
l mean the bare necessities

519
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:01,116
That's why a bear
can rest at ease

520
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:04,994
With just the bare
necessities of life

521
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,828
Yeah I'll live here
in the jungle

522
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:10,662
All my life
Yeah, man

523
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,414
I like bein' a bear.

524
00:45:14,873 --> 00:45:18,999
- Where we goin', Baloo?
- Well, uh, it's, uh--

525
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,834
Um, well, it's
sort of new and, uh--

526
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,711
Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.

527
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,879
Mowgli, uh,
look, buddy, uh...

528
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:31,047
there's somethin'
I gotta tell ya.

529
00:45:31,172 --> 00:45:33,506
Tell me what, Baloo?

530
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:36,550
Gee whiz.

531
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:39,926
Now how did old Baghee
put it? It's, uh--

532
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:42,719
Uh, uh, Mowgli?

533
00:45:42,844 --> 00:45:46,929
Ha! You wouldn't marry
a panther, would you?

534
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:50,931
Gee, I don't even know
what you're talkin' about.

535
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:54,391
Mowgli, don't you realize
that you're a human?

536
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:57,601
I'm not any more, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.

537
00:45:57,768 --> 00:45:59,477
Little buddy, look,
listen to me.

538
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:02,645
- Come on. Come on, Baloo.
- Now, Mowgli, stop it now.

539
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:05,271
Now hold still. I-I want
to tell you something.

540
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:07,313
Now listen to me.

541
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:09,982
- What's the matter, old Papa Bear?
- Look, Mowgli...

542
00:46:10,149 --> 00:46:12,900
I been tyin' to tell ya.
I been tyin' all morning to tell ya.

543
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:16,359
I've got to take you
back to the man village.

544
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,486
- The man village!
- Now look, kid...

545
00:46:18,611 --> 00:46:21,403
- I can explain, and--
- But, but you said we were partners.

546
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:25,072
- Now believe me, kid, I-I-I--
- You're just like, like old Bagheera!

547
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:28,573
Now just a minute.
That's goin' too far.

548
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,033
Hey, Mowgli,
where you goin'?

549
00:46:34,535 --> 00:46:36,494
Wait a minute! Stop!

550
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:39,870
Wait!

551
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:42,705
Wait! Listen to old Baloo.

552
00:46:42,872 --> 00:46:45,456
Mowgli. Mowgli!

553
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:48,791
Mowgli!

554
00:46:51,585 --> 00:46:56,253
- Mowgli. Mowgli!
- Now what's happened?

555
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,004
Well, you, you, you're not
gonna believe me, Bagheera...

556
00:46:59,172 --> 00:47:03,423
but look, now I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me.

557
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:05,466
Well, don't just stand there.

558
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:08,967
Let's separate.
We-- We've got to find him.

559
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:11,259
Oh, if anything happens
to that little guy...

560
00:47:11,386 --> 00:47:14,095
I'll never forgive myself.

561
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:17,221
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!

562
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:20,806
Mowgli.

563
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,162
Hup, two, three, four

564
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:12,372
Hup, two, three, four

565
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:14,498
Keep it up
Two, three

566
00:48:14,665 --> 00:48:17,041
What beastly luck.

567
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,875
Confound that ridiculous
Colonel Hathi.

568
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:22,585
Company, sound off.

569
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,877
Oh, we march from here to there

570
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:27,546
And it doesn't matter where

571
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:30,214
You can hear us push
through the deepest bush

572
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,422
Hup, two, three, four

573
00:48:32,548 --> 00:48:34,965
With a military air

574
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,800
With a military air

575
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:42,886
The jungle patrol.

576
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:47,513
We're a cracker jack brigade

577
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:49,930
On a pachyderm parade

578
00:48:50,098 --> 00:48:52,932
But we'd rather stroll
to a waterhole

579
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:55,017
Hup, two, three, four

580
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:57,643
For a furlough in the shade

581
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,603
Stop! W-Wait a minute.

582
00:49:01,728 --> 00:49:03,812
Halt!

583
00:49:05,355 --> 00:49:09,231
Who said halt?
I give the commands around here.

584
00:49:09,399 --> 00:49:14,568
- Now speak up. Who was it?
- Oh, it was me, Colonel.

585
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:16,901
What do you mean, sir,
taking over my command?

586
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:19,986
- Highly irregular, you know.
- Oh, Colonel, I-I'm sorry...

587
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:23,655
- but, but I need your help.
- Oh, absolutely impossible.

588
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,323
- We're on a cross-county march.
- But it's an emergency, Colonel.

589
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:31,242
- The man cub must be found.
- Man cub? What man cub?

590
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:36,453
-How interesting.
-The one I was taking to the man village.

591
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:38,911
Good.
That's where he belongs.

592
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,913
Now, sir,
If you don't mind...

593
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,914
we'd like to get on
with the march.

594
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,498
No, no, no, you,
you don't understand, Hathi.

595
00:49:46,624 --> 00:49:50,125
He is lost.
He ran away.

596
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:52,376
How delightful.

597
00:49:52,544 --> 00:49:55,837
Well, serves the young
whippersnapper right.

598
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:58,838
But, but Shere Khan,
the tiger--

599
00:49:59,005 --> 00:50:01,464
He's sure to pick up
the man cub's trail.

600
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,841
Shere Khan.
Nonsense, old boy.

601
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:08,884
Shere Khan isn't
within miles of here.

602
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:14,011
Oh, sorry, Bagheera.

603
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,304
Fortunes of war, and all that
sort of thing, you know.

604
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,515
This has gone far enough.
Far enough.

605
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,350
Now just a minute,
you pompous old windbag.

606
00:50:25,517 --> 00:50:29,018
Winifred! What are you
doing out of ranks?

607
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:31,102
Never mind.

608
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,270
How would you like
to have our boy...

609
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:35,605
lost and alone
in the jungle?

610
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:39,023
Our son? W-Well--

611
00:50:39,148 --> 00:50:42,441
But, Winifred old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.

612
00:50:42,608 --> 00:50:45,359
- Huh!
- Different, entirely.

613
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:49,069
That little boy is no different
than our own son.

614
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:52,863
Now you help find him,
or I'm taking over command.

615
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,697
What! A female
leading my herd?

616
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:57,573
Utterly preposterous.

617
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,741
Pop? The man cub and I
are friends.

618
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:03,576
He'll get hurt
If we don't find him.

619
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,286
Please, Pop? Sir?
Please?

620
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:10,329
Now don't you worry, son.

621
00:51:10,455 --> 00:51:14,039
Your father had a plan
in mind all the time.

622
00:51:16,499 --> 00:51:19,000
Sure you did.

623
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:24,878
Troopers!
Company, left face!

624
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:28,963
Volunteers for
a special mission...

625
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,005
will step
one pace forward.

626
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:47,304
That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.

627
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:53,057
Now, you volunteers
will find the lost man cub.

628
00:51:53,183 --> 00:51:56,309
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
Now there's no time to lose.

629
00:51:56,434 --> 00:52:00,060
Yes, yes.
Well, bugler.

630
00:52:00,228 --> 00:52:04,146
When the man cub is sighted,
you will sound your trumpet...

631
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:06,438
- three times.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:52:09,232 --> 00:52:10,941
Not now, soldier.

633
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:13,233
Sorry, sir.

634
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,360
Lieutenant, our strategy shall
be the element of surprise.

635
00:52:17,527 --> 00:52:20,278
You will take one squad...

636
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:23,822
- and cover the right flank.
- Yes, sir.

637
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:26,281
And I shall lead
the other squad...

638
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:28,740
on the left flank.

639
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:33,493
Very well. Company...

640
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:37,744
forward march!

641
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,417
Element of surprise?

642
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,626
Oh, I say.

643
00:52:54,169 --> 00:52:59,004
And now for my rendezvous
with the little lost man cub.

644
00:54:25,753 --> 00:54:28,295
Kaa! It's you!

645
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:30,880
Yes, man cub.

646
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:33,757
So nice to see you again.

647
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:38,967
Oh, go away.
Leave me alone.

648
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:44,095
Let me look at you.

649
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,971
You don't want me
to look at you?

650
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:50,973
Then you look at me.

651
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,141
No, sir. I know what
you're tryin' to do, Kaa--

652
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:57,059
You do? Uh, I mean...

653
00:54:57,185 --> 00:54:59,977
- you don't trust me.
- No.

654
00:55:00,144 --> 00:55:03,979
Then there's nothing
I can do to help.

655
00:55:04,146 --> 00:55:05,980
You wanna help me?

656
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:08,314
Certainly.

657
00:55:08,482 --> 00:55:13,484
I can see to it that you never
have to leave this jungle.

658
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:16,485
How could you do that?

659
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:19,611
Hmm? Oh, I have my own...

660
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:23,613
subtle little ways.

661
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,616
But first,
you must trust me.

662
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:32,743
I don't trust
anyone any more.

663
00:55:34,118 --> 00:55:36,660
I don't blame you.

664
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:39,037
I'm not like
those so-called...

665
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:42,330
fair-weather friends
of yours.

666
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:45,665
You can believe in me.

667
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:51,793
Trust in me

668
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:55,669
Just in me

669
00:55:56,879 --> 00:56:01,005
Shut your eyes

670
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:04,757
And trust in me

671
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,300
Hold still, please.

672
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:10,802
You can sleep

673
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:14,845
Safe and sound

674
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:20,681
Knowing I

675
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:25,558
Am around

676
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:31,269
Slip into silent slumber

677
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:35,105
Sail on a silver mist

678
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:38,564
Slow Iy and sure lyyoursenses

679
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,608
Will cease to resist

680
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,777
You're snoring.

681
00:56:48,903 --> 00:56:51,570
Sorry.

682
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:54,864
Trust in me

683
00:56:54,989 --> 00:57:00,366
And just in me

684
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:04,534
Shut your eyes

685
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:09,204
And trust in me

686
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,417
Oh, now what?

687
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:20,418
I'll be right down.

688
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:25,545
Yes? Yes?
Who is it?

689
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,129
It's me, Shere Khan.

690
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:30,756
I'd like a word with you
If you don't mind.

691
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:33,507
Shere Khan.

692
00:57:33,674 --> 00:57:35,883
What a surprise.

693
00:57:36,008 --> 00:57:38,300
Yes, isn't it?

694
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:42,719
I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

695
00:57:42,845 --> 00:57:44,804
Oh, no, no,
nothing at all.

696
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:48,930
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.

697
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:51,515
Coils? Someone?
Oh, no.

698
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,475
I was just curling up
for my siesta.

699
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:59,435
But you were singing to someone.
Who is it, Kaa?

700
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:03,145
Uh, who? Oh, no.

701
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:08,023
Well, I was just singing,
uh, to myself.

702
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:10,732
- Indeed.
- Yes. Yes, you see...

703
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:14,859
I have trouble
with my sinuses.

704
00:58:15,026 --> 00:58:18,194
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.

705
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,362
It's simply terrible.

706
00:58:20,487 --> 00:58:23,446
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

707
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:27,240
So I sing myself to sleep.

708
00:58:27,407 --> 00:58:30,741
You know, self-hypnosis.

709
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:34,201
Let me show you
how it works.

710
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:38,786
Ah, trust in me

711
00:58:40,913 --> 00:58:45,123
No, I can't be bothered with that. I
have no time for that sort of nonsense.

712
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,582
Some other time perhaps?

713
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:51,501
Perhaps. But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.

714
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:54,253
Man cub? What man cub?

715
00:58:54,378 --> 00:58:56,503
The one who's lost.

716
00:58:56,671 --> 00:58:59,255
Now where do you suppose
he could be?

717
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,673
- Search me.
- That's an excellent idea.

718
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:07,467
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me
your coils, would you, Kaa?

719
00:59:07,634 --> 00:59:09,676
Uh, certainly not.

720
00:59:11,427 --> 00:59:13,469
Nothing here.

721
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:15,762
And nothing in here.

722
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:26,018
My sinuses.

723
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:29,727
Hmm. Indeed.

724
00:59:29,894 --> 00:59:33,062
And now, how about
the middle?

725
00:59:33,229 --> 00:59:35,229
The middle?

726
00:59:35,355 --> 00:59:37,314
Oh, the middle.

727
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:45,276
Absolutely nothing
in the middle.

728
00:59:48,278 --> 00:59:50,820
Really?

729
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:54,364
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub...

730
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:58,449
you will inform me first,
understand?

731
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:03,951
I get the point.
Cross my heart, hope to die.

732
01:00:04,077 --> 01:00:06,286
Good show.

733
01:00:06,453 --> 01:00:10,288
And now I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.

734
01:00:12,331 --> 01:00:15,290
Ooh, who does he think
he's fooling?

735
01:00:15,457 --> 01:00:17,291
"The helpless little lad."

736
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:21,126
Ooh, he gives me
the shivers.

737
01:00:23,544 --> 01:00:27,420
Picking on that poor
little helpless boy.

738
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:31,381
Oh, yes.

739
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:34,382
Poor little helpless boy.

740
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:45,179
You told me a lie, Kaa.

741
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:47,179
You said
I could trust you.

742
01:00:47,305 --> 01:00:49,931
It's like you said.

743
01:00:50,056 --> 01:00:53,224
You can't trust anyone.

744
01:00:58,727 --> 01:01:02,645
If I never see that
skinny little shrimp again...

745
01:01:02,812 --> 01:01:04,979
it will be too soon.

746
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:09,731
Ooh, my sacroiliac.

747
01:01:30,325 --> 01:01:33,826
Hey, Flaps,
what we gonna do?

748
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:36,995
I don't know.
What you wanna do?

749
01:01:37,162 --> 01:01:39,871
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.

750
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,705
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene all right.

751
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:46,082
Ah, come off it.
Things are right dead all over.

752
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,750
You mean you wish they were.

753
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:53,460
Very funny.

754
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,212
Okay.
So what we gonna do?

755
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:01,422
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?

756
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,299
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"

757
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:06,299
Then you say, "I don't know.
What you wanna do?"

758
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:08,300
Then I say, "What we gonna do?"
You say, "What you wanna do?"

759
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:10,844
"What we gonna do?" "What you
want--" Let's do something!

760
01:02:11,011 --> 01:02:13,720
Okay. What you wanna do?

761
01:02:13,845 --> 01:02:17,846
Blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.

762
01:02:17,972 --> 01:02:21,598
I've got it! This time
I've really got it.

763
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:24,308
So you've got it.
Then what we gonna do?

764
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:28,726
Hold it, lads. Look.
Look what's coming our way.

765
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:31,728
Hey, what in the world
is that?

766
01:02:33,438 --> 01:02:35,772
What a crazy-looking
bunch of bones.

767
01:02:35,939 --> 01:02:38,857
Yeah, and they're all
walkin' about by themselves.

768
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:40,691
Yeah.

769
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:47,443
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

770
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:49,528
Hey, now don't
start that again!

771
01:02:49,695 --> 01:02:53,405
Come on, lads. Come on. Let's have
some fun with this little fella...

772
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,614
this little blokey.

773
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:10,204
Blimey. He's got legs
like a stork, he has.

774
01:03:10,372 --> 01:03:13,039
Like a stork. But he ain't
got no feathers, he ain't.

775
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:20,209
Go ahead. Laugh.
I don't care.

776
01:03:27,088 --> 01:03:30,798
- What's wrong with him?
- I think we overdid it.

777
01:03:30,923 --> 01:03:33,715
We were just having a bit
Of fun, that's all.

778
01:03:33,882 --> 01:03:37,050
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.

779
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:40,927
You know, he must be
down on his luck.

780
01:03:41,094 --> 01:03:43,803
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighbourhood.

781
01:03:45,429 --> 01:03:48,180
Hey, new kid,
wait a minute! Hey!

782
01:03:48,347 --> 01:03:52,557
-Just leave me alone.
- Oh, come on. What's wrong?

783
01:03:52,724 --> 01:03:55,433
You know, you look like you
haven't got a friend in the world.

784
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:59,018
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?

785
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:01,645
No.
Nobody wants me around.

786
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,562
Yeah, we know
how you feel.

787
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,897
Nobody wants us
around either.

788
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:10,399
Ah, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got heart.

789
01:04:10,524 --> 01:04:12,900
And feelings too.

790
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:17,068
And just to prove it to you, we're gonna
let you join our little group.

791
01:04:17,236 --> 01:04:21,321
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honouray vulture.

792
01:04:21,446 --> 01:04:24,530
Thanks, but I-- I'd rather
be on my own, alone.

793
01:04:25,573 --> 01:04:26,531
Aw, now look, kid.

794
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:29,575
Eveybody's got to have friends.

795
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,325
Hey, fellas,
are we his friends?

796
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,202
We'reyourfriends

797
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:38,370
We're your friends

798
01:04:38,537 --> 01:04:42,121
We're your friends
to the bitterend

799
01:04:42,247 --> 01:04:46,707
The bitterend

800
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:49,126
When you're alone

801
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:52,335
When you're alone

802
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:54,336
Who comes around

803
01:04:54,503 --> 01:04:57,337
Who comes around

804
01:04:57,463 --> 01:05:01,339
- To pluck you up
- To pluck you up
- Give us a smile.

805
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:03,423
When you are down

806
01:05:03,591 --> 01:05:08,801
When you are down

807
01:05:08,926 --> 01:05:12,010
And when you're
outside lookin' in

808
01:05:12,136 --> 01:05:18,013
- Who's there to open the door
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.

809
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:26,768
- That's what
- What friends are for

810
01:05:26,935 --> 01:05:30,686
Who's always eager to extend

811
01:05:30,812 --> 01:05:35,897
A friendly claw

812
01:05:36,022 --> 01:05:39,690
That's what friends are for

813
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:44,359
And when you're lost
in dire need

814
01:05:44,526 --> 01:05:48,444
Who's at your side
at lightning speed

815
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:52,071
We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike

816
01:05:52,196 --> 01:05:56,781
In fact we've never met
an animal we didn't like

817
01:05:56,907 --> 01:05:58,782
Ha-ha. You take it, kid.

818
01:05:58,908 --> 01:06:03,993
Didn't like

819
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:06,953
So you can see we're friends

820
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,954
- We're friends in need
- We're friends in need

821
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:10,955
-And friends in need
- Friends in need

822
01:06:11,122 --> 01:06:13,873
-Are friends indeed
-Are friends indeed

823
01:06:13,998 --> 01:06:15,998
- Whoop, whoop.
Take it easy, lads.
- We'll keep you safe

824
01:06:16,124 --> 01:06:18,708
- Steady, steady. Watch it!
- In the jungle

825
01:06:18,834 --> 01:06:24,378
Forevermore

826
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:30,088
That's what friends

827
01:06:30,214 --> 01:06:36,800
Are for

828
01:06:38,259 --> 01:06:40,551
Bravo, bravo.

829
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:43,303
An extraordinary performance.

830
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:46,137
And thank you for
detaining my victim.

831
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:48,388
Uh, do-don't mention it,
Your Highness.

832
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,975
- Boo.
- Let's get out of here.

833
01:06:55,101 --> 01:06:57,518
Give me room!
Gangway!

834
01:06:57,685 --> 01:06:59,560
Run, friend! Run!

835
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:02,812
Run? Why should I run?

836
01:07:02,938 --> 01:07:04,813
Why should you run?

837
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,148
Could it be possible that
you don't know who I am?

838
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:11,316
I know you, all right.
You're Shere Khan.

839
01:07:11,442 --> 01:07:14,318
Precisely.
Then you should also know...

840
01:07:14,443 --> 01:07:17,402
that everyone runs
from Shere Khan.

841
01:07:18,903 --> 01:07:22,821
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.

842
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:26,990
Ah. You have spirit
for one so small.

843
01:07:27,115 --> 01:07:30,908
And such spirit is deserving
Of a sporting chance.

844
01:07:31,076 --> 01:07:34,952
Now, I'm going to close my eyes
and count to ten.

845
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,786
It makes the chase
more interesting...

846
01:07:37,912 --> 01:07:39,787
for me.

847
01:07:39,913 --> 01:07:43,539
One, two...

848
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:46,041
three...

849
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:48,833
four--

850
01:07:49,668 --> 01:07:50,668
You're tying my patience.

851
01:07:50,835 --> 01:07:53,586
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten!

852
01:07:57,296 --> 01:07:59,505
Run, Mowgli. Run!

853
01:07:59,672 --> 01:08:02,673
Let go, you big oaf.

854
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,091
Take it easy. Take it--
Whoo! Ho-Hold it, hold it.

855
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:10,510
Whoa. Slow down. Ooh!
Yow! Whoa! Slow! Easy now.

856
01:08:10,677 --> 01:08:12,636
Ooh. Oh, boy. Easy.

857
01:08:12,762 --> 01:08:14,637
He's got a tiger
by the tail, he has.

858
01:08:14,804 --> 01:08:16,721
And he'd better
hang on too.

859
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:24,017
Take that, ya big bully.

860
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:27,185
Let him have it again, kid.
Hit him again, kid. Go on!

861
01:08:29,103 --> 01:08:31,687
Baloo! Help me!

862
01:08:44,735 --> 01:08:46,986
Somebody do somethin'
with that kid.

863
01:08:47,153 --> 01:08:49,112
Come on, lads.

864
01:08:52,989 --> 01:08:55,365
He's safe now.

865
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,532
You can let go, Baloo.

866
01:08:57,657 --> 01:09:01,367
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.

867
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:09,537
I'll kill you for this.

868
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:13,539
Let go!
Baloo needs help!

869
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:21,501
Fire! That's the only thing
old Stripes is afraid of.

870
01:09:21,627 --> 01:09:23,878
You get the fire.
We'll do the rest.

871
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:33,549
- Charge!
- You there, punch and blow.

872
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:36,300
Stay out of this,
you mangy fools.

873
01:09:36,467 --> 01:09:40,093
Yeah, yeah.
Missed me a mile, he did.

874
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,260
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Pull his blinkin' whiskers.

875
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:45,846
He's a bloomin' pussycat,
he is.

876
01:09:46,013 --> 01:09:48,805
Look behind you, chum.

877
01:10:06,648 --> 01:10:08,732
Well, that's
the last of him.

878
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,192
Old Stripes took off like
a flaming comet, he did.

879
01:10:13,317 --> 01:10:16,776
Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.

880
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:18,777
Hold it, fellas.

881
01:10:18,903 --> 01:10:20,737
Now's not the time for it.
Look.

882
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:30,324
Baloo?

883
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:42,080
Baloo, get up.
Oh, please get up.

884
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:57,254
Mowgli, try to understand.

885
01:10:57,421 --> 01:11:00,005
Bagheera, what's
the matter with him?

886
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:04,091
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.

887
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:06,883
You-- You don't mean--

888
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:10,510
Oh, no. Baloo.

889
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:17,680
Now, now.

890
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:20,306
I know how you feel.

891
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:23,682
But you must remember,
Mowgli...

892
01:11:24,892 --> 01:11:27,601
greater love
hath no one...

893
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:31,353
than he who lays down
his life for his friend.

894
01:11:32,896 --> 01:11:36,689
When great deeds are
remembered in this jungle...

895
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:41,107
one name will stand
above all others--

896
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:45,443
our friend, Baloo, the bear.

897
01:11:47,153 --> 01:11:50,154
- He's crackin' me up.
- The memory of Baloo's...

898
01:11:50,321 --> 01:11:52,155
sacrifice and bravey...

899
01:11:52,322 --> 01:11:56,740
will forever be engraved
on our saddened hearts.

900
01:11:56,865 --> 01:12:01,575
- Beautiful.
- This spot where Baloo fell...

901
01:12:01,743 --> 01:12:05,869
will always be a hallowed
place in the jungle...

902
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:08,828
for there lies
one of nature's...

903
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,830
noblest creatures.

904
01:12:13,748 --> 01:12:16,499
I wish my mother
could've heard this.

905
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,793
It's best we leave now.

906
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,294
Come along, man cub.

907
01:12:22,461 --> 01:12:25,295
Hey, don't stop now, Baghee.
You're doin' great!

908
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,796
There's more, lots more.

909
01:12:28,839 --> 01:12:31,465
Why, you big fraud!

910
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:33,507
You, you, you four-flusher!

911
01:12:33,632 --> 01:12:35,799
I-I'm fed up, and I-I--

912
01:12:35,967 --> 01:12:38,468
Baloo! You're all right!

913
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:42,761
Who, me? Sure I am.

914
01:12:42,887 --> 01:12:45,179
Never felt better.

915
01:12:49,348 --> 01:12:51,307
You sure had us worried.

916
01:12:51,432 --> 01:12:53,974
Ah, I was just takin' five.

917
01:12:54,142 --> 01:12:56,934
You know, playin' it cool.

918
01:12:57,102 --> 01:12:58,977
Yeah, but he was too easy.

919
01:12:59,144 --> 01:13:01,436
Good old Papa Bear.

920
01:13:01,562 --> 01:13:04,438
It's going to be a bit dull without
the little bloke, isn't it?

921
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:07,147
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

922
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:10,774
I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again!

923
01:13:11,942 --> 01:13:15,235
Hey, Baghee, too bad
you missed the action.

924
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,070
You should have seen how
I made a sucker out of old Stripes
with that left up in his face.

925
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:22,113
Boom, boom,
I was givin' him. Whang!

926
01:13:22,822 --> 01:13:24,947
You wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparrin' partners.

927
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:26,782
You'd better believe it.

928
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,741
Yes, sir.

929
01:13:28,825 --> 01:13:33,452
Nothin' or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.

930
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,953
My own home

931
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,622
My own home

932
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:45,457
My own home

933
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:49,458
My own home

934
01:13:50,543 --> 01:13:54,628
- Look. What's that?
- Oh, it's the man village.

935
01:13:54,753 --> 01:13:57,129
No, no. I mean that.

936
01:13:58,922 --> 01:14:03,424
Forget about those.
They ain't nothin' but trouble.

937
01:14:03,591 --> 01:14:06,467
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.

938
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:09,468
So you've seen one.
So let's go.

939
01:14:09,594 --> 01:14:12,970
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.

940
01:14:13,137 --> 01:14:16,138
- Mowgli, wait a minute.
- Ah, Baloo.

941
01:14:16,305 --> 01:14:18,139
Let him have
a better look.

942
01:14:26,476 --> 01:14:30,060
Father's hunting in the forest

943
01:14:30,186 --> 01:14:33,896
Mother's cooking in the home

944
01:14:34,063 --> 01:14:37,647
I must go to fetch the water

945
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:41,483
Till the day that I am grown

946
01:14:41,608 --> 01:14:45,318
Till I'm grown

947
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:48,986
Till I'm grown

948
01:14:49,112 --> 01:14:53,072
I must go to fetch the water

949
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:57,615
Till the day that I am grown

950
01:15:14,957 --> 01:15:19,292
Then I will have
a handsome husband

951
01:15:19,418 --> 01:15:22,461
And a daughter of my own

952
01:15:22,586 --> 01:15:26,462
And I'll send her
to fetch the water

953
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:30,881
I'll be cooking in the home

954
01:15:37,759 --> 01:15:42,052
Then I'll send her
to fetch the water

955
01:15:42,178 --> 01:15:45,929
I'll be cooking in my home

956
01:15:52,475 --> 01:15:55,226
She did that on purpose.

957
01:15:55,393 --> 01:15:57,227
Obviously.

958
01:16:30,826 --> 01:16:34,869
Mowgli, come back.
Come back!

959
01:16:35,036 --> 01:16:37,287
Go on! Go on!

960
01:17:01,715 --> 01:17:03,340
He's hooked.

961
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:06,758
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.

962
01:17:06,926 --> 01:17:10,761
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.

963
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:13,137
Mowgli is where
he belongs now.

964
01:17:14,971 --> 01:17:16,846
Yeah...

965
01:17:16,972 --> 01:17:19,389
I guess you're right.

966
01:17:19,557 --> 01:17:23,350
But I still think he'd
have made one swell bear.

967
01:17:25,643 --> 01:17:27,852
Well, come on,
Baghee buddy.

968
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,103
Let's get back
to where we belong...

969
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,771
and get with the beat.

970
01:17:32,938 --> 01:17:35,730
Look for the bare necessities

971
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:37,981
The simple bare necessities

972
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:42,067
Forget about your worries
And your strife

973
01:17:42,192 --> 01:17:44,901
I mean the bare necessities

974
01:17:44,985 --> 01:17:47,194
Are Mother Nature's recipes

975
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,696
That bring the bare
necessities of life
