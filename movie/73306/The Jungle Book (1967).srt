1
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:40,368
Many strange legends are told of these jungles of India,

2
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:45,081
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.

3
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,254
It all began when the silence of the jungle was broken

4
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,839
by an unfamiliar sound.

5
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,013
It was a sound like one never heard before

6
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,932
in this part of the jungle.

7
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,023
It was a man cub!

8
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,318
Had I known how deeply I was to be involved,

9
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,530
I would've obeyed my first impulse and walked away.

10
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,627
This man cub would have to have nourishment, and soon.

11
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,755
It was many days' travel
to the nearest man-village,

12
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,884
and without a mother's care, he would soon perish.

13
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,303
Then it occurred to me.

14
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:46,976
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed with a litter of cubs.

15
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,541
I knew there'd be no problem with the
mother, thanks to the maternal instinct,

16
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,963
but I wasn't so sure about Rama, the father.

17
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,914
Ten times, the rains had come and gone,

18
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,332
and I often stopped by

19
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,419
to see how Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.

20
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,839
He was a favourite with all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.

21
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,440
No man cub was ever happier.

22
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,694
And yet, I knew that someday

23
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,572
he would have to go back to his own kind.

24
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,788
Then one night, the wolf pack elders met at Council Rock

25
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,333
because Shere Khan, the tiger,

26
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,836
had returned to their part of the jungle.

27
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,674
This meeting was to change the man cub's entire future.

28
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,471
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.

29
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,017
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?

30
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,938
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.

31
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,984
Rama. Come over here, please.

32
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,778
Yes, Akela?

33
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,946
The council has reached its decision.

34
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,033
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.

35
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,494
He must leave at once.

36
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,787
"Leave"?

37
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,165
I'm sorry, Rama. There is no other way.

38
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,627
But the man cub is...

39
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,504
Well, he's like my own son.

40
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,131
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.

41
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:09,011
But, Rama, even the strength of
the pack is no match for the tiger.

42
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,431
But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.

43
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,309
Akela, perhaps I can be of help.

44
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,896
You, Bagheera? How?

45
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,899
I know of a man-village
where he'll be safe.

46
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,445
Mowgli and I have taken many walks
into the jungle together.

47
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,030
I'm sure he'll go with me.

48
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,242
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.

49
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,702
Good luck.

50
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,636
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.

51
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,513
Shouldn't we start back home?

52
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,767
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.

53
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,063
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?

54
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,067
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle

55
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,445
and he has sworn to kill you.

56
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,824
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?

57
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,409
He hates man.

58
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,580
Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man,

59
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,790
just another hunter with a gun.

60
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,003
We'll just explain to him
that I'd never do a thing like that.

61
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,631
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.

62
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,177
Well, maybe so, but I'm not afraid.

63
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,596
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.

64
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,015
We'll spend the night here.

65
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,975
Things will look better in the morning.

66
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,561
Man Cub?

67
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,938
Man Cub!

68
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,568
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.

69
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,531
I don't wanna go back
to the man-village.

70
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,741
Go on. Up you go.

71
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,536
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.

72
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,293
Is that all the better you can climb?

73
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,670
It's too big around.

74
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,299
And besides, I don't have any claws.

75
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,777
Now get some sleep.

76
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,198
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.

77
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,574
I wanna stay in the jungle.

78
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,286
You wouldn't last one day.

79
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,958
I'm not afraid.

80
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,252
I can look out for myself.

81
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,179
Say, now.

82
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,140
What have we here?

83
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,686
It's a man cub.

84
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,107
A delicious man cub.

85
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,526
Go away and leave me alone.

86
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,488
That's just what I should do, but I'm not.

87
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,534
Now, please go to sleep, Man Cub.

88
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,205

Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!

My sinus.

100

You have just made a serious mistake, my friend,

101
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,138
a very stupid...

102

...mistake.

Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.

105
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,688
No, please, Kaa...

106
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,441
Both eyes, if you please.

107
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:40,074
You have just sealed your doom.

108

Look, Bagheera.

109
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,126
Look. Bagheera. Wake up, Bagheera.

00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,463
Wha...

111
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:00,135
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.

112

Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!

113
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,934
"He's got a knot in his tail."

114
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,903
This is going to slow down my slithering.

115
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,869
So, you can look out for yourself, can you?

116
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,831
So, you want to stay in the jungle, do you?

164
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,033
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.

165
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,208
Let's have a little more spit and polish
on those bayonets.

166
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,543
Yes, sir.

167
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,378
Esprit de corps.

168
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,130
That's the way I earned my commission

169
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,382
in the Maharajah's Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.

170
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,094
Back in '88, it was... Or... Or was it?

171
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,182
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.

172
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,810
It was then I received the Victoria Cross,

173
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,730
for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.

174
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,692
Those were the days.

175
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,403
Discipline! Discipline was the thing.

176
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,074
Builds character and that sort of thing, you know.

177
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,828
Where was I?

178
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,414
Yes. Inspection.

179
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,042
Well, very good.

180
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,588
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.

181
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,219
Eyes front.

182
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,349
Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.

183
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,434
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?

184
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,812
There. That's better.

185
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,773
And as for you...

186
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,109
There you are.

187
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,239
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?

188
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,449
Okay, Pop.

189
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,411
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.

190
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,622
Well, a new recruit, eh?

191
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,918
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!

192
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,671
Stop that!

193
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,883
A man cub! This is treason! Sabotage!

194
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,719
I'll have no man cub in my jungle!

195
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,347
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!

196
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,433
I can explain, Hathi.

197
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,436
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.

198
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,105
Yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.

199
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,818
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.

200
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,488
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.

201
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,198
Good.

202
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,327
And remember, an elephant never forgets.

203
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,583
I don't know what the army's coming to these days.

204
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,377
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?

205
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,922
Let's get on with it!

206
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,382
Right face!

207
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,427
Forward march!

208
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,646
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?

209
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,857
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.

210
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,942
An elephant never forgets.

211
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,654
Well, you just forgot our son.

212
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,783
Our... Son? Son!

213
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,202
Yes, yes, yes. Quite right.

214
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,370
To the rear, march!

215
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,670
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...

216
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,049
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times...

217
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,551
Pop! Look out!

218
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,818
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."

219
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,197
He said an elephant never forgets.

220
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,453
It's not funny.

221
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,414
Let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.

222
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,089
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?

223
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,343
You're going back
to the man-village right now.

224
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,679
I'm not going.

225
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,307
- Yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.

226
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,395
You're going, if I have to
drag you every step of the way.

227
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,232
Let go, you...

228
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,442
You let go of me!

229
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,745
That does it.

230
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,456
I've had it, Man Cub.

231
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,002
From now on, you're on your own...

232
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,254
Alone!

233
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,256
Don't worry about me.

234
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,997
Foolish man cub.

Hey!

244
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,097
What a funny little bit of a...

245
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,265
Go away!

246
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,478
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.

247
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,480
What have I run on?

248
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,233
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.

249
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:03,738
Well, now, that's pretty big talk, Little Britches.

250
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,573
I'm big enough.

251
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,994
Pitiful.

252
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,871
Hey, kid, you need help

253
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,209
and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.

254
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,545
Come on. I'm gonna show ya.

255
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,299
Yeah!

256
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,511
All right, now, kid, loosen up.

257
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,848
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.

258
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,016
That's it.

259
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,019
Now give me a big bear growl.
Scare me.

260
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,107
Oh, boy.

261
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,902
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.

262
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,369
He's in trouble.
I shouldn't have left him alone.

263
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,296
- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that?

264
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,887
You're gettin' it, kid.

265
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,432
Oh, no! It's Baloo!

266
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,477
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.

267
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,979
Weave about now. Look for an opening.

268
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,523
Keep movin'. Keep...

269
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,943
You're gettin' it, kid. Come on! That's it!

270
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,197
He's a dandy!

271
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:34,204
Fine teacher you are, OI' Iron Paws.

272
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,539
Thanks, Bagheera.

273
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:41,211
Tell me, tell me, after you knock your pupil senseless,

274
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,505
how do you expect him to remember the lesson?

275
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,381
Well, I... I...

276
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,344
Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.

277
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,888
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.

278
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,682
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.

279
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,518
You better believe it.

280
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,436
Now, let's go once more.

281
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:01,648
I want you to keep circlin', or
I'm gonna knock your roof in again.

282
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,608
You'd better keep movin'...

283
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,528
Hey! Right on the button.

284
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,956
No. No, no. No, no. Now you're ticklin'.

285
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:24,003
No. No, now, we don't do that
here in the... No!

286
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,423
No, you're ticklin'.
I can't stand that ticklin'.

287
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,552
Help! Bagheera!

288
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,388
Oh, boy.
That's all he needs, more confidence.

289
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,224
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!

290
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,184
I give...

291
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,479
Hey!

292
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,440
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.

293
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,608
What do they call you?

294
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,154
Mowgli, and he's going back
to the man-village right now.

295
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,700
Man-village? They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.

296
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,744
Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.

297
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,079
Certainly, you do.

298
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,709
And just how do you think he will survive?

299
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,170
"How do you think..."

300
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,380
What do you mean, how do you think he...

301
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,050
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.

302
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,012
That shouldn't take too long.

303
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,267
Look, now, it's like this, Little Britches.

304
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,228
All you gotta do is...

305
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,732

And furthermore, Baloo,

Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble,

and your influence hasn't been exactly...

Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes?

to have a word with you.

Baloo, the man cub
must go back to the man-village.

The jungle is not the place for him.

547
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,295
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.

548
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,798
Yes, just look at yourself.

549
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,092
Look at that eye.

550
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,219

Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.

553
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,562
Well, you don't look exactly
like a basket of fruit yourself.

554
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:31,864
Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.

555
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,198
Why not?

556
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,785
How can I put it?

557
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,583
Baloo, birds of a feather should flock together.

558
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,878
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?

559
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,629
I don't know.

560
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,466
Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.

561
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,971
Baloo, you've got to be serious about this.

562
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,057
Stop worryin', Baggy. Stop worryin'.

563
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,559
I'll take care of him.

564
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,896
Yes, like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?

565
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,024
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.

566
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:13,697
And another thing, sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.

567
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,784
The tiger?
What's he got against the kid?

568
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,622
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.

569
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,708
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.

570
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,045
But little Mowgli don't have those things.

571
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,672
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.

572
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,259
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.

573
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,345
Just one swipe and...

574
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,474
Well, what are we gonna do?

575
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:42,809
We'll do what's best for the boy.

576
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,020
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.

577
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,107
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man-village.

578
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,734
Are you out of your mind?

579
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,654
I promised him he could stay here in the jungle with me.

580
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,489
That's just the point.

581
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,533
As long as he remains with you, he's in danger.

582
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,119
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?

583
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,830
Because he won't listen to me.

584
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,918
I love that kid.

585
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,003
I love him like he was my own cub.

586
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,257
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.

587
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:17,344
Well, can't I wait until morning?

588
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,346
It's morning now.

589
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,350

590
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,540

00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,836
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.

631
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,588
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?

632
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:02,426
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin' all morning to tell ya,

633
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,512
I've got to take you back
to the man-village.

634
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,015
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.

635
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,018
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...

636
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:16,022
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!

637
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,024
That's goin' too far!

638
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,028
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?

639
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,866
Wait a minute! Stop!

640
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,243
Wait!

641
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,580
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!

642
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,973
Mowgli!

643
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,966
Mowgli. Mowgli!

644
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,594
Now what's happened?

645
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,555
Well, you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera,

646
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,559
but look, now, I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me!

647
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,853
Well, don't just stand there.

648
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,939
Let's separate. We've got to find him!

649
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,736
If anything happens to that little guy,
I'll never forgive myself.

650
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,863
I gotta find him.

651
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,534

Wait a minute. Halt!

670
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:58,476
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.

671
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,396
Well, speak up. Who was it?

672
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,814
It was me, Colonel.

673
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,276
What do you mean, sir, taking over my command?

674
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,360
Highly irregular, you know.

675
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,530
Colonel, I'm sorry, but I need your help.

676
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,074
Absolutely impossible.

677
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,784
We're on a cross-country march.

678
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,745
But it's an emergency, Colonel.

679
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,789
- The man cub must be found.
- Man cub? What man cub?

680
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,375
How interesting.

681
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,503
The one I was taking to the man-village.

682
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,298
Good. That's where he belongs.

683
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:32,010
Now, sir, if you don't mind,
we'd like to get on with the march.

684
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,972
No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.

685
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,309
He is lost. He ran away.

686
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,394
How delightful.

687
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,023
Well, it serves the young whippersnapper right.

688
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,984
But Shere Khan, the tiger,

689
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,862
is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.

690
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,408
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.

691
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,495
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here.

692
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,458
Sorry, Bagheera.

693
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,794
Fortunes of war and all that sort of thing, you know.

694
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,922
This has gone far enough.

695
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,382
Far enough!

696
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,761
Now, just a minute, you pompous old windbag!

697
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,972
Winifred!
What are you doing out of ranks?

698
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,058
Never mind.

699
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:25,105
How would you like to have our boy
lost and alone in the jungle?

700
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,607
Our son, alone?

701
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:32,153
But, Winifred, old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.

702
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,114
Different, entirely.

703
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,243
That little boy is no different than our own son.

704
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,122
Now you help find him or I'm taking over command.

705
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,250
What? A female leading my herd?

706
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,960
Utterly preposterous.

707
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,380
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.

708
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,549
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.

709
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,927
Please, Pop, sir? Please?

710
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,596
Now, don't you worry, son.

711
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,268
Your father had a plan in mind all the time.

712
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,522
Sure you did.

713
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,234
Troopers!

714
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,487
Company, left face!

715
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:20,493
Volunteers for a special mission
will step one pace forward.

716
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:35,425
That's what I like to see.

717
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,177
Devotion to duty.

718
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:42,766
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub.

719
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,602
Thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.

720
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,520
Yes. Yes.

721
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:51,024
Bugler, when the man cub is sighted,

722
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,986
you will sound your trumpet three times.

723
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,237
Yes, sir.

724
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,450
Not now, soldier.

725
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,786
Sorry, sir.

726
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,706
Lieutenant, our strategy
shall be the element of surprise.

727
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:12,629
You will take one squad and cover the right flank.

728
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:13,838
Yes, sir.

729
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:17,926
And I shall meet the other squad on the left flank.

730
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,178
Very well.

731
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,055
Company...

732
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,018
Forward march!

733
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,072
Element of surprise?

734
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,407
I say.

735
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:48,748
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub.

736
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,004
Kaa! It's you!

737
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,299
Yes, Man Cub.

738
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,177
So nice to see you again.

739
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,015
Go away. Leave me alone.

740
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,019
Let me look at you.

741
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,315
You don't want me to look at you?

742
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,652
Then you look at me.

743
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,322
No, sir.
I know what you're trying to do, Kaa.

744
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,949
You do?

745
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:49,035
I mean, you don't trust me.

746
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,039
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.

747
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,042
You want to help me?

748
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,877
Certainly.

749
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,800
I can see to it that you never have to leave this jungle.

750
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,094
How could you do that?

751
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,515
I have my own

752
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:14,435
subtle little ways.

753
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,565
But first, you must trust me.

754
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,236
I don't trust anyone any more.

755
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,698
I don't blame you.

756
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:32,620
I'm not like those so-called
fair-weather friends of yours.

757
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:36,165

I'll be right down.

779
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,598
Yes? Yes? Who is it?

780
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,975
It's me, Shere Khan.

781
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,104
I'd like a word with you, if you don't mind.

782
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,147
Shere Khan.

783
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,192
What a surprise.

784
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:30,196
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.

785
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,990
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

786
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,076
No, no. Nothing at all.

787
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:39,413
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.

788
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,791
Coils? Someone? No.

789
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,962
I was just curling up for my siesta.

790
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,713
But you were singing to someone.

791
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,968
- Who is it, Kaa?
- Who?

792
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,678
No.

793
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:57,974
I was just singing to myself.

794
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,058
Indeed.

795
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,230
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my sinuses.

796
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:08,442
- What a pity.
- You have no idea.

797
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,238
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.

798
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:17,243
I can't sleep, so I sing myself to sleep.

799
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,788
You know, self-hypnosis?

800
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,417
Let me show you how it works.

801
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,088
♪ <i>Trust in me</i> ♪

802
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,844
I can't be bothered with that.
I have no time for that sort of nonsense.

803
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,681
- Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.

804
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,018
But at the moment I am searching for a man cub.

805
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,145
"Man cub"? What man cub?

806
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,480
The one who's lost.

807
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,108
Now, where do you suppose he could be?

808
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,235
Search me.

809
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,946
That's an excellent idea.

810
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:57,325
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?

811
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,994
Certainly not.

812
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:06,209
Nothing here, and nothing in here.

813
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,343
My sinuses.

814
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,347
Indeed.

815
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,975
And now, how about the middle?

816
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,061
The middle?

817
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,730
The middle.

818
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,363
Absolutely nothing in the middle.

819
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,909
Really?

820
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,247
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub,

821
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,166
you will inform me first.

822
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:52,004
- Understand?
- I get the point.

823
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,633
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.

824
00:59:56,843 --> 01:00:00,680
And I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.

825
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,935
Who does he think he's fooling?

826
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,770
"Helpless little lad."

827
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,524
He gives me the shivers.

828
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:18,322
Picking on that poor little helpless boy.

829
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,951
Yes.

830
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,620
The poor little helpless boy.

831
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,924
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.

832
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,885
It's like you said.

833
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:43,556
You can't trust anyone.

834
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:53,399
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again,

835
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,234
it will be too soon.

836
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,907
My sacroiliac.

837
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,554
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?

838
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,390
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

839
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,478
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.

840
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:33,105
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene.

841
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:36,442
Come off it!
Things are right dead all over.

842
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,153
You mean you wish they were.

843
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,240
Very funny.

844
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,620
Okay, so what we gonna do?

845
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,374
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

846
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:55,044
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"

847
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,004
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"

848
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:58,964
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"

849
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,133
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!

850
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,803
Okay. What do you want to do?

851
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:07,973
Blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.

852
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,977
I've got it! This time, I've really got it.

853
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,022
So you've got it. So what we gonna do?

854
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:19,151
Hold it, lads. Look.
Look what's coming our way.

855
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,529
Hey, what in the world is that?

856
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,158
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.

857
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:29,161
Yeah, and they're all walking about by themselves.

858
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,878
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

859
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:39,922
Hey, now, don't start that again.

860
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,590
Come on, lads. Come on.

861
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:45,052
Let's have some fun with this
little fella, this Little Bloke, eh?

862
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,651
Blimey!
He's got legs like a stork, he has.

863
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,571
Like a stork.
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.

864
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,578
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.

865
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,211
What's wrong with him?

866
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,671
I think we overdid it.

867
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,549
We were just having a bit of fun, that's all.

868
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:27,553
Just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.

869
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,598
You know, he must be down on his luck.

870
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,226
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood.

871
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,230
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!

872
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,483
Just leave me alone.

873
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,985
Come on. What's wrong?

874
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,905
You look like you haven't got a friend in the world.

875
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,450
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?

876
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,619
No. Nobody wants me around.

877
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,455
Yeah. We know how you feel.

878
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,874
Nobody wants us around either.

879
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:00,252
We may look a bit shabby, but we've got hearts.

880
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,588
And feelings, too.

881
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:07,259
And just to prove it to you, we're
going to let you join our little group.

882
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:11,388
Kid, we'd like to make you an honorary vulture.

883
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,683
Thanks, but I'd rather be on my own alone.

884
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:17,019
Now, look, kid.

885
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,146
Everybody's got to have friends.

886
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,608

An extraordinary performance.

And thank you for detaining my victim.

924
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,662
Don't mention it, Your Highness.

925
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,835
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room! Gangway!

926
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,713
Run, friend! Run!

927
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,633
"Run"? Why should I run?

928
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,302
Why should you run?

929
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:58,681
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am?

930
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,391
I know you, all right.

931
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:03,185
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.

932
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:07,815
Then you should also know
that everyone runs from Shere Khan.

933
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:12,569
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.

934
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,074
You have spirit for one so small,

935
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,452
and such spirit is deserving of a sporting chance.

936
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,915
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten.

937
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:29,420
It makes the chase
more interesting... For me.

938
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,463
One,

939
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,758
two, three,

940
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,386
four...

941
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,181
You're trying my patience.

942
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,143
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

943
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,481
Run, Mowgli, run!

944
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,776
Let go, you big oaf!

945
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,487
Take it easy. Take it easy.

946
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,489
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

947
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,617
Slow! Easy, now!

948
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,203
Easy!

949
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:05,164
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.

950
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,624
And he better hang on, too.

951
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,881
Take that, you big bully.

952
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:17,760
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid! Go on!

953
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,181
Baloo! Help me!

954
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,613
Somebody do something with that kid!

955
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,198
Come on, lads!

956
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:47,706
He's safe now! You can let go, Baloo.

957
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,210
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.

958
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,553
I'll kill you for this.

959
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,139
Let go! Baloo needs help!

960
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:12,189
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.

961
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,233
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.

962
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,533
Charge!

963
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,912
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!

964
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,665
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!

965
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,253
Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!

966
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,463
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!

967
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,465
Look behind you, chum.

968
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,319
Well, that's the last of him.

969
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:03,866
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did.

970
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,493
Well, come on.
Let's go congratulate our friend.

971
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,288
Hold it, fellas.

972
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,541
Now is not the time for it. Look.

973
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,549
Baloo?

974
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,350
Baloo, get up.

975
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,145
Please, get up.

976
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,534
Mowgli, try to understand.

977
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,829
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?

978
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:54,207
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was.

979
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,169
You... You don't mean...

980
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,464
No. Baloo.

981
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,182
Now, now. I know how you feel.

982
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,686
But you must remember, Mowgli,

983
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,607
"Greater love hath no one

984
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,152
"than he who lays down his life
for his friend."

985
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,113
When great deeds

986
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,449
are remembered in this jungle,

987
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:31,286
one name will stand above all others.

988
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:36,458
Our friend, Baloo the bear.

989
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,378
He's crackin' me up.

990
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:42,798
The memory of Baloo's sacrifice and bravery

991
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:47,052
will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts.

992
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,096
Beautiful.

993
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:55,852
This spot where Baloo fell will always
be a hallowed place in the jungle,

994
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:01,191
for there lies one of nature's noblest creatures.

995
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,239
I wish my mother could have heard this.

996
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,741
It's best we leave now.

997
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,035
Come along, Man Cub.

998
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:16,081
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!

999
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,709
There's more. Lots more!

1000
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,671
Why, you big fraud!

1001
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,381
You four-flusher!

1002
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:26,633
I'm fed up!

1003
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,387
Baloo, you're all right!

1004
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,765
Who, me? Sure I am.

1005
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,934
Never felt... Better.

1006
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:44,901
- You sure had us worried.
- I was just takin' five.

1007
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,362
You know, playin' it cool.

1008
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:51,408
- But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.

1009
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:55,162
It's going to be a bit dull
without the Little Bloke, isn't it?

1010
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,956
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

1011
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,543
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!

1012
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,131
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.

1013
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,674
You should have seen how I made a sucker

1014
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:10,135
out of Old Stripes with that left up in his face.

1015
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,929
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him.
"Wham!"

1016
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,724
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.

1017
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:19,227
- You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.

1018
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:24,024
Nothing or nobody is ever gonna come between us again.
