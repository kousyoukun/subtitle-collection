
1
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,800
片名:森林王子

2
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:40,368
Many strange legends are told of these jungles of India,
印度丛林故事 总是充满神秘的色彩

3
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:45,081
but none so strange as the story of a small boy named Mowgli.
其中又以毛克利的故事最是

4
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,254
It all began when the silence of the jungle was broken
记得那一天安静的森林

5
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,839
by an unfamiliar sound.
突然传来一种陌生的声音

6
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,013
It was a sound like one never heard before
这个声音 可以说是我从来没听过的

7
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,932
in this part of the jungle.

8
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,023
It was a man cub!
是……是人类的一个小家伙！

9
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,318
Had I known how deeply I was to be involved,
哦，我的直觉告诉我少管闲事

10
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,530
I would've obeyed my first impulse and walked away.
但是 我还是忍不住管了闲事

11
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,627
This man cub would have to have nourishment, and soon.
这孩子这么小

12
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,755
It was many days' travel to the nearest man-village,
离人类的村落又那么远

13
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,884
and without a mother's care, he would soon perish.
没有妈妈的照顾 他绝对活不了多久

14
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,303
Then it occurred to me.

15
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,090
呃，对了

16
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:46,976
A family of wolves I knew had been blessed with a litter of cubs.
前不久野狼家 才生了一窝小宝宝

17
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,541
I knew there'd be no problem with the mother, thanks to the maternal instinct,
大自然创造的母性 就是这么纯朴实在

18
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,963
but I wasn't so sure about Rama, the father.
不过，我还是有点担心 爸爸阿利的表现

19
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,914
Ten times, the rains had come and gone,
十几个寒暑一转眼就过去了

20
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,332
and I often stopped by
我经常去看毛克利

21
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,419
to see how Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.

22
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,839
He was a favourite with all the young wolf cubs of the pack.
那个小家伙长得还真好

23
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,440
No man cub was ever happier.
小野狼都很喜欢他

24
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,694
And yet, I knew that someday
不过，我知道只要时候到了

25
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,572
he would have to go back to his own kind.
他就得回到他的村落

26
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,788
Then one night, the wolf pack elders met at Council Rock
一个晚上野狼族聚在一起 开了岩石大会

27
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,333
because Shere Khan, the tiger,
原来是老虎谢利 回到了森林

28
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,836
had returned to their part of the jungle.

29
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,674
This meeting was to change the man cub's entire future.
这个会议改变了 小家伙的后半生

30
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,471
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.
谢利会杀了小家伙 连我们也很危险

31
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,017
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?
现在我们必须同意这个选择

32
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,938
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.
虽然是很难启口 我还是得告诉阿利

33
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,984
Rama. Come over here, please.
阿利，麻烦你过来一下

34
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,778
Yes, Akela?
什么事啊？阿格拉

35
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,946
The council has reached its decision.
大会做出了一致的决定

36
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,033
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.
那个小家伙不能 住在我们这里

37
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,494
He must leave at once.
他必须立刻离开这里

38
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,787
"Leave"?
为什么？

39
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,165
I'm sorry, Rama. There is no other way.
对不起，阿利 我们也没有办法

40
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,627
But the man cub is...
可是……可是这个小家伙

41
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,504
Well, he's like my own son.
就像我亲生的儿子

42
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,131
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.
不管怎么说 我们应该一起保护他呀

43
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:09,011
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.
阿利，全野狼族加起来 也打不过谢利啊

44
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,431
But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.
小家伙一个人在丛林里 怎么过呢

45
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,309
Akela, perhaps I can be of help.
阿格拉，交给我吧

46
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,896
You, Bagheera? How?
你，巴希拉？能吗？

47
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,899
I know of a man-village where he'll be safe.
他最好回到人类的村落

48
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,445
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together.
毛克利常常跟我一起 在森林里散步

49
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,030
I'm sure he'll go with me.
他会跟我走的

50
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,242
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.
那也好，就别再浪费时间了

51
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,702
Good luck.
快点上路

52
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,636
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.
巴希拉，我好困啊

53
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,513
Shouldn't we start back home?
我们回家吧

54
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,767
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.
毛克利 从今天起我们不回家了

55
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,063
- I'm taking you to a man-village. - But why?
我要送你去人类的村落 为什么？

56
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,067
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle
因为谢利 他又回到森林来称霸

57
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,445
and he has sworn to kill you.
而且他一定会吃了你

58
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,824
Kill me? But why would he want to do that?
吃了我？ 为什么要吃我啊？

59
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,409
He hates man.
他恨人类

60
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,580
Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man,
谢利绝不会让你 在这个地方长大成人的

61
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,790
just another hunter with a gun.
他说人只会举枪杀老虎

62
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,003
We'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.
哦，那我可以解释给他听 我不是那种人啊

63
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,631
Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan.
开玩笑 跟谢利是有理说不清的

64
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,177
Well, maybe so, but I'm not afraid.
那就算了，反正我也不怕他

65
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,596
- And besides, I... - Now, that's enough.
呃，再说…… 好了，别说了

66
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,015
We'll spend the night here.
今天咱们在这过夜

67
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,975
Things will look better in the morning.
明天天一亮就没事了

68
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,561
Man Cub?
小家伙？

69
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,938
Man Cub!
小家伙！

70
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,568
Now, come on. Up this tree. It's safer up there.
爬上去，到树上去 上面安全

71
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,531
I don't wanna go back to the man-village.
呃，可是我不想去人类的村落

72
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,741
Go on. Up you go.
来吧！上去

73
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,536
- That limb way up there? - That's right.
要爬那么高啊？ 是啊

74
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,293
Is that all the better you can climb?
爬树哪是这样爬的？

75
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,670
It's too big around.
树干太大了嘛

76
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,299
And besides, I don't have any claws.
再说，我又没有你的爪子

77
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,777
Now get some sleep.
好了，早点睡吧

78
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,198
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.
我们明天一早要赶路呢

79
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,574
I wanna stay in the jungle.
呃，我要留在森林里

80
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,710
嗯，哈……多留一天也不行

81
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,286
You wouldn't last one day.

82
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,958
I'm not afraid.
我才不怕 我会自己照顾自己的

83
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,252
I can look out for myself.

84
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,179
Say, now.
瞧瞧

85
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,140
What have we here?
谁在这儿呀？

86
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,686
It's a man cub.

Go away and leave me alone.
哦，走开，不要吵我

That's just what I should do, but I'm not.
哦……我也不想吵你 可是你一个人谁放心得下

Now, please go to sleep, Man Cub.

Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble,
毛克利跟人类一样 会闹得天下大乱

564
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,231
A disgraceful performance.
是啊，虽然也不见得有多好

565

Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes?

Baloo, the man cub must go back to the man-village.
巴鲁

575

小家伙必须要回到 人类的村落才行

576
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,707
The jungle is not the place for him.
森林不是人呆的地方

I grew up in the jungle. Take a look at me.
我是这儿长大的 不也挺好的嘛

Look at that eye.
你看看你的眼睛

It's beautiful, ain't it?
多美的眼睛啊

582
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,516
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.
我直说吧，你可是声名狼藉

583
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,562
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket of fruit yourself.
话说回来 你也不见得过的有声有色啊

584
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:31,864
Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.
巴鲁

585
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,270
你总不能一辈子养着毛克利嘛

586
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,198
Why not?
为什么？

587
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,785
How can I put it?
天……该怎么说你才听得懂？

588
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,583
Baloo, birds of a feather should flock together.
巴鲁

589
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,770
小鸟得跟小鸟生活

590
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,878
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?
你总不能娶黑豹吧？

591
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,629
I don't know.
我不知道

592
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,466
Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.
哈……问题是也没有黑豹 跟我求过婚呢

593
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,971
Baloo, you've got to be serious about this.
巴鲁 你可不可以认真一点

594
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,057
Stop worryin', Baggy. Stop worryin'.
哎哟，别担心嘛，老巴 别担心

595
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,559
I'll take care of him.
这事儿我来想法子

596
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,896
Yes, like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?
嗯，又来了 就像小家伙给猴子抓去一样

597
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,024
- Can't a guy make one mistake? - Not in the jungle.
犯一次错都不行啊？ 森林里就是不行

598
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:13,697
And another thing, sooner or later Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.
还有啊

599
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,070
我敢说谢利很快就会 找到毛克利

600
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,784
The tiger? What's he got against the kid?
那只老虎？ 他又有什么不满意啊？

601
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,622
He hates man with a vengeance. You know that.
他最恨人类了 你又不是不知道

602
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,708
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.
他最怕人类的枪跟火

603
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,045
But little Mowgli don't have those things.
可是小毛克利 又没有那些东西

604
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,672
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.
谢利就是怕小家伙长大

605
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,259
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.
学会了那些东西 所以他就要趁他还小

606
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,345
Just one swipe and...
就一爪子……

607
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,474
Well, what are we gonna do?
那……那我们该怎么办？

608
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:42,809
We'll do what's best for the boy.
我们得替小家伙想

609
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,020
You better believe it. You name it, and I'll do it.
你放心 你说什么我都做

610
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,107
Good. Then make Mowgli go to the man-village.
好，要毛克利回到 人类的村落去

611
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,734
Are you out of your mind?
你胡说什么？

612
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,654
I promised him he could stay here in the jungle with me.
我答应过毛克利 可以跟我留在这儿的

613
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,489
That's just the point.
你想想清楚耶

614
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,533
As long as he remains with you, he's in danger.
他留在这里跟着你 那有多危险

615
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,119
- So it's up to you. - Why me?
你自己决定 为什么要我？

616
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,830
Because he won't listen to me.
因……因为他已经不理我了

617
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,918
I love that kid.

I love him like he was my own cub.
我觉得他就像我亲生儿子

619
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,257
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.
多替毛克利想想 不要只为你自己

620
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:17,344
Well, can't I wait until morning?
那……我……

621
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,670

Wait a minute! Stop!

678
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,243
Wait!
嘿！

Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!

Mowgli. Mowgli!
毛克利！

684
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,594
Now what's happened?
巴鲁啊，又怎么了？

685
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,555
Well, you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera,
巴希拉，我想我弄砸了

686
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,559
but look, now, I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me!
我也是依样画葫芦 把你告诉我的说给他听

687
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,853
Well, don't just stand there.
他就跑了！

688
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,220
那……那你还站在这里 干什么？

689
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,939
Let's separate. We've got to find him!
分头找！快去把他找回来！

690
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,736
If anything happens to that little guy, I'll never forgive myself.
哎！要是他有什么三长两短 我这一辈子……

691
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,863
I gotta find him.

00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,862
is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.

Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.

Sorry, Bagheera.
哦，很抱歉，巴希拉 其实生存也是要靠点运气

738
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,794
Fortunes of war and all that sort of thing, you know.

739
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,922
This has gone far enough.
真是越说越不像话

740
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,382
Far enough!
我实在受不了！

Now, just a minute, you pompous old windbag!
听好 你这个自以为是的老家伙！

742
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,972
Winifred! What are you doing out of ranks?
温妮！是谁准许你 出列了？

743
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,058
Never mind.
我自己

How would you like to have our boy lost and alone in the jungle?
我问你，要是今天走丢的是 咱们的儿子，你会怎么样？

Our son, alone?
我们的儿子……走丢了？

746
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:32,153
But, Winifred, old girl, that's an entirely different matter.
温妮，你怎么能这样比呢？ 这根本是两码事儿嘛

747
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,114
Different, entirely.
哼 哼什么哼啊，温妮

748
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,243
That little boy is no different than our own son.
那个小家伙跟我们的儿子一样

749
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,122
Now you help find him or I'm taking over command.
要是你不肯帮忙的话 以后我来当领队

750
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,250
What? A female leading my herd?
什么？女人来当领队？

751
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,960
Utterly preposterous.
那不鸡飞狗跳才怪呢

752
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,380
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.

753

He'll get hurt if we don't find him.

Now, don't you worry, son.

Company, left face!

中尉 我们要给他们来个出其不意

Yes? Yes? Who is it?

It's me, Shere Khan.

Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.
真对不起，顺路经过这儿

838
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,076
No, no. Nothing at all.
哦，没……没有，我没事啊

839
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:39,413
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils.
我以为你正在上面招呼朋友 是不是呀？

I was just curling up for my siesta.

00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,713
But you were singing to someone.

It's simply terrible. I can't eat.
你不知道多麻烦 不能好好吃

852
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:17,243
I can't sleep, so I sing myself to sleep.

Let me show you how it works.
我教你怎么唱好不好啊？

♪ <i>Trust in me</i> ♪

不必了

857
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,090
我可没时间跟你玩这一套

858
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,681
- Some other time, perhaps? - Perhaps.
那或许下次吧 再说吧

859
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,018
But at the moment I am searching for a man cub.
我正在找一个小家伙

860
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,145
"Man cub"? What man cub?

861
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,480
The one who's lost.

00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,108
Now, where do you suppose he could be?

863
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,235
Search me.
你可以搜啊

864
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,946
That's an excellent idea.
好主意

865
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:57,325
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?
介不介意我看看 你身体其他部分？

866
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,994
Certainly not.
当然不介意

867
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:06,209
Nothing here, and nothing in here.
这里没有

868
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,120
这里也没有

869
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,343
My sinuses.
喉咙又痛了

870
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,347
Indeed.
继续啊

871
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,975
And now, how about the middle?
现在该中间啦

872
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,061
The middle?
中间？

873
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,730
The middle.
哦，中间

874
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,363
Absolutely nothing in the middle.
你看什么都没有啊

875
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,909
Really?
真的没有？

876
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,247
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub,
反正你看到那个小家伙的时候

877
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,166
you will inform me first.

- Understand? - I get the point.

- Cross my heart, hope to die. - Good show.
我发誓会通知你 那就好

880
00:59:56,843 --> 01:00:00,680
And I must continue my search for the helpless little lad.
我得先走啰 再去碰碰我的运气

881
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,935
Who does he think he's fooling?
哎呀，可真是会大言不惭啊

882
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,770
"Helpless little lad."

883
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,524
He gives me the shivers.
他还以为真把我给吓死了

884

Picking on that poor little helpless boy.

The poor little helpless boy.
还是留在我肚子里比较安全

887
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,924
You told me a lie, Kaa. You said I could trust you.
你也在骗我，卡奥 还叫我相信你呢

888
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,885
It's like you said.

You can't trust anyone.
