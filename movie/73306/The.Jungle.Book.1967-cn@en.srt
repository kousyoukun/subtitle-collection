1
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,490
许多奇异的传说是讲述印度这片丛林的
Many strange legends are told Of these jungles of India...

2
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,570
没有一个传说能比名叫毛戈力的小男孩的传说更奇异
but none so strange as the story of a small boy named Mowgli.

3
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,410
这个传说开始于一种打破丛林寂静的奇怪的声音
It all began when the silence Of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound.

4
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,620
这种声音在这片丛林从来没听见过
It was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle.

5
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,170
一个婴儿的声音
It was a man cub!

6
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,290
如果知道后来那些事儿有多麻烦
Had I known how deeply I was to be involved...

7
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,840
我本该听从最初的直觉--走开
I would've obeyed my first impulse and walked away.

8
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,260
这个婴孩该吃点食物了，要快
This man cub would have to have nourishment, and soon.

9
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,640
但最近的村子也要走好多天...
It was many days travel to the nearest man village...

10
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,970
没妈妈的照顾，他很快会死
and without a mother's care, he would soon perish.

11
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,140
我想到了
Then it occurred to me.

12
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,020
我认识的一家狼刚幸运地产下一窝小崽
A family of wolves I knew had been blessed with a litter of cubs.

13
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,170
我知道, 由于母性的本能,母亲毫无问题，不过...
Oh, I knew there'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct, but...

14
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,760
对父亲――罗摩，我没把握
I wasn't so sure about Rama, the father.

15
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,770
雨季来来往往了十次
Ten times the rains had come and gone.

16
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,440
我经常顺便去看看人兽过得怎样了
And I often stopped by to see how Mowgli the man cub was getting along.

17
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,940
他是所有一群狼崽中的幸运儿
He was a favorite of all the young wolf cubs of the pack.

18
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,120
没有哪个人兽像他那样快乐
No man cub was ever happier.

19
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,290
然而，我知道有一天
And yet, I knew that someday...

20
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,910
他将不得不回到人群中去
he would have to go back to his own kind.

21
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,630
一天夜晚，狼群中的年长者在议事
Then one night, the wolf pack elders met at council rock...

22
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,590
由于契尔可汗――一只老虎
because Shere Khan the tiger...

23
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,840
已返回这片丛林
had returned to their part of the jungle.

24
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,470
这次会议将改变人兽的一生
This meeting was to change the man cub's entire future.

25
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,470
契尔可汗肯定会杀了小男孩和那些保护他的人
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.

26
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,260
现在，大家都同意要采取的措施吗？
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?

27
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,680
现在我很不情愿地告诉男孩的父亲
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.

28
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,520
罗摩，请到这边来
Rama. Uh, come over here, please.

29
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,810
好，什么事，阿卡拉?  - 会议已一致通过
Yes, Akela?  - The council has reached its decision.

30
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,480
人兽不能再和狼群呆在一起了
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.

31
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,810
他必须马上离开  - 离开？
He must leave at once  - Leave?

32
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,480
很抱歉，罗摩， 没其他办法了
I'm sorry, Rama. There is no other way.

33
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,310
但――这个人兽是就象我自己的儿子
But-- But the man cub is -- Well, he's like my own son.

34
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,360
他当然有资格得到狼群的保护
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.

35
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,030
但是，罗摩，即使一群狼的力量也比不过那只老虎
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.

36
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,950
但是那个男孩一个人，在丛林会活不下去啊。
But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.

37
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,320
阿卡拉，也许我有办法
Akela. Perhaps I can be of help.

38
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,110
你，巴吉拉?怎么办？
You, Bagheera? How?

39
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,450
我知道一个人类村庄，在那他会安全的
I know of a man village where he'll be safe.

40
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,290
毛戈力和我一起在丛林中走过不少路了，我想他会跟我走的
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together, so I'm sure he'll go with me.

41
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,500
就这样。没时间浪费了。祝你好运
So be it. Now there's no time to lose. Good luck.

42
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,750
巴吉拉
Bagheera.

43
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,460
我有点困了，我们要不要回家？
I'm getting a little sleepy. Shouldn't we start back home?

44
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,840
毛戈力，这次我们不回去了
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.

45
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,380
我要带你去一个人类的村庄 - 为什么？
I'm taking you to a man village. - But why?

46
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,010
因为契尔可汗已回到这片丛林
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle.

47
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,390
他发誓要杀了你
And he has sworn to kill you.

48
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,600
杀我？他为什么要这样？
Kill me? But why would he wanna do that?

49
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,720
他恨人类
He hates man.

50
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,020
契尔可汗不让你长大成人的
And Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man--

51
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,230
长成为一个拿枪的猎人
just another hunter with a gun.

52
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,940
哦，我们向他解释说我们永远不会那样做的
Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.

53
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,060
废话。没人可以向契尔可汗解释的
Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan.

54
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,110
也许如此。但我不怕
Well, maybe so. But I'm not afraid.

55
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,230
此外，我--  - 够了，够了
And besides, I--  - Now that's enough.

56
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,860
我们今晚在这过夜。明早一切都会更好的
We'll spend the night here. Things will look better in the morning.

57
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,820
人兽？  人兽！
Man cub? Man cub!

58
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,530
来吧，爬上这棵树。上去时小心些
Now come on, up this tree. Be safer up there.

59
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,450
我不想回到人类村庄
I don't wanna go back to the man village.

60
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,780
继续，向上
Go on. Up you go.

61
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,120
到上面的树枝上吗？ - 对。
That limb way up there? - That's right.

62
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,370
你爬树就这样爬吗？
Is that all the better you can climb?

63
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,210
我-- 噢--这树太大了。
I-- Oh-- It's too big around.

64
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,210
而且，我又没有爪子
And besides, I don't have any claws.

65
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,590
现在睡一觉
Now, get some sleep.

66
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,720
明天我们还得走很多路
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.

67
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,180
我-- 我想待在丛林中
I-- I wanna stay in the jungle.

68
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,390
恩？多待一天也不行。
Huh? You wouldn't last one day.

69
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,020
我不怕。我-我自己会小心的
I'm not afraid. I-I can look out for myself.

70
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,730
比方说，我们这儿有什么？
Say now, what have we here?

71
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,400
一个人兽
It's a man cub.

72
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,190
一个美味的人兽
A delicious man cub.

73
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,860
哦，走开，不要烦我。
Oh, go away and leave me alone.

74
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,410
恩，我应该那样做，但我不会那样。
Oh, that's just what I should do, but I'm not.

75
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,530
现在，现在，快睡着吧，人兽
Now, now, please go to sleep, man cub.

76
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,580
是，人兽，请睡觉吧。
Yes, man cub. Please go to sleep.

77
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,580
请睡觉吧
Please go to sleep

78
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,910
睡觉，小人兽
Sleep, little man cub

79
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,790
安安静静地休息
Rest in peace

80
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,170
睡吧，睡吧
Sleep. Sleep.

81
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,460
巴-- 巴-巴吉--吉拉
Ba-- Ba-Bagh-gheera.

82
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,760
哦。-- 你看，再争辩也没有用
Oh, now-- Now look, there's no use arguing any more.

83
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,380
恩，天亮前不要再说话了。
Oh! Now no more talk till morning.

84
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,260
他早晨不会在这里
He won't be here in the morning.

85
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,760
恩? 哦，对，他会的 我-- 喀!
Hmm? Oh, yes, he will. I-- Kaa!

86
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,760
等等，喀!
Hold it, Kaa!

87
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,930
哦! 我的下巴
Oh! My sinus.

88
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,270
我的朋友，你刚刚犯了个严重的错误
You have just made a serious mistake, my friend.

89
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,230
一个非常愚蠢的...
A very stupid...

90
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,690
现在，现在，现在，现在，我是-- - 错误
Now, now, now, now, Kaa, I was-- - mistake.

91
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,440
我跟你说话时看着我的眼睛
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.

92
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,110
哦，请吧， 喀 - 两只眼，如果你喜欢
Oh, please, Kaa  - Both eyes, if you please.

93
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,940
现在，你的末日就要来了。
You have just sealed your doom.

94
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,950
看，巴吉拉! 看, 巴吉拉.
Look, Bagheera! Look, Bagheera.

95
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,120
醒醒，巴吉拉.
Wake up, Bagheera.

96
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,910
你们就等着吧，等着我把你们缠起来。
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.

97
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,120
巴吉拉, 他的尾巴打了一个结
Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!

98
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,290
他的尾巴打了一个结
"He's got a knot in his tail."

99
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,920
噢，这样让我爬起来要慢很多。
Ooh, this is going to slow down my slither.

100
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,630
所以，你会自己小心的，是吗？
So, you can look out For yourself, can you?

101
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,260
所以，你要待在丛林里，是吗？
So you want to stay in the jungle, do you?

102
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,300
是的，我要待在丛林里。
Yes. I wanna stay in the jungle.

103
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,970
哦! 现在，现在，现在， 说最后一次，去睡觉!
Oh! Now, now, now for the last time, go to sleep!

104
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,430
人兽
Man cub.

105
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,430
人兽
Man cub.

106

巡逻
A parade.

112
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,950
哦，不! 这是早上的巡逻。
Oh, no! The dawn patrol again.

113
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,580
全队，依次报数
Company, sound off!

114
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,540
哦，我们的巡逻，不是闹着玩的
Oh, the aim of our patrol Is a question rather droll

115
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,500
在平地和山岗，列队操练
For to march and drill Over field and hill

116
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,210
是军事需要
Is a military goal

117
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,840
是军事需要
Is a military goal

118
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,170
嘿， 二，三，四

整队 二，三，四
Dress it up two, three, four

120
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,180
一列纵队
By the ranks or single file

121
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,510
走遍丛林每寸土地
Over every jungle mile

122
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,470
哦，踏过西部的丛林
Oh, west amp and crush through the underbrush

123
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,220
以军人的姿态
In the military style

124
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,390
以军人的姿态
In the military style

125
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,390
你好，你在做什么？
Hello. What are you doing?

126
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,350
嘘! 操练。
Shh! Drilling.

127
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,230
我也参加操练，好吗? - 可以.跟着我做
Can I do it too? - Sure. Just do what I do.

128
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,190
但是不要在队伍里说话，那是违反规定的。
But don't talk in ranks. It's against regulations.

129
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,940
向后转!齐步-走!
To the rear! March!

130
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,860
另一边 转身
The other way. Turn around.

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
继续不松劲 二，三，四
Keep it up Two, three, four

133
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,070
向后转！ 豁！
To the rear! Ho!

134
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,830
全队，立定!
Company, halt!

135
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,160
意思是停下来
That means stop.

136
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,410
全队，向左转！
Company, left face!

137
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,420
齐步走，齐步走,齐步走 我的脚可要了我的命
March, march, march. My feet are killing me.

138
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,120
我要被调遣到别的队伍
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd.

139
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,580
请安静!
Silence in the ranks!

140
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,300
打起精神
Dress up that line.

141
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,550
快跑，威尼弗雷德
Pull it in, Winifred.

142
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,050
开始检查！武器！
Inspection! Arms!

143
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,680
把鼻子伸直.
Stick your nose out.

144
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,720
这样？ -对了
Like this? - That's right.

145
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,430
鼻孔太脏了
A dusty muzzle.

146
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,850
士兵，记住，战场上，鼻子能救你的命
Soldier, remember, in battle, that trunk can save your life.

147
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,600
好好照顾它，士兵 - 是，长官！
Take good care of it, my man  - Yes, sir!

148
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,600
很好，继续
Very good. Cary on.

149
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,360
再吐点口水把这武器擦的干净些  - 是，长官
Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets. - Yes, sir.

150
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,440
团队精神
Esprit de corps.

151
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,110
我是靠团队精神，获得“王公第五旅”的委任。
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's fifth pachyderm brigade.

152
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,400
那是在88年，当时... Uh，是不是88年？
Back in '88, it was. Uh, or was it?

153
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,740
又来了。又要说维多利亚十字勋章了
Here it comes. The Victoria Cross bit again.

154
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,660
那时候，我被授予十字勋章...
It was then I received the Victoria Cross...

155
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,530
是因为能勇敢地完成职责
for bravely  above and beyond the call of duty.

156
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,530
那都是过去的事了
Those were the days.

157
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,910
纪律 你们知道，是纪律
Discipline. Discipline was the thing.

158
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,290
塑造了性格，以及所有那一类的东西
Builds character, and all that sort of thing, you know.

159
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,120
噢，噢，说到哪了？ 哦，对。检查
Oh, oh, where was I? Oh, yes. Inspection.

160
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,130
很好
Well, very good.

161
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,290
别咧着嘴傻笑，士兵 这是部队
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier. This is the army.

162
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,210
向前看
Eyes front.

163
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,260
中尉，那发型不符合规定
Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.

164
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,760
你不觉得那华而不实吗？
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?

165
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,840
这样，这样好多了
There. That's better.

166
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,300
至于你--
And as for you--

167
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,970
哦，你还可以
Oh, there you are.

168
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,970
脚后跟并拢，好不好？儿子
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?

169
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,640
好，爸爸。长官
Okay, Pop. Sir.

170
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,100
对，现在好多了。
Yes, now that's better.

171
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,140
噢，新兵，恩？
Well, a new recruit, eh?

172
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,270
我说，你鼻子怎么啦？
I say, what happened to your trunk?

173
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,270
嘿！别那样！
Hey! Stop that!

174
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,900
人兽！ 噢，这是背叛 ！
A man cub! Oh, this is treason!

175
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,280
蓄意破坏! 我不会让我的丛林里出现人兽！
Sabotage! I'll have no man cub in my jungle!

176
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,490
我-这不是你的丛林！-别吵了！别吵了！我来解释一下，哈索
I-It's not your jungle! -Hold it! Hold it! I can explain, Hathi.

177
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,150
哈索上校 如果可以的话，长官
Colonel Hathi, If you please, sir.

178
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,490
哦，好，好 哈索上校
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.

179
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,950
恩，人兽是和我在一起的 我正带着他返回人类村庄
Uh, the man cub is with me. I'm taking him back to the man village.

180
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,660
留下来？- 你有了巴吉拉的命令
To stay? - You have the word of Bagheera.

181
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,160
好，记住 大象从不忘事的
Good. And remember, an elephant never forgets.

182
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,370
我不知道现在部队要怎样
I don't know what the army's coming to these days.

183
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,710
那些年轻的傲慢的家伙 他们以为他们是谁？
These young whippersnappers, who do they think they are?

184
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,790
我们继续！ 向右看！
Let's get on with it! Right face!

185
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,090
前进！
Forward march!

186
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,340
亲爱的，你没忘记什么吧？
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?

187
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,890
废话，威尼弗雷德老太婆 大象从不忘事的
Nonsense, Winifred old girl. An elephant never forgets.

188
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,550
哦，你惟独忘记了我们的儿子
Well, you just forgot our son.

189
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,970
恩，恩，儿子--儿子？
Uh, uh, son-- Son?

190
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,970
儿子！噢，对，对呀，对呀！ 说得对
Son! Oh, yes, yeah, yeah! Quite right.

191
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,010
向后转！齐步走！
To the rear! March!

192
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,270
我长大后，我要当上校，就象我爸爸那――
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a Colonel, just like my--

193
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,350
我说过一次，就要和说过一千次一样――-噢！
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times-- Oh!

194
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,940
爸爸！小心！
Pop! Look out!

195
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,110
哎，爸爸，你忘了说“立定”了
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."

196
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,700
他说过大象从不忘事的
He said an elephant never forgets.

197
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,280
这并不好笑
It's not funny.

198
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,620
趁其他什么事情发生前 立即离开这
Now let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.

199
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,620
巴吉拉！我们要去哪里？
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?

200
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,290
你就要回到人类村庄
You're going back to the man village right now.

201
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,130
我不想去 -噢，你非去不可
I'm not going  - Oh, yes, you are!

202
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,340
我就待在这里！
I'm staying right here!

203
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,960
就算我拖着你走，你也得走
You're going if I have to drag you every step of the way.

204
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,340
让我走，你-- - 你放开我！
Let go, you- - You let go of me!

205
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,010
哦，就这样定了
Oh, that does it.

206
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,890
我受够了，人兽！
I've had it, man cub!

207
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:14,140
从现在开始，你一个人好自为之！
From now on, you're on your own alone!

208
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,730
别担心我
Don't worry about me.

209
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,070
愚蠢的人兽
Foolish man cub.

210
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,260
嘟-哔 嘟-哔 嘟-哔 嘟-哔
Doo-bee doo-bee doo-bee-dee-doo

211
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,720
哦，嘟―吧―的―嘟 对，嘟―吧―的―嘟
Well, it'sa doo-bah-dee-doo Yes, it'sa doo-bah-dee-doo

212
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,970
我说的是嘟―哔 嘟―哔，嘟―哔 嘟―哔，嘟―哔―嘟―哔
l mean a doo-bee doo-bee, doo-bee doo-bee, doo-bee-dee-doo

213
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,890
和―
And with--

214
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,970
好吧，现在
Well, now.

215
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,970
看看这是什么呢？
What have we here?

216
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,060
嘿，多有趣的小―
Hey, what a funny little bit of a--

217
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,390
噢！ - 走开！
Oh! - Go away!

218
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,520
哦，小男孩，这个林子里我啥都见过了
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.

219
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,690
呼！我说什么来着？ 多么可爱的家伙
Hoo! What have I run on? What a pretty thing this is.

220
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,110
别理我  - 好
Leave me alone  - Well, now.

221
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,110
多么可爱的大话! 小家伙
That's pretty big talk, little britches.

222
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,110
我够大了
I'm big enough.

223
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,240
遗憾啊，嘿，小孩, 你需要帮助
Pitiful. Hey, kid, you need help.

224
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,110
老布鲁来教你怎样像熊一样打架
And old Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.

225
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,110
来吧，我来示范
Now come on, I'm gonna show you.

226
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,120
对！
Yeah!

227
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,910
好吧，孩子，放松。完全放松然后开始晃动身体
All right, now, kid, loosen up. Get real loose and then start to weave.

228
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,410
晃动一点点 现在开始移动! 就这样!
Weave a little. Now move! That's it!

229
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,370
现在，给我一个熊的咆哮 吓唬我
Now give me a big bear growl. Scare me.

230
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,330
哦，男孩
Oh, boy.

231
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,420
我说的是像头大熊
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.

232
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,960
他遇到麻烦了！ 咳，我―我不应该留下他一个人的
He's in trouble! Why, I-I shouldn't have left him alone.

233
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,930
一个大的咆哮，用尽全身的力气 - 感觉怎么样？
A big one. Right from your toes  - How's that?

234
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,890
对，你学会了，孩子 - 噢，不！是布鲁
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid  - Oh, no! It's Baloo.

235
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,270
那个无能的愚蠢的丛林流浪汉
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.

236
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,980
左右晃动，寻找空当.
Weave about now and look for an opening.

237
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,980
继续前进，继续-
Keep movin'. Keep--

238
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,150
做得好，你学会了，孩子 再来，就这样
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid. Come on, that's it.

239
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,560
他棒极了
He's a dandy.

240
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,820
真是个好老师, 老铁爪
Fine teacher you are, old iron paws.

241
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,690
哦，谢谢，巴吉拉 - 恩，告诉我，告诉我，恩...
Oh, thanks, Bagheera  - Eh, tell me, tell me, uh...

242
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,900
你把你的学生撞晕之后, uh, 你还指望他记住你教的吗？恩？
after you knock your pupil senseless, uh, how do you expect him to remember the lesson? Hmm?

243
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:48,910
这个, 我-- 我, uh-- 这个, 我没想要把他摔那么重
Well, I-- I, uh-- Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.

244
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,990
我没伤着, 挺好的
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.

245
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,240
我比有些人想象的要强壮
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.

246
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,410
你最好相信这点
You better believe it.

247
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,000
我们再来一次，我要你一直绕圈，要不然我又要撞到你的背了
Now let's go once more.Now I want you to keep circlin' or I'm gonna knock your roof in again.

248
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,000
你要不停地动
You better keep movin'.

249
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,000
嘿! 正好打在我下巴上！
Hey! Right on the button.

250
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,500
不，不，不, 你弄得我很痒
No, no-no, no-no. Now you're ticklin'.

251
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,510
不！不。我们别在丛林里这样
No! No. N-N-Now, now we don't do that here in the jungle.

252
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,430
不，弄得我很痒 我-我受不了这么痒
No, you're ticklin'. I-I can't stand that ticklin'.

253
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,010
救命，巴吉拉！- 噢，孩子，那是他想要的，使劲挠
Help, Bagheera! - Oh, boy, that's all he needs. More confidence.

254
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,470
投降，布鲁？ - 跟你说，我投降
Give up, Baloo? - I give up, I told ya.

255
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,010
嚯！嘿！
Ooh! I give-- Hey!

256
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,020
你知道了？你是对的，孩子。 他们叫你什么？
You know somethin'? You're all right, kid. What do they call you?

257
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,190
毛戈力。他马上就要回人类村庄了
Mowgli. And he's going back to the man village right now.

258
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,150
人类的村子? 他们会毁了他，他们会把他变回一个"人"
Man village? They'll ruin him. They'll make a man out of him.

259
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,020
哦，布鲁，我要和你待在这
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.

260
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,150
那当然
Certainly you do.

261
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,690
噢？你觉得他怎么活下去？
Oh? And just how do you think he will survive?

262
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,240
你觉得他-―― 你指什么，你觉得他――
"How do you think he will--" What do you mean, "How do you think he--"

263
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,530
他和我在一起，不是吗？ 我会教给他我知道的一切
He's with me, ain't he? And I'll learn him all I know.

264
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,900
哦，最好不要太久
Well, that shouldn't take too long.

265
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,070
看，就像这样 小不点
Look, now it's like this, little britches.

266
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,080
你要做的一切是――
All you've gotta do is--

267
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,410
寻找最起码的生活必需品  最起码的生活必需品
Look forthe bare necessities  The simple bare necessities

268
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,370
忘记你的恐惧和矛盾
Forget about your worries And your strife

269
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,500
我的意思是，最基本的需要，是天性中的东西
I mean the bare necessities are Mother Nature's recipes

270
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,750
生命中本能的需要
That bring the bare necessities of life

271
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,420
不管我逛到哪儿,晃到哪儿
Wherever I wander Wherever I roam

272
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,130
最喜欢的仍是我的家
I couldn't be fonder of my big home

273
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,300
蜜蜂在花丛中嗡嗡，为我酿蜜
The bee sare buzzin' in the tree to make some honey just for me

274
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,880
你往石头和植物下面看
When you look under the rocks and plants

275
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,010
看一眼那些可爱的蚂蚁
And take a glance at the fancy ants

276
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,010
或许可以尝几个
Then maybe try a few

277
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,550
你吃蚂蚁吗？
You eat ants?

278
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,060
你最好相信，你会喜欢上它们在你舌头上爬来爬去的感觉
You better believe it. And you're gonna love the way they tickle.

279
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,060
毛戈力，小心！
Mowgli, look out!

280
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,720
生活必需品会有的 - 什么时候会有？
The bare necessities of life will come to you - But when?

281
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,100
会有的
They'll come to you

282
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,520
寻找最起码的生活必需品 那最起码的必需品
Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities

283
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,400
忘记你的恐惧和矛盾
Forget about your worries And your strife

284
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,360
我是说最基本的需要
I mean the bare necessities

285
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,730
这就是一头熊为什么可以逍遥自在
That's why a bear can rest at ease

286
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,820
只需要那最起码的生活必需品
With just the bare necessities Of life

287
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,150
当你摘仙人掌
Now when you pick a paw paw

288
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,530
或者刺梨 - 哎哟！
Or a prickly pear - Ow!

289
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,110
你的手掌被刺到了 下次要小心
And you prick a raw paw Well, next time, beware

290
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,410
不要直接用手掌
Don't pick the prickly pear By the paw

291
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,240
摘梨时 试着用你的指甲
When you pick a pear Try to use the claw

292
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,620
不过摘比较大的果子的时候,不要用你的指甲
But you don't need to use the claw When you pick a pear of the big paw paw

293
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,550
我说清楚了吗? - 真神。谢谢。布鲁
Have I given you a clue? - Golly. Thanks, Baloo.

294
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,550
木瓜
Pawpaw.

295
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,920
什么玩意儿
Of all the silly gibberish.

296
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,170
好了，布吉, 把它打下来
Come on, Baghee, get with the beat.

297
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,800
生活必需品会有的 - 我会有的!！
The bare necessities of life will come to you - They'll come to me!

298
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,430
你会有的
They'll come to you

299
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,470
抓上面那儿 肩膀左边，毛戈力？
How 'bout scratchin' that ol' left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?

300
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,720
头低下一点 在那，就在那。对了。
Now just a hair lower. There. Right there. That's it.

301
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,140
哦！太舒服了
Oh! This is beautiful.

302
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:31,390
不错。孩子，我们要上树 痛痛快快的搔搔
That's good. Kid, we've got to get to a tree. This calls for some big scratchin'.

303
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,390
你太有趣了。布鲁
You're lots of fun, Baloo.

304
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,470
就在这上面。耶！
Right on it. Yeah!

305
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,180
真舒服
That's delicious.

306
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,270
有那么一点--
Just a little bit--

307
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,270
耶！
Yeah!

308
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,650
耶
Yeah.

309
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,490
哦，--朋友, 这才是真正的活着
Oh, man, this is really livin'.

310
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,950
只要试着放松
So just try and relax.

311
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,490
耶。冷静下来
Yeah. Cool it.

312
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,290
我家后院的瀑布
Fall apart in my backyard.

313
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,120
让我来告诉你,小家伙
'Cause let me tell you somethin', little britches.

314
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,790
如果你象蜜蜂一样
If you act like that bee acts...

315
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,160
恩，你干得太辛苦了
uh-uh, you're workin' too hard.

316
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,130
不花费时间四处寻找...
And don't spend your time lookin' around...

317
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,290
那些你想要却得不到的东西
for something you want that can't be found.

318
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,840
当你发现没有它，你可以照样过，就会不再想它
When you find out you can live without it and go along not thinkin' about it

319
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,010
我来告诉你个真理
I'll tell you somethin' true

320
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:58,010
你将拥有生活必需品
The bare necessities of life will come to you

321
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,840
我投降, 我希望他会一直好运气
I give up. Well, I hope his luck holds out.

322
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,600
毛戈力，你来唱一下,怎么样?
Mowgli, how 'bout you sing?

323
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,970
寻找最基本的需要 最基本的需要
Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities

324
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,970
忘记你的担忧和矛盾 - 耶，朋友
Forget about your worries and your strife  - Yeah, man.

325
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,890
我是说最基本的需要
I mean the bare necessities

326
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,270
那就是为什么熊可以逍遥自在
That's why a bear can rest at ease

327
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,100
虽然仅仅满足最基本的需要
With just the bare necessities of life

328
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,060
耶！- 只要满足最基本的需要
Yeah!- With just the bare necessities of life

329
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,300
耶！朋友！
Yeah, man!

330
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,320
太美了 多么和谐的丛林
Beautiful! That's real jungle harmony.

331
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,820
我喜欢做一头熊。 - 这才是我的好孩子。
I like being a bear  - That's my boy.

332
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,910
你会长成一头大熊. 为啥呢, 你唱歌都象熊
And you're gonna make one swell bear. Why, you even sing like one.

333
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,640
嘿，毛戈力，把那只老坏的苍蝇--
Hey, Mowgli, how 'bout you flickin' that old, mean fly...

334
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,710
从你熊爸爸的鼻子上赶走,怎么样?
of fo' your papa bear's nose?

335
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,420
哎哟！
Ouch!

336
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,710
孩子, 在你赶苍蝇的时候, 你真是--
Boy, when you flick a fly, you really--

337
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,460
怎么是你这个塌鼻子,小眼睛,贼头贼脑的家伙
Why you flat-nosed, little-eyed, flaky creep!

338
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,840
嘿！放开我!
Hey! Let go of me!

339
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,840
把你们的脏手从我孩子身上拿开!
Take your flea-pickin' hands of fo' my cub!

340
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,840
来啊,把他带走啊,气急败坏的家伙!
Come on and get him, champ!

341
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,630
他不是气急. 他是内急! - 布鲁！
He ain't no champ. He's a chump! - Baloo!

342
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,670
急得脑门都红了!
Yeah! A big hothead!

343
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,180
耶！你们自找的. 我要--
Okay, you guys asked for it. I'll--

344
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,180
那可以让他清醒一下.
That'll cool him off.

345
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,560
把孩子还给我!
Gimme back my man cub!

346
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,100
他在这儿,来拿啊!
Here he is. Come and get him!

347
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,280
那就是一头熊怎样做到悠闲自在的
That's how a bear can rest at ease.

348
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,320
这儿还有些生活必需品.
Here's some bare necessities.

349
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,060
有种再试试,你们--
Now just try that again, you--

350
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,650
你用什么打他的，孩子？ - 一个生活必需品
What's that you hit him with, son? - That was a bare necessity.

351
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,710
小心着点, 臭猴子, 放开他,否则我给你们尾巴打上结--
Look, monk, you turn him loose or I'll jerk a knot in your tail--

352
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,440
我们投降吧！ 他来了！
We give up! Here he comes!

353
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,060
布鲁！抓住我！
Baloo! Catch me!

354
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,850
布鲁！-退后！退后！再快点! 再快点! 再快点!
Baloo!- Back up! Back up! Faster! Faster! Faster!

355
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,200
熊下去咯,毛毛都滚掉了!
A rolling bear gathers no hair!

356
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,000
布鲁！救救我! 布鲁，他们要带走我！
Baloo! Help me! Baloo, they're carrying me away!

357
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
巴吉拉！
Bagheera!

358
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,960
巴吉拉！
Bagheera!

359
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, 有情况
Well, it's happened.

360
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,760
比我预想的要迟点,但还是发生了
Took a little longer than I thought,but it's happened.

361
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,180
巴吉拉！
Bagheera!

362
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,190
Oh, 你听到了吗?
Oh, you heard me, huh?

363
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,800
毛戈力。毛戈力！
Mowgli. Mowgli!

364
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,700
好吧，出什么事了？ 毛戈力在哪里？
All right, what happened? Where's Mowgli?

365
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,910
他们偷袭了我，一大群猴子
They ambushed me. Thousands of'em.

366
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,430
我左直拳. 右摆拳. 然后--
I jabbed with my left. Then I swung with a right. And then I let--

367
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,600
哦，最后一遍，毛戈力到底怎么啦？
Oh, for the last time, what happened to Mowgli?

368
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,680
正如我跟你说的, 那群猴子把他抓走了
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys carried him off.

369
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:19,270
古代废墟?哦，我不敢想象当他遇到它们的大王,会发生什么
The ancient ruins.Oh, I hate to think what'll happen when he meets that king of theirs.

370
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:47,360
我们抓到他了，路易王！我们抓到他了,抓到他了!
We got him, King Louie!- Here he is. Man, we got him. We got him!

371
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,030
你就是人兽。真疯狂！
So you're the man cub. Crazy.

372
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,190
我可没有你那么疯 把我放下来!
I'm not as crazy as you are. Put me down!

373
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,070
你不会轻一点啊!
You cut that out!

374
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,110
冷静点, 孩子，放松
Cool it, boy.Unwind yourself.

375
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,210
来, 让我们握握手, 我的近亲
Now come on,let's shake, cousin.

376
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,460
你们把我抓来想干嘛?
What do you want me for?

377
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,300
我听说…先吃个香蕉
Word has grabbed my royal ear--Have a banana--

378
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,960
说你想留在丛林里
that you wanna stay in the jungle.

379
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,970
留在丛林里? 确实是
Stay in the jungle? I sure do.

380
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,800
好吧，很好。 老路易王--
Well, good. And old King Louie--

381
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,060
就是我-- 可以帮你实现愿望
That's me-- can fix it for you.

382
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,780
吃两个香蕉吧
Have two bananas.

383
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,140
我们商量一下好吗？- 好，先生
Have we got a deal? - Yes, sir.

384
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,790
我会做-- 我会做任何事情,为了留在从林里
I'll do-- I'll do anything to stay in the jungle.

385
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,420
那么
Well, then.

386
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,540
我会把话给你说清楚
I'll lay it on the line for you.

387
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,830
现在我是时髦之王 丛林中的VIP
Now I'm the king of the swingers Oh, the jungle VlP

388
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,060
我已经到达了极至 不得不停下来
I've reached the top And had to stop

389
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,640
这让我很烦恼
And that's what's botherin' me

390
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,530
我想成为一个人类，一个人，在城里游荡
I wanna be a man, man cub And stroll right into town

391
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,860
像其他人类那样 我已经厌倦了做猴子
And be just like the other men I'm tired of monkeyin' around

392
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,120
哦，哦-必-嘟
Oh, ooh-bee-doo

393
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,040
我要像你一样
I wanna be like you

394
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,880
我要像你那样走路  像你那样说话
I wanna walk like you Talk like you too

395
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,550
你知道这是真的
You see it's true

396
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,300
像我这样一个猴子
An ape like me

397
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:31,970
也能学会做一个人
Can learn to be human too

398
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,270
什么?
What?

399
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,240
嘻， 路易老兄，你干得不错
Gee, Cousin Louie, you're doin' real good.

400
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,580
现在，协议里你应该做的事情就是，表兄
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz.

401
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,420
把人类生火的秘密告诉我
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire.

402
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,760
但是我不知道怎样生火
But I don't know how to make fire.

403
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,600
别想耍我, 小孩子 我们已经达成过协议
Now don't try to kid me, man cub I made a deal with you

404
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,180
我想要的就是人类那红色的火焰
What I desire Is man's red fire

405
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,430
让我梦想成真
To make my dream come true

406
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,440
把秘密告诉我，人兽 说吧，告诉我怎么做
Now give me the secret, man cub Come on, clue me what to do

407
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,990
给我火焰的力量
Give me the power of man's red flower

408
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,160
让我能像你一样
So I can be like you

409
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,120
火？这就是那恶棍想要的东西
Fire? So that's what that scoundrel's after.

410
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,330
我会把它撕成碎片，狠狠揍它
I'll tear him limb from limb. I'll beat him.

411
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,540
我会-- 我会--
I'll-- I'll--

412
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,460
耶！
Yeah!

413
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,720
朋友, 多好的节奏
Well, man, what a beat.

414
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
你可以停止那愚蠢的节奏听我说吗?
Will you stop that silly beat business and listen?

415
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,930
要用脑子,不要蛮干
This will take brains, not brawn.

416
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,520
你最好相信---我是智勇双全的
You better believe it, and I'm loaded with both.

417
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,690
你不能好好听着? - 哦，好，好
Will you listen?- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

418
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,190
现在, 你去制造一场混乱...
Now, while you create a disturbance...

419
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,200
我趁机营救毛戈力 明白了吗？
I'll rescue Mowgli. Got that?

420
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,740
我出发了, 朋友
I'm gone, man. Solid gone.

421
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,500
不是现在，布鲁！
Not yet, Baloo!

422
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,390
嘿！
Hey!

423
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,460
疯狂吧，宝贝！
Get mad, baby.

424
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,180
你  我想跟你一样
You, l wanna be like you

425
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:23,230
像你那样走路 像你那样说话
l wanna walk like you Talk like you too

426
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,610
你明白那是真的
You see it's true

427
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,650
像我这样的
Someone like me

428
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,740
可以学会做个像我这样的人
Can learn to be Like someone like me

429
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,740
带我回家，爸爸！
Take me home, daddy!

430
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,080
可以学做个像你一样的人
Can learn to be Like someone like you

431
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,910
再来一次! - 耶，可以学会---
One more time! - Yeah, can learn to be

432
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,090
像我一样的人
Like someone like me

433
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,600
朋友！-是布鲁那头熊！
Man! - It's Baloo, the bear!

434
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,430
对，是他！那个大块头怎么在那里？
Yeah, that's him! How'd that square get in there?

435
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,440
布鲁，是你！
Baloo, it's you!

436
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,780
那就是我所说的摇摆舞会
Man, that's what I call a swingin' party.

437
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,730
此外,布鲁
And furthermore, Baloo...

438
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,110
毛戈力似乎具有人类的制造麻烦的能力
Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble.

439
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,110
你的影响还没有真正地--
And your influence hasn't been exactly--

440
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,240
嘘，小声些 你会吵醒小家伙的
Shh. Keep it down. You're gonna wake up little buddy.

441
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,960
嗒 - 今天是个大日子
Dah  - Well, he's had a big day.

442
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,170
真是个成功的演出
It was a real sockaroo.

443
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,170
你知道，要学我不容易
You know, it ain't easy learnin' to be like me.

444
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,010
呸！ 表现很糟糕
Pah! A disgraceful performance.

445
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,890
想起那些招人讨厌的，多动症的猴子
Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes.

446
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,100
恩，我希望毛戈力从你那里学到了点什么
Unh. I hope Mowgli learned something from that experience.

447
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,070
咕哔 - 嘟哔, 嘟哔-嘟.
Scooby-dooby, dooby-doo.

448
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,530
那是我孩子
That's my boy.

449
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,990
噢，胡说
Oh, nonsense.

450
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,720
布鲁
Baloo.

451
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,730
过来， 我有话要跟你说
Over here. I'd like to have a word with you.

452
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,270
话? 你还想说什么?
A word? You gonna talk some more?

453
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,900
好吧，怎么啦，巴吉拉？
All right, what's up, Bagheera?

454
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,370
布鲁--
Baloo...

455
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,790
这人兽必须回到人类的村庄
the man cub must go back to the man village.

456
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,590
丛林不是他应该呆的地方
The jungle is not the place for him.

457
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,510
我在丛林中长大, 看看我
I grew up in the jungle. Take a look at me.

458
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,130
对，看看你自己
Yes, just look at yourself.

459
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,260
看看那只眼睛
Look at that eye.

460
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,100
是，很漂亮，不是吗?
Yeah. It's beautiful, ain't it?

461
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,350
老实说, 你的样子很衰
Yeah. Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.

462
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,360
你还不如一篮水果呢
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket off ruit yourself.

463
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,570
欧。
Ohh.

464
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,960
布鲁，你不能收养毛戈力
Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.

465
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,750
为什么不能？
Why not?

466
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,630
我该怎么说? 它--布鲁--
H-H-How can I put it? It-- Baloo...

467
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,510
物以类聚
birds of a feather should flock together.

468
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
你不会和豹结婚，对吗？
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?

469
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,310
我不知道
I don't know.

470
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,940
想了想,从没有一只豹子跟我谈过这事儿
Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.

471
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,820
不,布鲁，你-你能不能严肃点？
No. Baloo, you-you've got to be serious about this.

472
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,630
哦，别担心。布鲁。别担心
Oh, stop woryin', Baghee. Stop woryin'.

473
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,530
我会照顾他的
I'll take care of him.

474
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,660
是的，就像猴子们绑架他时你做的那样？
Yes. Like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?

475
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,580
谁没有犯错的时候? - 不能在丛林里犯错
Can't a guy make one mistake? - Not in the jungle.

476
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,580
还有一件事
And another thing.

477
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,590
迟早, 毛戈力会碰到歇尔可汗
Sooner or later, Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.

478
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,310
那只老虎? 它为什么和这孩子作对?
The tiger? What's he got against the kid?

479
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,980
它跟人类有仇 你知道的
He hates man with a vengeance. You know that.

480
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,110
因为他害怕人类的枪和火
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.

481
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,820
但是小毛戈力没有那些东西
But little Mowgli don't have those things.

482
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,820
歇尔可汗不会等到他有那些东西
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.

483
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,490
它会在毛戈力年幼无助的时候抓住他
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.

484
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,750
只要这么一下… -不
Just one swipe and-- - No.

485
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,420
好啦--好啦，我们该怎么办？
Well-- Well, what are we gonna do?

486
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,460
我们要做对这孩子最有利的事情 -你最好相信这点
We'll do what's best for the boy - You better believe it.

487
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,250
你说吧,我一定照做
You name it, and I'll do it.

488
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,130
很好. 把毛戈力送回人类村庄
Good. Then make Mowgli go to the man village.

489
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,470
你疯了吗？我答应过他--
Are you out of your mind? I promised him...

490
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,470
它可以留在这儿,和我一起在丛林里
he could stay here in the jungle with me.

491
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,350
这就是关键 只要他留下来和你在一起---
Well, that's just the point. As long as he remains with you...

492
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,020
就很危险,这取决于你
he's in danger, so it's up to you.

493
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,740
为什么是我？ - 因--因--因为他不听我的
Why me? - Be-Be-Because he won't listen to me.

494
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,740
我爱那孩子
I love that kid.

495
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,790
我爱他就像我自己的孩子
I love him like he was my own cub.

496
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:13,420
那么想想什么对毛戈力最好，而不是对你
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.

497
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,300
能否-那么, 我可以等到天亮再....?
Uh, well, can't-- Well, can't I wait until morning?

498
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,300
已经天亮了
It's morning now.

499
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,300
来吧，布鲁
Go on, Baloo.

500
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,480
恩--
Uh--

501
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,120
哦，孩子
Oh, boy.

502
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,090
毛戈力，毛戈力
Mowgli. Mowgli.

503
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,680
该起床了
Uh, it's time to get up.

504
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,720
哦。你好，布鲁
Oh. Hi, Baloo.

505
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,940
把那些瞌睡虫从你眼睛里赶走
Hi. Hey, rub that old sleep out of your eyes.

506
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,190
你和我，我们还有很长一段路要走
You and me, uh, we got a long walk ahead of us.

507
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,570
大熊，我们在一起会有很多快乐
Swell. Gee, we'll have lots of fun together.

508
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:16,450
那当然 对了，恩--
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Uh--

509
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,420
好吧, 上路吧, 孩子
All right, let's hit the trail, kid.

510
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,790
回见 恩，巴吉拉.
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.

511
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,840
再见，巴吉拉
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.

512
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,010
布鲁和我，我们有很多事情要做
Me and Baloo, we've got things to do.

513
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,470
再见, 孩子，祝你好运
Goodbye, man cub. And good luck.

514
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,770
来吧，布鲁 我们要做的是――
Come on, Baloo. All we gotta do is--

515
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,610
寻找生活必需品
Look for the bare necessities

516
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,940
一些生活必需品
Some good old bare necessities

517
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:45,070
忘记你的担忧和矛盾
Forget about your worries And your strife

518
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,950
我是说生活必需品
l mean the bare necessities

519
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,250
那就是为什么熊可以逍遥自在
That's why a bear can rest at ease

520
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:54,120
仅仅拥有生活必需品
With just the bare necessities of life

521
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,960
耶，我会生活在这丛林里
Yeah I'll live here in the jungle

522
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,800
一辈子, 耶
All my life Yeah, man

523
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,550
我喜欢做一只熊
I like bein' a bear.

524
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:08,140
我们在往哪儿走，布鲁？ -哦，恩，去--，恩--
Where we goin', Baloo? - Well, uh, it's, uh--

525
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,980
恩，哦，这次去一个新地方 恩――
Um, well, it's sort of new and, uh--

526
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,860
哦，我不在意，只要和你在一起.
Oh, I don't care,as long as I'm with you.

527
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,030
毛戈力，恩，听着, 伙计, 恩--
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh...

528
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,200
有些事情我得告诉你.
there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.

529
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,660
告诉我什么，布鲁？
Tell me what, Baloo?

530
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,710
唉
Gee whiz.

531
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,090
老布鲁该怎么说? 这, uh--
Now how did old Baghee put it? It's, uh--

532
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,880
恩，恩，毛戈力？
Uh, uh, Mowgli?

533
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,090
哈！你不会娶一头豹子, 是不是?
Ha! You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?

534
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,100
我不知道你在说什么
Gee, I don't even know what you're talkin' about.

535
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,560
毛戈力，你没有认识到你是一个人类吗?
Mowgli, don't you realize that you're a human?

536
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,770
我不再是了，布鲁。我是一头熊，就像你一样。
I'm not any more, Baloo. I'm a bear like you.

537
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,650
小伙计, 来,听我说.
Little buddy, look, listen to me.

538
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,820
来吧，来吧，布鲁  - 毛戈力，停下，停下
Come on. Come on, Baloo - Now, Mowgli, stop it now.

539
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,450
别乱跑. 我-我想跟你好好谈谈
Now hold still. I-I want to tell you something.

540
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,490
现在听我说
Now listen to me.

541
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,160
怎么啦。老熊爸爸？ 听着 -毛戈力---
What's the matter, old Papa Bear? - Look, Mowgli...

542
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,080
我要告诉你，我一上午都在想告诉你.
I been tyin' to tell ya. I been tyin' all morning to tell ya.

543
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,550
我要把你送回人类的村子
I've got to take you back to the man village.

544
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,670
人类村庄！- 孩子，听我说--
The man village! - Now look, kid...

545
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,590
我可以解释--- 可是, 你说我们是伙伴.
I can explain, and-- - But, but you said we were partners.

546
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,270
相信我，孩子，我-我-我-- -你就像，就像老巴吉拉！
Now believe me, kid, I-I-I-- - You're just like, like old Bagheera!

547
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,770
就一会儿，太过分了
Now just a minute. That's goin' too far.

548
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,230
嘿，毛戈力， 你要去哪里？
Hey, Mowgli, where you goin'?

549
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,700
等一等！站住！
Wait a minute! Stop!

550
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,080
等等！
Wait!

551
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,910
等等！听听老布鲁的
Wait! Listen to old Baloo.

552
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,670
毛戈力，毛戈力！
Mowgli. Mowgli!

553
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
毛戈力！
Mowgli!

554
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,470
- 毛戈力。毛戈力！- 发生什么了?
- Mowgli. Mowgli! - Now what's happened?

555
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,220
你, 你, 你大概不会相信我, 巴吉拉---
Well, you, you, you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera...

556
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,730
可是, 我照你说的那样说了, 然后他就跑了.
but look, now I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me.

557
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,690
好啦，别光站在那儿
Well, don't just stand there.

558
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,200
我们分头找吧。我们-- 我们一定要找到他
Let's separate.We-- We've got to find him.

559
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,490
噢，如果这小家伙出了什么事---
Oh, if anything happens to that little guy...

560
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,330
我永远不能原谅我自己
I'll never forgive myself.

561
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,460
我一定要找到他， 毛戈力！
I gotta find him. Mowgli!

562
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:10,040
毛戈力！
Mowgli.

563
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,440
嘿，二，三，四
Hup, two, three, four

564
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,650
嘿，二，三，四
Hup, two, three, four

565
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,780
不松劲 二，三
Keep it up Two, three

566
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,320
真不走运
What beastly luck.

567
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,160
那个可笑的哈索上校真讨厌
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.

568
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,870
部队, 安静
Company, sound off.

569
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,170
我们到处行军
Oh, we march from here to there

570
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,840
不论到哪儿
And it doesn't matter where

571
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,510
你可以听到我们穿过灌木丛
You can hear us push through the deepest bush

572
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,720
嘿，二，三，四
Hup, two, three, four

573
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,260
伴随军乐曲
With a military air

574
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,100
伴随军乐曲
With a military air

575
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,190
丛林巡逻
The jungle patrol.

576
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,820
我们是无敌雄师
We're a cracker jack brigade

577
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,240
在阅兵场上
On a pachyderm parade

578
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,240
但我们宁愿在泥沼里穿行
But we'd rather stroll to a waterhole

579
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,330
嘿，二，三，四
Hup, two, three, four

580
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,960
在树荫下休息
For a furlough in the shade

581
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,920
停下! 等--等一会
Stop! W-Wait a minute.

582
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,130
立定！
Halt!

583
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,550
是谁说的立定？这里由我发令！
Who said halt? I give the commands around here.

584
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,890
大声说，你是谁？ - 哦，是我，上校
Now speak up. Who was it? - Oh, it was me, Colonel.

585
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,230
你什么意思, 先生, 冒用我的命令?
What do you mean, sir,taking over my command?

586
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,320
非常无礼, 你知道 -喔，上校, 我--我很抱歉...
Highly irregular, you know  - Oh, Colonel, I-I'm sorry...

587
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,990
可是, 可是我需要你的帮助  -哦，没门
but, but I need your help  - Oh, absolutely impossible.

588
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,660
我们在越野行军 - 但是这很紧急，上校
We're on a cross-county march  - But it's an emergency, Colonel.

589
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,580
一定要找到那个人兽 - 人兽？什么人兽？
The man cub must be found - Man cub? What man cub?

590
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,800
真有趣  - 我正要送回人类村庄的那个
How interesting  -The one I was taking to the man village.

591
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,260
好, 那是他应该呆的地方.
Good. That's where he belongs.

592
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,260
先生,如果你不介意...
Now, sir, If you don't mind...

593
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:32,260
我们要继续行军了
we'd like to get on with the march.

594
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:35,850
不，不，不，你 你不了解，哈索
No, no, no, you, you don't understand, Hathi.

595
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,480
他走丢了，他跑了
He is lost. He ran away.

596
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,730
真不错
How delightful.

597
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,200
好吧，自以为是的年轻人经常如此
Well, serves the young whippersnapper right.

598
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,200
但是，但是，歇尔可汗，那只可怕的老虎--
But, but Shere Khan, the tiger--

599
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,830
他一定会找到这个人兽踪迹的
He's sure to pick up the man cub's trail.

600
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,210
歇尔可汗？胡说, 伙计
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.

601
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,260
这几英里范围内不会出现歇尔可汗
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here.

602
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,390
哦，抱歉，巴吉拉
Oh, sorry, Bagheera.

603
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,680
战争的命运, 诸如此类的事,你知道
Fortunes of war, and all that sort of thing, you know.

604
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:10,900
够了！够了！
This has gone far enough. Far enough.

605
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,730
等等, 你这个饶舌的老家伙
Now just a minute, you pompous old windbag.

606
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,030
威尼弗雷德！你不在队伍中，在干什么？
Winifred! What are you doing out of ranks?

607
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,120
别管这个！
Never mind.

608
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,290
你要把我们的孩子怎么样――
How would you like to have our boy...

609
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:25,620
把他一个人丢在丛林中？
lost and alone in the jungle?

610
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,040
我们的儿子？好吧--
Our son? W-Well--

611
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,460
但是，威尼弗雷德老太婆，那完全不一样
But, Winifred old girl, that's an entirely different matter.

612
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,380
哼！- 不一样，完全不一样
Huh! - Different, entirely.

613
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,090
那个小男孩跟我们的儿子没有两样
That little boy is no different than our own son.

614
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,880
现在你帮忙找到他，否则我接管指挥权
Now you help find him, or I'm taking over command.

615
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,710
什么！一头母象来领导我的部队?
What! A female leading my herd?

616
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,980
太可笑了
Utterly preposterous.

617
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,150
爸爸？那个人兽和我是好朋友
Pop? The man cub and I are friends.

618
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,590
如果我们不找到他，他会受到伤害的
He'll get hurt If we don't find him.

619
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,300
求你了，爸爸？长官 求你了？
Please, Pop? Sir? Please?

620
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,350
别担心，儿子。
Now don't you worry, son.

621
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,060
你老爸早就有主意了
Your father had a plan in mind all the time.

622
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,020
当然有。
Sure you did.

623
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,890
士兵们！ 全队，向左转！
Troopers! Company, left face!

624
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,980
志愿参加一项特殊任务的――
Volunteers for a special mission...

625
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,020
向前一步走
will step one pace forward.

626
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,320
那是我希望看到的，忠于职责
That's what I like to see. Devotion to duty.

627
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:43,070
现在，你们志愿者要去找一个迷路的人兽
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub.

628
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,330
哦，谢谢你，上校。 没时间可浪费了
Oh, thank you, Colonel. Now there's no time to lose.

629
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,080
是的，是的 好吧，号手…
Yes, yes. Well, bugler.

630
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,160
一看见人兽， 你就吹号…
When the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet...

631
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,450
三次  -是，长官
three times  - Yes, sir.

632
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,110
不是现在，士兵
Not now, soldier.

633
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,400
对不起，长官
Sorry, sir.

634
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:07,530
中尉，我们的策略将出其不意
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be the element of surprise.

635
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,290
你带一个班――
You will take one squad...

636
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,840
搜寻右侧  -是，长官
and cover the right flank  - Yes, sir.

637
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,300
我带另一个班――
And I shall lead the other squad...

638
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,760
在左侧
on the left flank.

639
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,510
很好。全队――
Very well. Company...

640
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,760
向前走！
forward march!

641
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,430
出其不意?
Element of surprise?

642
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,640
哦，我说。
Oh, I say.

643
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,170
那么现在，我要去和那个迷路的小人兽会合了
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub.

644
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,310
喀！是你！
Kaa! It's you!

645
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,900
对，人兽
Yes, man cub.

646
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,770
很高兴又见到你
So nice to see you again.

647
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,980
哦，走开 让我一个人呆着
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.

648
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,110
让我看看你
Let me look at you.

649
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,990
不想让我看你?
You don't want me to look at you?

650
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,990
那你看我吧
Then you look at me.

651
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,160
不，先生，我知道你要干什么，咯――
No, sir. I know what you're tryin' to do, Kaa--

652
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,080
你知道？恩，我是说――
You do? Uh, I mean...

653
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,990
你不相信我 -不
you don't trust me  - No.

654
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,000
那我可就没法帮你了
Then there's nothing I can do to help.

655
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,150
你想帮我?
You wanna help me?

656
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,330
当然了
Certainly.

657
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,500
我看得出来你从来没有离开过这个丛林
I can see to it that you never have to leave this jungle.

658
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,500
你怎么知道?
How could you do that?

659
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,630
恩？哦，我有自己的――
Hmm? Oh, I have my own...

660
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,630
小窍门
subtle little ways.

661
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,630
但是首先 你得相信我
But first, you must trust me.

662
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,760
我不再相信任何人了
I don't trust anyone any more.

663
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,680
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

664
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,050
我不像那些叫做――
I'm not like those so-called...

665
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,350
你那些只能共安乐的朋友
fair-weather friends of yours.

666
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,680
你可以相信我
You can believe in me.

667
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:41,810
信任我
Trust in me

668
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,690
就信我
Just in me

669
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,020
闭上眼睛
Shut your eyes

670
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,770
相信我
And trust in me

671
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,320
安静别动
Hold still, please.

672
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,820
你可以睡觉
You can sleep

673
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,860
安然无恙
Safe and sound

674
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:10,700
知道我在
Knowing I

675
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,570
在身边
Am around

676
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:21,290
安静地睡吧
Slip into silent slumber

677
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:25,120
在银色的薄雾上航行
Sail on a silver mist

678
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,580
感到慢慢的、稳稳的
SlowIy and sure lyyoursenses

679
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,620
不要反抗
Will cease to resist

680
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,790
你在打呼噜
You're snoring.

681
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,590
对不起
Sorry.

682
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,880
相信我
Trust in me

683
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:50,380
就信我
And just in me

684
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:54,550
闭上眼睛
Shut your eyes

685
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,220
相信我
And trust in me

686
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,430
哦，什么人？
Oh, now what?

687
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,430
我就来
I'll be right down.

688
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,560
谁呀？谁呀？是谁？
Yes? Yes? Who is it?

689
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,150
是我，歇尔可汗
It's me, Shere Khan.

690
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,770
不介意的话，我有话要和你说
I'd like a word with you If you don't mind.

691
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,520
歇尔可汗
Shere Khan.

692
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,900
太惊奇了
What a surprise.

693
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,320
对，不是吗？
Yes, isn't it?

694
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,740
我顺便路过 请原谅我打扰了
I just dropped by. Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

695
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,820
不，不，不 根本不
Oh, no, no, nothing at all.

696
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:38,950
我想你可能正缠绕着什么人做游戏
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils.

697
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,530
缠着？什么人？  哦。没有
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.

698
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,490
我刚才只是蜷着身子在午休
I was just curling up for my siesta.

699
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,450
可是你在向谁唱歌？是谁，喀？
But you were singing to someone. Who is it, Kaa?

700
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,160
恩，谁？没有谁，没有谁
Uh, who? Oh, no.

701
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:58,040
哦，我只是唱给-恩，自己听
Well, I was just singing, uh, to myself.

702
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:00,750
真的 -对，对，你知道-
Indeed  - Yes. Yes, you see...

703
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,880
我的鼻子出了点毛病
I have trouble with my sinuses.

704
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,210
真可怜  - 哦，你不知道
What a pity  - Oh, you have no idea.

705
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,380
那简直难受极了
It's simply terrible.

706
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,460
我不能吃 不能睡
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

707
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,260
所以我给自己唱歌
So I sing myself to sleep.

708
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,760
你知道的，自我催眠
You know, self-hypnosis.

709
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,220
让我给你演示一下
Let me show you how it works.

710
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,800
哦，相信我
Ah, trust in me

711
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:35,140
不, 我已经烦了. 我没时间听你的那些胡说八道.
No, I can't be bothered with that. I have no time for that sort of nonsense.

712
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,600
另外找个时间怎么样?
Some other time perhaps?

713
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,520
也许吧。现在我在找一个人兽
Perhaps. But at the moment I am searching for a man cub.

714
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,270
人兽？什么人兽？
Man cub? What man cub?

715
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,520
那个迷路的人兽
The one who's lost.

716
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,270
你猜他现在可能在哪？
Now where do you suppose he could be?

717
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,690
搜我身! - 好主意
Search me. - That's an excellent idea.

718
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,480
我肯定你不介意让我看看你蜷着的身子, 是吧 喀？
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?

719
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,690
恩，当然不介意
Uh, certainly not.

720
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,490
什么也没有
Nothing here.

721
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,780
这也没有
And nothing in here.

722
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,030
我的鼻子
My sinuses.

723
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,740
恩，确实是没有
Hmm. Indeed.

724
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:23,080
中间那部分呢?
And now, how about the middle?

725
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,250
中间？
The middle?

726
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,330
哦，中间
Oh, the middle.

727
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,290
中间绝对没有任何东西
Absolutely nothing in the middle.

728
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,840
真的吗？
Really?

729
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,380
好吧，如果你真的碰巧看见人兽――
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub...

730
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:48,470
你一定要最先告诉我,明白吗?
you will inform me first, understand?

731
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:53,970
我明白, 用我的脑袋发誓.
I get the point. Cross my heart, hope to die.

732
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,300
很好
Good show.

733
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:00,300
现在我要继续去寻找那个无助的小孩
And now I must continue my search for the helpless little lad.

734
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,310
哦，它以为它在愚弄谁?
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling?

735
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,140
"那个无助的小孩."
"The helpless little lad."

736
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:11,140
他让我发抖.
Ooh, he gives me the shivers.

737
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,440
找那个可怜的无依无靠的男孩
Picking on that poor little helpless boy.

738
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,400
哦，对
Oh, yes.

739
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,400
可怜无助的小男孩
Poor little helpless boy.

740
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,200
你说谎，喀
You told me a lie, Kaa.

741
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,200
你说我可以相信你
You said I could trust you.

742
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,950
你说的对
It's like you said.

743
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:43,240
你不能相信任何人
You can't trust anyone.

744
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,660
如果我再看到那个小东西...
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again...

745
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,000
我不会再让他跑掉
it will be too soon.

746
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,750
呵，我的尾巴
Ooh, my sacroiliac.

747
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,840
嘿，我们要干什么？
Hey, Flaps, what we gonna do?

748
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:27,010
我不知道 你想干什么?
I don't know. What you wanna do?

749
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,890
我有主意了! 让我们飞到丛林的东边去
I've got it! Let's flap over to the east side of the jungle.

750
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:32,720
他们总会搞些活动,狂欢什么的
They've always got a bit of action, a bit of a swingin' scene all right.

751
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,100
噢，别吹牛了, 四处都是死寂一片
Ah, come off it. Things are right dead all over.

752
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,770
你的意思是你希望那些
You mean you wish they were.

753
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:43,480
很有趣
Very funny.

754
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,230
好吧，我们要做什么？
Okay. So what we gonna do?

755
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:51,440
我不知道 你想要做什么？
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

756
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,320
你看，弗莱普斯，我先说 “我们要做什么？”
Look, Flaps, first I say, "What we gonna do?"

757
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,320
然后你说, "我不知道,你想干什么?"
Then you say, "I don't know. What you wanna do?"

758
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,320
然后我说，“我们要做什么？” 你说，“你打算干什么？”
Then I say, "What we gonna do?" You say, "What you wanna do?"

759
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,860
"我们干什么?" "你想干什么--"  让我们干点什么!
"What we gonna do?" "What you want--" Let's do something!

760
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,740
好。你想做些什么？
Okay. What you wanna do?

761
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,860
啊呀。 你又来了。又是老一套。
Blimey. There you go again. The same notes again.

762
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,610
我有主意了! 这次我真的有主意了.
I've got it! This time I've really got it.

763
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,320
你有了新主意 那我们接下来干什么？
So you've got it. Then what we gonna do?

764
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:18,740
别急，伙计。看，看什么向我们走过来了.
Hold it, lads. Look. Look what's coming our way.

765
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,740
嘿，那究竟是什么？
Hey, what in the world is that?

766
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:25,790
这堆骨头看上去真疯狂
What a crazy-looking bunch of bones.

767
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,870
他们全都自己走过来了
Yeah, and they're all walkin' about by themselves.

768
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,710
是的
Yeah.

769
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:37,460
所以我们要做什么？ -我不知道
So what we gonna do?  - I don't know.

770
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,540
嘿，别又开始绕嘴
Hey, now don't start that again!

771
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:43,420
来吧，让我们跟这个小家伙找点乐子...
Come on, lads. Come on. Let's have some fun with this little fella...

772
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,630
这个小笨蛋
this little blokey.

773
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,190
他有鹳一样的腿
Blimey. He's got legs like a stork, he has.

774
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:04,060
像一只鹳. 但是他没有羽毛,没有
Like a stork. But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.

775
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,230
说吧，笑吧，我不在乎
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.

776
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,810
他怎么啦？ - 我们玩过火了
What's wrong with him? - I think we overdid it.

777
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,730
我们只是开个小玩笑，没别的。
We were just having a bit Of fun, that's all.

778
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,070
哦，你看他，可怜的小家伙
Oh, just look at him. Why, the poor little fella.

779
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,940
你知道, 他一定是倒了霉
You know, he must be down on his luck.

780
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,820
说得对，否则他就不是我们的邻居了
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood.

781
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:38,200
嘿，新来的 等一等！嘿！
Hey, new kid, wait a minute! Hey!

782
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,570
让我一个人呆着 - 哦，来吧，怎么啦？
Just leave me alone  - Oh, come on. What's wrong?

783
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:45,450
你知道, 你看起来像是在这个世界上没有一个朋友..
You know, you look like you haven't got a friend in the world.

784
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,030
我没有 - 你有父母吗?
I haven't  - Haven't you got a mother or a father?

785
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,660
没有，没人愿跟我在一起
No. Nobody wants me around.

786
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,580
哦，我们明白你的感受.
Yeah, we know how you feel.

787
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,910
也没人想和我在一起
Nobody wants us around either.

788
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,420
啊啊，我们看上去有点邋遢,但我们有心
Ah, we may look a bit shabby, but we've got heart.

789

也有感情

为了证明这一点,我们邀请你加入我们的小集体

01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:11,340
孩子，我们会让你做一只受人尊敬的秃鹰
Kid, we'd like to make you an honouray vulture.

792
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,550
谢谢，我-我宁可一个人呆着
Thanks, but I-- I'd rather be on my own, alone.

793
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,550
看着, 孩子
Aw, now look, kid.

794

当你正在外面徘徊
And when you're outside lookin' in

谁为你开门？ -来吧，孩子，我们需要一个男高音
Who's there to open the door  - Come on, kid. We need a tenor.

809
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:16,780
那就是  - 那就是朋友

哈哈，你学会了, 孩子
Ha-ha. You take it, kid.

818
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:54,010
不喜欢？
Didn't like

819
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,970
你知道我们是朋友
So you can see we're friends

Whoop, whoop. Take it easy, lads.- We'll keep you safe

824
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,720
留神,小心！- 在丛林中
Steady, steady. Watch it! - In the jungle

825
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:14,390
永远地
Forevermore

826
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,100
那就是朋友的…
That's what friends

827
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:26,820
作用
Are for

828
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,570
棒极了, 棒极了
Bravo, bravo.

829
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,320
表演棒极了
An extraordinary performance.

830
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,150
谢谢你们帮我抓住了我的猎物
And thank you for detaining my victim.

831
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,400
哦，要--别客气，殿下
Uh, do-don't mention it, Your Highness.

832
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,140
嘘 - 我们离开这
Boo. - Let's get out of here.

833
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,680
给我留点地方!！让路！
Give me room! Gangway!

834
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,580
跑，朋友！快跑！
Run, friend! Run!

835
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,830
跑？我为什么要跑？
Run? Why should I run?

836
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:54,830
你为什么要跑？
Why should you run?

837
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,160
你难道不知道我是谁?
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am?

838
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:01,330
我认识你，你是歇尔可汗。
I know you, all right. You're Shere Khan.

839
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,330
好极了,那么你一定也知道...
Precisely. Then you should also know...

840
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:07,420
所有人看见我都要跑
that everyone runs from Shere Khan.

841
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,840
你吓唬不了我，我不会从任何人身边逃跑
You don't scare me. I won't run from anyone.

842
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,010
奥，你这么小有勇气
Ah. You have spirit for one so small.

843
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,100
这样的勇气应该得到一个公平的比赛机会
And such spirit is deserving of a sporting chance.

844
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:25,150
现在，我闭上眼睛数到十
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten.

845
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,800
这会使追捕变得更加有趣...
It makes the chase more interesting...

846
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,800
对我来说
for me.

847
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:33,560
一，二---
One, two...

848
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,060
三---
three...

849
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:39,040
四---
four--

850
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,680
你在考验我的耐心
You're tying my patience.

851
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,790
五，六，七，八，九，十！
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

852
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:49,720
跑，毛戈力，快跑！
Run, Mowgli. Run!

853
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,690
躲开, 你这个笨蛋
Let go, you big oaf.

854
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,110
别紧张。拿着-- 呜！抓住，抓住
Take it easy. Take it-- Whoo! Ho-Hold it, hold it.

855
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,530
哇。慢一点。呵！约！哇！慢！现在好了。
Whoa. Slow down. Ooh! Yow! Whoa! Slow! Easy now.

856
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,650
呵，噢，孩子，好了
Ooh. Oh, boy. Easy.

857
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,650
他抓住了老虎尾巴，他抓到了
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.

858
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,740
最好抓得够紧
And he'd better hang on too.

859
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,250
看打, 你这个欺软怕硬的家伙
Take that, ya big bully.

860
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,200
打他, 孩子,再打他, 孩子， 继续!
Let him have it again, kid. Hit him again, kid. Go on!

861
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,700
布鲁！救我！
Baloo! Help me!

862
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,000
谁来救救这孩子
Somebody do somethin' with that kid.

863
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,130
来吧，伙计们
Come on, lads.

864
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:45,380
他现在安全了
He's safe now.

865
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:47,550
你可以放开了，布鲁
You can let go, Baloo.

866
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:51,380
你在开玩笑? 老虎的牙可不是吃素的
Are you kiddin'? There's teeth in the other end.

867
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,550
我要杀了你
I'll kill you for this.

868
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,560
放开我！布鲁需要帮助！
Let go! Baloo needs help!

869
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,520
火! 那是那老虎唯一害怕的
Fire! That's the only thing old Stripes is afraid of.

870
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,890
你去取火，剩下的由我来.
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.

871
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,570
冲啊！-去那边！拳打！脚踢！
Charge! - You there, punch and blow.

872
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:26,320
滚开,你们这些笨蛋
Stay out of this, you mangy fools.

873
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,110
是，是 它差一点
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did.

874
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,280
是！- 是！扯他那亮亮的胡须
Yeah!- Yeah! Pull his blinkin' whiskers.

875
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,140
他是个讨厌的大猫，的确是！
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is.

876
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,100
看看你的身后,朋友
Look behind you, chum.

877
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,050
他的末日到了
Well, that's the last of him.

878
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,210
老斑毛离开就像一颗燃烧的彗星，的确是
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did.

879
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,180
来吧. 让我们祝贺我们的朋友
Well, come on. Let's go congratulate our friend.

880
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,100
等等, 伙计们
Hold it, fellas.

881
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:13,060
现在还不是时候，看
Now's not the time for it. Look.

882
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,490
布鲁？
Baloo?

883
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:34,100
布鲁，起来啦 哦，请起来啦
Baloo, get up. Oh, please get up.

884
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:47,270
毛戈力，试着理解
Mowgli, try to understand.

885
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,020
巴吉拉，他怎么啦？
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?

886
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:54,110
你要勇敢点，就像布鲁那样
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was.

887
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,900
你--你不是说--
You-- You don't mean--

888
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:00,530
别这样，别这样。布鲁
Oh, no. Baloo.

889
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,050
现在，现在
Now, now.

890
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,320
我理解你的感受
I know how you feel.

891
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:14,060
但是你必须记住 毛戈力--
But you must remember, Mowgli...

892
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,620
没有哪种更伟大的爱--
greater love hath no one...

893
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,370
比得上为朋友牺牲生命
than he who lays down his life for his friend.

894
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,070
当伟大的功绩被这个丛林记住...
When great deeds are remembered in this jungle...

895
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,490
有一个名字高高在上
one name will stand above all others--

896
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:35,830
我们的朋友, 布鲁, 一只伟大的熊.
our friend, Baloo, the bear.

897
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,170
他真煽情 - 布鲁给我们的记忆...
He's crackin' me up  - The memory of Baloo's...

898
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,170
它的勇敢和牺牲...
sacrifice and bravey...

899
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,760
将永远铭刻在我们的心上.
will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts.

900
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,590
太棒了 - 布鲁倒下的地方--
Beautiful - This spot where Baloo fell...

901
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:56,270
将成为丛林里的圣地...
will always be a hallowed place in the jungle...

902
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,240
因为这里躺着自然界--
for there lies one of nature's...

903
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,240
最高尚的动物
noblest creatures.

904
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,910
我希望我妈妈能听到这些
I wish my mother could've heard this.

905
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:10,210
现在我们得走了
It's best we leave now.

906
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,310
过来，人兽
Come along, man cub.

907
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,310
嘿，别就不说了，巴吉拉 你说得太感人了！
Hey, don't stop now, Baghee. You're doin' great!

908
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,220
再说一些，继续说吧
There's more, lots more.

909
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,480
什么, 你这个大骗子!
Why, you big fraud!

910
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,930
你 你 你这个装模做样的家伙!
You, you, you four-flusher!

911
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,230
我-我受够了--我--
I-I'm fed up, and I-I--

912
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,900
布鲁！你没事！
Baloo! You're all right!

913
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:33,200
谁，我吗？我当然没事
Who, me? Sure I am.

914
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,620
感觉不能再好了
Never felt better.

915
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,320
你的确让我们担心
You sure had us worried.

916
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,990
哦，我只是休息了一下
Ah, I was just takin' five.

917
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,380
你知道吗, 刚才很过瘾.
You know, playin' it cool.

918
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:49,430
是的，那老虎不堪一击
Yeah, but he was too easy.

919
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,450
你真好，熊爸爸
Good old Papa Bear.

920
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,890
没有这个小家伙，有些无趣，是不是?
It's going to be a bit dull without the little bloke, isn't it?

921
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,160
耶。那么我们干什么呢？
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

922
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:01,230
不知道 嘿，别又来了
I don't know. Hey, now, don't start that again!

923
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,250
嘿，巴吉拉， 你错过这次行动真太惨了
Hey, Baghee, too bad you missed the action.

924
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,530
你要是看见我把那该死的老虎打得落花流水就好了
You should have seen how I made a sucker out of old Stripes with that left up in his face.

925
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,130
隆，隆 我就是这样揍他
Boom, boom, I was givin' him. Whang!

926
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,420
你知道吗？我们是一对好伙伴
You wanna know somethin'? We're good sparrin' partners.

927
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,250
你最好知道这一点
You'd better believe it.

928
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:19,210
是，先生
Yes, sir.

929
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:23,930
没有什么能够分开我们.
Nothin' or nobody is ever gonna come between us again.

930
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,430

我的家园

934
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:45,120
看，那是什么？ - 噢，是人类村庄
Look. What's that? - Oh, it's the man village.

935
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,620
不，不，我指的那个
No, no. I mean that.

936
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,920
忘记那些，他们只会给你带来麻烦.
Forget about those. They ain't nothin' but trouble.

937
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:56,480
等一下 我以前从来没有见过
Just a minute. I've never seen one before.

938
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,970
现在你看到了，我们走吧
So you've seen one. So let's go.

939
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,480
我很快就回来，让我好好看看.
I'll be right back.I want a better look.

940
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,150
毛戈力，等一下 - 噢，布鲁
Mowgli, wait a minute - Ah, Baloo.

941
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,160
就让他好好看一下

942
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:20,080
爸爸在林中打猎

妈妈在家中做饭

945
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:31,500
直到有一天我长大成人

946
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:35,330
直到我长大成人

947

直到我长大成人

950
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:09,310
那时我会有个英俊的丈夫

951
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:12,480
和一个我自己的女儿
And a daughter of my own

952
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,480
我会让她来打水

953

我就在家中做饭

那时我派她去打水

955
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:35,950
我就在家中做饭

956
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:45,240
她故意那样做的

957
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,240
很显然是
Obviously.

958
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,490
毛戈力，回来，回来！
Mowgli, come back. Come back!

959
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,300
继续走！继续走！

960
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:53,980
他被迷住了
He's hooked.

961
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,400
哦，这是必然的，布鲁
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.

962
01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:01,410
这孩子已经无法自拔，这是命中注定的
The boy couldn't help himself. It was bound to happen.

963
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,780

我想你是对的

966
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:14,010

967
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,870
好吧，巴吉老伙计

968
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,120
让我们回到属于我们的地方...
Let's get back to where we belong...

969
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,790
跟着节拍...

970
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:25,750
寻找必需品

971
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:28,000
最基本的必需品
The simple bare necessities

972
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:32,080
忘却你的忧虑和矛盾

973
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:34,920
我的意思是最基本的必需品

974
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,210
是自然的力量
Are Mother Nature's recipes

975
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,710
将带来生活最起码的必需品
