我们大战一场
Let's have a little fight.

34
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,380
我才不怕你
You don't scare me.

35
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,450
好好吃的眼球
That's a delicious eyeball.

36
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,810
你是可怕的绿怪物
Ooh, you're big and green and scary.

37
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,770
我最大的恐惧成真了

38
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,440
一定要找到解药
I'm gonna run away.

39

他只是站着一直发抖
He just stood there, shaking.

42
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
好怪哦  他一声也不吭

43
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
一般小孩会哭得死去活来
Any other kid would've wailed his head off.

44
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,900
布鲁斯就是这么地…
That's Bruce. He's like that.

45
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,740
压抑
He's just so... bottled up.

46
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,810
我在实验室找到人类血液样本
The samples we found in your lab... they were human blood.

47

48
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,910
你无权干涉我的实验

49
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
这是我的事
That's my business.

50
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,520
错了  这是政府公事
Wrong, Banner. It's government business

51
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,650
你不准再做实验

88
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,480
你嫌我的安全帽很丑?
You're implying something about my helmet?

89

你活像个呆瓜  谁也没你逊
You look like a massive nerd, even around other scientists.

90
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,810
你被她甩掉那天也戴这玩意吗?
Can I just ask... Were you wearing the helmet while she dumped you?

91
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,680

103
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,190
抱歉  这话太伤人
I'm sorry.That was rude.

104
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,550
没有人说一起工作很容易
Look, nobody expects this to be easy,

105
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,610
毕竟我们从前是那么… 亲密

110
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,370
谁叫我老是找性情冷淡的男友
You're just a by-product of my inexplicable obsession with emotionally distant men.

111
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,410
总有一天我会释怀
I'll get over us.

112
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,950

114
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,620
今天没有好的成果
If we don't get impressive results today,

115
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,880
礼拜二就很难说服他们

116
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,950
那就去干活吧

You wanna go to the review board on Monday and tell 'em...

136
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,000
我们发明杀青蛙的新方法?
we've developed a brand-new method for exploding frogs?

137
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,170
好啊  这一定有市场
Yeah, I think maybe there's a market for it.

I'm just sa... I'm just saying, you know,frogs start falling from the sky,

141
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,210
他们要去找谁?
who do they come to?

142
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,650
我们肯定会一炮而红

I mean, your birth parents.

147
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,930
我永远不会知道
Guess we'll never know.

148
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,580
你怎么一直不想知道他们的事
I don't understand why you don't want to find out about them.

149
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,270
他们早就死了
They're dead.

150
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,840
我什么都不记得他们就死了
They died before I can remember anything.

151
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,210
你为什么一直要追问?
Why do you always come back to this?

152
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,350
不晓得
Don't know.

153
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,880
我猜你的内心一定有什么秘密
I guess I figure there's more to you than you like to show.

154
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,220
你不可能天生就这么冷淡
I guess there couldn't be any less.

155
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,530
绕了半天又回到老问题
Right. So now we come full circle back to that.

156
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,160
你真行
Nice work, Betty.

157
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,280
葛伦
Glen. Hey.

158
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,110
你怎么没穿军服?
What happened to your uniform?

159
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,750
我换了工作
Oh, I, uh... I switched over.

160
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,790
我还是替你父亲做事
I'm still working with your father, but...

161
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,630
不过民间包商的工作更有趣
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting out all the most interesting work, and...

162
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,330
高薪也令人无法抗拒
Can't argue with a paycheck.

163
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,540
我负责基地所有的实验室
I basically run all the labs on the base now.

164
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,610
你看起来不错
you're looking good.

165
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,490
你是遗传工程专家
You're the genetics expert.

166
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,660
啊!大学时光
Ah, the good old college days.

167
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,430
你还好吗?
So, how's business?

168
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,740
你想要什么?
What do you want?

169
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,910
我就直话直说吧
All right, I'll cut to the chase.

170
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,520
听说你的研究工作很有意思
I've been hearing interesting things about what you guys are doing here.

171
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,250
你的分子机器有很多用途
Your little molecular machines have some incredible implications.

172
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,160
你不如到亚矽工作
How would you like to come work for Atheon?

173
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,060
薪水比你现在多十倍
Get paid 10 times as much as you earn now...

174
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,390
你也能拥有专利权
and own a piece of the patents.

175
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,060
你说一个字就行
You just have to say the word.

176
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,530
两个字  出去
Two words: The door.

177
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,130
将军?
General?

178
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,820
进来
Come in.

179
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,860
陶柏要你看这些
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

180
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,470
亚矽想买下一间实验室
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for acquisition

181
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,460
搬到沙漠基地
and removal to desert base.

182
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,860
他怎么不去找国安局?
Why isn't it going through N.S.C.?

183
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,170
这跟你女儿有关
It, uh, concerns your daughter, sir.

184
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,190
班尼呢?
Hey, what happened to Benny?

185
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,360
他不值大夜班啦?
Is he not working the night shift anymore?

186
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,890
他死了  我是新来的工友
Benny's dead.I'm the new guy.

187
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,200
幸会了
Good to meet you.

188
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,100
彼此彼此
 Same.

189
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,000
再拍一张
- Let's try another.

190
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,160
别拍了
Mmm, no. Stay here.

191
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,470
反正我很累
I look tired anyway.

192
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,330
你也很美
Yeah, but you look great.

193
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,060
怎么了?
What's the matter?

194
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,950
我一直在做噩梦
It's these dreams, Doctor.

195
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,710
好可怕哦
I keep having them, and they're terrible.

196
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,120
说来听听
Tell me about your dream.

197
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,450
一开始只是一个记忆
Well, it starts… it starts with a memory

198
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,630
我第一个记忆  那是我…
I think it's my first memory.

199
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,630
两岁大看到的景象
It's this image I have from when I was maybe two years old.

200
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,660
那不只是个梦?
Do you think it's just a dream?

201
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,800
我猜这件事发生在…
No, I think it's something that happened...

202
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,460
我跟我爸住的沙漠基地
when I was living at a desert base with my father.

203
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,170
这场梦继续下去
Anyhow, the dream goes on and...

204
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,240
我突然只有一个人
suddenly I'm alone.

205
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,010
太可怕了  我绝不会伤害你
That's terrible.You know I'd never hurt you.

206
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,580
小狗狗
Hey there.

207
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,150
你叫什么名字?
What's your name, darlin'?

208
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,820
你叫什么?
Eh? What's your name?

209
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,290
好吧  没事了
Okay.It's okay.

210
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,250
我们得谈谈
I gotta talk to you, Edith.

211
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,150
布鲁斯  留在这儿
Bruce, stay here!

212
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,460
C、T、G、A
C... T... G...A

213
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,560
G
G.

214
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,830
布鲁斯
Bruce.

215
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,910
我的布鲁斯
My Bruce.

216
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,960
早  葛伦来拜访
Good morning. Glen dropped by.

217
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,630
他跑来干嘛?
What's he doing here?

218
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,460
柯博士
You know, Dr. Krenzler,

219
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,460
我们一直没正式认识
you and I have never had the chance to get to know each other properly.

220
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,030
正式或非正式我都不想认识你
Well, that's because I don't want to get to know you, properly or improperly.

221
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,670
请你走
So leave.

222
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,210
我这就走
Hey, no worries.

223
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,980
让我先警告你
Let me give you a little heads-up.

224
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,790
善意收购和恶意并构
There is a hairsbreadth between friendly offer...

225
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,490
只有一线之隔
and hostile takeover.

226
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,030
我做过功课
I've done my homework.

227
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,590
你们的研究工作很棒
The work you're doing here is dynamite.

228
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,870
想想看
Think:

229
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,470
美国大兵拥有自我疗伤的能力
Gls embedded with technology that makes them instantly repairable on the battlefield.

230
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,660
专利权在我们手上
in our sole possession.

231
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,970
这是门赚钱的生意
That's a hell of a business.

232
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,640
这不是我们的目的
Well, it's not what we're doing here.

233
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,440
我们只是做科学研究
We're doing the basic science for everyone.

234
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,180
有一天我要写一本书
You know, someday I'm gonna write a book...

235
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,050
穷科学家的愚蠢理想
and I'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists.

236
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,220
你还会再见到我
In the meantime, Bruce, you will be hearing from me.

237
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,750
葛伦的事…
About Glen, I, um...

238
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,770
没什么好说的
There's nothing to talk about.

239
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,820
好吧
Okay.

240
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,950
我只想说别担心  我会处理的
I just wanted to say, don't worry about him... I'll handle it.

241
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,090
怎么处理?
How?

242
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,330
我要打给我爸
I'm gonna call my father,

243
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,560
请他施加压力
ask him to exert some pressure.

244
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,800
你跟你爸不是不说话吗?
Last I heard, you and your father weren't speaking.

245
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,840
我猜我们现在有话可说了
I guess now I have something to talk with him about.

246
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,780
电线好像短路
I think this circuit's kinda fried.

247
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,420
你最好来看看
I don't know. Maybe you wanna come take a look at it.

248
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,890
我马上来
Okay, I'll be right there.

249
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,970
发射伽玛射线

250
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,210
伽玛射线量太高了
The gamma's too high!

251
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,280
我停不下来
Bruce, I can't stop it!

252
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,880
发射

253
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,120
哈普  快出去
Harper, get out!

254
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,150
快出来
Get out!

255
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,790
哈普没事吧?
How's Harper?

256
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,720
没事  你救了他
He's all right.You saved him.

257
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,420
不过他暂时不敢回实验室了
I don't think he's coming back to the lab for a while, though.

258
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,860
我不明白这怎么可能
I don't understand how this is possible.

259
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,370
你应该没命的
You should be dead.

260
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,100
成功了
They worked…

261
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,680
奈米微生物
the nanomeds.

262
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,180
我感觉很棒
I mean, I feel great.

263
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,220
它们把我的伤势治好了
I feel like... I don't know. They must have, like, fixed me.

264
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,380
它们杀死所有的实验对像
Bruce, they've killed everything else that they've come into contact with.

265
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,490
医生有没有…
Are you sure the doctor checked?

266
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,190
他替我做过全身检查
The doctor gave me the full workup.

267
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,660
他想知道我吃了什么仙丹灵药
He wants to know where he can get what I'm taking.

268
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,100
我的元气百分百
I'm a hundred percent.

269
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,790
比百分百更多
More.

270
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,070
什么意思?
What do you mean?

271
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,470
我的膝盖不是受过伤吗?
Remember my bad knee?

272
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,370
现在完全好了
Well, now it's my good knee.

273
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,400
这不好笑
Bruce, this isn't funny.

274
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,950
我看到你  你差点没命
I was watching you.You were gonna die,

275
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,470
我得眼睁睁看着你死
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

276
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,390
贝蒂  对不起
Betty...I'm sorry.

277
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,420
我是说真的
Really.

278
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,420
我不会爆炸啦
Hey, I'm not gonna explode. Okay?

279
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,030
你应该休息一下
You should get some rest.

280
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,570
我真的很好
And I'm fine. Really.

281
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,670
从来没这么好过
I've never felt better.

282
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
你的名字不是柯兹勒
Your name is not Krenzler.

283
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,840
是班纳
It's Banner.

284
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
什么?
What?

285
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,070
你原姓班纳
Your name... it's Banner.

286
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,550
布鲁斯班纳
Bruce Banner.

287
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,160
你是怎么进来的?
Bruce.How did you get in here?

288
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,930
我在这儿工作
I work here now.

289
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,420
我在实验室值大夜班
In the labs. The late shift.

290
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,590
这样才能接近你
It keeps me close to you.

291
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:32,030
你跟罗小姐都工作到很晚
You always work so late yourself with your friend Miss Ross.

292
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,340
别动  让我来
No, no. Please. Please. Let me.

293
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,070
你受了伤
You're not well.

294
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,610
你发生严重的意外
You've had a terrible accident.

295
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,550
你在想你为什么没死
You're wondering why you're still alive.

296
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,290
你身上一定有什么
You're thinking there's something inside.

297
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,020
与众不同
Something different...

298
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,460
无法解释的东西
inexplicable.

299
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,330
我能帮你了解它  如果你愿意
I can help you understand,if you'll let me.

300
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,370
如果你肯…
If you'll...

301
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,770
原谅我
forgive me.

302
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,050
这位先生
Look, mister,

303
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,290
我不知道我要原谅你什么
I'm sure I have nothing to forgive you for.

304
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,990
请你马上离开
So perhaps you should leave now.

305
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,590
我不会有事
I'll be fine.

306
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,690
你一定要知道
You must know.

307
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,970
也许你不信
You may not want to believe it,

308
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,590
但我从你的双眼看得出来
but I can see it in your eyes.

309
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,030
它们跟你母亲的一样
So much like your mother's.

310
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,910
你当然是我的亲生骨肉
Of course, you're my flesh and blood.

311
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,880
不过你也是别的东西
But then, you're something else too, aren't you?

312
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,850
你是我的儿子
My physical son,

313
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,080
也是我的心血结晶
but the child of my mind too.

314
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,550
不  你在说谎
No.You're lying.

315
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,930
我小时候父母就双亡
My parents died when I was a small boy.

316
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,260
不对
No, no, that's not true.

317
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,160
这是他们编的谎言
That's what they wanted you to believe.

318
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,770
那次实验和意外是最高机密
The experiments, the accident... all top secret.

319
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,900
我被关了三十年
They put me away for 30 years.

320
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,200
整整三十年
Thirty years!

321
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,810
远离你
Away from you.

322
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,010
远离我的工作
Away from our work.

323
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,420
但他们不能关我一辈子
But they couldn't keep me forever.

324
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,180
他们得承认我没发疯
After all, I'm sane. They had to admit it.

325
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,620
你要明白  这一切
You see,everything…

326
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,720
这些年来你费尽心思
your extraordinary mind...

327
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,850
寻找的东西
has been seeking all these years...

328
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,420
它就在你的体内
it's been inside you.

329
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,660
现在我们要了解它、掌控它
Now we will understand it.We will harness it.

330
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,580
别接  一定是罗小姐
No, don't answer it. It's Miss Ross again.

331
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,410
你要知道她一件事
There's something you need to know about her, Bruce.

332
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,180
令人不安的事
Something troublesome.

333
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,380
让我保护你
Let me protect you from her.

334
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,680
不  出去
No. Get out.

335
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,260
出去!
- Bruce... - Get out!

336
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,950
坐好
- Sit!

337
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,300
你最好别乱发脾气
We're gonna have to watch that temper of yours.

338
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,920
你真的没事?
You sure you're okay?

339
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,940
没事  能起床真好
Yeah, just glad to be out of bed.

340
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,120
我收到我爸的留言
Got a message from my father.

341
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,990
他要来看我
He's coming to see me.

342
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,660
你爸?
Your father? Mmm.

343
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,250
几时?
When?

344
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,420
他一小时后到
Lands in about an hour.

345
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,600
奇怪的是  他先打给我
The funny thing is, he called me.

346
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,510
嗨  爸爸
Hi, Dad. Hello, Betty.

347
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,280
哈罗  贝蒂

348
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,100
谢谢
You're welcome. Sir? Thank you.

349
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,530
不客气
You're welcome.

350
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,210
我就直话直说吧
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.

351
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,010
这跟葛伦有关  对吧?
It's about Glen, isn't it?

352
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,140
他鬼鬼祟祟跑来我实验室
He's been snooping around my lab.

353
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,320
他看到一些事
Glen noticed some things,

354
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,240
所以请我来收购一下
asked me to make some inquiries.

355
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,790
你是来质问我吗?
Are you here to question me?

356
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,160
不是
No.

357
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,860
我发现一些令人惊讶的事实
We've turned up some surprising things.

358
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,670
你的同事柯兹勒
This Krenzler you work with...

359
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,570
你知道他的真实身份吗?
you know who he really is?

360
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,900
你到底对他了解多少?
How much do you actually know about him?

361
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,710
问题是…
I think the question is,

362
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,940
你对他了解多少?
what is it that you know about him?

363
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,850
我未经授权…
- Well, right now, I'm not... 

364
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,580
你未经授权不能向我透露
Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right. Right.

365
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,790
你知道  我本来希望
You know,I think I was hoping that…

366
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,990
也许这次你是真的想见我
maybe this time you just...honestly wanted to see me again.

367
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,540
你误解了，贝蒂
You've got this all wrong, Betty.

368
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
是吗?
Do I?

369
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,900
是的
Yes.

370
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,670
我是真的想见你
I do want to see you.

371
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,640
我真希望能相信你
I really wish that I could believe you.

372
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,340
柯兹勒血液样本

373
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,570
这些年来你费尽心思
Everything...

374
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,190
寻找的东西
your extraordinary mind has been seeking all these years,

375
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,330
它就在你的体内
it's been inside you.

376
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,830
这是柯博士
Hi, you've called Dr. Krenzler.

377
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,450
请留言  我会尽快回电
Please leave a message and I'll call you right back.

378
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,560
布鲁斯  你在吗?
Bruce, hey. Are you there?

379
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,430
我把事情搞砸了  我爸…
Look, um, I think I screwed up.

380
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,770
他怀疑你做了什么
My father... It's like he suspects you of something. I don't know.

381
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,240
我太没耐心了  没听他说
I was so impatient, like always.I didn't hear him out. I don't know, l…

382
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,410
他们好像在打实验室的主意
I just think that they're planning something with the lab.

383
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,150
打电话给我  再见
So, um, uh...Call me. Okay? Bye.

384
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,960
实验室发生骚动
Dispatch! Dispatch! We have a 415 at the lab!

385
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,550
快派警察过来  快点!
Send Berkeley P.D. Now! Send 'em now!

386
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,650
发生什么事?
David, what's going on?

387
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,890
我们得谈谈
I gotta talk to you, Edith.

388
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,060
布鲁斯  留在这儿
Bruce, stay here.

389
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,430
我的好儿子
My Bruce.

390
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,340
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

391
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,510
实验室发生爆炸
There was some sort of explosion.

392
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,750
他们不让我们进去
They wouldn't let us into the building.

393
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,350
我很担心你
I was worried about you.

394
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,720
我没事
Well, I'm okay.

395
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,760
你昨晚发生什么事?
What happened to you last night?

396
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,430
我做了一场好真实的梦
I had the most vivid dream.

397
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,470
我就像婴儿呱呱落地
It was like being born.

398
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,600
探出头来透气
Coming up for air.

399
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,280
光亮迎面而来  我大声嚎叫
Light hitting my face.Screaming.

400
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,340
心脏猛烈跳动
My heartbeat…it was, like, boom…

401
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,320
一直怦怦响
boom...

402
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,760
你在实验室吗?
Were you at the lab?

403
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,030
不在
No.

404
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,660
但是有什么在
But something...

405
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,170
还有那个人
And there was that man.

406
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,540
牵着狗的那个人
The one with the dogs.

407
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,340
谁?
Who?

408
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,540
新来的工友
That new janitor.

409
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,480
他说他是我爸
He said he was my father.

410
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,180
我去开门
I'll get it.

411
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,270
我爸爸
My father.

412
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,970
真没想到
My, my.

413
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,980
原来你就是布鲁斯班…
So this is the young Bruce Ban...

414
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,550
柯兹勒
Krenzler.

415
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,620
昨晚你在实验室掉了东西
I think you left something in your lab last night.

416
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,600
米契  送我女儿出去

417
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,300
我待会就来
I'll join her shortly.

418
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,510
我要留下来
I'd rather stay here.

419
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,340
快去
Now, Betty.

420
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,770
没关系  我没事
It's okay.I'll be fine.

421
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,250
看好他  我马上回来
Keep him under observation. I'll be back.

422
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,070
什么?
What?

423
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,730
你的朋友
Your friend in there.

424
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,610
很可能被扯进一些危险的事
There's a good chance he's caught up in some very bad business.

425
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,440
一些未了的事
Unfinished business.

426
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,970
我一定要查清楚
And I promise you, I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

427
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,880
我保证会好好照顾他
You have my word I'll make sure he's cared for.

428
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,750
从现在起他被软禁
But as of right now, he is incommunicado.

429
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,120
这几天你最好离他远一点
And for the next few days at least,you're gonna stay away from here.

430
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,220
我这是为了你好
For your own good.

431
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,300
这是新工友的住址?
Okay, and that's for the new guy on the night shift, right?

432
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,970
太好了  感激不尽
Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.

433
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,520
罗博士
Dr. Ross.

434
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,560
真没想到
How unexpected.

435
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,100
请进
Please come in.

436
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:45,140
很抱歉冒昧拜访
I'm sorry to just show up at your house like this.

437
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:52,680
我是来请教一件事
I came to ask you something that...

438
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,510
其实我无权过问
I really have no business asking.

439
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,180
他跟你说了?
He told you?

440
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,090
他说你跟他谈过
He said you talked to him.

441
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,450
请坐
Please sit down.

442
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,630
布鲁斯昨晚在实验室
Bruce was at the lab last night.

443
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:20,680
他说你也在  他不太记得了
He said that you were there too. But he can't remember much about it.

444
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,350
我想知道发生什么事
I need to find out what happened.

445
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,850
你想知道他有哪里不对劲
So, you want to know, uh,what's wrong with him…

446
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,310
然后设法救他
so you can fix him?

447
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,120
把他治好、改变他
Cure him, change him.

448
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,120
我父亲是将军
My father's with the military.

449
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,990
他认为他对国家安全造成威胁
He seems to think he's involved in some kind of threat to national security.

450
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,960
你父亲… 罗斯
Your father. Ross.

451
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,370
你把你爸找来对付他
You brought your father down upon his head?

452
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,180
你什么也不懂
How little you understand, Miss Ross,

453
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,740
你的无知也会造成极大危险
and how dangerous your ignorance has become.

454
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,920
抱歉?
I'm sorry.

455
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,540
别道歉
Don't be sorry.

456
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:07,220
我儿子与众不同
My son is unique.

457
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,060
所以你无法了解他
That's why you can't relate to him.

458
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,000
就因为他与众不同
And because he is unique,

459
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,160
这世界容不下他的存在
the world will not tolerate his existence.Will they?

460
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,760
但是你…
But you…

461
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,510
你试过  对吧?
you try,don't you?

462
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,510
像你这种大美女
Yes.And a very beautiful woman like you,

463
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:42,080
他一定无法抗拒你的魅力
your attentions can't be completely unwanted.

464
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,480
对不对?
Can they?

465
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,290
当然不行
No.

466
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,270
你用水汪汪的大眼睛
Not with eyes like yours,

467
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:57,030
充满爱意地看着他
watching expectantly,lovingly.

468
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,180
但是想帮助他已经来不及了
But I'm afraid we're both too late to help him.

469
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,910
你和我都不能为他做什么
There's nothing I can do for him or for you.

470
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,180
而且
Besides,

471
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,880
他表明不想跟我扯上关系
he's made it clear he wants nothing to do with me.

472
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,650
这是他的选择
His choice.

473
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,720
恕我失陪  我要去忙了
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross, I have some work to do.

474
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,490
别怕那些狗  你不会有事
And don't worry about the dogs.You'll be fine.

475
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,000
只要你不瞪着它们
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.

476
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,610
再见
Good-bye.

477
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,380
他才出来一个月实验室就出事
He gets released, and a month later your lab is destroyed.

478
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,050
真是巧
What a coincidence.

479
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,740
告诉我他人在哪儿
So you're not gonna tell me where he is, are you?

480
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,560
我也很想帮忙  但我不知道
How many times do I have to tell you? I'd like to help you, but I just don't know.

481
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,750
你知道我是谁吧? 班纳
You know who I am. Right, Banner?

482
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,230
你是高阶将领  贝蒂的父亲
Your Betty's father. You're a high-ranking general. 

483
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,430
少装了
Let's cut the crap.

484
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,800
我是把你爸关起来的家伙
I'm the guy who had your father tossed away, and a lot more like him,

485
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,570
有必要我也会把你抓去关起来
and I'll do the same with you if I feel so disposed.

486
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:01,170
是你把他关起来  别问我
You understand? If you had him tossed away, then why are you asking me?

487
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,040
我什么也不记得
I don't remember.

488
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,980
我只知道我爸死了
I was always told my father was dead.

489
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,700
别跟我玩游戏
Don't play with me!

490
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,540
你看到那一切都四岁大了
You were four years old when you saw it.

491
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,220
我看到什么?
When I saw what?

492
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,910
你也在场  怎么会不记得?
You were right there. How could anyone forget a thing like that?

493
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,420
什么?
What?

494
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,880
被压抑的记忆
Oh, some more repressed memories.

495
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,290
请你告诉我
Just tell me.

496
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,190
很遗憾
I'm sorry, son.

497
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,000
你的情况比我想像的更糟
You're an even more screwed-up mess than I thought you'd be.

498
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,540
在查清楚之前
Until we get to the bottom of this,

499
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,850
你的实验室成为机密军事用地
your lab has been declared a top-secret military site...

500
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:47,050
你没有资格回去
and you're not gonna get a security clearance to get back into it...

501
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:50,520
也不能到任何实验室工作
or any other lab that's doing anything more interesting than...

502
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,080
除非你只是研究最新草本发胶
trying to figure out the next generation of herbal hair gel.

503
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,990
还有一件事
One more thing.

504
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:06,000
要是你敢再靠近我女儿一步
If you ever come within a thousand yards of my daughter again,

505
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,900
我就把你抓去关一辈子
I'll put you away for the rest of your natural life.

506
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,450
乖狗狗
Dogs!

507
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,460
去吧
Go!

508
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:31,680
去找她
Go get her!

509
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,320
别让任何人挡路
And let nothing stand in your way!

510
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,760
快去吧
Go!

511
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,430
他们想用同样的方法把你除掉
So, they think they can just throw you away as they did me.

512
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,850
我怎么了?你对我做什么?
What's wrong with me? What did you do to me?

513
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,320
我今天有一个访客
I got a visit today.

514
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,980
不受欢迎的访客
A very unwelcome visit.

515
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,050
我也是逼不得已的
I'm afraid my hand is being forced.

516
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,850
你到底对我做了什么?
What did you do to me?

517
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,220
你很想知道  对吧?
You so much want to know, don't you?

518
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:17,330
但是再多的解释也比不上…
But I think no explanation will serve you half as well...

519
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,060
亲身的体验
as the experience.

520
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,530
何况我自己也不是很清楚
In any case, I still don't quite understand it myself.

521
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,440
当时我只想好好做实验
If they'd only let me work in peace...

522
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,570
他们却不放过我
Of course, my betters would have none of that.

523
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,740
你拿自己做人体实验
So you experimented on yourself, didn't you?

524
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,150
你把什么遗传给我?
And passed on to me... what?

525
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,450
一种改造基因
An alteration. Genetic.

526
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:44,290
我猜你可以说那是种畸形吧
A deformity. I guess you could call it that.

527
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,190
但是也拥有无穷力量
But an amazing strength too.

528
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:51,100
现在它被释放我就能加以利用
And now, finally unleashed, I can harvest it.

529
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,340
不  你不能这么做
No.You'll do no such thing.

530
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,640
我要把它找出来进行治疗
I will isolate it and treat it myself.

531
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,040
趁它没造成伤害杀了它
I'll remove it and I'll kill it before it does any real harm.

532
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,280
你跟你的贝蒂一定很想毁了它
I'll bet you and your Betty would love to destroy it.

533
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,910
但是你能毁了你自己吗?
But would you really destroy part of yourself?

534
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,080
应该不能
I don't think so.

535
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,950
至于贝蒂
And as for Betty,

536
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:16,860
我已经派我的忠犬去拜访她
I'm sending her a surprise visit from some four-legged friends of mine.

537
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:21,370
我培养了你的DNA
You see, I managed to culture some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

538
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,830
效果真的很惊人
and the results are tremendous.

539
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:27,490
虽然不稳定  但是力量强大
They're unstable, but very powerful.

540
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,170
我的DNA怎么了?
What about my DNA?

541
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,750
先看看贝蒂觉得怎么样吧
Let's just wait and see what Betty makes of the results, huh?

542
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:39,680
不行  你疯了  我绝不允许
No. You're crazy.I won't let you.

543
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,750
放开我
Get your hands off of me. Talbot, what's this...

544
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,780
滚进去  我要跟你谈谈
Inside, asshole. I wanna talk to you.

545
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:49,990
我父亲去找贝蒂
Listen, my father's going after Betty...

546
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:53,890
你竟敢背着我找罗斯对付我
What makes you think you can go behind my back and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

547
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,530
听我说  贝蒂有危险
Listen to me! Betty's in trouble!

548
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,510
你这可怜的怪胎
You pathetic freak.

549
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,730
贝蒂会被杀死
Betty's in danger.

550
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,980
我警告你
I swear to you, she'll be killed.

551
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,500
你没有资格来威胁我
I can state the obvious.Something tells me you aren't in much of a position to be making stupid threats to anyone.

552
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,620
陶柏?
Talbot.

553
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,820
干嘛?
Yeah?

554
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,750
你惹我生气了
You're making me angry.

555
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,610
是吗?
Oh, am I?

556
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,510
开枪!
Ohh! Oh!I got him! Open fire!

557
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,650
他派变种狗来找你
Bruce?He sent these dogs, didn't he?

558
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,020
不过我宰了它们
But I killed them!

559
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,020
一定是因为奈米微生物和伽玛射线
My God.It must be the nanomeds. It must be the gamma exposure.

560
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,360
但我们没见过这种效果
But we've never seen any effect like this before.

561
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:19,260
不  另有原因
No. Deeper.

562
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,500
伽玛射线触发了某种东西
The gamma just unleashed what was already there.

563
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,130
触发了什么?
Unleashed what?

564
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,370
我自己
Me.

565
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,670
它
It.

566
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,910
没事
It's okay.Shh. It's okay.

567
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,710
那些动物是什么?
What were those animals?

568
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,310
我爸派来的
My father sent them.

569
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:44,910
他真的是我爸
He is my father.

570
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,850
他要我改变
He wanted me to change.

571
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:51,460
他要我变成可怕的绿巨人
He wanted me to change into that mindless hulk.

572
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,160
为什么?
Why would he want that?

573
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,830
你记得什么吗?
Can you remember anything?

574
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:59,700
在你改变时?
Is there anything from when you were changed?

575
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,230
这就像一场梦
It was like a dream.

576
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,440
梦里有什么?
About what?

577
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,110
愤怒
Rage.

578
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,780
力量
Power.

579
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,310
自由
And freedom.

580
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,810
爸爸?
Hello? Sir.Hello. Dad?

581
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:47,010
贝蒂  你没事吧?
Betty! Are you all right?

582
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:53,060
我好害怕  我需要你的帮忙
I'm scared. I need your help.

583
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,610
你在哪里?
Where are you?

584
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,060
你好吗?
How are you?

585
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,440
还好吧
Okay,

586
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,770
我猜
I guess.

587
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:19,570
你的愤怒启动了奈米微生物
I think that somehow your anger is triggering the nanomeds.

588
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,420
怎么会?
How could it?

589
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,690
它们对肉体伤害才有反应
We designed them to respond to physical damage.

590
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,180
精神伤害也会引起生理反应
Emotional damage can manifest physically.

591
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,480
像是什么?
Like what?

592
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,430
严重的心理创伤
Serious trauma.

593
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,430
被压抑的记忆
Repressed memories.

594
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:51,010
你爸逼问我小时候发生的事
Your father grilled me about something that happened to me from early childhood...

595
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,980
他说我应该记得
that I'm supposed to remember.

596
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,620
是吗?
He did?

597
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,410
听起来很严重
It sounded bad, but...

598
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,120
但是我真的不记得
I honestly don't remember.

599
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,820
我最担心的是
The thing that worries me...

600
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,820
肉体伤害有限
a physical wound is finite,

601
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:15,200
精神伤害却是难以衡量
but with emotions,

602
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,710
很可能引起连锁反应
what's to say it won't just go on and on and start a chain reaction?

603
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,940
你知道我最害怕什么吗?
You know what scares me the most?

604
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,810
当我开始改变
When it happens,when it comes over me…

605
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:33,490
当我无法抗拒、完全失去控制
and I totally lose control,

606
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:37,550
我喜欢那种感觉
I like it.

607
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:58,270
我抱住你了  对不起
It's okay. I got you. I'm sorry.

608
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,810
你没事  这只是麻醉枪
You'll be okay. It's just to make you sleep.

609
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,990
目标倒下
Target down.

610
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:04,480
目标被捕
Target secure.

611
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,650
我要带你到安全地方
I'm going to take you someplace safe.Okay? Bruce?

612
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,200
立正
Clear!Attention on deck.

613
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,570
继续吧
Carry on.

614
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,050
他被我们埋在地底深处
We're buried out here in the middle of nowhere.

615
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,250
你打算把他关多久?
How long are you gonna keep him sedated?

616
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,590
有必要关一辈子
For the rest of his natural life, if I have to.

617
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:20,420
你说我可以相信你
You said I could trust you.

618
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,020
我是你父亲
I'm your father.

619
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,730
我会做我认为是对的事
You can trust me to do what I think is right,

620
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,400
而不是你要我做的事
not what you think you want.

621
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,560
他是个人
He is a human being.

622
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,960
他也是别的东西
He is also something else.

623
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:31,960
假如他逃出去
Suppose he gets out,

624
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,470
在大城市发飙怎么办?
has one of his little mood swings in a populated area.

625
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,740
我知道他很危险
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.

626
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,880
但是他也救了我一命
I'm also aware that he saved my life.

627
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,570
他替你痛宰一只变种贵宝狗
Yeah, from a mutant French poodle.

628
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,210
我真该对他感激涕零
I'm indebted to him for that.

629
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,480
他也把三个人打伤
He also put three men in a hospital,

630
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,020
陶柏也瘸了腿  你要我怎样?
and Talbot's barely walking! What do you want me to do?

631
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,950
我要你帮助他
I want you to help him!

632
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:55,160
你为什么这么怕他?
Why is He such a threat to you?

633
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,290
我了解他的出身
Because I know what He comes from.

634
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:01,900
他身上每一个分子都跟他爸一样
He is his father's son, every last molecule of him.

635
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,060
他说他不认识他爸
He says he doesn't know his father,

636
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:09,170
但是他们却进行相同的研究
but he's workin'in the same exact goddamn field his father did.

637
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,110
如果他不是说谎那就更可怕
So either he's lyin'... or it's somethin' worse, 

638
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,140
因为他…
and he's...

639
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,610
怎么样?
What?

640
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:19,310
命中注定追随他父亲的脚步?
Predestined to follow in his father's footsteps?

641
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,480
我本来想说他受了诅咒
I was gonna say "damned."

642
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,750
当然了
Of course you were.

643
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,720
身为科学家我相信
But I'm a scientist.

644
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:33,230
我能找出原因帮助他
As a scientist, I believe we can figure this out and he can be helped.

645
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,190
我知道
I know you do.

646
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,070
不管你怎么想
Look, whether you know or care,

647
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,770
我都为你所做的感到自豪
I've got a lot of pride in what you've done.

648
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,910
但这件事太危险了
But this is too big for you.

649
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:50,640
我知道政府想利用他当武器
Look, I know the government thinks they have a weapon on their hands.

650
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:53,450
要不然他早就死了
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

651
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,690
他们大可以对他为所欲为
They can probe and prod all they want,

652
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,920
但是也让我帮助他
and in the meanwhile, just let me try to help him.

653
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,320
没有人比我更了解他
Nobody knows him better than I do.

654
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:06,420
大卫班纳对他做了什么?
What did David Banner do to him?

655
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,690
掩护左翼
Cover left! Clear left.

656
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,620
掩护右翼
Cover right!

657
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:27,460
你在干什么?
What's happening here?

658
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,200
我的手
My hand.

659
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:36,000
我儿子DNA的力量
You see, the strength of my son's DNA...

660
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:41,970
结合奈米微生物的再生能力
combined with nanomed reconstruction...

661
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:47,760
让我能溶入任何物体的本质
You see, I can partake with the essences of all things.

662
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:54,390
请你把手举起来
Gonna have to ask you to put your hands up, pal, okay?

663
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,200
慢慢来
Nice and easy.

664
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:08,840
你真以为我们是分开的吗?
Do you really believe that I am separate from you?

665
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:29,050
我在哪里?
Where am I?

666
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,090
你回家了
You're home.

667
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:50,420
不敢相信我们住过这儿
It's hard to believe we used to live here.

668
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,320
我一定见过你  甚至认识你
I must have seen you or known you.

669
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,680
真希望我记得起来
If only I could remember.

670
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,670
走吧
Let's go.

671
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,030
试着回想一下
Please try.

672
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,820
怎么了?
What is it?

673
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,070
没什么
Nothing.

674
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,800
真的吗?
Really?

675
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,240
该死
Damn it.

676
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:31,820
好吧
Okay, Betty...

677
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,820
你想知道什么?
what do you want to know?

678
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:39,730
那间房间有什么?
What was in that room?

679
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,670
你怕我会看到什么?
What are you afraid that I'll see?

680
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:02,540
瞧  什么也没有
See? There's nothing.

681
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,540
空无一物
It's empty.

682
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,700
我为什么不能见他?
What do you mean, I don't have access to him?

683
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:25,540
国安局决定把这个威胁
NSA has decided to turn over study of the, uh...

684
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,230
交给亚矽公司
the threat to Atheon.

685
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,750
你是基地指挥官  你能作主
But you're head of the base.I thought you were in charge.

686
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:35,680
我做不了决策  只能服从命令
But I don't set policy, and I still take orders.

687
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:41,680
我不敢相信陶柏竟然出卖我
I can't believe Talbot would go around me like this!

688
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:47,720
很多有权有势的人都想插一脚
Oh, there's a lot of powerful people that want in on this.

689
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,930
他们可以赚很多钱
And money to be made... lots of it.

690
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,560
你知道最糟的是什么吗?
You know the worst part about all this?

691
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,580
当我把父亲关起来把儿子送走
When I had David Banner locked up and sent that kid away,

692
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,410
我只把他当成一般受害者
I didn't give that boy a second thought; he was just collateral damage.

693
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,210
他不再是了吧!
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

694
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:14,350
我该怎么做?
What can I do?

695
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:18,190
你该回家了
You can go home now.

696
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:22,230
我很想让你跟他道别
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye, but I've already been informed...

697
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:27,360
但是我奉命不准他和外界联系
that for now all further contact is out of the question.

698
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,700
是啊
Hiya,

699
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:10,340
布鲁斯  你好吗?
Bruce. How ya feelin'?

700
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:12,510
这儿的饭好不好吃?
Grub okay in here for ya?

701
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,340
你要什么?
What do you want?

702
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,040
问得好
That's a good question.

703
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:21,750
我需要你的细胞触发化学反应
See, I need your cells to trigger some chemical distress signals.

704
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,420
把你变成那个绿巨人
You know, so you can turn a little green for me again...

705
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:29,260
让我把真正的你大卸八块
and I can carve off a piece of the real you,

706
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,070
分析后申请专利赚大钱
analyze it, patent it, make a fortune.

707
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,160
你不介意吧?
Do you mind?

708
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,100
我不会让你得逞
I'll never let you.

709
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:41,200
你别无选择
I'm not sure you've got much of a choice.

710
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:46,780
你不生气吗?
Come on, Bruce. Aren't you feeling a little angry?

711
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,580
贝蒂弃你不顾  只有我陪你玩
After all, you've only got me to play with now that Betty's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley.

712
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,520
你在说谎
You're lying.

713
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,220
这是双赢的局面
You know, for me this is a win-win situation.

714
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:57,960
你变成绿巨人乖乖等死
You turn green, and all these guys come in and kill you...

715
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,560
让我进行解剖
and I perform the autopsy.

716
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,050
不然的话
- You don't...

717
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:07,260
我就海扁你一顿  掐断你脖子
And I mop the floor with you and maybe by accident go too far and break your neck.

718
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,330
这很不科学
Bad science, maybe...

719
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,170
但是却让我很爽
but personally gratifying.

720
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:18,040
来呀  看你有什么能耐
Come on, Bruce! Let's see what you got.

721
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:20,640
不要
Never.

722
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,980
你也许能用意志力控制
but subconsciously,

723
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,590
但是你却控制不了潜意识
I bet that's another story.

724
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,450
刺激他的脑波吧
All right, let's jump-start those brain waves.

725
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,320
亲爱的罗小姐  欢迎回家
My dear Miss Ross. Welcome back.

726
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:39,390
外面有两名守卫
There are two guards right outside.

727
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:44,767
别担心，我已经不再生你的气了
You don't have to worry. I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.

728
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:44,390


729
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:47,070
你要什么?
What do you want?

730
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:50,230
我这一生已经完了
It's over for me now. I know that.

731
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,940
布鲁斯也快完了
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.

732
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:56,610
所以我才来找你
That's why I've come to you...

733
01:27:56,610 --> 01:28:00,770
请你说服你父亲
to ask you if you could persuade your father,

734
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,510
请他以一个父亲的角度考虑
as a man, as a father himself,

735
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:08,720
我愿意乖乖自首
that if I turn myself in now, peacefully...

736
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,820
在他把我关一辈子之前
and before he puts me away forever,

737
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:16,990
请他让我见我儿子最后一面
that he would let me see my son for one last time.

738
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:19,730
你能帮我这个忙吗?
Could you do that for me?

739
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,370
现在我爸也不能作主
It's out of my father's hands now.

740
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:34,080
我明白  他也成为傀儡
I understand. He's a puppet now.

741
01:28:35,058 --> 01:28:37,322
-我不会怪他   -你也不应该
-I don't blame him.  -You shouldn't.


742
01:28:37,394 --> 01:28:41,160
你应该对你儿子做的事情感到愧疚
You should blame yourself for what you've done to your son.




744
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,790
罗小姐，我对我儿子做什么了？
And what have I done to my son, Miss Ross?

745
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:45,990
什么也没做
Nothing.

746
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:50,060
我只不过尽力想改善我自己
I tried to improve on the limits in myself.

747
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,770
是我自己  不是他
Myself!  Not him!

748
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:54,860
你能了解吗?
Can you understand?

749
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,590
违反自然定律
To improve on nature.

750
01:28:56,591 --> 01:28:59,370
我的自然本质，对自己的认知
My nature!  Knowledge of oneself!

751
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:02,078
这是追求真理唯一的道路
It's the only path to the truth...

752
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:06,950
让人类挣脱上帝的束缚
that give men the power to go beyond God's boundaries!

753
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:11,420
但是你不能为了自己牺牲别人
You know what's beyond your boundaries? Other people.

754
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:15,150
你只为布鲁斯带来恐惧
All you've given Bruce is fear.

755
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:18,950
对生命的恐惧
Fear of life.

756
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,630
恐惧?
Fear?

757
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:27,600
也许吧
Perhaps, Miss Ross.

758
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:31,700
还有孤独
And loneliness too.

759
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,470
两者我都经历过
Yes... I feel them both.

760
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:45,350
但是我也曾拥有幸福
But I have lived... completely once.

761
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,720
我深爱我的妻子
I was so much in love,

762
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:53,490
她也很想要一个小孩
and she so much wanted a baby.

763
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,220
我的小孩
My baby.

764
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:05,970
她一怀孕我就知道
I could tell from the moment she conceived...

765
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:10,640
那不是个儿子  是别的东西
that it wasn't a son I had given her but something else.

766
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:13,480
也许是一个怪物
A monster, maybe.

767
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,350
我早该结束他的生命
I should have put a stop to it right then,

768
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:18,280
但是我很好奇
but I was curious

769
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:20,910
那也是我的沉沦
and that was my downfall.

770
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,230
当我看着小生命逐渐成长
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,

771
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:28,390
就想到他长大后会有多痛苦
I began to imagine the horror of it,

772
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:35,200
我的好奇心被慈悲心取代
and my curiosity was replaced with compassion.

773
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:40,440
但是他们不让我治好他
But they took away my chance to cure him.

774
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,880
你父亲把我关起来
Your father threw me out.

775
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,850
那一天我记得很清楚
what are you doing?   I remember that day so well...

776
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,580
每一刻、每一种感觉
every moment, every sensation...

777
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,620
我走进屋子
walking into the house,

778
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:55,110
手里拿着刀的触感
the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand.

779
01:30:55,120 --> 01:31:00,460
我身为父亲必须结束他的痛苦
I knew I was doing a father's work, fulfilling a father's mercy.

780
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,360
大卫  住手
David, please stop it! No!

781
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,760
大卫  听我说
David, no! Talk to me! Listen!

782
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:09,100
但是她让我吓一跳
But then she surprised me.

783
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:21,480
好像…   她和那把刀
It was as if..    she and the knife...

784
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,620
合而为一
merged.

785
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:34,860
不
No!

786
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:41,890
你无法想像我有多绝望
You cannot imagine the unbearable finality of it.

787
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,770
就在那一瞬间
And in that one moment...

788
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:49,240
我夺走我所爱的一切
I took everything that was dear to me...

789
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:56,250
心中一片空虚  剩下痛苦回忆
and transformed it into nothing more than a memory.

790
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:15,030
太好了  他做了可怕的噩梦
Bingo! That must be some jumbo nightmare he just had.

791
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,800
动手  开始抽取酵素
Okay, do it now. Start the enzyme extraction.

792
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:29,250
刺不进去
Sir, negative on drill penetration.

793
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,420
那就用力  使用全力
Damn it, drill him harder! Give him full RPMs.

794
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,350
加油
Come on, Holeman! Come on!

795
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,540
杀了他吗?
Should I neutralize?

796
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,940
不  杀了他就没用
No! I can't do anything with goop! Come on!

797
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,080
把他麻醉
All right, put him to sleep.

798
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:17,920
一点都没有用
It's not stopping him!

799
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:27,140
派出我们的危机小组
Ready room, send in our containment team.

800
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,740
使用非致命武器
Non-lethals only. I repeat, non-lethals only.

801
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:32,080
我一定要采到他的样本
I must have a sample of him.

802
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,610
长官
Sir!

803
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,580
天啊
Jesus!

804
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,420
用泡沫喷他
Hit him with the foam.

805
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,110
强力化学泡沫
Deploy containment foam.

806
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,150
陶柏  快回答
Talbot, talk to me.

807
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,430
我控制住了  有必要再通知你
Cease fire! Under control, General. I'll let you know if we need you.

808
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:52,100
不行  我要你马上离开
Unacceptable. Unseat your asses down here immediately.

809
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:55,200
全员撤退  终止你的行动
I want a full-court evacuation now.

810
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,640
全面封锁
I'm shutting you down. Lockdown.

811
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,210
你没听到将军的话?
Didn't you hear what the general said?

812
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:00,070
我说全面封锁
I said lockdown!

813
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:05,310
让开  我要他的样本
Clear! I need a sample of him!

814
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:10,440
放轻松  老兄
Take it easy there, buddy.

815
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:13,580
这可能会有点痛
This might give you a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

816
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,440
退后!
Fall back! Fall back! Clear your weapon! Clear it!

817
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,310
退下去  给我M2弹
Give me the M2. 

818
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:33,430
永别了  大家伙
So long, big boy.  

819
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,150
立刻全面封锁
Lockdown the entire facility immediately.

820
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:53,260
全面封锁

821
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,860
目标移向蓝层
Target's still moving towards blue level.

822
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:57,590
把大厅疏散
Evacuate the main hall.

823
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,910
派人带重型武器进去，一级警戒
Send in backup, heavy weapons. Issue general quarters.

824
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:07,870


825
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,830
辐射污染  系统发出警讯
Contamination, sir. System readings are redline.Data's on backup power supply.

826
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:47,740
小心了
Incoming!

827
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,950
切断大厅电源
-Shut down all power to the main hall.   -Sir?

828
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:01,820
让他出去  到外面对付他
Show him the way out. We'll fight him outside.

829
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:14,490
停  停下来
Driver, stop. Driver, stop.

830
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:24,300
炮兵  炮管向右
Gunner, traverse left! Traverse left!

831
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,860
总统先生  我有坏消息
Mr. President, I have some bad news, sir.

832
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:08,580
说吧
Let's have it, General.

833
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:10,340
总统知道代号"怒汉"的事
I've briefed the president on Angry Man.

834
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:12,110
我猜是这件事吧
I assume that's what this is about.

835
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,410
是的
It is, ma'am.

836
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:16,780
我要求行使作战指挥权
I'm requesting a National Command Authority override.

837
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:19,650
怒汉失去控制
Angry Man is unsecure.

838
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:24,450
我要动用所有武力阻止他
I need everything we have at my disposal in order to stop his movement.

839
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:27,480
他会造成老百姓伤亡吗?
You're expecting civilian casualties, General?

840
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:29,790
我会尽全力阻止他
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

841
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,230
我同意  继续报告
Consider it done. Keep us posted.

842
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:23,120
通知古曼基地
Contact Goodman Control.

843
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:27,490
调派战斗直升机  连络总部
Patch data to the assets.Contact H.Q.

844
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:31,550
请他们立刻疏散
Have them initiate an immediate evacuation...

845
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,250
座标653-216区域
in vicinity of grid coordinates 653-216...

846
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:14,190
请确认该区完全疏散
Confirm that the area has been cleared.

847
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:19,070
该区已疏散  并锁定目标
Confirm area cleared.H.Q. Confirms area cleared. Assets on-line, sir.

848
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:21,480
各位  进攻吧
Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.

849
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:24,910
我要目标停止行动
I want this target stopped in his tracks.

850
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:16,690
天啊
Jesus.

851
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:34,170
求救!求救!
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

852
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,590
探戈四号被打落
Tango Four is down.

853

派出搜救小组
Have C-SAR respond to our 20 ASAP.

854
01:43:46,190 --> 01:43:48,900
快把他引开
We're okay, but, damn it, get him off us before he tears us apart!

855
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,860
我打不到他  你能瞄准吗?
I've got no shot. Do you have a clear line of fire?

856
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:53,970
小心
Watch it, Tango Flight.

857
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:56,270
快向左飞
Break left! Break left!

858
01:43:57,910 --> 01:44:00,470
我要发射地狱火飞弹
Tango Three, pull back and set up for a Hellfire shot.

859
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:02,910
等我们把他引开再发射
Hold your fire till we draw him off.

860
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:05,480
探戈一号准备开火
Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.

861
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,640
收到  准备发射

862
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,880
发射飞弹
Engage at will.

863
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,970
退后  让我发射
Tango One, pull back! Clear my line!

864
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:41,640
让开  我瞄准目标了
Tango Flight, clear back.

865
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,710
好了  开火吧
Tango One, Tango Three. I have contact.

866
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:08,010
我射中他了
I've got him painted for Hellfire.

867
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,340
天啊  他接到我的飞弹
Holy shit! He's got my missile!

868
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,380
求救!
Mayday! Mayday!

869
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:20,150
求救  我被击落了
Mayday! Mayday! We're hit! We're going down!

870
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,590
有没有人伤亡?
Give me a head count.Tango Three, give me a sit rep.

871
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,860
直升机被击落  无人伤亡
Our kite's busted up, but we're okay.

872
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:36,440
你们看到目标吗?
Tango Flight, do you have eyes on the target?

873
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,010
他在岩石堆
Tango One. I have him in the rocks.

874
01:45:39,010 --> 01:45:41,840
全力开火  把它移为平地
Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.

875
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,960
它被移为平地了
T-bolt, your parking lot is ready.

876
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:08,030
油量不够  返回基地
We're bingo for fuel and ammo. R. T.B.

877
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:39,530
指挥官  目标没被摧毁
T-bolt, this is Goodman Control.Be advised, target not destroyed.

878
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:41,130
他又在移动
He's on the move again.

879
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:42,630
可恶
Damn!

880
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,340
找到他了
I've got it.

881
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:47,600
看来他要回家
It appears he's heading home.

882
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:52,510
出动战机  拦截目标
Launch fast movers.Have them intercept and engage.

883
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,290
布鲁斯逃出来了
Betty, Bruce got out.

884
01:46:58,290 --> 01:47:01,310
他往你那儿去  大概是去找你
He's headed your way and probably right for you.

885
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,320
你离基地多远?
How far from the base are you?

886
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:06,520
我到了  他们把他爸带来
I'm already here. They're taking his father in now.

887
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:10,620
这是好消息  待在那儿 贝蒂
That's all good news. Stay there, Betty.

888
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,570
旧金山柏克莱

889
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:28,050
传奇一号和二号急速接近中
Legend One rolling in hot. Legend Two breaking off left.

890
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:30,980
我要折回来进行攻击
I think I can come back around for a gun attack.

891
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:34,820
瞄准目标就开火
Acquire a clear target. Fire at will.

892
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:42,020
是民航机  快爬升

893
01:47:47,530 --> 01:47:50,400
快拉高  你会撞到大桥
Pull up! Pull up! You're headed for the bridge!

894
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:53,800
我拉不高
I can't pull up! I can't pull up!

895
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:06,150
把他载到大气层外
Okay, you've got him now. Take him on a ride to the top of the world.

896
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:08,420
让他吸不到空气
Let's see what the thin air will do for him.

897
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,820
启动后燃引擎
Initiating afterburner.

898
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,510
爬升到六万英尺高度
I'm passing flight level 600.

899
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:33,480
我到了极限
This is out of my envelope.

900
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:35,450
撑着点
Hang in there, Legend.

901
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:38,650
他抓得太紧  无法维持高度
I can't maintain. He's all over my aerodynamics.

902
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:41,090
他会比你先昏过去
He'll lose consciousness before you.

903
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:46,420
九万五千英尺
Nine-fifty.

904
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:50,200
我撑不下去了  我要下降
I can't hold it. I'm pulling back!

905
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:39,310
卑微的人类
Puny human.

906
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:51,550
他坠入大海  准备开火
Contact. He's in the water. All units, weapons hot.

907
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:56,360
不能冒险  全力开火
Let's not take any chances.You are cleared to fire on target, Legend.

908
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:24,830
我别无选择  一定要消灭他
Dad? Betty?We don't have a choice.I have to destroy him.

909
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:26,260
你不能这么做
But you can't.

910
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:29,560
把他激怒只会让他更强壮
You will only fuel his rage, and you will make him stronger.

911
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:33,360
他是去找你的
It's you he's coming for. You know that.

912
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,100
那就让我去找他
Then let me go to him.

913
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:39,440
求求你
Please.

914
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,670
给他机会冷静下来
Just give him a chance to calm down.

915
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:08,440
旧金山领空的民航机
All aircraft vicinity of San Francisco, this is T-bolt on guard.

916
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:12,010
这区域是飞行禁区
This area has been declared restricted airspace.

917
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:15,670
所有飞行物必须立刻撤离
All aircraft are ordered to clear the airspace immediately.

918
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:00,750
锁定目标  准备开火
Echo, One-niner. Weapons are hot.

919
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:04,690
等待攻击指令
Target acquired. Waiting your orders to engage.

920
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,420
准备开火  等候指令
Repeat, waiting your orders to engage.

921
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:20,270
所有单位，停止开火
All units, hold your fire.

922
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:23,480
这里是指挥，所有单位停止射击
This is T-bolt to all assets. You have
direct orders to holdyourfire.

923
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,970
重复一遍，停止射击
I repeat, holdyour fire.

924
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:58,130


925
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,730
你找到我了
You found me.

926
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:36,100
你并不难找
You weren't that hard to find.

927
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:40,170
我很难找
Yes, I was.

928
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:21,510
大家听好了
Let's take a walk.

929
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:23,750
他要留在基地
That's the deal, gentlemen. He stays on this base...

930
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:27,050
直到我接到命令再处置他
until we get the final word from C-3 on how to dispose of him.

931
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:31,080
要是他敢轻举妄动
In the meantime, if he does anything but sit there in that chair,

932
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:36,490
就开启电源把他烧焦
we're gonna turn on the juice and he'll be incinerated immediately.

933
01:56:36,730 --> 01:56:39,700
建立两百码的保护范围
We've established a 200-yard perimeter, sir.

934
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:42,040
要是启动电磁波
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,

935
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:44,090
应该不会伤及无辜
there should be no collateral damage.

936
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,910
我是为了你才这么做
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

937
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:59,520
但是我们要有最坏的打算
But one way or another, we're gonna have to prepare for the worst.

938
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:50,830
我应该杀了你
I should have killed you.

939
01:58:52,170 --> 01:58:54,330
我也早该杀了你
And I should have killed you.

940
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:57,460
真希望你杀了我
I wish you had.

941
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,500
我昨晚看到她
I saw her last night.

942
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:09,340
我看到她的脸
Saw her face.

943
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:11,910
棕发
Brown hair.

944
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:15,280
棕眼
Brown eyes.

945
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,450
她对我笑
She smiled at me.

946
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:22,420
低下头亲我的脸颊
She reached down and kissed my cheek.

947
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:26,860
我几乎能闻到她的味道
I can almost remember a smell.

948
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,970
就像沙漠花朵
Almost like desert flowers.

949
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:37,140
她最爱擦的香水
Her favorite perfume.

950
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:44,540
我连我妈妈的名字都不知道
It's my mother, and I don't even know her name.

951
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:54,890
没关系  尽管哭吧
It's all right, son. You go ahead and cry.

952
01:59:54,890 --> 01:59:56,450
大声地哭吧
Go ahead and cry.

953
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,610
哭一哭对你也好
Cry. Crying will do you good.

954
02:00:11,610 --> 02:00:13,100
别碰我
Don't touch me!

955
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,180
也许你以前是我父亲
Maybe once you were my father,

956
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:21,780
但是现在和以后都不是
but you're not now and you never will be.

957
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:23,840
是吗?
Oh, is that so?

958
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,750
让我告诉你
Well, I got news for you.

959
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:30,720
我不是来见你的
I didn't come here to see you.

960
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:34,230
我是来见我的儿子
I came here to see my son.

961
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:37,240
我真正的儿子
My real son.

962
02:00:37,470 --> 02:00:39,870
在你体内的东西
The one inside of you.

963
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:43,840
你只不过是一个空壳子
You're nothing but a superficial shell,

964
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,750
你薄弱的意识
a husk of flimsy consciousness...

965
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:50,120
在一瞬间就会消失殆尽
ready to be torn off at a moment's notice.

966
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:53,610
随便你  我不在乎  快走吧
You can think what you like. I don't care. Just go!

967
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:03,050
听我说  我找到解药
No, son. Listen to me. I found a cure.

968
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:04,900
治好我的解药
For me.

969
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:08,470
我的细胞也能突变
My cells can transform too,

970
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:11,300
吸收大量的能量
absorb enormous amounts of energy.

971
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:13,860
但是却不稳定
But, unlike you, they're unstable.

972
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:17,800
儿子  我需要你的力量
Son, I need your strength.

973
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:21,450
我赐给你生命
I gave you life.

974
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:24,640
你该给我回报了
Now you must give it back to me!

975
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:30,710
比以往强大一百万倍
Only a million times more radiant, more powerful!

976
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:32,060
住手
Stop it.

977
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:36,050
为什么?
Stop? Stop what?

978
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:41,200
你想想外面那些穿军服的人
Think about all those men out there in their uniforms...

979
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:44,600
只会盲目地服从命令
barking and swallowing orders,

980
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:48,470
以武力统治全世界
inflicting their petty rule over the entire globe!

981
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:51,240
他们造成了多大的伤害
Think of all the harm they've done!

982
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,240
对你!对我!
To you! To me!

983
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:56,510
对全人类!
To humanity!

984
02:01:57,050 --> 02:02:00,990
我们可以让他们的国旗、国歌
And know this... that we can make them...

985
02:02:00,990 --> 02:02:05,390
和他们的政府永远消失
and their flags and their anthems and their governments disappear in a flash!

986
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:07,430
只要你我合而为一
You in me.

987
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:09,160
我死也不肯
I'd rather die.

988
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,730
这就是你的回答?
Oh, that's your answer?

989
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:18,340
那你真的应该死后重生
Then indeed you shall die... and be reborn...

990
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:24,000
成为在文明污染人类灵魂之前
a hero... of the kind that walked the earth...

991
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:29,180
傲视地球的英雄人物
long before the pale religions of civilization infected humanity's soul!

992
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:32,280
滚!
Go!

993
02:02:47,070 --> 02:02:48,900
别哭了
Stop your bawling,

994
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:52,600
你这没有用的人渣
you weak little speck of human trash.

995
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:02,470
我这就走
All right... I'll go!

996
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,850
你就看着我走吧
- You just watch me go! - Hit it.

997
02:03:05,850 --> 02:03:07,150
通电
Hit it.

998
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:34,300
再试一次
- Hit it again!

999
02:03:34,750 --> 02:03:36,480
不行  没电了
We can't, sir. There's no power. Some kind of counter-electromagnetic field.

1000
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,970
有一股逆向电磁场
Move in and assault the target. Move in!

1001
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:45,620
摧毁目标  快去
Move, move, move!

1002
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:40,000
我找到他们  在梨子湖
Sir, I've located them on radar. Pear Lake.

1003
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,350
通知伽玛弹小组
Call up the task force.

1004
02:04:49,690 --> 02:04:51,660
很好
Yes!

1005
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:59,350
这就对了  继续抗拒
That's right. Keep fighting.

1006
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:04,000
你越抗拒我吸收的能量就越多
The more you fight, the more of you I take.

1007
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:13,540
奇怪
Strange.

1008
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:16,470
温度急速下降
We're reading a phenomenal drop in temperatures there.

1009
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:19,140
同时有放射性活动
But simultaneous radiological activity.

1010
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:21,650
他们在吸收周围的能量
They're absorbing all the ambient energy.

1011
02:06:32,190 --> 02:06:35,660
沉睡吧   布鲁斯 遗忘一切
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.

1012
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:37,830
别再挣扎了
Struggle no more...

1013
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:41,090
把力量全都给我
and give me all of your power.

1014
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:46,040
你承受得了就拿去吧
You think you can live with it? Take it!

1015
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:49,140
全都拿去
Take it all!

1016
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:55,510
很好  很好
Oh, yes! Yes!

1017
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:10,760
拿回去
Take it back!

1018
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,590
停不下来了
It's not stopping!

1019
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:18,360
快拿回去
Take it back!

1020
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:37,650
各位  发射伽玛弹
Gentlemen... release.

1021
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:46,920
发射伽玛弹
Gamma charge away.

1022
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,760
祝好梦
- Mwah! - Sweet dreams.

1023
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:35,640
一年后

1024
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:09,910
-你好  -贝蒂?是你吗?
Hello? Betty, is that you?

1025
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:11,410
嗨  爸
Hi, Dad.

1026
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:12,850
很高兴找到你
I'm glad I caught you.

1027
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:14,350
很高兴你打来
I'm glad you called.

1028
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:15,720
谢谢
Thanks.

1029
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:21,150
贝蒂  你跟我…
Look, Betty... you and I...

1030
02:09:22,190 --> 02:09:25,820
我们都知道布鲁斯活不了
well, we both know that Bruce couldn't have survived that blast.

1031
02:09:27,170 --> 02:09:29,900
不过要是你…
But... well, you know...

1032
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:32,890
怎么了?
What is it? 

1033
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:35,770
你也知道  世上有很多疯子
Well, you know.The usual loonies. Seein' things.

1034
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:39,840
他们到处都看到绿巨人
Only now everything's green.

1035
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:42,810
是啊
Right.

1036
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,180
听我说
Look, uh...

1037
02:09:46,350 --> 02:09:49,510
要是他真的没死
if by some chance he did survive...

1038
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:54,350
当他试着跟你联络
and he should try to contact you, try to get in touch,

1039
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:57,090
你会告诉我吧?
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1040
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:01,820
我不会
No... I wouldn't.

1041
02:10:02,870 --> 02:10:06,210
我也不需要
But you know as well as I do, I wouldn't have to.

1042
02:10:06,210 --> 02:10:09,940
我的电话被窃听、电脑被监控
I mean, my phones are bugged, my computer's tapped.

1043
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:12,000
一举一动都被监视
I'm under surveillance.

1044
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:16,040
老实说
I'll tell you, though,

1045
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:19,480
假如他还活着
that if he were alive,

1046
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:22,420
我最不希望他来找我
I'm  the last person I would want him to come to...

1047
02:10:22,422 --> 02:10:26,050
尽管我很想他
because... as much as I miss him,

1048
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:30,990
我...我...我爱他
I... I... Ioved him.

1049
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:39,260
贝蒂，我很抱歉
I'm sorry, Betty.

1050
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:43,370
我非常抱歉
I am so sorry.

1051
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:47,840
我知道
I know you are.

1052
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:24,980
听爸爸的话乖乖吃药
[Man SpeakingSpanish ]

1053
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:41,400
把药都拿走

1054
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:44,090
闭嘴

1055
02:11:44,970 --> 02:11:46,210
坐下来

1056
02:11:46,210 --> 02:11:47,690
闭嘴

1057
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:54,010
这些药是给当地居民的

1058
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:57,540
你懂个什么屁?

1059
02:11:57,580 --> 02:12:01,180
他们在帮助敌人

1060
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:05,190
也许你也一样

1061
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:07,080
通通拿走

1062
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:10,420
这全是政府的

1063
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,330
你惹我生气了

1064
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:18,960
你不会喜欢看见我生气的样子的！

1065
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,440
 

1066
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,440
 

1067
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1068
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
