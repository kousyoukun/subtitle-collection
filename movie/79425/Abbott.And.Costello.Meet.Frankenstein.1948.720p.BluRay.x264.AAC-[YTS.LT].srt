1
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,299
Operator, haven't you been able to get me the express office

2
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,134
at Islamorada, Florida yet?

3
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,639
Yes, I know it takes time to call from London to the States.

4
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,558
But please hurry. It's terribly important!

5
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,102
Answer that phone.

6
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,313
Answer the bell!

7
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,315
Answer the phone!

8
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,318
Which do you want me to answer first?
Both of 'em.

9
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,738
Both of 'em. Both of 'em!

10
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,784
Hold the line, please. Thank you.

11
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,119
I'd like to have my grip, please.
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,748
Let me see that. Well, they came in on the last train.

13
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,501
We haven't unloaded the truck yet. Go out and get the lady's grip.

14
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,295
Hurry up.

15
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,382
Excuse me... Excuse me, please.

16
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,436
Lady, here's your bag.

17
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,067
What are you trying to do, ruin the lady's baggage?

18
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,027
Where is it?
This one.

19
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,196
There you are, Madam. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

20
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,699
Now come on, clean this all up. Come on, straighten it out.

21
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,076
Wilbur, darling, are you all right?

22
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,163
Sandra, I hurt my poor little head.

23
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,040
Your head?

24
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,293
Oh, no.

25
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,546
Does this hurt?
Uh-uh.

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,882
Does that hurt?
Uh-uh.

27
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,508
Thank heaven.

28
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:42,471
If anything happened to you, dearest, I'd never forgive myself.

29
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,850
That kiss made everything all better.

30
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,227
You worry about me an awful lot, don't you?

31
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,813
You mean an awful lot to me.

32
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,231
Tell me more.

33
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,108
I will. At dinner tonight.

34
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,192
Okay.

35
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,864
Come on, get up out of there and go to work!

36
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,033
That is, if your head doesn't bother you too much.

37
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,036
His head is all right.
It is, eh? But is your head all right?

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,663
Certainly.
Frankly, I don't get it.

39
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,832
And frankly, you never will.

40
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,503
I can't understand that dame.

41
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,382
Of all the guys around here, that classy dish has to pick out a guy like you.

42
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,427
What's wrong with that?
Go look at yourself in the mirror sometime.

43
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,678
Why should I hurt my own feelings?

44
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,225
Go answer the phone. Go ahead, I'll pick these up.

45
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,481
Baggage room.

46
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,525
London? Calling here?

47
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,612
This ain't collect, is it?

48
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,031
Oh, all right. Put him on.

49
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:47,536
Hello? Do you have two crates addressed to the McDougal House of Horrors?

50
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,164
What's the number on the checks?
Never mind that.

51
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,584
Tonight, the moon will be full here. I haven't much time.

52
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,046
Now, listen closely. I'm flying out of here at dawn.

53
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,217
Under no circumstances are you to deliver those crates until I arrive.

54
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,302
Understand? Under...

55
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,482
Mr. McDougal, will you stop gargling your throat?

56
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,550
Hey, you'll have to get your dog away from the phone.

57
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,593
I can't hear a word you're sayin'.

58
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,516
You're awful silly to call me all the way from London,

59
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,851
just to have your dog talk to me.

60
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,196
That's great conversation. The guy growls like a wolf.

61
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,073
The nerve of some people!

62
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,616
Well, what can I do for you, bub? I'm in a hurry.

63
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,910
I have two crates here addressed to my House of Horrors,

64
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,621
and I want immediate delivery. My name's McDougal.

65
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,707
McDougal? But, I just talked to you on the telephone from London.

66
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,542
How'd you get here so fast? They shoot you out of a cannon?

67
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,544
Are you crazy? I've been here all the time.

68
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,879
Now, get me those crates!

69
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,255
How long you been here?
Five minutes.

70
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,798
What are you beefing about? I've been here five years,

71
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,341
you don't see me going around like that and yelling...

72
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,635
There's the insurance slip and there's the bill of lading.

73
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,679
Now get me those crates!

74
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,639
Look, will you please stop yellin'?

75
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,642
Come here. You know, it's impolite to raise your voice.

76
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,186
Oh, Chick!

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,812
Why didn't you give me these in the first place?

78
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,648
Chi... Chick, this man wants these crates.

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,027
Hmm. Insured for $20,000. We'd better look these up.

80
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,779
Must be valuable.
I'll say they're valuable.

81
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,781
Wilbur?
Yes, Sandra?

82
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,616
He's busy, he's busy. Please.

83
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,494
That little fellow's impossible. Hurry up with those crates!

84
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,748
Do you know what I've got in there, miss?
Haven't the slightest idea.

85
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,667
Just the greatest attraction the House of Horrors ever had, that's all.

86
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,047
One of them's a coffin containing the remains of the original Count Dracula.

87
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,550
And the other's the body of the Frankenstein Monster.

88
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,887
Guess that combination's enough to scare the pants...

89
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,056
I mean, shirt right off your back, ain't it?

90
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,017
I don't scare easily.
Neither do I, where money's concerned.

91
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:19,396
I got 'em dirt cheap. European agent picked my name right out of thin air.

92
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,940
Very interesting.
Yeah.

93
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,777
Mr. McDougal.

94
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,947
Hey, Chick, here's one.

95
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,740
Darling...
Yeah?

96
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,867
Darling, I have to run along. Something's come up.

97
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,328
That means we'll have to break our date tonight.

98
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,414
It ain't another man, is it?
Of course not.

99
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,125
Silly boy.
Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,674
Boy, I'm floatin' on a cloud of love.

101
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,217
Listen, you little blimp,

102
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,845
I'll let the air out of you in a minute, if you don't give me a hand.

103
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,598
You understand that?
Thank you.

104
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,226
Boy, is this kid lost.

105
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,687
Come here. Take that rope and get up on top that box,

106
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,855
and tie it to that handle up there.

107
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,898
Okay. Nothing matters no more.

108
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,694
I'm so happy.
Go on, get up there!

109
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,078
Here it is.

110
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,707
Hold still now.

111
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,667
Oh!

112
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,379
Chick!

113
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,339
Stop him! Is he trying to ruin me?

114
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,175
Keep your shirt on. You're insured.

115
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,386
Yes, and if those exhibits are damaged, I intend to collect.

116
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,144
Well, there you are. Shall I wrap it up?
No, you idiot.

117
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,063
You're gonna take those down to my House of Horrors and uncrate them.

118
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,607
Because if that's the way you handle baggage,

119
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,859
I'm going to have the insurance agent there to inspect them

120
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,319
before I accept delivery.

121
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,197
Well, then it's gonna cost you overtime because I'm a union man.

122
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,073
And I work only 16 hours a day.

123
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,534
A union man only works eight hours a day.

124
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,204
I belong to two unions!

125
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,084
Get those down to my place!
All right.

126
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,553
Hey, Wilbur, here's a key. Open the door.

127
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,406
I'm not gonna like this.
Come on, gimme a hand.

128
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,909
Come on, get it inside.

129
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,245
Well, pull it! You want me to do all the work?

130
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,501
Come on, help me with it, will ya?

131
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,756
Oh...

132
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,299
What's the matter now?

133
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,802
Somebody's got a knife in my back.
Oh, nonsense!

134
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,513
Where's the switch? Here.

135
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,600
Sandra should see you now.

136
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,354
Turn around. Look what you're afraid of.

137
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,647
Turn around!

138
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,323
Come on, get up on your feet. It's only a dummy.

139
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,701
Dummy nothin'. It was smart enough to scare me.

140
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,579
Come on, get a hold of the box. Go ahead.

141
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,166
All right, come on, swing it around.

142
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,961
Well, help a little bit!

143
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,964
Oh, oh!

144
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,633
Come on, you fraidy-cat. These things can't harm ya.

145
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,010
They're made out of wax.

146
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,721
You know, people pay McDougal cash to come in here and get scared?

147
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,514
I'm cheatin' him. I'm gettin' scared for nothin'.

148
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,018
Go ahead and push, now. Don't knock anything over.

149
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,104
There we are. Now, we get the dolly out from underneath there.

150
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,065
Lift up that end. Lift it up!

151
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,485
Come on, come on.

152
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,487
There you are.

153
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,408
Well, put it down, put it down. Do I have to do all the work?

154
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,243
I'll get it down.
Well, put it down.

155
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,163
Go ahead. Now, open it up.

156
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,499
I'm going out and get the other crate. And no back talk!

157
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,501
I've got just two words to say to you.
What is that?

158
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,837
Hurry back.

159
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,100
Hello? Yes, Mr. McDougal.

160
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,854
Yeah, the crates are here. Wilbur's opening one right now.

161
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,066
Everything's all right.

162
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,902
Okay, Mr. McDougal. Goodbye.

163
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,079
Chick? Oh, Chick!

164
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,789
What's the matter? What's the matter?

165
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,707
Did you turn out the light?
Certainly not.

166
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,542
They're out.
So what?

167
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,961
Maybe the lightning struck the power line or something.

168
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,671
I get in more messes around here...

169
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,090
Never mind, take off that canvas.

170
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,634
Take it off?
Take it off!

171
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,349
Hey, a coffin!
Coffin.

172
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,603
The Dracula crest.
Dracula's crest.

173
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:14,149
I wonder if Mr. McDougal expects people to think that Dracula's really in there.

174
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,360
No, don't. Please don't.

175
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:21,573
Oh, now come, come, come. Dracula was just a legendary character.

176
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,283
He never existed.
No?

177
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,660
Certainly not.

178
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,204
Fold up this canvas. I'm going out and get the other crate.

179
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,124
If you want me, just holler. Holler, "Oh, Chick!" You understand?

180
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,417
Oh, Chick!
What do you want?

181
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,502
What kept you?
I haven't left yet.

182
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,045
The next time, don't take so long.

183
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,339
Come on. Fold this up. Get busy.

184
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:56,191
"Count Dracula sleeps in this coffin, but rises every night at sunset."

185
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,319
Chick is right. This is awful silly stuff.

186
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,737
"Dracula..."

187
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,751
Chick! Chick!

188
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,628
What's the matter now? You know that person you said that

189
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,880
there's no such person?
Yes?

190
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,465
I think he's in there, in person.

191
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,718
I was reading this sign over here, this one down here, "Dracula's Legend".

192
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,802
All of a sudden I heard...

193
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,098
That's the wind.
It should get oiled.

194
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,766
Listen, stop reading this thing.

195
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,644
That's a lot of phony baloney to fool McDougal's customers.

196
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,814
Now, fold up that canvas. Get busy. Come on.

197
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,620
"Dracula can change himself at will into a vampire bat,

198
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,040
"flying about the countryside."

199
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,585
Flying.

200
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,378
Wooo...

201
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,013
Chick!

202
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,516
Listen, you're making enough noise to wake up the dead!

203
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,768
I don't have to wake him up. He's up. I saw a hand.

204
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,229
You saw a hand?
Where?
Right over there.

205
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,481
Let me see it.
Right over here.

206
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,233
Where is it?
I saw a hand there!

207
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,484
You don't know what you're talking about!

208
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,737
You're all excited reading this legend. Now, listen. Listen, Wilbur.

209
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,697
I know there's no such a person as Dracula.

210
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,991
You know there's no such a person as Dracula.

211
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,577
But does Dracula know it?
Now, listen to me.

212
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,454
McDougal will be here any minute with the insurance agent.

213
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,164
Now get to work!

214
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:56,019
"He keeps himself alive by drinking the blood..."

215
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,661
Chick. Chick.

216
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,247
Chick.

217
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,500
Chick. Ch...

218
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,132
Chick!

219
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,095
Now, listen, this is getting to be ridiculous.

220
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,347
What? What?

221
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,100
Are you trying to tell me that candle moved?

222
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,270
Look, wait a minute. Candles can't move!
This one did.

223
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,856
Yeah, there. Watch it. Keep your eye on it.

224
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,233
Is it moving? Huh?

225
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,110
It's not moving, is it?
Not now.

226
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,905
Well, use your brains a little bit. Let's get this job finished.

227
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,301
"He keeps himself alive by drinking the blood of his victims."

228
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:15,182
"Count Dracula must return to his coffin before sunrise. He..."

229
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,230
Chick! Chick!

230
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,401
Oh, Chick! Chick!

231
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,405
Chick!

232
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,077
Oh, Chick, come on! Come on!

233
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,412
All right, I'm comin'.

234
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,832
Come on, will ya!
Now, wait a minute. What's wrong now?

235
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,460
Oh, Chick!

236
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,837
You gonna tell me that candle moved again?
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,172
I told you not to read this, didn't I?

238
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,508
I can't help it. I can't help it.
Oh, stop.

239
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,968
"Count Dracula must return to his coffin before sunrise,

240
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,596
"where he lies helpless during the day."

241
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,890
That's the bunk!
That's what I'm trying to tell ya.

242
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,101
That's his bunk!

243
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,520
Come here.

244
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,023
Oh, don't, Chick.
Come here. Come here! Come around here!

245
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,111
Come over here. Look in there.

246
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,114
Now, do you see anything?

247
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,241
No.
Certainly not.

248
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,035
Come on, help me open that crate. Come on.

249
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,873
Come on, get with it, will you please?

250
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,042
You can always...

251
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:28,588
"Frankenstein's Monster". Get a load of this here. Come here.

252
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,299
"A scientist named Frankenstein made a monster

253
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,760
"by sewing together parts of old, dead bodies."

254
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,429
Do you have to read that stuff?
Wait a minute.

255
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:40,308
"Frankenstein gave the monster eternal life by shooting it full of electricity.

256
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,062
"Some people claim it is not dead even now, just dormant."

257
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,275
Now, who'd be silly enough to believe that?

258
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,407
Who would be silly enough to believe that?
Yeah.

259
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,996
Me.

260
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,417
Come on, open up that crate.

261
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,349
Chick, did you hear that?

262
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,935
Yeah, I heard you pulling the nails out, certainly. Go ahead.

263
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,354
Pulling the nails?

264
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,908
Chick?
Oh, quiet.

265
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,827
I don't want to hear any more of your foolish questions.

266
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,371
Come on, open up the crate, will you?

267
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,586
There we are.

268
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,881
You've got it. Now get a hold of it.

269
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,342
Throw it right on the side.

270
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,929
That's it, fine. Now, come on, help me with this excelsior.

271
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,848
Come on, take it all out. Get it all out.

272
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,935
Wow! Look out! Chick, cover it up!

273
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,478
What's the matter?
Cover it up!
Wait a minute.

274
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,188
Cover the whole...
What's the matter with you?

275
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,941
Stop that!

276
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,236
Now you did it.

277
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,238
Hey, what are you doing in there with the lights off?

278
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,406
Hey, McDougal! Now we're in trouble.

279
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,826
Hide that head. Hurry up! Hurry up!

280
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,644
Master.

281
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,646
Yes.

282
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,223
Come. Follow me.

283
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,616
Don't be afraid. He won't hurt you.

284
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,410
Come!

285
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,956
Hurry up. Come.

286
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,209
This better be a good one.

287
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:20,088
What's the matter, you afraid of the dark?
No.

288
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,632
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

289
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,595
What is this?

290
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,598
Hey, Wilbur, McDougal is here. I... What's the matter with you?

291
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,850
Come on, snap out of it.

292
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,018
Where are they? Where are my bodies?

293
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,394
What bodies? There were no bodies.

294
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,354
We opened both crates. I showed it to Wilbur. Look in there.

295
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,856
If they're not here, where are they?
I don't know.

296
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,524
They must be stolen.
My company inspected

297
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,859
the contents before they were shipped.

298
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,318
Then they must've been stolen en route.

299
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,446
You mean, you saw them?
No, no, no.

300
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,031
Well, then where did they go?
I don't know.

301
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,450
If they're gone, I want my insurance money.
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,785
My company doesn't pay off until a full investigation.

303
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,370
Did you hear that? If you don't produce those bodies,

304
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,663
I'm going to call the police!

305
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,332
Police?
Police!

306
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,127
I can do better than that. Police!

307
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,670
I'll get you.
Police!

308
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,089
Come on.
Wait a minute...

309
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,307
Let's take it out.

310
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,688
Come!

311
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,216
Good evening, Dr. Mornay.

312
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,177
My dear Count, it's so good to see you again.

313
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,430
And you look more charming than when I saw you last.

314
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:38,726
Come in, Count Dracula.
Thank you, Sandra.

315
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,478
But the name is Dr. Lejos.

316
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,064
I wouldn't want to frighten your technical assistant.

317
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,315
Professor Stevens?

318
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,194
Don't worry. He's completely engrossed in his work.

319
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,238
Besides, he should be out of here by tomorrow.

320
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,447
Excellent.

321
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,159
Yes, except that he's asking too many questions.

322
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,412
I will take care of that. Is everything else arranged?

323
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,081
Yes. Where did you leave him?
In the cold.

324
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,791
I'll get a wrap.

325
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,307
Nervous, my dear?

326
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,726
This is risky business.

327
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,854
Not as risky as those curious operations of yours,

328
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:29,068
that so intrigued the European police. Yet much more profitable.

329
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:33,781
Restore the monster for me, and you shall have anything you wish.

330
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,868
In that case, we better start as soon as possible.

331
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,455
It's dangerous to leave him in this weakened condition.

332
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,917
Have you mastered Dr. Frankenstein's notebook?

333
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,962
Let me get my hand on a scalpel again and you shall see.

334
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,048
And about the brain?

335
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,927
I don't want to repeat Frankenstein's mistake, and revive a vicious,

336
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,637
unmanageable brute.

337
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,432
This time the monster must have no will of his own.

338
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,936
No fiendish intellect to oppose his master.

339
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,814
There, my dear Count, I believe I have exceeded your fondest wishes.

340
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,443
The new brain I've chosen for the monster is so simple,

341
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,988
so pliable, he will obey you like a trained dog.

342
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:18,034
Good. How soon?

343
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,121
The day after tomorrow. Wilbur was taking me to a masquerade ball.

344
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:26,000
But I'm sure he'd prefer to spend a quiet evening at home.

345
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,545
Bring him through here.

346
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,267
I tell you, Chick, I saw what I saw when I saw it!

347
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,770
Keep quiet! You babbling about dead people walking away!

348
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,523
That's why we were arrested and thrown in jail.

349
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,110
Do you realize that we've spent a whole day and night in jail?

350
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,697
And we'd still be there if some dame hadn't've bailed us out.

351
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,450
Chick, now stop calling Sandra a dame!

352
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,537
And I'm tellin' ya, they were there.

353
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,456
Oh, stop.
Two of 'em.

354
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,917
One of 'em was about eight foot tall.

355
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,379
Way up there! And he walked like this.

356
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,553
Just like that.

357
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,515
Now, that's the way he walked.
Stop it.

358
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,058
You don't believe that?
Certainly not!

359
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,144
Well, I saw it.

360
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,772
And the other one, he went like this.

361
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,487
And he kept gettin' closer and closer.

362
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,574
He had eyes that were balls of fire.

363
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,911
He kept staring, eye to eye.

364
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,457
Eye to eye! Staring!

365
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,293
I never saw anything like it in my life.

366
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,296
Believe me, Chick, when I tell you I was scared to death.

367
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,258
Really I was. I was really scared, Chick.

368
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,345
What's the matter? Chick?

369
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,183
What did I do?

370
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:09,854
Hey, Chick, I don't like you like that. Come on, be just like you used to be.

371
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,024
Go away with it!
Attaboy! I'm happy.

372
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,233
That's just like you used to be.

373
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,235
All right. Now, stop this nonsense! All of it.

374
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,080
You're Wilbur Grey?
Yes, sir.

375
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,831
Then you must be Chick Young.
So what?

376
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,334
I'm Lawrence Talbot. I've been looking all over town for you.

377
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,879
You didn't have to look far. We were in jail.
Yes, I know.

378
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,799
You see, I'm the one who telephoned you not to deliver those bodies.

379
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,885
I knew they were alive!

380
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,762
There you are, so you thought I was imagining things, huh?

381
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,514
When I told you about the fellow that was eight-foot tall,

382
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,725
and walking like this with the stiff legs, and then the other fellow with this here.

383
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,937
Wait! Wait a minute. You're crazy, and so is this screwball!

384
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,732
Look, bub, I have my own troubles.
Worse than you think.

385
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,776
I followed Dracula all the way from Europe,

386
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,114
because I believe that he's going to try and revive the Frankenstein monster.

387
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,574
We must find him and destroy him before he can do this!

388
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,827
Wait a minute, why don't you go down to the police,

389
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,995
tell them you know the story about Dracula and the Monster.

390
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,457
They'd be very interested.
I can't do that.

391
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,128
Because then I'd have to tell them who I am and...

392
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,172
Why I know what I know.

393
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,260
Soon... Soon the moon will rise.

394
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,060
I haven't time to explain.

395
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:34,772
I've taken the room across the hall. Here's the key. Lock me in!

396
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,275
Lock you in?
Yes, please. Hurry!

397
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,027
It's silly, but I'll do it.

398
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,988
He's scared too.

399
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,785
Remember, no matter what you hear or what happens,

400
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,704
don't let me out!

401
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,309
"Lock me in." That guy is screwier than you are.

402
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,436
He is not. He's a nice man.

403
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,647
He's just worried about the police getting him because he knows they're alive.

404
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,567
I'm going to bed.
Well...

405
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,737
Hey, he forgot his bag.

406
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,285
Mr. Talbot, you forgot your grip.

407
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:39,128
Mr. Talbot?

408
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,609
Now, how'd he get out of here?

409
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,693
Hmm.

410
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,237
I'll leave him a note.

411
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:15,289
"I left your bag in the bedroom.

412
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,418
"Wilbur."

413
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,742
I wonder if he counted these.

414
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,703
He might've.

415
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,308
Maybe he didn't.

416
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,228
Hmm.

417
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,108
A fine insurance company I'm doing business with,

418
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,027
outsmarted by a couple of morons!

419
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,613
Those two crooks got out of jail. On bail!

420
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,906
We know that, Mr. McDougal, but you see we...

421
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,327
In fact, I arranged it.
You? Who are you?

422
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,455
This is Miss Raymond, an investigator from the home office.

423
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,500
It's my job, Mr. McDougal, to find those missing exhibits.

424
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,922
I'm quite sure I can persuade the chubby little fellow to lead me right to them.

425
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,551
Naturally, I couldn't persuade him very well in jail.

426
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,097
Wilbur, please! I've had nightmares all night long!

427
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,891
I don't want to hear any more about dead bodies.

428
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,643
I saw what I saw when I saw it.

429
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,561
All right.

430
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,231
Boy, am I glad to see you. Will you go over and talk to that guy?

431
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:07,610
Sandra!
Wilbur darling, I heard what happened.

432
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,488
That's awful. They can't put my little Wilbur in jail.

433
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,989
They can't, but they did.

434
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,575
Sandra, I wanna thank you for bailing us out.

435
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,702
I? I only learned about it this morning.

436
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,455
Well, didn't the policeman tell you that a lady bailed us out?

437
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,290
He did.

438
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,752
Wilbur, pet, you haven't been untrue to your Sandra?

439
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,464
Sandra, how can you look me in the face and say that?

440
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,926
How can you look him in the face, period?

441
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,971
I only came by to remind you about the masquerade ball tonight.

442
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,182
I was just getting ready to pick up my costume.

443
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,061
Come by for me early, dearest. About sunset.

444
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,440
Alone. Goodbye.

445
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,945
What I'd like to know is, what has he got that I haven't got?

446
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,530
A brain.

447
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,911
A brain.
I'd like to know where it is.

448
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,664
Oh. She forgot to kiss me goodbye.

449
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:12,633
Now, who is this?
She's... She's... She's beautiful.

450
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,553
I'm Joan Raymond.
She's Joan Raymond.

451
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,222
I'm the girl who arranged your release from jail.

452
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,808
Well, why should you want to spring us?

453
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,561
Do you believe in love at first sight?

454
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,106
Well! As long as you put it that way, I...

455
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,734
That's what happened to me.

456
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,319
Wilbur, darling!

457
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:40,119
Miss Raymond, when did this mad feeling first come over you?

458
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,455
The instant I saw you in the baggage room.

459
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,709
I knew then that I wanted to spend every single minute that I'm in town with you.

460
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,294
You did?

461
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,754
What are we doing tonight?

462
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,630
He's going to a masquerade ball.

463
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,133
But I'm not doing anything.

464
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,052
In that case, you'll be awfully lonesome.
Well, naturally...

465
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:01,390
Wilbur darling, I haven't been to a masquerade ball in ages.

466
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:03,267
I was just hoping you'd ask me.

467
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,227
Wilbur! Come here.

468
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,192
Miss Raymond, will you excuse me?

469
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,278
Oh, you irresistible boy!

470
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:19,575
Do you want me?
Yes, I want you. Come over here.

471
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,162
I just wanted to get a good look at you in the light.

472
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,331
I still don't get it.
Jealous?

473
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,626
Wilbur, I'll have to go out and get a costume.

474
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,795
That's funny. I was just going, too.

475
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,632
I'll go down to my room and pick up a couple things and meet you in the lobby.

476
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,009
All right. In the lobby.

477
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,386
I'll get my hat and coat. I'll be right with you.

478
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,805
Excuse me.
Look.

479
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,974
Now you've got two dates. What about Sandra, you bigamist?

480
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,603
Sandra? I don't know. Joan is awful cute.

481
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,731
All right, you take Joan, I'll take Sandra.
Oh, Sandra sends me.

482
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,442
Well, then I'll take Joan.
Joan sends me too.

483
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,402
Now, listen, you sawed-off Romeo,

484
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,529
in a minute, I'll send you!

485
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,240
You don't even appeal to me.

486
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,451
Look, Wilbur, we've always been pals, haven't we?

487
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:03,869
Oh, yes.
We've always shared,

488
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,955
and shared alike, haven't we?
Mm-hmm.

489
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,541
Well, now, look, let's be reasonable. Come on.

490
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,626
I've always shared with you.
That you have!

491
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,337
If I had two cigarettes, I'd give you one.
That's right.

492
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,422
And if I had two pair of shoes, I'd give you a pair.

493
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,132
Don't I know that?
And if I have two girls...

494
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,009
Well?

495
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,304
Why don't you light that cigarette, put on those shoes and take a walk for yourself?

496
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,181
That's what I'm going to do, but with you.

497
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,448
This key don't fit. This is... Talbot's key.

498
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,367
Hey, we forgot about him.

499
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,960
Boy, what a bender he must've been on last night!

500
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,547
Hey, Mr. Talbot. Mr. Talbot!

501
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,757
And I thought you were such a nice man, too. Look at yourself.

502
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,261
You're a mess!
Last night...

503
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,056
I went through another of my horrible experiences.

504
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,852
Years ago I was bitten by a werewolf.

505
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,897
Ever since, when the full moon rises,

506
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,065
I turn into a wolf myself.

507
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,652
Oh, pal, that's all right.

508
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:24,617
I'm sort of a wolf myself.
And here I thought...

509
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,453
I thought that you were the only one that would believe me,

510
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:31,498
that you were the one that knew that I spoke the truth.

511
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,169
You have seen the living dead.
Mm-hmm.

512
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,590
I came all the way from Europe,

513
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,968
because Dracula and the Monster must be destroyed.

514
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,929
Together we must find them!

515
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,348
Oh no, now, wait a minute. Let's not start that all over again.

516
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,100
I can't go. I've got a date. In fact, I've got two dates.

517
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:54,521
But you and I have a date with destiny.

518
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,941
Let Chick go with Destiny.

519
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,401
Won't you please?

520
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,038
You two kids stay here. I'm going up and get Sandra.

521
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,709
She's mine too.

522
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,589
Pardon me just a minute. Wilbur!

523
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,092
Now, look, you've got Joan and Sandra.

524
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,719
You've got two girls!
How about the two girls we had last week?

525
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,804
Let's not talk about that.

526
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,222
You got no kick comin'.
I'm not kicking.

527
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,848
You had the best lookin' one.
So what?

528
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,559
Yours had teeth.
Look, Wilbur, yours had teeth too.

529
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,269
Did you see that tooth?
Yes, I happened to see it.

530
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,939
Mine had so much bridgework, every time I kissed her I had to pay toll.

531
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,232
What's the use?

532
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,694
Wilbur, can't we both go along, too?

533
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,947
Yes, mon amour. That's Spanish.
That's French.

534
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:49,326
How do you like that? I speak French too.
Oh, you cute little devil!

535
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,161
Stop that.

536
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,164
Come on, lead the way.
Come on.

537
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,727
Hello.
Hello.

538
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,437
Is Sandra in?
Who?

539
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,732
Sandra.
You mean, Dr. Mornay?

540
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,276
Well, if that's what she is, I'm just what the doctor ordered.

541
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,279
Come in.
Thank you.

542
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,240
I thought this Sandra was your date.

543
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,909
Or did we both come along for the ride?
No, no.

544
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,912
Perhaps I should introduce myself. I'm Professor Stevens.

545
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,416
This is Miss Raymond, This is Wilbur Grey, and I'm Chick Young.

546
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,918
How do you do, Miss Raymond?
How do you do?

547
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,796
I have work to finish, but it shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

548
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,381
If you'll wait in the library, I'll be right down.

549
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,259
Just to keep the records clear. We're here to pick up Sandra.

550
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,471
Of course. I'm sure she's around somewhere.

551
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,932
Wilbur!

552
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,601
Sandra, hello.

553
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,479
That girl, who is she?

554
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,149
She's Chick's date. She's going to the masquerade with us.

555
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,527
But I told you to come here alone. We'll have to get rid of them.

556
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,238
I'll have to get rid of somebody.

557
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,450
Hello, Sandra.
Hello, Chick.

558
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,161
Joan, this is Sandra. Sandra, Joan.

559
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,623
Nice place you have here, Doctor.
Who told you I was a doctor?

560
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,375
Why, the young man who answered the door.

561
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,795
Oh, Professor Stevens.

562
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,006
I'm on a vacation, you see, and traveling incognito.

563
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,051
What are you doing here?
Same thing.

564
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,098
Shall we get going?
Just as soon as I put on my costume.

565
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,184
Would you like to powder your nose?
I'd love to.

566
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,562
I'll be right back, Wilbur.

567
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,190
I'll be right back, too, Wilbur.

568
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,777
Toodle-oo!

569
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:56,245
Chick, there's a time in everyone's life when they get in trouble.

570
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,372
I'm in a mess of it right now.
Now, what's wrong?

571
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,250
I've got two girls.
You know the old saying?

572
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,960
"Everything comes in threes."

573
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,212
Now, suppose a third girl should fall in love with you?

574
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,549
What's her name?
We'll say her name is Mary.

575
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,300
Is she pretty?
Beautiful.

576
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,052
Naturally, she'd have to be.

577
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,930
Now you have Mary, you have Joan, and you have Sandra.

578
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,724
So, to prove to you that I'm your pal, your bosom friend,

579
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,726
I'll take one of the girls off your hands.

580
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,564
Chick, you're what I call a real pal.
It's all right.

581
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,066
You take Mary.

582
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:30,112
We better answer that phone. They're all upstairs.

583
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,739
Hello.
Hello?

584
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,283
Is Dr. Lejos there?

585
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,368
Just a minute. Somebody wants to know about a Dr. Lejos.

586
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,411
I don't know him.

587
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,955
Hello? Who is this speaking?
This is Wilbur Grey.

588
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,041
I thought I recognized your voice.

589
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,460
This is Talbot speaking.

590
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,590
Listen. I just got a line on Dracula and the Monster.

591
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,678
A certain Dr. Lejos has been receiving a lot of electrical equipment,

592
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,764
just the type necessary to revive the Monster.

593
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,601
So what? I'm way out on an island.

594
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,061
I've got my own problems.
Yes, but listen.

595
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:07,357
I believe you're in the house of Dracula right now.

596
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,735
You can find the Monster, and I'll...

597
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,696
Hello?

598
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,156
Wilbur!

599
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,782
Come here!

600
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,910
Chick, you don't know what you're doin'...

601
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,162
What's the matter with you?
Quiet. Come here.

602
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,414
You didn't hang up the phone.
Let him hang up the phone.

603
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,498
Who?
Dracula.

604
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,875
Dracula and the Monster live here.

605
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,920
Wait a minute. Don't start that again. Who told you that?

606
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,214
Talbot. He also said that we got to search the place.

607
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,340
Come here.

608
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,383
Come over here.

609
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,595
Now, listen, Talbot, enough is enough. Now, Wilbur's scared to...

610
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,181
Hello? Hello? He's gone.
So am I.

611
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,558
No, you don't. Come here. I'm gonna settle this thing once and for all.

612
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,436
We'll search this place.
Look, Chick, it's a little past sunset,

613
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,730
and if Dracula is here, he's gonna be wanting breakfast.

614
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,066
And I'm fatter than you, and it ain't gonna be me!

615
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,485
Now, just a minute. Just a minute.
It ain't gonna be me!

616
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,030
Wait a minute, I'm gonna prove just how crazy both you and Talbot really are.

617
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,074
We'll search this place, right from the basement.

618
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,158
Look, Chick.
What?

619
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,243
We'll search it.
That's more...

620
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,577
You and I together.
Now we're talkin'.

621
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,579
Attaboy. You search the basement,
I'll search outside.

622
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:03,956
Oh, no, you don't!
All right, then,

623
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,582
I'll search on outside, and you search the basement.

624
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,708
That's different.

625
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,044
It worked!
Come on!

626
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,547
Now, let's look around here.

627
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,676
There's some doors down there.

628
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,928
You think we oughta tell Sandra where we're goin'?

629
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,263
Certainly not.

630
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,475
You look over there.

631
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:37,614
Well?
Broom closet.

632
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,283
What?

633
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,619
Broom closet? Look out.

634
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,705
Come on.

635
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,333
Broom closet?

636
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,379
Come on!
Wait for me.

637
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,922
Come on.

638
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,516
Oh!

639
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,813
Chick! Open!

640
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,119
Whoa!

641
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,376
Chick! Come on. Chick!

642
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,006
Chick! Y-you searched down there, a-and inside, ohh...
Shh.

643
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,890
Stop!
It's the truth. Come here.

644
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,728
All I did was like this.

645
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,482
Now, Chick, I tell you, right over there.

646
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,774
Where are they? Where are they?

647
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,485
They're in there. They're in there.
Now, listen.

648
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,030
Wait a minute. I'm gonna look around.
You go ahead.

649
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,908
If I don't find anybody, I'm gonna beat your ears off.

650
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,451
I'm telling you, Chick. Honest.
Well, wait here.

651
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,038
They're over there. Oh, no. I ain't goin' near that place anymore.

652
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,963
Whoa! Ooh!

653
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,718
Open sesame! Open sesame!

654
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,240
Well, where are they?
They must be in there.

655
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:52,536
Oh, stop. Now, listen Wilbur, I'm getting sick and tired of this silly nonsense of yours.

656
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,997
Some guy going around...
No, no.

657
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,000
Another guy goin'...
No, no!

658
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,002
The one guy goes... The big...

659
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:04,214
And the other guy, not like that, like this.

660
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,551
Yeah. All right, all right, all right. Put your hands down.

661
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,971
Come on, the girls are waiting for us upstairs. Come on.

662
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,308
Have you known Wilbur long?
Yes, we're old friends.

663
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,812
Will you be long?
Just a few minutes.

664
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,785
Miss Raymond?
Yes?

665
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,872
I'm ready. Shall we go?

666
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,624
Of course.

667
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,293
Here's your purse, dear.
Thank you.

668
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,185
Who screamed?
You did!

669
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,270
I did?

670
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,359
Now, listen, Wilbur, if you don't stop imagining these crazy things,

671
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,486
I'll take you to a doctor to have you examined.

672
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,530
But I'm telling you, I saw them. And when I see what I see, I saw it. That's all.

673
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,199
Because Mr. Talbot, same way, he saw it too.

674
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:57,243
Talbot! He's crazy. You're both crazy!

675
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,162
Sandra.

676
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,290
Sandra, I've just gotta tell you. I was downstairs in the basement.

677
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,335
Basement? And what were you doing down there?

678
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,795
I opened the door.
He opened the door,

679
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,046
and fell down the stairs.

680
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,298
Fibber.
How careless!

681
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:15,178
You should be careful! A person can get killed that way!

682
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,180
I hope you weren't disturbed, Dr. Lejos.

683
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,724
It's perfectly all right, my dear. Introduce me.

684
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:22,644
This is Miss Raymond. Mr. Young.

685
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,312
And this is Wilbur.

686
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:29,150
Ah, Wilbur! Why!

687
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,279
I heard so much about you, I feel as if we have already met.

688
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:39,536
And I must say, my dear, I approve very highly of your choice.

689
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,373
What we need today is young blood.

690
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,375
And brains!

691
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:52,549
Oh, don't be bashful. Come.

692
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:57,053
Hello, Dr. Lejos. I've been looking for you all day.

693
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:00,265
You know, every time I ask Dr. Mornay what that equipment is going to be used for,

694
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:01,683
she says to ask you.

695
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,518
Of course.

696
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,146
Didn't I hear that you were going to masquerade ball?

697
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,816
Yes, we have our costumes out in the boat.
Oh, you young people!

698
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,612
Making the most of life, while it lasts.

699
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:16,906
Thank you.

700
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:20,368
Professor, you've worked hard and well.

701
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:24,372
Why don't you join them, and save your questions until tomorrow?

702
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:29,043
Under ordinary circumstances I'd say no, but... If you don't mind?

703
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,796
Not at all.
Good. I'll get my coat.

704
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,260
Of course that would make too many for one boat.

705
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,638
But if the professor and this lady and gentleman go on ahead...
Sure.

706
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,683
Wilbur and Dr. Mornay can...
I'm afraid I can't.

707
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,101
What's the matter?

708
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,312
I've suddenly developed a splitting headache.

709
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,315
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you'll have to go without me.

710
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,901
Nonsense! It will pass as quickly as it came.

711
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:56,654
It's no use, Doctor. I shall have to go directly to bed.

712
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:02,660
Pardon me.
Well, Chick, there goes your date.

713
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,165
Now then, what was that all about?

714
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,127
This thing is too dangerous. The girl is an insurance investigator.

715
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,379
Stevens is asking too many questions.

716
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,007
And Wilbur was up to something in the basement.

717
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,383
I think we ought to wait.

718
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,429
And jeopardize the success of the operation? Never!

719
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:23,306
I must warn you, my dear Sandra,

720
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,726
I am accustomed to having my orders obeyed,

721
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,605
especially by women with a price on their heads.

722
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,608
Don't try to scare me, Count Dracula.

723
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:45,286
Here. The Secrets of Life and Death by Dr. Frankenstein.

724
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:52,293
Memorize them. Operate yourself, if you're in such a hurry.

725
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:56,506
I have other ways of securing your cooperation.

726
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,717
You're wasting your time. My will is as strong as yours.

727
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,928
Are you sure?

728
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,100
Look into my eyes.

729
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,562
Look!

730
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,703
Deeper.

731
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,455
Tell me what you see.

732
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,058
Joan, Chick and I are gonna go into the lockers and change into our costumes.

733
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,352
Come on, Professor.
We'll meet you on the dance floor.

734
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,146
Okay.

735
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,734
What did I do?
What do you mean?

736
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,736
He's dancing with my girl!
So what?

737
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,071
I'll show her!

738
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,323
♪ I'm in love...

739
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,742
Come on. Pick up those bundles!
Okay.

740
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,035
Let's get dressed. Come on.

741
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,998
So, it's you!
Ah, he knows me!

742
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,626
McDougal!
Listen, fat boy, where are my exhibits?

743
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,710
Now, you leave him alone!

744
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,670
Not until he tells me where those exhibits are.

745
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,590
Where are they? Where are they?

746
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,759
McDougal, now we've got it on you.

747
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,595
You put us in jail. Now, we'll have you arrested for assault and battery.

748
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,722
Go ahead and see what good it'll do ya. You haven't got a witness.

749
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,224
I'm a witness!
My word's as good as yours!

750
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,560
Your word is better than his.
You keep outta this.

751
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:35,855
I'll get a witness. Do me a favor, will you, fella?

752
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,690
Will you watch this? I need a witness.

753
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,902
Go ahead. I'd like to see you do it again.

754
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,446
Did you see it?

755
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,199
I'm sorry. I couldn't see a thing.

756
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,204
Thank you.

757
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,539
Have you seen Chick Young or Wilbur Grey?

758
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,001
Seen them? I don't even know them.

759
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,713
I've got to know what they found on that island.

760
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,132
Chick! Wilbur! What did you find?

761
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,759
Was I right?
No.

762
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,637
And I wish you'd stop trying to put those ideas in this boy's head.

763
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,306
He's not used to them. Go put your things on, Wilbur.

764
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,392
Did you meet Dr. Lejos?
Yes.

765
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:16,646
What did he look like? Tall, aristocratic, a faraway look in his eye?

766
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,982
All I know is he told us to go out and have some fun.

767
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,274
Why don't you?

768
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,778
Can't I convince you that Dracula is a very dangerous person?

769
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:28,741
You and Wilbur are just trying to scare me. Well, it won't work!

770
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,246
I scared ya.

771
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,706
I scared ya, you big sissy.

772
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,165
This is your mask over there.
Mine?

773
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,712
Oh, no, no. Please don't wear that.
What's the matter?

774
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:44,007
I know you'll think I'm crazy, but...

775
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:47,635
In a half an hour the moon will rise, and I'll turn into a wolf.

776
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,430
You and 20 million other guys.
Listen!

777
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,849
I might tear you limb from limb!

778
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,059
Is that serious?
He'll murder ya!

779
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,769
That's serious.

780
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,065
It won't be if you'll just take me and lock me in my room.

781
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,860
Please.
Oh, all right.

782
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,404
Why don't you hire yourself a keeper?

783
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,614
Come on.

784
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,123
Hey!

785
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,460
Look.
Oh, Sandra's coming.

786
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:26,382
Is it all clear? I will take care of the girl.

787
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:29,135
And you'll take Wilbur back to the castle.

788
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,013
Understand?
Yes, Master.

789
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,311
Sandra, you look...

790
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,564
So... We meet again, Count Dracula.

791
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,358
Dracula?
Yes. That's who he says you are.

792
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:49,197
Oh, my costume perhaps.
No, Talbot here thinks you're the real thing.

793
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,407
Uh-huh. Right out of McDougal's House of Horrors.

794
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,077
What an odd hallucination.

795
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:58,331
But the human mind is often inflamed with strange complexes.

796
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,794
I suggest you consult your physician, Mr. Talbot.

797
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,670
And take him along with you, please.

798
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,757
Well, so there you are!

799
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,218
I'm glad to see you've recovered.

800
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,679
I didn't expect to see you here, Doctor.
Sandra insisted I come.

801
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,432
Besides, I need a little relaxation.

802
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,018
Miss Raymond, would you honor me with a dance?

803
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,437
No. No!

804
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,815
I warn you. He is Count Dracula!

805
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,775
How interesting. Tell me more.

806
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,945
No, let me tell you... While we dance.

807
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,696
Pardon me, Mr. Talbot.

808
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:35,701
Sandra, do you feel all right?
Of course.

809
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,121
But I must obey my doctor's orders.

810
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:41,999
Oh, sure! You gotta do what the doctor tells ya.

811
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:46,379
I intend to. Let's have a walk, Wilbur.

812
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,172
Toodle-oo.

813
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,551
Professor, do you understand women?

814
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,720
I don't even try. I'm gonna get me a drink.

815
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,572
Sit here.

816
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,329
Sandra, there's something strange about ya. You're not yourself.

817
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,582
Is there anything I can do to help?
Yes.

818
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,002
I want you to go away with me to the island.

819
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,671
Just me and you?
Yes.

820
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:33,426
I want to be the only one in your life. I want to be part of you.

821
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,596
I want to be in your blood.

822
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,104
I think I know what you mean.

823
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:49,483
Wouldn't you want a prettier fellow than me?
No. I want no one but you.

824
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:53,571
You are so full-blooded, so round, so firm.

825
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,783
So fully packed. And I want to stay that way.

826
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,038
Stuck myself. I'm bleedin'.

827
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,790
Let me see it.
Uh-uh.

828
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:09,003
There ain't enough there for the two of us, if that's what you're thinking.

829
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,923
I'll tell you what I'm thinking. Look into my eyes.

830
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,968
I'm afraid to.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

831
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,013
Look. Deeper.

832
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,265
Deeper!

833
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,143
Deeper.

834
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,078
I looked deep enough. I don't wanna look anymore.

835
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,330
Of course you do.

836
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,707
Don't you know what's going to happen now?

837
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,836
I'll bite.
Oh, no... I will!

838
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:54,548
Wilbur!
Joan!
Wilbur!

839
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,342
Joan!
There he is.

840
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,970
Wilbur, have you seen Joan?

841
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,097
No, but I have definitely made up my mind.

842
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,432
You can have Sandra, but make sure you've got plenty of bandages.

843
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,102
Maybe Dracula lured Joan into the woods and...

844
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,105
Chick, do you know what could happen if I meet Dracula in the woods?

845
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,941
I'll bite.
Oh, no. You gotta stand in line.

846
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,318
Let's not waste any time.
Yeah, let's.

847
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,614
Joan? Joan?

848
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,286
Joan! Chick, we can't find her.

849
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,914
Now, let's keep on looking. Come on.
Joan!

850
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,379
Joan?

851
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,300
Chick, we're never gonna find her.

852
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,552
Joan!

853
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,895
Joan?

854
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,945
Joan?

855
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,872
Joan?

856
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:18,758
Joan!

857
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,515
Chick? Chick?

858
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,518
Where did he go? Chick!

859
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:32,605
I'm gettin' tired of lookin' for Joan.

860
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,942
Look at him.

861
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,237
Didn't Mr. Talbot tell you not to put that mask on anymore?

862
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,448
Now, what'd you put it on for?

863
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:46,285
Now, take the mask off! Come on!

864
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,215
Joan?

865
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,429
Hey, Chick, now, what are you lookin' in there for?

866
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:06,972
You know you're not gonna find Joan there.

867
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:11,394
Now, come on, get up! Get up! We gotta find Joan.

868
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,398
Come on, Chick. Now, take that mask off!

869
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,859
Take it easy. I'm your friend!

870
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,667
Help! Help!

871
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,836
Help!

872
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,633
The man's been hurt. Looks like something attacked him.

873
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,593
Get a doctor.

874
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,849
You'll be all right, though another half inch would have severed

875
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,225
your jugular vein.

876
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,644
Get him up.

877
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:57,106
Who did it?
It was somebody in a wolf's mask.

878
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,692
McDougal, what happened to you?

879
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,239
You! It was you! He said he was gonna get me.

880
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,615
Me?
That's right.

881
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,409
I saw him arguing with you earlier this evening.

882
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,537
That's ridiculous. Why, I wouldn't...

883
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,999
People, real live people.
That's a boy. Tell 'em.

884
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,125
You, Chick.
What's the matter?

885
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,960
What's the idea of trying to take a bite out of me?

886
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,211
What was the idea?
Now, you.

887
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,463
What, did he take a bite out of you too?

888
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,547
What's the matter with you, Chick?

889
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,882
You gone mad or something?
Wilbur!

890
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:23,966
Don't let that little fellow fool you.

891
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,593
He's an accomplice.
Me?

892
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,094
Let's call the sheriff.
I'll go call him.

893
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,220
Wait a minute...

894
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,389
Chick! Chick! Oh, Chick!

895
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:15,601
Chick! Count Dracula wants me...

896
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,105
Joan, Joan, come on. We gotta get outta here.

897
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,857
Joan?

898
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,361
Joan? Don't tell me you've gone bats too.

899
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,864
Wilbur! Wilbur! Wilbur!

900
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,596
Chick! Chick!

901
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,099
Chick, Chick.
Quiet. They're after me.

902
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,809
After you? What for?

903
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,312
McDougal was almost killed last night by either a wolf...

904
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,700
or a man wearing a mask of a wolf!

905
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,700
It was a wolf.

906
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,900
I'm going to give myself up. It's the only way to clear you.

907
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,600
Then... you were on the level about that wolf business?

908
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,000
Yes. I'm going to surrender.
You can't do that!

909
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,200
Dracula's taken Wilbur and Joan to the island.
Are you sure?

910
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,300
I saw what I saw when I saw it!

911
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,250
Hurry! Follow me!

912
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,750
They may come back.
But Dracula?

913
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,500
Dracula is helpless until after nightfall. Maybe by then we'll...

914
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:40,125
Okay. But after what I saw there'd better not be any maybe.

915
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,570
Sandra. Sandra?

916
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,000
Sandra!

917
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,500
Junior?

918
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,700
Junior?

919
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Junior,

920
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,200
will you help me get outta here?

921
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:13,050
Sandra! Junior. Sandra! Junior.

922
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,500
Shall we begin?
I've been waiting, master.

923
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:43,350
Sandra? Sandra?

924
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,300
He's growing weaker! Will he respond to the operation?

925
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,200
If the generators are kept going.
We must start immediately.

926
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,300
I'll get rid of Stevens, and you'll take care of him.

927
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
Sandra, what are you gonna do?

928
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,500
Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you.
Thank you.

929
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,300
Soon, instead of being short and chubby,

930
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:22,100
you'll be big and tall and as strong as an ox.

931
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,700
And furthermore, you'll live forever and never grow old.

932
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,000
Oh, Sandra,

933
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,600
you still love me.

934
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,800
But, Sandra, how are you gonna do all these things?
By a simple operation.

935
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,200
I shall remove your brain and put it in his body.

936
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,700
You're gonna take my brain and put it in Junior's body?
Yes.

937
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,200
Ha-ha! For a minute, I didn't know how you were gonna do it!

938
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,530
Oogh! Upppeeng!

939
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,000
Good evening, Professor.

940
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:09,650
Is everything under control?
Everything but my temper.

941
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,350
I found Miss Raymond in Dr. Mornay's room.

942
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:15,800
You should mind your own business, Professor.

943
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,300
I also found this, which is very much my business.

944
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,600
And after I've taken Joan back to town, I'm...

945
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,100
Hmm. Excellent.

946
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,400
Let's take him to the cellar. We can dispose of all the bodies at the same time.

947
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:45,350
Well, there's the boat. Let's look around.

948
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,750
Hey.
That must be the entrance to the castle.

949
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:53,850
Come on.

950
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,800
Come.

951
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,150
Lie down... here.

952
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,000
Yes... master.

953
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,900
Frankie, don't let 'em do it to ya.

954
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,800
Frankie boy. Listen to me, Frankie.

955
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,500
Don't let 'em do it to ya!

956
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,200
Frankie. Frankie! I'm tellin' ya, it's a bad deal.

957
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,900
I've had this brain for 30 years and it hasn't worked right yet.

958
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:08,300
Ask me how much one and one is, Frankie. Go ahead, ask me.

959
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,400
I don't know.

960
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,600
We'll be right back, Wilbur.

961
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,100
Okay, I'll wait.

962
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,000
Chick!
Wilbur!
Dracula is Dracula!

963
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,000
And Sandra's gonna use my brain to make a bigger dummy out of the other dummy.

964
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,100
I'll get you out of this.
No kiddin'! Hurry up.

965
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,700
Attaboy.

966
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,100
Does it hurt?
No, no. Go ahead, a little harder.

967
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,900
There's something wrong here…

968
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,300
What's the matter? All right, I'm doing the best I can!

969
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,100
Wait a minute. Oh, pardon me, I'm sorry.

970
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,900
There you are. Now, get outta here. Go ahead.

971
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,900
Hey, not that way. To the left!

972
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,200
Get him out. Get him out!

973
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,400
No door.
No door? Come on, get outta here!

974
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,800
Take it easy, you'll be all right.

975
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,800
We gotta get back to the castle. Joan's in there. Come on.

976
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,600
Come on, Wilbur.
Not me. I'm not goin' back in there.

977
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,700
I've got too much of what they want: brains.

978
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,900
All right. Get the motor started in the boat. Hurry up.
Okay.

979
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,800
They've escaped!

980
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,400
You attend to the monster. I can handle our fat friend. Come.

981
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,350
Wilbur.

982
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,700
Come back.

983
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,500
Come.

984
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,450
I said... come back!

985
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,800
Come!

986
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,800
Wilbur! We're all set. You got the boat...

987
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,200
Wilbur! He's not here!

988
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,700
Now where'd he go?

989
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,700
Look!

990
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:25,650
They started the operation.

991
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,900
They must've found him.
We've gotta go back.

992
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,450
You stay here with Joan.

993
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,600
Please... give me a little ether.

994
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,250
We don't need it. You won't feel a thing.

995
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,450
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you!

996
01:15:33,895 --> 01:15:35,895
Get me off here.

997
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,000
What are you lookin' out the window for? Somebody else comin' after me?

998
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,400
Hmm?

999
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,350
Chick, help! Please!

1000
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,200
Chick!

1001
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,700
Chick! Chick! Oh, Chick!

1002
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Aah, Chick!

1003
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,900
Chick! Aah!

1004
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,500
Back.

1005
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,700
Back!

1006
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Chick! Come on!

1007
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,400
Chick, do you believe me now?
Yes.

1008
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,250
Hurry up.

1009
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,550
Let's barricade the door. Get it over there.

1010
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,150
Okay.
Come on.

1011
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,500
There.

1012
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,250
Put your shoulder to the door. Hold it tight.

1013
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,800
We barricaded it. He can't get in here!

1014
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,000
Come on, Wilbur!

1015
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,300
Come on!

1016
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,950
Help!

1017
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,350
Back.

1018
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,000
Back.

1019
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,100
Back.
Yes... master.

1020
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,850
He thinks I'm Dracula.

1021
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,950
Whew!
Well, we got him!

1022
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,200
Joan! Joan!

1023
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,700
Are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

1024
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,800
McDougal!

1025
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,650
I gotcha.
You're just the one we're lookin' for.
Still want your exhibits?

1026
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,250
Of course I do.
Here comes one of 'em now!

1027
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,300
Aah!

1028
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:38,050
Chick!
Come on, Wilbur!

1029
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,500
Fill that bucket with gas.

1030
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,200
Untie the boat.

1031
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:57,950
Untie the boat!

1032
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,500
Untie the boat, will ya?

1033
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,950
Untie the boat, will ya please?

1034
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,900
Okay!

1035
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,950
He won't chase us anymore. And another thing, Mr. Chick Young,

1036
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,250
the next time I tell you that I saw something when I saw it,

1037
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,950
you believe me that I saw it!
Oh, relax.

1038
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:06,250
Now that we've seen the last of Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Monster,

1039
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:08,250
there's nobody to frighten us anymore.

1040
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,200
That's too bad. I was hoping to get in on the excitement.

1041
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:15,500
Who said that?
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the Invisible Man.
