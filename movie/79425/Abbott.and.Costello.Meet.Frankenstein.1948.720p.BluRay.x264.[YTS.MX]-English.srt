1
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,301
Operator, haven't you been able
to get me the express office

2
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,135
at Islamorada, Florida yet?

3
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,648
Yes, I know it takes time to
call from London to the States.

4
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,567
But please hurry.
It's terribly important!

5
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,103
Answer that phone.

6
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,314
Answer the bell!

7
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,320
Answer the phone!

8
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,327
Which do you want me to answer first'?
Both of 'em.

9
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,743
Both of 'em.
Both of 'em!

10
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,793
Hold the line,
please. Thank you.

11
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,129
I'd like to have my grip, please.
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,754
Let me see that. Well, they
came in on the last train.

13
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,506
We haven't unloaded the truck yet.
Go out and get the lady's grip.

14
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,304
Hurry up.

15
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,384
Excuse me... Excuse me, please.

16
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,442
Lady, here's your bag.

17
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,127
What are you trying to do,
ruin the lady's baggage?

18
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,028
Where is it?
This one.

19
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,201
There you are, Madam. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

20
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,703
Now come on, clean this all up.
Come on, straighten it out.

21
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,081
Wilbur, darling,
are you all right?

22
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,169
Sandra, I hurt my
poor little head.

23
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,046
Your head?

24
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,293
Oh no.

25
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,555
Does this hurt'?
Uh-uh.

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,883
Does that hurt'?
Uh-uh.

27
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,513
Thank heaven.

28
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:42,473
If anything happened to you,
dearest, I'd never forgive myself.

29
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,856
That kiss made
everything all better.

30
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,232
You worry about me
an awful lot, don't you?

31
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,814
You mean an awful lot to me.

32
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,239
Tell me more.

33
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,117
I will.
At dinner tonight.

34
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,193
<i>Okay.</i>

35
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,869
Come on, gel up out of
there and go to work!

36
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,042
That is, if your head
doesn't bother you too much.

37
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,041
His head is all right. It is, eh?
But is your head all right?

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,669
Certainly.
Frankly, I don't get it.

39
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,842
And frankly, you never will.

40
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,509
I can't understand that dame.

41
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,388
Of all the guys around here, that classy
dish has to pick out a guy like you.

42
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,432
What's wrong with that? Go look at
yourself in the mirror sometime.

43
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,831
Why should I hurt
my own feelings?

44
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,235
Go answer the phone.
Go ahead, I'll pick these up.

45
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,482
Baggage room.

46
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,535
London? Calling here?

47
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,613
This ain't collect, is it'?

48
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,040
Oh, all right. Put him on.

49
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:47,546
Hello? Do you have two crates addressed
to the McDougal House of Horrors?

50
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,169
What's the number on the checks?
Never mind that.

51
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,586
Tonight, the moon will be full here.
I haven't much time.

52
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,047
Now, listen closely. I'm
flying out of here at dawn.

53
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,226
Under no circumstances are you to
deliver those crates until I arrive.

54
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
Understand? Under...

55
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,488
Mr. McDougal, will you
stop gargling your throat?

56
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,559
Hey, you'll have to get your
dog away from the phone.

57
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,602
I can't hear a word
you're sayin'.

58
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,576
You're awful silly to call me
all the way from London,

59
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
just to have your
dog talk to me.

60
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,201
That's great conversation.
The guy growls like a wolf.

61
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,082
The nerve of some people!

62
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,677
Well, what can I do for you, bub?
I'm in a hurry.

63
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,920
I have two crates here addressed
to my House of Horrors,

64
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,623
and I want immediate delivery.
My name's McDougal.

65
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,767
McDougal? But, I just talked to
you on the telephone from London.

66
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,602
How'd you get here so fast?
They shoot you out of a cannon?

67
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,549
Are you crazy? I've
been here all the time.

68
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,880
Now, get me those crates!

69
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,315
How long you been here?
Five minutes.

70
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,859
What are you beefing about?
I've been here five years,

71
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,402
you don't see me going around
like that and yelling...

72
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,696
There's the insurance slip and
there's the bill of lading.

73
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,688
Now get me those crates!

74
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,640
Look, will you
please stop yellin'?

75
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,648
Come here. You know, it's
impolite to raise your voice.

76
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,194
Oh, Chick!

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,873
Why didn't you give me
these in the first place?

78
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,650
Chi... Chick, this man
wants these crates.

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,028
Hmm. Insured for $20,000.
We'd better look these up.

80
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,831
Must be valuable.
I'll say they're valuable.

81
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,786
Wilbur?
Yes, Sandra?

82
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,617
He's busy,
he's busy. Please.

83
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,499
That little fellow's impossible.
Hurry up with those crates!

84
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,750
Do you know what I've got in there, miss?
Haven't the slightest idea.

85
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,676
Just the greatest attraction the House
of Horrors ever had, that's all.

86
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,052
One of them's a coffin containing the
remains of the original Count Dracula.

87
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,552
And the other's the body
of the Frankenstein Monster.

88
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,892
Guess that combination's
enough to scare the pants...

89
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,065
I mean, shirt right off
your back, ain't it?

90
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,026
I don't scare easily. Neither
do I, where money's concerned.

91
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,402
I got 'em dirt cheap. European agent
picked my name right out of thin air.

92
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,949
Very interesting.
Yeah.

93
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,782
Mr. McDougal.

94
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,956
Hey, Chick, here's one.

95
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,749
Darling...
Yeah?

96
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,872
Darling, I have to run along.
Somethings come up.

97
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,330
That means we'll have to
break our date tonight.

98
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,416
It ain't another man, is it?
Of course not.

99
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,133
Silly boy.
Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,679
Boy, I'm floatin'
on a cloud of love.

101
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,226
Listen, you little blimp,

102
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,905
I'll let the air out of you in a
minute, if you don't give me a hand.

103
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,604
You understand that?
Thank you.

104
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,227
Boy, is this kid lost.

105
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,688
Come here. Take that rope
and get up on top that box,

106
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,915
and tie it to that
handle up there.

107
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,907
Okay. Nothing
matters no more.

108
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,699
I'm so happy.
Go on, get up there!

109
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,087
Here it is.

110
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,708
Hold still now.

111
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,668
Oh!

112
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,380
Chick!

113
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,341
Stop him! Is he
trying to ruin me?

114
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,176
Keep your shirt on.
You're insured.

115
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,388
Yes, and if those exhibits are
damaged, I intend to collect.

116
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,149
Well, there you are. Shall I wrap it up?
No, you idiot.

117
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,124
You're gonna take those down to my
House of Horrors and uncrate them.

118
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,667
Because if that's the way
you handle baggage,

119
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,919
I'm going to have the insurance
agent there to inspect them

120
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,320
before I accept delivery.

121
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,202
Well, then it's gonna cost you
overtime because I'm a union man.

122
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,079
And I work only 16 hours a day.

123
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,536
A union man only works
eight hours a day.

124
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,212
I belong to two unions!

125
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,086
Get those down to my place!
All right.

126
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,555
Hey, Wilbur, here's a key.
Open the door.

127
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,412
I'm not gonna like this.
Come on, gimme a hand.

128
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,914
Come on, get it inside.

129
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,246
Well, pull it! You want
me to do all the work?

130
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,502
Come on, help
me with it, will ya?

131
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,757
Oh...

132
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,308
What's the matter now?

133
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,803
Somebody's got a knife in my back.
Oh, nonsense!

134
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,514
Where's the switch?
Here.

135
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,602
Sandra should see you now.

136
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,356
Turn around. Look what
you're afraid of.

137
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,655
Turn around!

138
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,332
Come on, get up on your feet.
It's only a dummy.

139
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,705
Dummy nothin'. It was
smart enough to scare me.

140
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,585
Come on, get a hold
of the box. Go ahead.

141
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,172
All right, come on,
swing it around.

142
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,966
Well, help a little bit!

143
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,965
Oh, oh!

144
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,638
Come on, you fraidy-cat.
These things can't harm ya.

145
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,014
They're made out of wax.

146
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,722
You know, people pay McDougal <i>cash</i>
to come in here and get scared?

147
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,574
I'm cheatin' him. I'm
gettin' scared for nothin'.

148
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,023
Go ahead and push, now.
Don't knock anything over.

149
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,106
There we are. Now, we get the
dolly out from underneath there.

150
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,067
Lift up that end.
Lift it up!

151
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,494
Come on, come on.

152
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,488
There you are.

153
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,418
Well, put it down, put it down.
Do I have to do all the work?

154
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,244
I'll get it down.
Well, put it down.

155
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,171
Go ahead.
Now, open it up.

156
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,501
I'm going out and get the other crate.
And no back talk!

157
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,562
I've got just two words to say to you.
What is that?

158
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,839
Hurry back.

159
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,110
Hello? Yes, Mr. McDougal.

160
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,860
Yeah, the crates are here.
Wilbur's opening one right now.

161
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,067
Everything's all right.

162
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,903
Okay, Mr. McDougal.
Goodbye.

163
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,083
Chick? Oh, Chick!

164
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,807
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

165
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,708
Did you turn out the light?
Certainly not.

166
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,543
They're out.
So what'?

167
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,971
Maybe the lightning struck
the power line or something.

168
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,673
I get in more messes
around here...

169
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,099
Never mind,
take off that canvas.

170
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,643
Take it off'?
Take it off!

171
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,358
Hey, a coffin!
Coffin.

172
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,605
The Dracula crest.
Dracula's crest.

173
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:14,158
I wonder if Mr. McDougal expects people
to think that Dracula's really in there.

174
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,361
No, don't. Please don't.

175
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:21,575
Oh, now come, come, come. Dracula
was just a legendary character.

176
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,285
He never existed.
No?

177
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,665
Certainly not.

178
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,213
Fold up this canvas. I'm going
out and get the other crate.

179
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,132
If you want me, just holler. Holler,
"Oh, Chick!" You understand?

180
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,425
Oh, Chick!
What do you want?

181
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,503
What kepi you?
I haven't left yet.

182
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,054
The next time,
don't take so long.

183
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,348
Come on. Fold this up. Get busy.

184
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:56,197
“Count Dracula sleeps in this coffin,
but rises every night at sunset."

185
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,321
Chick is right.
This is awful silly stuff.

186
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,742
"Dracula..." ..

187
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,754
Chick! Chick!

188
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,689
What's the matter now? You
know that person you said that

189
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,885
there's no such person?
Yes?

190
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,466
I think he's
in there, in person.

191
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,723
I was reading this sign over here, this
one down here, "Dracula's Legend."

192
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,842
All of a sudden I heard...

193
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,099
That's the wind.
It should get oiled.

194
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,775
Listen, stop reading this thing.

195
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,650
That's a lot of phony baloney
to fool McDougal's customers.

196
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,824
Now, fold up that canvas.
Get busy. Come on.

197
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,625
"Dracula can change himself
at will into a vampire bat,

198
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,045
"flying about
the countryside."

199
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,594
Flying.

200
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,380
<i>Waco...</i>

201
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,386
Chick!

202
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,014
Chick!

203
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,521
Listen, you're making enough
noise to wake up the dead!

204
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,773
I don't have to wake him up.
He's up. I saw a hand.

205
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,230
You saw a hand? Where?
Right over there.

206
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,486
Let me see it.
Right over here.

207
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,238
Where is it'?
I saw a hand there!

208
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,544
You don't know what
you're talking about!

209
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,742
You're all excited reading this legend.
Now, listen. Listen, Wilbur.

210
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,698
I know there's no such
a person as Dracula.

211
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,001
You know there's no
such a person as Dracula.

212
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,579
But does Dracula know it?
Now, listen to me.

213
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,514
McDougal will be here any minute
with the insurance agent.

214
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,165
Now get to work!

215
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:56,029
"He keeps himself alive by
drinking the blood..."

216
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,666
Chick. Chick.

217
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,248
Chick.

218
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,505
Chick. Ch...

219
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,133
Chick!

220
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,097
Now, listen, this is
getting to be ridiculous.

221
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,352
What? What?

222
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,106
Are you trying to tell
me that candle moved?

223
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,275
Look, wait a minute. Candles can't move!
This one did.

224
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,857
Yeah, there. Watch it.
Keep your eye on it.

225
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,238
Is it moving? Huh?

226
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,111
It's not moving, is it? Not now.

227
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,915
Well, use your brains a little bit.
Let's get this job finished.

228
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,307
"He keeps himself alive by drinking
the blood of his victims."

229
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:15,192
"Count Dracula must return to his
coffin before sunrise. He..."

230
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,231
Chick! Chick!

231
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,411
Oh, Chick! Chick!

232
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,411
Chick!

233
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,082
Oh, Chick, come on!
Come on!

234
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,417
All right, I'm comin'.

235
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,834
Come on, will ya! Now, wait a minute.
What's wrong now?

236
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,466
Oh, Chick!

237
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,839
You gonna tell me that candle moved again?
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,232
I told you not to
read this, didn't I'?

239
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,509
I can't help it. I can't help it.
Oh, stop.

240
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,970
"Count Dracula must return
to his coffin before sunrise,

241
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,597
"where he lies helpless
during the day."

242
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,895
That's the bunk! That's
what I'm trying to tell ya.

243
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,102
That's his bunk!

244
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,525
Come here.

245
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,025
Oh, don't, Chick. Come here. Come here!
Come around here!

246
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,112
Come over here.
Look in there.

247
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,115
Now, do you see anything?

248
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,250
No.
Certainly not.

249
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,044
Come on, help me open
that crate. Come on.

250
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,956
Come on, get with it,
will you please?

251
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:21,879
Come on, get with it,
will you please?

252
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,052
You can always...

253
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,597
"Frankenstein's Monster." Get a
load of this here. Come here.

254
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,300
"A scientist named
Frankenstein made a monster

255
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,762
"by sewing together parts
of old, dead bodies."

256
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,489
Do you have to read that stuff'?
Wait a minute.

257
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:40,314
"Frankenstein gave the monster eternal
life by shooting it full of electricity.

258
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,068
"Some people claim it is not
dead even now, just dormant."

259
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,276
Now, who'd be silly enough
to believe that?

260
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,412
Who would be silly enough
to believe that? Yeah.

261
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,001
Me.

262
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,422
Come on, open up that crate.

263
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,358
Chick, did you hear that?

264
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,937
Yeah, I heard you pulling the
nails out, certainly. Go ahead.

265
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,364
Pulling the nails?

266
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,916
Chick?
Oh, quiet.

267
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,836
I don't want to hear any more
of your foolish questions.

268
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,380
Come on, open up
the crate, will you?

269
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,591
There we are.

270
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,890
You've got it.
Now get a hold of it.

271
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,343
Throw it right on the side.

272
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,930
That's it, fine. Now, come on,
help me with this excelsior.

273
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,857
Come on, take it all
out. Get it off him.

274
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,940
Wow! Look out!
Chick, cover it up!

275
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,538
What's the matter? Wait a minute.
Cover it up!

276
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,362
Cover the whole...
What's the matter with you?

277
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,945
Stop that!

278
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,241
Now you did it.

279
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,298
Hey, what are you doing
in there with the lights off?

280
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,416
Hey, McDougal!
Now we're in trouble.

281
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,835
Hide that head.
Hurry up! Hurry up!

282
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,644
Master.

283
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,647
Yes.

284
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,232
Come. Follow me.

285
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,621
Don't be afraid.
He won't hurt you.

286
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,418
Come!

287
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,957
Hurry up. Come.

288
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,218
This better be a good one.

289
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:20,093
What's the matter, you
afraid of the dark'? No.

290
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,634
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

291
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,605
What is this?

292
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,604
Hey, Wilbur, McDougal is here. I...
What's the matter with you?

293
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,855
Come on, snap out of it.

294
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,078
Where are they?
Where are my bodies?

295
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,422
What bodies?
There were no bodies.

296
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,414
We opened both crates. I showed
it to Wilbur. Look in there.

297
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,916
If they're not here, where are they?
I don't know.

298
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,540
They must be stolen.
My company inspected

299
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,919
the contents before
they were shipped.

300
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,379
Then they must've
been stolen en route.

301
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,451
<i>You mean, you saw mam'?
No, no, no.</i>

302
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,091
Well, then where did they go?
I don't know.

303
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,459
If they're gone, I want my
insurance money. I'm sorry.

304
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,787
My company doesn't pay off
until a full investigation.

305
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,430
Did you hear that? If you
don't produce those bodies,

306
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,671
I'm going to call the police!

307
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,341
Police?
Police!

308
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,136
I can do better
than that. Police!

309
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,712
I'll get you.
Police!

310
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,094
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come on, go, get on.

311
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,316
Let's take it out.

312
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,697
Come!

313
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,221
Good evening,
Dr. Mornay.

314
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,179
My dear Count, it's so
good to see you again.

315
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,435
And you look more charming
than when I saw you last.

316
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,732
Come in, Count Dracula.
Thank you, Sandra.

317
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,484
But the name
is Dr. Lejos.

318
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,065
I wouldn't want to frighten
your technical assistant.

319
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,320
Professor Stevens?

320
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,196
Don't worry. He's completely
engrossed in his work.

321
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,246
Besides, he should be
out of here by tomorrow.

322
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,448
Excellent

323
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,160
Yes, except that he's asking
too many questions.

324
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,417
I will take care of that.
Is everything else arranged?

325
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,090
Yes. Where did you leave him?
In the cold.

326
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,792
I'll get a wrap.

327
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,311
Nervous, my dear?

328
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,735
This is risky business.

329
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,859
Not as risky as those curious
operations of yours,

330
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:29,071
that so intrigued the European police.
Yet much more profitable.

331
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:33,791
Restore the monster for me, and
you shall have anything you wish.

332
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,873
In that case, we better
start as soon as possible.

333
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,456
It's dangerous to leave him
in this weakened condition.

334
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,925
Have you mastered Dr.
Frankenstein's notebook?

335
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,971
Let me get my hand on a scalpel
again and you shall see.

336
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,049
And about the brain?

337
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:53,932
I don't want to repeat Frankenstein's
mistake, and revive a vicious,

338
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,638
unmanageable brute.

339
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,437
This time the monster must
have no will of his own.

340
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,941
No fiendish intellect
to oppose his master.

341
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,820
There, my dear Count, I believe I
have exceeded your fondest wishes.

342
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,452
The new brain I've chosen
for the monster is so simple,

343
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,997
so pliable, he will obey
you like a trained dog.

344
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:18,040
Good. How soon?

345
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,123
The day after tomorrow. Wilbur was
taking me to a masquerade ball.

346
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:26,006
But I'm sure he'd prefer to
spend a quiet evening at home.

347
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,554
Bring him through here.

348
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,268
I tell you, Chick, I saw
what I saw when I saw it!

349
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,776
Keep quiet! You babbling about
dead people walking away!

350
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,528
That's why we were arrested
and thrown in jail.

351
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,111
Do you realize that we've spent
a whole day and night in jail?

352
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,698
And we'd still be there if some
dame hadn't've bailed us out.

353
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,456
Chick, now stop calling
Sandra a dame!

354
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,542
And I'm tellin' ya,
they were there.

355
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,465
Oh, stop.
Two of 'em.

356
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,919
One of 'em was
about eight foot tall.

357
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,380
Way up there!
And he walked like this.

358
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,562
Just like that.

359
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,524
Now, that's the way he walked.
Stop it.

360
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,079
You don't believe that?
Certainly not!

361
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,145
Well, I saw it.

362
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,778
And the other one,
he went like this.

363
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,497
And he kept gettin'
closer and closer.

364
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,576
He had eyes that
were balls of fire.

365
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,917
He kept staring, eye to eye.

366
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,466
Eye to eye! Staring!

367
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,352
I never saw anything
like it in my life.

368
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,301
Believe me, Chick, when I tell
you I was scared to death.

369
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,260
Really I was. I was
really scared, Chick.

370
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,354
What's the matter? Chick?

371
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,187
What did I do?

372
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:09,864
Hey, Chick, I don't like you like that.
Come on, be just like you used to be.

373
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,025
Go away with it!
Attaboy! I'm happy.

374
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,294
That's just like you used to be.

375
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,241
All right. Now, stop this nonsense!
All of it.

376
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,089
You're Wilbur Grey?
Yes, sir.

377
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,840
Then you must be Chick Young.
So what?

378
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:31,339
I'm Lawrence Talbot. I've been
looking all over town for you.

379
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,885
You didn't have to look far.
We were in jail. Yes, I know.

380
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,807
You see, I'm the one who telephoned
you not to deliver those bodies.

381
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,887
I knew they were alive!

382
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,822
There you are, so you thought
I was imagining things, huh?

383
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,574
When I told you about the fellow
that was eight-foot tall,

384
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,785
and walking like this with the stiff legs,
and then the other fellow with this here.

385
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,938
Wait! Wait a minute. You're
crazy, and so is this screwball!

386
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,738
Look, bub, I have my own troubles.
Worse than you think.

387
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,784
I followed Dracula all
the way from Europe,

388
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,115
because I believe that he's going to try
and revive the Frankenstein monster.

389
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,576
We must find him and destroy
him before he can do this!

390
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,832
Wait a minute, why don't
you go down to the police,

391
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,056
tell them you know the story
about Dracula and the Monster.

392
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,459
They'd be very interested.
I can't do that.

393
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,133
Because then I'd have to
tell them who I am and...

394
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,182
Why I know what I know.

395
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,265
Soon... Soon the
moon will rise.

396
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,069
I haven't time to explain.

397
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,774
I've taken the room across the hall.
Here's the key. Lock me in!

398
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,279
Lock you in?
Yes, please. Hurry!

399
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,033
It's silly, but I'll do it.

400
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,989
He's scared too.

401
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,790
Remember, no matter what
you hear or what happens,

402
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,712
don't let me out!

403
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,314
“Lock me in." That guy is
screwier than you are.

404
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,441
He is not.
He's a nice man.

405
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,649
He's just worried about the police getting
him because he knows they're alive.

406
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,576
I'm going to bed.
Well...

407
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,742
Hey, he forgot his bag.

408
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,286
Mr. Talbot,
you forgot your grip.

409
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,292
Mr. Talbot?

410
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,260
Mr. Talbot?

411
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,134
Mr. Talbot?

412
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,611
Now, how'd he get out of here?

413
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,694
Hmm.

414
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,246
I'll leave him a note.

415
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:15,295
"I left your bag in the bedroom.

416
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,419
"Wilbur."

417
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,743
I wonder if he counted these.

418
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,704
He might've.

419
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,316
Maybe he didn't

420
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,229
Hmm.

421
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,117
A fine insurance company
I'm doing business with,

422
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,035
outsmarted by
a couple of morons!

423
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,622
Those two crooks got
out of jail. On bail!

424
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,916
We know that, Mr. McDougal,
but you see we...

425
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,336
In fact, I arranged it.
You? Who are you?

426
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,460
This is Miss Raymond, an
investigator from the home office.

427
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,510
It's my job, Mr. McDougal, to
find those missing exhibits.

428
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,932
I'm quite sure I can persuade the chubby
little fellow to lead me right to them.

429
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,557
Naturally, I couldn't persuade
him very well in jail.

430
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,103
Wilbur, please! I've had
nightmares all night long!

431
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,951
I don't want to hear any
more about dead bodies.

432
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,648
I saw what I saw when I saw it.

433
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,570
All right.

434
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,233
Boy, am I glad to see you. Will
you go over and talk to that guy?

435
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,611
Sandra! Wilbur darling,
I heard what happened.

436
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,493
That's awful. They can't put
my little Wilbur in jail.

437
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,994
They can't, but they did.

438
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,576
Sandra, I wanna thank
you for bailing us out.

439
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,707
I? I only learned
about it this morning.

440
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,477
Well, didn't the policeman tell
you that a lady bailed us out?

441
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,291
He did.

442
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,761
Wilbur, pet' you haven't been
untrue to your Sandra'?

443
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,466
Sandra, how can you look me
in the face and say that?

444
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,927
How can you look him
in the face, period?

445
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,973
I only came by to remind you about
the masquerade ball tonight.

446
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,184
I was just getting ready
to pick up my costume.

447
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:42,066
Come by for me early,
dearest. About sunset.

448
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,441
Alone. Goodbye.

449
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,947
What I'd like to know is, what
has he got that I haven't got?

450
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,539
A brain.

451
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,920
Brain. I'd like to
know where it is.

452
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,669
(KNOCK ON DOOR} Oh. She
forgot to kiss me goodbye.

453
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,634
Now, who is this? She's... She's...
She's beautiful.

454
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,561
I'm Joan Raymond.
She's Joan Raymond.

455
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,231
I'm the girl who arranged
your release from jail.

456
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,809
Well, why should you
want to spring us?

457
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,562
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

458
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,115
Well! As long as you
put it that way, I...

459
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,739
That's what happened to me.

460
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,321
Wilbur, darling!

461
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:40,128
Miss Raymond, when did this mad
feeling first come over you?

462
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,456
The instant I saw you
in the baggage room.

463
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,715
I knew then that I wanted to spend every
single minute that I'm in town with you.

464
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,295
You did?

465
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,755
What are we doing tonight?

466
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,636
He's going to a masquerade ball.

467
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,134
But I'm not doing anything.

468
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,061
In that case, you'll be awfully lonesome.
Well, naturally...

469
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:01,396
Wilbur darling, I haven't been
to a masquerade ball in ages.

470
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,272
I was just hoping you'd ask me.

471
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,228
Wilbur! Come here.

472
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,197
Miss Raymond'
will you excuse me?

473
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,280
Oh, you irresistible boy!

474
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:19,577
Do you want me? Yes, I want you.
Come over here.

475
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,171
I just wanted to get a good
look at you in the light.

476
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,332
I still don't get it.
Jealous?

477
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,635
Wilbur, I'll have to go
out and get a costume.

478
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,804
That's funny. I was
just going, too.

479
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,634
I'll go down to my room and pick up a
couple things and meet you in the lobby.

480
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,014
All right. In the lobby.

481
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,391
I'll get my hat and coat.
I'll be right with you.

482
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,814
Excuse me.
Look.

483
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,984
Now you've got two dates. What
about Sandra, you bigamist?

484
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,609
Sandra? I don't know.
Joan is awful cute.

485
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,733
All right, you take Joan, I'll take Sandra.
Oh, Sandra sends me-

486
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,451
Well, then I'll take Joan.
Joan sends me too.

487
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,403
Now, listen, you
sawed-off Romeo,

488
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,567
in a minute, I'll send you!

489
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,241
You don't even appeal to me.

490
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,456
Look, Wilbur, we've always
been pals, haven't we?

491
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,878
Oh, yes.
We've always shared,

492
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,963
and shared alike, haven't we?

493
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,542
Well, now, look, let's be reasonable.
Come on.

494
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,635
I've always shared with you.
That you have!

495
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,346
If I had two cigarettes, I'd give you one.
That's right.

496
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,461
And if I had two pair of
shoes, I'd give you a pair.

497
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,193
Don't I know that?
And if I have two girls...

498
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,015
Well?

499
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,365
Why don't you light that cigarette, put on
those shoes and take a walk for yourself?

500
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,187
That's what I'm going
to do, but with you.

501
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,458
This key don't fit.
This is... Talbot's key.

502
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,376
Hey, we forgot about him.

503
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,965
Boy, what a bender he
must've been on last night!

504
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,556
Hey, Mr. Talbot.
Mr. Talbot!

505
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,818
And I thought you were such a
nice man, too. Look at yourself.

506
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,267
You're a mess!
Last night...

507
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,062
I went through another
of my horrible experiences.

508
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,853
Years ago I was
bitten by a werewolf.

509
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,906
Ever since, when
the full moon rises,

510
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,075
I turn into a wolf myself.

511
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,654
Oh, pal, that's all right.

512
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:24,626
I'm sort of a wolf myself.
And here I thought...

513
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,454
I thought that you were the
only one that would believe me,

514
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:31,508
that you were the one that
knew that I spoke the truth.

515
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,178
You have seen the living dead.
Mm-hmm.

516
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,591
I came all the way from Europe,

517
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,974
because Dracula and the
Monster must be destroyed.

518
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,929
Together we must find them!

519
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,408
Oh no, now, wait a minute. Let's
not start that all over again.

520
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,106
I can't go. I've got a date.
In fact, I've got two dates.

521
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:54,531
But you and I have
a date with destiny.

522
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,950
Let Chick go with destiny.

523
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,403
Won't you please?

524
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,039
You two kids stay here.
I'm going up and get Sandra.

525
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,718
She's mine too.

526
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,595
Pardon me just
a minute. Wilbur!

527
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,097
Now, look, you've
got Joan and Sandra.

528
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,721
You've got two girls! How about
the two girls we had last week?

529
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:26,844
Let's not talk about that.

530
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,324
You got no kick comin'.
I'm not kicking.

531
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,850
You had the best lookin' one.
So what?

532
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,565
You rs had teeth. Look,
Wilbur, yours had teeth too.

533
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,330
Did you see that tooth?
Yes, I happened to see it.

534
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,999
Mine had so much bridgework, every
time I kissed her I had to pay toll.

535
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,240
What's the use?

536
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,703
Wilbur, can't we both
go along, too?

537
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,952
Yes, mon amour. That's Spanish.
That's French.

538
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:49,328
How do you like that? I speak French too.
Oh, you cute little devil!

539
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,170
Stop that.

540
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,170
Come on, lead the way.
Come on.

541
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,728
Hello.
Hello.

542
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,438
Is Sandra in?
Who?

543
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,741
Sandra. You mean, Dr. Mornay?

544
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,285
Well, if that's what she is, I'm
just what the doctor ordered.

545
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,287
Come in.
Thank you.

546
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,249
I thought this Sandra
was your date.

547
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,918
Or did we both come along
for the ride? No, no.

548
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,918
Perhaps I should introduce myself.
I'm Professor Stevens.

549
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,422
This is Miss Raymond, This is
Wilbur Grey, and I'm Chick Young.

550
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,928
How do you do, Miss Raymond?
How do you do?

551
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,802
I have work to finish, but it shouldn't
take more than a few minutes.

552
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,441
If you'll wait in the
library, I'll be right down.

553
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,264
Just to keep the records clear.
We're here to pick up Sandra.

554
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,472
Of course. I'm sure she's
around somewhere.

555
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,941
Wilbur!

556
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,610
Sandra, hello.

557
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,484
That girl, who is she?

558
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,150
She's Chick's date. She's going
to the masquerade with us.

559
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,533
But I told you to come here alone.
We'll have to get rid of them.

560
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,240
I'll have to get
rid of somebody.

561
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,459
Hello, Sandra.
Hello, Chick.

562
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,162
Joan, this is Sandra.
Sandra, Joan.

563
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,632
Nice place you have here, Doctor.
Who told you I was a doctor?

564
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,376
Why, the young man
who answered the door.

565
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,803
Oh, Professor Stevens.

566
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,008
I'm on a vacation, you see,
and traveling incognito.

567
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,056
What are you doing here?
Same thing.

568
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,107
Shall we get going? Just as
soon <i>as</i> I put on my costume.

569
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,186
Would you like to powder your nose?
I'd love to.

570
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,568
I'll be right back, Wilbur.

571
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,196
I'll be right back, too, Wilbur.

572
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,782
Toodle-oo!

573
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:56,250
Chick, there's a time in everyone's
life when they get in trouble.

574
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,373
I'm in a mess of it right now.
Now, what's wrong?

575
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,255
I've got two girls.
You know the old saying?

576
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,961
"Everything
comes in threes."

577
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,217
Now, suppose a third girl
should fall in love with you?

578
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,550
What's her name?
We'll say her name is Mary.

579
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,306
Is she pretty?
Beautiful.

580
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,058
Naturally, she'd have to be.

581
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,935
Now you have Mary, you have
Joan and you have Sandra.

582
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,730
So, to prove to you that I'm
your pal, your bosom friend,

583
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,732
I'll take one of
the girls off your hands.

584
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,566
Chick, you're what I call a real pal.
It's all right.

585
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,067
You take Mary.

586
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,121
We better answer that phone.
They're all upstairs.

587
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,744
Hello.
Hello?

588
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,292
Is Dr. Lejos there?

589
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,428
Just a minute. Somebody wants
to know about a Dr. Lejos.

590
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,452
I don't know him.

591
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,960
<i>Hello? Who is this speaking?
This is</i> Wilbur Grey.

592
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,043
I thought I recognized
your voice.

593
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,470
This is Talbot speaking.

594
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,595
Listen. I just got a line
on Dracula and the Monster.

595
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,688
<i>A certain Dr. Lejos has been receiving
a lot of electrical equipment,</i>

596
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,766
just the type necessary
to revive the Monster.

597
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,606
So what? I'm way
out on an island.

598
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,063
I've got my own problems.
Yes, but listen.

599
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:07,362
I believe you're in the
house of Dracula right now.

600
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,736
You can find the
Monster, and I'll...

601
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,697
Hello?

602
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,157
<i>Wilbur!</i>

603
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,787
Come here!

604
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,027
Chick, you don't know what
you're doin', son!

605
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,167
What's the matter with you?
Quiet. Come here.

606
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,474
You didn't hang up the phone.
Let him hang up the phone.

607
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,499
Who?
Dracula.

608
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,903
Dracula and the
Monster live here.

609
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,929
Wait a minute. Don't start that again.
Who told you that?

610
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,219
Talbot. He also said that
we got to search the place.

611
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,345
Come here.

612
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,392
Come over here.

613
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,600
Now, listen, Talbot, enough is enough.
Now, Wilbur's scared to.-.

614
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,182
Hello? Hello'? He's gone.
So am I.

615
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,660
No, you don't. Come here. I'm gonna
settle this thing once and for all.

616
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,437
We'll search this place. Look,
Chick, it's a little past sunset,

617
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,739
and if Dracula is here, he's
gonna be wanting breakfast.

618
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,067
And I'm fatter than you,
and it ain't gonna be me!

619
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,490
Now, just a minute. Just a minute.
It ain't gonna be me!

620
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,039
Wait a minute, I'm gonna prove just how
crazy both you and Talbot really are.

621
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,082
We'll search this place,
right from the basement.

622
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,159
Look, Chick.
What?

623
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,303
We'll search it.
That's more...

624
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,637
You and I together.
Now we're talkin'.

625
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,639
Attaboy. You search the
basement, I'll search outside.

626
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,016
Oh, no, you don't!
All right, then,

627
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,642
I'll search on outside,
and you search the basement.

628
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,713
That's different.

629
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,046
It worked!
Come on!

630
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,549
Now, let's look around here.

631
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,681
There's some doors down there.

632
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,988
You think we oughta tell
Sandra where we're goin'?

633
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,264
Certainly not.

634
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,480
You look over there.

635
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,622
Well?
Broom closet.

636
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,291
What?

637
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,621
Broom closet? Look out.

638
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,705
Come on.

639
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,342
Broom closet?

640
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,380
Come on!
Wait for me.

641
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,931
Come on.

642
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,525
Oh!

643
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,822
Chick! Open!

644
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,120
Whoa!

645
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,381
Chick! Come on. Chick!

646
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,011
Chick! You search down there
and on the inside. Shh.

647
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,895
Stop!
It's the truth. Come here.

648
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,729
All I did was like this.

649
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,542
Now, Chick, I tell you,
right over there.

650
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,783
Where are they?
Where are they?

651
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,780
They're in there. They're in there.
Now, listen.

652
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,031
Wait a minute. I'm gonna look around.
You go ahead.

653
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,913
If I don't find anybody,
I'm gonna beat your ears off.

654
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,511
I'm telling you, Chick. Honest.
Well, wait here.

655
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,039
They're over there. Oh, no. I ain't
goin' near that place anymore.

656
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,964
Whoa! Ooh!

657
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,724
Open sesame!
Open sesame!

658
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,244
Well, where are they?
They must be in there.

659
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:52,545
Oh, stop. Now, listen Wilbur, I'm getting sick
and tired of this silly nonsense of yours.

660
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,999
- Some guy going around...
- No, no.

661
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,006
Another guy goin'...
No, no!

662
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,008
The one guy goes...
The big...

663
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:04,216
And the other guy,
not like that, like this.

664
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,552
Yeah. All right, all right, all right.
Put your hands down.

665
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,980
Come on, the girls are waiting
for us upstairs. Come on.

666
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,314
Have you known Wilbur long?
Yes, we're old friends.

667
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,817
Will you belong?
Just a few minutes.

668
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,794
Miss Raymond?
Yes?

669
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,874
I'm ready. Shall we go?

670
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,625
Of course.

671
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,302
Here's your purse, dear.
Thank you.

672
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,189
Who screamed?
You did!

673
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,271
I did?

674
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,360
Now, listen, Wilbur, if you don't
stop imagining these crazy things,

675
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,491
I'll take you to a doctor
to have you examined.

676
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,591
But I'm telling you, I saw them. And when
I see what I see, I saw it. That's all.

677
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,259
Because Mr. Talbot,
same way, he saw it too.

678
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:57,253
Talbot! He's crazy.
You're both crazy!

679
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,170
Sandra.

680
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,345
Sandra, I've just gotta tell you.
I was downstairs in the basement.

681
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,344
Basement? And what were
you doing down there?

682
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,855
I opened the door.
He opened the door'

683
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,051
and fell down the stairs.

684
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,303
Fibber.
How careless!

685
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:15,184
You should be careful! A person
can get killed that way!

686
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,185
I hope you weren't
disturbed, Dr. Lejos.

687
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,733
It's perfectly all right,
my dear. Introduce me.

688
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,652
This is Miss Raymond.
Mr. Young.

689
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,317
And this is Wilbur.

690
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:29,156
Ah, Wilbur! Why!

691
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,285
I heard so much about you, I
feel <i>as</i> if we have already met.

692
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:39,546
And I must say, my dear, I approve
very highly of your choice.

693
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,375
What we need today
is young blood.

694
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,380
And brains!

695
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,558
Oh, don't be bashful. Come.

696
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:57,063
Hello, Dr. Lejos. I've been
looking for you all clay.

697
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,325
You know, every time I ask Dr. Mornay what
that equipment is going to be used for,

698
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:01,692
she says to ask you.

699
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,519
Of course.

700
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,151
Didn't I hear that you were
going to masquerade ball?

701
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,822
Yes, we have our costumes out in the boat.
Oh, you young people!

702
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:14,618
Making the most
of life, while ii lasts.

703
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,915
Thank you.

704
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,377
Professor, you've
worked hard and well.

705
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:24,377
Why don't you join them, and save
your questions until tomorrow?

706
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:29,053
Under ordinary circumstances I'd
say no, but... If you don't mind?

707
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,802
Not at all.
Good. I'll get my coal.

708
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,265
Of course that would make
too many for one boat.

709
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,644
But if the professor and this lady
and gentleman go on ahead, sure.

710
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,693
Wilbur and Dr. Mornay can...
I'm afraid I can't.

711
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,110
What's the matter?

712
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,313
I've suddenly developed
a splitting headache.

713
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,324
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you'll
have to go without me.

714
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,902
Nonsense! It will pass
as quickly as it came.

715
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:56,660
It's no use, Doctor. I shall
have to go directly to bed.

716
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:02,670
Pardon me. Well, Chick,
there goes your date.

717
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,170
Now then, what
was that all about?

718
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,129
This thing is too dangerous. The
girl is an insurance investigator.

719
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,384
Stevens is asking
too many questions.

720
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,013
And Wilbur was up to
something in the basement.

721
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,388
I think we ought to wait.

722
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,439
And jeopardize the success
of the operation? Never!

723
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,311
I must warn you, my dear Sandra,

724
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,735
I am accustomed
to having my orders obeyed,

725
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,610
especially by women
with a price on their heads.

726
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,613
Don't try to scare me,
Count Dracula.

727
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:45,292
<i>Hem. The Secrets m' Lite
and Death by Dr. Frankenstein.</i>

728
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:52,303
Memorize them. Operate yourself,
if you're in such a hurry.

729
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:56,508
I have other ways
of securing your cooperation.

730
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,719
You're wasting your time. My
will is as strong as yours.

731
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,930
Are you sure?

732
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,105
Look into my eyes.

733
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,567
Look!

734
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,707
Deepen

735
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,457
Tell me what you see.

736
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,068
Joan, Chick and I are gonna go into the
lockers and change into our costumes.

737
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,357
Come on, Professor. We'll
meet you on the dance floor.

738
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,155
<i>Okay.</i>

739
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,794
What did I do?
What do you mean?

740
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,741
He's dancing with my girl!
So what?

741
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,073
I'll show her!

742
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,328
I'm in love...

743
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,743
Okay. Come on. Pick
up those bundles!

744
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,043
Let's get dressed.
Come on.

745
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,003
So, it's you!
Ah, he knows me!

746
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,627
McDougal! Listen, fat boy,
where are my exhibits?

747
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,711
Now, you leave him alone!

748
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,671
Not until he tells me
where those exhibits are.

749
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,599
Where are they?
Where are they?

750
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,760
McDougal, now
we've got it on you.

751
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,655
You put us in jail. Now, we'll have
you arrested for assault and battery.

752
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,824
Go ahead and see what good it'll do ya.
You haven't got a witness.

753
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,226
I'm a witness! My word's
as good as yours!

754
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,562
Your word is better than his.
You keep outta this.

755
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,864
I'll get a witness. Do me
a favor, will you, fella?

756
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,691
Will you watch this?
I need a witness.

757
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,904
Go ahead. I'd like to
see you do it again.

758
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,451
Did you see it?

759
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:46,200
I'm sorry.
I couldn't see a thing.

760
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,209
Thank you.

761
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,549
Have you seen Chick
Young or Wilbur Grey?

762
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,003
Seen them? I don't
even know them.

763
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,722
I've got to know what
they found on that island.

764
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,134
Chick! Wilbur!
What did you find?

765
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,764
Was I right?
No.

766
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,642
And I wish you'd stop trying to put
those ideas in this boy's head.

767
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,315
He's not used to them. Go
put your things on, Wilbur.

768
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,392
Did you meet Dr. Lejos?
Yes.

769
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:16,652
What did he look like? Tall,
aristocratic, a faraway look in his eye?

770
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,983
All I know is he told us to
go out and have some fun.

771
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,283
Why don't you?

772
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,784
Can't I convince you that Dracula
is a very dangerous person?

773
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:28,743
You and Wilbur are just trying to scare me.
Well, it won't work!

774
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,251
I scared ya.

775
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,707
I scared ya, you big sissy.

776
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,167
This is your mask over there.
Mine?

777
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,714
Oh, no, no. Please don't wear that.
What's the matter?

778
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,015
I know you'll think
I'm crazy, but...

779
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:47,641
In a half an hour the moon will
rise and I'll turn into a wolf.

780
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,438
You and 20 million other guys.
Listen!

781
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,854
I might tear you limb from limb!

782
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,061
Is that serious?
He'll murder ya!

783
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,770
That's serious.

784
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,071
It won't be if you'll just take
me and lock me in my room.

785
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,868
Please.
Oh, all right.

786
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,413
Why don't you hire
yourself a keeper?

787
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,616
Come on.

788
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,128
Hey!

789
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,461
Look.
Oh, Sandra's coming.

790
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,391
Is it all clear? I will
take care of the girl.

791
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,140
And you'll take Wilbur
back to the castle.

792
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,018
Understand?
Yes, Master.

793
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,312
Sandra, you look...

794
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,569
So... We meet again,
Count Dracula.

795
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,367
Dracula? Yes. That's
who he says you are.

796
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:49,206
Oh, my costume perhaps. No, Talbot
here thinks you're the real thing.

797
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,409
Uh-huh. Right out of
McDougal's House of Horrors.

798
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,085
What an odd hallucination.

799
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:58,337
But the human mind is often
inflamed with strange complexes.

800
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,803
I suggest you consult
your physician, Mr. Talbot.

801
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,676
And take him along
with you, please.

802
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,766
Well, so there you are!

803
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,223
I'm glad to see
you've recovered.

804
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,689
I didn't expect to see you here, Doctor.
Sandra insisted I come.

805
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,438
Besides, I need
a little relaxation.

806
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,019
Miss Raymond, would you
honor me with a dance?

807
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,439
No. No!

808
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,819
I warn you.
He is Count Dracula!

809
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,776
How interesting.
Tell me more.

810
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,954
No, let me tell you...
While we dance.

811
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,702
Pardon me, Mr. Talbot.

812
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,706
Sandra, do you feel all right'?
Of course.

813
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,130
But I must obey
my doctor's orders.

814
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:42,005
Oh, sure! You gotta do
what the doctor tells ya.

815
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:46,388
I intend to. Let's
have a walk, Wilbur.

816
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,181
Toodle-oo.

817
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,559
Professor, do you
understand women?

818
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,730
I don't even m'.
I'm gonna get me a drink.

819
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,576
Sit here.

820
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,335
Sandra, there's something strange about ya.
You're not yourself.

821
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,587
Is there anything
I can do to help'?

822
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,007
I want you to go away
with me to the island.

823
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,676
Just me and you'?
Yes.

824
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:33,431
I want to be the only one in your life.
I want to be part of you.

825
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,604
I want to be in your blood.

826
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,105
I think I know what you mean.

827
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:49,493
Wouldn't you want a prettier fellow
than me? No. I want no one but you.

828
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:53,573
You are so full-blooded,
so round, so firm.

829
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,789
So fully packed.
And I want to stay that way.

830
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,043
Stuck myself.
I'm bleedin'.

831
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,796
Let me see it.
Uh-uh.

832
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:09,005
There ain't enough there for the two
of us, if that's what you're thinking.

833
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,931
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
Look into my eyes.

834
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,974
I'm afraid to. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

835
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,018
Look. Deeper.

836
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,266
Deeper!

837
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,144
Deepen

838
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,087
I looked deep enough.
I don't wanna look anymore.

839
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,335
Of course you do.

840
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,709
Don't you know
what's going to happen now?

841
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,838
I'll bite.
Oh, no... I will!

842
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,557
Wilbur!
Joan! Wilbur!

843
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,343
Joan?
There he is.

844
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,975
Wilbur, have you seen Joan?

845
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,102
No, bull have definitely
made up my mind.

846
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,493
You can have Sandra, but make sure
you've got plenty of bandages.

847
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,111
Maybe Dracula lured Joan
into the woods and...

848
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,110
Chick, do "you know what could happen
if I meet Dracula in the woods?

849
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,942
I'll bite. Oh, no. You
gotta stand in line.

850
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,323
Let's not waste anytime.
Yeah, let's.

851
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,620
Joan? Joan?

852
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,291
Joan! Chick,
we can't find her.

853
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,920
Now, let's keep on looking.
Come on. Joan!

854
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,388
Joan?

855
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,309
Chick, we're never
gonna find her.

856
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,557
Joan!

857
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,905
WILBUR; Joan?

858
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,946
Joan?

859
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,873
Joan?

860
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,170
Joan!

861
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,763
Joan!

862
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,521
Chick? Chick?

863
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,527
Where did he go? Chick!

864
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:32,607
I'm gettin' tired of
lookin' for Joan.

865
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,952
Look at him.

866
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,239
Didn't Mr. Talbot tell you not
to put that mask on anymore?

867
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,450
Now, what'd you put it on for?

868
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,290
Now, take the mask off!
Come on!

869
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,224
Joan?

870
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,489
Hey, Chick, now, what are
you lookin' in there for?

871
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,033
You know you're not
gonna find Joan there.

872
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:11,403
Now, come on, get up!
Get up! We gotta find Joan.

873
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,399
Come on, Chick.
Now, take that mask off!

874
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,868
Take it easy.
I'm your friend!

875
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,668
Help! Help!

876
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,836
Help!

877
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,642
The man's been hurt. Looks
like something attacked him.

878
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,594
Get a doctor.

879
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,909
You'll be all right, though another
half inch would have severed

880
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,230
your jugular vein.

881
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,645
Get him up.

882
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,111
Who did it? It was
somebody in a wolf's mask.

883
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,693
McDougal, what happened to you?

884
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,245
You! It was you! He said
he was gonna get me.

885
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,620
Me?
That's right.

886
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,469
I saw him arguing with you
earlier this evening.

887
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,542
That's ridiculous.
Why, I wouldn't...

888
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:15,000
People, real live people.
That's a boy. Tell 'em.

889
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,185
You, Chick.
What's the matter?

890
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,020
What's the idea of trying
to take a bite out of me?

891
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,216
What was the idea?
Now, you.

892
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,523
What, did he take
a bite out of you too?

893
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,607
What's the matter
with you, Chick?

894
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,942
You gone mad or something?
Wilbur!

895
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,026
Don't let that little
fellow fool you.

896
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,597
He's an accomplice.
Me?

897
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,154
Let's call the sheriff.
I'll go call him.

898
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,225
Wait a minute...

899
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,399
Chick! Chick! Oh, Chick!

900
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,606
Chick!
Count Dracula wants me...

901
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,107
Joan, Joan, come on.
We gotta get outta here.

902
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,863
Joan?

903
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,366
Joan? Don't tell me
you've gone bats too.

904
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,870
Wilbur! Wilbur! Wilbur!

905
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,597
Chick! Chick!

906
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,100
Chick, Chick.
Quiet. They're after me.

907
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,810
After you? What for?

908
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,316
McDougal was almost killed
last night by either a wolf

909
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:43,694
or a man wearing
a mask of a wolf!

910
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,485
It was a wolf.

911
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:50,072
I'm going to give myself up.
It's the only way to clear you.

912
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:53,913
Then, you were on the level
about that wolf business?

913
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:57,792
Yes. I'm going to surrender. Wait a minute.
You can't do that!

914
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,000
Dracula's taken Wilbur
and Joan to the island.

915
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,677
Are you sure of that? I saw
what I saw when I saw it!

916
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,223
Hurry! Follow me!

917
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,747
They may come back.
But Dracula?

918
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,167
Dracula is helpless until after nightfall.
Maybe by then we'll...

919
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:40,372
Okay. But after what I saw
there'd better not be any maybe.

920
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:45,506
Sandra. Sandra?

921
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,171
Sandra!

922
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,933
Junior?

923
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,594
Junior?

924
01:06:58,765 --> 01:06:59,982
Junior.

925
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,106
Will you help me get outta here?

926
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:09,735
Sandra! Junior.

927
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:12,866
Sandra! Junior.

928
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:40,057
Shall we begin?
I've been waiting, Master.

929
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,351
Sandra? Sandra?

930
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,490
He's growing weaker!

931
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,291
Will he respond
to the operation?

932
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,243
If the generators
are kept going.

933
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,078
Then, we must start immediately.

934
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:05,711
I'll get rid of Stevens,
and you take care of him.

935
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,720
Sandra, what are you gonna do?

936
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:14,637
Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you.
Thank you.

937
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:17,185
Soon, instead of being
short and chubby,

938
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:22,266
you'll be big and tall
and <i>as</i> strong as an ox.

939
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:28,605
And furthermore, you'll live
forever and never grow old.

940
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,816
Oh, Sandra.

941
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,071
You still love me.

942
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,746
But, Sandra, how are
you gonna do all these things?

943
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,915
By a simple operation.

944
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:44,163
I shall remove your brain
and put it in his body.

945
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:47,006
You're gonna take my brain
and put it in Junior's body?

946
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,754
Yes.

947
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,372
For a minute, I didn't know
how you were gonna do it?

948
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,774
Good evening, Professor.

949
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:09,734
Is everything under control?
Everything but my temper.

950
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,486
I found Miss Raymond
in Dr. Mornay's room.

951
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:16,160
You should mind your own
business, Professor.

952
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:19,535
I also found this, which
is very much my business.

953
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:22,743
And after I've taken Joan back
to town, I'm gonna help...

954
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,706
Excellent

955
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:29,132
Let's take him to the cellar.

956
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,881
We can dispose of all the
bodies at the same time.

957
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,811
Well, there's the boat all right.
Let's look around.

958
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,697
That must be the
entrance to the castle.

959
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,149
Come on.

960
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,741
Come.

961
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,324
Lie down. Here.

962
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,328
Yes, Master.

963
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,126
Frankie, don't let
'em do it to ya.

964
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,674
Frankie boy.
Listen to me, Frankie.

965
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,382
Don't let 'em do it to ya!

966
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,220
Frankie. Frankie! I'm tellin'
ya, it's a bad deal.

967
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:05,270
I've had this brain for 30 years
and it hasn't worked right yet.

968
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,139
Ask me how much one and one is, Frankie.
Go ahead, ask me.

969
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,769
I don't know.

970
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,068
We'll be right back, Wilbur.

971
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,192
Okay. I'll wait.

972
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,545
Chick!
Wilbur!

973
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,881
Dracula is Dracula!

974
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:44,026
And Sandra's gonna use my brain to make
a bigger dummy out of the other dummy.

975
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,360
Wait, I'll get you out of this.
No kiddin'!

976
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,557
Wait a minute.
Hurry up.

977
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,940
All right. Attaboy.

978
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,731
Does it hurt? No, no. Go
ahead, a little harder.

979
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,729
Something wrong here...

980
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,866
What's the matter? All right,
I'm doing the best I can!

981
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,406
Wait a minute. Oh,
pardon me, I'm sorry.

982
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:12,837
There you are. Now, get outta here.
Go ahead.

983
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:16,750
Hey, not that way.
To the left!

984
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,807
Get him out.
Get him out! Attaboy.

985
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:27,514
No door. No door? Come
on, get outta here!

986
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,970
Come on.
Hey.

987
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,854
Now, take it easy,
you'll be all right.

988
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,690
We gotta get back to the castle.
Joan's in there. Come on.

989
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,526
Come on, Wilbur. Not me. Not me,
I'm not goin' back in there.

990
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,703
I've got too much
of what they want, brains.

991
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,297
All right. Get the motor
started in the boat.

992
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,322
Hurry up.
Okay.

993
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,716
They've escaped!

994
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:02,671
You attend to the Monster. I can
handle our fat friend. Come.

995
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,062
Wilbur.

996
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,643
Come back.

997
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,325
Come.

998
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,330
I said, come back!

999
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:43,507
Come!

1000
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:11,242
Wilbur! We're all set, Wilbur.
You got the boat...

1001
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:13,616
Wilbur! We're all set, Wilbur.
You got the boat...

1002
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,167
Wilbur!

1003
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,459
He's not here!

1004
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,958
Now where's! he go?

1005
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,836
Look!

1006
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:25,712
They started the operation.

1007
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,515
They must've found him.
We've gotta go back.

1008
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,765
You stay here with Joan.

1009
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,549
Please, give me a little ether.

1010
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:06,468
We don't need it.
You won't feel a thing.

1011
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,787
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you!

1012
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,874
Get me off here.

1013
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,962
What are you lookin' out the window for?
Somebody else comin' after me?

1014
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,698
Hey! Will you...

1015
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,666
Chick, help! Please!

1016
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,165
Chick!

1017
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:50,690
Chick! Chick! Oh, Chick!

1018
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,867
Chick!

1019
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,995
Chick!

1020
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,418
Back.

1021
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,754
Back!

1022
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,043
Chick! Come on!

1023
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,338
Chick, do you believe me now?
YES.

1024
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,177
Hurry up.

1025
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,776
Let's barricade the door.
Okay.

1026
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,456
Come on, get it over
there. Get in there.

1027
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,197
Okay, come on.

1028
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:36,778
There.

1029
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,357
Come on. Put your shoulder to the door.
Hold it tight.

1030
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,829
We barricaded it.
He can't get in here!

1031
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,215
Come on, Wilbur!

1032
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,219
Come on!

1033
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,417
Back.

1034
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,384
Back.

1035
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:40,433
Back.
Yes, Master.

1036
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,134
He thinks I'm Dracula.

1037
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,251
Well, we got him!

1038
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:46,116
Joan! Joan!
Are you all right?

1039
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,239
McDougal.
I gotcha.

1040
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,710
You're just the one we're lookin' for.
You still want your exhibits?

1041
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,614
Of course I do. Well, here
comes one of 'em now!

1042
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,633
Chick!
Come on, Wilbur!

1043
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,515
Fill that bucket with gas.

1044
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,605
Untie the boat.

1045
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:57,811
Untie the boat!

1046
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,286
Untie the boat, will ya?

1047
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,793
Untie the boat, will ya please?

1048
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,791
Okay!

1049
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,745
Well, he won't chase us anymore.
And thing, Mr. Chick Young.

1050
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,182
The next time that I tell you that
I saw something when I saw it,

1051
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,880
you'll believe me that I saw it!

1052
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:02,959
Oh, relax.

1053
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:06,130
Now that we've seen the last of
Dracula, the Wolfman and the Monster,

1054
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:08,136
there's nobody to
frighten us anymore.

1055
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,101
<i>That's too bad. I was
hoping to get in on the excitement.</i>

1056
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,725
<i>Who said</i> that?
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

1057
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,353
<i>I'm the Invisible Man.</i>
