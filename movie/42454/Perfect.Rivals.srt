00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,723
Hello, Zhen Zhen.

2
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,933
That's right, your eyes look better
if you draw them bigger.

3
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,501
Jenny, the lipstick color
looks really unique.

4
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,203
It's a pity that your lips are too thick.

5
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,705
Your foundation is too pale,

6
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,507
your eyebrows are too thick.

7
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,909
You just look like...

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,915
A clown who doesn't know how to
crack jokes cry in the circus.

9
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,920
It's too heart-wrenching to watch.

10
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,722
Jenny.

11
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,924
Your thighs didn't used to be so huge

12
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,226
They make skin that you are wearing now

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,728
look like...

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,731
like a very narrow womb,

15
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,702
fervently supporting a pair
of premature obese twins,

16
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,705
who can't get out no
matter how hard they try.

17
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,008
It's such a sad plight to watch.

18
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,109
Zhen Zhen Zhen!

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,710
I've tolerated you for too long!

20
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,212
You've been taunting me since day one!

21
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,914
I've had enough!

22
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,419
Stab me if you dare.

23
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,801
Jenny.

24
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,506
Remember what you told me
on your first day of work?

25
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,608
You want your dad to retire next year.

26
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,910
Let your sister have her surgery.

27
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,313
Send your brother to study in England.

28
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,115
You want the whole world to know,

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,616
without certificates of
university education,

30
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,618
you also can be successful just like me.

31
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,020
Remember?

32
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,023
You're conscientious and
that's your strength.

33
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:09,428
You'll notice details
that many of us neglect.

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,731
So you have to utilize this strength.

35
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,506
Understand?

36
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,003
I'm sure you haven'! had lunch.

37
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,705
Go grab a bite.

38
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,108
If not, your gastritis will acts up again.

39
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,610
I'm not hungry.

40
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,812
I'll get back to work right now.

41
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,020
Go ahead.

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,624
I want you to fire Jenny at the
end of this month. Understand?

43
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,725
Me?

44
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,326
Rule no.2?

45
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,228
Must not argue with mommy.

46
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,830
Rule no.5?

47
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,799
Love each other, for peace and harmony.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,003
No. 4?

49
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,304
Wider.

50
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,406
Wider.

51
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,320
Good girl.

52
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,900
Ladies! I love you!

53

"Chen Xiao Hu, second son of Chen family"

54
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,008
How are you today?

55
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,810
Thank you...

56
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,612
Korean's famous drama serial

57
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,914
I know "Jewel In The Palace".

"Famous Korean star, Bay Yong Joon"
On a cold winter's night,

61
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,106
"Famous Korean star, Bay Yong Joon"
I think of you.

62
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,304
Welcome...

63
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,406
Try our specialty jerked meat.

64
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,614
It's definitely better
than our competitor's.

65
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:16,511
A jerked meat in winter,
your ultimate pleasure.

66
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,928
Mei Mei jerked meat, I love Mei Mei.

Come on.

Ready.

Nice to meet you...

78
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,405
Hey...

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,122
Hey ladies...

Thank you very much!

81
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,531
Hi boss!

82
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,600
Give me half a kilogram
of chicken jerked meat.

83
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,103
No problem! This way...

84
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,705
Do you see this?

85
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,609
I don't care what despicable means
you use to steal my customers.

86
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,110
You will never be able to steal

87
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,415
My most faithful customer.

88
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,317
Because I have the secret family recipe.

89
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,820
Word has it that "Mei Mei Bak
Kwa" maybe most successful.

90
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,523
But our "Hao Han Bak Kwa" tastes the best!

91
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,525
Am I right?

92
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:12,442
Hey... old man!
You can'! die!

93
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,404
Send him to the hospital...

94
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:23,008
You are my only old customer. Don't die.

95
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,209
Okay...

96
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,112
You'd better go take care
of your only old customer

97
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,720
while I have to go serve
my many new customers.

98
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,718
We'll chat another day.

99
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,320
Stupid woman! Don't you gloat!

100
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,922
I will show you someday about

101
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,523
what is "when the tree
falls, the monkeys tum!"

102
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,624
Boss Chen.

103
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,326
Actually its when the tree
falls, the monkeys scatter.

104
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,627
Not tum!

105
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,630
I prefer it this way, monkeys tum...

106
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,099
Anyway...
So what?

107
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,203
If the tree falls, you'll be
the first monkey to scatter.

108
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,205
Bye.

109
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,121
Morning, master...

110
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,224
Listen up everyone!

111
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:17,028
This woman is mine and
no one can touch her!

112
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:22,701
Whoever touches her, I will kill him!

113
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,102
Call madam!

114
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,207
Morning, madam...

115
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,311
Get back to work.

116
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,314
Master.

117
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,216
Madam.

118
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:44,022
I maybe blind, but in my heart,

119
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,025
Hao is my favourite disciple.

120
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,529
He has great potential.

121
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,598
Stop fooling around.

122
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,100
Master.

123
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,808
I'll get back to my work.

124
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,330
<i>Quick...</i>

125
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,901
There?

126
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,303
Superman?

127
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,304
Superman's here!

128
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,909
How dare you steal?

129
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,212
Did you make him steal?

130
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,114
<i>Yes...
So it was you!</i>

131
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,115
Stealing is wrong!

132
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,917
It's wrong...

133
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,720
All right...
It's wrong...

134
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,921
Have you had enough?

135
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,223
I'll beat you to death!
Beat me to death?

136
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,025
A son who beats his dad will
be struck by lightning!

137
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,527
You're hitting him again?
I'm going to kill you!

138
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,028
Be careful of retribution.

139
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,730
Is this not retribution?

140
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,298
Give birth to both of you.

141
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,000
One always acts like superman

142
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,401
and one who drinks all day long.

143
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,502
What's wrong with my drinking?

144
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,304
I know I caused mom's death.

145
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,506
Everything I do is wrong in your eyes.

146
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,408
I didn't say you caused your mom's death.

147
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,611
I merely said your mom died
after giving birth to you.

148
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,512
All right, stop quarreling.

149
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,214
None of us caused anyone's death.

150
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,115
Shall we continue to play?

151
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,717
I'm not in the mood!

152
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,118
You two are making me angry!

153
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,419
And if I really die,

154
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,333
this family will be like
"tree fall, monkey scatter".

155
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,429
The theme for this year's
"Bak Kwa King" competition is innovation.

156
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,199
If your jerked meat is the
tastiest and the most novel.

157
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,901
You get to open a store

158
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,706
at our newly opened Evergreen IR!

159
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,209
Here comes "Hao Han Bak Kwa",

160
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,215
everyone else will perish!

161
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,816
I'm here to take part in the competition.

162
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,718
I'm sorry, Boss Chen.

163
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,221
The last day for
registration was yesterday.

164
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,422
I'm so sorry.

165
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,524
I don't understand what's last day.

166
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,426
I don't know what do you say!

167
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,629
Word has it that "Mei Mei Bak
Kwa" maybe most successful.

168
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,098
But "Hao Han Bak Kwa" tastes the best!

169
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,001
If "Hao Han Bak Kwa" is not competing,

170
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,103
what sort of a competition would this be?

171
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,105
Am I right?

172
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:18,710
Mr. President, why don'!
you give Boss Chen a chance?

173
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,311
I too hope "Hao Han Bak Kwa"

174
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,519
Gets a chance to participate
in the competition.

175
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,419
Just look at... this woman.

176
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,833
How does she lie through her teeth?

177
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,627
Use your mouth when you talk.

178
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,228
Not your hand.

179
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,329
What are you?

180
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,298
I am "Mei Mei Bak Kwa's"...

181
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:45,003
mascot

182
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,606
Mei Mei...

183
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,508
Tastes the best!

184
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,112
Yummy...

185
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,117
You'll love it!

186
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm also Mei Mei's friend, lover,

187
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,221
personal assistant, chauffeur,

188
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,824
domestic helper, hair stylist, masseur

189
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,525
and animal trainer.

190
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:12,530
And killer...

191
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,599
Mickey.
Yes, madam.

192
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,910
This creature is quite strong.

193
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,711
All right...

194
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:30,115
I accused you of lying
in front of everybody.

195
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,316
That was my bad.

196
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:36,321
I now offer you a toast
as a sign of my apology.

197
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,622
Come on.

198
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,825
Why offer me a toast when
you know I can't drink?

199
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:45,130
I'm toasting you precisely
because I know you can'! drink.

200
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,531
Miss Mei Mei.

201
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:50,001
I'm offering you a toast in
front of all these people.

202
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,302
You won't oblige.

203
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,204
You can'! be that petty.

204
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,907
If Boss Chen offers me a toast

205
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,408
how can I not oblige?

206
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,810
Right?

207
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,011
Let's drink.

208
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,821
Cheers!

209
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,426
Okay.

210
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:20,427
It shines the Xindian River like the past.

211
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,302
Winter just like the past.

212
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,505
Icy rainwater just like the past.

213
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,707
I love you.

214
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:38,212
The dust has collected by
wind just like the past.

215
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,420
Smiles just like the past.

216
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,223
Tears just like the past.

217
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,925
Like the past.

218
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:53,241
You and I still same like the past.

219
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,203
Our jerked meat are partially
cooked in the factory,

220
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,905
then fully grilled in our shops.

221
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,809
This ensures absolute
freshness and crispiness.

222
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,511
Come... please try our
specialty jerked meat

223
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,914
Please try the specialty jerked meat
from "Mei Mei Bak Kwa".

224
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,116
Okay...

225
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,821
Let's dig in...

226
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,923
Delicious...

227
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,326
The best jerked meat!

228
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,428
Pain.

229
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,100
It really hurts!
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

230
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,701
Hey, are you okay?

231
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,103
You charcoal-faced Japanese.

232
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,705
Can you go somewhere else and die?

233
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,509
It's been a long time, sister.

234
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,510
Yuan?

235
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,511
You jerk!

236
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,213
I'm going to strangle you...

237
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,015
I hate you.

238
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,016
I love you!

239
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,429
"Zhen Yuan Yuan,
young foster daughter of Zhen family"

240
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,626
Sister! I don't want too
much oil in my salad!

241
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,930
This is not fattening!

242
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,410
Don'! move.

243
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,102
It's dirty, you haven'! washed your hands.

244
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,504
Don'! want.

245
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,506
Yuan, didn't mom send you to America?

246
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,408
Why did you return as a Japanese?

247
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,610
Sis, they're all my good friends.

248
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,711
They're Japanese.

249
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,813
So I became one as well.

250
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,214
You haven't changed.

251
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,517
As insecure as always.

252
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,619
Since young, you're always
trying to be someone else

253
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,120
to try to fit in.

254
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,929
Look at you now.
You've no character at all.

255
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,529
The good thing is,

256
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,431
you're still my little Miss Yuan Yuan.

257
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,099
So cute.

258
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,102
You're so cute.

259
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,704
Mom, you too.

260
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,706
You're my little miss angel.

261
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,308
All right... you smooth talker.

262
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,310
I was taken in by your
sweet words in the past,

263
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,411
that's why I decided to adopt you.

264
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,213
I am not lying, I am telling the truth.

265
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:26,517
You are really my little miss angel.

266
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,921
Now that you've graduated, can
you come back and help me?

267
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,232
Sure, what would you like me to do?

268
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,230
Be my spy.

269
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,199
Be a spy?

270
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Breathe in.

271
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,303
All right, don't move...

272
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,304
Focus!

273
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,905
All right, stand straight. Let me see.

274
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:48,906
Is that okay?

275
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,108
All right, it's ﬂat enough. Good.

276
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,109
Cling wrap.

277
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,510
Don'! move.

278
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,212
Let me cut this.

279
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,114
Your mission is to find out

280
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,415
what new product they
will be coming up with

281
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,617
for the "Bak Kwa King" competition.

282
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,019
New product?

283
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,022
Regardless of the new product they present,

284
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,723
we will also present the same, but...

285
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,226
only better!

286
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,228
But they are pathetic as it is,

287
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,629
must we still kill them off?

288
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,798
No, we're not killing them off.

289
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,199
We're just getting rid of them.

290
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,301
So that we don't have to see them everyday.

291
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,302
On?

292
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,303
On...

293
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,505
Banana?

294
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,506
It seems a bit short.

295
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,008
Here, your hand.

296
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,610
Sister, it's ticklish!
Don't play around.

297
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,012
Sister, should we go for something harder?

298
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,114
Let me tell you, 8 out of 10 men are soft.

299
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,417
Putting a hard one won'! be realistic.

300
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,519
Is it better this way or that?

301
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,521
All right...

302
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,826
Yuan... you really look the part!

303
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,830
My 'son' is so handsome!

304
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,999
From now on, you're a man.

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But you must remember.

306
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,001
Rule no. 1.

307
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,304
Men can't be trusted...

308
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,410
"Hao Han Bak Kwa"

309
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,218
Hurry up...

310
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,622
Hey...

311
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,623
Must you fan so hard?

312
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,624
Am I not perspiring enough?

313
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,926
Are you trying to kill me in this heat?

314
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,327
I'm Superman

315
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,029
And Superman is strong.

316
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,030
Superman...

317
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,898
Do you really think you are superman?

318
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,600
You must be crazy.

319
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,901
I'm not crazy.

320
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,604
I'm very smart and I used
to be number one in class.

321
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,407
<i>Yes... you still are number one.</i>

322
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,321
Number one in insanity!

323
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:37,217
Hey... come back!

324
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,322
Hey...

325
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,123
Who are you?

326
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,324
I'm called Teh Si.

327
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,626
I don't care if you're Teh Si or Coffee Si.

328
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,732
Why are you in my kitchen?

329
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,999
Boss Chen.

330
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,202
I've just been fired by "Mei Mei Bak Kwa".

331
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,404
When I asked Mei Mei why she fired me,

332
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,716
she actually said it was because I'm a man.

333
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,612
That wretch still hates men huh?

334
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,014
That wretch still hates men huh?

335
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,215
I was furious.

336
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,719
So before I left, I said
something that left her fuming.

337
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I said...

338
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,221
"Mei Mei Bak Kwa" maybe
the most successful,

339
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:22,126
but "Hao Han Bak Kwa" tastes the best...

340
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,228
Clever.

341
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,430
Hey Teh Si,

342
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:32,404
you seriously think
"Hao Han Bak Kwa" tastes the best?

343
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,613
Are you crying?

344
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,614
Boss.

345
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,316
Could you let me work here?

346
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,322
I'll work hard, boss.

347
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,624
This jade pendant...

348
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,127
Why are you wearing this jade pendant?

349
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,631
I've been wearing it since young.

350
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,904
Tum over.

351
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,306
Why?

352
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,117
Tum over and I'll tell you.

353
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,025
This is from my mom.

354
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,127
I want you to have it.

355
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,529
When we have a baby,

356
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,806
I'll let our child wear this.

357
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,019
All right, <i>I'll</i> hire you.

358
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
You can start work immediately.

359
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,122
Really? Thank you boss!

360
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:02,026
But boss, I'm homeless right now.

361
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,029
Can <i>I...</i>
Yes, you can stay at my place.

362
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,498
Really? Boss, you're such a nice man.

363
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,500
Thank you, boss...

364
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,801
I promise I'll work hard.

365
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,603
Thanks boss, I will work really hard!

366
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,413
Here you go.

367
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,109
You don'! even want to eat
your own jerked meat.

368
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,911
How can you expect customers to eat it?

369
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,714
You're Superman, you have it

370
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,717
You're our guest, you have it first.

371
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,620
You guys do not appreciate what you have.

372
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,622
Where in the world can you find a father

373
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,924
who'd make jerked meat
for his sons everyday?

374
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,127
You grew up eating my jerked meat.

375
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,730
You ought to be able
to feel my mood from eating my jerked meat.

376
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,500
Whether I'm in a good mood or bad mood.

377
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,801
And also if I haven't defecate.

378
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,703
Do you guys understand?

379
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,806
Can we not talk about
defecate during dinner?

380
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,207
I asked you to have jerked meat

381
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,109
and you gave me a crappy face.

382
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,412
So why can't I talk about excrement?

383
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,614
All right.

384
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,617
Eat excrement...

385
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,019
Dad, eat excrement.
What do you mean?

386
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,021
How dare you said that
jerked meat which feed us

387
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,433
is excrement?

388
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,906
Brother Xiao Ma, sorry to trouble you.

389
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,909
I'm afraid of ghosts, so I can'!
sleep alone outside.

390
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,911
Can you sleep outside instead?

391
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,112
Sure, don'! worry.

392
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,113
I'm Superman

393
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,116
I'm not afraid of anything,
I can sleep anywhere.

394
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,519
Brother Xiao Ma, not only you
are as brave as Superman.

395
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,821
You're more benevolent than Batman,

396
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,922
kinder than Spiderman

397
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,130
and greater than Iron man.

398
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,499
Goodnight...

399
00:22:55,607 --> 00:23:00,611
Brother Xiao Hu, it's bedtime
and you're still drinking?

400
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,515
Why do you like to drink so much?

401
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,521
I need to drink to stay sober.

402
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:17,224
And I need to stay sober to drink.

403
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,702
So, are you drunk or sober now?

404
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:32,109
Drunk when sober and sober when drunk.

405
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,115
Drunk and feel sleepiness.

406
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,510
Feel sleepiness but sober.

407
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,204
Sorry, I didn't know someone was here.

408
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,607
Don'! worry, we're all men.

409
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,316
Please continue...

410
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,314
Is he sleeping there again?

411
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,615
Let me wake him up.

412
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,817
Don'! move!

413
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:57,823
Let me do it.

414
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,007
Pervert! Why did you touch me?

415
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,111
I bought this online.

416
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,114
It was specially flown in from Japan.

417
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,517
It's been worn by a girl before.

418
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,618
And...

419
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,920
this is what I stole from
the swimming pool that day.

420
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,622
It's still warm.

421
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,223
Still warm?

422
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,625
These things are not meant for children.

423
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,826
Go out... leave this room.

424
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,933
But I want to see!
Cannot... get out!

425
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,205
Are you pervert?

426
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,109
I'm already 20 something
but I'm not yet a man.

427
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,711
Not a man?

428
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,512
I worked at "Mei Mei Bak Kwa",

429
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,015
but none of the girls fancied me.

430
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,622
I'm a man too and I have my needs.

431
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,422
Don'! worry.

432
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,825
If there's anything that I,
Chen Xiao Hu has plenty of,

433
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,127
it's women.

434
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,929
I assure you.

435
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,330
Within a month...

436
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,799
I will make you into a man.

437
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,602
On?

438
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,205
On!

439
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,307
Okay! Drink up!

440
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,015
Cheers.

441
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,119
Thank you.

442
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,437
Pepper?

443
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,214
Excuse me.

444
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,025
So"?...

445
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:13,424
Xiao Ma.

446
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,825
Superman!

447
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,527
You'll have to do me a favour.

448
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,630
Listen, you are not my
primary school classmate.

449
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,598
Hey! Are you listening to me?

450
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,100
You are not my primary school classmate.

451
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,503
You are my boyfriend.

452
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,505
Whatever it is, no matter
what happens later,

453
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,506
don’t speak, just nod your head.

454
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,809
Don't speak, just nod your head.

455
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,112
May I speak with the boss?

456
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,414
Do you know how to do business?

457
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,017
With my qualities, I have
no problem finding a man.

458
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,020
I engaged your services only
because I wanted to save time.

459
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,421
But you are so unprofessional.

460
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,023
Give me a fake foreign
person who's short, ugly,

461
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:51,028
Skinny, strange and can't even
speak a word of Mandarin!

462
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,330
Zhen Zhen.

463
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,399
Brother Bin Bin.

464
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
Shall we dance?

465
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:01,006
But brother Bin Bin,
this is a restaurant, not a dance hall.

466
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:23,123
If you and I get together,

467
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,029
you won'! have to...

468
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,001
Are you pervert?

469
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:39,109
Brother Bin Bin, your
hair is also your hat.

470
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,612
Not only that...

471
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,315
you're also a magician.

472
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,719
Who can make yourself tall.

473
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,025
Do you know what I felt
when I kicked him just now?

474
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,501
Fake hair, fake shoes, fake sexual organ!

475
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,103
Everything about you is fake.

476
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,109
Why don'! you change your name to Mr. Fake?

477
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,621
Bye.

478
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,820
Apple!

479
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Who is he?

480
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,523
Him... he is my new boyfriend.

481
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,226
I want to break up with you.

482
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,527
It's mine.
Don'! take my toy.

483
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,429
It's mine!
Let go...

484
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,698
Why did you snatch my son's toy?

485
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,300
This toy belongs to me.

486
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,301
It's mine!

487
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,303
My son says the toy belongs to him.
So it's belongs to him.

488
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,305
Don'! bully my son.

489
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,607
I'm Superman, I will not
bully little children

490
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,709
Who in the world would
call himself Superman?

491
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,810
Are you crazy?

492
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,912
I'm not crazy, I'm Superman.

493
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:53,116
You are obviously crazy...

494
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,117
Hey!

495
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,920
Have you had enough?

496
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,722
Excuse me, you old lady.

497
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,325
Isn't botox free of charge these days?

498
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,626
How can you call yourself a mother?

499
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,927
With a mom like you,

500
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,530
your son's bound to
become a gangster at 10,

501
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,497
a thief by 20,

502
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,299
a robber by 30,

503
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,001
a terrorist by 40.

504
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,703
At 50, he'll rob his own mother.

505
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,304
At 60, he'll dig up your grave

506
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,616
and sell your bones to the junk dealer!

507
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,411
Don'! think I forgot about you.

508
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,114
Get up...

509
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,116
His here is stronger than you,

510
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,718
here is bigger than you,

511
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,119
here is better looking than you,

512
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,520
and here has 6 more pecks than you.

513
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,822
Tum over.

514
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,224
And here also, has more power than you.

515
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,426
Any woman would have
chosen him and not you.

516
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,527
Am I right?

517
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:38,734
Right...

518
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,600
Gilbert... wait!

519
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,808
Let's go.

520
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:52,309
Yes!

521
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,310
Are you okay?

522
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,812
My ankle hurts.

523
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,515
I'll send you to the hospital.

524
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,117
Can you drive?

525
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:04,021
I can't drive but I can fly.

526
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,729
Fly?

527
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,327
Who told you you're Superman?

528
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,429
My brother Xiao Hu told me so.

529
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,998
After being hit by my dad when I was 10,

530
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,500
I was admitted to the hospital.

531
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,102
Xiao Hu told me from then on,

532
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,505
I became Superman

533
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,308
When did you learn to ﬂy?

534
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,619
After I became Superman,
I naturally knew how to ﬂy.

535
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,113
Big sister.

536
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,616
Thank you for helping me.

537
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,419
If you meet with any problems
in the future, you can find me.

538
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,623
I'm Superman, I'll surely help you

539
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,924
Why so slow?

540
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,426
Superman, can you ﬂy faster?

541
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,838
Of course.

542
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,810
<i>Hi.</i>

543
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,312
Why have you not visited me
at my shop for so long?

544
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,714
I've been busy...

545
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:08,018
You have to come for a massage
no matter how busy you are.

546
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,821
And I will give you special service.

547
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,724
Make you into like "Hao Han Bak Kwa".

548
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,826
Like...

549
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,728
Hey...

550
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,629
Real man!

551
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,498
All right... why don'! you go in
and have some jerked meat?

552
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,503
I need to sweep the ﬂoor.

553
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,514
Look at you...

554
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,815
You don'! listen again.

555
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,218
Why aren't you using
the magic pillow I bought for you?

556
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,620
Can you lower your volume?
There're people around.

557
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,123
Right, there's people around. So what?

558
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,824
Is it a crime to care for you?

559
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:51,432
Is it a sin to love you?

560
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,000
If you're giving me a
massage, use more force.

561
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,802
More harder. Don'! be a pansy.

562
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,505
Make me happy, make me comfortable.

563
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,409
Give me excitement, make me high.

564
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,611
Monica Cheng.

565
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,714
Come over.

566
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,817
Didn't you say you were going
to offer me a special service?

567
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,419
Massage now.

568
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,023
Here...

569
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,025
Make me comfortable, make me excited,

570
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,627
make me a man!

571
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,733
No problem...

572
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,602
Mickey! Come!

573
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,212
Feels good.

574
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,624
Yes! Right there...

575
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,617
Painful?

576
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,827
No, not at all... it's comfortable...

577
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,125
Mickey!

578
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:59,029
It's comfortable!

579
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,897
You make me so excited!

580
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,311
Harder...

581
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,807
Yes, baby!

582
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,309
Yes!

583
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,710
Oh yeah!

584
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,212
Higher!

585
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,813
Lower!

586
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,020
I can't stand it...

587
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,222
<i>It's hurt!
Yes...</i>

588
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,724
Help!

589
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:28,725
Are you trying to kill my dad?

590
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,229
Let me rescue you, dad!

591
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,501
Trying to kill my dad? Go...

592
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,103
What did you do?
She was only giving me a massage,

593
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,705
not kill me!

594
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,607
You're superman but you can'!
tell right from wrong.

595
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,814
"" 1 going to hit you!

596
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,714
Are you going to hit me again?

597
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,916
Where are you off to?

598
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,600
You still have feelings for him.

599
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,013
Of course not.

600
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,017
It's you.

601
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,818
Why are you here?

602
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,021
Kids shouldn't come here.

603
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,624
I'm not a child, I'm Superman!

604
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,426
Superman good at drinking.

605
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,528
Does Superman want a drink?

606
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,397
Okay.

607
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,098
Give me your largest mug!

608
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,703
Okay.

609
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,805
Why are you drinking milk?

610
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,008
Because I'm not Superman.

611
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,910
Superman, here's your drink.

612
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,912
Cheers!

613
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,722
Cheers!

614
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,821
I'm mad at someone.

615
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,825
I'm also mad at someone.

616
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:13,029
I see this person everyday.

617
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,900
I also see this person everyday.

618
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,302
He hurt me very deeply.

619
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:23,006
He too hurt me very deeply.

620
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,508
I hate him.

621
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,011
I hate him too.

622
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,217
Why are you drinking my milk?
Why are you drinking my beer?

623
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:43,236
We changed the world or
it has been changed us?

624
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,708
Smiles just like the past.

625
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,611
Tears just like the past.

626
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,413
Like the past.

627
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:10,024
You and I still same like the past.

628
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,999
I think I've seen you before.

629
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,202
Are you nuts? My shop is next to yours.

630
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,305
Of course you've seen me before.

631
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:33,412
No, I meant I've seen you asleep.

632
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,116
How dare you...

633
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,124
So your dad hit you after
you drew on my picture?

634
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,926
That's right...

635
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:53,029
My dad has never explained why he hit me.

636
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,099
I only knew that after I was
admitted to the hospital,

637
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,011
the doctor made me become Superman

638
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,908
Do you sing like this only after you drink?

639
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,910
Don'! you feel better

640
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,113
after singing your heart out like this?

641
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,614
Seems like it.

642
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:15,620
I feel much happier after
our singing session.

643
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:23,426
If only dad's jerked meat made us as happy,

644
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,229
Xiao Hu and I wouldn't be as unhappy,

645
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,700
when eating those leftover jerked meat.

646
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:35,004
Beer flavored jerked meat...

647
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,606
That's right! Beer flavored jerked meat!

648
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:40,810
Beer jerked meat that will
make you happy after eating!

649
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:46,816
I'm going to unveil beer jerked
meat for this competition.

650
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,018
Beer jerked meat is a brilliant idea.

651
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,822
It's my idea, don't you tell your dad.

652
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,425
I promise, I won't say a word to my dad.

653
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,426
On?

654
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,128
On.

655
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,129
So"?...

656
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,804
Don'! forget you're Superman.

657
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,812
Are you trying to scare people?

658
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,714
Did you just come from a costume party?

659
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,216
Not telling you, unless
you apologize to me.

660
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,518
You wish.

661
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,921
Ever heard of a father
saying sorry to his son?

662
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,123
Then why are you holding the needle?

663
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,426
Needle?

664
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,428
You talking about this?

665
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,498
I'm doing acupuncture.

666
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,800
Acupuncture?

667
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,503
No one does acupuncture through a shirt.

668
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,704
It's special acupuncture.

669
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,406
You're bleeding.

670
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,508
What's the big deal?

671
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,718
A man sheds blood, not tears.

672
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,815
See this?

673
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:55,127
Does it hurt?
Not at all!

674
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:11,311
You lost! Drink up...

675
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,706
I am not the main lead
today, it's someone else.

676
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,007
Who...

677
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,108
You see him?

678
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,612
That's him! Go, make him drunk!

679
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,415
Sorry, we're not interested in little boys.

680
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,218
What little boy? He's got a name.

681
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,919
He's called Teh Si.

682
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,823
Teh Si? Not my cup of tea...

683
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,727
Come on, just drink...

684
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,629
Quickly drink, quickly.

685
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,701
I'll help him drink.

686
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,904
What have you done?

687
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,205
I'm all wet!

688
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,007
Your makeup's ruined, your blouse's wet.

689
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,709
Do you ladies want to go to the washroom?

690
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,712
I'm sorry I didn't mean it,
this is my first time drinking.

691
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,624
SO"?

692
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,622
I can't drink it anymore...

693
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,825
Let's go home.

694
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,831
Wait, I have something for you.

695
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,300
<i>One.</i>

696
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,502
Not enough...

697
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,005
Two.

698
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,507
Three.

699
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,508
Four.

700
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:29,012
Five. Six.

701
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,713
Take them all!

702
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:36,027
Give your best shot...

703
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,528
Brother Xiao Hu, behave
yourself, we're out now.

704
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,696
Let's go back and do.

705
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,398
No... I mean talk.

706
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:52,404
It'll be bad if someone
sees us, Brother Xiao Hu.

707
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,703
Oh no!

708
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,005
He is actually a...

709
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,907
What a waste...

710
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:03,324
Don'! be like this, Brother Xiao Hu...

711
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,416
Open up!

712
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,918
Who's in there?

713
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,420
Why did you block the door?

714
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,923
Open up! I'm going to throw up!

715
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,707
Pardon me... let me help you clean this up.

716
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,709
Don'! move!

717
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,713
Brother Xiao Hu, I heard that

718
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,316
it's very popular to bathe
like this in Venezuela.

719
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:17,520
Bathing in vomit is great
for the complexion!

720
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,832
I finally get to try it today!

721
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,728
I must really thank you, brother Xiao Hu.

722
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,399
Do you know why I'm always drinking?

723
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
I don't know.

724
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,402
Dad is always scolding me.

725
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,703
Saying I don't work hard.

726
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,905
But so what if I work hard?

727
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:39,108
No matter how hard I work, dad
will never appreciate me.

728
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:42,211
I didn't cause mom's
death, I really didn't.

729
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,713
I didn't...

730
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:49,027
<i>It wasn't me...</i>

731
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,328
What are you doing?

732
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,002
Brother Xiao Hu, look over there!

733
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,008
What happened? Why is it so dark?

734
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,012
Oh dear! There's broken
glass on the toilet ﬂoor!

735
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,720
Brother Xiao Hu, be careful!
There's broken glass on the ﬂoor!

736
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,528
I saw a lizard on the wall just now,

737
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,497
so I decided to throw something at it.

738
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:38,503
Are you afraid that the
lizard will eat you up? Nuts!

739
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:45,108
Why are you wearing
so much clothes? Feeling cold?

740
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,009
I like to perspire when I sleep,

741
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,211
when whole body is wet,

742
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,413
it's easier to have wet dreams.

743
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,716
You have really gone mad
from thinking about women!

744
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,319
That hurts! Can you be more gentle?

745
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,426
All right.

746
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,227
It tickles.

747
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,229
You complain when it's too
hard, and now ticklish?

748
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,597
What you want me to do?

749
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,500
Then don't be too hard nor too soft.

750
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,903
Troublesome.

751
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,113
Stop screaming!
Are you trying to wake everyone?

752
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,323
"Hao Han Bak Kwa"

753
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,706
What are you doing?

754
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,509
How dare you mess around with my recipe?

755
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,013
Are you tired of living?

756
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:20,199
Wonderful sauce... yummy...

757
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,505
Why are you so happy?

758
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,507
I invented a new sauce.

759
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,908
I'm going to use this sauce

760
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,710
for the upcoming "Bak
Kwa King" competition.

761
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,213
And the wretch next door will be doomed.

762
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,315
Get it?

763
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,916
It smells the same.

764
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,518
What do you know?

765
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,519
Your nose is like everyone else's,

766
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,620
how can you smell it?

767
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,021
I am the only one in the world with a nose

768
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,024
that's more sensitive than a dog.

769
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,627
You smell of sweat.

770
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,597
Oh yes.

771
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,998
But I really can'! tell what's inside,

772
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,200
Actually, it's really simple.
what ingredients did you use?

773
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,904
I merely put...

774
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:59,905
Would you know if I told you?
Don'! waste my breath!

775
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,711
Hi Mrs. Toh, long time no see.

776
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,712
Boss, your regular customer is here.

777
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,013
You go and take care of it first.

778
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,715
Hi Mrs. Toh, feel free to
tell boss what you need.

779
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,717
Boss, let me help you keep this sauce.

780
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,720
<i>Never mind... I... you...</i>

781
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,023
Hey, be careful!

782
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:18,029
You haven't been here in a while.

783
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,811
Half a kilo of chicken jerked meat.

784
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,324
Thank you...

785
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:53,129
Mommy, I have something for you.

786
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:59,003
Boss, I need to go out for
a while, be back shortly.

787
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,504
Mom, I'm being followed by Chen Hao.

788
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,606
And the sauce is with me. What should I do?

789
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,109
Rule no. 9. The more afraid you are,
the more calm you must be.

790
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,611
Tum around quickly and follow him.

791
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:43,913
Really?

792
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,222
Tum around!

793
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,620
Stop! Go and look for a ladies toilet.

794
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,824
Am I not following him?
Why is he following me instead?

795
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,133
Crazy!

796
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,006
I swear I'm a woman.

797
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,611
If you don'!
believe me, I'll prove it to you.

798
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,412
Pervert!

799
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:20,418
Don'! be afraid, I'm best
at catching perverts!

800
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:34,797
Fancy a gentleman like you
being in the ladies toilet.

801
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,099
Good that you're here,
I've something to ask you.

802
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,603
Who exactly is Teh Si?

803
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,309
Is Teh Si my son?

804
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,712
Is Teh Si our son?

805
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,914
Teh Si is so young,
how could he possibly be our son?

806
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,816
He's not.
Don'! lie to me!

807
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,118
I saw it with my own eyes,
he is wearing the jade pendant.

808
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,720
We agreed a long time ago.

809
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,823
That if we had a child, we'd
let him wear the jade pendant.

810
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:04,226
Why?
Even so, that has nothing to do with you.

811
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,328
After the day you drove
Brother Wan to his death,

812
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,397
you and I had nothing more
to do with each other.

813
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,800
You were the one who killed master, not me!

814
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,802
You drove Brother Wan to his death!

815
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,003
Master was killed by you!

816
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,004
It was you who killed him!

817
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:19,010
It's you...

818
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,523
Do you really like him?

819
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,733
I like him. I'm already his woman.

820
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:43,100
Lift up your hand.

821
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:56,414
This cleaver has been
with me for more than 40 years.

822
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:06,731
I am going to give it to you now.

823
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:15,498
He was orphaned at 5. I adopted him.

824
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,899
I taught him to make jerked meat

825
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,703
and treated him like my own son.

826
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:24,406
Yet, he betrayed me.

827
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,412
Do you think you could
trust a man like him?

828
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,519
The first time I had a whiff of her scent,

829
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,822
I fell in love with her.

830
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,025
I used my life savings to purchase her.

831
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:48,026
I used my life to love her.

832
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,700
Yet, she betrayed me.

833
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:55,706
Do you think you should
love a woman like her?

834
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,113
Mei Mei, you are too forthright,

835
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,815
people read you too easily.

836
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,519
You need to master your emotions
to accomplish bigger things.

837
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,222
Hao, you need to speak your mind.

838
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,424
And be a man.

839
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:20,499
I am going to reveal to
you my secret recipe.

840
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,505
Go and die.

841
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,022
Listen up, brothers of "Bai Wan Bak Kwa".

842
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:53,996
I will give half of my inheritance to Hao.

843
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,599
And the other half to Zhen Mei Mei.

844
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,502
All of you must be united.

845
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:06,818
Don't let the "tree fall
and the monkeys scatter"!

846
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:24,028
Do you still love me?

847
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:29,700
Do you regret loving me?

848
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,917
You have not even uttered a
word, are you still a man?

849
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:46,123
Go and die!

850
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,727
What happened...
what are the two of you doing?

851
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,396
Put down the cleaver.

852
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,298
I am trying to break up with my ex-lover

853
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,399
and we are negotiating!

854
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,302
We have already broken up 28 years ago.

855
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,504
And you're negotiating only now?

856
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,005
I am slow by nature,

857
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:13,108
I like to wait for 28 years, can'! I?

858
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,910
So why do you have to negotiate
in the ladies toilet?

859
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,713
If not at ladies toilet,
should we be in the men's toilet instead?

860
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:21,719
Lame!

861
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,922
I don't know where she is.

862
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,724
She didn't answer any of my calls.

863
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,932
She didn't answer any of my calls.

864
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:37,000
Where have you been?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

865
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:45,215
That's great, now we'll
see how badly he'll fall.

866
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,217
Does this jade belong to me?

867
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,118
Is Chen Hao my father?

868
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,621
Don'! spout rubbish.

869
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,825
I heard everything that the
both of you said in the toilet.

870
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:06,797
He said this jade belongs to your child.

871
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:12,501
No wonder you sent me abroad
to study since young.

872
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,303
And now that I'm back,

873
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,705
you sent me to be a spy.

874
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,308
Actually, it's because you
don't want to see me.

875
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:23,314
You do not want me by your side.

876
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,716
Since young, no matter what I do,

877
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,619
you've never scolded me.

878
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,423
Actually, it's because
you couldn't care less.

879
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,424
Yuan.

880
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:39,430
Mom, Yuan is joking, right?

881
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,800
<i>Mom...</i>

882
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:50,305
That stingy, loud-mouthed brute of a monkey

883
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:54,311
is not my dad, right?

884
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:04,321
Yuan, I'll let you wear this necklace.

885
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:18,329
Mom, look at me.

886
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:23,605
Look at me right now!

887
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,707
When I told you I wanted
to go for plastic surgery,

888
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,209
you gave me money.

889
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,013
To get Shu Qi's lips,

890
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:35,818
Lin Chi Ling's nose, Zhao Wei's eyes.

891
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:40,322
Actually, it's because
you didn't want to see

892
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:44,827
any trace of that hateful monkey on me!

893
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,809
Why did you lie to me?

894
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:52,201
Zhen Zhen.

895
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,303
Zhen Zhen, sorry.

896
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,706
You really are me and Brother Hao's child.

897
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,914
"Hao Han Bak Kwa"

898
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,929
Big sister!

899
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,613
Big sister!
What are you doing... let go of me...

900
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:41,717
Big sister...

901
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,319
Let go of me.

902
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,425
Big sister...

903
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,925
I've checked.

904
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:53,897
Everything about you is fake.

905
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,906
Mr. Fake! It's you!

906
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,105
(You two. Pay attention)

907
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:06,909
(I'm going to film this girl)

908
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,811
(You two are in charge of her boobs)

909
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,013
(Squash them)

910
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,415
(Punch them)

911
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,717
(And make them become unbalanced breasts)

912
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,320
(You two, film her)

913
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,822
(Upload the video and
share it with the world)

914
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,030
(Understand)

915
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,411
Big sister!

916
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:41,009
Open the door...

917
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,923
Superman...

918
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,018
Don'! you do anything rash.

919
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:54,024
Superman...

920
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:18,119
Superman, don't die.

921
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,319
Big sister.

922
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:30,527
I promised you I'd protect you.

923
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:42,204
Stupid Teh Si, I'm going to kill you!

924
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,106
Teh Si!

925
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,008
Teh Si, come out right now!

926
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,910
Come out! Teh Si!

927
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:52,714
Moon river.

928
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,617
Wider than a mile.

929
01:00:55,618 --> 01:01:00,618
I'm crossing you in style, someday.

930
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:06,795
Oh dream maker.

931
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:10,599
You heart breaker.

932
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:17,808
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way.

933
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,311
Happy birthday.

934
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,518
Are you nuts?

935
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,421
Do you think you look great
dressed up like a gender-bender?

936
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:33,822
And...

937
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,725
why did you tell people
that I was your boyfriend?

938
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,395
Do you know
that the whole world now thinks I'm gay?

939
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:43,398
If you fancied men, you
should have told me earlier.

940
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:44,800
Go ahead and cross-dress
as a woman for all I care.

941
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,007
Just don't drag me into it!

942
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,712
They're both my daughters,

943
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,819
one's own child, one's adopted.

944
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:39,121
One says I don't want to see her face.

945
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:44,126
The other says I don't want
to keep her next to me.

946
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,628
I have never harbored those intentions.

947
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:50,600
Why did they say that?

948
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:02,306
Yuan always says I am
her little miss angel.

949
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:06,214
And I have really tried my
best to be their angel.

950
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,617
Do you know?

951
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,218
Mickey!

952
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:31,010
Do you know that angels come in a pair?

953
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:41,518
From now on, will you let me be your angel?

954
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,526
You've misunderstood a
situation for a long time.

955
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,303
I didn't mean to rescue
you those years ago.

956
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,100
That day, when you were locked up

957
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,303
and abandoned in that
back alley by your enemy.

958
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:06,508
I saw the ugly luggage and
thought it was in the way.

959
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,819
<i>Sol...</i>

960
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:14,015
No matter what,

961
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:18,720
let's give Yuan Yuan
and Zhen Zhen a complete family.

962
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:21,531
Shall we?

963
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,813
You put the ring on the wrong hand.

964
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,021
It should be on my right.

965
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,819
Today's the competition,

966
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,220
Superman didn't come home last night.

967
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,030
Where is he?

968
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,436
Hello, yes speaking.

969
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,797
What did you say?

970
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,699
Where is Teh Si?

971
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,702
Don'! be rash, I'll be there right away!

972
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:10,405
Hey... didn't you say
you'll stay to help me?

973
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,818
Gosh.

974
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,716
Miss Mei Mei, did you forget
today's the competition?

975
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:25,720
Wanna buy my jerked meat
to take part in the competition?

976
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,325
I'm getting married.

977
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:35,007
Do you have anything to say to me?

978
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,714
Somebody still wants you at your age?

979
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:48,005
Congratulations...

980
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:51,913
Don'! you want to know who the groom is?

981
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,316
Does it matter who it is?

982
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:59,027
You're getting married,
the groom is not me.

983
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,829
Congratulations...

984
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:08,997
ls the boss of "Hao Han Bak Kwa" in?

985
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,098
<i>Who?
Yes...</i>

986
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,199
Me.

987
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,500
From the Public Health Department.

988
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,402
Yes sir...

989
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:18,907
I received complaints that
there were rats here.

990
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:20,108
You must be joking,

991
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,710
I've been here for so many years

992
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:24,012
and I've never seen a rat.

993
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,916
We sell jerked meat here, not rat meat.

994
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:33,332
We'll know only after checking.

995
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,326
Hey good-looking, I dropped my ring.

996
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,296
It's not convenient for me
to bend down and get it.

997
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,797
Can you help me please?

998
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,800
Please...

999
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,206
It's over there...

1000
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,109
Look out for my diamond...

1001
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,818
Be careful... it's expensive.

1002
01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,816
Have you found it?

1003
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,819
Okay?

1004
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,922
You're so kind, thank you.

1005
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,024
What sound is that?

1006
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,126
No, nothing.

1007
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,328
Tum around and show me.

1008
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:16,297
Did you hear me?

1009
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,799
What is that?

1010
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,300
Open up your mouth.

1011
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,602
Open it up...

1012
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,203
Open up your mouth.

1013
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,911
I want you to open up your mouth.

1014
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,513
I want you to open up your mouth right now!

1015
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:34,120
Open your mouth! Now!

1016
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,822
Open your mouth!

1017
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:44,025
Two of you, open up your mouths!

1018
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,336
Right now!

1019
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:24,199
Can you not be so intimate in front of me?

1020
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,613
I can't take it anymore!

1021
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,312
You said there were no rats at here?

1022
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:49,030
Teh Si!

1023
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,827
Hello!
Teh Si!

1024
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,596
Mickey Mouse?

1025
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:55,797
So it was you who called me.

1026
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,298
It was you who told where is Teh Si.

1027
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,399
Where is Teh Si?

1028
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,102
Our Little Miss Yuan Yuan
came home with crying last night.

1029
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:03,208
With your palm print still on her face.

1030
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,209
Defeat me and I'll let you go.

1031
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,814
Let's begin!

1032
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:17,418
Stand properly...
hold on, I'm not even perspiring yet.

1033
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,419
Again!

1034
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,022
<i>This... the nose.</i>

1035
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,025
That's right, it'll be the nose.

1036
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:47,021
<i>You...</i>

1037
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,518
Teh Si...

1038
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,620
Are you all right?

1039
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:56,626
I'm all right.
At most, I lose my nose only.

1040
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,327
I've already warned you.

1041
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,496
You are to give 3 rubbers,

1042
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:03,698
2 rulers and 1 sticker each week.

1043
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,906
Why have you not given me yet?

1044
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,818
Eyes, mouth or nose?

1045
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,219
Are you all right?

1046
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,531
I'm all right.
At most, I lose my nose only.

1047
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:34,625
You mean you are the one who...

1048
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,798
I'm her.

1049
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,008
That's me.

1050
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,323
You're awake.

1051
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,130
Who are you?

1052
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:06,437
Who exactly are you?

1053
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,319
I'm sorry.

1054
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,820
I'm Mei Mei's foster daughter,

1055
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,222
lam Zhen Yuan Yuan.

1056
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:36,324
I've been sent
by "Mei Mei Bak Kwa" as an undercover.

1057
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:37,925
I know I look neither
like a man nor a woman.

1058
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,997
But I like you!

1059
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:53,207
Actually...

1060
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:57,213
I have had someone in my
heart for a long time.

1061
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,722
That's her.

1062
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,636
Who is she?

1063
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:19,211
That cute girl really looks like me.

1064
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:49,398
Don'! move...

1065
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,811
Superman.

1066
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,913
It's me. Big sister.

1067
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,116
Look at me.

1068
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:09,617
You're all right now.

1069
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,419
Where are the bad guys?

1070
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:16,023
All the bad guys are gone.

1071
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,525
Big sister.

1072
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,026
Don'! move...

1073
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,095
Although I'm injured,

1074
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,798
Don'! move.
I can still protect you.

1075
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,507
Lie down!

1076
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,103
You don'! have to protect me anymore.

1077
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:34,104
From now on, I will protect you.

1078
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:37,011
Why are you the one protecting me?

1079
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:42,621
You're hurt, of course big
sister will protect you.

1080
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,728
But, I'm Superman

1081
01:13:55,097 --> 01:14:02,003
You're Superman, then I am Wonder woman!

1082
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,505
I'm going to hit you...

1083
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,507
The arm is bent.
I'll certainly win you.

1084
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,608
The arm is bent?

1085
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:08,810
It's okay, I'll beat you...

1086
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:12,113
and bend the arm again

1087
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,422
How dare you whack me?

1088
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,222
There were some old men who
tried to take advantage of me.

1089
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:23,724
When they groped me, they were shocked!

1090
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:28,396
"King of jerked meat" What?

1091
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:32,402
I counted, there were a
total of 17 of them.

1092
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:38,414
Why? Gone speechless after winning
the "Bak Kwa King" competition?

1093
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:44,612
Let me ask you, why were there rats?

1094
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:48,618
Why was he disqualified?

1095
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,120
I told you.

1096
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:57,425
I will never let anyone bully you.

1097
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,235
You!

1098
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,105
You're back?

1099
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:45,106
And we have guests?

1100
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,008
Come... come have a seat.

1101
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,210
<i>Come... come this way...</i>

1102
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,817
Come sit over here...

1103
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:58,619
<i>Sit... come sit.</i>

1104
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,221
Come, come here...

1105
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,327
<i>Sit...</i>

1106
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:07,405
It's good that all of you are back.

1107
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,898
I cooked a lot of dishes today.

1108
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,503
Since you came back together,
have it while it's warm.

1109
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,507
Infernal Affairs?

1110
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:23,711
Actually, it's tough being a
spy and is very stressful.

1111
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,713
I'm sure your health is not good.

1112
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:26,714
See? How skinny are you.

1113
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,317
Drink more.

1114
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:33,020
This soup is suitable
for both man and woman.

1115
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,627
Here.

1116
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:41,395
Xiao Hu, you should try to drink less.

1117
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:44,298
You have a lot of potential.

1118
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,500
If one day, you are to
strike out on your own,

1119
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,403
you will certainly succeed.

1120
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,806
Drink!

1121
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:54,408
Come.

1122
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,111
Why? Got hurt?

1123
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,212
I won'! ask,

1124
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:02,817
but you must have gotten hurt
while saving someone, right?

1125
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:05,519
Superman has to take care of many people.

1126
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,522
So you need to learn how
to take care of yourself.

1127
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:11,125
Understand?

1128
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,037
Drink!

1129
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,898
It's your first time come to my home.

1130
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,301
I don't have much to offer.

1131
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,303
Here, have some soup.

1132
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:26,107
If you like it, you can
come over more often to have it.

1133
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,908
Don'! stand on ceremony.

1134
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,711
Since I'm going to be
very free from now on.

1135
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,413
Try it.

1136
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,616
Drink up.

1137
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:39,622
Drink up everyone...

1138
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,994
Look at the sumptuous spread today.

1139
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,796
There's chicken, duck, fish, soup...

1140
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,504
except bak kwa.

1141
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:57,405
You guys must be the happiest, am I right?

1142
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,907
There is something else
that will make you even happier.

1143
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,514
We don'! have to sell jerked
meat in future anymore.

1144
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,518
And you no longer have to
eat leftover jerked meat.

1145
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,521
Happy...

1146
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,000
Master.

1147
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:31,505
There're decades ago when I first
learned to make jerked meat from you.

1148
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:34,608
I bathed for 3 hours daily

1149
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,911
with the most fragrant soap.

1150
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,119
But there is still this smell on me.

1151
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:45,619
Sometimes when I'm about to sleep,

1152
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:49,324
I can even smell jerked meat on myself.

1153
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,095
But today, they're telling me

1154
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,097
they want to close down my shop.

1155
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:59,511
They say I can'! sell jerked meat anymore.

1156
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:12,012
I can no longer sell jerked meat.

1157
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:15,516
I'm sorry, master, I'm sorry...

1158
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:21,622
I have mined the business
you worked so hard for.

1159
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:24,425
I'm sorry...

1160
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,794
I'm a lousy disciple.

1161
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,497
I'm a lousy person.

1162
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,398
Just like what you said,

1163
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:36,806
When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter!

1164
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:44,614
When the leader falls,
his followers disperse.

1165
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:51,218
We just like the tree has fallen,
the monkeys has scattered.

1166
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:55,224
The tree has fallen, the
monkeys has scattered...

1167
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,813
I'm sorry.

1168
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:22,616
I caused "Hao Han Bak Kwa" to shut down.

1169
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:26,020
No doubt I have won
the "Bak Kwa King" competition,

1170
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:31,926
But I don’t feel good not being
able to compete with you.

1171
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,407
I would like to challenge you one on one.

1172
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,500
Forget it if you don'! want.

1173
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,302
Your shop has been getting smaller,

1174
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:42,903
your business is getting lesser.

1175
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:43,804
Your customers are getting older,

1176
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,115
you might as well shut it down.

1177
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,222
What are you doing? You wretch.

1178
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:03,424
You are disqualified
for the worshiping of Brother Wan.

1179
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:04,825
Why can'! I?

1180
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,994
So what if you won?

1181
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,696
You won only because I wasn't competing.

1182
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,198
If I was competing, would
you even stand a chance?

1183
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,701
Oh really? Don'! just talk!

1184
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,303
If you're man enough,
compete with me one on one.

1185
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:18,606
Sure! Who's afraid who?

1186
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,507
Without any publicity, nor packaging.

1187
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:21,508
And no machinery.

1188
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:22,810
Using only manual labour.

1189
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:25,212
Sure, whoever does the best jerked meat

1190
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,214
will be the King of Jerked Meat.

1191
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,126
On...

1192
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:38,025
We will soon reveal who the
King of Jerked Meat is.

1193
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:41,595
Old customer will try
the jerked meat later.

1194
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:47,501
Whoever he picks will be the winner.

1195
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:51,507
Let the competition begin!

1196
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,309
Dad, is this meat all right?

1197
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:59,013
If you're skilled, you can
use any meat you like!

1198
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,514
So what if you have good
facilities, but no skills,

1199
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,216
you will still lose until you call mom.

1200
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,317
Call mom...

1201
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,019
Good...

1202
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,321
When choosing meat, always select the best.

1203
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,824
Choose meat imported from
Texas USA, Baytown Poultry.

1204
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,626
Always be the first in what you do.

1205
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:15,596
Don'! be like those who always lose.

1206
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,799
Always the no. 1 loser...

1207
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,902
When slicing, you must be fast and quick.

1208
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:24,204
Slice it into two, clean and good.

1209
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:27,808
Don'! be wishy-washy and draggy.

1210
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:30,511
Not only must you be quick,
you must be sharp.

1211
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:33,914
Be careful when you are
slicing, and do it slowly.

1212
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:38,419
If not, you will cut your finger
and bring it to the grill.

1213
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,921
And what comes out
will not be a slice of jerked meat.

1214
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:43,924
But a stick of jerked meat.

1215
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:45,225
What are you doing?

1216
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:48,595
When marinating the meat, do it generously.

1217
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:52,099
Only then will the meat
be properly marinated

1218
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,201
and achieving consistency.

1219
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:57,905
Unlike some people who look kind
but are evil on the inside.

1220
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,307
Despicable and shameless!

1221
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,109
I spit on you!

1222
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:02,815
<i>Spit...</i>

1223
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:07,214
Marinating takes time,

1224
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,416
we'd need half an hour to season this

1225
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,618
Nothing more, nothing less.

1226
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:15,622
Only then will it be the best!

1227
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,725
That's why I always say,

1228
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:22,296
Research and development is very important!

1229
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:27,001
What I’ve just said must sound
very complicated for some people.

1230
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,002
My apologies.

1231
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,313
Said enough? Start grilling!

1232
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:37,011
<i>Quick...</i>

1233
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,012
Are you blind?

1234
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,113
Can't you see there's no more meat?

1235
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:41,115
Okay...

1236
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:43,517
You see...
he always likes to talk back to me.

1237
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,518
Dad, have some water.

1238
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:45,827
Water.

1239
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:50,524
Okay done, smells good.

1240
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:54,395
Bring the dish...

1241
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:55,996
How can you be his dad?

1242
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:56,997
Who are you?
What are you doing?

1243
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:57,998
How could you keep scolding him?

1244
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:59,900
Why not? He's my son,
none of your business!

1245
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,503
Not only am I going to scold him,
I'm even going to beat him!

1246
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:06,509
I'm going to shield him...

1247
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,114
Come, let me wipe the sweat from your face.
Don'! beat him again.

1248
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:16,220
Why don'! you wipe yourself instead?

1249
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,316
There's no need to compete anymore.

1250
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:50,719
It's burnt.
I said stop the competition!

1251
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,897
I've lost.

1252
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:06,100
Our sauces maybe the same,

1253
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,302
but your tastes better.

1254
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:09,303
You haven't even tried it,

1255
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:11,605
how'd you know?

1256
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,607
There isn't any secret family recipe.

1257
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:20,015
The secret is when a family gets
together to make jerked meat.

1258
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:29,723
True flavour can only be attained

1259
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:33,035
when you grill bak kwa
together as a family.

1260
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:39,700
You're the real Jerked Meat King.

1261
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,703
<i>Dad...</i>

1262
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:54,414
My business has been suspended anyway.

1263
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:57,217
This no longer holds any
meaning for me anymore.

1264
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,027
You can have it back.

1265
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:18,611
Brother Hao!

1266
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,616
Be careful!

1267
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:29,316
Brother Hao!

1268
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:31,919
Brother Hao! Are you all right?

1269
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,620
Dad!
Get up!

1270
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,923
<i>Dad...</i>

1271
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:37,624
Are you okay?

1272
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,026
I'm all right, don'! worry...

1273
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,802
I'm just feeling a little cold...

1274
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:47,000
Can you hold me tight?

1275
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,003
Zhen Mei Mei!

1276
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:59,413
You're disappointed me.

1277
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,917
Go and die!

1278
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,024
Dad!
Brother Hao!

1279
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:12,726
Boss!

1280
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,195
Dad, are you all right?
Dad!

1281
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:16,997
Brother Hao, wake up!

1282
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:18,807
Help him!

1283
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:24,004
Are you okay?

1284
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:25,405
I'm okay.

1285
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:30,711
I learned 'steel head kung fu'
when I was young, I'm fine.

1286
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:34,314
Mei Mei, I've been meaning to tell
you something for the past 28 years.

1287
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:36,124
I'm going to tell you today.

1288
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:42,026
Do you still love me?

1289
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,201
I love you.

1290
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:56,803
Please come in...

1291
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:59,106
"Half a year later"
Please come in...

1292
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,808
You look exactly like me.

1293
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,110
Even though you've had plastic surgery,

1294
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,111
you still resemble me.

1295
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,612
Beautiful!

1296
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:09,622
Doesn't that mean I've to go
for plastic surgery again?

1297
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:12,419
I don't want to be a woman anymore.

1298
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,021
I want to go back to being a man!

1299
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,522
Nope, you said it before.

1300
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:18,125
You will cross dress for as
long as I did the last time.

1301
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,230
And your time is not up yet.

1302
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:24,097
Is it nice?

1303
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:25,098
Tastes great.

1304
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:26,300
Are you happy?

1305
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,803
Absolutely!

1306
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,104
What flavour jerked meat is this?

1307
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:32,709
Beer jerked meat!
