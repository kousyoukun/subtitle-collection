18
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,660
我只是有一点吃惊
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

19
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,250
你为这个项目工作多久了?

20
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,900
从一开始我就跟着美国队

21

实际上  我在特别为你召开并已结束的蒙索罗会议上见过你

22
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,890
特别为法国人  祝贺你-如果还不算晚的话

It's that training mission from the naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.

34
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,200
他们当时在旧船上测试目标

35
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,820
谁还会用这个飞行?
Who flies crates like these anymore?

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,790
没有人  这些飞机在1945年就失踪了

44
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,030
被太阳晒伤了?

他说太阳昨天晚上出来了
He says the sun came out last night.

指挥中心  东31

此飞机飞行不低于我们
The traffic's not lower than us.

65
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,700
它现在在1点钟方向  仍旧在我上方并正在下降
He's 1:00 now, still above me and descending.

66

说实话  目标非常明显
To tell you the truth, the target is rather brilliant.

我想东面有着陆导航灯亮着
I thought Air East had his landing lights on.

75
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,200
可能是卫星

好的  东31飞机已转弯
Okay, Center, Air East 31. The traffic has turned.

Do you have test operations in restricted area 2508?

90
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,050
东31  收到

你自己解决自己的难题

115
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,030
我不明白这些分数

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,340
那个车子有60英尺长

121
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,720
三分之一穿过这个路口

122
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,270
现在另一部火车来了

123

124
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,730
才能使另一部火车不撞上它?
so that the other train doesn't smash it?

135
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,350
这个能招破伤风
This can cause tetanus!

136
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,180
-这是什么?  -你知道正在放什么么?
- What is this? - You know what's playing?

137
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,270
皮诺乔  孩子们从来没看过看皮诺乔
Pinocchio! The kids have never seen Pinocchio.

138
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,100
你们从来没看过你们会喜欢的
You guys have never seen it. You'll love it.

139
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,560
我不相信这个
I don't believe this.

140
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,400
谁会想去看这些只能给小孩看得无声卡通?
Who wants to go see some dumb cartoon rated G for kids?

141
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,530
-你几岁了?  -8岁
- How old are you? - Eight.

142
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,450
-你想要变成9岁么?  -是的
- You want to be 9? - Yeah.

143
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,320
那你明天晚上就要看皮诺乔
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio tomorrow night.

144
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,700
这样就能赢过你的孩子真厉害
That's a wonderful way to win over your children.

145
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,950
我又不是认真的  我只是想说皮诺乔是伴随着我长大的
I'm not serious. I'm just saying that I grew up with Pinocchio.

146
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,090
如果小孩子仍旧是小孩子  他们就应该看
And if kids are still kids, they're gonna eat it up.

147
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,160
好吧  我错了  我总是错的行了吧?
Okay, I'm wrong. I'm Wrong Roy, all right?

148
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,220
托比 你就要死了出来
Toby! You are close to death! Come out here!

149
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,970
我给你们自己选择  我不会偏心
I'll give you your choice. I'm not gonna be biased in any way.

150
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,550
你可以去玩高尔夫  
Tomorrow night you can either play Goofy Golf,

151
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,800
那意味着你要等很久还要拖拖拉拉最后只得个0分
which means a lot of waiting and shouting and pushing and probably getting a zero...

152
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,190
或者你可以看皮诺乔
or you can see Pinocchio...

153
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,860
意味着有很多动物  魔法以及欢乐时光
which is a lot of furry animals and magic and a wonderful time.

154
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,360
-现在我们来投票  -高尔夫
- Now, let's vote. - Golf!

155
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,200
好吧  每个人都上床去
All right, everybody to bed!

156
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,530
不行  爸爸说我们可以看完10戒
No way! Dad said we could finish watching The Ten Commandments!

157
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,120
洛伊  那个电影有4小时那么长
Roy, that movie is four hours long.

158
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,790
我告诉过他们他们只能看前5戒
I told them they'd watch only five commandments.

159
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,460
洛尼  我是伊尔
Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.

160
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,920
我们有大问题了  我需要你丈夫来
We got a big problem. I need your old man in the field.

161
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,120
如果我不在车上  洛伊晚上不能开车
Roy can't drive at night without me.

162
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,500
我们正全面停电
We're experiencing an overall outage!

163
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,670
等一下  我不能  亲爱的
Wait, wait, wait. I can't... Hey, honey!

164
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,920
快一点  是伊尔打来的
Jiminy cricket. It's Earl on the phone.

165
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,220
尼瑞  快开车去托罗诺的N线报道
Neary. Get into your truck and report to line N in Tolono.

166
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,430
我们这边没电了  你们那边停电了没有?
We're losing power across the grid. Has the outage hit you yet?

167
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,800
尼瑞?
Neary?

168
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,980
别关灯
Hey! Lights!

169
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,550
巴里
Barry!

170
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,990
我迷路了
Help! I'm lost.

171
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,450
你要去托罗诺  对吧?
You're gonna cough up a little Tolono, right?

172
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,120
现在在州际90号公路上
Cough up Tolono on Interstate Highway 90.

173
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,790
看看有什么熟悉的路标
A little familiar landmark of some sort.

174
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,910
-科布莱德路  南20  -科布莱德?
- Cornbread Road, south of 20. - Cornbread?

175
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,040
电力一定已经恢复了
Power must have been restored.

176
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,460
好几百个邻居以为这是星期六晚上
Couple hundred neighbors think it's Saturday night.

177
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,750
调度  这里是411
Dispatch, this is 411.

178
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,840
你要我不去托罗诺了吗?
Do you want me to disregard that Tolono call?

179
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,300
你堵在路中间了  笨蛋
You're in the middle of the road, jackass!

180
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,970
你能告诉我哪里是科布莱德路么?  傻瓜?
Can you tell me where Cornbread is? Turkey!

181
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,370
834... 834... F-27.

182
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,790
M-玛丽-10 到 M-玛丽-12
M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12. Okay.

183
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,800
听在环形炉上哪里都去不了
Stoppage in the single circuits will lead you right to nowhere.

184
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,100
M-玛丽-10
M-Mary-10.

185
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,430
糟了
Oh, shit!

186
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,490
你们在那里看到了什么?
What do you guys got out there?

187
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,990
我无法相信
I don't believe this!

188
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,780
天 它象房子一样大
My God! It's as big as a house!

189
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,120
象谷仓一样
Shaped like a barn.

190
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,080
这简直疯了
This is absolutely crazy.

191
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,130
就在Telemark高速公路尽头和HarPer Valley(地名)东面
Just off the Telemark Expressway and east toward Harper Valley.

192
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,850
不
No!

193
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,480
小心
Watch out!

194
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,980
天哪女士
Oh, my God! Lady!

195
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,740
你没事吧? 对不起
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

196
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,450
我没有看见她  他在路中间
I didn't see him. He was in the middle of the road.

197
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,460
这里
Hello! Here!

198
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,290
你怎么啦
What's the matter with you?

199
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,420
巴里  回来
Barry, come back here!

200
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,980
冰淇淋
Ice cream!

201
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,800
真是疯了
This is nuts.

202
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,660
等一下
Wait a minute!

203
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,830
你们在做什么嗨
What are you guys doing? Hey!

204
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,750
那是俄亥俄  要付2角5分
That's Ohio! That's a quarter!

205
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,590
天哪  看看这些恶心的东西
Jesus, look at those suckers. They're glued to the road!

206
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,010
亲爱的  起来
Honey, wake up!

207
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,840
洛尼  醒来  你不会相信我看到什么
Ronnie, wake up! You're not gonna believe what I saw!

208
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,720
不要
Don't! Not now.

209
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,680
不  听着  我从来不会相信它
No, listen! I never would have believed it!

210
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,470
是这样的  在车里有一整个
There was this... In the cab there was this whole...

211
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,310
它走了  一个红颜色的  呼的一声
It went... It was... There was a red whoosh that...

212
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,520
洛伊
Roy.

213
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,900
埃克打电话给你
Ike called you.

214
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,400
还有格文
And McGovern.

215
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,070
他们让你打给他们他们找不到你
They want you to call. They couldn't reach you.

216
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,890
我关了收音机
I turned the radio off.

217
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,320
别这样电话震天响
Don't do that. The phone rang off the hook.

218
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,150
已经吵醒塞维亚2次了  你最好打给他们
It woke Sylvia up two times already. You'd better call them.

219
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,620
你从国家地里杂志上看到过这些极光的图片对吗?
You know those pictures in National Geographic, the aurora borealis?

220
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,450
这个比那个还要好
This is better than that. Come on!

221
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,620
来吧  洛尼  起来
Come on, Ronnie, get up.

222
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,990
-怎么了?  -没什么  我不知道
- What's wrong? - Nothing is wrong. I don't know.

223
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,500
起来  起来  不是开玩笑
Get up, get up! I'm not kidding.

224
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,300
-快点  -发生事故了?
- Come on, - Is it an accident?

225
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,670
没发生事故  你想到外面去  对么?
No, it's not an accident. You wanted out of the house, right?

226
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,500
但不是在凌晨4点的时候
Not at 4:00 in the morning.

227
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,260
洛尼  我需要你来和我一起看一些东西
Ronnie, I need you to see something with me.

228
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,260
真得很重要
It's really important.

229
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,050
好吧  好吧  孩子怎么办?
Okay. All right. What about the kids?

230
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,010
什么?  噢孩子 我会带上孩子
What? Oh, the kids! I'll get the kids.

231
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,270
塞维亚  我们要去冒险了
Sylvia, we're going on an adventure.

232
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,310
托比布拉得 来吧 起来
Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.

233
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,060
比高尔夫还要好玩
It's better than Goofy Golf!

234
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,820
我已经走得够快了
I'm going as fast as I can!

235
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,940
来吧
Come on.

236
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,110
嗨  哈里斯夫人
Hi, Mrs. Harris.

237
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,990
洛伊  哈里斯夫人在那里
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.

238
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,030
你最好有一个好理由
There better be a good reason for this...

239
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,740
因为这实在是没道理
because it doesn't make sense!

240
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,030
好吧  罗伊  我实在是想听听你的解释
All right, Roy, I really think you've proved your point.

241
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,700
你被太阳晒伤了  看看你
You're sunburned. Look at you.

242
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,630
亲爱的  那是什么?
Honey, what is that?

243
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,680
洛伊  那个看上去是怎样的?
Roy, what did it look like?

244
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,890
像一个圆筒冰淇淋
It was like an ice-cream cone.

245
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,220
什么味道的?
What flavor?

246
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,720
桔子味的
Orange.

247
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,150
是桔子味  它不像一个圆筒冰淇淋
It was orange. It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.

248
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,900
它更像一个贝壳  好比这样
It was more like a shell. You know like this.

249
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,600
像墨西哥薄饼那样?
Like a taco?

250
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
它是不是象那些萨拉・李做的月亮形的饼干?
Was it like one of those Sara Lee moon-shaped cookies?

251
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,990
那些新月形的饼干么?
Those crescent cookies?

252
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,160
你不觉得我做饼干很拿手么?
Don't you think I'm taking this really well?

253
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,660
我记得以前我们来过类似的地方  
I remember coming to places like this...

254
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,750
当时我们什么也不做  就静静的互望着
just to look at each other.

255
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,800
依偎在一起
Snuggle.

256
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,380
我不相信  我不相信
I don't believe it. I don't believe it!

257
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,540
我无法相信
I don't believe it.

258
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,790
是科多帕希号
It's the Cotopaxi.

259
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,100
-为什么它在这里?  -打死我也想不通
- Why is it here? - Beats the shit out of me.

260
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,400
5郡不明飞行物
印第安纳嗡嗡响

261
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,740
这是浴室么?
Is this the bathroom?

262
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,010
这个不是你们的玩具
This is not your toy to play with every time I turn around.

263
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,060
看爸爸的阴阳脸
He looks like a 50/50 Bar.

264
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,890
好了都出去  你们所有人都出去
All right, out of this house. All of you. Out of my house.

265
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,470
很抱歉  但是你们不能再玩这个了
I'm sorry, but you're not to play with this ever!

266
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,360
在我打扫完这一堆烂摊子前别进来
Get out while I clean up your mess!

267
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,480
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

268
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,250
我找到这个黄颜色的东西
I found this overnight tanning stuff.

269
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,410
你喷在半边脸上  这样2边脸就可以变成一个颜色了
I want you to spray it on half your face, so it's all one color.

270
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,670
这个会让我的脸看上去黄黄的  这个让你想到了什么?
It makes my face look yellow. What does this remind you of?

271
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,720
那么我们就告诉大家你在太阳灯下
Then we'll tell everybody you fell asleep...

272
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,800
侧着半边脸睡着了
under the sun lamp on your right side.

273
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,380
为什么?
What for?

274
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,380
爸爸  我可以问你一个问题么?
Dad, can I ask you a question?

275
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,100
他们是不是真的?
Are they for real?

276
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,810
那就是为什么
That's what for.

277
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,400
不  他们不是真的
No, they are not for real.

278
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,940
出去给自己买个热狗  好么?
Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?

279
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,770
洛伊  不要这样告诉他
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

280
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,650
不要这样讲  直到你知道自己在说什么
Don't talk about this until you know what you're talking about.

281
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,900
如果我不说  我怎么知道会发生什么事情?
If I can't talk about it, how will I know what's going on?

282
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,270
什么事情?
What?

283
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,030
妈妈  我相信它们
Mom, I believe in them.

284
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,030
我也相信它们
I believe in them too.

285
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,620
不  你不相信
No, you don't.

286
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,490
爸爸叫我们相信
Dad says we do.

287
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,540
不  他没有
No, he does not.

288
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,610
你是么  洛伊?
Do you, Roy?

289
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,330
我只是想知道接下来会怎样
All I want to do is know what's going on.

290
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,710
没什么会发生  只不过是那些事情
Nothing's going on! It's just one of those things.

291
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,710
什么事情?什么事情?
Which things? Which things?

292
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,080
-我不想再听到这些了  -这个是非常重要的
- I don't want to hear about this. - This is very important!

293
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,180
我不会让这件事情就这样结束的  我要告诉别人
I won't let it lay here. I'm gonna call somebody!

294
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,550
我不听  我不听
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

295
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,470
昨天晚上我看到了一些无法解释的东西
I saw something last night that I can't explain.

296
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,140
昨天晚上我看到的事情我可以解释
I saw something last night I can't explain.

297
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,390
我今天晚上会再去那里的
I'm going out there again tonight.

298
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,900
不  你不能去
No, you're not.

299
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,860
我要去
Yes, I am.

300
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,650
不  你不能去
No, you're not.

301
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,140
我要去
Yes, I am.

302
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,030
不  你不能去
No, you're not.

303
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,570
他们生活在月亮上么?
Do they live on the moon?

304
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,040
它们的基地在那里  所以晚上他们会来到你的窗前
They got bases there so at night they can come through your window.

305
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,370
这不是被月亮晒伤的  该死
This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it!

306
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,500
-是你昨天晚上来爬我的窗子  -你弄痛我了
- You came through my window last. - You hurt me!

307
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,380
-你卷走了我的被子  -洛伊不是那样的
- You took all my covers. - Roy's not like that.

308
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,160
他喜欢他的工作  不要那样说
He loves his work. Don't say that!

309
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,840
他做了什么了?  他昨天一晚上和我们在一起
What did he do? He was with us all night!

310
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,550
我今天晚上不一定去
I won't have to go tonight.

311
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,510
他不是那样的
He is not like that at all!

312
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,090
不要再对我叫了
Stop yelling at me!

313
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,550
你不能跟他讲么?
Can't you tell him about this?

314
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,050
喂?
Hello?

315
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,140
我不能相信
I can't believe it.

316
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,630
洛伊
Roy...

317
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,640
你被解雇了
you got fired.

318
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,680
他们甚至不想跟你讲话
They didn't even want to talk to you.

319
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,730
印度北部  达兰萨拉

320
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,400
我想知道...  你们是从哪个方向听到这些声音的?

321
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,370
这些声音都是从哪里来的?
Where were the sounds coming from?

322
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,110
这些声音都是从哪里来的?  请告诉我
Where did these sounds come from? Tell us, please.

323
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,000
这些声音是从哪儿来的?

324
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,670
晚上好  女士们先生们
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

325
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,050
请再说一遍  我的英文也不好
I beg your pardon, but my English is not good too.

326
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,300
我想和大家分享
I want to share with you now...

327
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,600
我们在印度取得的突破
the breakthrough that happened in India.

328
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,430
我们认为它意味着些什么
We think it means something.

329
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,400
我们认为它是重要的
We think it is important.

330
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,800
为了帮助你们了解  
To help you learn,

331
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,940
我在使用由佐尔坦・柯达伊创造的手语
I am using the hand sign created by Zoltan Kodaly.

332
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,320
柯达伊用这些手语来教耳聋的孩子学习音乐
Kodaly developed these signs to teach music to deaf children.

333
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,940
你好?
Hello?

334
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,370
你好么?  你也来这儿了?
Hi, how are you? You came here too?

335
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,000
嗯来了  我是季连・盖勒
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

336
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,750
罗伊・尼瑞  上次的事情真抱歉
Roy Neary. I'm sorry about what happened with kids.

337
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,100
怎么了?
What?

338
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,780
看看你
Look at you.

339
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,910
你也晒伤了
You got the same burn.

340
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,080
但你的比我好  你至少全晒到了
Yeah, but it's better on you. You got it all over at least.

341
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,750
我今晚要晒到另一半
I gotta tan the other side tonight.

342
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,410
孩子怎样?  我真的很抱歉
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

343
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,490
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

344
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,990
抬起头  笑一个
Raise your head a bit and give me a smile.

345
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,080
他太小了不适合作记录  你认为呢?
He's a little young for a record, don't you think?

346
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,220
奇怪
Weird.

347
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,640
我知道这听起来很疯狂  但是自从昨天在路上
I know this sounds crazy, but ever since yesterday on the road...

348
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,310
我看到这个形状
I've been seeing this shape.

349
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,690
冰淇淋的形状
In shaving cream and pillows...

350
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,370
我知道这个我知道这是什么
Damn it, I know this! I know what this is.

351
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,460
这意味着什么
This means something.

352
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,710
很重要
This is important.

353
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,840
他们来了
Here they come!

354
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,470
准备好照相机
Get the camera!

355
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,510
在西北方向
Out of the northwest!

356
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,820
这就像成年人的万圣节
It's like Halloween for grownups.

357
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,990
不给糖果就捣乱
Trick or treat.

358
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,310
等一下
Wait a minute!

359
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,480
这些式样是
The patterns are:

360
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,440
-我们收到2段15分钟的广播  -有规律的讯号?
- We received two 15-minute broadcasts. - Non-random signals?

361
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,140
104次迅速的脉动  5秒钟间隔后  40次脉动
104 rapid pulses. After a five-second interval, 40 pulses.

362
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,770
另外5秒钟间隔  然后是30次脉动
Another five-second break, and 30 pulses.

363
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,700
戈德斯通射电望远镜
14号站

364
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,770
静止  然后一组新的数字  
60 seconds of silence, then a new set of numbers.

365
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,100
40  中断5秒钟  36  中断5秒钟  10
40, break five. 36, break five. Ten.

366
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,150
-104次迅速脉动  -老天
- 104 rapid pulses. - Lord!

367
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,110
60秒后整个过程开始重复
Wait 60 seconds and the whole doggone thing repeats.

368
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,500
-讯号从哪里来的?  -就在附近
- Where are the signals from? - The neighborhood.

369
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,670
光旅行的时间  大概7秒
Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.

370
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,040
正好在黄道平面上
Well within the plane of the ecliptic.

371
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,980
这些有规律的信号  
Are these non-random signals here,

372
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,540
40  36  10  是响应那个的么?
40, 36, 10, in response to that?

373
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,470
应该是  我们已经发送这个组合好几星期了
No, they should be. We've sent this combination out for weeks.

374
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,050
我们得回来的只是数字
All we're getting back are numbers.

375
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,640
这也可能说明印度的音乐进了一个死胡同
This could mean the India sounds reached a dead end.

376
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,260
他们并不说明任何问题
They don't mean a thing.

377
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,520
有很多我们不知道的事情
There's so much we don't know.

378
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,350
那些信号从哪里来的?
How about where the signals originate?

379
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,740
对不起
Excuse me.

380
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,020
什么字母是104?
What letter is 104?

381
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,780
对不起
Excuse me.

382
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,080
我在做法语翻译之前
Before I got paid to speak French...

383
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,790
是绘制地图的
I used to read maps.

384
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,250
这第一个数字是经度
This first number is a longitude.

385
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,340
2组3个号码
Two sets of three numbers.

386
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,510
度  分和秒
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

387
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,930
第一个号码有3个数字  最后2个数字小于60
The first number has three digits, and the last two are below 60.

388
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,100
这不是在空中上升或下降
It's not in the right ascension and declination on the sky.

389
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,850
这一定是地球坐标
These have to be Earth coordinates.

390
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,060
办公室有一个地球仪
There's a globe in the office.

391
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,900
这就是我们需要的
This is what we need.

392
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,610
可能有一个钉子在下面
Maybe there's a release pin underneath here.

393
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,900
这个地球仪要2500元  你们在做什么?
That's a $2500 globe! What are you doing?

394
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,380
好了各位  安静  放下来
All right, everybody, quiet down! Hold it down!

395
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,980
天线  真是愚蠢
The antenna. How dumb!

396
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,430
-这指的是哪个方向?  -东北
- Which way's it pointing? - Northeast.

397
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,800
那是怀俄明州
That's Wyoming.

398
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,440
我们需要怀俄明州的地理勘测地图
We'll need a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.

399
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:04,520
找一个正方形的空地
I want it to the square yard.

400
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,280
军队有怀俄明州的地理勘测地图
The Army has a geodetic survey map of Wyoming.

401
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,700
玩具
Toys!

402
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:03,750
玩具
Toys!

403
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,600
我的天
Oh, my God!

404
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,050
你可以出来玩了
You can come and play now.

405
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,100
你可以出来玩了
You can come and play now.

406
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,600
从门里进来吧
Come in through the door.

407
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,280
1...  2...  3...  
One... two... three...

408
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,750
妈妈  看  这里有个太阳
Mom, look! The sun's here!

409
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,520
Oh, my God!
上帝啊!

410
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,090
走开
Go away!

411
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,750
把东西理好
Clean everything up!

412
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,150
-妈妈  让我听  -等一下
- Mom, let me listen! - Wait a minute!

413
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,340
妈妈  看
Mom, look!

414
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,420
从门这里进来
Come in through the door.

415
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,130
巴里
Barry!

416
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,140
我们能做个声明吗?
May we have a statement?

417
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,230
你给警察的报告真是令人瞩目
The report you gave to the police was spectacular.

418
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,560
我们要用它来做6点新闻
We need it for the 6:00 news.

419
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,520
他们抓住了他
They got him.

420
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:15,740
什么  
What?

421
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,530
你真地去找你的儿子了  
Is it true you're leaving to look for your son?

422
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,200
有什么勒索信吗?
Has there been a ransom note?

423
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,000
你要从哪里开始找?
Where will you start looking?

424
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,500
他叫巴里
His name is Barry.

425
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,460
你丈夫现在在哪里  盖勒太太  
Where is your husband now, Mrs. Guiler?

426
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,510
你和那些通灵学有什么关系吗  
Are you involved in any kind of parapsychologies?

427
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,560
请转过来  转过来
Turn around, please. Turn around!

428
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:43,020
你给过警察报告  可以重复一遍吗?  
You gave the police a report. Would you mind repeating it?

429
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:50,150
大伙儿  你们现在能进来了 3655房间
Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655.

430
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,950
女士们先生们  这就是飞碟
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a flying saucer.

431
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:55,280
那就是我看见过的
That's the one I saw!

432
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,460
我发誓那是同一个 它就是我看到过的那个
I swear that's the same one! It's the one I saw!

433
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,370
这个是白蜡做的盘子  日本制造的...  
It's made of pewter, made in Japan...

434
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,680
我的孩子把这个当飞盘玩
and thrown across the lawn by one of my children.

435
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:14,730
我想指出的是  这些东西并不只是些抛光的黄铜
I wanted to point out that we're not all "polished brass" about this.

436
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,860
并且要指出  去年...  
And also point out that last year...

437
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:21,070
美国人拍了70多亿张的照片...
Americans shot more than seven billion photographs...

438
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,320
胶片以及冲印花费66亿
at a record of $6.6 billion for film equipment and processing.

439
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,360
而现在  照了那么多照片后...  
Now, with all those shutters clicking...

440
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,370
确凿的证据在哪里
where is the indisputable photographic evidence?

441
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,950
我在新闻界工作了很长的时间
I've been in the news business for a long time.

442
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:39,080
我们从来没有拍到过什么飞机坠毁的照片
We never took a picture of a plane crash as it happened...

443
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,930
或者为6点新闻拍到汽车事故什么的
or an automobile accident and get it on the 6:00 news.

444
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,430
你可以相信很多东西
There are lots of ideas that would be fun to believe in.

445
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,480
阅读他人心思...  
Mental telepathy...

446
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,230
时间旅行...
time travel...

447
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,270
不死...
immortality...

448
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,780
甚至圣诞老人
even Santa Claus.

449
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:07,580
有些无聊人  回家说"猜猜今天发生了什么"?
I know it's no fun to go home and say, "Guess what happened today?

450
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:11,490
我当时在购物中心  有一道很强的光...  
I was in the shopping center, and there was this bright light...

451
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,430
我冲了出去
and I rushed outside...

452
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,170
看到了一架飞机...
and it was an airplane."

453
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,390
对不起  先生  我也不想看到这个
Excuse me, sir. I didn't want to see this.

454
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,000
我确定我很想看到
I sure wish I had.

455
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,180
我花了15年时间...  
For 15 years I've been looking...

456
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,440
在夜空里寻找这些该死的光
for these damn silly lights in the night sky.

457
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,310
但从来没有找到过
I've never found any.

458
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,440
我很想找到  因为我相信地球以外还有生命存在
I'd like to, because I believe in life elsewhere.

459
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,180
你为什么不承认...  
Why don't you admit...

460
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,150
空军在丘陵地带进行测试
that the Air Force is conducting tests in the Foothills area?

461
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:41,040
要说是很简单
It would be easy to say yes to that.

462
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,410
但是我不想误导你们  情况不是这样
But I'm not going to mislead you. This is not the case.

463
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,990
我不知道你看到了什么
I don't know what you saw.

464
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,630
你别以为假装同意我们的话就可以愚弄我们
You can't fool us by agreeing with us.

465
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,300
不  别这样
No, come on!

466
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,540
我看过一次"大脚"
I saw Bigfoot once.

467
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:03,560
1951年  在美国加州红杉国家公园
1951. Back in Sequoia National Park.

468
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:08,020
我看到一个脚  37英寸  从后跟到脚趾
Had a foot on her, 37 inches. Heel to toe.

469
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,450
发出的声音我一辈子都不想听到第二次
Made a sound I would not want to hear twice in my life.

470
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,210
我相信我遇到了那个东西
I believe I've encountered that gentleman myself.

471
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,950
我坐在走廊上  透过屏风往外看
I was sitting on the porch, looking through the screen.

472
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,550
我看到天空里有个大白点
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

473
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,700
宇宙绑架

474
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,700
印第安纳州女士将3岁儿子
的失踪归咎于云团

475
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,700
盖勒说如果警察不继续
尽力的话她会自己找遍全州

476
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,050
它变成红色  蓝色以及绿色
It turned red and blue and green.

477
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:41,770
不明飞行物并不意味着直接威胁到国家安全
UFOs do not represent a direct physical threat to national security.

478
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,520
我们不支持他们  我们也希望你们不要
We do not support them, and we encourage you not to.

479
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,400
联系一下森林服务中心
Let's get in touch with the forest service...

480
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,320
或者我们就到野生区域去
or we'll end up in a wilderness area with vehicular traffic.

481
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,490
在怀俄明的人们非常相信圣牛这类的传说
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff for those folks in Wyoming.

482
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,460
如果这个任务顺利进行了...  
If this mission is fully developed...

483
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:50,380
傻瓜也想得出来这些人会面临什么
I get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks.

484
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,350
你的飞机是在晚上8点
Your flight will be at 20:00 hours.

485
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,230
我们有豪华轿车送您到直升飞机机场
We have a limo that'll take you to the heliport now.

486
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,310
交通工具会在那边提供
And transportation will be provided on the other end.

487
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,580
我喜欢那个发洪水的主意  
I like the flash flood idea.

488
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
你从哪里弄这些水来?
Where will you get the water?

489
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:12,080
我会告诉他们有个水库要爆炸了
We'll tell them one of the reservoirs is going to burst.

490
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,870
没有足够的水在水库里
There's not enough water in those reservoirs!

491
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,420
等一下 污染的水源影响到人们  庄稼  以及动物
Wait! Contaminated water affects people, crops, animals.

492
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,840
引来疾病
Disease.

493
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,720
-对  而且是传染的  -哪种疾病  
- Yeah, epidemic. - What kind of disease?

494
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,000
瘟疫
A plague epidemic.

495
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,350
没有人会相信瘟疫的
Nobody will believe a plague.

496
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,940
-炭疽热  -经营畜牧业的国家
- Anthrax. - Ranching country.

497
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,470
山里有很多羊
There are a lot of sheep in the hills.

498
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:32,940
好  我喜欢
Good, I like that.

499
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,450
这会制造恐慌  
It'll create a panic.

500
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,190
但这可能不会疏散每个人
But it may not evacuate everybody.

501
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:39,360
总有些傻瓜认为他们是免疫的
There's always some joker who thinks he's immune.

502
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:45,580
我需要一些真正吓人的事情  吓到300平方英里内...  
I need something so scary it'll clear 300 square miles...

503
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:48,660
一个人都没有
of every living Christian soul.

504
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,620
自己吃吧
Help yourself.

505
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,450
我讨厌这些土豆  
I hate these potatoes.

506
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,170
有一只死苍蝇在我的土豆里
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

507
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,660
没关系
It's okay.

508
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,090
那么  我猜你已经注意到了...  
Well, I guess you've noticed...

509
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,380
爸爸有些奇怪
something is a little strange with Dad.

510
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,340
但是没什么
It's okay, though.

511
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,310
我还是你们的爸爸
I'm still Dad.

512
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,410
我说不清楚我的感觉...  
I can't describe it, what I'm feeling...

513
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,990
以及我的想法
and what I'm thinking.

514
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,830
这意味着什么
This means something.

515
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,380
这很重要
This is important.

516
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,700
这样不对
That's not right.

517
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,300
这样不对
It's not right.

518
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,000
这样不对
That's not right.

519
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,650
是什么?
What is it?

520
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,520
究竟是什么?
What is it?!

521
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,660
这不公平
It's not fair.

522
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,660
告诉我
Tell me.

523
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,250
请打开门
Open the door, please.

524
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:39,530
求你了
Please.

525
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,100
开门
Open this door!

526
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:46,100
开门
Open this door!

527
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,920
我不知道自己怎么了
I don't think I know what's happening to me.

528
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:28,560
洛伊  这是家庭疗法
Look, Roy. What it is, is family therapy.

529
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,470
我的意思是我们一起去
I mean, we all go. We all talk.

530
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:35,680
没有人会落单  这可能也不是你的错
No one is singled out. Maybe it's not your fault anyway.

531
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,470
这个是防水的  还能用
It's waterproof. It still works.

532
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,610
你保证你会去
Promise me you'll go!

533
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,190
爱哭鬼 爱哭鬼
You crybaby! You crybaby!

534
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,280
-爱哭鬼  -出去
- You crybaby! - Get out of here!

535
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,700
出去
Get out!

536
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,740
来  你们
Come on, you guys.

01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,250
爱哭鬼
You crybaby!

538
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,040
-安静  -停下来
- Be quiet! - Stop it!

539
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,870
我不懂
I don't understand it!

540
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,590
-我也不懂  -出去

我们的朋友再也不打电话给我们了
None of our friends call us anymore!

551
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,960
你没了工作  也不关心

你又要对我嚷嚷了吗  
Are you going to yell at me?

561
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,800
不明飞行物
眼见为实

562
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,780

That's the last straw! Now I use my secret weapon!

586
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:31,640
我有个办法  你不能就听着吗  
I figured it out, that's all. Will you just listen?

587
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:34,820
难道你以前没有过曾经认为一些事情很疯狂  
Look, you ever look at something crazy,

588
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,900
但从另一个方面来看却并不疯狂吗
and then see it another way and it's not?

589
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,030
不没有过
No, I haven't.

590

602
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:04,590

就像沙子慢慢漏过沙漏那样...  
Like sands through the hourglass...

642
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,800
我们这样静静的生活

656
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,980

军队和国民防卫队正在协助疏散

我是个成年人  就算没有这件事情...  
I am an adult, okay? Even though there's no such thing.

660
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:52,260
那是个玩笑
It was a joke!

661
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:55,220
危险将持续72小时以上
The danger will be over within 72 hours.

662
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:58,670
罗妮  随便你要什么

This is not... We can't talk about this on the telephone.

668
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:29,800
罗妮  别挂  别
Ronnie! Don't hang up! Just don't...

669
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,930
怀俄明丹佛塔是第一个国家纪念碑
Devil's Tower, Wyoming was the first national monument...

670
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,890
1915年由西奥多・罗斯福建立
erected in this country by Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.

成千上万的避难者...  
Thousands of civilian refugees are fleeing the area...

672

spurred by rumors that the overturned tanker cars...

673
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:54,030
纷纷逃离该区域
at Walkashi Needles Junction were filled to capacity with nerve gas.

674
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:02,790
幸运的是  到目前为止并未发生任何伤亡
Fortunately, there have been no fatalities.

675
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,250
该地区将很快...
Evacuate this area, which soon...

676
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:09,170
由于强烈的由北朝南的风势
will become the "hot zone," depending on the prevailing winds.

677
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,180
这是目前为止我们可以得到的关于此次灾难事故的信息
This is as close to the disaster as we've been allowed to get.

678
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:16,100
变为危险地带
Due to a strong prevailing north-south wind.

679
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:19,100
军队工程师和怀俄明国家保卫部队...

正在努力控制泄漏毒气...

681
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:26,190
并且在方圆200米内撤离人群

683
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,870
请大家撤出该地区
Everyone, please, stay out of the area.

684
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,280
成千上万的人无家可归
Thousands of others are homeless.

685
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,910
美国军队物资局已将以下地区列为禁区

怀俄明  穆尔克罗夫特

691
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:07,610
为什么不把这些小路扩成大路  
Why aren't there fat lines instead of these thin ones?

692
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:14,080
你走错路了
You're going the wrong way!

693
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:19,380
调头  回去
Turn back around. Back this way.

694
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:21,550
你怎么了  
What's the matter with you?

695
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,390
是的  先生  对不起  先生
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.

696
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,470
就一会儿  先生
It's just a rental, officer.

697
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,600
我的错  我的错
My fault! My fault!

698
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:31,140
姓名首字母从Frank的'F'
Starting with the letter "F," as in "Frank"...

699
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,560
到Jack的'J'的人

700
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:38,150
请立即到月台上车

701
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:44,110
如果您没有早期警报系统  譬如鸟  防毒面具...  
You'll be real disappointed and sorry...

702
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:48,830
您到时候一定会失望和后悔的
if you don't have an early warning system, such as a bird, a gas mask.

703
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,170
为什么  连我的狗都有防毒面具
Why, even my dog has a gas mask.

704
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:54,050
你们总比一只狗值钱吧
And any of you folks are worth more than a dog.

705
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,290
洛伊
Roy!

706
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,100
我不管你去哪里  请站到路障后面去
I don't care where you go, just get behind the barricade!

707
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,000
为什么我们在这里  
Why are we here?

708
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:13,590
看  这是唯一去那里的路 我们穿过这些铁丝网
The only way there is across country. We'll break through the fence.

709
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:15,630
-走吧  -好  上路
- Let's go. - All right, hold on.

710
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:42,080
警察在河里搜寻我的孩子
The police dragged the river for him.

711
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,220
我告诉他们他不在河里
I told them he wasn't in the river. He wasn't.

712
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:50,130
然后他们就搜寻方圆5里内的房子...  
Then they went around to every house within five miles...

713
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:55,220
看看后院有没有  冰箱里有没有
Looking inside backyard refrigerators.

714
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,650
还我是否在附近见过什么陌生人
They asked if I'd seen any strangers in the neighbourhood.

715
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:13,020
我不相信这是真的
I don't believe it's real.

716
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,190
我不相信这是真的
I don't believe it's real!

717
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:19,910
这是真的
It's real.

718
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,300
我们去那边吧  到那里面去
Let's get down there. Get some gas and get down in there.

719
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,000
那些是什么  
What are those?

720
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,620
看  我保证整件事情是一个谎言
Look, I guarantee you. This whole thing is a put-on.

721
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:51,840
你要干什么  别碰我
What do you want? Get your hands off!

722
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,550
-你觉得怎样  -我很好
- How are you feeling? - I feel fine!

723
01:25:57,270 --> 01:26:00,610
看我的鸟就知道  根本没有什么有毒气体  都是你们在放屁
According to my birds, the bad air is from you guys farting around!

724
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,660
-带他们出去  -发生什么了  
- Move them out! - What's happening?

725
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,670
我们去哪儿  
Where are we going?

726
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:17,710
你们要带她去哪儿  
Where are you taking her?

727
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,160
等一下为什么我们不能一起走  
Hold it! Why can't we go together?

728
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,210
当心楼梯
Watch your step.

729
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:43,400
我们没什么时间  尼瑞先生  这是兰康先生
We have very little time, Mr. Neary. This is Mr. Lacombe.

730
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:47,240
我们需要你诚实  直接  中肯的回答我们
We need answers from you that are honest, direct and to the point.

731
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,570
吉利安在哪儿  
Where is Jillian?

732
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:53,990
你意识到你和你朋友都冒着很大的危险吗  
Do you realize the danger you and your friend have risked?

733
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:58,330
到这里来的时候  你们都暴露在毒气中
In coming here, you've exposed yourself to toxic gas.

734
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:00,130
我还活着
Well, I'm alive.

735
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,720
我们还在谈话
We're talking.

736
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,760
的确如此  尼瑞先生
This is true, Mr. Neary.

737
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:09,050
但是如果风从南吹而不是从北吹...  
But if the wind blew from the south instead of the north...

738
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,690
这个谈话就不会发生了
this conversation would not be taking place.

739
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,770
空气没什么问题
There's nothing wrong with the air.

740
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,860
你根据什么那样讲  
What makes you say that?

741
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:20,360
我就是知道  什么问题都没有
I just know. There's nothing wrong with it.

742
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:23,120
那你就走出去试试  证明我在撒谎
Go outside and make me a liar.

743
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:29,740
我想跟管事的人说话
I want to talk to the man in charge.

744
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,330
拉科姆先生是这里的最高管理人
Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.

745
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:34,540
他甚至不是美国人
He isn't even an American.

746
01:27:36,930 --> 01:27:39,880
尼瑞先生  你是一个艺术家或画家吗  
Mr. Neary, are you an artist or a painter?

747
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,090
不是
No.

748
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:48,810
你是不是一直听到铃声  
Have you been hearing a persistent ringing in your ears?

749
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:50,850
一种悦耳的铃声  
Almost an agreeable ringing?

750
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:52,100
没有
No.

751
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:55,690
你有头痛  偏头痛吗  
Having headaches, migraines?

752
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,000
有
Yeah.

753
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,580
眼睛和颅骨疼痛吗  
An irritation in your eyes and your sinuses?

754
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,940
疼
Yeah.

755
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,290
你有麻疹  过敏吗?  
Do you have hives? Do you have allergies?

756
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,620
脸上和身上有晒伤吗  
And burning on your face and on your body?

757
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,410
-有  你们是谁?  -看看这个
- Yes. Who are you people? - Look at this.

758
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,680
我睡房里面也有一张类似的 你们是谁  
I got one like it in my living room. Who are you?

759
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,050
Neary先生  请再回答一个问题
Monsieur Neary, please, one more question.

760
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,390
你最近有没有接触过  
Have you recently had a close encounter?

761
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:33,660
接触过一些不寻常的东西  
A close encounter with something very unusual?

762
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:38,540
你们是谁?
Who are you people?

763
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:49,210
-这些人你都不认识  -是的  除了她
- These people strangers to you? - Yeah. Except for her.

764
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:54,260
你们2个认为被迫到了这里  
And the two of you felt compelled to be here?

765
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:57,270
是的  可以那么说
Yeah, you might say that.

766
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:01,020
-但是你想要找什么  -一个答案
- But what did you expect to find? - An answer.

767
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:04,560
那不是我疯了  对吧  
That's not crazy, is it?

768
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,840
等等  等等
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

769
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:25,250
是不是为了这个?
Is that it?

770
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,670
这就是你想问我的  
Is that all you're going to ask me?

771
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,090
我有问不完的问题
I got a couple of thousand goddamn questions.

772
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:36,520
我要跟主管讲话  我要投诉
I want to speak to someone in charge. I want to lodge a complaint.

773
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,190
你们没有权利让人们发疯
You have no right to make people crazy.

774
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:43,610
你以为我调查每一件灵异新闻么
You think I investigate every Walter Cronkite story there is?

775
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:47,090
如果这仅仅是神经气体  我怎么可能知道的那么详细  
If this is just nerve gas, how come I know everything in such detail?

776
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,970
我从来没有来过这儿
I've never been here before.

777
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,850
我怎么会知道这么多的?
How come I know so much?

778
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:54,060
这里到底怎么了?
What the hell is going on around here?!

779
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,320
你们到底是谁?
Who the hell are you people?!

780
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:23,270
是那样　回答我　
Is that it?! Answer me!

781
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:27,400
我这么远到这里来不是为了乘汽车回家的
I didn't come this far to get taken on any bus ride home!

782
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:52,100
5分钟　5分钟　
Five minutes. Five!

783
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,980
我们要等几分钟
We're gonna hold for a couple of minutes.

784
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,280
你带12个人去污染排除营
You brought 12 people to the decontamination camp...

785
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:36,910
而不是去疏散中心  为什么?
instead of the evacuation centre where they belong. Why?

786
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:39,960
-因为这个意味着什么  -这个意味着什么
- Because this means something. - This means something.

787
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:45,200
这些人从全国各地赶来
These people have come from all over their country...

788
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:50,260
来到一个据说会危及他们生命的地方
to a place they've been told will endanger their lives.

789
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,590
为什么  
Why?

790
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:55,550
因为有些人可能试着捣乱
Because somebody could be trying to subvert this whole operation...

791
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:59,270
派一些宗教狂热分子潜进来
by sending in fanatics, cultists and Christ knows what all.

792
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:09,330
这是一小部分人
This is a small group of people...

793
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:14,050
他们看到了共同的东西
who have shared a vision in common.

794
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:15,840
看
Look.

795
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:22,060
我仍旧不知道他们为什么会在这儿
It's still a mystery to me why they are here.

796
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:24,300
甚至他们自己也不知道为什么
Even they do not know why.

797
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,750
别脱  你会中毒的
Don't! You'll be poisoned!

798
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:51,430
看  这里的空气没什么问题
Listen, there's nothing wrong with the air around here.

799
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:56,000
军队让我们离开  因为他们不想有目击者
The Army's getting us out because they don't want any witnesses.

800
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:59,650
如果军队不想我们在这儿  那就不关我们的事了
If the Army doesn't want us here, it's none of our business.

801
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:03,440
我想看到那个山和我画的一模一样
We wanted to see the mountain. It was a coincidence when I painted it.

802
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,280
你们可以拿下来了
You can take it off!

803
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:08,280
这里空气比洛杉矶好
The air here is better than in Los Angeles.

804
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,030
听着  你们谁想要离开?
Listen. How many of you people are for getting out of here?

805
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:22,090
我也不知道发生了什么  必须找出来
I don't know what's happening either. I must find out.

806
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:31,560
为了这些到这里来的忧虑痛苦的人们
For every one of these anxious, anguished people who've come here...

807
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:38,820
一定还有更多看到过这东西的人没能到这儿来
there must be hundreds more touched by the vision who never made it here.

808
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:42,750
因为他们从来没看过电视
Simply because they never watch the television.

809
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:47,700
或者他们看过  但从没有过精神接触
Or perhaps they watched it, but never made the psychic connection.

810
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:51,750
这是巧合  不是科学
It's a coincidence. It's not scientific.

811
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,170
听着  华尔士少校
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

812
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:58,930
这是一个社会事件
it is an event sociological.

813
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,000
等一下
Wait a minute!

814
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:38,060
-我的名字是尼瑞  -拉瑞巴特勒
- My name's Neary! - Larry Butler!

815
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,940
-你好吗?  -很好  你呢?
- How are you? - Okay! You?

816
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,990
-很好  很好  -不错
- Fine, fine! - That's good!

817
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:47,080
每个人都带着面具  直到你离开这里为止
Everybody keep their masks on until you're out of here and out of danger.

818
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:51,500
听着  我们想离开这儿  你怎么了?
Listen, we want to get out of here! What's the matter with you?

819
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,860
我要让其余的人们在一小时内下山
I'll have the rest of them off the mountain in one hour.

820
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,830
少校  我想你用红外线
Major, I want you to use infrared...

821
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,580
给我一个北方地形的照片分析
and get me a photo analysis of the northern face.

822
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:20,830
是的  先生  已经布置下去了
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.

823
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:23,130
华尔士少校  听着
Major Walsh, listen.

824
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:26,870
我也不想这样做  光这些农场的人我们已经够麻烦了
I don't like to do this. We're in enough trouble with these cattlemen.

825
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:31,000
如果你不能在晚上8点前让这些人全部撤离的话
If you can't get these folks out of the area by 20:00 hours...

826
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:33,560
就使用EZ-4
start dusting with EZ-4.

827
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:35,430
什么是EZ-4?
What's EZ-4?

828
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:39,060
是一种催眠喷雾  和我们用在家畜身上的一样
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we used with the livestock.

829
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,740
用来控制动乱
Comes out of Riot Control.

830
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:44,860
他们睡6小时醒来会头痛  就是这样了
They'll sleep for six hours and wake up with a headache, that's all.

831
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,780
我们没有选这个地方  我们没有选这些人
We didn't choose this place. We didn't choose these people.

832
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,120
他们是被邀请的
They were invited!

833
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:59,420
比起我们来他们更应该在这儿
They belong here more than we.

834
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:08,930
我应该坚持慢跑
I shouldn't have given up jogging.

835
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:12,520
看到山里那条小路了么?  我们快过去吧
See that notch in the mountain? We'll make it in no time.

836
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,310
这里又过来3架
Here come three more.

837
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,240
这个公园
The authority in this park...

838
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:22,990
被美国州政府接管了
has been superseded by the United States government.

839
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:25,870
这里过去有一条峡谷
There's a ravine leading straight up.

840
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:29,010
-爬起来比较容易  -这并不好
- It's an easier climb. - It's no good.

841
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:32,840
当你爬到顶时  有一个300尺的斜坡低头
When you get to the top, it's a 300-foot drop down. Get down!

842
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:35,630
你知道另外一边是怎样的么?
What do you think it's like on the other side?

843
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:39,470
如果你沿着这个斜坡向右走的话
There's a box canyon on the other side with ravines and trails...

844
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:41,900
另一边有峡谷和小路
if you take this incline to the right.

845
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:44,900
我从来不知道 我只画一边
I never imagined that. I only painted one side.

846
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:48,030
-我的画里也没有峡谷  -下次要用雕塑
- There was no canyon in my doodles. - Next time, sculpt.

847
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:51,160
还好有你那个要爬一个小时
You give us a lot of credit. That's an hour's climb.

848
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:52,530
来吧  我们走
Come on, let's go.

849
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,660
这个公园
The authority in this park...

850
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,180
已经被美国州立政府接管
has been superseded by the United States government.

851
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:09,930
你正在进入军事预留区
You are entering a military reservation...

852
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:12,860
受军事法管辖
and subject to military law.

853
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:14,640
报告一下
Call the bastard.

854
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:20,520
巴哈马  这里是金字塔完毕
Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over.

855
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:21,950
继续
Go ahead.

856
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,490
中转站没有报告
Nothing to report at midstation.

857
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,580
上面有成千上万的地方可以藏身
Up ahead there's thousands of places to hide.

858
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,790
如果要一小时内找到人  我们需要3倍的人力
We'll need three times the men to cover this in one hour.

859
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:35,260
让所有人从北面下来  告诉另一边的人
Get everybody off the northern face, call the other side...

860
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,220
我们准备进行喷雾
and tell them we're gonna dust.

861
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,340
低点
Get down!

862
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:09,130
你们正进入军事预留区
You are entering a military reservation...

863
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:12,970
受军事法管辖
and subject to military law.

864
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,520
拉瑞  拉瑞  来吧
Larry! Larry, come on!

865
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,210
拉瑞  别让他们看到你  低点
Larry! Don't let them see you! Get down!

866
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:45,970
他们在喷雾
They're just crop-dusting. Los Angeles!

867
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,900
不要停下
Don't stop!

868
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,390
别往后看  快点
Don't look back! Come on, come on!

869
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,610
快点  还有10英尺就到顶了
Hurry! We're only 10 feet from the top.

870
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:32,870
还有一点点我们可以到另一边滑下去
Just a few more feet! We can slide down the other side!

871
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:42,790
加油  快  我下去
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

872
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:43,920
别下来
Don't come down.

873
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:46,680
加油  来吧  加油
Come on, come on. Come on!

874
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:48,680
别担心  我们会成功的
Don't worry. We'll make it.

875
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:51,310
来吧  过来  动一下
Come on. Move it. Move your ass!

876
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:59,780
加油  加油
Come on. Come on, please.

Hold it!

879

跳跳
Jump! Jump!

880
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:28,350
-你看到那个了么?  -是的
- Do you see that? - Oh, yes.

881
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:30,180
好
Good.

882
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,770
开了么?  查一下音响系统
Is it on? Check the speaker system here.

883
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:35,620
我要所有地方都可以用
I want this up all the way.

884
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,710
你懂我意思么?
Are you reading me on this one?

885
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:42,780
这里怎样?
How about here?

先生们女士们请各自就位
Gentlemen, ladies. Take your positions, please.

890
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:09,490
这不是军事演习
This is not a drill.

891
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:13,330
我重复一遍  这不是军事演习
I repeat, this is not a drill.

892
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:18,000
能把场地的灯光调低60%么  
Could we have the lights in the arena down 60%, please?

893

894
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:28,220
我觉得今夜真美  你们说呢?
I don't think we could ask for a more beautiful evening, do you?

895
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:39,450
好  请看着天空
