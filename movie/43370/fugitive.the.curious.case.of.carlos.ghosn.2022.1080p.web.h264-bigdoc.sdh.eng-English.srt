[speaking Arabic] Hello. Good morning.

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,560
Okay, just to explain,
I'm actually an actor.

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,280
My script is based on interviews

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,960
with Mr. Ghosn's closest assistants
and PR advisors

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,880
that he's been working with for years
and who, for various reasons,

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
didn't wanna take part
in this documentary.

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,080
But for now, let's focus on the facts.

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,200
The story started in 1996 in Paris,
where Mr. Ghosn was brought in

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,960
to help save the beloved
French car company Renault.

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,760
[reporter in French] Renault has recorded
a net loss of 5,248,000,000 francs.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,560
Louis Schweitzer, its president, says

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,880
these figures have put the manufacturer
in the red for the first time in a decade.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,920
The losses are still an issue.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,680
[in English] In 1996,

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,680
I was looking for a deputy within Renault.

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,160
And I was also looking for a successor.

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,640
So I contacted Carlos Ghosn,

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,120
and he came to visit me at my office.

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,240
He was, of course, bright, brilliant.

58
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,440
[Gigandet in French] He was very direct,

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,320
very focused on the issue at hand,

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,320
and not at all the kind of person
who'd chat about the weather.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,960
No small talk, as we say in English.

62
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,360
[Schweitzer in English]
I decided on the spot that I wanted him.

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,440
[in French] In the classical French
system, there are lots of inheritors.

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,680
So people who are the nephews,
grandchildren,

65
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,240
or the children of senior officials,
ministers, or CEOs, etc.

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,960
Carlos Ghosn wasn't that at all.

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,160
Carlos Ghosn came from somewhere else,
from a very different world.

68
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,760
[Schweitzer in English] At the time,
Carlos Ghosn was Lebanese.

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
He was not French.

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,960
I told him, "I think it is a good idea

71
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,080
for you to acquire French citizenship,

72
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,000
because I think it's important
that the CEO of Renault is French."

73
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,040
[in French] He had absolutely no desire

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,360
to become part
of the French establishment,

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,000
especially not
in the Parisian environment, let's say.

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,640
I think that cost him dearly later on.

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
[intriguing music playing]

78
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,360
The other bosses didn't like him
because he wasn't in their social circle.

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,200
They'd see each other at the opera,
soccer matches, or meetings.

80
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
Carlos Ghosn never did any of that.

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,200
From the very start, he was an outsider.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
[in English] Our name in Arabic
is "Ghossone," but in French,

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
it's hard to say.

84
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,480
You really would have to say.

85
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,920
"G-H-O-S-S-O-N-E" to say it "Ghossone,"

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,680
but it's not, so…

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,400
It's "Ghosn."

88
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
Oof.

89
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,240

Very serious.

Oh, my God! This is…

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,080
[chuckling] Oof, that's a long time ago.

He was like a magician for us.

He's, I mean, really,
the brother you want to have.

100
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,600
[John Harris] The challenge of
working for Mr. Ghosn

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,240
was that his standard brief was,

102
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,880
"Send me something.
I will tell you if it's wrong."

103
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:31,080
I always describe myself as the guy
who cleans the tiger cage at the zoo.

104
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,880
You have to go in showing total respect,

105
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,920
but absolutely no fear.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
[intriguing music playing]

107
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,280
An automaker is like a vast clock
with a million moving parts.

108
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,680
Ghosn went through knob by knob.

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,960
"Adjust this way.
Adjust this way. Adjust…."

110
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,840
Thousands of knobs.

111
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,000
He did it by analyzing
each function in Renault

112
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,640
and saying, "From next year,
you have three commitments to make."

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,600
"And if you do not make these commitments,

114
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,280
I will have your nuts."

Right? As if it was, you know,

125

all about laying people off,
and shutting factories,

126

and cutting things,

but thanks to Mr. Ghosn,
within a couple of years,

Renault went from billions in debt
to a healthy profit.

Over 12.5 billion francs.

isn't particularly known

But, today, he has every reason to smile.

139
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
[Schweitzer in English] Renault,
at the time, had done a major turnaround,

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,720
but we felt that we were too small,
too dependent on Europe.

141
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,240
The conclusion was that
we should establish an alliance

142
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,920
with another car manufacturer,

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,280
and that this other car manufacturer
had to be Asian.

Either Korean or Japanese.

Renault and Nissan are creating

A shared global partnership agreement
has just been signed in Tokyo.

A global partnership in which
Renault will invest 33 billion francs

150
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,720
to acquire just over a third
of the Japanese capital.

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,920
[Schweitzer in English]
I was betting the future of Renault

came to was a car maker in total chaos.

A down-and-out Nissan,
unable to make new cars

[in English] Nissan,
at the time of the investment by Renault,

[Kelly in English] It wasn't a merger,
but it wasn't a marriage.

They controlled Nissan.

183

[in Japanese] It was a big surprise

to bring in and accept a foreign CEO.

186

Mmm. Very surprising.

[Hisao Inoue] I, too,

He was short and bald back then,

It was in the autumn of 1999

216

that the idea was to present a plan
to revive Nissan in three years.

[in Japanese] In order to make

the Nissan revival plan a success,

219
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,320
depends on how much

220
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,080
[in English] especially if we consider

221
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,840
that Nissan has
a strong base for recovery.

222
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,000
[Ando in Japanese] Ghosn was already known

223
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,080
as a cost-cutter
in his work with Michelin and Renault.

224
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
So Nissan employees

225
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,760
really feared they would lose their jobs.

226
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,320
[in English] This means
a 21,000-head-count reduction

or 14% of total employment.

they were cut off.

Especially if the complaints
were made towards Ghosn.

[in English] From a PR perspective,

to put a positive spin
on losing 21,000 jobs.

Head of Nissan because I was Carlos Ghosn.

312
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,680
I was there only because I was performing.
I was delivering growth.

313
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,120
I was delivering profit.
I was delivering cash flow.

314
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,640
I was delivering dividends.
That's our reason to be.

315
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,280
[in Japanese] Now, a meeting with Ghosn

316
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,000
always meant numbers.

317
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,800
He'd bring out a ton of figures

318
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,440
and all this data.

319
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,400
He'd speak so quickly,

320
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,280
stunning everyone into acceptance.

321
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,040
I suppose it's a sort of

322
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,000
performative magic.

323
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,320
[intriguing music playing]

324
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,000
[in English] Little bit more…

325
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,560
[Kelly] The turnaround
at Nissan was remarkable.

326
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,560
It went from an ugly lineup
to a good lineup.

327
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,440
It went from 2.5 million vehicles
to 5.7 million vehicles.

328
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,320
It went from 20 billion in debt
to 15 billion in the bank.

329
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,440
I mean, probably very few people,
maybe only Ghosn could do it.

330
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,281
[Lacombe in French] People at Nissan
said there was a "Ghosn premium."

331
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,840
And that just having Ghosn as a manager

332
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,200
made the company more valuable
in the eyes of investors.

333
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,120
That was Ghosn's position
in the automotive industry.

334
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,520
[Sproule in English] I can remember
going to Japan thinking, "Okay,

335
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,160
I'm really dealing with someone
who's very famous, very recognizable."

336
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,000
From my career to that point,

337
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,680
I hadn't sort of looked after someone
who was quite so well-known as Mr. Ghosn.

338
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,080
[engine revving]

339
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,680
Every car company has an icon.

340
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,560
Ford has the Mustang.

341
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,000
GM has the Corvette.

342
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,960
Aston Martin has the DB5.

343
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
Nissan had the GT-R.

344
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,760
Everything built up to launching the GT-R
at the Tokyo Motor Show.

345
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,640
I had written this speech,
and Simon had written a press release.

346
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,920
It was a fun one to write

347
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
because it was all about
passion and product.

348
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,920
[Harris] Because Ghosn was such a draw,

349
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,240
you had 800 journalists
all crammed around the stage.

350
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,120
And it's really uncomfortable,
and hot, and sweaty. You're all waiting.

351
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,040
[Sproule] I can remember being backstage
with Mr. Ghosn saying to me,

352
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,200
"This is a big deal," and it was.

353
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,200
- [engine revving]
- He comes roaring onto the stage!

354
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,600
- [heavy metal music playing]
- [crowd applauding]

355
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,320
[Sproule] He was always very serious,

356
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,720
but he cracked a smile
when he got out of that car.

357
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,760
I think emotions got the better of him.

358
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,320
[Harris] And he says…

359
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,640
What you hear is the roar
of Nissan's passion for performance.

360
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,640
[Harris] "What you see is
its ultimate physical expression."

361
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,040
The all-new Nissan GT-R.

362
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,840
[Harris] That was peak Ghosn.

363
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,840
That was his peak moment.

364
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,000
When I was a student at the university…

365
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,760
- Yeah.
- …my boyfriend had a GT-R.

366
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
There we go.

367
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,800
[both laughing]

368
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,360
Good memories, then. Good memories.

369
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,520
[Ando in Japanese]
He wanted to show that the GT-R

370
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,760
was like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

371
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,000
NISSAN TEST DRIVE SITE

372
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,000
[Ando] Meaning that the car
was actually very easy to drive.

373
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,520
- [on video] …almost 100 kph.
- [yelps]

374
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,280
[Ando] He let me drive it.

375
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,200
[on video] That was 200 kph… 200 kph!

376
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,200
Then suddenly at 60 kph…

377
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,200
[Ando] But what I ended up feeling then

378
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,760
was that Ghosn loved cars

379
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,160
the way little boys do.

380
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,000
[Inoue] Basically,
he loved the attention of the media.

381
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,360
[upbeat music playing]

382
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,920
[Gigandet in French] He was very famous.

383
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
[cameras clicking]

384
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,560
[Gigandet] It was a kind of Ghosn mania.
That's clear.

385
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
- [upbeat music continues]
- [crowd clamoring]

386
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,560
[in Japanese] I thought he might be scary

387
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,480
but seeing him in person, he's playful.

388
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,560
He even waved!

389
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
[Gigandet in French]
He was in all the magazines.

390
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
He was treated like a star.

391
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,040
[upbeat music continues]

392
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,880
[Ando in Japanese] He was good
at managing his own stage presence.

393
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,520
In other words, figuring out
how to make his own fan club

394
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,600
was extremely important.

395
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,080
What Ghosn did
was build a fan base within Nissan

396
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,200
and secured his place as CEO.

397
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,960
I think that's something very similar
to what a politician does.

398
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,120
- [upbeat music continues]
- [all shout]

399
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
GO IWAKI!

400
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,520
[inaudible]

401
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,800
[Gigandet in French] That was
when man gas started drawing his portrait

402
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,720
and writing his story to appear in comics.

403
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
[laughing]

404
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,320
[in English] I don't know if it's this way
or that way, how they read it, but…

405
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah, it's... I mean, come on.

406
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,920
To see your brother in a manga in Japan…

407
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,480
[Gigandet in French]
His face lent itself well to it.

408
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,280
He had thick black eyebrows.

409
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,600
[chuckling] He was very easy to draw.

410
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,720
[in English] My cousin who was there
told me once that

411
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,000
she went to the restaurant with him,

412
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,680
and when he entered the restaurant,
she said, "Nayla, it was incredible."

413
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,160
"Everybody stood up
and clapped their hands."

414
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,160
She told me, "I had the shivers.
I wish you were there to see."

415
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,800
I would have cried, of course.

416
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,880
[in Japanese] This is me and Mr. Ghosn.

417
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,200
And this one is Mr. Ghosn
with our staff and me.

418
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,000
He's so famous
that almost everyone knows him.

419
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,160
Thanks to Mr. Ghosn,

420
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,280
people found out about our restaurant

421
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,520
and we became busy.

422
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
He'd sit at this counter.

423
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,800
His favorite yakitori was

424
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
kashiwa, chicken breast.

425
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,640
[in English] When he started succeeding,

426
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,680
and I would see the manga
and all those things,

427
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,120
we're like, "Oh, my God,
you're like a fusée, like a comet going,

428
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,800
and you're gonna
still always surprise us."

429
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
[triumphant fanfare playing]

430
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,920
What he did between 1999 and 2007

431
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,080
was absolutely brilliant
and without parallel.

432
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,520
And whatever has happened since,
you can't take that away from him.

433
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,760
[in French] A small revolution
in the automotive world.

434
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,440
The Renault group is changing leaders.

435
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,720
Louis Schweitzer hands the baton
to Carlos Ghosn,

436
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
the current CEO of Nissan.

437
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm really happy to be back in France

438
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,240
to take the reins as CEO of a company
as innovative and enthusiastic as Renault.

439
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
[soft piano music playing]

440
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,600
[Schweitzer in English] What we had
agreed upon, Carlos Ghosn and myself,

441
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,360
was that Carlos would be
my successor at Renault.

442
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,800
But what we had also agreed was that
he would stop being the CEO of Nissan.

443
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
[piano music continues]

444
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
[Gigandet in French]
He could have delegated.

445
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,880
He could also have chosen someone Japanese
who was familiar with both cultures, etc.

446
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,320
He didn't do that. He didn't try.

447
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,200
[Schweitzer in English] He told me,
"I will hold both positions,

448
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,920
CEO of Renault and CEO of Nissan,
at the same time for a few months."

449
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,200
"In time for me
to find a successor at Nissan."

450
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,520
And of course I believed that.

451
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,040
And I believe
I was stupid to believe that.

452
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,400
[Gigandet in French]
He wanted to maintain control over Nissan.

453
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,360
And that was a fatal error, in my opinion,

454
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,400
for the alliance, Nissan,
Renault, and himself.

455
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,000
I think he paid dearly in the end.

456
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,920
[Sproule in English]
We were doing things literally on the fly.

457
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,680
Went to Thailand.
We were there for a couple of days.

458
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
We then went to Egypt
on the banks of the Nile.

459
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,440
Then it was on to Europe,
and then on to somewhere else.

460
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,920
And it was constantly go, go, go.

461
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,280
Yeah, and it was hard to keep up.

462
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,320
I would meet with him about once a month
on his orbiting schedule.

463
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,456
[Inoue in Japanese] They say he only spent
one week out of the month in Japan.

464
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,960
The rest was either in France or America.

465
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,560
[Lacombe in French] A CEO actively
managing two huge, global companies

466
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,840
was unheard of,
only Carlos Ghosn did that.

467
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,920
But nobody was able to make him understand
that it wasn't possible

468
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
for him to run two companies
of that size 10,000 km apart,

469
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,720
spending his whole life on planes,
being torn between the two.

470
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,760
It really isn't the best way
to understand the region, the people,

471
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,280
to see the teams
and understand what was really going on.

472
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,120
That was the start of the disconnect.

473
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,440
[Ghosn on video] In total,

474
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,760
we are going to launch
26 cars within the plan's time frame.

475
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,120
Increase our sales
by 800,000 vehicles in 2009

476
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,040
compared to 2006.

477
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,840
We are going to double our volume growth
in half the time.

478
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,720
[in Japanese] His biggest goal
was to earn a profit

479
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,680
and distribute it to the shareholders.

480
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,240
As for how he treated personnel

481
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,880
using the talented
and discarding the useless

482
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,120
I think it was very different

483
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,880
from management styles in Japan back then.

484
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,600
[in French] I think that Ghosn's proximity
to the troops, as we call them,

485
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,520
was really, really bad.

486
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,120
[Sylvie Touzet] Carlos Ghosn
decided overnight

487
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,040
that they needed to cut costs by 30%
within the Technocentre.

488
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,520
They were obliged to sign in blood,
pretty much,

489
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,040
well, obviously not,

490
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,160
but they had to sign promising
to give their heart and soul to it.

491
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,240
In early 2006,

492
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,080
my husband was working
at least 12 hours a day.

493
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,320
That also included weekends.

494
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,880
The last two months,
he was working more than 90 hours a week.

495
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,120
He regularly exceeded 100 hours.

496
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,640
So, it was really ridiculous.

497
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,120
Then, in the early afternoon,
I got a call from the police.

498
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,960
What I first thought was
that he had been in a car accident.

499
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,240
But that obviously wasn't the case.

500
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,000
My husband committed suicide
by jumping off a footbridge.

501
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:08,520
Two other people had already jumped
from the same footbridge before him.

502
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,000
One of them died,

503
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,400
and the other hurt himself seriously
and ended up in a wheelchair, paralyzed.

504
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,880
There were three suicides in four months.
That's when the press jumped on the story.

505
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,120
[reporter on recording] Is there a
collective sickness among Renault staff?

506
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,120
The question must be asked again

507
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,600
following the suicide
of a 44-year-old employee.

508
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,560
I saw him lose almost
eight kilograms in six weeks.

509
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,240
I saw him crying every night.

510
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,280
I saw him spending his nights
and weekends working.

511
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,840
I saw him no longer knowing where he was.

512
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,120
He told me he wouldn't be forgiven,
that no mistake would be forgiven.

513
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,920
It's Renault's misconduct
that won't be forgiven.

514
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,240
[Gigandet] I worked
at the Technocentre back then.

515
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,080
It really was something
we had never experienced before.

516
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,800
There was a sort of loss
of meaning, of soul,

517
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,000
and people were so desperate
that they took their own lives.

518
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,800
We would never have imagined
that could happen at Renault.

519
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,520
[Touzet] So I wrote to Carlos Ghosn.

520
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,160
I thought that he might respond
if I addressed it directly to him.

521
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,280
He didn't answer me.

522
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,920
Of course that's to be expected.

523
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,480
I don't know
if he's the sole person responsible.

524
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,960
But he is responsible
for the pressure he put on the company,

525
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,400
for what he encouraged
in terms of management methods.

526
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Car manufacturer Renault
is guilty of gross negligence.

527
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,160
Gross negligence.

528
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,920
Gross negligence in the suicide

529
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,040
[reporter] the court determined
that the car maker

530
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,520
"should have been aware of the danger."

531
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,920
The company absolutely does not
take this kind of tragedy lightly.

532
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,240
This affects us all,

533
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,480
and there will be consequences
in terms of management and the attention…

534
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,080
[Touzet] What I am realizing
by talking to you

535
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,360
is that the pain has eased,
but the anger has not.

536
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,480
I am still full of rage.

537
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,400
I am… The rage is still there.

538
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,240
The pain has eased somewhat,
but the anger has not.

539
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
[in Japanese]
In Japan, it has been compulsory

540
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,360
to disclose the amount of remuneration

541
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,400
if you are paid more than
100 million yen since 2010.

542
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,360
[in French] And that was when we realized
that Carlos Ghosn's salary

543
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,960
was seven times higher
than that of Toyota's CEO.

544
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,040
[in Japanese] Well, for someone like me…

545
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,840
When I saw the publicized income
for Carlos Ghosn,

546
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,040
I thought it was absurdly high.

547
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:23,440
It was beyond our imagination.

548
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,320
He thought he wasn't being paid enough.

549
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,840
And by that time,
Mr. Ghosn was starting to lose

550
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,360
what you may call his "superhuman powers."

551
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
[ominous music playing]

552
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,120
[in English] Once it was announced

553
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,640
that Mr. Ghosn was being paid
eight million euros by Nissan,

554
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,360
questions started to be asked
in France as well.

555
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,760
I mean, yeah, it was true

556
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,920
he was also being paid 1.2 million euros
by Renault, and for some reason,

557
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,800
some people seem to think that a total
salary of 9.2 million euros was excessive.

558
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,560
[in French] Ford said,
well, the founder of Ford said,

559
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,280
"To ensure a good atmosphere
in my company,

560
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,560
I should not be earning more than 20 times
what the basic worker makes."

561
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,360
This is "the sharing day."
What do you think of that comment?

562
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,040
To start with, you said "Ford said that,"
but Ford doesn't apply this rule.

563
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,240
The CEO of Ford is currently
the highest paid CEO in the industry.

564
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,600
And he makes three times what I do.
Just so you know.

565
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,320
[Matsumoto in Japanese] I've never
seen him excessively spend money.

566
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,720
He was quite conservative
and took care of his things.

567
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,320
As for his shirts,

568
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,000
he'd wear them until
the collar and underarms

569
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,800
turned yellow.

570
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,760
Also, this button here.

571
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,760
He gained some weight
and the neck became a bit tight,

572
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
so he asked me to

573
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,680
adjust them all by one centimeter inwards.

574
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,400
He really valued
and took care of his money.

575
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,760
Maybe that's why he was good at saving.

576
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,840
- [camera clicking]

LEBANON

578
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,080
[upbeat music continues]

579
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,080
He started to change his appearance.

580
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,840
It was always said that
he wore shoes with thicker soles

581
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,720
to make him appear taller.

582
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
[inaudible]

583
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,000
But his hair is obviously
a hair transplant.

584
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,920
[in French] We've finally achieved a
5% market share, which was the first step.

585
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,560
[in Japanese] Oh, his hair.

586
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,680
I suppose he has more hair…

587
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,240
Compared to before.

588
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,480
I don't know if he grew taller,

589
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,280
but he definitely has more hair now.

590
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,080
Then he got rid of his glasses

591
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,000
and got Lasik,

592
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,280
laser eye surgery for nearsightedness.

593
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,640
[Harris in English]
Certainly, he had a midlife crisis.

594
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,960
He divorced his first wife. His kids…

595
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,440
His kids went off to university.

596
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,560
He started to wear better suits.

597
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,320
He started to really pay attention
to his appearance,

598
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,280
and he started to have
a bit more swagger to him.

599
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,520
A securities analyst told me
that the notional value of his hour

600
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:06,320
was somewhere between
150,000 US dollars and 250,000.

601
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,680
So my key metric
was "don't waste his time."

602
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,400
No problem.
Uh, do I need to sign something?

603
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,160
[Ravinder Passi] I'd been working
at Nissan for close to seven years.

604
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,760
And an opportunity was presented to me

605
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,600
to go and work
at the global headquarters in Japan.

606
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,160
I mean, I was quite nervous anyway
because it was my first board meeting.

607
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,280
I didn't want to be late.

608
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,720
Didn't want a leaky fountain pen
or anything like that.

609
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,280
It was pretty impressive
because everyone was there in advance.

610
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,680
He came in, he sat down,
and then, you know…

611
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,400
[Ghosn] Uh, 10:30, okay.

612
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,680
Bang on time, the meeting started.

613
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,080
Who is starting today?

614
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
[man] Me.

615
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,600
- Shall I start now?
- Yeah, please. Let's go. Let's go ahead.

616
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,600
Sort of group of executives around him
that just were hanging on every word

617
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,400
like a little fan group almost,
a fan club,

618
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,640
and they do everything for him,

619
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,040
or try to do everything for him,
to please him.

620
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,480
[Hara laughs in Japanese] I wouldn't
say that Carlos Ghosn was the Emperor

621
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't know if he thought
he was God or something,

622
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,720
but no one was allowed to defy him.

623
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,760
[in French] In my eyes,
his feet no longer touched the ground.

624
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,000
He had launched into the stratosphere.

625
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,080
- [crowd cheering]
- [marching band playing]

626
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,400
He ended up being surrounded by people
who'd only tell him he was great, etc.,

627
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,720
so he lost all sense of reality.

628
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,920
That contributed to his paranoia
and his fear of conspiracies against him.

629
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,640
[Ghosn in English] All of a sudden,
a few prosecutors

630
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,080
and a bunch of executives at Nissan say,
"You know what?"

631
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,200
"This guy is a cold,
cold, greedy dictator."

632
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,440
That's what they said.
"Cold, greedy dictator."

633
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,960
[echoing] "Cold, greedy dictator."

634
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
[dark music playing]

635
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,440
[Pelata] In September 2010,

636
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,400
a few executives of Renault
received a letter saying

637
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,600
you have high-level people

638
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,560
communicating information
to a Chinese company,

639
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,440
and these people are boom, boom, boom.

640
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,600
[in French] They were accused
of selling Renault's information

641
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,600
to spies in China.

642
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,520
[Pelata in English] And then Carlos Ghosn
has a very strong reaction saying,

643
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,120
"Go to the government.
They are going to leak it."

644
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,400
"And that's going to be
big trouble in China,

645
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,920
and Nissan is big in China."

646
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,640
So I said, "No, no, no, we can't go to...
You can't go to the government."

647
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,880
"So you have to try
to convince the people to speak."

648
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,400
I organized, it was a small team,
to interview these three people.

649
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,520
I know well the three guys,
but I know very well one guy.

650
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,360
- [knock on door]
- [Pelata in French on tape] Yes? Hello.

651
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,920
[Bertrand Rochette] Hello, Patrick.

652
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,800
- [Pelata] How are you?
- [Rochette] Good.

653
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,200
[in English] So the point is
because we are good friends,

654
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,120
maybe I will be able
to convince him to speak.

655
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,440
[Pelata in French] I'm meeting
with you today

656
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,240
because we have found out
that you did something serious.

657
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,680
[Rochette] What?

658
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,680
[Pelata] We're talking
about industrial espionage.

659
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,320
I am appalled
that you would do something like this.

660
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,120
[Rochette] Sorry, I must not
have fully woken up this morning.

661
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,200
I don't understand.

662
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,680
[Pelata in English]
So I have the meeting with him,

663
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,640
and he's saying,
"What are you saying, Patrick?"

664
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,600
[chuckling] "This is…
I have nothing to do with that."

665
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,080
So I said, "Yeah, but I received a paper

666
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,560
showing that you have a bank account
in Switzerland that received that money."

667
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,920
He said, "This is not true."

668
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,120
[man in French] To be completely
transparent, some of your sidekicks

669
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,800
are being interviewed in nearby offices
as we speak.

670
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,240
They are suspected of the same offenses.

671
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,560
- You are at the center of a strategy...
- [Matthieu Tenenbaum] But it's...

672
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,576
- [man] You've done something stupid.
- [Tenenbaum] I haven't done anything.

673
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,840
[man] It was stupid, and it was an error.

674
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,680
[man] You know all this
better than I do, Michel.

675
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,520
[Michel Balthazard] I don't know anything.

676
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,640
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

677
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,440
I know nothing. I understand nothing.

678
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,720
[man] This means that your career,
your family, everything is over.

679
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,720
As soon as you leave this room,
you are also leaving Renault, Michel.

680
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,720
[Balthazard] The thing is, I don't want to
be in deep shit for something I didn't do.

681
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,440
[man] You're the one who knows, Michel.

682
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,120
That was our first day back in the office
after the holidays.

683
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
We went around the offices

684
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,080
to greet everyone
and tell them, "Happy New Year."

685
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,880
Then, first thing in the morning,
we heard a rumor

686
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,560
that three people had been fired.

687
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,600
We were soon told
we could not even talk to them

688
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,000
if they called us.

689
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,000
Where are we?

690
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,080
Is this Stalin's USSR?

691
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,160
Three Renault employees,
three high-level executives,

692
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,160
are suspected of leaking trade secrets.

693
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,920
[reporter] Three people at the heart
of the group have been fired

694
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,400
for divulging strategic information
regarding electric cars.

695
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,800
An embarrassing scandal for management.

696
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,560
I was kicked out of this company
like a dog.

697
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,200
Renault has made serious allegations,

698
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,000
which I totally refute.

699
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,400
I've not touched any money.
I do not have any foreign bank accounts.

700
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,000
I've been transparent. The investigation
is now in the hands of the law.

701
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:00,720
[in English] Everything is made worse
because Carlos Ghosn goes on the main TV.

702
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,136
[in French] Our guest tonight
is Carlos Ghosn. Good evening.

703
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,600
- Good evening.
- Thank you for joining us.

704
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,400
As you know, there are many questions
surrounding this case.

705
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,880
[in English] Advisors told him,
"Don't speak of evidence."

706
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,000
"Don't speak of evidence. Be careful."

707
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,440
[in French] Did you have
formal evidence of their culpability?

708
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,080
Listen, we have certitudes.
We wouldn't be here if we didn't.

709
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,640
What you need to know...

710
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,560
[in English] Everybody's asking,
"Where is the evidence?"

711
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,160
[Schweitzer] I knew that it was bullshit.

712
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,920
I mean, there was not a word
which was true.

713
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,840
[laughing] But we don't have evidence.

714
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,840
We just have this miserable paper

715
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,560
that has been actually
made up by a guy from Renault…

716
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,960
Who is a crook.

717
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,520
[Lacombe in French]
The accused employees were not spies,

718
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,600
they were victims of blackmail.

719
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,480
[in English] And then the bank accounts,
all that was all made up. All made up.

720
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,240
[reporter in French] Yes or no, was there
a case of industrial espionage at Renault?

721
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,000
The management team is beginning
to show its doubts.

722
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,520
We were all embarrassed.

723
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,840
Everyone was laughing at Renault,

724
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,680
at Carlos Ghosn in particular.

725
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,960
Then finally, a month later,

726
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,240
I can't quite remember the order,

727
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,600
he went back on TV.

728
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,960
- Carlos Ghosn, good evening.
- Good evening.

729
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,720
In January, you claimed to have certitudes

730
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,920
and a multitude of evidence of espionage.

731
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's now become clear
that you were wrong, to say the least.

732
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,000
What is your conclusion tonight?

733
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
Listen, I was mistaken.

734
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,560
We were mistaken.

735
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,240
And according to the conclusions
we have heard from the Paris prosecutor,

736
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,600
it seems that we were deceived.

737
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,600
[Pelata in English] Sarkozy's asking
either number one or number two

738
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,680
to resign because of that.

739
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,000
He was the president, Sarkozy,
at that time.

740
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,400
[laughs] So I am roasted.

741
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,880
I need to go.

742
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,960
I have to leave
to basically protect Carlos Ghosn.

743
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,800
[in French] There's a French expression,
"The fish rots from the head down."

744
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,840
We clearly thought
upper management had gone crazy.

745
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,520
It was really the beginning
of the end for Carlos Ghosn

746
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,000
and the alliance, I'd say.

747
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,080
[grave music playing]

748
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,360
[rousing classical music playing]

749
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,400
[Pelata in English] For me, the most
symbolic thing of this sad story

750
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,720
is what he did in Versailles.

751
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,680
Officially, it's for the 15th birthday
of the alliance between Renault-Nissan,

752
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,840
but he did it on exactly
his birthday, his 60th birthday.

753
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,600
The fact was that the Palace of Versailles
just wasn't available on any other day.

754
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,360
It was just…

755
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,600
It was pure coincidence
that this work event

756
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,360
happened on the same day
as his 60th birthday.

757
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,640
It wasn't planned.

758
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,760
I mean, he didn't have
a birthday cake or anything, you know?

759
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Like, nobody sang happy birthday.

760
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,240
But there was a Michelin-star chef
on the day, which was really cool.

761
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,320
Do you know the price of this birthday?

762
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,320
It's like 630,000 euros.

763
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,000
And he pays that
with Renault-Nissan money.

764
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,960

[Andy Palmer in English] Basically,
from the board level down,

00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,800
we used to buy our own stationery.

805
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,040
I mean, Ghosn had been brilliant in…

806
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,520
Instilling this frugality
into the company,

807
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,320
but then it didn't jive well
with what people were seeing,

808
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,160
this gulf between
the frugal behavior of the employees

809
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,440
and the apparent opulence
of Ghosn's lifestyle.

810

The Versailles parties,

811

The private airplane.

813
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,520
This lack of separation
between work and play.

814
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,080
[Saikawa] From Nissan's viewpoint,
you know,

815
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,520
it was obvious that he spent
less and less time and energy

816
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,480
for Nissan compared to before.

817
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,360
And this is an important point

818
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,200
that his leadership at Nissan
is becoming less shiny.

819
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,320
[Ghosn] To allow me
to continue to focus on Nissan

820
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,360
and on maintaining Nissan's momentum
in delivering performance,

821
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,400
I have proposed to the Nissan board,
which has agreed,

822
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,600
that Hiroto Saikawa be promoted to
the position of Chief Executive Officer.

823
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,320
Saikawa obviously became CEO
when Ghosn became Chairman.

824
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,880
The fact, though, was that Ghosn wasn't
really playing the role of Chairman.

825
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,920
He was really still very much
in control of the company.

826
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,760
[Baduel in French]
I took an interest in Renault

827
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,440
because of the behavior of its CEO.

828
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,840
You're dealing with someone
who appears to be both a cost killer,

829
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,680
so someone who reduces overhead costs,

830
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,520
who is simultaneously setting up,
overseas, out of sight of everyone,

831
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,000
namely Renault and Nissan shareholders,

832
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,840
a giant piggy bank.

833
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,040
[in English] My understanding is that, um…

834
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,280
A scheme... Oh, I've gotta be careful here.

835
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,560
- [producer] Yeah, sure.
- I've gotta be really careful.

836
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,680
But, yeah, my understanding is that
certain companies were set up,

837
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,920
and the purpose of those companies
was to invest monies in new enterprises

838
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,320
so that Nissan would have
an advantage in particular industries.

839
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,040
A lot of car companies have them now.

840
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,200
And, basically,
it's the ability to invest in start-ups

841
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,760
and in slightly riskier ventures.

842
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,480
So a whole host of money
is then put into it.

843
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:31,440
But instead of it being set up,
it being used for tech funds,

844
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,200
you have a whole host
of rotating directors, right?

845
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,840
And the money actually
being spent on different things.

846
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,000
And I was one of the directors.

847
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,080
As it was set up,

848
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,240
it was a fund that was basically managed
out of Amsterdam.

849
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,720
I think the implication is

850
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,960
deliberate obfuscation
for the purposes of…

851
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,240
Ulterior motives.

852
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,280
So making things really complicated

853
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,680
so nobody really understands
what's going on.

854
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,280
Moving people around
and doing something else.

855
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,200
[Baduel in French] He organized

856
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,760
some schemes

857
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,960
that allowed him to embezzle
huge sums of money

858
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,920
to buy villas, to buy a yacht,

859
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,160
to buy jewelry.

860
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,560
[in English] Now it transpires, allegedly,

861
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,960
that some of those funds were used
for buying houses and what have you,

862
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,400
but I have no knowledge of that.

863
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,680
[producer] So how much money
was put into the fund?

864
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
- I don't recall, I'm afraid.
- [producer] No?

865
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,120
But it wasn't small.

866
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,560
[producer] It's not
like tens of thousands.

867
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,640
No, it's millions.

868
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,600
[Baduel in French] We can estimate the
value of the properties purchased abroad

869
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:54,400
by Mr. Ghosn, under the guise of entities,

870
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,840
and the sums add up to serious amounts.

871
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,080
[Hara in Japanese] I think he
was a magician in the sense that

872
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,800
he had so much money to work with…

873
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,200
That he was a mastermind
at creating a system

874
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,240
that allowed him to do
with it what he will.

875
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,560
[producer in English] What were
the conditions that made it possible

876
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:23,600
for all these wrongdoings
to sort of not get picked up

877
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,080
before they became really serious?

878
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,040
Hmm. That's a good question.

879
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,000
And, actually, you know, I wasn't aware,

880
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,360
and quite many people are not aware.

881
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:42,800
And we have to admit that
this kind of wrongdoing was done

882
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,560
without being detected.

883
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,680
[in Japanese] I hate to say this,

884
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,360
but in my opinion,

885
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,640
the executives at Nissan
completely relied on Mr. Ghosn.

886
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,600
They were overly dependent on him.

887
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:01,800
No one criticized him,
and let him do what he wanted.

888
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,640
[Ghosn in English] The houses
all belong to Nissan and say,

889
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,280
"Oh my God, we are discovering this!
You've done it secretly!" Secretly?

890
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,960
Let me show you the documents.

891
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,200
This is a document signed

892
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,360
by the two representative directors
of Nissan, Greg Kelly and Hiroto Saikawa.

893
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,480
"Use of company,
residential accommodation."

894
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,120
"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Beirut, Lebanon."

895
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,600
So when I hear
that everybody was surprised,

896
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,920
and we were doing this hidden,
I said, "Oh, my God!"

897
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,240
But the fact is, you know,
the, uh… You know

898
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,360
I trusted Mr. Ghosn,
and I trusted his team, and…

899
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,120
So, you know, the…

900
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,840
It's not my agenda to make suspicion.

901
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,280
I'm tasked with helping the investigation
into the alleged misconduct of Ghosn.

902
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,120
And as we go along,
we see certain executives

903
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,520
have been involved
in certain elements of the misconduct.

904
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,480
As matters progressed,

905
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:15,560
we see various layer upon layer
being revealed.

906
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,080
And what I do is

907
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,600
I explain this
to the head of the audit committee,

908
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,720
so I'm blowing the whistle, so to say.

909
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,800
If the board say, "Don't worry, Rav.
We've got it under control."

910
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,560
"Thanks very much, but your concerns,
we've considered them."

911
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,400
"We don't need to do anything more."

912
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,280
It's great. All well and good.

913
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,960
I've done my job. They've done their job.

914
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,040
But that doesn't happen.
It just goes eerily silent.

915
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,680
Within a matter of three days,
I'm removed from the Ghosn investigation.

916
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,240
I'm told that after eight years
of being in Japan,

917
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,680
I have to go back home.

918
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,200
Yeah, I lose my job, in essence.

919
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,720
Then you have to think,
is the barrel rotten?

920
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,720
And if the barrel's rotten…

921
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,120
Well, it's game over then, isn't it?

922
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,800
[static buzzing]

923
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,040
[narrator] Mr. Ghosn was asked to stay on
for a few more years

924
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,200
to take the Renault-Nissan alliance
to the next step.

925
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,360
Now, most people
would call this next step a merger,

926
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,200
but Mr. Ghosn and his communication team
were very careful not to use that word.

927
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,520
[on video] Probably one of the reasons
for which I'm in this situation today

928
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,920
is because I accepted this offer

929
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,360
to continue to integrate
the two companies,

930
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,040
converge the two companies.

931
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,520
[in Japanese] However,
from Nissan's perspective,

932
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,760
I believe they concluded
that they wouldn't gain anything

933
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,280
from merging with Renault.

934
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,960
[in English] I said clearly several times
that I was against a merger.

935
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,760
I am a pro-alliance guy,
but I don't support a merger.

936
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,360
That was my position.

937
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,000
[Ghosn on video] Unfortunately,
there was no trust.

938
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,760
And some of our Japanese friends thought

939
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,480
the only way to get rid of
the influence of Renault on Nissan

940
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,120
is to get rid of me.

941
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,880
Carlos Ghosn is like a prostate exam
for the Japanese people.

942
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,440
Right now, they know it's healthy,
they know it's necessary,

943
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,600
but it's still a goddamn indignity

944
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,600
to have someone shove their hand
up your ass.

945
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,520
And, eventually, they are going to react

946
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,040
rather violently against this.

947
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,840
Well, he managed for 19 years
before they finally reacted.

948
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,000
But, boy, did they react!

949
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,000
[reporter] One of the world's
most influential businessmen

950
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,240
has been arrested in Tokyo
on suspicion of financial misconduct.

951
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,760
[reporter in Arabic] Carlos Ghosn,

952
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,040
Chairman of the Board of Directors
of Nissan, Japan…

953
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,960
[reporter in French] The emblematic CEO
of Renault-Nissan, Carlos Ghosn,

954
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,440
was arrested in Japan today.

955
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,000
[reporter in English] Nissan says it has
been investigating Ghosn for months.

956
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,840
He's accused of using company money
for personal use.

957
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,800
[on video] I came down from the airplane.
I was taken in a car.

958
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,120
I arrived to the passport.

959
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,160
They told me there's a problem
with my visa.

960
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,040
You cannot use anymore your phone,
and then I was arrested.

961
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,720
I don't understand what's going on.

962
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,440
[in Japanese] My thought was,
"So he was finally arrested."

963
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,440
[Ghosn in English] Can I at least give
a phone call to Nissan to send a lawyer?

964
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,840
But obviously I didn't know
that Nissan was behind it.

965
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,800
And it was all staged way before!
Between the prosecutor and the company.

966
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,640
[Gigandet in French] What's incredible is

967
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,920
that the TV stations in Japan
had been warned

968
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,320
that he was going to be arrested,
and they were there waiting for him.

969
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,040
[reporter in English] Shares in Nissan
and Renault are plunging.

970
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,200
I was in a big seminar of the company.
At 10:00, we go drink coffee.

971
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,200
I open my phone. Wow!

972
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,600
- [overlapping conversations]
- [reporter] Fraudulent misconduct…

973
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,400
It's clear somebody wanted him in jail.

974
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,760
[reporter] It all started
with a Nissan internal investigation

975
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,120
after a whistleblower report.

976
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,000
Carlos Ghosn's top executive, Greg Kelly,
has also been arrested.

977
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,160
[on video] It took five hours
between my arrest

978
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,080
and me finding myself
in a tiny cell in Kosuge.

979
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,560
And once you're arrested,
you're in big trouble in Japan, right?

980
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,400
You're presumed to be guilty
in many, many respects.

981
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,160
[sighs] How can I say?

982
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,800
I still have, like…
Even when I talk about it, it hurts here.

983
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,600
Like, you get stiff.

984
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,640
And we were sure

985
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,520
I was sure it was a mistake,

986
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,520
and the next day he would be out,

987
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,920
because, I mean, what can happen?

988
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,120
[on video] And I've been told
this is totally legal.

989
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,440
How can it be legal?

990
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,160
[Lacombe in French] I remember running
Japanese articles through Google Translate

991
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,480
to try and understand what was happening.

992
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,280
We started to understand things

993
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:21,080
when we saw Hiroto Saikawa's
press conference.

994
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,000
That's when we realized
something incredible was happening.

995
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,720
It was like Game of Thrones,
Nissan edition.

996
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,200
It was just totally crazy.

997
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,280
[in Japanese] We are furious…

998
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,320
And for me personally.

999
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:43,280
I feel strong disappointment.

1000
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:48,480
The problem is one person
having so much power.

1001
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,960
It's the dark side of the Ghosn era
that lasted many years.

1002
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:01,480
[Saikawa in English] Some people again
said I, Saikawa, betrayed Carlos Ghosn,

1003
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,600
but I didn't at all.

1004
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,560
It was him that betrayed my trust.

1005
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,640
This is what I want to say.

1006
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,720
I didn't sign up for this.

1007
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,680
I signed up for being a lawyer
for a car company.

1008
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,120
I didn't sign up to be involved

1009
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,960
in some strange, international conspiracy

1010
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,640
or wrongdoing, especially in Japan.

1011

[helicopter whirring]

In Japan, among those who are…

1013

Charged with a crime,

1014
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,880
99% of them are found guilty.

1015
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,520
[Ghosn in English on video]
The legitimacy of a justice system

1016
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,560
should not rest on its conviction rate,

1017
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:01,280
but instead on the confidence
that it searches for an honest truth

1018
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,440
and dispenses fair and just outcomes.

1019
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,840
[in Japanese]
In Japan, if someone is arrested…

1020
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,480
That person's life is over.

1021
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,200
[in English on video] 130 days in prison,
solitary confinement,

1024
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,240
Tried to ask to have more. They said no.

1025
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,280
Interrogated day and night.

1026
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,720
It can happen in the morning,
in the afternoon, at night,

1027
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,040
up to eight hours
without the presence of a lawyer.

1028
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,640
So I felt, from the beginning,

1029
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,360
that there was no interest
in finding the truth.

[Takano in Japanese] I met him for the
very first time on February 14th, 2019.

1032
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,480
It was Valentine's Day.

1033
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:01,720
By that time, he had been
in custody for three months already.

1034
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,120
Mr. Ghosn was questioned every day
after he was arrested.

1035
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,160
The questionings are not
the kind of conversations

1036
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,320
one might have over tea and cake.

1037
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,440
[Ghosn in English on video] "It will get
worse for you if you don't just confess,"

1038
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,240
the prosecutor told me repeatedly.

"If you don't confess,
not only are we gonna go after you,

we're gonna go after your family."

1041
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,440
[in Japanese] Lawyers in Japan
often refer to this arrangement

1042
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,240
as the "hostage justice."

1043
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,640
It's a world where time moves backwards.

1044
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:46,280
A character named the White Queen
appears in Alice in Wonderland.

1045
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,560
And the White Queen's world
moves backwards in time.

1046
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,840
That's exactly how
a trial is held in Japan.

1047
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,680
Punishment comes first.

1048

Then comes the trial.

1049

Then they're judged at the very end.

1050
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,160
So time really moves backwards.

that I have served for 17 years.

1053
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,040
Yeah. In the end, there's one thing
about the knives being out for you

1054
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,680
because nobody wants you
in that job anymore,

Really, I would say
we were kind of scared.

I would tell my cousin, "Come on!"

[Takano in Japanese]
After many negotiations with the court,

1070
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:41,200
he was released
on bail of one billion yen.

1071
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,120
At the time, we negotiated
with the detention house

1072
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,640
so we could get him out the back door.

1073
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,560
But for some reason,
Tokyo Detention House didn't approve it.

1074
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,520
We dressed up Mr. Carlos Ghosn
in a Japanese workman's outfit.

1075
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,720
Then we loaded him
onto a small truck upon his release.

1076
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,080
[Ando] His disguise

1077
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,440
was just so pitiful…

1078
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,920
The fact that his disguise was
basically visible proof that he was

1079
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,920
not on the side of justice,

1080
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,160
made me feel extremely sad.

1081

[dark music continues]

[Fumiaki Kurioka]
You hardly ever get a chance to

1083
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:05,600
chase a foreigner,
let alone someone famous like Ghosn.

1084
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,680
I never dreamt I'd do such a thing.

1085
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
After he was released on bail,

1086
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:16,840
my job as a tabloid journalist
was to follow his every move.

1087
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,920
- [intriguing music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

1088
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,360
[Kurioka] It was absolute chaos back then.

1089
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,160
It was basically a media scrum.

1090
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,240
- [reporters clamoring]
- [car honking]

1091
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,840
[Kurioka] We chronicled
his daily activities for a whole year,

1092
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,080
but we never saw him drive a Nissan.

1093
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,160

1094

[camera clicking]

1096
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,560
[Kurioka] He knew
that he was constantly being watched.

1097
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,880
[Takano] There was a surveillance camera

1098
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,880
installed at the entrance of his house.

1099
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,480
So anyone that visited him,
the exact time he left the house,

1100
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,560
were all recorded as footage.

1101
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,640
[intriguing music continues]

1102
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,200
[Kurioka] The mastermind
of the escape was Michael Taylor,

1103
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,880
a former American special forces agent

1104
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,200
who must have organized a network of
ex-combat and private security personnel

1105
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,400
to help him research
the elaborate escape plan.

1106
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:38,400
I think he was already planning his escape

1107
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:44,440
when he was released on bail.

1108
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,000
That's what I believe.

1109
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:51,520
I heard that whenever he met with anyone,

1110
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,720
he usually met them at the Grand Hyatt.

1111
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,200
Sometimes he went by car,

1112
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,400
and sometimes he walked.

1113
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,320
It's not an exaggeration to say
he went out every day.

1114
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:19,880
So the pictures and videos
all started to look the same.

1115
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,480
He wanted the investigators and guards

1116
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,680
to think going to the Grand Hyatt
was part of his daily routine

1117
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,760
and that he wasn't going
for any special reason.

1118
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,480
I'm guessing that he even knew

1119
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,640
where all the cameras were placed.

1120
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,280
[suspenseful music playing]

1121
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,760
[Takano] At the time, he wasn't allowed

1122
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,480
to communicate with anyone
involved in the case.

1123
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,880
So, according
to the final bail conditions,

1124
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,080
Carlos Ghosn

1125
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,200
couldn't meet, talk,
or even send letters to his wife Carol.

1126
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,000
That condition was added.

1127
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,720
I found it extremely difficult
to have to inform him

1128
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,200
of this condition.

1129
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,280
[dark music playing]

1130
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,720
[reporters clamoring]

1131
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,600
[reporter in English] Mr. Ghosn,
do you have a message

1132
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,920
for the people supporting you?

1133
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,320
[in French] We ask the president
to put pressure on the Japanese government

1134
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,320
to respect human rights
and the right to a defense

1135
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,000
or to let Carlos be tried in France.

1136
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,080
[interviewer] You want him
to be tried in France?

1137
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,560
I think so, because we can see
that he won't get a fair trial in Japan.

1138
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,200
[in Japanese]
No matter how many times we tried,

1139
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,320
the date of the trial was never settled.

1140
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,040
Faced with this situation,

1141
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,200
Ghosn wondered how long
he'd have to be in Japan.

1142
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,720
He started asking
when the trial would happen

1143
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,120
and whether he would be able

1144
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,240
to receive a fair trial.

1145
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,880
He began to ask this often.

1146
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:35,320
[in English] All the signs that there was
no way I was going to be treated fairly.

1147
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,680
It's not very difficult
to come to the conclusion

1148
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,720
you're gonna die in Japan
or you're gonna have to get out.

1149
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,080
[reporter in Arabic]
After he got arrested,

1150
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:47,440
posters appeared in Beirut supporting
the Lebanese businessman Carlos Ghosn.

1151
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,360
[in French] You can't
understand Carlos Ghosn,

1152
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,720
his motivation, what drives him,
this desire to succeed,

1153
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,440
this desire to win
and to show that he's the best,

1154
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,920
without understanding
the pain of his childhood.

1155
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,280
We found an article
about Father Boulos Massaad,

1156
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,920
who was found dead
one evening in April 1960.

1157
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,880
- [gun firing]
- [Lacombe] He was shot twice.

1158
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,320
And near the scene the crime

1159
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,120
a Peugeot belonging
to Carlos Ghosn's father was seen.

1160
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,880
What we came to understand

1161
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:46,400
is that the priest, Boulos Massaad,
was being used by George Ghosn

1162
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,320
to smuggle diamonds from Africa.

1163
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,080
He was tried and sentenced to death.

1164
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,720
Then in the mid-1970s,
civil war had just broken out in Lebanon.

1165
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,240
He managed to escape from prison
and found refuge in Brazil.

1166
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,200
You can imagine,

1167
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,680
spending his childhood with his father
in prison accused of murder,

1168
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:17,440
even sentenced to death
for murdering a priest,

1169
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,320
would be really hard.

1170
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,160
Carlos Ghosn created his own legend
his whole life.

1171

ONE LAST SECRET

1172
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:33,320
[Lacombe] The account of a life
that wasn't exactly the one he lived.

1173
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,840
So he probably felt this need

1174
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,440
to show all the people he grew up with,

1175
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,240
to say to them, "Look how successful
I've become in spite of my background,

1176
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,480
in spite of my father's story,
of my life."

1177
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,400
"There you go.
I've achieved great things."

1178
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,040
[Matsumoto in Japanese] I saw him
for the last time on the 26th.

1179
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,160
He came up to me and said,

1180
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:05,280
"Keiko…"
[in English] "I'm going to pay you."

1181
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,480
[in Japanese] I was surprised because
he didn't have to pay me yet.

1182
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,040
But he asked for all my receipts

1183
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,560
and paid me.

1184
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:20,600
He told me to choose any wine I wanted

1185
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,080
and he gifted me two bottles.

1186
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,640
He asked to take a picture together.

1187
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,560
He'd never asked before,
so it made me very happy.

1188
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,240
He even gave me a hug.

1189
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,280
He's not usually
the type of person who gives hugs.

1190
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,440
So I think he gave me a hug because

1191
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,240
he was going to run.

1192
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,760
He knew it was the last time,

1193
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:50,000
so he gave me the gift, the hug,
and even took a picture with me.

1194
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,160
It made me happy.

flew into Kansai International Airport
from Dubai on a private jet.

[Ghosn in English]
Japanese people are very organized.

1201
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,920
When you are organized,
you're predictable.

1202

When you are predictable,
it's your weakness.

1203

[Kurioka in Japanese] Carlos Ghosn
left his house at 2:30 p.m. on the 29th.

1204
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,800
[in Arabic] I left the house
wearing normal clothes.

1205
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,600

they would recognize me.

with his three accomplices at the hotel.

[Ghosn in Arabic] I left the hotel
to go to the airport,

which means you have
to take a taxi, then the train.

or three hours surrounded by people.

01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,600
You mustn't draw attention.

1218

There was no way I could walk
through the airport with my face.

01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,600
[intriguing music playing]

1220
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:24,760
[Kurioka in Japanese] At Shin-Osaka,
they took another taxi.

1221
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,360
From there…

1222
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,440
They headed to the hotel
that Michael Taylor had reserved,

1223
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,920
which is connected to
Kansai International Airport.

1224
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,680
[intriguing music continues]

1225
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,976
[Ghosn in Lebanese] I had to get
on the plane without anyone seeing me.

1226
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,120
How do you get on a plane
without being seen? The check-in baggage.

1227
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,000
[in English] Time to go home.

1228
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,600
[Kurioka in Japanese] From that moment on,

1229
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,560
Carlos Ghosn did not appear
on any CCTV cameras.

1230
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,040
You can say he disappeared.

1231
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,280
[suspenseful music playing]

1232
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,640
[Kurioka] When they left the hotel,

1233
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,400
it was around 10:00 p.m.,

1234
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,280
9:57 p.m. to be precise.

1235
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:02,080
[Ghosn in Lebanese] The issue
was to get on the plane, inside a box,

1236
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,440
without going through the X-ray.

1237
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,520
We decided Osaka would be the right place.

1238
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,920
And it also had to be done
at the end of the year.

1239
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,680
Why? Because people go on holiday then.

1240
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:22,200
So permanent staff are away,
and they're replaced by temporary staff.

1241
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,880
Temporary staff aren't
as knowledgeable on procedures.

1242
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
[suspenseful music continues]

- [indistinct muffled chatter]

1245
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:52,640
[worker 1 in Japanese] It took
about four to five people including myself

1246
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,600
to lift the large box.

1247
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
[laughs] One of the staff members joked,

1248
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:04,000
"Maybe there's a
beautiful young woman in the box."

1249
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,000
[workers grunt]

1250
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,560
[worker 2] Mr. Taylor told me

1251
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:16,680
they were violinists,

1252
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,720
[chuckles]
but I did feel that it was strange.

1253
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:27,400
The two men had a guitar case
instead of a violin case.

1254
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,360
[dramatic music playing]

1255
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,360

[Ghosn breathing]

1257
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:46,520
[Kurioka] The crucial stage
was getting through security.

1258
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,080
This was the moment
Ghosn was most likely to be discovered.

1259
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:00,160
It was vital the box
did not go through the X-ray machine.

1260
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,520
[indistinct chatter]

1261
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,680
[Ghosn breathing]

1262
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,760
[Ghosn in Lebanese] When you are
at a point in your life

1263
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,320
[in French] when it's all or nothing

1264
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:19,440
[in English] I need
to be totally concentrated

1265
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,360
[in Lebanese] to know how to react
in case something happens.

1266
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,560
[in English] You are living in the moment,
intensely in the moment.

1267
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,560
So maybe we'll just shoot on...

1268
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,960
Oh, no!
No, it's a delicate musical instrument.

1269
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,280
It can't go through the scanner.
I'm sure you understand.

1270
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,520
It's acoustically perfect.

1271
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,240
[continues muffled]
We have a couple of performances,

1272
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,880
so we have to take it on tour.

1273
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,000
We can open it, but we cannot lift it.
This is…

1274
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,760
[suspenseful music playing]

1275
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,360
[tense music playing]

1276
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,640
[Ghosn breathing]

1277
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,400
[Ghosn] The 30 minutes
waiting in the box in the plane,

1278
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,040
waiting for the plane to take off,

1279
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:46,800
were probably the longest period of wait
I've ever experienced in my life.

1280
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,480
[plane preparing for takeoff]

1281
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,280
[upbeat music playing]

1282
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,080
[Ghosn] It was bold.

1283
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,960
It was gutsy, but it worked.

1284
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,280
[music fades]

1285
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,160
[reporter 1] The ousted
Renault-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn

1286
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,600
has fled house arrest in Tokyo.

1287
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,880
[reporter 2] He fled Japan while awaiting
trial on financial misconduct charges.

1288
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,080
[reporter 3 in Arabic] The surprising,
exciting events in Carlos Ghosn's story…

1289
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,640
[reporter 4 in English] We have the latest
on the former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn,

1290
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,280
who's somehow fleeing Japan
while awaiting trial…

1291
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,080
Thank God. Thank God it worked.

1292
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,960
It's like the energy came back, you know?

1293
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,040
It's like putting some electroshock
on you, and the nurse wakes up,

1294
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,720
and the thing,
and I was telling my husband,

1295
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,840
"Oh, my God! He's in Lebanon!
He's in Lebanon! My God."

1296
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:08,320
"It's finished.
The nightmare is finished."

1297
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,160
Hopefully, you know.

1298
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,600
[crying in Japanese] I was happy for him
and wanted to cheer for him.

1299
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,480
He could finally see his family.

1300
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,800
I was truly happy for him.

1301
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,880
I shed tears of joy for him.

1302
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,640
But at the same time, I was sad.

1303
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,160
But I think it was tears of joy.

1304
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,360
[reporter 1 in English] Former Nissan
Chairman Carlos Ghosn is now in Lebanon,

1305
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,400
issuing a statement saying quote,

1306
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,240
"I am now in Lebanon
and will no longer be held hostage

1307
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,640
by a rigged Japanese justice system,

1308
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,360
where guilt is presumed"

1309
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,800
[reporter 2] "discrimination is rampant,
and basic human rights are denied."

1310
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,880
We'll be having more of that story…

1311
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,960
[dark music playing]

1312
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,760
[Ghosn] Today is
a very important day for me.

1313
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,920
One that I have looked forward to
every single day

1314
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,960
- since this nightmare began.
- Mmm.

1315
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:18,280
The fact is that Mr. Ghosn
escaped before he went to trial.

1316
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:24,240
So, until now, nobody knows for sure
if he did anything actually illegal.

1317
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,800
[in Japanese] I judged that
the evidence was not strong enough

1318
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,800
to find him guilty.

1319
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,240
If he really stands
on the side of justice,

1320
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,840
why did he have to go so far

1321
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:41,240
as to hide in
a miserable black box to flee?

1322
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:44,400
I feel quite disappointed.

1323
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,960
[in French] Now he is stuck forever.

1324
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:55,360
And he's lost all his power,
lost everything he loved.

1325
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,480
He's become the naked king,
completely naked.

1326
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,400
[dark music continues]

1327
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,200
[in English] I'm ready to stay
a long time in Lebanon,

1328
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,400
but please do not consider
that I'll just accept this as it is.

1329
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,280
I'm gonna fight
because I have to clear my name,

1330
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:28,080
and this is something
which is extremely important to me.

1331
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:33,920
I can't accept the fact
that fabricating stories

1332
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,480
and lying about something
at such a scale can win or can prevail.

1333
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,120
I can't accept it,
particularly as this is my story.

1334
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
