1
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,159
Its true that the Hittites army has 60,000 troops camped outside Kadesh, whats less clear is why

2
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,159
The Heittites had tried to cross the border, what else have you found out?

3
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,159
they are anticipating an invasion by us,

4
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,159
They think we are preparing an attack

5
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:58,159
But i dont want to do, and wont do is sit here and wait until the Hittites armies are outside our palace walls

6
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,159
What do the entails say?, its doesnt say anything, they imply

7
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:22,159
And thats open to interpretation, so interpret them if we will or wont do an pre emptive attack, is that a yes or no?

8
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,159
And its not clear

9
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:42,159
But something else is, in a battle a leader will be saved, and his saviour will someday lead

10
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:52,159
And does the entrails say that we will abandon reason and be guided by yours?

11
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:08,159
Great Gods, Pharaoh drinks in your name and pray for victory over the Hittites and delivery

12
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:17,159
Your first order of business when the time comes, you retire her, i will, but i dont know why my father wont

13
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:29,159
But just in case, if you see me in any real danger, ride the other way...im serious

14
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,159
When i look at you i still see the two boys who grew up together close as brothers

15
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,159
If for any reason you ever forget that, that these will remind you

16
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,159
Small enough to fit in the horse pack and not so long that you will trip over

17
00:03:49,159 --> 00:04:02,159
This is yours, you've got mine, thats right, thats how i want it, you have each others, to keep each other safe. Promise me you will do that, always

18
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:43,159
(( Discussing about battle tacticts to leave Moses out of danger ))

19
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,159
We should concentrate our strengh to the second

20
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,159
You should concentrate yours and fight, leave the rest to me

(( Warning about the Egyptians coming to attack ))

22

Take Ramsees..Go!

23
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:22,159
Moses, what happened out there?, nothing. I asked the commanders the same thing, they too lied, and im tired of it

24
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:35,159
He thinks something happened, but it didnt, meaning?, the high priestess, the prophecy, she said she couldnt see who would win, the other

25
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:45,159
You saved my sons life?, yes

26
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:54,159
Sit, thank you is most efficient, thank you

27
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:02,159
I know you dont believe in the priestess's prophecies...but i do believe, and i respect that

28
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:10,159
But this doesnt make any sense, because you are not my blood

29
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:21,159
Its true you cant succeed me, not the usual way, not in anyway

30
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:32,159
The people trust you more than him to lead

31
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:57,159
The hettites chariot troops crash through our defense and began its attack, i found myself surrounded by the enemy..no soldier, no shield bearer facing a desperate fight for my life.
Only with help of the Gods did i defeat our attackers and rejoin our divisions, stop there!

32
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,159
Anything you like to rephrase? No,

33
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,159
shall i go on, no for the rest its fine, whats next?

34
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:21,159
a situation, the slaves, Ramsees..what?...go up there meet with the vice roy, look around and make a report

35
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:31,159
Me?, it will be yours someday, to get interested in....what else?

36
00:13:39,159 --> 00:14:03,159
I'll go see the vice roy, no, i'll do it, but its beneath you?, its beneath any general, i'll do it, Ramsees can we forget what happened on the battlefield?, if our positions have been reversed i would have saved
your life 2 weeks ago, i know

37
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:22,159
Welcome to Python, you'll get used to this land

38
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:50,159
The vice roy seems to be enjoying a good share of his resources, this is not a job everyone wants to do my lord, a certain degree of comfort is necessary to keep up with spirits

39
00:15:53,159 --> 00:16:14,159
You know what the problem is?, people live too long these days, every year the death rate lacks further behind than the birth right..and these people reproduce like its a sport, is this a problem in growing
work force?, oh no..of course not, its good for production, of course it is but only to a point.

40
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:25,159
And that population wants you dead...yes its a problem, and so i deploy more troops to maintain it

41
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:38,159
You start slaughtering people for no reason other than this theory, you will provoke the very thing you say, fine then give me the troops

42
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:58,159
Lets go down and talk to them, why on earth?, you are worried about sedition, lets find out if that worry is real, by you talking?, by looking at them when im talking to them, you can tell a lot about somebody..looking them in the
eye

43
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:18,159
Well let me tell you something about hebrews, they are conniving combative people, do you know what Israelite means in their own language?, he who fights with God, he who wrestles with God, there is a difference

44
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:30,159
Look im not as educated as you, but i have to deal with them everyday, i know what im talking about, you dont have to come, ill go down myself

45
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:22,159
Why is he being punished?, persistent follow maker my lord, why is he smiling?, he says he feels no pain my lord, they why whip him?

46
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:40,159
You were not gathered up at random, i asked to see the elders

47
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:49,159
Come on what do you pray for?, we pray to see canaan again, canaan again? you'll never see it

48
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:57,159
ive seen canaan, ive seen that its inhabited by tribes fiercer than the egypt's military so you want me returning to it or if you do from?

49
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:07,159
God says otherwise, which God?, your God?, The God of Abraham?, the God that said that you are special, that you are chosen, let me tell you...come here, come, come here

50
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,159
He is wrong

51
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:29,159
I can see that you are unconvinced, and thats a problem, this beliefs are from fanatics and they set out sedition when/and they still have revolution and it all starts with the elders, whats your name?, whats yours?

52
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,159
I'll tell you, im Moses, im son of (***)

53
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,159
Record this ones name and the rest of them and bring in the next group

54
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:50,159
My name is (***)

55
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:10,159
They sent me out to tell you (to meet at one of the Israelites house)

56
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,159
I see you've survived (meeting with the Israelites), sorry to make you wait again, im not waiting

57
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,159
How was your trip to the quary?, fine, you saw what im up against, hmm..

58
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:45,159
Tell me is there anymore of my records i could get for you before you leave?, you can tell me has all of this been reported to memphis? was it approved? do you have a writing?, of course...on the record,
then you dont mind if i check

59
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:55,159
Of course i dont mind, but i dont understand whats gone wrong?, have i done something to displease you? and if so is there anyway i could please you?

60
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,159
You could stop living like a king, you are no one

61
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,159
To a land filled with milk and honey

62
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:24,159
Can they at least wait outside? we are not dangerous, wait by the horses

63
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:39,159
Do you believe in conincidence?, as much as anything else, i dont think this is one, what is it?, you..coming to python..why did you come?, business

64
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,159
Sit

65
00:22:51,159 --> 00:23:03,159
Who is your father?, i know you dont know his name, you were told he is a general in pharaoh's army, unnamed by your mother, i can see this is making you uncomfortable

66
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,159
This will interest you, there is no general

67
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:17,159
Your mother whom you called mother has no children, you were born of the slaves, dont go, dont go..

68
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:33,159
Its better for you that i do, im leaving, if you leave now, just come back because you know something is wrong, you have always felt it....please

69
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,159
Everybody out, out..

70
00:23:49,159 --> 00:24:03,159
The year of your birth, there was a prophecy, that our leader would be born to liberate us from our bondage, so there was an order from memphis to kill every first born hebrew boy

71
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:18,159
Your parents didnt wait for that to happen, any chance of your survival was barely no chance, they handed you to your sister, she took you in a basket to the banks of the river

72
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:42,159
And she floated you to where ramsees daughter was bathing, she took you and your sister Miriam as a maid who raised you as her own, she probably loved you but she never told you or anyone else the truth..you are Hebrew..true

73
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:54,159
The truth is its only a story, you people are only good at story telling

74
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,159
You...slave!

75
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,159
You!!

76
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:25,159
Do you expect a reward for this information?, our reward is to be in service to you, that said if it were some token you have in mind or beyond that?..you wont refuse it, why am i to accept, what if im going to kill you, that
would be sufficient payment, you people

77
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,159
Please..leave

78
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:30,159
How did it go?, we'll talk about that another time, we can talk about it now,

79
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,159
Sit

80
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:56,159
I took a thorough look at the city records, the man is clearly a thief,

81
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:11,159
Whats wrong Moses?, you are sick, something else is troubling you, i can tell, no..nothing is

82
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:40,159
May you be rejuvinated and protected by the gods every moment of your eternal life

83
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,159
To your left, no your left, good

84
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:56,159
It is..tall, monuments are monuments for a reason its inspiring, inspire what in this case? in this and in every case..power

85
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:10,159
Say it out loud whatever it is, the vice roy of python is outside (***) i dont know if we should deal with this, bring him in..

86
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:39,159
if you came here to beg for  the king's forgiveness it wont work, arrest him, ah..wait, please, may i at least respond?, i beg you, its in your interest, then make it short, i will, to the king alone

87
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,159
My advise is that he and the other generals also leave the room,

88
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:57,159
Great, thats real nice, well you are not his advisor, oh thats right..you are, thats right

89
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,159
Moses..Moses..

90
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,159
Everybody but the vice roy..out

91
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,159
Terrible news..

92
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,159
There you are

93
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:46,159
So..the vice roy..you didnt arrest him, you didnt take your chief's advices?, advice?

94
00:31:48,159 --> 00:32:03,159
Oh he cant..uhh..(***) one who survived the attack and i told him i did not care, and then he told me the most unbelievable story

95
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:15,159
He told me my sources were unreliable, he admitted that there were Hebrew spies, you know what im talking about

96
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:26,159
And what do you make of it?, i think its offensive and i think its ridiculous, yes..you of all people are hebrew

97
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,159
How could i believe such a story?

98
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:44,159
What if i take the chance of believing him?..what am i to do?

99
00:32:51,159 --> 00:33:04,159
Mother..the man is a thief, my son discovers this, not you, and he reports it to your father who would have hand this thief if he hadnt been dying himself, you believe his nonsense

100
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:17,159
All i want to know is if its true, i didnt ask for (***), you talk about this any longer we are dignified and i wont do that, answer the question..yes or no? was i talking to you?

101
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,159
Bring her in..bring her in..now!

102
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,159
Miriam..come sit..sit down

103
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:37,159
Now..im going to ask you some questions and i want you to answer me truthfully

104
00:33:39,159 --> 00:34:00,159
How did you know Moses?, you know how i know him, i helped raised you both, so you are not his sister then?, of course not, and you are not a Hebrew?, no..

105
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,159
Put your arm on the table

106
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:16,159
Ramsees..dont be stupid, Ramsees!, im not talking to you, im talking to her

107
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,159
Your whole arm on the table, thank you

108
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:40,159
Ramsees..dont take this any further, dont take this any further or what?, do not take this any further, get your hand off or i'll use it..now

109
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,159
Perhaps you would like to answer the question?

110
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:00,159
Miriam im going to ask you again and if your answer is again no..i apologize for what happens next

111
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,159
Are you his sister?

112
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,159
No

113
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,159
Yes!!....Yes!!

114
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:09,159
You dont need a reason to kill him, but you have one, this was treason, i wasnt treasoning, he just admitted he knew, that wasnt an admission, he simply didnt want her arm chopped off

115
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:25,159
I saw it in his eyes, he doesnt (***) believe the story, i dont want to believe it, you want to believe it because its up (***) to get rid of him, i didnt say exiled..i said dead

116
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,159
That im sure will follow..where he is going

117
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:46,159
Allow me to talk to my mother, yes sir..yes

118
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,159
Come Miriam

119
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:12,159
it isnt every man who would protect his servant who is nothing more to him than that

120
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:16,159
Certainly no one else in this family including me

121
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,159
I wouldnt have said what you wanted to hear

122
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,159
And neither would she

123
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,159
thats how much we love you

124
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:59,159
Its not true, yes its true, you were wearing this when i brought you to the river, i took it of for obvious reasons, (***) the connection between you and all of them

125
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:10,159
Your sister saved your life, now you have saved hers

126
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,159
Miriam

127
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,159
Sorry sir

128
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:57,159
I have nothing to steal, my horse is dead, we are not here for your horse..Moses

129
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:28,159
What are you doing?, dont stop keep working, you..get water for our goats

130
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:42,159
You, wait your turn

131
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,159
Move your animals away from the well

132
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,159
Where are you from?, west from here

133
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:42,159
Where are you going?, east

134
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:47,159
What did you do?, what do you mean?

135
00:45:50,159 --> 00:46:03,159
You comitted some crime?, i respect your daughters inviting me for some food, i did not know that there would be an interrogation, im sorry..im just curious

136
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:18,159
You are welcome to get cleaned up before dinner if that appeals to you, you can stay a night if you want, before continuing on..to where ever it is, thank you

137
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:47,159
Describe to me what its like where you come from

138
00:46:49,159 --> 00:47:00,159
Its..i wouldnt say civilized..because i wouldnt want to offend the villages here, theres more than..sheep and goat there

139
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,159
There is more here than that, really?..where?

140
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:15,159
Im sorry that was rude..that was rude, im not ignorant just because i live here, i can see that

141
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:27,159
I can tell you one thing..this is by far the nicest place..between here and there

142
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:35,159
And so you are leaving?, of course..there is nothing here for someone like me

143
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:42,159
When?..today?

144
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:47,159
Remember this moment in time, for after these vows, you shall say to the world, this is my husband..this is my wife

145
00:48:52,159 --> 00:49:00,159
(( Exchanging Vows ))

146
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,159
What makes you happy?

147
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:27,159
You know

148
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,159
Whats the most important thing in your life?

149
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:38,159
You are

150
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,159
Where would you rather be?, no where

151
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:49,159
And when would you leave me?, never

152
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:53,159
Proceed

153
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:55,159
I said per se..i dont want to discuss my tomb per se

154
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:05,159
I want to discuss why you want to discuss it before time, respectfully it should have been your first construction

155
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:20,159
Is there a problem with the palace?, its gone down, it wont be long now, set up months ago meanwhile im asked for my burial

156
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:28,159
Get it done!..faster!, do i have to kill someone?

157
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:46,159
Just aim a little higher,

158
00:51:49,159 --> 00:50:51,159
Almost

159
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,159
Have you ever been to the top?

160
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:13,159
No, would you like to?, mother says its forbidden, by who?, our God

161
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:26,159
Our God?..stops us from climbing mountains?, not every mountain, just that one, its God's mountain

162
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,159
You are not fierce with him

163
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:57,159
Im not trying to, is it good for our boy to grow up living in nothing?, its bad to God believing in yourself

164
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:09,159
Its my faith, i know, and its his too, i understand, he can make up his mind when he is older, just like you, now he is a lot like me already

165
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:34,159
Moses

166
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:57,159
Help me, i think my leg is broken

167
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,159
More than that

168
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:07,159
What did you say?

169
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:12,159
Who are you?

170
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:18,159
Who are you?

171
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:23,159
Im a sheperd, i thought you were a general?

172
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:30,159
I need a general

173
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:39,159
Why?, to fight.. or else

174
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:45,159
Fight who?..for what?

175
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:50,159
I think you know

176
00:55:55,159 --> 00:56:03,159
I think you should go and see whats happening to your people now, you wont be at peace until you do

177
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,159
Who are you?

178
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,159
I AM

179
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:58,159
You fell, Anything you saw..or think you saw afterwards was an effect of that, the storm..the storm started before

180
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:12,159
It was something else, but the boy was all in your head, how do you know?, because God isnt a boy

181
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:41,159
I have to tell you something.. i have to tell you something, i havent been completely honest with you

182
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:52,159
About what?, about who i am, about what ive done, and who i was, and how i feel

183
00:57:54,159 --> 00:58:06,159
What do you feel about me? (***), rest, rest

184
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:57,159
What are you doing here?, nothing..i cant sleep

185
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:09,159
Are you worried about me?, yes, dont..ill be fine

186
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:18,159
What does it look like?

187
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,159
Come inside...come inside!

188
00:59:51,159 --> 01:00:02,159
What are you going to do with all that?, make sure i see you again, are you doubting you cant see me forever?

189
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:29,159
What does this mean?, its someone i used to know

190
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:47,159
This is not forever..i will see you again..do you believe me?

191
01:00:53,159 --> 01:01:02,159
Dont ever..just say what people want to hear..but i will..i will see you again

192
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:19,159
will you keep this for me?, please look at me,

193
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:46,159
What kind of God tells a man to leave his family?, if you understand it..i'll understand it, i dont..im sorry i cant answer that question

194
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:53,159
If thats what faith means..i'll trade mine to keep you

195
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:07,159
Dont touch me, go..go!

196
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:27,159
Father, have you some water to spare?, yes, where did you come from?, i come from the sea..its a narrow and dangerous path

197
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:35,159
Thank you father

198
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:52,159
I remember you, you used to feel no pain

199
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:18,159
Welcome back brother

200
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:36,159
Here is the man, he was once a prince of Egypt

201
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:13,159
Im fine, everybody is fine

202
01:06:52,159 --> 01:07:03,159
You sleep so well, because you know you are loved, ive never slept so well

203
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:31,159
Im told that i should address you as Ramsees the great..now..

204
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:41,159
Moses..you are alive, i am glad you are alive, is that why you only sent two assassins to kill me?

205
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:50,159
Your mother, dont blame her, she wanted you dead, who do you think hid your sword where you would find it?

206
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:53,159
Moses

207
01:07:57,159 --> 01:08:06,159
You are not here to take your throne, its not about the prophecy that worries you so much its just something else

208
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:19,159
I have been told, that things here have become much worse, things are better than ever have been Moses

209
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:32,159
We have order, order?..order?, the slaves..their bodies burn..night and day now ive seen it with my own eyes, you call that order?

210
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:43,159
They are slaves, what do you expect?, they should be treated like Egyptians, they should have the same rights, they should be paid for their work or..you must
set them free

211
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:53,159
They are not Egyptians..they are slaves..what else would you expect?, they wouldnt know what to do (***) to fend for themselves like animals

212
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:57,159
Do not call them animals !!

213
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:05,159
This..from a economic stand point alone..what you are asking is problematic to say the least

214
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:18,159
I didnt expect to hear..a simple yes..but i do not want to hear..a simple no, is that what you are telling me? are you saying no?, im not saying no

215
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:28,159
Im saying time, time, you listened to Hebrews, i listen to Hebrews, who were you talking to?

216
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:36,159
GOD....GOD

217
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:40,159
Which God?

218
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:08,159
Are you seriously considering his proposal?, well is it a proposal if a man is holding a dagger to your throat?

219
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,159
I understand correctly thats um..demand

220
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:26,159
He has lost his mind..he has found a God..this God..or one of ours, i would like Moses

221
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:40,159
I want Moses dead, did you hear me?, yes, then..go

222
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:48,159
And..his family too

223
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:04,159
Moses?..where is Moses?

224
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:11,159
Moses?..where is Moses?

225
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:58,159
Moses?..his family..where?

226
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:29,159
This is not Moses, this is not his family

227
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:45,159
This is a man..his wife and his child who would ask the simple question..where is he?..answered..we dont know

228
01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:23,159
Carry this image..home with you tonight, and discuss why you would protect him..knowing that tommorow..at this time, there will be another family..and another day after
..and the day after that, dare i say more

229
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:18,159
You are not going to do anything?, i didnt say that

230
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:43,159
Where have you been?, watching you fail, at this rate it will take years..a generation

231
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:58,159
I thought you were making progress..now you are impatient, (***) for 400 years of slavery

232
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:14,159
Am i the only one sitting who has done nothing about it till now?, i do know a few things about military actions, still if you are not going to listen to me then why
did you take me away from my family!

233
01:17:15,159 --> 01:17:33,159
I didnt..you did, you dont need me?, maybe not, so do i do nothing?, for now..you are going to watch

234
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:20,159
Divine (GODS), i humbly call on you to purify the waters of our life giving river

235
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:39,159
How long?, not long

236
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,159
But longer than that

237
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:33,159
The Nile as we know carries muds of clay, this year there is much more of it than usual..drifting in on the currents..settling in the river banks..kicked up by the wild
thrashing of the crocodiles

238
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:47,159
This thrashing not only dramatically changed the color of the water but it was to point of killing the fish, but frogs as we know..can get out of the water when they have too

239
01:22:49,159 --> 01:23:01,159
But frogs still need water and when they cant find it in the streets or the city..which they wont, and they die?..they die!

240
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:18,159
And then the rats come, and the maggots come, and the flies come..and then..and then what!?, the flies die

241
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:18,159
Speak up!, its in Hebrew, Hebrew?, read it, this catastrophes are the work of God and they have not finished, they will get worse, we need to reach a settlement with
Moses

242
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:23,159
So..the words of God

243
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:42,159
Here is my settlement to you, workload shall be doubled and you will get no straw to make your bricks, perhaps your God will provide it you

244
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:22,159
I was impressed at first..not anymore, this is affecting everyone, so who are you punishing?

245
01:25:52,159 --> 01:26:01,159
What is this?, did you do this?, not me..not me, is this you?, no no, whats happened to you?

246
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:14,159
Move!, move!, move

247
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:54,159
And we have among ourselves a few hidden diseases that we dont clearly understand, the animals?..they are not exact and there is some conjecture that these disease can migrate
from the smallest creature..like um..a fly?

248
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:07,159
Have you been out to the river banks? im here to come ask help again..from 6 more gods

249
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:24,159
Is that it?, are you done?

250
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:52,159
Are you going to say something with your actions!?, did you meant to humble me!?, because it will not!

251
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:04,159
Initial reports suggests more than 10 million square cubits of crops have been lost

252
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:22,159
I suggest we return a portion of the supplement to the civil grainary an act of mercy..your people are starving, are you suggesting that i should starve too?, no

253
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:28,159
People have plenty of water

254
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:19,159
Is that you?..Moses?..brother

255
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:33,159
Have you come to negotiate?, because im ready, because ive had enough of you

256
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:43,159
One more thing happens, and i will bring my own plague to you

257
01:32:45,159 --> 01:33:00,159
You see every Hebrew child, not yet walking, and none shall, because i will drown them in the nile, like you should have been

258
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:10,159
Oh you say that you didnt cause all this, your God did?

259
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:16,159
I am god...i am god

260
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:33,159
So lets just see..who is more effective at killing..you?..this God?..or me?

261
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:59,159
Nice of you to come, is he giving you what you asked?

262
01:34:03,159 --> 01:34:09,159
Not yet, but his own people are turning against him, and his army?, it will, i disagree

263
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:21,159
Something worse has to happen, i disagree, anything more would be, would be what?..what are you about to say?..cruel?..inhuman?

264
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:31,159
its not easy to see the people who i grew up with suffering this much, what about the people you didnt grew up with? what thought did you give to them?

265
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:42,159
you still dont think of them as yours do you?, as long as ramsees has an army behind him nothing will change, anything more is just revenge, revenge?

266
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:55,159
After 400 years of brutal subjugation, these pharaohs imagine they are living gods, they are nothing more than flesh and blood, i want to see them on their knees begging
for it to stop!

267
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:59,159
Im tired of talking with a messenger!

268
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:12,159
General!, ive heard ramsees's final threats, so let me tell you whats going to happen next

269
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:20,159
No..no, you cannot do this..i want no part of this!

270
01:35:53,159 --> 01:35:55,159
Leave him

271
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,159
Moses

272
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:30,159
I can have you killed, i dont think so, unless you do it yourself, your own soldiers let me in

273
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:46,159
Im not negotiating anymore, thats not why im here, i came to tell you..that something is coming, that is out of my control

274
01:36:47,159 --> 01:37:03,159
Something that will affect thousands and thousands of citizens and it will affect you very personally Ramsees unless you accept what ive asked for and annouce it publicy before
the sun goes down

275
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:10,159
Ramsees do not..do not turn your back on me!

276
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:26,159
This has nothing to do..with you and i, this is far beyond that, this is about Egypts survival do you understand?

277
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:50,159
Sunset..after that it will be too late, what will be too late?, to protect your child, to protect your child tonight, is that a threat?

278
01:37:54,159 --> 01:38:03,159
Is that a threat?, Moses!, Moses!

279
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:15,159
Tell everyone, to slaughter a lamb and mark their doors and their doors post tonight with its blood

280
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:30,159
Why?, pitty the lambs if im wrong, but if im right..we will bless them for eternity

281
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:55,159
Ramsees?..Ramsees?, Ramsees?

282
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:54,159
Did the children die last nite? as did mine?

283
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:10,159
Is this your God?, killing children?, what kinds of fanatics worships such a God?

284
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:20,159
No Hebrew child died last night

285
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:51,159
Get..out, go, everyone of you!, go!

286
01:44:53,159 --> 01:45:01,159
Go to canaan if thats what you want, back to the homeland of your dreams, go!

287
01:45:05,159 --> 01:45:07,159
As you command

288
01:45:19,159 --> 01:45:29,159
This is the route i took, from here we move south to the Red Sea..the straights are here, at low tide we cross on foot

289
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:13,159
Now i know why you sleep so well at night, because you know you were loved

290
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:16,159
With respect if we are going to recapture 400,000 slaves we need more than 3 divisions, we will not be capturing anyone

291
01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:04,159
We should rest, no..we wont be safe until we cross the sea

292
01:49:13,159 --> 01:49:23,159
Ramsees and 4000 men, 1000 chariots, how far more it is? 4 days..less if they dont rest the horses

293
01:49:35,159 --> 01:49:38,159
We need to rest the horses

294
01:49:51,159 --> 01:50:02,159
The straights are that way, the longest easiest route is there at the western coast..or we go through the mountains

295
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:22,159
The mountains? why?, why dont we take that route? you can but so can Ramsees, the mountain pass is a dangerous place but they are too narrow for Ramsees's chariots, he
couldnt follow and that would give us a lead in time

296
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:25,159
What does God tell you?

297
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,159
The mountains

298
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:35,159
Can we make it?

299
01:51:51,159 --> 01:51:53,159
I need your help

300
01:52:01,159 --> 01:52:04,159
I dont know where i am

301
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:34,159
You wont help me, you wont help them

302
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:41,159
This way!

303
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,159
Move out!

304
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:10,159
This way, are you sure?

305
01:53:13,159 --> 01:53:20,159
I mean are you sure we can make it across with our equipments, our chariots, they didnt think they could make it with theirs

306
01:53:21,159 --> 01:53:27,159
How do they know?, they have never been here, Moses you mean?

307
01:54:09,159 --> 01:54:16,159
Is this high tide or low tide?, doesnt matter, this isnt the straights is it?, no

308
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:33,159
Do you even know where we are? yes, we are on a point on the earth where there is a sea and an army behind, so now what?, we have to rest

309
01:54:57,159 --> 01:55:15,159
Ive mislead all of them, i have abondon my family, i have failed you, im not what i thought i was

310
01:58:11,159 --> 01:58:20,159
What is it?, the current, its strong

311
01:58:29,159 --> 01:58:35,159
We need to cross here, we need to cross now

312
01:58:39,159 --> 01:58:49,159
We cross here, we cross here, ready yourselves!, we cross here!, go tell them, go!

313
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:57,159
Your orders are like the last of the Egyptian wimp, we are no longer slaves

314
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:05,159
Then you are..you are free, you have lost sight of canaan?

315
01:59:09,159 --> 01:59:25,159
You have honored me with your trust, now i honor you with my faith, follow me and you will be free, stay..and you will perish

316
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:41,159
Do not be afraid, GOD is with us, go!..ready yourselves!, go!, GOD is with us!, we cross here!

317
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:31,159
Joshua!, Aaron!

318
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:50,159
We must leave!

319
02:07:13,159 --> 02:07:18,159
Halt!, turn around!, turn around!

320
02:07:27,159 --> 02:07:32,159
Leave!, brother?, leave now! thats an order!

321
02:07:57,159 --> 02:08:01,159
Come on!, you'll never make it back!

322
02:10:49,159 --> 02:10:51,159
Its just me here

323
02:10:58,159 --> 02:11:00,159
Sit

324
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:14,159
My family..may be not far from here, your family?, i have a family a wife and a son

325
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:32,159
I was thinking, maybe i could convince them..convince them to join us, perhaps thats..perhaps thats not wise, of course they should come, we have a long way to go..a lot can happen

326
02:11:34,159 --> 02:11:44,159
And then when we get there..if we get there.., you dont think we will settle on canaan?, this place is a maze, what are our choices?

327
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:50,159
We are big as a nation tribe and that concerns people more, why?

328
02:11:58,159 --> 02:12:05,159
But we all are in the same boat, we are now, but what happens when we start running?

329
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:34,159
Ramsees..the great

330
02:14:04,159 --> 02:14:19,159
Did you know what you said?, when did i say it?, that you would trade your faith to keep me, no

331
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:26,159
You may need it more than ever now

332
02:14:39,159 --> 02:14:44,159
Who are they?, they are my people

333
02:14:52,159 --> 02:15:07,159
What makes you happy?, you do, what is the most important thing in your life?, you are, you are

334
02:15:12,159 --> 02:15:18,159
Will i leave you?, never

335
02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:28,159
May i proceed?, proceed

336
02:16:52,159 --> 02:17:07,159
What do you think of this?, no one will do it, if they didnt agree? (***)

337
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:39,159
These laws will guide them, if you disagree..you should put down the hammer
