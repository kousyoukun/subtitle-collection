\an8公元前1300年

2
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,710
\an8过去400年  希伯来人饱受埃及人奴役

3
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,710
\an8为埃及造就了雕像  城市以及荣耀

4
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,510
\an8但是他们从未忘记过自己的故乡

5
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,510
\an8以及他们的神

6
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,510
\an8神也从未忘记他们

7
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,290
希泰人在卡叠什城外驻扎了16000人的部队
It's true, the hittite army has 16,000 troops camped outside Kadesh.

8
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,470
他们的目的是什么
What's less clear is why.

9
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,600
希泰人想要跨越边境
The hittites are trying to cross the border.

10
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,090
显而易见
Obviously.

11
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,230
他们还想干嘛呢
What else would they be doing?

12
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,570
根据我们的情报  他们期盼我们进攻
Anticipating an invasion by us, according to our information.

13
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,220
他们以为我们
They think we are...

14
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,940
已然备战  但我们没有
Preparing an attack, which we are not.

15
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,480
我不想  也不愿意坐在这
What I don't want to do, and won't do, is sit here...

16
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,160
干等着希泰军队
And wait until we're fighting hittite armies...

17
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,450
兵临城下
Outside the palace walls.

18
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,950
来吧
Come.

19
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,880
内脏都说些什么
What do the entrails say?

20
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,300
内脏不会说话
They don't "say" anything.

21
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,970
它们只会暗示
They imply.

22
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,370
然后去解释暗示
And that's open to interpretation.

23
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
那就解释吧
So, interpret them.

24
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,380
我们能否先发制人赢得战争
We'll win or we won't in a preemptive attack?

25
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,390
能还是不能
It's a yes or a no.

26
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,900
尚不清楚
And it's not clear.

27
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,070
但能知道一个预言
But something else is.

28
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,690
战争中  一位首领会得救
In the battle, a leader will be saved...

29
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,740
救他的人某天会统治国家
And his savior will someday lead.

30
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,580
内脏或许应该说
Then the entrails should also say...

31
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,580
我们应该放弃理智
That we will abandon reason...

32
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,380
让预言来引领我们
And be guided by omens.

33
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,170
\an8埃及狮头女神
伟大的赛克迈特
Great sekhmet...

34
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,800
以你的名义  法老作饮
Pharaoh drinks in your name...

35
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,020
并祈祷卡叠什一战挫败希泰人
And prays for victory over the hittites at Kadesh.

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,980
时机一旦成熟  你就废了她
Your first order of business when the time comes, you retire her.

37
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,490
我会的
I will.

38
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,450
真不懂我父亲为什么没废了她
I don't know why my father hasn't.

39
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,450
只是  万一
But, just in case...

40
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,820
我身处险境  你就从其他路逃走
If you see me in any real danger out there, ride the other way.

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,170
我是认真的
I'm serious.

42
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,630
当我看着你  就像看到两个
When I look at you, I still see the two boys...

43
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,340
共同成长的孩子  亲如手足
Who grew up together, close as brothers.

44
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,130
如果有什么原因
If, for any reason...

45
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,590
让你们忘记这点
You ever forget that...

46
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,680
让这个提醒你们
Let these remind you.

47
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,640
长度足够在马背上攻击
Long enough to be effective from horseback...

48
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,510
却又不会让你拔不出来
Not so long that you trip over them.

49
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,810
这把是他的  我的在你那
This is his. You've got mine.

50
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,480
没错  我就是这么安排的
That's right. That's how I want it.

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,690
你们彼此拥有
You have each other's...

52
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,810
保证对方安全
To keep each other safe.

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,370
答应我你们会做到
Promise me you'll do that...

54
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,530
直到永远
Always.

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
在那
There!

58
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,260
把阿蒙队部署在背面  瑞队去中部
Deploy amun division to the north, ra division to the center...

59
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,650
卜塔队去南面  我们带领赛思队做后备
And ptah to the South. And we hold Seth in reserve.

60
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,680
-后备  -是的
-In reserve?  -Yes.

61
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,690
我们应该集中兵力在中部
We should concentrate our strength in the center.

62
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,700
你应该集中兵力去战斗
You should concentrate yours on fighting.

63
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,700
我来指挥
Leave the generalship to me.

64
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,190
射箭
Fire!

65
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,910
射箭
Fire!

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,430
冲啊
Charge!

带走拉美西斯  走
Take ramses! Go!

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,850
走
Go!

69
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,110
掉头  掉头
Turn around! Turn around!

70
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,120
摩西  摩西  摩西
Moses! Moses! Moses!

71
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,340
摩西
Moses.

72
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
那里发生了什么
What happened out there?

73
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
没什么
Nothing.

74
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,280
我问了指挥官同样的问题  他们和我撒谎
I asked the commanders the same thing. They, too, lied.

75
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
我受够了
And I'm tired of it.

76
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,530
您以为有事发生
He thinks something happened.

77
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,320
-其实没有  -什么意思
-But it didn't.   -Meaning?

78
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,150
高阶牧师  预言家
The high priestess, her prophecy.

79
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,320
她说她看不到谁赢
She said she couldn't see who would win.

80
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,840
却看到了"首领会得救"
The other one.  "The leader will be saved..."

81
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,290
之类的
And so on.

82
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,000
你救了我儿的命
You saved my son's life?

83
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,510
是的
Yes.

84
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,850
坐下
Sit.

85
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,840
"谢谢"一句远远不够
"Thank you" is not sufficient...

86
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,690
但是谢谢你
But thank you.

87
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,970
我知道你不相信预言之类
I know you don't believe  in omens or prophecies...

88
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,020
但我相信
But I do believe.

89
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,890
这我很敬重
And I respect that.

90
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,700
但这又如何
But this isn't anything.

91
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,200
我救了他也无任何意义
This doesn't even make any sense.

92
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,870
因为你不是我的血脉
Because you're not my blood.

93
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,320
是的
Yes.

94
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,030
你无法继承我的王位
It's true, you can't succeed me.

95
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,620
按常理不能
Not in the usual way.

96
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,210
无论如何都不能
Not in any way.

97
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,380
光坐这想肯定不能
In any way imaginable, sitting here.

98
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,710
这么说亲生儿子不应该
It's horrible to say this about one's own son...

99
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,220
但我相信你比他更适合领导
But I trust you more than him to lead.

100
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
"希泰人的马车
"The hittite chariotry...

101
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,440
"粉碎了我们的放手并开始进攻
"Crashed through our defense and began its attack.

102
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,570
"我发现自己被敌人包围"
I found myself surrounded by the enemy...

"No soldier, no shield-bearer...

"And rejoin ra division."

打住
Stop there.

109
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,800
有什么你想改撰的吗
Anything you'd like to rephrase?

110
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,130
没有
No.

111
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,050
-我能继续吗  -不用了  相信剩余情节没问题
-Shall I go on?  -No, I'm sure the rest is fine.

112
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,430
下来何事
What's next?

113
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,720
比东
Pithom.

114
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,890
怎么了
What about it?

115
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,640
那的形势  以及奴隶
The situation. The slaves.

116
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,600
好的  拉美西斯
Fine. Ramses.

117
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,520
什么
What?

118
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,440
去那  和总督会面  观察情况并报告给我
Go up there, meet with the viceroy,  look around, make a report.

119
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,030
我
Me?

120
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,100
那里终究属于你  长点兴趣吧
It will be yours someday. Take an interest in it.

121
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,270
还有何事
What else?

122
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,240
我去见总督吧
I'll go to see the viceroy.

123
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,590
不
No.

124
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
我去见他
I'll go.

125
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,210
这事不值得你去做
It's beneath you.

126
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,460
这事不值得任何将军去做
It's beneath any general.

127
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,970
我去吧
I'll do it.

128
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
拉美西斯
Ramses...

129
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,100
战场上发生的事情
Can we forget what happened...

130
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,060
我们忘掉它好吗
On the battlefield?

131
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,270
如果换做是我
If our positions had been reversed...

132
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,150
我也会救你的
I would've saved your life, too.

133
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,110
我知道
I know. I know.

134
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,330
抓的很准啊
It was a good shot.

135
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,670
即使上帝指引着你的目标
Even if the gods did guide your aim.

136
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,180
血液里有点毒液是好事
A little venom in your blood is a good thing.

137
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,090
可以让你抵挡住下一次有毒的攻击
Makes you less vulnerable to the next poisonous bite.

138
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,130
甚至可以抵挡我父亲
Maybe even my father's.

139
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,130
\an8比东

140
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,550
欢迎来到比东
Welcome to pithom.

141
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,390
你得习惯这的味道
You get used to the smell.

142
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,580
总督似乎挺享受他在这的安逸生活
The viceroy seems to be enjoying a good share of his resources.

143
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,340
这里的差事可不是谁都想干的  我的主人
This isn't a job everyone wants to do, my lord.

144
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,540
为了保持他的干劲  些许舒适安逸是有必要的
A certain degree of comfort is necessary to keep up his spirits.

145
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,460
你到问题所在么  这年头人活的太长
You know what the problem is? People live too long these days.

146
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,660
每年  死亡率远低于出生率
Every year, the death rate lags further behind the birth rate.

147
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,940
这些人
And these people...

148
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,850
他们把生育当成运动一样
They reproduce like it's a sport.

149
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,350
增长的劳动力是个问题
This is the problem? A growing work force?

150
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,030
当然不是了  生育是件好事
No, of course not. It's good for production.

151
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,570
当然是好事  问题是
Of course it is, but only to a point.

152
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,110
当众人想要你死
When that population wants you dead...

153
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,080
这就会是问题
Yes, it's a problem.

154
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,780
所以  要么给我更多的军队维持秩序
So, either I'm given more troops to maintain order...

155
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,460
要么我开始缩减人口
Or I start thinning out the herd.

156
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,630
就因为这个荒谬的理论
You start slaughtering people...

157
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,590
你就想屠杀人民
For no reason other than this precarious theory...

158
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,640
你期望避免的事  恰恰会是你惹出来的
You will provoke the very thing you say you wish to avoid.

159
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,460
行啊  那就给我军队
Fine, then give me the troops.

160
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,770
我们下去和他们聊聊
Let's go down and talk to them.

161
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,970
为什么呢
Why on earth?

162
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,470
你担心叛乱  那我们看看你的担心是否属实
You're worried about sedition. Let's find out if that worry is real.

163
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,770
通过和他们聊聊
By talking to them?

164
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,110
通过和他们聊时
By looking at them...

165
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,570
我观察他们
When I talk with them.

166
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,280
通过注视人的眼睛
You can tell a lot about somebody...

167
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,990
你能看出很多东西
Looking him in the eye.

168
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,660
我很了解这些
Let me tell you something...

169
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,330
希伯来人
About hebrews.

170
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,160
他们阴险  好斗
They are a conniving, combative people.

171
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,460
知道在他们的语言里
Do you know what "israelite" means...

172
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,710
"以色列"是什么意思
In their own language?

173
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,130
"与上帝斗争之人"
"He who fights with God."

174
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,630
"与上帝角逐之人"
"He who wrestles with God."

175
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,290
两者有区别
There is a difference.

176
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,810
或许我没你有文化
I may not be as educated as you, which,

177
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,520
显然  你想提醒我这点
apparently, you want to remind me of.

178
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,640
但我每天都要应付他们
But I have to deal with them every day.

179
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,220
我清楚自己在说什么
I know what I'm talking about.

180
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,650
你不用去  我自己下去
You don't have to come. I'll go down there myself.

181
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,970
住手
Stop!

182
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,150
他为何受惩罚
Why is he being punished?

183
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,230
他老捣蛋  我的主人
Persistent troublemaker, my lord.

184
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,690
他为何在笑
Why is he smiling?

185
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
他说他没痛觉  我的主人
He says he feels no pain, my lord.

186
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,870
那何必鞭打他
Then why whip him?

187
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,800
不是随机召集你们来的
You were not gathered up at random.

188
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
我要求见见
I asked to see...

189
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,590
年长者
The elders.

190
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,050
快告诉我  你们祈求什么
Come on. What do you pray for?

191
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,390
\an8巴勒斯坦  叙利亚和黎巴嫩等地的古称
我们祈求再见到迦南
We pray to see canaan again.

192
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,560
再见到迦南
Canaan again?

193
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,810
你们从给见过它
You've never seen it.

194
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,810
我见过迦南
I've seen canaan.

195
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,560
比印度军队更残暴的一些部落占据着它
I've seen that it's inhabited by tribes fiercer than Egypt's military.

196
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,220
所以  你们回不到那了
So, you won't be returning to it...

197
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,640
假如你们真的打那来
Or, if you do, from it.

198
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,570
-上帝不这么说  -哪位上帝
-God says otherwise. -Which God?

199
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,910
你们的上帝  亚伯拉罕上帝
Your God? The God of Abraham?

200
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,730
说你们是特殊之群的上帝
The God that says that you are special?

201
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,910
说你们是天选之人
That you are chosen?

202
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,290
过来  来
Come here. Up.

203
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,440
过来
Come here.

204
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
你们的上帝是错的
He's wrong.

205
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,510
看得出你坚信不疑  这可是个问题
I can see you're unconvinced, and that's a problem.

206
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,830
因为不切实际的信仰下来是盲信
Because next to unrealistic belief lies fanaticism...

207
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,210
接着是叛乱  接着就是革命
And next to that, sedition, and next to that, revolution.

208
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,970
这一切起源于年长者
And it all starts with the elders.

209
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,020
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

210
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,090
你叫什么
What's yours?

211
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,730
我会告诉你
I'll tell you.

212
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,360
我叫摩西  比西亚之子
I am Moses, son of bithia...

213
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,140
霍伦赫布之孙
Grandson of horemheb.

214
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,410
记下此人和其他人的姓名
Record this one's name and the rest of them.

215
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,360
把下一组人带上来
Bring in the next group.

216
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,540
我名叫努恩
My name is nun.

217
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
我的主人
My lord!

218
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,500
-站住  -放他进来
-Stop there!  -Let him through.

219
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,840
年长者有话要说
There's something the elder has to tell you.

220
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,510
这里不方便
But not here.

221
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,630
告诉我何时何地
Say where and when.

222
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,250
今晚  祷告屋
The prayer house, tonight.

223
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,840
拿着
Here.

224
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,280
你活着回来了
I see you've survived your adventure.

225
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,030
抱歉又让你等
Sorry to make you wait again.

226
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,770
没在等你
I'm not waiting.

227
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,660
-采石场之行如何  -挺好
-How was your trip to the quarry?  -Fine.

228
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,810
你见到了我在应对的
You saw what I'm up against.

229
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
告诉我
Tell me...

230
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,160
在我离开前  还有什么记录需要我提供给你
Is there any more of my records I could get for you before you leave?

231
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,490
你能否告诉我
You can tell me...

232
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,630
这一切是否汇报给孟斐斯
Has all of this been reported to Memphis?

233
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,090
是否被批准  是否有书面记录
Was it approved? Do you have it in writing?

234
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,420
当然  都记录下来了
Of course. It's on record.

235
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,920
介意我们查看下吗
So you don't mind if we check?

236
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,640
当然不介意
Of course I don't mind.

237
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,930
但不理解到底怎么了
But I don't understand what's gone wrong.

238
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,020
我做了什么让你不开心的事
Have I done something to displease you?

239
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,270
如果是  如何才能让你开心
And if so, is there any way I could please you?

240
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,810
别过国王般的日子
You can stop living like a king.

241
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,070
你不是国王
You're not one.

242
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,790
"你会重新占领迦南"
"...and you will occupy the land of canaan."

243
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,420
迦南已被占领
Canaan is already occupied.

244
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,670
上帝允诺我们能回去
God promises we will return.

245
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,970
作为囚徒还是死人
In chains or in coffins?

246
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,420
作为自由人
As free men...

247
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,000
去往淌着牛奶和蜂蜜的土地
Into a land flowing with milk and honey.

248
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,770
他们能在外等着吗  我们并不危险
Can they at least wait outside? We're not dangerous.

249
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,320
去马那等着
Wait by the horses.

250
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,280
你相信巧合吗
Do you believe in coincidence?

251
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,270
完全相信
As much as anything else.

252
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,200
我认为这次不是巧合
I don't think this is one.

253
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,530
什么不是巧合
What isn't?

254
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,240
你来比东
You coming to pithom.

255
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,450
你为何而来
Why did you come?

256
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,610
生意
Business.

257
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
坐
Sit.

258
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
你父亲是谁
Who's your father?

259
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,140
知道你说不出他的名字
I know you don't know his name...

260
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,140
只知道他是法老军队的一名将军
Only that he was a general in pharaoh's army...

261
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,430
你母亲从未说起过他名字
Unnamed by your mother.

262
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,720
看得出这话题让你不爽
I can see this is making you uncomfortable.

263
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,280
这事你会感兴趣
This will interest you.

264
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,950
没有什么将军
There was no general.

265
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,520
你母亲
Your mother...

266
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,740
你喊做母亲的女人  没有孩子
The woman you call your mother, has no children.

267
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,200
你一出生就是奴隶
You were born a slave.

268
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,120
别走  别走
Don't go. Don't go.

269
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,920
我走是为你好
It's better for you that I do.

270
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
我走了
I'm leaving.

271
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,130
现在你走了  还是会回来的
If you leave now, you'll just come back...

272
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,830
因为你知道有些事不对劲  你一直有这感觉
Because you know something's wrong. You've always felt it.

273
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,050
拜托
Please.

274
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,390
所有人出去
Everybody out.

275
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,350
出去
Out.

276
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,200
你出生那年
The year of your birth...

277
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,690
有预言说会我们的领袖将诞生
There was a prophecy that our leader would be born...

278
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,700
来救我们于水火之中
To liberate us from our bondage.

279
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,370
因此  孟斐斯就下诏书
And so, there was an edict from Memphis...

280
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,830
命令杀害每个希伯来新生儿
To kill every firstborn Hebrew boy.

281
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,750
你父母不想让这事发生
Your parents didn't wait for that to happen.

282
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,670
任何你活命的办法都好过没有办法
Any chance of your survival was better than no chance.

283
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,330
他们把你交给了你姐
They handed you to your sister.

284
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,380
她把你放篮子里  带到了河边
She took you in a basket to the banks of the river...

285
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,560
把你漂到了只有她知道的地方
And she floated you to where she knew...

286
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,900
法老帕拉美西的女儿  比西亚
Pharaoh paramesse's daughter, bithia, bathed.

287
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,740
比西亚收留了你和你姐  仆人米里亚姆
Bithia took you and your sister, Miriam, as a maid...

288
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,810
把你们当成亲生的来抚养
And raised you as her own.

289
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,910
她很爱你
She probably even loved you...

290
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,610
但从没告诉任何人真相  包括你
But she never told you, or anyone else, the truth.

291
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,940
你是希伯来人
You are Hebrew.

292
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,110
这是真相
The truth?

293
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,410
真相是  这都算不上一个好故事
The truth is, it's not even that good a story.

294
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,870
你们这些人都擅长
And I thought you people were meant to be...

295
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,050
说故事
Good storytellers.

296
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,150
喂  奴隶
You, slave.

297
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,650
喂
You!

298
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,070
想要为这个情报领赏吗
Do you expect a reward for this information?

299
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,040
能服务于你就是我们的奖赏
Our reward is being of service to you.

300
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,130
当然了  如果
That said, if there were...

301
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,410
你有比这更好的奖赏
Some token you had in mind beyond that...

302
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,340
我们也不会拒绝的
We wouldn't refuse it.

303
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,180
那这个奖赏如何
How about this, then?

304
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,250
我不杀你们  如何
What about if I don't kill you?

305
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,220
这就足够了
That would be sufficient payment.

306
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,100
你们这帮人
You people.

307
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,440
请退下
Please leave.

308
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,150
请
Please.

309
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
情况如何
How did it go?

310
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,910
下次再谈这事吧
We can talk about that another time.

311
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,450
现在就谈
We can talk about it now...

312
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,570
好让我在苦瓜脸军医的照料下喘息会
If only as a respite from this army of grim-faced physicians.

313
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,460
坐
Sit.

314
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,140
我自己看了下市政记录
We're taking a thorough look at the city records...

315
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,890
显然总督是个贼
And the man is clearly a thief.

316
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,600
真是人生莫大的讽刺啊
It's one of life's more depressing ironies...

317
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,440
一个渴望权力之人
That the men who crave power...

318
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,810
最适合当权之人  确是最不善用权力之人
Are best fitted to acquire it, and least fitted to exercise it.

319
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,660
怎么了  摩西
What's wrong, Moses?

320
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,820
你病了
You're sick.

321
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,660
有事困扰着你
Something else is troubling you.

322
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,500
我看得出来
I can tell.

323
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,830
没有  没什么事
No, nothing else.

324
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,860
愿你时刻警惕
May you be alert...

325
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,350
得重生并受上帝庇佑
Rejuvenated and protected by the gods...

326
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,680
与世长存
Every moment of your eternal life.

327
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,530
往左
And to the left.

328
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,710
不  你的左边
No, your left.

329
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,250
再过去点
More, more, more.

330
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,580
很好
Good.

331
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,590
它很高啊
It is tall.

332
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,970
纪念碑就是纪念碑
Monuments are monuments...

333
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,390
因为它们能做纪念
For a reason. They inspire.

334
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,890
这纪念碑纪念什么
Inspire what, in this case?

335
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,390
纪念一切权力
In this, and in every case, power.

336
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,760
不管是什么  大声说出来吧
Say it out loud, whatever it is.

337
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,400
比东的总督在门外
The viceroy of pithom is outside.

338
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,740
议事日程是没有他
He's not on the agenda.

339
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,400
让他回比东去
He can go back to pithom until he is.

340
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,070
不  我们应该处理这事
No, we should deal with this.

341
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,480
叫他进来
Bring him in.

342
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,580
如果你想来请求新国王的原谅
If you came here to beg the new king's forgiveness...

343
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,470
想都别想
It won't work.

344
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,130
逮捕他
Arrest him.

345
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,290
请等一下
Wait, please.

346
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,960
能让我说句话吗
May I at least respond?

347
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,310
请求你
I beg you.

348
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,970
这关乎你的利益
It's in your interest.

349
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,010
-长话短说  -好的
-You make it short.  -I will...

350
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,300
只能对国王一人说
To the king alone.

351
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,270
我建议
My advice is that...

352
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,980
他和其他人离开房间
He, and the other generals, also leave the room.

353
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,440
是嘛
Really?

354
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,310
你的建议
That's your advice?

355
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,610
你不是他的军师
You are not his advisor.

356
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,150
没错  你才是
That's right. You are.

357
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,280
没错
That's right.

358
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,880
摩西
Moses.

359
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,290
摩西
Moses.

360
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,000
除了总督其他人出去
Everybody but the viceroy...

361
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,540
出去
Out.

362
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,360
有个坏消息
Terrible news.

363
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,870
你来了
There you are.

364
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,610
那么
So...

365
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,830
那个总督
The viceroy.

366
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,700
你没逮捕他
You didn't arrest him.

367
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,330
你没有听从我这个首席军师的建议
You didn't take your chief advisor's advice.

368
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,710
没有  他来
No, he came.

369
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,930
告诉我关于两个卫兵的事
He told me of an incident involving two guards...

370
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,180
其中一个在袭击中幸存了下来
One of which survived the attack.

371
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,190
我和他说我不在乎这种事
And I told him I did not care.

372
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,010
然后  他告诉了我一个难以置信的故事
And then, he told me the most unbelievable story.

373
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,970
他说  消息完全可靠
Told to him, he said, by very reliable sources.

374
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,560
我给了他点压力
Then, when pressed...

375
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,030
他透露出他们都是希伯来间谍
He admitted that they were Hebrew spies.

376
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,860
你懂我的意思
You know what I'm talking about.

377
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,230
是的
Yes.

378
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,540
你是怎么想的
And what do you make of it?

379
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,280
我觉着这很无礼  也很荒谬
I think it's offensive, and I think it's ridiculous.

380
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,710
是啊
Yes. Yes!

381
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,500
你  所有人  都是希伯来人
You, of all people, a Hebrew.

382
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,670
然后我说
And I said...

383
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,580
我要这么相信这事
How can I believe such a story?

384
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,090
兄弟
Cousin...

385
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,710
你不能信
You can't.

386
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,340
如果我选择相信这事呢  摩西
What if I take the chance of believing it, Moses?

387
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,770
我要怎么做
What am I to do?

388
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,230
比西亚
Bithia!

389
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,850
母亲
Mother.

390
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,940
那人是个贼
The man is a thief.

391
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,370
是我儿子发现了这事
My son discovers this.

392
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,030
而不是你
Not you.

393
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,530
他也报告给了你父亲  要不是你父亲他死了
And he reports it to your father, who would have hanged this thief...

394
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
就会把那人绞死
If he hadn't been dying himself.

395
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,290
你却相信了他自私荒诞的谎言
You believe his feeble, self-serving lies.

396
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,080
我只想知道是否属实
All I want to know is if it is true.

397
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,540
不要长篇大论了
I didn't ask for a tirade.

398
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
这事谈的越多
To talk about this any longer...

399
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,760
就会越夸大
Would dignify it...

400
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,050
-我不想再谈了  -那就回答
-And I won't do that.  -Answer the question.

401
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,850
是或否
Yes or no?

402
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,090
我在和你说话么
Was I talking to you?

403
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,420
带她上来  带她上来
Bring her in. Bring her in.

404
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,310
快
Now!

405
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,470
米里亚姆
Miriam!

406
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,060
过来  坐下
Come. Sit down.

407
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,730
有些事我要问你
Now, I'm going to ask you some things...

408
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,690
或许你觉得问题很奇怪
That are going to seem very strange to you.

409
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,620
只需要你如实回答
I just would like you to answer them truthfully.

410
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,660
你了解摩西吗
How do you know Moses?

411
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,070
我知道我多了解他
You know how I know him...

412
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,580
还有你
And you.

413
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,710
我抚养了你俩
I helped raise you both.

414
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,620
你不是他姐  对吧
So you are not his sister, then?

415
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,750
当然不是
Of course not.

416
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,850
你也不是希伯来人
And you're not a Hebrew.

417
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,210
不是
No.

418
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,590
把你手放在桌上
Place your arm on the table.

419
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,110
拉美西斯
Ramses...

420
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,140
别做傻事
don't be stupid!

421
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
我没在和你说话
I am not talking to you!

422
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,410
我在和她说
I am talking to her.

423
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,780
米里亚姆  把整个手放桌上
Your whole arm on the table, Miriam.

424
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,410
谢谢
Thank you.

425
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,910
拉美西斯
Ramses...

426
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,200
别把事搞大了
Don't take this any further.

427
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,300
别把事搞大了  否则呢
Don't take this any further, or what?

428
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,540
别把事搞大了
Do not take this any further.

429
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,970
你确定要对着干
Are you quite sure about that?

430
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,680
把手拿开  或者马上拿起它
Get your hand off it, or use it, now.

431
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,550
或许你想回答这个问题
Or perhaps you'd like to answer the question?

432
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,390
那我继续了
Then I'll proceed.

433
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,570
米里亚姆  我再问你一遍
Miriam, I'm going to ask you again...

434
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,930
如果回答仍不
And if your answer is again no...

435
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,950
对接下来的事我就表示遗憾了
I apologize for what happens next.

436
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,410
你是他姐吗
Are you his sister?

437
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
不是
No.

438
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,180
是的
Yes!

439
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,350
是的
Yes!

440
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,760
不需要理由你也能杀了他  但你有理由
You don't need a reason to kill him, but you have one.

441
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,590
-这是叛国  -怎么叛国了
-This was treason. -How was it treason?

442
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,880
他承认他知道
He just admitted he knew.

443
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,300
那不算是承认
That wasn't an admission!

444
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,970
他只是不想她的手被砍掉
Simply did not want her arm lopped off!

445
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,840
我从他眼里看出来
I saw it in his eyes.

446
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,940
他不相信这个故事
He does not believe this story.

447
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,780
我也不想去相信它
I don't want to believe it!

448
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,810
你想要相信  因为这是除掉他的一个机会
You want to believe it, because it's an opportunity to be rid of him...

449
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,990
你一直都想这么干
Which you always wanted.

450
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,280
我没说要"流放"他  而是要他死
I didn't say "exiled," I said "dead."

451
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,000
我肯定  他会死在
That, I'm sure, will follow...

452
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,460
他要去的地方
Where he's going.

453
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,460
锡安
Khyan...

454
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,300
允许我和我母亲说句话
Allow me to talk to my mother.

455
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,380
好的  长官
Yes, sir, yes.

456
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,910
过来  米里亚姆
Come, Miriam.

457
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,070
并不是每个人都会去保护
It isn't every man who would protect a servant

458
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,610
对他来说微不足道的仆人
who's nothing more to him than that.

459
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,620
至少这个家族没有这样的人
Certainly no one else in this family...

460
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,330
包括我
Including me.

461
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,040
我本不该说出他想听到的答案
I wouldn't have said what he wanted to hear.

462
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,430
她也是
And neither would she.

463
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,380
我们非常爱你
That's how much we love you.

464
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,730
"我们"
"We"?

465
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,270
这不是真的
It's not true.

466
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,530
是真的
It is true.

467
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,520
我把你带到河边时  你戴着这个
You were wearing this when I brought you to the river.

468
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,110
我把它摘下来  目的很明确
I took it off you for obvious reasons.

469
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,000
那才是你
That's you.

470
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,040
这是你和你母亲之间维系的物
The connection between you and our mother.

471
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,760
你姐救了你
Your sister saved your life.

472
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,920
现在你救了她
Now you saved hers...

473
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,930
摩西
Moshe.

474
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,450
米里亚姆
Miriam.

475
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,050
抱歉  长官
Sorry, sir.

476
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,280
摩西
Moses!

477
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,480
摩西
Moses!

478
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,150
我没啥可偷的了
I have nothing to steal.

479
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,060
我的马死了
My horse is dead.

480
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,700
我们不是来要你的马  摩西
We're not here for your horse, moshe.

481
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,700
\an8红海  蒂朗海峡

482
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,620
再高一点
A little bit higher.

483
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,760
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

484
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,850
别停  继续干活
Don't stop. Keep working.

485
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,640
喂  给我们的羊弄点水
You, get water for our goats.

486
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,860
喂
You.

487
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,200
还没轮到你
Wait your turn.

488
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,090
把你们的羊从水槽那赶走
Move your animals away from the troughs.

489
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,090
又属于你们的了
It's yours again.

490
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,040
你从哪来
Where are you from?

491
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,550
西面
West of here.

492
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,050
你要去哪
Where are you going?

493
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,960
东面
East.

494
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,300
你犯了何事
What did you do?

495
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,220
什么意思
What do you mean?

496
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,010
你犯了什么罪
You committed some crime?

497
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,140
恕我直言
With respect...

498
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,010
您女儿邀请我来用餐
Your daughters invited me for some food.

499
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,520
没说会审问我
They did not tell me there would be an interrogation.

500
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,100
抱歉
I'm sorry.

501
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,570
我只是好奇
I'm just curious.

502
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,860
欢迎你在饭前清洗下身子
You are welcome to get cleaned up before dinner...

503
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,040
如果你愿意的话
If that appeals to you...

504
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,390
今晚你也可以留下
And stay the night if you want...

505
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,790
明天继续赶路
Before continuing on...

506
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,790
不管你要去哪
To wherever it is.

507
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,080
谢谢你
Thank you.

508
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,400
和我描述下孟斐斯吧
Describe Memphis to someone...

509
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
我从未有机会也不会有机会去那
Who's never been there and never will.

510
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,230
它
It's...

511
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,540
我不想用"文明"这词
I don't want to say "civilized"...

512
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,860
不想冒犯你们  但它确实是文明城市
Because I don't want to offend, but it is civilized.

513
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,780
那里不仅仅是羊多
There's more there than sheep and goats.

514
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,410
这里也不仅仅是羊多
There's more here than that.

515
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,130
真的  有什么
Really? Where?

516
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,760
抱歉  我真无礼
I'm sorry, that was rude.

517
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,510
我真无礼
That was rude.

518
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,920
虽然住在这  但我并不无知
I'm not ignorant just because I live here.

519
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,770
看得出来
I can see that.

520
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,690
我敢说
I can tell you one thing.

521
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,820
目前为止
This is by far...

522
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,440
在我来的和要去的地方
The nicest place...

523
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,900
这里地方最棒
Between here and there.

524
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,080
你要走了
And so you're leaving?

525
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,440
当然
Of course.

526
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,990
我这样的人不属于这里
There's nothing here for someone like me.

527
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,620
什么时候
When?

528
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,460
今天
Today?

529
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,380
牢记此时此刻
Remember this moment in time...

530
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,310
誓言之后
For after these vows...

531
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,610
你将向世界宣布
You shall say to the world...

532
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,650
"这是我丈夫"这是我妻子"
"This is my husband." "This is my wife."

533

我  西坡拉
I, zipporah...

534
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,660
我  摩西
I, Moses...

535
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,580
-西坡拉  我愿意  -摩西  我愿意
-Accept you, zipporah...  -Accept you, Moses...

536
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,290
接受你真正的样子
To be no other than yourself.

537
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,330
深爱我所了解的你
Loving what I know of you...

538
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,330
信赖我所不知道的你
Trusting what I do not yet know.

539
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,300
相敬如宾
With respect...

540
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,680
真心诚意
For your integrity...

541
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,210
忠贞不渝
And faith...

542
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,010
相亲相爱
In your abiding love for me.

543
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,550
不管生活如何
In all that life may bring us...

544
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,810
我都承诺爱你
I pledge my love.

545
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,310
我都承诺爱你
I pledge my love.

546
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,190
谁让你幸福
Who makes you happy?

547
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,280
你啊
You do.

548
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,360
你生命中什么最重要
What's the most important thing in your life?

549
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,870
你啊
You are.

550
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,410
你想去哪里
Where would you rather be?

551
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,740
哪也不去
Nowhere.

552
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,450
何时离我而去
And when will you leave me?

553
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,960
永远不会
Never.

554
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,460
继续
Proceed.

555
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,460
\an89年后

556
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,110
我说婆赛
I said "per se."

557
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,190
我不想讨论我墓穴
I don't want to discuss my tomb, per se.

558
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,110
我只想知道你为什么一直喜欢讨论我的墓穴
I want to discuss why you seem to want to discuss it all the time.

559
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,250
恕我直言
Respectfully...

560
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,080
这是你继位以来第一个建筑项目
It should have been your first construction order on taking the throne.

561
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,740
你可以想象  工程之大
It'll be a big project, as you might imagine.

562
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,090
显然  我的宫殿也是
So is my house, apparently.

563
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,870
宫殿有什么问题
Is there a problem with the palace?

564
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,510
它还没完工
It's not done.

565
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,370
不会太久的
It won't be long now.

566
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,340
几个月前你也这么说  而我住的像个
You said that months ago. Meanwhile I'm living there like...

贝都因人
A bedouin.

568
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,630
赶紧完工
Get it done.

569
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,810
快点
Faster!

570
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,720
是否需要我杀掉点人
Or do I have to kill somebody?

571
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,640
我们都了解你的意思了
I think you made your point.

572
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,360
扔的好准  父亲
Good throw, father.

573
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,080
只要瞄高一点
Just aim a little higher.

574
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,080
差点
Almost.

575
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,180
你去过山顶吗
Have you ever been to the top?

576
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,140
没有
No.

577
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,350
想去吗
Would you like to?

578
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,060
母亲说禁止去那
Mother says it's forbidden.

579
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,110
谁禁止
By who?

580
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,150
我们的上帝
Our God.

581
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,110
我们的上帝
Our God...

582
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,490
不允许我们爬山
Stops us from climbing mountains?

583
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,200
不是每座山
Not every Mountain.

584
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,990
只那一座
Just that one.

585
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,330
它是上帝之山
It's God's Mountain.

586
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,010
你让他感到困惑
You're confusing him.

587
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,810
不是我本意
I'm not trying to.

588
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:51,690
让我们的孩子没有信仰的成长  这好吗
Is it good for our boy to grow up believing in nothing?

589
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,740
信仰自己的成长  不好吗
Is it bad to grow up believing in yourself?

590
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,150
-这是我的信仰  -我知道
-It's my faith.  -I know.

591
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,940
-这也是他的  -我理解
-And it's his, too.  -I understand.

592
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,950
当他大了再做选择
He can make up his mind when he's older.

593
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,540
-对  -就和你一样
-Yes.  -Just like you.

594
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,370
很多方面他已经很像我
He's a lot like me already.

595
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,240
摩西
Moshe.

596
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,100
救救我
Help me!

597
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,760
我的腿可能断了
I think my leg is broken.

598
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,390
不单如此
More than that.

599
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,240
你说什么
What did you say?

600
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,450
你是谁
Who are you?

601
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,910
你是谁
Who are you?

602
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,960
我是个牧羊人
I'm a Shepherd.

603
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,090
我以为你是个将军
I thought you were a general.

604
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,590
我需要位将军
I need a general.

605
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,440
为什么
Why?

606
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,140
去打仗
To fight.

607
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,680
还能干嘛
Why else?

608
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,820
对抗谁
Fight who?

609
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,030
为何而战
For what?

610
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,490
我想你知道
I think you know.

611
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:58,340
你该去看看你的人民现在的处境
I think you should go and see what's happening to your people now.

612
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,120
否则他们终不得安宁
He won't be at peace until you do.

613
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,840
或在你看来
Or are they not people...

614
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,630
他们不是你的人民
In your opinion?

615
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,510
你是谁
Who are you?

616
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,360
我就是我
I am.

617
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,330
我就是我
I am.

618
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,330
你撞到头了
You were hit on the head.

619
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,390
之后你所看到的
Anything you saw...

620
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,890
或你以为你看到的
Or think you saw afterwards...

621
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,420
都是幻觉
Was an effect of that.

622
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,020
风暴
The storm...

623
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:58,470
在我撞到头之前风暴就开始了
The storm started before I was hit on the head.

624
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,770
-那不是风暴  -好了  好了
-It was not a storm. -Fine, fine.

625
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,650
风暴是真的
The storm was something.

626
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,690
风暴不是真的
It was something else.

627
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,530
-但你脑子里全是那个孩子  -你怎么知道
-But the boy was all in your head. -How do you know?

628
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,660
你怎么知道
How do you know?

629
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:09,690
因为上帝不是个孩子
Because God isn't a boy!

630
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,440
那他看起来像什么
Then what does he look like?

631
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,200
描述下  给我描述下
Describe him. Describe him to someone like me.

632
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,520
你说话听起来像什么知道吗
Do you know what you sound like?

633
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:21,330
听起来我像在妄想
Yes. I sound delusional.

634
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,370
是的
Yes.

635
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,330
是的
Yes.

636
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,620
-你需要好好休息  -是的  是的
-You just need more rest. -Yes, yes.

637
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,930
我有事要告诉你
I have to tell you something.

638
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,720
我有事要告诉你
I have to tell you something.

639
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,050
我对你没完全坦诚
I've not been completely honest with you.

640
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,260
是什么
About what?

641
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,940
我的身份
About who I am.

642
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,730
我所做所为以及我的身份
About what I've done and who I was.

643
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,360
还有我的感受
And how I feel.

644
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,240
-关于你对我的感受  -不是
-About what you feel about me?  -No.

645
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,500
对于你的感受我一直是真诚的
No, I've been honest about that.

646
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,790
休息吧
Rest.

647
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,590
-休息  -别离开我
-Rest.  -Don't leave me.

648
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,010
不  不
No. No.

649
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,650
摩西
Moshe.

650
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,040
革舜
Gershom?

651
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,010
你在这干嘛
What are you doing out here?

652
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,050
没什么
Nothing.

653
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,600
睡不着
I can't sleep.

654
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,170
在担心我
Are you worried about me?

655
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,720
是的
Yes.

656
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,360
别担心
Don't.

657
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,440
我没事
I'll be fine.

658
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,240
那是什么
What's that?

659
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:15,820
它看起来像什么
What's it look like?

660
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,030
进来
Come inside.

661
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,000
进来
Come inside!

662
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,740
你拿它们要做什么
What are you going to do with all that?

663
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,860
确保我能再见到你
Make sure I see you again.

664
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,410
放下它  你一直能见着我
Put it down and you can see me forever.

665
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,100
这是什么意思
What's this mean?

666
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,230
这是某个我认识的人名
It's someone I used to know.

667
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,780
我不会一去不回
This is not forever.

668
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,030
还会回来见你
I will see you again.

669
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,790
相信我吗
Do you believe me?

670
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,130
乖乖的
Good for you.

671
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,170
不要说一些人们想要听的话
Don't ever just say what people want to hear.

672
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,540
我会
But I will...

673
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,460
我会再见到你
I will see you again.

674
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,100
能替我保管好这个吗
Will you keep this for me?

675
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,230
革舜
Gershom.

676
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,200
革舜  看着我
Gershom, please look at me.

677
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,550
什么样的上帝会让一个男人
What kind of God tells a man...

678
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,620
离开他的家庭
To leave his family?

679
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,760
如果你能理解  我也会理解
If you understand it, I'll understand it.

680
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,880
我不理解
I don't.

681
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,720
所以回答不了你
So I can't answer that question.

682
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,350
如果这是信仰的意思  我愿意背弃自己信仰
If that's what faith means, I will trade mine...

683
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,890
维护你的信仰
To keep you.

684
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,700
别碰我
Don't touch me.

01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,490
走
Go.

686
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,950
走
Go!

687
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,510
老爹  能给点牛奶吗

688
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,100
好的
Yes.

689
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,100
你来自哪里
Where did you come from?

690
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,860
我来自海边
I come from the sea.

691
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:26,660
这条路狭窄凶险
It's a narrow and dangerous path.

692
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,200
谢谢你  老爹
Thank you, father.

693
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:49,620
耶和华  我记得你

694
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,650
你仍没有痛觉

695
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,670
看着马
Keep your eye on the horse.

696
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,940
-谢谢  -欢迎回来  兄弟

697
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,730
亚伦

698
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,150
你哥哥
Your brother.

699
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,190
以他玛

700
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,530

是你著名的摩西叔叔

曾是埃及王子
He was once a prince of Egypt.

703
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,770
我没事
I'm fine.

704
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,730
大家都没事
Everybody's fine.

705
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,940
睡的真香啊  我的孩子
You sleep so well, my boy...

706
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,320
因为你知道我们都爱着你
Because you know you are loved.

707
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,320
我就没法睡好
I've never slept so well.

708
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,110
我应该称呼你为
I'm told I should address you...

709
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:29,470
伟大的拉美西斯
As ramses the great, now.

710
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,360
摩西
Moses...

711
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,820
你还活着
You're alive.

712
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,900
-很高兴你还活着  -真的
-I'm glad you're alive.  -Really?

713
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,040
所以你才派了两名杀手来杀我
Is that why you only sent two assassins to kill me?

714
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,990
是我母亲
My mother.

715
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,450
-别怪她  -是她想你死
-Don't blame her. -Yes, she wanted you dead.

716
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,050
你觉得会是谁把剑藏在你能找到的地方
Who do you think hid your sword where you would find it?

717
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,910
摩西
Moses.

718
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,420
我不是来
I'm not here...

夺取你的王位
To take your throne.

720
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,350
也不是关于你很担心的那个预言
It's not about the prophecy that worries you so much.

721
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,520
而是其他事情

722
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,900
有人告诉我
I have been told...

723
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:12,360
这里的情况变得
That things here have become...

724
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,610
更糟了
Much worse.

725
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:18,240
这里的情况从未如此好过  摩西
Things are better than they ever have been, Moses.

726
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,360
不
No.

727
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,910
-我们有秩序  -秩序
-We have order.  -Order?

728
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,120
奴隶们
The slaves...

729
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,170
他们的尸体日夜在燃烧
Their bodies burn night and day now.

730
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,050
我亲眼所见
I've seen it with my own eyes.

731
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,200
你称那是秩序
You call that order?

732
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,370
他们是奴隶
They're slaves.

733
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,840
-不  他们不是  -你觉得是什么
-No, they're not. -What would you expect?

734
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,640
他们是埃及人  像埃及人那样对待他们
They're Egyptians, they should be treated as Egyptians.

735
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,210
他们应享有同样的权利
They should have the same rights...

736
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,890
他们的劳动应该有报酬
They should be paid for their work...

737
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,850
否则你就得放他们走
Or you must set them free.

738
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,350
他们不是埃及人
They are not Egyptians.

739
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,510
摩西  他们是奴隶  你觉得呢
They are slaves, Moses. What else do you expect?

740
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,840
如果像动物那样
They wouldn't know what to do...

741
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,400
让他们自食其力  他们就不知道该怎么办了
If all of a sudden they were left to fend for themselves like animals.

742
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,780
别称他们为动物
Do not call them animals!

743
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,410
从经济角度来看
Listen,from an economic standpoint alone...

744
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:02,910
你的要求
What you're asking...

745
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,410
绝对会产生问题
Is problematic to say the least.

746
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,910
我没指望你直截了说"是"
I didn't expect to hear a simple yes.

747
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,710
但我也不想听你直接说"不"
But I do not want to hear a simple no.

748
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,580
你是在和我说"不"吗
Is that what you are telling me? Are you saying no?

749
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,840
我没有说"不"
I'm not saying no.

750
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,130
我需要时间
I'm saying time.

751
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,590
时间
Time.

752
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,510
你在听从希伯来人
You're listening to hebrews.

753
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:25,710
我没听从希伯来人
I'm not listening to hebrews.

754
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:28,430
那你在和谁交谈
Who are you talking to?

755
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:30,970
上帝
God.

756
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:37,320
上帝
God.

757
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,910
哪位上帝
Which God?

758
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:03,760
你不用认真考虑他的提议
You're not seriously considering his proposal.

759
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,460
那是提议吗
Is it a proposal?

760
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:09,380
如果一个人拿着剑指着你的喉咙
If a man is holding a dagger to your throat, minister?

761
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,840
-它是提议吗  -我说错了
-Is it? -I stand corrected.

762
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,020
那是要求
That's a demand.

763
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,400
他失去理智了
He has lost his mind.

764
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,530
他找到了一位上帝  他的上帝
He's found a God. His God.

765
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,660
而不是我们的上帝
Not one of ours...

766
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,530
所以我想要摩西
So I would like Moses...

767
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,040
我想要摩西死
I want Moses dead.

768
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,380
听懂了吗
Did you hear me?

769
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,340
是的
Yes.

770
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,300
退下吧
Then, go.

771
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:43,670
还有
And...

772
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,060
他的家人
His family, too.

773
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,530
摩西
Moses.

774
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,700
摩西在哪
Where's Moses?

775
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:11,360
摩西  摩西在哪
Moses? Where's Moses?

776
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,620
摩西
Moses...

777
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,410
他的家人
His family.

778
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,800
他们在哪
Where are they?

779
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,060
他不是摩西
This is not Moses.

780
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:29,070
这不是他家人
This is not his family.

781
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,450
他这个男人
This is a man...

782
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,450
他的妻子
His wife...

783
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,570
以及他的孩子
And his child...

784
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,790
他们在被问及"他在哪"这个简单问题时
Who when asked the simple question, "where is he?"...

785
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:45,620
回答了"我们不知道"
Answered, "we don't know."

786
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,140
今晚  带着这一幕回家
Carry this image home with you tonight...

787
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,610
商讨下你们为什么要保护他
And discuss why you would protect him...

788
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,600
记住明天此时
Knowing that tomorrow at this time...

789
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,570
又会有一个家庭
There will be another family...

790
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,980
和他们一样
Where this one is.

791
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:15,360
后天
And another the day after.

792
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,330
再后天
And the day after that.

793
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,840
会不会轮到你家
Dare I say yours?

794
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,010
去吧
Go ahead.

795
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,600
我想参加战斗
I want to join the fight.

796
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,640
进去
In there.

797
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,060
耶和华  你用的膝盖
Joshua, use your knee.

798
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,330
很好
It's good.

799
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,140
双眼睁开
Both eyes open!

800
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,360
搭箭  开弓
Nock! Draw!

801
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,110
射箭
Loose!

802
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:34,190
前进
Advance.

803
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,700
搭箭  开弓
Nock. Draw.

804
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:37,570
射箭
Loose!

805
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,240
开弓
Draw!

806
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,410
射箭
Loose!

807
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,410
开弓
Draw!

808
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,040
射箭
Loose!

809
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,420
再来
Again!

810
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,520
战争分两种
There are two kinds of warfare.

811
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:04,810
每一种跟人数有关
Each is dictated by numbers.

812
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,360
人数多
With greater numbers...

813
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:10,030
你迎头而上进攻
You attack the enemy head on!

814
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:13,160
直击要害
You stab it in the heart!

815
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,200
人数少  就从侧面进攻
With fewer numbers, you come at it from the side.

816
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,200
取其七寸
You cut off the blood...

817
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,160
断其筋脉
That pumps the heart.

818
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,490
切断军火供给
The army supply lines.

819
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:25,750
不
No!

820
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,960
切断人民的供给
The people's supply lines.

821
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,300
他们的食物
Their food...

822
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:30,960
他们的财物
Their property...

823
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,790
他们的安逸
Their comfort.

824
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,090
那会得到什么
What would that achieve?

825
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,850
一切
Everything.

826
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,130
只有埃及人民
Only the Egyptian people...

827
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:41,180
才能逼迫他接受我们
Can force him to accept our demands...

828
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,180
自由的要求  我们必须迫使他们
For freedom. We must force them...

829
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,940
逼迫他同意
To make him say yes!

830
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:48,530
是不是
Yes?

831
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,850
是
Yes!

832
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:50,990
是不是
Yes?

833
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,520
是
Yes!

834
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,030
跟着我
With me!

835
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,290
跟着我
With me!

836
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
准备
Ready.

837
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,890
你不打算想想办法了
You're not going to do anything?

838
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,060
我可没这么说
I didn't say that.

839
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,680
你去哪了
Where have you been?

840
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,070
看你如何失败
Watching you fail.

841
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,730
消耗战需要时间
Wars of attrition take time.

842
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,350
按这速度  你要花上几年
At this rate, you'll take years...

843
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,910
一辈子
A generation.

844
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,730
我准备好打这么久的仗了
I am prepared to fight for that long.

845
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,610
我没有
I'm not.

846
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,600
我想我们有点起色了
I thought we were making progress.

847
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,580
你却不耐烦了
Now, you're impatient.

848
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,500
400年的奴役都过去了
After 400 years of slavery.

849
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:45,260
直到现在  我是唯一无所事事的人吗
Am I the only one sitting here who's done nothing about this until now?

850
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,460
我知道
I do know...

851
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,020
一些军事战术
A few things about military action.

852
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:51,880
如果你不愿听从我
Still, if you're not going to listen to me...

853
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,390
为何你要让我远离
Then why did you take me away...

854
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,930
我的家庭
From my family?

855
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,430
不是我
I didn't.

856
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,530
是你
You did.

857
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,600
你不需要我
ou don't need me.

858
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,770
或许不需要
Maybe not.

859
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,120
那我该怎么办  啥都不干
So what do I do? Nothing?

860
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,290
现在起
For now...

861
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,240
\an8上帝要降下"十灾"
你就看着
You can watch.

862
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:57,640
神圣的凯贝洁特女神  我谦卑的召唤你
Divine goddess kebechet, I humbly call upon you...

863
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,260
来净化我们赖以生存的水域
To purify the waters of our life-giving river.

864
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:17,950
还要多久
How long will it take?

865
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,570
不会太久
Not long.

866
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,750
还要稍微久点
But longer than that.

867
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,650
拉美西斯  拉美西斯
Ramses! Ramses!

868
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,020
什么事
Yes?

869
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,990
够了
Enough!

870
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,640
想想办法
Do something!

871
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,020
他们只是青蛙
They're just frogs.

872
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,700
退后  退后
Back away, back away.

873
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,040
不干净
Unclean.

874
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,540
不  不  不  别喝
No, no, no. Don't drink.

875
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,580
不干净
Unclean.

876
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,700
我都知道  尼罗河携带一定数量的泥土
The nile, as we know, carries a certain amount of Clay.

877
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,210
今年泥土数量异常得多
This year there's much more of it than usual...

878
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,710
漂浮在河流中  沉积在河床上
Drifting in on the currents, settling on the riverbeds...

879
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,460
并被鳄鱼给搅浑了
And kicked up by the wild thrashing of the crocodiles.

880
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,880
这种浑浊
This thrashing not only...

881
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,460
不但大大改变了水的颜色  也污染了水
Dramatically changed the color of the water, but it fouled it...

882
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,560
以至于把鱼杀死了
To the point of killing the fish.

883
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,890
但青蛙  我们都知道
But frogs, as we know...

884
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:29,100
在不得已的情况下  他们会跳出水面
Can get out of the water, when they have to.

885
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,890
现在就这情况
Which they did.

886
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:33,650
但青蛙仍然需要水
But frogs still need water...

887
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:36,450
但是在我们城市的路上找不到水
And when they can't find it in the streets of our city...

888
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,620
它们就怎么样
They what?

889
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,240
它们死了
They die?

890
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,620
它们死了
They die!

891
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,780
然后腐烂
And then they decompose.

892
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,450
然后虱子  蛆和苍蝇都来了
And then the gnats come and the maggots come and the flies come.

893
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:51,450
然后
And then...

894
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,470
然后什么
And then what?

895
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,840
苍蝇会死
The flies die.

896
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,210
快说
Speak up.

897
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,020
在希伯来人那找到的
It's in Hebrew.

898
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,220
希伯来人
Hebrew?

899
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,510
念出来
Read it.

900
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,900
"这些灾难
"These catastrophes...

901
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:52,890
"乃上帝所赐
"Are the work of God...

902
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:55,360
"灾难还没结束  只会变得更糟
"And they have not finished. They will get worse.

903
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,190
"看在彼此份上
"We need to reach a settlement...

904
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:59,810
"我们需要达成协议"
"For both our sakes."

905
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:04,580
上帝所赐
So, the work of God.

906
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,120
我给你们的协议
Here is my settlement to you.

907
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,880
就是工作量翻倍
Work quotas shall be doubled...

908
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,500
不会给你们稻草
And you will get no straw...

909
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,290
来搬运砖块
To make your bricks.

910
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:21,620
或许你们的上帝
Perhaps your God...

911
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:24,040
会提供给你
Will provide it for you.

912
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,750
起初我很感动
I was impressed at first.

913
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,210
现在不是了
Not anymore.

914
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,670
这殃及了所有人
This is affecting everyone.

915
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:04,840
你在惩罚谁
So, who are you punishing?

916
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,560
他怎么了
What's wrong with him?

917
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,320
生病了
It's sick.

918
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,950
这是什么
What is this?

919
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,960
-你干的  -不是我
-Did you do this?  -Not me.

920
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,170
-你干的  -不  不
-Is this you?  -No, no!

921
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,550
它怎么了
What's happened to him?

922
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,370
我们的医疗已有长足进步
We have made great strides in medicine.

923
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:19,180
然而
However,

924
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,690
仍然有一些疾病我们所不了解
there are still a few hidden diseases that we don't completely understand.

925
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,910
动物也不例外
Animals are not exempt...

926
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,540
我猜想
And there is some conjecture...

927
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:31,890
这些瘟病可能来自最小的生物
That these maladies can migrate from the smallest creature.

928
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:32,930
比如
Like a...

929
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:35,190
苍蝇
A fly.

930
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,680
你最近去过河边吗
Have you been out to the river lately?

931
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,350
我再次祈求凯贝洁特女神
I appealed to kebechet again...

932
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:49,200
以及其他六位神灵
And six more gods.

933
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,730
就这些
Is that it?

934
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,720
收手了没
Are you done?

935
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,950
我收手了
I am.

936
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,590
你不出现  是想说明什么
Are you trying to say something with your absence?

937
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:31,340
想羞辱我吗
Is it meant to humble me?

938
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,640
没用的
Because it will not!

939
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,330
初步估计
Initial reports suggest...

940
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:45,880
超过一千万平方公尺的庄稼被毁
More than 10 million square cubits of crops have been lost.

941
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,750
军需官建议我们返一部分粮食
The quartermaster has suggested we return a portion...

942
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:52,040
来补给民用仓库
Of the supplement to the civil granary.

943
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,220
仁善之举
An act of mercy.

944
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,630
你的人民在挨饿
Your people are starving.

945
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:01,730
你想我也挨饿是吗
Are you suggesting that I should starve, too?

946
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:03,390
不
No.

947
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,150
人民有足够的水
People have plenty of water.

948
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,560
他们能忍受住
They will endure.

949
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:48,980
瞄准
Aim!

950
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,230
射箭
Fire!

951
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,110
瞄准
Aim!

952
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,650
射箭
Fire!

953
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:55,130
是你吗
Is that you?

954
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,840
摩西
Moses?

955
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,180
兄弟
Brother?

956
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,520
你是来谈判的
Have you come to negotiate?

957
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,850
我准备好了
Because I'm ready...

958
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:16,360
我给你个条件
As I have an offer for you.

959
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:20,240
这类事情再发生一次
One more thing happens...

960
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:25,490
我也会降我的瘟疫
And I will bring my own plague to you.

961
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:30,120
每个还不会走路的
You see, every Hebrew child...

962
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,030
希伯来孩童
Not yet walking...

963
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,290
将永远没机会走路
They never shall.

964
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:38,790
因为我会把他们淹死在尼罗河
Because I will drown them in the nile.

965
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,180
就像你本该的那样
As you should have been.

966
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,170
你敢说这些不是你造成的
You say that you didn't cause all this?

967
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,900
你的上帝干的
Your God did?

968
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:58,180
我就是上帝  我就是上帝
I am the God! I am the God!

969
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:06,570
让我们瞧瞧谁杀人更有效率
So, let's just see who's more effective at killing.

970
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:09,530
你
You.

971
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,330
你的上帝
This God.

972
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,920
还是我
Or me.

973
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,940
你能来真好
Nice of you to come.

974
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,350
他达到你的要求了吗
He's given you what you asked?

975
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,990
还没有  但他的人民在反对他
Not yet. But his own people are turning against him.

976
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:50,160
-他的军队呢  -也会的
-And his army?  -It will.

977
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,910
我不同意
I disagree.

978
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,570
还要发生更大的灾难
Something worse has to happen.

979
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,920
我不同意
I disagree.

980
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:59,500
-任何灾难将会  -将会怎样
-Anything more would be...  -Would be what?

981
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:00,620
你想说什么
What were you about to say?

982
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:03,250
残忍  不人道
Cruel? Inhumane?

983
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:06,340
这些人和我一起长大
It's not easy to see...

984
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:09,300
看着他们受难很不好受
The people who I grew up with suffering this much.

985
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:11,550
那些没和你一起成长的人们呢
What about the people you didn't grow up with?

986
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,980
你对他们的感受是什么
What thought did you give to them?

987
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,720
你始终觉得他们不是你的人们  对吧
You still don't think of them as yours, do you?

988
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,160
只要拉美西斯还有军队支撑着
As long as ramses has an army behind him...

989
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,850
形势就不会改观
Nothing will change.

990
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,610
任何灾难都是复仇
Anything more is just revenge!

991
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:27,660
复仇  经过400年的残酷镇压
Revenge? After 400 years of brutal subjugation?

992
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:32,380
这些法老幻想着他们是活神仙
These pharaohs who imagine they're living gods,

993
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:34,120
他们不过是肉体凡胎
they're nothing more than flesh and blood.

994
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:38,290
我要他们跪下来求我住手
I want to see them on their knees, begging for it to stop!

995
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:40,830
我受够了和一个信使交谈
I'm tired of talking with a messenger!

996
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,090
将军
General!

997
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:51,130
我听到了拉美西斯最终的威胁
I have heard ramses' final threat.

998
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,480
让我告诉你下来会发生什么
So, let me tell you what's going to happen next.

999
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,930
不  不
No. No.

1000
01:38:58,430 --> 01:39:00,350
你不能那么做
You cannot do this.

1001
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,680
我不想再参合这事
I want no part of this!

1002
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,760
停住
Stay!

1003
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,060
-站住  -摩西
-Hold!  -Moses?

1004
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,260
让他过来
Leave him.

1005
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:46,060
-希安  -摩西
-Khyan. -Moses.

1006
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:03,210
我本可以杀了你
I could have you killed.

1007
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,750
我不这么觉得
I don't think so.

1008
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:09,260
除非你亲自动手
Unless you do it yourself.

1009
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:12,290
你的士兵放我进来的
Your own soldiers let me in.

1010
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,840
我不想再谈判了
I am not negotiating anymore.

1011
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:21,270
我来的目的不是谈判
That's not why I'm here.

1012
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:26,600
我是来告诉你  有事要发生
I came to tell you that something is coming...

1013
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,740
它已经超出我的掌控
That is out of my control.

1014
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:32,910
它会殃及成千上万人
Something that will affect thousands...

1015
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,280
成千上万居民
And thousands of citizens.

1016
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,000
它会影响到你个人
And it will affect you very personally

1017
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,150
除非接受我的要求
unless you accept what I've asked for...

1018
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:42,460
并在太阳落山前
And announce it publicly...

1019
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:46,340
公之于众
Before the sun goes down.

1020
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,170
拉美西斯
Ramses...

1021
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:53,630
别背对我
Do not turn your back on me!

1022
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:00,690
这不是私人恩怨
This has nothing to do with you and I.

1023
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:04,360
远远不是
This is far beyond that.

1024
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,350
这关乎埃及人存亡  懂吗
This is about Egypt's survival. Do you understand?

1025
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:14,990
日落前
Sunset.

1026
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:18,540
否则  就太迟了
After that, it will be too late.

1027
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,110
什么太迟了
What will be too late?

1028
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,380
保护好你的孩子
You protect your child.

1029
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,490
今晚保护好你的孩子
You protect your child tonight.

1030
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:28,840
我的孩子
My child?

1031
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,250
这是威胁吗
Is that a threat?

1032
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:39,850
这是威胁吗  摩西
Is that a threat? Moses!

1033
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,100
摩西
Moses!

1034
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,100
告诉大家
Tell everyone...

1035
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,360
去宰一头羊
To slaughter a lamb...

1036
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:52,520
今晚用羊血
And mark their doors...

1037
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:55,200
在门以及门框上
And their doorposts tonight...

1038
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,030
做标记
With its blood.

1039
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,290
为什么
Why?

1040
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:04,030
如果我错了  就可惜了羊儿
Pity the lambs if I am wrong.

1041
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:08,660
如果我是对的
If I'm right...

1042
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:11,590
我们得祈祷它们得到永生
We will bless them for eternity.

1043
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,230
本奴  本奴
Bennu? Bennu?

1044
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,400
不
No!

1045
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,410
拉美西斯
Ramses?

1046
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:33,450
拉美西斯
Ramses.

1047
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,080
拉美西斯
Ramses.

1048
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:56,940
不
No!

1049
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,780
撒迦利亚
Zechariah?

1050
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,950
撒迦利亚
Zechariah?

1051
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,150
跪下
Kneel!

1052
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:13,390
出去
Get out!

1053
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:15,770
凶手
Murderer!

1054
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:18,440
孩童杀手
Child killer!

1055
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,860
他们的孩子昨晚死了
Their children died last night.

1056
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:35,870
我的孩子也是
As did mine.

1057
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:42,840
是你的上帝干的
Is this your God?

1058
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,870
孩童杀手
A killer of children?

1059
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:52,380
什么样的上帝会有如此"杰作"
What kind of fanatics worship such a God?

1060
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:02,220
昨晚希伯来孩童没一个死的
No Hebrew child died last night.

1061
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:23,840
滚
Get...

1062
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:25,760
滚出去
Out.

1063
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:28,720
走
Go.

1064
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,720
你们每个人
Every one of you!

1065
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,260
滚
Go!

1066
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,930
回到你们梦想的迦南去吧
Go to canaan if that's what you want.

1067
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,850
回到你们梦中的故土
Back to the homeland of your dreams.

1068
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:44,440
滚吧
But go!

1069
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:49,860
听从你的命令
As you command.

1070
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:04,500
这是我走过的路
This is the route I took.

1071
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:07,380
从这里  我们往南去红海
From here, we go South to the red sea.

1072
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:10,010
海峡在这  有点潮水  但能步行穿过
The straits are here. At low tide, we can cross on foot.

1073
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:51,690
知道为什么你能睡这么香吗  我的孩子
You know why you sleep so well, my boy?

1074
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:56,400
因为你知道我们都爱你
Because you know you are loved.

1075
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:50,250
恕我直言
With respect...

1076
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:53,050
如果我们不抓个40万奴隶回来
If we're going to recapture 400,000 slaves...

1077
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,750
我们就需要超过3个师的人
We might need more than three divisions.

1078
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:58,290
我们不抓任何奴隶
We're not recapturing anyone.

1079
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:03,340
前进
Forward!

1080
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:43,670
我们应该休息
We should rest.

1081
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,970
不
No.

1082
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:48,130
到了红海才安全
We're not safe until we cross the sea.

1083
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,360
摩西
Moshe!

1084
01:52:56,730 --> 01:52:58,390
拉美西斯
Ramses...

1085
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,520
带着4000人
4,000 men...

1086
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,150
一千辆马车
A thousand chariots.

1087
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:02,480
离我们多远
How far behind us?

1088
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:04,330
4天路程
Four days.

1089
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,280
要是他们马不停蹄  不到4天
Less, if they don't rest the horses.

1090
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,090
拉美西斯
Ramses!

1091
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,370
拉美西斯
Ramses!

1092
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,910
马需要歇息
We need to rest the horses...

1093
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,500
士兵们也是
And the men!

1094
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:35,430
海峡在那条路
The straits are that way.

1095
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:38,360
最长  最好走的路
The longest, easiest route...

1096
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,030
在西海岸
Is down the Western coast.

1097
01:53:42,570 --> 01:53:46,330
或者我们穿过山脉
Or we go through the mountains.

1098
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:49,250
穿过山脉
The mountains?

1099
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,860
为什么  为什么不走那条路
Why? Why don't we take that route?

1100
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,410
我们可以  拉美西斯也可以
We can, but so can ramses.

1101
01:53:56,290 --> 01:53:58,380
山路险峻
The Mountain passes are dangerous...

1102
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:01,840
但对于拉美西斯的马车来说太窄
But they are too narrow for ramses' chariots.

1103
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,510
他追不上  能给我们争取点时间
He couldn't follow. That would give us needed time.

1104
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:07,590
上帝和你怎么说
What does God tell you?

1105
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:15,230
走山路
The mountains.

1106
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:18,570
能成功吗
Can we make it?

1107
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:26,070
前进
Forward!

1108
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:08,900
走哪条路
Which way from here?

1109
01:55:12,450 --> 01:55:13,710
待在这
Stay here.

1110
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:36,800
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

1111
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:46,610
我不知道身在何方
I don't know where I am.

1112
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,720
你不帮我
You won't help me?

1113
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,630
你不帮我
You won't help them.

1114
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:23,820
这条路
This way!

1115
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,400
出发
Move out!

1116
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,880
这条路
This way!

1117
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,430
你确定
Are you sure?

1118
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:56,210
非常确定
I'm very sure.

1119
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,880
凭我们的装备  你确定我们能翻过山
I mean, are you sure we can make it across with our equipment...

1120
01:56:58,930 --> 01:57:00,510
我们的马车呢
Our chariots?

1121
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:02,570
他们都不觉得他们的装备能翻过去
They didn't think they could with theirs.

1122
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:06,320
他们如何知道
How would they know?

1123
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,570
他们又没走过那里
They've never been here.

1124
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:10,160
摩西或许知道
Moses may have.

1125
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:54,070
涨潮还是退潮
Is this high tide or low tide?

1126
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:55,690
没关系
Doesn't matter.

1127
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:58,740
这不是海峡  对吧
This isn't the straits, is it?

1128
01:57:58,780 --> 01:57:59,780
不是
No.

1129
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,420
你知道我们在哪吗
Do you even know where we are?

1130
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,160
是的
Yes!

1131
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:09,510
我们正在某个地方  前有大海
We're at a point on the earth where there is a sea ahead...

1132
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,290
后有追兵
And an army behind!

1133
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,220
现在怎么办
So now what?

1134
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,300
不管有没追兵
Army or no army...

1135
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,220
我们都要休息
We have to rest.

1136
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,110
我误导了所有人
I have misled all of them.

1137
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:47,750
我抛家弃子
I have abandoned my family.

1138
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:50,920
却辜负了你
I have failed you.

1139
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:59,010
我并不是自认为的那样
I'm not what I thought I was.

1140
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,220
那是什么
What is it?

1141
02:01:57,730 --> 02:01:59,400
洋流
The current.

1142
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:04,190
水流很急
It's strong.

1143
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:13,750
我们要涉过去
We need to cross here.

1144
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:19,420
现在就涉过去
We need to cross now!

1145
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:25,170
我们从这过去
We cross here.

1146
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,550
我们从这过去
We cross here!

1147
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,460
大家准备
Ready yourselves!

1148
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,630
我们从这过去
We cross here!

1149
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:33,590
快去告诉他们  去
Go tell them! Go!

1150
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,720
你的命令
Your orders...

1151
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:37,690
就像是埃及人的皮鞭
Are like the lash of the Egyptian whip.

1152
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:41,100
我们不再是奴隶
We are no longer slaves.

1153
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:43,520
你们尚未自由
And yet, you are not free.

1154
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:46,070
你看不到
You have lost sight...

1155
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:47,990
你们先祖之地
Of canaan...

1156
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:50,900
迦南
Land of your forebears.

1157
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:54,570
你们赐予我信任
You have honored me...

1158
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:57,120
我深感荣幸
With your trust.

1159
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,090
现在我赐予你们我的信仰
Now I honor you with my faith.

1160
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,000
跟随我  你们终将自由
Follow me and you will be free!

1161
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:09,090
留下则会灭亡
Stay and you will perish.

1162
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:13,350
不用害怕
Do not be afraid!

1163
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:16,560
上帝与我们同在
God is with us!

1164
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:18,820
走  大家准备

上帝与我们同在
God is with us!

1167
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:26,600
传话出去  我们从这过去
Pass the word! We cross here!

1168
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:29,230
尽快收拾好你们的东西
As quickly as you can, gather your things...

1169
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:31,230
站成一队

1174

继续前进
Keep moving!

1175
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,880
没什么好害怕的
There's nothing to fear!

1176
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,940
别担心  你们很安全
Don't worry! You'll be safe!

1177
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:46,620
靠右  靠右
Keep to the right! Keep to the right!

1178
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,420
拉美西斯
Ramses!

1179
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:27,330
停
Stop!

1180
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:53,100
停  停
Stop! Stop!

1181
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:13,090
走
Go.

1182
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:16,720
继续前进
Keep moving!

1183
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:19,670
继续前进  前进
Keep moving! Forward!

1184
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,160
那里
There.

1185
02:08:12,190 --> 02:08:13,190
耶和华
Joshua!

1186
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:15,200
亚伦
Aaron!

1187
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:31,880
跑
Run!

1188
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,210
大家跑啊
Everyone, run!

1189
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:34,830
跑
Move!

1190
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:36,380
跑到海边
Run to shore!

1191
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,760
摩西
Moshe.

1192
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,410
摩西
Moshe.

1193
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,740
我们必须离开
We must leave!

1194
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,330
拉美西斯
Ramses!

1195
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:41,090
拉美西斯
Ramses!

1196
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,420
冲
Go!

1197
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:49,100
拉美西斯  停
Ramses, stop!

1198
02:10:56,810 --> 02:11:00,100
所有人  掉头
All! Turn around!

1199
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:02,900
掉头
Turn around!

1200
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:04,850
锡安
Khyan!

1201
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:13,080
离开
Leave.

1202
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:14,360
弟弟
Brother...

1203
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:16,320
马上离开  这是命令
Leave now! That's an order!

1204
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:44,480
来呀  你回不了头了
Come! You'll never make it back!

1205
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:04,550
冲
Go!

1206
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:12,890
快
Faster!

1207
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:34,770
这只有我
It's just me here.

1208
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:44,820
坐
Sit.

1209
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:53,720
我的家里
My family...

1210
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,300
离这不远
Is not far from here.

1211
02:14:55,340 --> 02:14:56,340
你的家人
Your family?

1212
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:58,840
我另外个家  我妻子和孩子
My other family. My wife, my son.

1213
02:15:00,350 --> 02:15:02,270
我在想
I was thinking...

1214
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:04,770
或许我能说服他们
Maybe I could convince them...

1215
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,190
说服他们加入我们  但或许
Convince them to join us, but perhaps that's...

1216
02:15:09,730 --> 02:15:10,940
那不是明智之举
Perhaps that's not wise.

1217
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:13,020
他们当然应该过来
Of course they should come.

1218
02:15:13,070 --> 02:15:14,530
我们还有很长的路要走
We have a long way to go.

1219
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:16,610
路长梦多
A lot can happen.

1220
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:18,610
如果
And then...

1221
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:21,450
如果我们到了那
We get there, if we get there.

1222
02:15:21,490 --> 02:15:23,370
你觉得他们会让我们定居在迦南吗
You don't think they'll let us settle in canaan?

1223
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:26,370
他们会视我们为入侵者
They'll see us as invaders.

1224
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:30,410
他们别无选择  我们比任何部落的人都多
They won't have a choice. We're as big as any tribe.

1225
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:33,060
我们的人数可以匹敌一个国家  反倒让我更担心
We're as big as a nation of tribes and that concerns me even more.

1226
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:34,750
为什么
Why?

1227
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:38,420
这么多人
This many people?

1228
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:40,520
你还用问
You have to ask?

1229
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:44,940
但我们目标一致
But we all have the same goal.

1230
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:46,010
现在是
We do now.

1231
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:49,520
但不再逃亡以后呢
What happens when we stop running?

1232
02:16:14,210 --> 02:16:15,620
伟大的
Ramses...

1233
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:19,210
拉美西斯
The great.

1234
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,390
谢谢
Thank you.

1235
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,210
革舜
Gershom.

1236
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:50,930
你按你说的做了吗
Did you do what you said?

1237
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:54,010
我说什么了
What did I say?

1238
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:58,030
你愿意牺牲你的信仰
That you would trade your faith...

1239
02:17:59,570 --> 02:18:01,030
来维护我的信仰
To keep me.

1240
02:18:02,030 --> 02:18:03,530
没有
No.

1241
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:08,190
很好
Good.

1242
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:11,280
现在你更需要坚信你的信仰
You may need it more than ever now.

1243
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:26,210
他们是谁
Who are they?

1244
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,050
他们是我的人民
They're my people.

1245
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:39,890
是谁让你幸福
Who makes you happy?

1246
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:43,310
你啊
You do.

1247
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:47,650
你生命中什么最重要
What is the most important thing in your life?

1248
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:50,400
你啊
You are.

1249
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:52,610
你啊
You are.

1250
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:58,410
你何时离我而去
When will I leave you?

1251
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,750
永远不会
Never.

1252
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,020
我能继续吗
May I proceed?

1253
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:13,690
继续吧
Proceed.

1254
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,110
你觉得这个怎么样
What do you think of this?

1255
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:42,650
要是不同意
I wouldn't do it...

1256
02:20:42,690 --> 02:20:44,280
我也不会这么做
If I didn't agree.

1257
02:20:46,190 --> 02:20:47,940
没错
That's true.

1258
02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:50,570
我注意到你
I've noticed that about you.

1259
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:53,950
并不总能同意我
You don't always agree with me.

1260
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:58,030
我注意到  你也是
Nor you me, I've noticed.

1261
02:20:58,540 --> 02:21:01,960
但我们仍在这  说着话
Yet here we are, still speaking.

1262
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:04,380
可惜说不了太久
But not for much longer.

1263
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:10,090
领袖会更迭
A leader can falter...

1264
02:21:10,130 --> 02:21:11,540
但石头
But stone...

1265
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:14,430
永不腐朽
Will endure.

1266
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:17,220
这些法律会代替你引领他们
These laws will guide them in your stead.

1267
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:21,640
如果你不同意
If you disagree...

1268
02:21:22,230 --> 02:21:24,610
就该把锤子放下
You should put down the hammer.
