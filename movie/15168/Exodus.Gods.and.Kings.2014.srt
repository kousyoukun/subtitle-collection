\an8公元前1300年

5
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,710
\an8過去400年  希伯來人飽受埃及人奴役

6
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,710
\an8為埃及造就了雕像  城市以及榮耀

7
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,510
\an8但是他們從未忘記過自己的故鄉

8
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,510
\an8以及他們的神

9
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,510
\an8神也從未忘記他們

10
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,510
法老與眾神

11
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,290
希泰人在卡疊什城外駐紮了16000人的部隊
It's true, the hittite army has 16,000 troops camped outside Kadesh.

12
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,470
他們的目的是什麼
What's less clear is why.

13
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,600
希泰人想要跨越邊境
The hittites are trying to cross the border.

14
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,090
顯而易見
Obviously.

15
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,230
他們還想幹嘛呢  
What else would they be doing?

16
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,570
根據我們的情報  他們期盼我們進攻
Anticipating an invasion by us, according to our information.

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,220
他們以為我們  
They think we are...

18
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,940
已然備戰  但我們沒有
Preparing an attack, which we are not.

19
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,480
我不想  也不願意坐在這  
What I don't want to do, and won't do, is sit here...

20
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,160
乾等著希泰軍隊  
And wait until we're fighting hittite armies...

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,450
兵臨城下
Outside the palace walls.

22
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,950
來吧
Come.

23
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,880
內臟都說些什麼  
What do the entrails say?

24
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,300
內臟不會說話
They don't "say" anything.

25
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,970
它們只會暗示
They imply.

26
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,370
然後去解釋暗示
And that's open to interpretation.

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
那就解釋吧
So, interpret them.

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,380
我們能否先發制人贏得戰爭  
We'll win or we won't in a preemptive attack?

29
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,390
能還是不能
It's a yes or a no.

30
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,900
尚不清楚
And it's not clear.

31
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,070
但能知道一個預言
But something else is.

32
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,690
戰爭中  一位首領會得救  
In the battle, a leader will be saved...

33
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,740
救他的人某天會統治國家
And his savior will someday lead.

34
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,580
內臟或許應該說  
Then the entrails should also say...

35
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,580
我們應該放棄理智  
That we will abandon reason...

36
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,380
讓預言來引領我們
And be guided by omens.

37
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,170
偉大的賽克邁特
Great sekhmet...

38
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,170
\an8埃及獅頭女神

39
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,800
以你的名義  法老作飲
Pharaoh drinks in your name...

40
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,020
並祈禱卡疊什一戰挫敗希泰人
And prays for victory over the hittites at Kadesh.

41
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,980
時機一旦成熟  你就廢了她
Your first order of business when the time comes, you retire her.

42
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,490
我會的
I will.

43
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,450
真不懂我父親為什麼沒廢了她
I don't know why my father hasn't.

44
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,450
只是  萬一  
But, just in case...

45
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,820
我身處險境  你就從其他路逃走
If you see me in any real danger out there, ride the other way.

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,170
我是認真的
I'm serious.

47
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,630
當我看著你  就像看到兩個  
When I look at you, I still see the two boys...

48
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,340
共同成長的孩子  親如手足
Who grew up together, close as brothers.

49
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,130
如果有什麼原因  
If, for any reason...

50
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,590
讓你們忘記這點  
You ever forget that...

51
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,680
讓這個提醒你們
Let these remind you.

52
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,640
長度足夠在馬背上攻擊  
Long enough to be effective from horseback...

53
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,510
卻又不會讓你拔不出來
Not so long that you trip over them.

54
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,810
這把是他的  我的在你那
This is his. You've got mine.

55
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,480
沒錯  我就是這麼安排的
That's right. That's how I want it.

56
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,690
你們彼此擁有  
You have each other's...

57
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,810
保證對方安全
To keep each other safe.

58
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,370
答應我你們會做到  
Promise me you'll do that...

59
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,530
直到永遠
Always.

60
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,670
賽提  賽提  賽提  
SETI! SETI! SETI!

61
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,260
賽提  
SETI!

62
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
在那  
There!

63
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,260
把阿蒙隊部署在背面  瑞隊去中部  
Deploy amun division to the north, ra division to the center...

64
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,650
卜塔隊去南面  我們帶領賽思隊做後備
And ptah to the South. And we hold Seth in reserve.

65
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,680
-後備  -是的
-In reserve?  -Yes.

66
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,690
我們應該集中兵力在中部
We should concentrate our strength in the center.

67
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,700
你應該集中兵力去戰鬥
You should concentrate yours on fighting.

68
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,700
我來指揮
Leave the generalship to me.

69
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,190
射箭  
Fire!

70
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,910
射箭  
Fire!

71
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,430
衝啊  
Charge!

72
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,090
帶走拉美西斯  走  
Take ramses! Go!

73
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,850
走  
Go!

74
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,110
掉頭  掉頭  
Turn around! Turn around!

75
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,120
摩西  摩西  摩西  
Moses! Moses! Moses!

76
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,340
摩西
Moses.

77
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
那裡發生了什麼  
What happened out there?

78
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
沒什麼
Nothing.

79
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,280
我問了指揮官同樣的問題  他們和我撒謊
I asked the commanders the same thing. They, too, lied.

80
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
我受夠了
And I'm tired of it.

81
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,530
您以為有事發生
He thinks something happened.

82
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,320
-其實沒有  -什麼意思  
-But it didn't.   -Meaning?

83
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,150
高階牧師  預言家
The high priestess, her prophecy.

84
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,320
她說她看不到誰贏
She said she couldn't see who would win.

85
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,840
卻看到了"首領會得救"
The other one.  "The leader will be saved..."

86
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,290
之類的
And so on.

87
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,000
你救了我兒的命  
You saved my son's life?

88
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,510
是的
Yes.

89
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,850
坐下
Sit.

90
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,840
"謝謝"一句遠遠不夠
"Thank you" is not sufficient...

91
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,690
但是謝謝你
But thank you.

92
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,970
我知道你不相信預言之類  
I know you don't believe  in omens or prophecies...

93
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,020
但我相信
But I do believe.

94
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,890
這我很敬重
And I respect that.

95
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,700
但這又如何
But this isn't anything.

96
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,200
我救了他也無任何意義
This doesn't even make any sense.

97
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,870
因為你不是我的血脈
Because you're not my blood.

98
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,320
是的
Yes.

99
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,030
你無法繼承我的王位
It's true, you can't succeed me.

100
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,620
按常理不能
Not in the usual way.

101
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,210
無論如何都不能
Not in any way.

102
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,380
光坐這想肯定不能
In any way imaginable, sitting here.

103
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,710
這麼說親生兒子不應該  
It's horrible to say this about one's own son...

104
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,220
但我相信你比他更適合領導
But I trust you more than him to lead.

105
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
"希泰人的馬車  
"The hittite chariotry...

106
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,440
"粉碎了我們的放手並開始進攻
"Crashed through our defense and began its attack.

107
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,570
"我發現自己被敵人包圍"
I found myself surrounded by the enemy...

108
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,030
"沒有衛兵  沒有盾牌  
"No soldier, no shield-bearer...

109
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,580
"獨自面對激戰
"Facing a desperate fight for my life.

110
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,730
"依賴上帝的幫助  
"Only with the help of the gods...

111
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,370
"我擊潰了我們的敵軍  
"Did I defeat our attackers...

112
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,670
"與瑞隊會合"
"And rejoin ra division."

113
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,240
打住
Stop there.

114
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,800
有什麼你想改撰的嗎  
Anything you'd like to rephrase?

115
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,130
沒有
No.

116
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,050
-我能繼續嗎  -不用了  相信剩餘情節沒問題
-Shall I go on?  -No, I'm sure the rest is fine.

117
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,430
下來何事  
What's next?

118
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,720
比東
Pithom.

119
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,890
怎麼了  
What about it?

120
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,640
那的形勢  以及奴隸
The situation. The slaves.

121
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,600
好的  拉美西斯
Fine. Ramses.

122
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,520
什麼  
What?

123
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,440
去那  和總督會面  觀察情況並報告給我
Go up there, meet with the viceroy,  look around, make a report.

124
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,030
我  
Me?

125
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,100
那裡終究屬於你  長點興趣吧
It will be yours someday. Take an interest in it.

126
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,270
還有何事  
What else?

127
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,240
我去見總督吧
I'll go to see the viceroy.

128
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,590
不
No.

129
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
我去見他
I'll go.

130
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,210
這事不值得你去做
It's beneath you.

131
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,460
這事不值得任何將軍去做
It's beneath any general.

132
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,970
我去吧
I'll do it.

133
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
拉美西斯  
Ramses...

134
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,100
戰場上發生的事情  
Can we forget what happened...

135
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,060
我們忘掉它好嗎  
On the battlefield?

136
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,270
如果換做是我  
If our positions had been reversed...

137
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,150
我也會救你的
I would've saved your life, too.

138
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,110
我知道
I know. I know.

139
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,330
抓的很準啊
It was a good shot.

140
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,670
即使上帝指引著你的目標
Even if the gods did guide your aim.

141
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,180
血液裡有點毒液是好事
A little venom in your blood is a good thing.

142
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,090
可以讓你抵擋住下一次有毒的攻擊
Makes you less vulnerable to the next poisonous bite.

143
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,130
甚至可以抵擋我父親
Maybe even my father's.

144
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,130
\an8比東

145
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,550
歡迎來到比東
Welcome to pithom.

146
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,390
你得習慣這的味道
You get used to the smell.

147
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,580
總督似乎挺享受他在這的安逸生活
The viceroy seems to be enjoying a good share of his resources.

148
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,340
這裡的差事可不是誰都想幹的  我的主人
This isn't a job everyone wants to do, my lord.

149
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,540
為了保持他的幹勁  些許舒適安逸是有必要的
A certain degree of comfort is necessary to keep up his spirits.

150
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,460
你到問題所在麼  這年頭人活的太長
You know what the problem is? People live too long these days.

151
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,660
每年  死亡率遠低於出生率
Every year, the death rate lags further behind the birth rate.

152
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,940
這些人  
And these people...

153
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,850
他們把生育當成運動一樣
They reproduce like it's a sport.

154
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,350
增長的勞動力是個問題  
This is the problem? A growing work force?

155
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,030
當然不是了  生育是件好事
No, of course not. It's good for production.

156
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,570
當然是好事  問題是
Of course it is, but only to a point.

157
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,110
當眾人想要你死  
When that population wants you dead...

158
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,080
這就會是問題
Yes, it's a problem.

159
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,780
所以  要麼給我更多的軍隊維持秩序  
So, either I'm given more troops to maintain order...

160
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,460
要麼我開始縮減人口
Or I start thinning out the herd.

161
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,630
就因為這個荒謬的理論  
You start slaughtering people...

162
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,590
你就想屠殺人民
For no reason other than this precarious theory...

163
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,640
你期望避免的事  恰恰會是你惹出來的
You will provoke the very thing you say you wish to avoid.

164
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,460
行啊  那就給我軍隊
Fine, then give me the troops.

165
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,770
我們下去和他們聊聊
Let's go down and talk to them.

166
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,970
為什麼呢  
Why on earth?

167
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,470
你擔心叛亂  那我們看看你的擔心是否屬實
You're worried about sedition. Let's find out if that worry is real.

168
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,770
通過和他們聊聊  
By talking to them?

169
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,110
通過和他們聊時  
By looking at them...

170
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,570
我觀察他們
When I talk with them.

171
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,280
通過注視人的眼睛
You can tell a lot about somebody...

172
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,990
你能看出很多東西
Looking him in the eye.

173
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,660
我很瞭解這些
Let me tell you something...

174
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,330
希伯來人
About hebrews.

175
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,160
他們陰險  好鬥
They are a conniving, combative people.

176
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,460
知道在他們的語言裡  
Do you know what "israelite" means...

177
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,710
"以色列"是什麼意思  
In their own language?

178
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,130
"與上帝鬥爭之人"
"He who fights with God."

179
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,630
"與上帝角逐之人"
"He who wrestles with God."

180
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,290
兩者有區別
There is a difference.

181
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,810
或許我沒你有文化  
I may not be as educated as you, which, 

182
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,520
顯然  你想提醒我這點
apparently, you want to remind me of.

183
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,640
但我每天都要應付他們
But I have to deal with them every day.

184
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,220
我清楚自己在說什麼
I know what I'm talking about.

185
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,650
你不用去  我自己下去
You don't have to come. I'll go down there myself.

186
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,970
住手  
Stop!

187
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,150
他為何受懲罰  
Why is he being punished?

188
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,230
他老搗蛋  我的主人
Persistent troublemaker, my lord.

189
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,690
他為何在笑  
Why is he smiling?

190
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
他說他沒痛覺  我的主人
He says he feels no pain, my lord.

191
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,870
那何必鞭打他  
Then why whip him?

192
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,800
不是隨機召集你們來的
You were not gathered up at random.

193
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
我要求見見  
I asked to see...

194
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,590
年長者
The elders.

195
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,050
快告訴我  你們祈求什麼  
Come on. What do you pray for?

196
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,390
我們祈求再見到迦南
We pray to see canaan again.

197
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,390
\an8巴勒斯坦  敘利亞和黎巴嫩等地的古稱

198
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,560
再見到迦南  
Canaan again?

199
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,810
你們從給見過它
You've never seen it.

200
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,810
我見過迦南
I've seen canaan.

201
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,560
比印度軍隊更殘暴的一些部落佔據著它
I've seen that it's inhabited by tribes fiercer than Egypt's military.

202
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,220
所以  你們回不到那了  
So, you won't be returning to it...

203
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,640
假如你們真的打那來
Or, if you do, from it.

204
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,570
-上帝不這麼說  -哪位上帝  
-God says otherwise. -Which God?

205
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,910
你們的上帝  亞伯拉罕上帝  
Your God? The God of Abraham?

206
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,730
說你們是特殊之群的上帝  
The God that says that you are special?

207
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,910
說你們是天選之人  
That you are chosen?

208
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,290
過來  來
Come here. Up.

209
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,440
過來
Come here.

210
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
你們的上帝是錯的
He's wrong.

211
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,510
看得出你堅信不疑  這可是個問題
I can see you're unconvinced, and that's a problem.

212
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,830
因為不切實際的信仰下來是盲信  
Because next to unrealistic belief lies fanaticism...

213
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,210
接著是叛亂  接著就是革命
And next to that, sedition, and next to that, revolution.

214
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,970
這一切起源於年長者
And it all starts with the elders.

215
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,020
你叫什麼名字  
What's your name?

216
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,090
你叫什麼  
What's yours?

217
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,730
我會告訴你
I'll tell you.

218
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,360
我叫摩西  比西亞之子
I am Moses, son of bithia...

219
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,140
霍倫赫布之孫
Grandson of horemheb.

220
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,410
記下此人和其他人的姓名
Record this one's name and the rest of them.

221
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,360
把下一組人帶上來
Bring in the next group.

222
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,540
我名叫努恩
My name is nun.

223
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
我的主人  
My lord!

224
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,500
-站住  -放他進來
-Stop there!  -Let him through.

225
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,840
年長者有話要說
There's something the elder has to tell you.

226
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,510
這裡不方便
But not here.

227
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,630
告訴我何時何地
Say where and when.

228
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,250
今晚  禱告屋
The prayer house, tonight.

229
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,840
拿著
Here.

230
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,280
你活著回來了
I see you've survived your adventure.

231
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,030
抱歉又讓你等
Sorry to make you wait again.

232
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,770
沒在等你
I'm not waiting.

233
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,660
-採石場之行如何  -挺好
-How was your trip to the quarry?  -Fine.

234
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,810
你見到了我在應對的
You saw what I'm up against.

235
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
告訴我  
Tell me...

236
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,160
在我離開前  還有什麼記錄需要我提供給你  
Is there any more of my records I could get for you before you leave?

237
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,490
你能否告訴我  
You can tell me...

238
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,630
這一切是否匯報給孟斐斯  
Has all of this been reported to Memphis?

239
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,090
是否被批準  是否有書面記錄  
Was it approved? Do you have it in writing?

240
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,420
當然  都記錄下來了
Of course. It's on record.

241
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,920
介意我們查看下嗎  
So you don't mind if we check?

242
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,640
當然不介意
Of course I don't mind.

243
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,930
但不理解到底怎麼了
But I don't understand what's gone wrong.

244
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,020
我做了什麼讓你不開心的事  
Have I done something to displease you?

245
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,270
如果是  如何才能讓你開心  
And if so, is there any way I could please you?

246
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,810
別過國王般的日子
You can stop living like a king.

247
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,070
你不是國王
You're not one.

248
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,790
"你會重新佔領迦南"
"...and you will occupy the land of canaan."

249
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,420
迦南已被佔領
Canaan is already occupied.

250
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,670
上帝允諾我們能回去
God promises we will return.

251
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,970
作為囚徒還是死人  
In chains or in coffins?

252
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,420
作為自由人  
As free men...

253
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,000
去往淌著牛奶和蜂蜜的土地
Into a land flowing with milk and honey.

254
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,770
他們能在外等著嗎  我們並不危險
Can they at least wait outside? We're not dangerous.

255
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,320
去馬那等著
Wait by the horses.

256
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,280
你相信巧合嗎  
Do you believe in coincidence?

257
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,270
完全相信
As much as anything else.

258
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,200
我認為這次不是巧合
I don't think this is one.

259
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,530
什麼不是巧合  
What isn't?

260
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,240
你來比東
You coming to pithom.

261
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,450
你為何而來  
Why did you come?

262
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,610
生意  
Business.

263
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
坐
Sit.

264
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
你父親是誰  
Who's your father?

265
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,140
知道你說不出他的名字  
I know you don't know his name...

266
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,140
只知道他是法老軍隊的一名將軍
Only that he was a general in pharaoh's army...

267
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,430
你母親從未說起過他名字
Unnamed by your mother.

268
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,720
看得出這話題讓你不爽
I can see this is making you uncomfortable.

269
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,280
這事你會感興趣
This will interest you.

270
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,950
沒有什麼將軍
There was no general.

271
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,520
你母親  
Your mother...

272
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,740
你喊做母親的女人  沒有孩子
The woman you call your mother, has no children.

273
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,200
你一出生就是奴隸
You were born a slave.

274
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,120
別走  別走
Don't go. Don't go.

275
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,920
我走是為你好
It's better for you that I do.

276
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
我走了
I'm leaving.

277
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,130
現在你走了  還是會回來的  
If you leave now, you'll just come back...

278
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,830
因為你知道有些事不對勁  你一直有這感覺
Because you know something's wrong. You've always felt it.

279
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,050
拜託
Please.

280
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,390
所有人出去
Everybody out.

281
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,350
出去
Out.

282
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,200
你出生那年  
The year of your birth...

283
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,690
有預言說會我們的領袖將誕生  
There was a prophecy that our leader would be born...

284
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,700
來救我們於水火之中
To liberate us from our bondage.

285
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,370
因此  孟斐斯就下詔書  
And so, there was an edict from Memphis...

286
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,830
命令殺害每個希伯來新生兒
To kill every firstborn Hebrew boy.

287
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,750
你父母不想讓這事發生
Your parents didn't wait for that to happen.

288
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,670
任何你活命的辦法都好過沒有辦法
Any chance of your survival was better than no chance.

289
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,330
他們把你交給了你姐
They handed you to your sister.

290
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,380
她把你放籃子裡  帶到了河邊
She took you in a basket to the banks of the river...

291
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,560
把你漂到了只有她知道的地方  
And she floated you to where she knew...

292
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,900
法老帕拉美西的女兒  比西亞
Pharaoh paramesse's daughter, bithia, bathed.

293
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,740
比西亞收留了你和你姐  僕人米裡亞姆
Bithia took you and your sister, Miriam, as a maid...

294
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,810
把你們當成親生的來撫養
And raised you as her own.

295
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,910
她很愛你  
She probably even loved you...

296
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,610
但從沒告訴任何人真相  包括你
But she never told you, or anyone else, the truth.

297
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,940
你是希伯來人
You are Hebrew.

298
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,110
這是真相  
The truth?

299
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,410
真相是  這都算不上一個好故事
The truth is, it's not even that good a story.

300
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,870
你們這些人都擅長  
And I thought you people were meant to be...

301
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,050
說故事
Good storytellers.

302
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,150
喂  奴隸
You, slave.

303
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,650
喂  
You!

304
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,070
想要為這個情報領賞嗎  
Do you expect a reward for this information?

305
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,040
能服務於你就是我們的獎賞
Our reward is being of service to you.

306
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,130
當然了  如果  
That said, if there were...

307
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,410
你有比這更好的獎賞  
Some token you had in mind beyond that...

308
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,340
我們也不會拒絕的
We wouldn't refuse it.

309
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,180
那這個獎賞如何  
How about this, then?

310
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,250
我不殺你們  如何  
What about if I don't kill you?

311
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,220
這就足夠了
That would be sufficient payment.

312
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,100
你們這幫人
You people.

313
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,440
請退下
Please leave.

314
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,150
請
Please.

315
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
情況如何  
How did it go?

316
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,910
下次再談這事吧
We can talk about that another time.

317
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,450
現在就談
We can talk about it now...

318
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,570
好讓我在苦瓜臉軍醫的照料下喘息會
If only as a respite from this army of grim-faced physicians.

319
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,460
坐
Sit.

320
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,140
我自己看了下市政記錄  
We're taking a thorough look at the city records...

321
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,890
顯然總督是個賊
And the man is clearly a thief.

322
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,600
真是人生莫大的諷刺啊
It's one of life's more depressing ironies...

323
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,440
一個渴望權力之人
That the men who crave power...

324
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,810
最適合當權之人  確是最不善用權力之人
Are best fitted to acquire it, and least fitted to exercise it.

325
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,660
怎麼了  摩西  
What's wrong, Moses?

326
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,820
你病了
You're sick.

327
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,660
有事困擾著你
Something else is troubling you.

328
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,500
我看得出來
I can tell.

329
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,830
沒有  沒什麼事
No, nothing else.

330
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,860
願你時刻警惕  
May you be alert...

331
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,350
得重生並受上帝庇佑  
Rejuvenated and protected by the gods...

332
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,680
與世長存
Every moment of your eternal life.

333
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,530
往左
And to the left.

334
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,710
不  你的左邊
No, your left.

335
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,250
再過去點
More, more, more.

336
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,580
很好
Good.

337
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,590
它很高啊
It is tall.

338
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,970
紀念碑就是紀念碑  
Monuments are monuments...

339
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,390
因為它們能做紀念
For a reason. They inspire.

340
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,890
這紀念碑紀念什麼  
Inspire what, in this case?

341
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,390
紀念一切權力
In this, and in every case, power.

342
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,760
不管是什麼  大聲說出來吧
Say it out loud, whatever it is.

343
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,400
比東的總督在門外
The viceroy of pithom is outside.

344
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,740
議事日程是沒有他
He's not on the agenda.

345
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,400
讓他回比東去
He can go back to pithom until he is.

346
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,070
不  我們應該處理這事
No, we should deal with this.

347
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,480
叫他進來
Bring him in.

348
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,580
如果你想來請求新國王的原諒  
If you came here to beg the new king's forgiveness...

349
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,470
想都別想
It won't work.

350
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,130
逮捕他
Arrest him.

351
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,290
請等一下
Wait, please.

352
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,960
能讓我說句話嗎  
May I at least respond?

353
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,310
請求你
I beg you.

354
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,970
這關乎你的利益
It's in your interest.

355
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,010
-長話短說  -好的  
-You make it short.  -I will...

356
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,300
只能對國王一人說
To the king alone.

357
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,270
我建議  
My advice is that...

358
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,980
他和其他人離開房間
He, and the other generals, also leave the room.

359
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,440
是嘛  
Really?

360
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,310
你的建議  
That's your advice?

361
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,610
你不是他的軍師
You are not his advisor.

362
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,150
沒錯  你才是
That's right. You are.

363
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,280
沒錯
That's right.

364
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,880
摩西
Moses.

365
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,290
摩西
Moses.

366
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,000
除了總督其他人出去
Everybody but the viceroy...

367
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,540
出去
Out.

368
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,360
有個壞消息
Terrible news.

369
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,870
你來了
There you are.

370
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,610
那麼  
So...

371
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,830
那個總督
The viceroy.

372
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,700
你沒逮捕他
You didn't arrest him.

373
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,330
你沒有聽從我這個首席軍師的建議
You didn't take your chief advisor's advice.

374
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,710
沒有  他來
No, he came.

375
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,930
告訴我關於兩個衛兵的事
He told me of an incident involving two guards...

376
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,180
其中一個在襲擊中倖存了下來
One of which survived the attack.

377
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,190
我和他說我不在乎這種事
And I told him I did not care.

378
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,010
然後  他告訴了我一個難以置信的故事
And then, he told me the most unbelievable story.

379
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,970
他說  消息完全可靠
Told to him, he said, by very reliable sources.

380
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,560
我給了他點壓力  
Then, when pressed...

381
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,030
他透露出他們都是希伯來間諜
He admitted that they were Hebrew spies.

382
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,860
你懂我的意思
You know what I'm talking about.

383
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,230
是的
Yes.

384
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,540
你是怎麼想的  
And what do you make of it?

385
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,280
我覺著這很無禮  也很荒謬
I think it's offensive, and I think it's ridiculous.

386
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,710
是啊  
Yes. Yes!

387
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,500
你  所有人  都是希伯來人
You, of all people, a Hebrew.

388
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,670
然後我說  
And I said...

389
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,580
我要這麼相信這事  
How can I believe such a story?

390
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,090
兄弟  
Cousin...

391
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,710
你不能信
You can't.

392
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,340
如果我選擇相信這事呢  摩西  
What if I take the chance of believing it, Moses?

393
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,770
我要怎麼做  
What am I to do?

394
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,230
比西亞  
Bithia!

395
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,850
母親
Mother.

396
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,940
那人是個賊
The man is a thief.

397
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,370
是我兒子發現了這事
My son discovers this.

398
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,030
而不是你
Not you.

399
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,530
他也報告給了你父親  要不是你父親他死了  
And he reports it to your father, who would have hanged this thief...

400
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
就會把那人絞死
If he hadn't been dying himself.

401
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,290
你卻相信了他自私荒誕的謊言
You believe his feeble, self-serving lies.

402
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,080
我只想知道是否屬實
All I want to know is if it is true.

403
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,540
不要長篇大論了
I didn't ask for a tirade.

404
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
這事談的越多
To talk about this any longer...

405
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,760
就會越誇大
Would dignify it...

406
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,050
-我不想再談了  -那就回答
-And I won't do that.  -Answer the question.

407
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,850
是或否  
Yes or no?

408
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,090
我在和你說話麼  
Was I talking to you?

409
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,420
帶她上來  帶她上來
Bring her in. Bring her in.

410
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,310
快  
Now!

411
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,470
米裡亞姆  
Miriam!

412
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,060
過來  坐下
Come. Sit down.

413
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,730
有些事我要問你  
Now, I'm going to ask you some things...

414
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,690
或許你覺得問題很奇怪
That are going to seem very strange to you.

415
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,620
只需要你如實回答
I just would like you to answer them truthfully.

416
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,660
你瞭解摩西嗎  
How do you know Moses?

417
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,070
我知道我多瞭解他  
You know how I know him...

418
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,580
還有你
And you.

419
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,710
我撫養了你倆
I helped raise you both.

420
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,620
你不是他姐  對吧  
So you are not his sister, then?

421
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,750
當然不是
Of course not.

422
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,850
你也不是希伯來人
And you're not a Hebrew.

423
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,210
不是
No.

424
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,590
把你手放在桌上
Place your arm on the table.

425
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,110
拉美西斯  
Ramses...

426
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,140
別做傻事  
don't be stupid!

427
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
我沒在和你說話  
I am not talking to you!

428
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,410
我在和她說
I am talking to her.

429
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,780
米裡亞姆  把整個手放桌上
Your whole arm on the table, Miriam.

430
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,410
謝謝
Thank you.

431
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,910
拉美西斯  
Ramses...

432
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,200
別把事搞大了
Don't take this any further.

433
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,300
別把事搞大了  否則呢  
Don't take this any further, or what?

434
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,540
別把事搞大了
Do not take this any further.

435
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,970
你確定要對著干  
Are you quite sure about that?

436
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,680
把手拿開  或者馬上拿起它
Get your hand off it, or use it, now.

437
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,550
或許你想回答這個問題  
Or perhaps you'd like to answer the question?

438
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,390
那我繼續了
Then I'll proceed.

439
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,570
米裡亞姆  我再問你一遍  
Miriam, I'm going to ask you again...

440
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,930
如果回答仍不
And if your answer is again no...

441
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,950
對接下來的事我就表示遺憾了
I apologize for what happens next.

442
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,410
你是他姐嗎  
Are you his sister?

443
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
不是
No.

444
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,180
是的  
Yes!

445
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,350
是的  
Yes!

446
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,760
不需要理由你也能殺了他  但你有理由
You don't need a reason to kill him, but you have one.

447
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,590
-這是叛國  -怎麼叛國了  
-This was treason. -How was it treason?

448
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,880
他承認他知道
He just admitted he knew.

449
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,300
那不算是承認
That wasn't an admission!

450
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,970
他只是不想她的手被砍掉
Simply did not want her arm lopped off!

451
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,840
我從他眼裡看出來
I saw it in his eyes.

452
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,940
他不相信這個故事
He does not believe this story.

453
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,780
我也不想去相信它  
I don't want to believe it!

454
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,810
你想要相信  因為這是除掉他的一個機會  
You want to believe it, because it's an opportunity to be rid of him...

455
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,990
你一直都想這麼干
Which you always wanted.

456
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,280
我沒說要"流放"他  而是要他死
I didn't say "exiled," I said "dead."

457
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,000
我肯定  他會死在  
That, I'm sure, will follow...

458
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,460
他要去的地方
Where he's going.

459
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,460
錫安
Khyan...

460
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,300
允許我和我母親說句話
Allow me to talk to my mother.

461
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,380
好的  長官
Yes, sir, yes.

462
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,910
過來  米裡亞姆
Come, Miriam.

463
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,070
並不是每個人都會去保護
It isn't every man who would protect a servant 

464
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,610
對他來說微不足道的僕人
who's nothing more to him than that.

465
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,620
至少這個家族沒有這樣的人
Certainly no one else in this family...

466
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,330
包括我
Including me.

467
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,040
我本不該說出他想聽到的答案
I wouldn't have said what he wanted to hear.

468
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,430
她也是
And neither would she.

469
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,380
我們非常愛你
That's how much we love you.

470
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,730
"我們"  
"We"?

471
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,270
這不是真的
It's not true.

472
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,530
是真的
It is true.

473
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,520
我把你帶到河邊時  你戴著這個
You were wearing this when I brought you to the river.

474
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,110
我把它摘下來  目的很明確
I took it off you for obvious reasons.

475
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,000
那才是你
That's you.

476
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,040
這是你和你母親之間維繫的物
The connection between you and our mother.

477
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,760
你姐救了你
Your sister saved your life.

478
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,920
現在你救了她  
Now you saved hers...

479
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,930
摩西
Moshe.

480
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,450
米裡亞姆
Miriam.

481
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,050
抱歉  長官
Sorry, sir.

482
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,280
摩西  
Moses!

483
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,480
摩西  
Moses!

484
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,150
我沒啥可偷的了
I have nothing to steal.

485
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,060
我的馬死了
My horse is dead.

486
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,700
我們不是來要你的馬  摩西
We're not here for your horse, moshe.

487
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,700
\an8紅海  蒂朗海峽

488
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,620
再高一點
A little bit higher.

489
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,760
你要幹嘛  
What are you doing?

490
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,850
別停  繼續幹活
Don't stop. Keep working.

491
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,640
喂  給我們的羊弄點水
You, get water for our goats.

492
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,860
喂
You.

493
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,200
還沒輪到你
Wait your turn.

494
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,090
把你們的羊從水槽那趕走
Move your animals away from the troughs.

495
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,090
又屬於你們的了
It's yours again.

496
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,040
你從哪來  
Where are you from?

497
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,550
西面
West of here.

498
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,050
你要去哪  
Where are you going?

499
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,960
東面
East.

500
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,300
你犯了何事  
What did you do?

501
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,220
什麼意思  
What do you mean?

502
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,010
你犯了什麼罪  
You committed some crime?

503
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,140
恕我直言  
With respect...

504
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,010
您女兒邀請我來用餐
Your daughters invited me for some food.

505
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,520
沒說會審問我
They did not tell me there would be an interrogation.

506
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,100
抱歉
I'm sorry.

507
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,570
我只是好奇
I'm just curious.

508
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,860
歡迎你在飯前清洗下身子
You are welcome to get cleaned up before dinner...

509
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,040
如果你願意的話  
If that appeals to you...

510
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,390
今晚你也可以留下  
And stay the night if you want...

511
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,790
明天繼續趕路  
Before continuing on...

512
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,790
不管你要去哪
To wherever it is.

513
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,080
謝謝你
Thank you.

514
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,400
和我描述下孟斐斯吧
Describe Memphis to someone...

515
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
我從未有機會也不會有機會去那
Who's never been there and never will.

516
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,230
它  
It's...

517
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,540
我不想用"文明"這詞  
I don't want to say "civilized"...

518
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,860
不想冒犯你們  但它確實是文明城市
Because I don't want to offend, but it is civilized.

519
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,780
那裡不僅僅是羊多
There's more there than sheep and goats.

520
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,410
這裡也不僅僅是羊多
There's more here than that.

521
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,130
真的  有什麼  
Really? Where?

522
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,760
抱歉  我真無禮
I'm sorry, that was rude.

523
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,510
我真無禮
That was rude.

524
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,920
雖然住在這  但我並不無知
I'm not ignorant just because I live here.

525
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,770
看得出來
I can see that.

526
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,690
我敢說
I can tell you one thing.

527
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,820
目前為止
This is by far...

528
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,440
在我來的和要去的地方
The nicest place...

529
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,900
這裡地方最棒
Between here and there.

530
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,080
你要走了  
And so you're leaving?

531
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,440
當然
Of course.

532
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,990
我這樣的人不屬於這裡
There's nothing here for someone like me.

533
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,620
什麼時候  
When?

534
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,460
今天  
Today?

535
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,380
牢記此時此刻  
Remember this moment in time...

536
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,310
誓言之後  
For after these vows...

537
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,610
你將向世界宣佈  
You shall say to the world...

538
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,650
"這是我丈夫"這是我妻子"
"This is my husband." "This is my wife."

539
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,400
我  西坡拉
I, zipporah...

540
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,660
我  摩西
I, Moses...

541
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,580
-西坡拉  我願意  -摩西  我願意
-Accept you, zipporah...  -Accept you, Moses...

542
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,290
接受你真正的樣子
To be no other than yourself.

543
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,330
深愛我所瞭解的你  
Loving what I know of you...

544
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,330
信賴我所不知道的你
Trusting what I do not yet know.

545
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,300
相敬如賓  
With respect...

546
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,680
真心誠意  
For your integrity...

547
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,210
忠貞不渝  
And faith...

548
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,010
相親相愛  
In your abiding love for me.

549
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,550
不管生活如何  
In all that life may bring us...

550
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,810
我都承諾愛你
I pledge my love.

551
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,310
我都承諾愛你
I pledge my love.

552
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,190
誰讓你幸福  
Who makes you happy?

553
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,280
你啊
You do.

554
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,360
你生命中什麼最重要  
What's the most important thing in your life?

555
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,870
你啊
You are.

556
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,410
你想去哪裡  
Where would you rather be?

557
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,740
哪也不去
Nowhere.

558
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,450
何時離我而去  
And when will you leave me?

559
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,960
永遠不會
Never.

560
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,460
繼續
Proceed.

561

\an89年後

我說婆賽
I said "per se."

563
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,190
我不想討論我墓穴
I don't want to discuss my tomb, per se.

564
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,110
我只想知道你為什麼一直喜歡討論我的墓穴
I want to discuss why you seem to want to discuss it all the time.

565
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,250
恕我直言  
Respectfully...

566
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,080
這是你繼位以來第一個建築項目
It should have been your first construction order on taking the throne.

567
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,740
你可以想像  工程之大
It'll be a big project, as you might imagine.

568
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,090
顯然  我的宮殿也是
So is my house, apparently.

569
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,870
宮殿有什麼問題  
Is there a problem with the palace?

570
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,510
它還沒完工
It's not done.

571
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,370
不會太久的
It won't be long now.

572
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,340
幾個月前你也這麼說  而我住的像個  
You said that months ago. Meanwhile I'm living there like...

573
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,090
貝都因人
A bedouin.

574
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,630
趕緊完工
Get it done.

575
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,810
快點  
Faster!

576
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,720
是否需要我殺掉點人  
Or do I have to kill somebody?

577
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,640
我們都瞭解你的意思了
I think you made your point.

578
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,360
扔的好準  父親
Good throw, father.

579
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,080
只要瞄高一點
Just aim a little higher.

580
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,080
差點
Almost.

581
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,180
你去過山頂嗎  
Have you ever been to the top?

582
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,140
沒有
No.

583
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,350
想去嗎  
Would you like to?

584
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,060
母親說禁止去那
Mother says it's forbidden.

585
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,110
誰禁止  
By who?

586
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,150
我們的上帝
Our God.

587
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,110
我們的上帝
Our God...

588
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,490
不允許我們爬山  
Stops us from climbing mountains?

589
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,200
不是每座山
Not every Mountain.

590
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,990
只那一座
Just that one.

591
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,330
它是上帝之山
It's God's Mountain.

592
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,010
你讓他感到困惑
You're confusing him.

593
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,810
不是我本意
I'm not trying to.

594
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:51,690
讓我們的孩子沒有信仰的成長  這好嗎  
Is it good for our boy to grow up believing in nothing?

595
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,740
信仰自己的成長  不好嗎  
Is it bad to grow up believing in yourself?

596
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,150
-這是我的信仰  -我知道
-It's my faith.  -I know.

597
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,940
-這也是他的  -我理解
-And it's his, too.  -I understand.

598
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,950
當他大了再做選擇
He can make up his mind when he's older.

599
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,540
-對  -就和你一樣
-Yes.  -Just like you.

600
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,370
很多方面他已經很像我
He's a lot like me already.

601
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,240
摩西
Moshe.

602
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,100
救救我  
Help me!

603
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,760
我的腿可能斷了
I think my leg is broken.

604
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,390
不單如此
More than that.

605
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,240
你說什麼  
What did you say?

606
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,450
你是誰  
Who are you?

607
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:15,910
你是誰  
Who are you?

608
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,960
我是個牧羊人
I'm a Shepherd.

609
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,090
我以為你是個將軍
I thought you were a general.

610
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,590
我需要位將軍
I need a general.

611
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,440
為什麼  
Why?

612
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,140
去打仗
To fight.

613
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,680
還能幹嘛  
Why else?

614
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,820
對抗誰  
Fight who?

615
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,030
為何而戰  
For what?

616
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,490
我想你知道
I think you know.

617
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:58,340
你該去看看你的人民現在的處境
I think you should go and see what's happening to your people now.

618
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,120
否則他們終不得安寧
He won't be at peace until you do.

619
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,840
或在你看來  
Or are they not people...

620
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,630
他們不是你的人民  
In your opinion?

621
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,510
你是誰  
Who are you?

622
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,360
我就是我
I am.

623
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,330
我就是我
I am.

624
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,330
你撞到頭了
You were hit on the head.

625
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,390
之後你所看到的  
Anything you saw...

626
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,890
或你以為你看到的
Or think you saw afterwards...

627
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,420
都是幻覺
Was an effect of that.

628
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,020
風暴  
The storm...

629
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:58,470
在我撞到頭之前風暴就開始了
The storm started before I was hit on the head.

630
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,770
-那不是風暴  -好了  好了
-It was not a storm. -Fine, fine.

631
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,650
風暴是真的
The storm was something.

632
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,690
風暴不是真的
It was something else.

633
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,530
-但你腦子裡全是那個孩子  -你怎麼知道  
-But the boy was all in your head. -How do you know?

634
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,660
你怎麼知道  
How do you know?

635
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:09,690
因為上帝不是個孩子  
Because God isn't a boy!

636
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,440
那他看起來像什麼  
Then what does he look like?

637
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,200
描述下  給我描述下
Describe him. Describe him to someone like me.

638
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,520
你說話聽起來像什麼知道嗎  
Do you know what you sound like?

639
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:21,330
聽起來我像在妄想
Yes. I sound delusional.

640
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,370
是的
Yes.

641
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,330
是的
Yes.

642
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,620
-你需要好好休息  -是的  是的
-You just need more rest. -Yes, yes.

643
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,930
我有事要告訴你
I have to tell you something.

644
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,720
我有事要告訴你
I have to tell you something.

645
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,050
我對你沒完全坦誠
I've not been completely honest with you.

646
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,260
是什麼  
About what?

647
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,940
我的身份
About who I am.

648
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,730
我所做所為以及我的身份
About what I've done and who I was.

649
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,360
還有我的感受
And how I feel.

650
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,240
-關於你對我的感受  -不是
-About what you feel about me?  -No.

651
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,500
對於你的感受我一直是真誠的
No, I've been honest about that.

652
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,790
休息吧
Rest.

653
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,590
-休息  -別離開我
-Rest.  -Don't leave me.

654
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,010
不  不
No. No.

655
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,650
摩西
Moshe.

656
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,040
革舜  
Gershom?

657
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,010
你在這幹嘛  
What are you doing out here?

658
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,050
沒什麼
Nothing.

659
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,600
睡不著
I can't sleep.

660
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,170
在擔心我  
Are you worried about me?

661
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,720
是的
Yes.

662
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,360
別擔心
Don't.

663
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,440
我沒事
I'll be fine.

664
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,240
那是什麼  
What's that?

665
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:15,820
它看起來像什麼  
What's it look like?

666
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,030
進來
Come inside.

667
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,000
進來  
Come inside!

668
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,740
你拿它們要做什麼  
What are you going to do with all that?

669
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,860
確保我能再見到你
Make sure I see you again.

670
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,410
放下它  你一直能見著我
Put it down and you can see me forever.

671
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,100
這是什麼意思  
What's this mean?

672
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,230
這是某個我認識的人名
It's someone I used to know.

673
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,780
我不會一去不回
This is not forever.

674
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,030
還會回來見你
I will see you again.

675
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,790
相信我嗎  
Do you believe me?

676
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,130
乖乖的
Good for you.

677
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,170
不要說一些人們想要聽的話
Don't ever just say what people want to hear.

678
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,540
我會  
But I will...

679
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,460
我會再見到你
I will see you again.

680
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:11,100
能替我保管好這個嗎  
Will you keep this for me?

681
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,230
革舜
Gershom.

682
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,200
革舜  看著我
Gershom, please look at me.

683
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,550
什麼樣的上帝會讓一個男人  
What kind of God tells a man...

684
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,620
離開他的家庭  
To leave his family?

685
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,760
如果你能理解  我也會理解
If you understand it, I'll understand it.

686
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,880
我不理解
I don't.

687
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,720
所以回答不了你
So I can't answer that question.

688
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,350
如果這是信仰的意思  我願意背棄自己信仰  
If that's what faith means, I will trade mine...

689
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,890
維護你的信仰
To keep you.

690
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,700
別碰我
Don't touch me.

691
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,490
走
Go.

692
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,950
走  
Go!

693
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,510
老爹  能給點牛奶嗎  
Father, have you some milk to spare?

694
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,100
好的
Yes.

695
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,100
你來自哪裡  
Where did you come from?

696
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,860
我來自海邊
I come from the sea.

697
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:26,660
這條路狹窄兇險
It's a narrow and dangerous path.

698
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,200
謝謝你  老爹
Thank you, father.

699
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:49,620
耶和華  我記得你

700
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,650

701
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,670
看著馬
Keep your eye on the horse.

702
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,940

01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,150
你哥哥
Your brother.

705
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,190
以他瑪
Ithamar.

706
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,530
以他瑪  他  
Ithamar, this...

707
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,120
是你著名的摩西叔叔

曾是埃及王子
He was once a prince of Egypt.

709
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,770

大家都沒事
Everybody's fine.

711
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,940
睡的真香啊  我的孩子
You sleep so well, my boy...

712
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,320
因為你知道我們都愛著你
Because you know you are loved.

713
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,320
我就沒法睡好
I've never slept so well.

714
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,110
我應該稱呼你為  
I'm told I should address you...

715
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:29,470
偉大的拉美西斯
As ramses the great, now.

716
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,360
摩西  
Moses...

717
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,820
你還活著
You're alive.

718
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,900
-很高興你還活著  -真的  
-I'm glad you're alive.  -Really?

719
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,040
所以你才派了兩名殺手來殺我  
Is that why you only sent two assassins to kill me?

720
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,990
是我母親
My mother.

721
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,450
-別怪她  -是她想你死
-Don't blame her. -Yes, she wanted you dead.

722
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,050
你覺得會是誰把劍藏在你能找到的地方  
Who do you think hid your sword where you would find it?

723
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,910
摩西
Moses.

724
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,420
我不是來  
I'm not here...

725
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:01,630
奪取你的王位
To take your throne.

726
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,350
也不是關於你很擔心的那個預言
It's not about the prophecy that worries you so much.

727
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,520
而是其他事情
This is something else.

728
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,900
有人告訴我  
I have been told...

729
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:12,360
這裡的情況變得  
That things here have become...

730
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,610
更糟了
Much worse.

731
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:18,240
這裡的情況從未如此好過  摩西
Things are better than they ever have been, Moses.

732
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,360
不
No.

733
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,910
-我們有秩序  -秩序  
-We have order.  -Order?

734
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,120
奴隸們  
The slaves...

735
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,170
他們的屍體日夜在燃燒
Their bodies burn night and day now.

736
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,050
我親眼所見
I've seen it with my own eyes.

737
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,200
你稱那是秩序  
You call that order?

738
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,370
他們是奴隸
They're slaves.

739
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,840
-不  他們不是  -你覺得是什麼  
-No, they're not. -What would you expect?

740
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,640
他們是埃及人  像埃及人那樣對待他們
They're Egyptians, they should be treated as Egyptians.

741
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,210
他們應享有同樣的權利  
They should have the same rights...

742
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,890
他們的勞動應該有報酬  
They should be paid for their work...

743
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,850
否則你就得放他們走
Or you must set them free.

744
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,350
他們不是埃及人
They are not Egyptians.

745
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,510
摩西  他們是奴隸  你覺得呢  
They are slaves, Moses. What else do you expect?

746
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,840
如果像動物那樣
They wouldn't know what to do...

747
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,400
讓他們自食其力  他們就不知道該怎麼辦了
If all of a sudden they were left to fend for themselves like animals.

748
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,780
別稱他們為動物  
Do not call them animals!

749
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,410
從經濟角度來看
Listen,from an economic standpoint alone...

750
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:02,910
你的要求  
What you're asking...

751
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,410
絕對會產生問題
Is problematic to say the least.

752
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,910
我沒指望你直截了說"是"
I didn't expect to hear a simple yes.

753
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,710
但我也不想聽你直接說"不"
But I do not want to hear a simple no.

754
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,580
你是在和我說"不"嗎  
Is that what you are telling me? Are you saying no?

755
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,840
我沒有說"不"
I'm not saying no.

756
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,130
我需要時間
I'm saying time.

757
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,590
時間
Time.

758
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,510
你在聽從希伯來人
You're listening to hebrews.

759
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:25,710
我沒聽從希伯來人
I'm not listening to hebrews.

760
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:28,430
那你在和誰交談  
Who are you talking to?

761
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:30,970
上帝
God.

762
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:37,320
上帝
God.

763
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,910
哪位上帝  
Which God?

764
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:03,760
你不用認真考慮他的提議
You're not seriously considering his proposal.

765
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,460
那是提議嗎  
Is it a proposal?

766
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:09,380
如果一個人拿著劍指著你的喉嚨
If a man is holding a dagger to your throat, minister?

767
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,840
-它是提議嗎  -我說錯了
-Is it? -I stand corrected.

768
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,020
那是要求
That's a demand.

769
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,400
他失去理智了
He has lost his mind.

770
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,530
他找到了一位上帝  他的上帝
He's found a God. His God.

771
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,660
而不是我們的上帝  
Not one of ours...

772
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,530
所以我想要摩西  
So I would like Moses...

773
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,040
我想要摩西死
I want Moses dead.

774
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,380
聽懂了嗎  
Did you hear me?

775
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,340
是的
Yes.

776
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,300
退下吧
Then, go.

777
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:43,670
還有  
And...

778
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,060
他的家人
His family, too.

779
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,530
摩西
Moses.

780
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,700
摩西在哪  
Where's Moses?

781
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:11,360
摩西  摩西在哪  
Moses? Where's Moses?

782
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,620
摩西  
Moses...

783
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,410
他的家人
His family.

784
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,800
他們在哪  
Where are they?

785
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,060
他不是摩西
This is not Moses.

786
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:29,070
這不是他家人
This is not his family.

787
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,450
他這個男人
This is a man...

788
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,450
他的妻子
His wife...

789
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,570
以及他的孩子
And his child...

790
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,790
他們在被問及"他在哪"這個簡單問題時
Who when asked the simple question, "where is he?"...

791
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:45,620
回答了"我們不知道"
Answered, "we don't know."

792
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,140
今晚  帶著這一幕回家
Carry this image home with you tonight...

793
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,610
商討下你們為什麼要保護他  
And discuss why you would protect him...

794
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,600
記住明天此時
Knowing that tomorrow at this time...

795
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,570
又會有一個家庭  
There will be another family...

796
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,980
和他們一樣
Where this one is.

797
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:15,360
後天
And another the day after.

798
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,330
再後天
And the day after that.

799
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,840
會不會輪到你家  
Dare I say yours?

800
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,010
去吧
Go ahead.

801
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,600
我想參加戰鬥
I want to join the fight.

802
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,640
進去
In there.

803
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,060
耶和華  你用的膝蓋
Joshua, use your knee.

804
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,330
很好
It's good.

805
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,140
雙眼睜開  
Both eyes open!

806
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,360
搭箭  開弓  
Nock! Draw!

807
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,110
射箭  
Loose!

808
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:34,190
前進
Advance.

809
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,700
搭箭  開弓
Nock. Draw.

810
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:37,570
射箭  
Loose!

811
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,240
開弓  
Draw!

812
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,410
射箭  
Loose!

813
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,410
開弓  
Draw!

814
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,040
射箭  
Loose!

815
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,420
再來  
Again!

816
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,520
戰爭分兩種
There are two kinds of warfare.

817
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:04,810
每一種跟人數有關
Each is dictated by numbers.

818
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,360
人數多  
With greater numbers...

819
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:10,030
你迎頭而上進攻  
You attack the enemy head on!

820
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:13,160
直擊要害  
You stab it in the heart!

821
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,200
人數少  就從側面進攻
With fewer numbers, you come at it from the side.

822
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,200
取其七寸
You cut off the blood...

823
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,160
斷其筋脈
That pumps the heart.

824
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,490
切斷軍火供給
The army supply lines.

825
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:25,750
不  
No!

826
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,960
切斷人民的供給
The people's supply lines.

827
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,300
他們的食物  
Their food...

828
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:30,960
他們的財物  
Their property...

829
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,790
他們的安逸
Their comfort.

830
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,090
那會得到什麼  
What would that achieve?

831
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,850
一切
Everything.

832
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,130
只有埃及人民  
Only the Egyptian people...

833
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:41,180
才能逼迫他接受我們  
Can force him to accept our demands...

834
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,180
自由的要求  我們必須迫使他們  
For freedom. We must force them...

835
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,940
逼迫他同意  
To make him say yes!

836
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:48,530
是不是  
Yes?

837
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,850
是  
Yes!

838
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:50,990
是不是  
Yes?

839
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,520
是  
Yes!

840
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,030
跟著我
With me!

841
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,290
跟著我
With me!

842
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
準備
Ready.

843
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,890
你不打算想想辦法了  
You're not going to do anything?

844
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,060
我可沒這麼說
I didn't say that.

845
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,680
你去哪了  
Where have you been?

846
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,070
看你如何失敗
Watching you fail.

847
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,730
消耗戰需要時間
Wars of attrition take time.

848
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,350
按這速度  你要花上幾年  
At this rate, you'll take years...

849
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,910
一輩子
A generation.

850
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,730
我準備好打這麼久的仗了
I am prepared to fight for that long.

851
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,610
我沒有
I'm not.

852
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,600
我想我們有點起色了
I thought we were making progress.

853
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,580
你卻不耐煩了
Now, you're impatient.

854
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,500
400年的奴役都過去了
After 400 years of slavery.

855
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:45,260
直到現在  我是唯一無所事事的人嗎  
Am I the only one sitting here who's done nothing about this until now?

856
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,460
我知道  
I do know...

857
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,020
一些軍事戰術
A few things about military action.

858
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:51,880
如果你不願聽從我  
Still, if you're not going to listen to me...

859
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,390
為何你要讓我遠離
Then why did you take me away...

860
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,930
我的家庭  
From my family?

861
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,430
不是我
I didn't.

862
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,530
是你
You did.

863
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,600
你不需要我
ou don't need me.

864
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:03,770
或許不需要
Maybe not.

865
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,120
那我該怎麼辦  啥都不干  
So what do I do? Nothing?

866
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,290
現在起  
For now...

867
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,240
你就看著
You can watch.

868
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,240
\an8上帝要降下"十災"

869
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:57,640
神聖的凱貝潔特女神  我謙卑的召喚你  
Divine goddess kebechet, I humbly call upon you...

870
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,260
來淨化我們賴以生存的水域
To purify the waters of our life-giving river.

871
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:17,950
還要多久  
How long will it take?

872
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,570
不會太久
Not long.

873
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,750
還要稍微久點
But longer than that.

874
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,650
拉美西斯  拉美西斯  
Ramses! Ramses!

875
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,020
什麼事  
Yes?

876
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,990
夠了  
Enough!

877
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,640
想想辦法  
Do something!

878
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,020
他們只是青蛙
They're just frogs.

879
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,700
退後  退後
Back away, back away.

880
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,040
不乾淨
Unclean.

881
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,540
不  不  不  別喝
No, no, no. Don't drink.

882
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:30,580
不乾淨
Unclean.

883
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,700
我都知道  尼羅河攜帶一定數量的泥土
The nile, as we know, carries a certain amount of Clay.

884
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,210
今年泥土數量異常得多
This year there's much more of it than usual...

885
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,710
漂浮在河流中  沉積在河床上  
Drifting in on the currents, settling on the riverbeds...

886
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:15,460
並被鱷魚給攪渾了
And kicked up by the wild thrashing of the crocodiles.

887
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,880
這種渾濁  
This thrashing not only...

888
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,460
不但大大改變了水的顏色  也污染了水  
Dramatically changed the color of the water, but it fouled it...

889
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,560
以至於把魚殺死了
To the point of killing the fish.

890
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,890
但青蛙  我們都知道  
But frogs, as we know...

891
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:29,100
在不得已的情況下  他們會跳出水面
Can get out of the water, when they have to.

892
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,890
現在就這情況
Which they did.

893
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:33,650
但青蛙仍然需要水  
But frogs still need water...

894
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:36,450
但是在我們城市的路上找不到水
And when they can't find it in the streets of our city...

895
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,620
它們就怎麼樣  
They what?

896
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:41,240
它們死了  
They die?

897
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,620
它們死了  
They die!

898
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,780
然後腐爛
And then they decompose.

899
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,450
然後虱子  蛆和蒼蠅都來了
And then the gnats come and the maggots come and the flies come.

900
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:51,450
然後  
And then...

901
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,470
然後什麼  
And then what?

902
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,840
蒼蠅會死
The flies die.

903
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,210
快說
Speak up.

904
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,020
在希伯來人那找到的
It's in Hebrew.

905
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:48,220
希伯來人  
Hebrew?

906
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,510
念出來
Read it.

907
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,900
"這些災難  
"These catastrophes...

908
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:52,890
"乃上帝所賜  
"Are the work of God...

909
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:55,360
"災難還沒結束  只會變得更糟
"And they have not finished. They will get worse.

910
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,190
"看在彼此份上  
"We need to reach a settlement...

911
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:59,810
"我們需要達成協議"
"For both our sakes."

912
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:04,580
上帝所賜
So, the work of God.

913
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,120
我給你們的協議
Here is my settlement to you.

914
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,880
就是工作量翻倍
Work quotas shall be doubled...

915
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,500
不會給你們稻草  
And you will get no straw...

916
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,290
來搬運磚塊
To make your bricks.

917
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:21,620
或許你們的上帝
Perhaps your God...

918
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:24,040
會提供給你
Will provide it for you.

919
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,750
起初我很感動
I was impressed at first.

920
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,210
現在不是了
Not anymore.

921
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,670
這殃及了所有人
This is affecting everyone.

922
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:04,840
你在懲罰誰  
So, who are you punishing?

923
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,560
他怎麼了  
What's wrong with him?

924
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,320
生病了
It's sick.

925
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,950
這是什麼  
What is this?

926
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,960
-你幹的  -不是我
-Did you do this?  -Not me.

927
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,170
-你幹的  -不  不  
-Is this you?  -No, no!

928
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,550
它怎麼了  
What's happened to him?

929
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,370
我們的醫療已有長足進步
We have made great strides in medicine.

930
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:19,180
然而  
However, 

931
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,690
仍然有一些疾病我們所不瞭解
there are still a few hidden diseases that we don't completely understand.

932
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,910
動物也不例外  
Animals are not exempt...

933
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,540
我猜想  
And there is some conjecture...

934
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:31,890
這些瘟病可能來自最小的生物
That these maladies can migrate from the smallest creature.

935
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:32,930
比如  
Like a...

936
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:35,190
蒼蠅
A fly.

937
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,680
你最近去過河邊嗎  
Have you been out to the river lately?

938
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,350
我再次祈求凱貝潔特女神
I appealed to kebechet again...

939
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:49,200
以及其他六位神靈
And six more gods.

940
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,730
就這些  
Is that it?

941
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:05,720
收手了沒  
Are you done?

942
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,950
我收手了
I am.

943
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,590
你不出現  是想說明什麼  
Are you trying to say something with your absence?

944
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:31,340
想羞辱我嗎  
Is it meant to humble me?

945
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,640
沒用的  
Because it will not!

946
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,330
初步估計
Initial reports suggest...

947
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:45,880
超過一千萬平方公尺的莊稼被毀
More than 10 million square cubits of crops have been lost.

948
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,750
軍需官建議我們返一部分糧食
The quartermaster has suggested we return a portion...

949
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:52,040
來補給民用倉庫
Of the supplement to the civil granary.

950
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,220
仁善之舉
An act of mercy.

951
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,630
你的人民在挨餓
Your people are starving.

952
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:01,730
你想我也挨餓是嗎  
Are you suggesting that I should starve, too?

953
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:03,390
不
No.

954
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,150
人民有足夠的水
People have plenty of water.

955
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,560
他們能忍受住
They will endure.

956
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:48,980
瞄準  
Aim!

957
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,230
射箭  
Fire!

958
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,110
瞄準  
Aim!

959
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,650
射箭  
Fire!

960
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:55,130
是你嗎  
Is that you?

961
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,840
摩西  
Moses?

962
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,180
兄弟  
Brother?

963
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,520
你是來談判的  
Have you come to negotiate?

964
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,850
我準備好了  
Because I'm ready...

965
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:16,360
我給你個條件
As I have an offer for you.

966
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:20,240
這類事情再發生一次  
One more thing happens...

967
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:25,490
我也會降我的瘟疫
And I will bring my own plague to you.

968
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:30,120
每個還不會走路的  
You see, every Hebrew child...

969
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,030
希伯來孩童  
Not yet walking...

970
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,290
將永遠沒機會走路
They never shall.

971
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:38,790
因為我會把他們淹死在尼羅河
Because I will drown them in the nile.

972
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,180
就像你本該的那樣
As you should have been.

973
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:49,170
你敢說這些不是你造成的  
You say that you didn't cause all this?

974
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,900
你的上帝干的  
Your God did?

975
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:58,180
我就是上帝  我就是上帝  
I am the God! I am the God!

976
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:06,570
讓我們瞧瞧誰殺人更有效率  
So, let's just see who's more effective at killing.

977
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:09,530
你
You.

978
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,330
你的上帝
This God.

979
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,920
還是我
Or me.

980
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,940
你能來真好
Nice of you to come.

981
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,350
他達到你的要求了嗎  
He's given you what you asked?

982
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,990
還沒有  但他的人民在反對他
Not yet. But his own people are turning against him.

983
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:50,160
-他的軍隊呢  -也會的
-And his army?  -It will.

984
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,910
我不同意
I disagree.

985
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,570
還要發生更大的災難
Something worse has to happen.

986
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,920
我不同意
I disagree.

987
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:59,500
-任何災難將會  -將會怎樣  
-Anything more would be...  -Would be what?

988
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:00,620
你想說什麼  
What were you about to say?

989
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:03,250
殘忍  不人道  
Cruel? Inhumane?

990
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:06,340
這些人和我一起長大  
It's not easy to see...

991
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:09,300
看著他們受難很不好受
The people who I grew up with suffering this much.

992
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:11,550
那些沒和你一起成長的人們呢  
What about the people you didn't grow up with?

993
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,980
你對他們的感受是什麼  
What thought did you give to them?

994
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,720
你始終覺得他們不是你的人們  對吧  
You still don't think of them as yours, do you?

995
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,160
只要拉美西斯還有軍隊支撐著
As long as ramses has an army behind him...

996
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,850
形勢就不會改觀
Nothing will change.

997
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,610
任何災難都是復仇  
Anything more is just revenge!

998
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:27,660
復仇  經過400年的殘酷鎮壓  
Revenge? After 400 years of brutal subjugation?

999
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:32,380
這些法老幻想著他們是活神仙  
These pharaohs who imagine they're living gods, 

1000
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:34,120
他們不過是肉體凡胎
they're nothing more than flesh and blood.

1001
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:38,290
我要他們跪下來求我住手  
I want to see them on their knees, begging for it to stop!

1002
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:40,830
我受夠了和一個信使交談  
I'm tired of talking with a messenger!

1003
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,090
將軍  
General!

1004
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:51,130
我聽到了拉美西斯最終的威脅
I have heard ramses' final threat.

1005
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,480
讓我告訴你下來會發生什麼
So, let me tell you what's going to happen next.

1006
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,930
不  不
No. No.

1007
01:38:58,430 --> 01:39:00,350
你不能那麼做
You cannot do this.

1008
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,680
我不想再參合這事  
I want no part of this!

1009
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:29,760
停住  
Stay!

1010
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,060
-站住  -摩西  
-Hold!  -Moses?

1011
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,260
讓他過來
Leave him.

1012
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:46,060
-希安  -摩西
-Khyan. -Moses.

1013
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:03,210
我本可以殺了你
I could have you killed.

1014
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:05,750
我不這麼覺得
I don't think so.

1015
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:09,260
除非你親自動手
Unless you do it yourself.

1016
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:12,290
你的士兵放我進來的
Your own soldiers let me in.

1017
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,840
我不想再談判了
I am not negotiating anymore.

1018
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:21,270
我來的目的不是談判
That's not why I'm here.

1019
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:26,600
我是來告訴你  有事要發生
I came to tell you that something is coming...

1020
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,740
它已經超出我的掌控
That is out of my control.

1021
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:32,910
它會殃及成千上萬人  
Something that will affect thousands...

1022
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,280
成千上萬居民
And thousands of citizens.

1023
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,000
它會影響到你個人  
And it will affect you very personally 

1024
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,150
除非接受我的要求
unless you accept what I've asked for...

1025
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:42,460
並在太陽落山前  
And announce it publicly...

1026
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:46,340
公之於眾
Before the sun goes down.

1027
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,170
拉美西斯  
Ramses...

1028
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:53,630
別背對我  
Do not turn your back on me!

1029
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:00,690
這不是私人恩怨
This has nothing to do with you and I.

1030
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:04,360
遠遠不是
This is far beyond that.

1031
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,350
這關乎埃及人存亡  懂嗎  
This is about Egypt's survival. Do you understand?

1032
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:14,990
日落前
Sunset.

1033
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:18,540
否則  就太遲了
After that, it will be too late.

1034
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,110
什麼太遲了  
What will be too late?

1035
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,380
保護好你的孩子
You protect your child.

1036
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,490
今晚保護好你的孩子
You protect your child tonight.

1037
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:28,840
我的孩子  
My child?

1038
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:32,250
這是威脅嗎  
Is that a threat?

1039
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:39,850
這是威脅嗎  摩西  
Is that a threat? Moses!

1040
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,100
摩西  
Moses!

1041
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,100
告訴大家  
Tell everyone...

1042
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,360
去宰一頭羊
To slaughter a lamb...

1043
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:52,520
今晚用羊血  
And mark their doors...

1044
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:55,200
在門以及門框上
And their doorposts tonight...

1045
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,030
做標記  
With its blood.

1046
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,290
為什麼  
Why?

1047
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:04,030
如果我錯了  就可惜了羊兒
Pity the lambs if I am wrong.

1048
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:08,660
如果我是對的  
If I'm right...

1049
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:11,590
我們得祈禱它們得到永生
We will bless them for eternity.

1050
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,230
本奴  本奴  
Bennu? Bennu?

1051
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,400
不  
No!

1052
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,410
拉美西斯  
Ramses?

1053
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:33,450
拉美西斯
Ramses.

1054
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:38,080
拉美西斯
Ramses.

1055
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:56,940
不
No!

1056
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,780
撒迦利亞  
Zechariah?

1057
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,950
撒迦利亞  
Zechariah?

1058
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,150
跪下  
Kneel!

1059
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:13,390
出去  
Get out!

1060
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:15,770
兇手  
Murderer!

1061
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:18,440
孩童殺手  
Child killer!

1062
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:32,860
他們的孩子昨晚死了
Their children died last night.

1063
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:35,870
我的孩子也是
As did mine.

1064
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:42,840
是你的上帝干的  
Is this your God?

1065
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,870
孩童殺手  
A killer of children?

1066
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:52,380
什麼樣的上帝會有如此"傑作"  
What kind of fanatics worship such a God?

1067
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:02,220
昨晚希伯來孩童沒一個死的
No Hebrew child died last night.

1068
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:23,840
滾  
Get...

1069
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:25,760
滾出去
Out.

1070
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:28,720
走
Go.

1071
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,720
你們每個人  
Every one of you!

1072
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,260
滾  
Go!

1073
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,930
回到你們夢想的迦南去吧
Go to canaan if that's what you want.

1074
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,850
回到你們夢中的故土
Back to the homeland of your dreams.

1075
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:44,440
滾吧  
But go!

1076
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:49,860
聽從你的命令
As you command.

1077
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:04,500
這是我走過的路
This is the route I took.

1078
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:07,380
從這裡  我們往南去紅海
From here, we go South to the red sea.

1079
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:10,010
海峽在這  有點潮水  但能步行穿過
The straits are here. At low tide, we can cross on foot.

1080
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:51,690
知道為什麼你能睡這麼香嗎  我的孩子  
You know why you sleep so well, my boy?

1081
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:56,400
因為你知道我們都愛你
Because you know you are loved.

1082
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:50,250
恕我直言  
With respect...

1083
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:53,050
如果我們不抓個40萬奴隸回來
If we're going to recapture 400,000 slaves...

1084
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,750
我們就需要超過3個師的人
We might need more than three divisions.

1085
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:58,290
我們不抓任何奴隸
We're not recapturing anyone.

1086
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:03,340
前進  
Forward!

1087
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:43,670
我們應該休息
We should rest.

1088
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,970
不
No.

1089
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:48,130
到了紅海才安全
We're not safe until we cross the sea.

1090
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,360
摩西  
Moshe!

1091
01:52:56,730 --> 01:52:58,390
拉美西斯  
Ramses...

1092
01:52:58,440 --> 01:52:59,520
帶著4000人
4,000 men...

1093
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,150
一千輛馬車
A thousand chariots.

1094
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:02,480
離我們多遠  
How far behind us?

1095
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:04,330
4天路程
Four days.

1096
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,280
要是他們馬不停蹄  不到4天
Less, if they don't rest the horses.

1097
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:15,090
拉美西斯  
Ramses!

1098
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,370
拉美西斯  
Ramses!

1099
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,910
馬需要歇息
We need to rest the horses...

1100
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,500
士兵們也是  
And the men!

1101
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:35,430
海峽在那條路
The straits are that way.

1102
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:38,360
最長  最好走的路  
The longest, easiest route...

1103
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,030
在西海岸
Is down the Western coast.

1104
01:53:42,570 --> 01:53:46,330
或者我們穿過山脈
Or we go through the mountains.

1105
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:49,250
穿過山脈  
The mountains?

1106
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,860
為什麼  為什麼不走那條路  
Why? Why don't we take that route?

1107
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,410
我們可以  拉美西斯也可以
We can, but so can ramses.

1108
01:53:56,290 --> 01:53:58,380
山路險峻
The Mountain passes are dangerous...

1109
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:01,840
但對於拉美西斯的馬車來說太窄
But they are too narrow for ramses' chariots.

1110
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,510
他追不上  能給我們爭取點時間
He couldn't follow. That would give us needed time.

1111
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:07,590
上帝和你怎麼說  
What does God tell you?

1112
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:15,230
走山路
The mountains.

1113
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:18,570
能成功嗎  
Can we make it?

1114
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:26,070
前進  
Forward!

1115
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:08,900
走哪條路  
Which way from here?

1116
01:55:12,450 --> 01:55:13,710
待在這
Stay here.

1117
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:36,800
我們需要你的幫助
We need your help.

1118
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:46,610
我不知道身在何方
I don't know where I am.

1119
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,720
你不幫我  
You won't help me?

1120
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,630
你不幫我
You won't help them.

1121
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:23,820
這條路  
This way!

1122
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,400
出發  
Move out!

1123
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,880
這條路  
This way!

1124
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,430
你確定  
Are you sure?

1125
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:56,210
非常確定
I'm very sure.

1126
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,880
憑我們的裝備  你確定我們能翻過山  
I mean, are you sure we can make it across with our equipment...

1127
01:56:58,930 --> 01:57:00,510
我們的馬車呢  
Our chariots?

1128
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:02,570
他們都不覺得他們的裝備能翻過去
They didn't think they could with theirs.

1129
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:06,320
他們如何知道  
How would they know?

1130
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,570
他們又沒走過那裡
They've never been here.

1131
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:10,160
摩西或許知道
Moses may have.

1132
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:54,070
漲潮還是退潮  
Is this high tide or low tide?

1133
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:55,690
沒關係
Doesn't matter.

1134
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:58,740
這不是海峽  對吧  
This isn't the straits, is it?

1135
01:57:58,780 --> 01:57:59,780
不是
No.

1136
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,420
你知道我們在哪嗎  
Do you even know where we are?

1137
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,160
是的  
Yes!

1138
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:09,510
我們正在某個地方  前有大海
We're at a point on the earth where there is a sea ahead...

1139
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,290
後有追兵  
And an army behind!

1140
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,220
現在怎麼辦  
So now what?

1141
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,300
不管有沒追兵
Army or no army...

1142
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,220
我們都要休息
We have to rest.

1143
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:43,110
我誤導了所有人
I have misled all of them.

1144
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:47,750
我拋家棄子
I have abandoned my family.

1145
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:50,920
卻辜負了你
I have failed you.

1146
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:59,010
我並不是自認為的那樣
I'm not what I thought I was.

1147
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,220
那是什麼  
What is it?

1148
02:01:57,730 --> 02:01:59,400
洋流
The current.

1149
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:04,190
水流很急
It's strong.

1150
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:13,750
我們要涉過去
We need to cross here.

1151
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:19,420
現在就涉過去  
We need to cross now!

1152
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:25,170
我們從這過去
We cross here.

1153
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,550
我們從這過去  
We cross here!

1154
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,460
大家準備  
Ready yourselves!

1155
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,630
我們從這過去  
We cross here!

1156
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:33,590
快去告訴他們  去  
Go tell them! Go!

1157
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,720
你的命令  
Your orders...

1158
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:37,690
就像是埃及人的皮鞭
Are like the lash of the Egyptian whip.

1159
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:41,100
我們不再是奴隸
We are no longer slaves.

1160
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:43,520
你們尚未自由
And yet, you are not free.

1161
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:46,070
你看不到
You have lost sight...

1162
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:47,990
你們先祖之地  
Of canaan...

1163
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:50,900
迦南  
Land of your forebears.

1164
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:54,570
你們賜予我信任
You have honored me...

1165
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:57,120
我深感榮幸
With your trust.

1166
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,090
現在我賜予你們我的信仰
Now I honor you with my faith.

1167
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,000
跟隨我  你們終將自由  
Follow me and you will be free!

1168
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:09,090
留下則會滅亡
Stay and you will perish.

1169
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:13,350
不用害怕  
Do not be afraid!

1170
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:16,560
上帝與我們同在  
God is with us!

1171
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:18,820
走  大家準備  
Go! Ready yourselves!

1172
02:03:19,690 --> 02:03:20,730
走  
Go!

1173
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:22,520
上帝與我們同在  
God is with us!

1174
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:26,600
傳話出去  我們從這過去  
Pass the word! We cross here!

1175
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:29,230
盡快收拾好你們的東西  
As quickly as you can, gather your things...

1176
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:31,230
站成一隊  
And form in groups!

1177
02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:36,830
快  
Quickly!

1178
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:46,510
快點  
Come on!

1179
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:36,510
穩住  
Steady!

1180
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:44,680
靠右  靠右  貼緊  
To the right, to the right! Tight!

1181
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,800
繼續前進  
Keep moving!

1182
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,880
沒什麼好害怕的  
There's nothing to fear!

1183
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,940
別擔心  你們很安全  
Don't worry! You'll be safe!

1184
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:46,620
靠右  靠右  
Keep to the right! Keep to the right!

1185
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,420
拉美西斯  
Ramses!

1186
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:27,330
停  
Stop!

1187
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:53,100
停  停  
Stop! Stop!

1188
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:13,090
走
Go.

1189
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:16,720
繼續前進  
Keep moving!

1190
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:19,670
繼續前進  前進  
Keep moving! Forward!

1191
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,160
那裡
There.

1192
02:08:12,190 --> 02:08:13,190
耶和華  
Joshua!

1193
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:15,200
亞倫  
Aaron!

1194
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:31,880
跑  
Run!

1195
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,210
大家跑啊  
Everyone, run!

1196
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:34,830
跑  
Move!

1197
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:36,380
跑到海邊  
Run to shore!

1198
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,760
摩西
Moshe.

1199
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,410
摩西
Moshe.

1200
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,740
我們必須離開  
We must leave!

1201
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,330
拉美西斯  
Ramses!

1202
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:41,090
拉美西斯  
Ramses!

1203
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,420
沖  
Go!

1204
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:49,100
拉美西斯  停  
Ramses, stop!

1205
02:10:56,810 --> 02:11:00,100
所有人  掉頭  
All! Turn around!

1206
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:02,900
掉頭  
Turn around!

1207
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:04,850
錫安  
Khyan!

1208
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:13,080
離開
Leave.

1209
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:14,360
弟弟  
Brother...

1210
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:16,320
馬上離開  這是命令  
Leave now! That's an order!

1211
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:44,480
來呀  你回不了頭了  
Come! You'll never make it back!

1212
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:04,550
沖
Go!

1213
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:12,890
快  
Faster!

1214
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:34,770
這只有我
It's just me here.

1215
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:44,820
坐
Sit.

1216
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:53,720
我的家裡  
My family...

1217
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,300
離這不遠
Is not far from here.

1218
02:14:55,340 --> 02:14:56,340
你的家人  
Your family?

1219
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:58,840
我另外個家  我妻子和孩子
My other family. My wife, my son.

1220
02:15:00,350 --> 02:15:02,270
我在想  
I was thinking...

1221
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:04,770
或許我能說服他們  
Maybe I could convince them...

1222
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,190
說服他們加入我們  但或許  
Convince them to join us, but perhaps that's...

1223
02:15:09,730 --> 02:15:10,940
那不是明智之舉
Perhaps that's not wise.

1224
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:13,020
他們當然應該過來
Of course they should come.

1225
02:15:13,070 --> 02:15:14,530
我們還有很長的路要走
We have a long way to go.

1226
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:16,610
路長夢多
A lot can happen.

1227
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:18,610
如果  
And then...

1228
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:21,450
如果我們到了那
We get there, if we get there.

1229
02:15:21,490 --> 02:15:23,370
你覺得他們會讓我們定居在迦南嗎  
You don't think they'll let us settle in canaan?

1230
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:26,370
他們會視我們為入侵者
They'll see us as invaders.

1231
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:30,410
他們別無選擇  我們比任何部落的人都多
They won't have a choice. We're as big as any tribe.

1232
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:33,060
我們的人數可以匹敵一個國家  反倒讓我更擔心
We're as big as a nation of tribes and that concerns me even more.

1233
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:34,750
為什麼  
Why?

1234
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:38,420
這麼多人  
This many people?

1235
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:40,520
你還用問  
You have to ask?

1236
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:44,940
但我們目標一致
But we all have the same goal.

1237
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:46,010
現在是
We do now.

1238
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:49,520
但不再逃亡以後呢  
What happens when we stop running?

1239
02:16:14,210 --> 02:16:15,620
偉大的  
Ramses...

1240
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:19,210
拉美西斯
The great.

1241
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,390
謝謝
Thank you.

1242
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,210
革舜
Gershom.

1243
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:50,930
你按你說的做了嗎  
Did you do what you said?

1244
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:54,010
我說什麼了  
What did I say?

1245
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:58,030
你願意犧牲你的信仰  
That you would trade your faith...

1246
02:17:59,570 --> 02:18:01,030
來維護我的信仰
To keep me.

1247
02:18:02,030 --> 02:18:03,530
沒有
No.

1248
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:08,190
很好
Good.

1249
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:11,280
現在你更需要堅信你的信仰
You may need it more than ever now.

1250
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:26,210
他們是誰  
Who are they?

1251
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,050
他們是我的人民
They're my people.

1252
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:39,890
是誰讓你幸福  
Who makes you happy?

1253
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:43,310
你啊
You do.

1254
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:47,650
你生命中什麼最重要  
What is the most important thing in your life?

1255
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:50,400
你啊
You are.

1256
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:52,610
你啊
You are.

1257
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:58,410
你何時離我而去  
When will I leave you?

1258
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,750
永遠不會
Never.

1259
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,020
我能繼續嗎  
May I proceed?

1260
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:13,690
繼續吧
Proceed.

1261
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,110
你覺得這個怎麼樣  
What do you think of this?

1262
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:42,650
要是不同意  
I wouldn't do it...

1263
02:20:42,690 --> 02:20:44,280
我也不會這麼做
If I didn't agree.

1264
02:20:46,190 --> 02:20:47,940
沒錯
That's true.

1265
02:20:48,610 --> 02:20:50,570
我注意到你
I've noticed that about you.

1266
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:53,950
並不總能同意我
You don't always agree with me.

1267
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:58,030
我注意到  你也是
Nor you me, I've noticed.

1268
02:20:58,540 --> 02:21:01,960
但我們仍在這  說著話
Yet here we are, still speaking.

1269
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:04,380
可惜說不了太久
But not for much longer.

1270
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:10,090
領袖會更迭  
A leader can falter...

1271
02:21:10,130 --> 02:21:11,540
但石頭  
But stone...

1272
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:14,430
永不腐朽
Will endure.

1273
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:17,220
這些法律會代替你引領他們
These laws will guide them in your stead.

1274
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:21,640
如果你不同意  
If you disagree...

1275
02:21:22,230 --> 02:21:24,610
就該把錘子放下
You should put down the hammer.
