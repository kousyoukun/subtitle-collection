1
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,434
It's true,
the Hittite army

2
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,183
has 16,000 troops
camped outside Kadesh.

3
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,348
What's less clear is why,

4
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,609
The Hittites are trying
to cross the border.

5
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,110
Obviously.

6
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,113
What else would
they be doing?

7
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,447
Anticipating an invasion by
us, according to our information.

8
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,111
They think we are...

9
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,826
preparing an attack,
which we are not.

10
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,367
What I don't want to do, and
won't do, is sit here.

11
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,036
And wait until we're
fighting Hittite armies."

12
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,331
outside the palace walls,

13
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,965
Come,

14
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,892
What do the entrails say'?

15
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,182
They don't
"say" anything,

16
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,847
They imply!

17
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,185
And that's open
to interpretation.

18
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,690
So, interpret them.

19
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,269
We'll win or we won!
In a preemptive attack?

20
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,403
It's a yes or a no.

21
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,902
And it's not clear.

22
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,075
But something else is.

23
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,588
In the battle,
a leader will be saved.

24
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,750
and his savior
will someday lead.

25
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,471
Then the entrails
should also say.

26
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,472
that we will
abandon reason.

27
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,384
and be guided by omens.

28
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,189
Great Sekhmet...

29
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,689
Pharaoh drinks
in your name.

30
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:54,030
and prays for victory
over the Hittites at Kadesh.

31
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,870
Your first order of business when
the time comes, you retire her,

32
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,374
I will.

33
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,456
I don't know why
my father hasn't,

34
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,330
But, just in case...

35
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,842
if you see me in any real danger
out there, ride the other way.

36
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,174
I'm serious,

37
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,516
<i>When</i> I <i>look at you
I stiff see the two boys--.</i>

38
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,349
who grew up together,
close as brothers.

39
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,021
If, for any reason.

40
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,602
you ever forget that.

41
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,684
let these remind you,

42
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,522
Long enough to be effective
from horseback...

43
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,531
Not so long that
you trip over them,

44
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,701
This is his.
You've got mine,

45
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,362
That's right.
That's how I want it.

46
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,700
You have each other's

47
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,699
to keep each other safe,

48
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,367
Promise me you'll do that...

49
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,536
always.

50
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,704
Oh...

51
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,261
Seti! Seti! Seti!

52
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,644
Seti!

53
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,004
There!

54
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,859
Deploy Amun division
to the north,

55
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,152
Ra division to the center.

56
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,655
and Ptah to the south.
And we hold Seth in reserve.

57
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,524
In reserve?

58
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,700
Yes.

59
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,700
We should concentrate
our strength in the center.

60
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,703
You should concentrate
yours on fighting.

61
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,710
Leave the generalship
to me.

62
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,110
Fire!

63
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,746
Fire!

64
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,445
Charge!

65
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,096
Take Ramses! Go!

66
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,856
Go!

67
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:34,119
Turn around! Turn around!

68
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:55,136
Moses! Moses! Moses!

69
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,361
Moses,

70
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,148
What happened out there?

71
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,318
Nothing,

72
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,284
I asked the commanders the same thing.
They, too, lied,

73
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,989
And I'm tired of it.

74
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,534
He thinks something happened,

75
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,328
But it didn't
- Meaning?

76
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,047
The High Priestess,
her prophecy.

77
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,208
She said she couldn't see
who would win.

78
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,720
The other one.
"The leader will be saved..."

79
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,300
and so on.

80
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,012
You saved my son's life?

81
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,345
Yes.

82
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,852
Sit.

83
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,860
"Thank you" is
not sufficient...

84
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,688
but thank you,

85
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,859
I know you don't believe
in omens or prophecies,

86
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,902
but I do believe.

87
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,912
And I respect that.

88
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,581
But this isn't anything,

89
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,084
This doesn't
even make any sense,

90
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,870
Because you're not
my blood.

91
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,334
Yes.

92
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,043
It's true,
you can't succeed me,

93
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,503
Not in the usual way,

94
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,092
Not in any way,

95
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,383
In any way imaginable,
sitting here.

96
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,722
It's horrible to say this
about one's own son...

97
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,229
but I trust you
more than him to lead.

98
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,606
The Hittite chariotry...

99
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,446
crashed through our defense
and began its attack.

100
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,573
I found myself
surrounded by the enemy...

101
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,873
no soldier,
no shield-bearer...

102
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,576
facing a desperate
fight for my life.

103
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,749
Only with
the help of the gods,

104
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,252
did I defeat
our attackers...

105
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,542
and rejoin Ra division.

106
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,255
Stop there.

107
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,798
Anything you'd
like to rephrase?

108
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>No,</i>

109
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,684
Shall I go on?

110
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,886
No, I'm sure the rest is fine.

111
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,311
What's next?

112
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,597
Pithom.

113
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,765
What about it?

114
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,650
The situation. The slaves,

115
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,611
Fine. Ramses,

116
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,396
What?

117
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,031
Go up there,
meet with the viceroy,

118
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,449
look around, make <i>a</i> report,

119
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,902
Me?

120
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,119
It will be yours someday,
Take an interest in it.

121
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,285
What else?

122
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,136
I'll go to see the viceroy.

123
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,592
No.

124
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,466
I'll go.

125
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,097
It's beneath you,

126
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,478
It's beneath any general.

127
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,805
<i>I'll do it,</i>

128
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,311
Ramses...

129
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,984
can we forget
what happened...

130
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,940
on the battlefield?

131
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,151
If our positions
had been reversed...

132
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,031
I would've saved
your life, too,

133
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,113
I know. I know,

134
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,336
It was a good shot,

135
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,669
Even if the gods
did guide your aim

136
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,176
A little venom in your
blood is a good thing.

137
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,973
Makes you less vulnerable
to the next poisonous bite,

138
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,141
Maybe even my father's.

139
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,559
Welcome to Pithom,

140
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,405
You get used to the smell.

141
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,458
The viceroy seems to be enjoying
a good share of his resources,

142
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,219
This isn't a job everyone
wants to do, my lord.

143
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,554
A certain degree of comfort is
necessary to keep up his spirits,

144
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,263
You know
what the problem is?

145
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,474
People live too long
these days.

146
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,602
Every year, the death rate lags
further behind the birth rate.

147
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,812
And these people...

148
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,733
they reproduce
like it's a sport.

149
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,243
This is the problem?
A growing workforce?

150
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,904
Oh, no. No, of course not.
It's good for production.

151
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,574
Of course it is,
but only to a point.

152
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,994
When that population
wants you dead...

153
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,161
yes, it's a problem,

154
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:22,672
So, either I'm given more
troops to maintain order.

155
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,335
Or I start
thinning out the herd,

156
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,504
You start
slaughtering people...

157
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,471
for no reason other than
this precarious theory...

158
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,512
you will provoke the very thing
you say you wish to avoid.

159
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,477
Fine,
then give me the troops.

160
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,642
Let's go down
and talk to them,

161
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,856
Why on earth?

162
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,066
You're worried
about sedition.

163
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,364
Let's find out if
that worry is real.

164
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,775
By talking to them?

165
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,994
By looking at them...

166
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,449
when I talk with them,

167
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,161
You can tell <i>a</i> lot
about somebody,

168
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,996
looking him in the eye,

169
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,669
Well, let me
tell you something...

170
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,334
about Hebrews,

171
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,167
They are a conniving,
combative people.

172
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,337
Do you know what
"Israelite" means...

173
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,595
in their own language?

174
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,007
"He who fights with God!'

175
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,517
"He who wrestles with God."

176
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,303
There is a difference.

177
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,559
I may not be as
educated as you,

178
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,515
which, apparently,
you want to remind me of.

179
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,526
But I have to
deal with them every day.

180
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,107
I know what I'm talking about,

181
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,648
You don't have to come.
I'll go down there myself,

182
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,983
Stop!

183
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,027
Why is he being punished?

184
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,239
Persistent troublemaker,
my lord.

185
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,696
Why is he smiling?

186
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,247
He says he feels
no pain, my lord.

187
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,872
Then why whip him?

188
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,674
You were not
gathered up at random.

189
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,842
I asked to see...

190
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,595
the elders,

191
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,065
Come on.
What do you pray for?

192
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,276
We pray to see Canaan again.

193
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,435
Canaan again?

194
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,694
You've never seen it.

195
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,696
I've seen Canaan,

196
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,449
I've seen that it's inhabited by
tribes fiercer than Egypt's military.

197
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,110
So, you won't be
returning to it...

198
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,528
or, if you do, from it.

199
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,447
- God says otherwise.
- Which god?

200
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,785
Your god?
The God of Abraham?

201
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,621
The god that says
that you are special?

202
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,784
That you are chosen?

203
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,168
Come here. Up.

204
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,453
Come here,

205
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,752
He's wrong,

206
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,515
I can see you're unconvinced,
and that's a problem.

207
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,719
Because next to unrealistic
belief lies fanaticism...

208
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,104
and next to that, sedition,
and next to that, revolution.

209
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,856
And it all starts
with the elders

210
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,978
What's your name?

211
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,104
What's yours?

212
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,609
I'll tell you.

213
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,239
I am Moses, son of Bithia...

214
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,150
grandson of Horemheb.

215
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,290
Record this one's name
and the rest of them.

216
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,372
Bring in the next group,

217
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,538
My name is Nun,

218
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:52,968
My lord!

219
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,511
Stop there!
Let him through.

220
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,719
There's something
the elder has to tell you.

221
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,384
But not here,

222
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,642
Say where and when.

223
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,265
The prayer house, tonight,

224
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,851
Here,

225
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,283
I see you've
survived your adventure

226
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,906
Sorry to make
you wait again,

227
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,786
I'm not waiting.

228
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,413
How was your
trip to the quarry?

229
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,536
Fine.

230
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,745
You saw what I'm up against,

231
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,871
Mmm.

232
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,119
Tell me...

233
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,329
is there any
more of my records

234
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,039
I could get for
you before you leave?

235
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,378
You can tell me...

236
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,512
has all of this
been reported to Memphis?

237
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,093
Was it approved?
Do you have it in writing?

238
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,304
Of course. It's on record,

239
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,935
So you don't mind
if we check?

240
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,643
Of course I don't mind,

241
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,811
Bu! I don't understand
what's gone wrong.

242
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,897
Have I done something
to displease you?

243
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,280
And if so, is there any way
I could please you?

244
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,825
You can stop
living like a king.

245
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,069
You're not one.

246
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,509
...and you will occupy
the land of Canaan.

247
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,423
Canaan is already occupied,

248
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,550
God promises
we will return.

249
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,805
In chains or in coffins?

250
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,304
As free men...

251
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,015
into a land flowing
with milk and honey,

252
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,362
Can they at least
wait outside?

253
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,655
We're not dangerous,

254
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,316
Wait by the horses.

255
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,287
Do you believe in coincidence?

256
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,161
As much as anything else.

257
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,201
I don't think this is one.

258
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,368
What isn't?

259
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,122
You coming to Pithom,

260
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,335
Why did you come?

261
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,623
Business,

262
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,795
Sit.

263
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:50,888
Who's your father?

264
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,016
I know you don't
know his name...

265
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,026
only that he was a general
in Pharaoh's army...

266
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,313
unnamed by your mother,

267
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,732
I can see this is making
you uncomfortable,

268
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,277
This will interest you

269
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,946
There was no general.

270
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,410
Your mother...

271
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,621
the woman you call your
mother, has no children.

272
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,082
You were born a slave.

273
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,996
Don't go. Don't go.

274
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,915
It's better for you that I do,

275
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,209
I'm leaving.

276
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:25,131
If you leave now,
you'll just come back,

277
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,850
because you know somethings wrong.
You've always felt it.

278
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,054
Please.

279
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,394
Everybody out,

280
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,358
Out,

281
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,076
The year of your birth.

282
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,583
there was a prophecy that
our leader would be born...

283
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,585
to liberate us
from our bondage,

284
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,247
And so, there was an edict
from Memphis...

285
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,839
to kill every
firstborn Hebrew boy,

286
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,757
Your parents didn't wait
for that to happen.

287
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:09,558
Any chance of your survival
was better than no chance.

288
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,220
They handed you
to your sister.

289
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:17,267
She took you in a basket
to the banks of the river...

290
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,437
and she floated you
to where she knew...

291
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,776
Pharaoh Paramesse's daughter,
Bithia, bathed.

292
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,614
Bithia took you and your
sister, Miriam, as a maid...

293
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,699
and raised you <i>as</i> her own.

294
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,786
She probably
even loved you...

295
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,791
but she never told you,

296
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,619
or anyone else, the truth.

297
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,962
You are Hebrew,

298
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,131
The truth?

299
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,422
The truth is,

300
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,424
it's not even
that good a story.

301
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,764
And I thought you people
were meant to be...

302
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,051
good storytellers.

303
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,156
You, slave.

304
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,652
You!

305
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,082
Do you expect a reward
for this information?

306
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,916
Our reward is being
of service to you,

307
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,005
That said, if there were...

308
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,421
some token you had in mind
beyond that...

309
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,347
we wouldn't refuse it.

310
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,058
Well, how about this, then?

311
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,265
What about
if I don't kill you?

312
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,231
Hmm? That would be
sufficient payment,

313
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,109
You people.

314
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,443
Please leave.

315
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,150
Please.

316
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,324
How did it go'?

317
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,788
We can talk about
that another time.

318
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,328
We can talk about it now...

319
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,589
if only as <i>a</i> respite from this
army of grim-faced physicians.

320
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,469
Sit.

321
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,013
We're taking a thorough look
at the city records.

322
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,772
and the man is
clearly a thief.

323
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:47,481
It's one of life's
more depressing ironies...

324
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,316
that the men
who crave power.

325
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,855
are best fitted
to acquire it,

326
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,815
and least fitted
to exercise it.

327
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,663
What's wrong, Moses?

328
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,827
You're sick.

329
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,668
Something else
is troubling you,

330
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,503
I can tell,

331
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,832
No, nothing else.

332
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,863
May you be alert...

333
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,361
rejuvenated and
protected by the gods,

334
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,701
every moment of
your eternal life.

335
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,549
And to the left,

336
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,590
No, your left,

337
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,130
More, more, more.

338
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,593
Good,

339
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,471
It is tall,

340
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,976
Monuments are monuments...

341
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,388
for a reason. They inspire.

342
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,897
Inspire what,
in this case?

343
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,353
In this,
and in every case, power,

344
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,778
Say it out loud,
whatever it is.

345
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,278
The Viceroy of Pithom
is outside.

346
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,741
He's not on the agenda.

347
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,285
Well, he can go back
to Pithom until he is.

348
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,950
No, we should
deal with this.

349
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,493
Bring him in,

350
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,341
If you came here to beg
the new king's forgiveness...

351
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,432
it won't work,

352
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,010
Arrest him,

353
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,302
Oh. Wait, please.

354
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,850
May I at least respond?

355
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,185
I beg you,

356
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,975
It's in your interest.

357
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,942
You make it short.

358
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,019
I will...

359
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,321
to the king alone,

360
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,156
My advice is that...

361
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,989
he, and the other generals,
also leave the room.

362
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,322
Really?

363
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,286
That's your advice?

364
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,582
<i>Hmm.</i>

365
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,626
Well,
you are not his adviser,

366
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,038
Oh, that's right.
You are.

367
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,206
That's right,

368
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,878
Moses,

369
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,129
Moses,

370
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,009
Everybody but the Viceroy.

371
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,553
out,

372
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,369
Terrible news,

373
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,872
There you are,

374
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,454
So...

375
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,585
Mmm?

376
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,836
The Viceroy.

377
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,709
You didn't arrest him,

378
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,346
You didn't take
your Chief Advisor's advice,

379
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,717
No, he came. Uh...

380
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,813
He told me of an incident
involving two guards.

381
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,065
One of which
survived the attack,

382
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,193
And I told him
I did not care.

383
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,026
And then, he told me
the most unbelievable story.

384
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,866
Told to him, he said,
by very reliable sources.

385
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,572
Then, when pressed...

386
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,039
he admitted that
they were Hebrew spies.

387
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,749
You know what
I'm talking about,

388
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,251
Yes.

389
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,542
And what do you make of it?

390
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,170
I think it's offensive,
and I think it's ridiculous.

391
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,585
Yes, Yes!

392
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,424
You, of all people, a Hebrew.

393
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,594
And I said.

394
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,594
How can I believe
such a story?

395
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,100
Cousin.

396
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,598
you can't,

397
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,359
What if I take the chance
of not believing it, Moses?

398
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,776
What am I to do?

399
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,941
Bithia!

400
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,746
Mother,

401
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:52,952
The man is a thief,

402
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,373
My son discovers this,

403
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,992
Not you.

404
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,999
And he reports it
to your father,

405
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,375
who would have
hanged this thief,

406
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,456
if he hadn't
been dying himself,

407
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,296
You believe his feeble,
self-serving lies.

408
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,961
All I want to know
is if it is true.

409
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,549
I didn't ask for a tirade,

410
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,257
To talk about
this any longer...

411
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,640
would dignify it...

412
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,767
and I won't do that.

413
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:13,934
Answer the question,

414
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,721
Yes or no?

415
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,979
Was I talking to you?

416
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,435
Bring her in. Bring her in,

417
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,317
Now!

418
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,570
Miriam!

419
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,069
Come. Sit down,

420
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,615
Now, I'm going to
ask you some things...

421
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,577
that are going to seem
very strange to you.

422
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,616
I just would like you
to answer them truthfully,

423
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,661
How do you know Moses?

424
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,085
You know how I know him...

425
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,584
and you,

426
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,720
I helped raise you both,

427
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,639
So you are not
his sister, then?

428
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,759
Of course not,

429
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,724
And you're not a Hebrew.

430
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,229
<i>No,</i>

431
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,610
Place your arm on the table.

432
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,981
Ramses

433
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,149
Don't be stupid!

434
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,656
I am not talking to you!

435
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,409
I am talking to her,

436
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,794
Your whole arm
on the table, Miriam.

437
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,416
Thank you,

438
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,923
Ramses...

439
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,213
don't take this any further.

440
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,300
Don't take this
any further, or what?

441
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,427
Do not take this
any further.

442
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,843
Are you quite sure
about that?

443
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,683
Gel your hand off it,
or use it, now.

444
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:43,567
Or perhaps you'd like
to answer the question?

445
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,403
Then I'll proceed,

446
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,444
Miriam, I'm going
to ask you again,

447
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,828
and if your answer
is again no...

448
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,952
I apologize for
what happens next.

449
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,414
Are you his sister?

450
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,708
<i>No,</i>

451
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,179
Yes!

452
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,348
Yes!

453
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,638
You don't need <i>a</i> reason to
kill him, but you have one.

454
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,473
This was treason.
- How was it treason?

455
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,761
He just admitted he knew,

456
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,306
That wasn't an admission!

457
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,979
Simply did not want
her arm lopped off!

458
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,854
I saw it in his eyes,

459
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,815
He does not
believe this story.

460
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,656
I don't want to believe it!

461
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,536
You want to believe it,
because it's an opportunity

462
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,703
to be rid of him

463
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,864
which you always wanted,

464
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,284
I didn't say "exiled,"
I said "dead."

465
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,880
That, I'm sure,
will follow...

466
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,460
where he's going,

467
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,350
Khyan...

468
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,306
allow me to talk to my mother,

469
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,392
Yes, sir, yes,

470
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,910
Come, Miriam.

471
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,628
It isn't every man
who would protect

472
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,502
a servant who's nothing
more to him than that.

473
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,508
Certainly no one
else in this family,

474
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,214
including me,

475
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:20,052
I wouldn't have said
what he wanted to hear,

476
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,431
And neither would she,

477
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,394
That's how much
we love you.

478
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,564
"We"?

479
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,278
It's not true,

480
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,538
It is true,

481
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,534
You were wearing this when I
brought you to the river.

482
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,122
I took it off you
for obvious reasons.

483
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,002
That's you,

484
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,046
The connection between
you and our mother.

485
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,764
Your sister saved your life,

486
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,939
Now you saved hers,

487
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:10,932
Moshe,

488
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,467
Miriam,

489
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,068
Sorry, sir.

490
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,242
Moses!

491
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,491
Moses!

492
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,032
I have nothing to steal,

493
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,947
My horse is dead.

494
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,707
We're not here for
your horse, Moshe.

495
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,622
A little bit higher.

496
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,645
Hey! Whoa.
What are you doing?

497
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,730
Don't stop.
Keep working.

498
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,641
You, get water for our goats.

499
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,779
Psst. You,

500
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,206
Wait your turn.

501
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:55,091
Move your animals
away from the troughs,

502
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,104
It's yours again,

503
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,050
Where are you from?

504
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,553
West of here,

505
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,051
Where are you going?

506
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:41,966
East,

507
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,309
What did you do?

508
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,221
What do you mean'?

509
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,900
You committed some crime?

510
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,105
With respect,

511
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,905
your daughters
invited me for some food,

512
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,363
They did not tell me there
would be an interrogation.

513
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,989
I'm sorry.

514
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,574
I'm just curious,

515
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,751
You are welcome to get
cleaned up before dinner...

516
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,910
if that appeals to you...

517
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,203
and stay the night
if you want.

518
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,674
before continuing on...

519
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,675
to wherever it is.

520
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,086
Thank you.

521
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,279
Describe Memphis to someone...

522
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,447
who's never been there
and never will.

523
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,241
It's..

524
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,415
I don't want to
say "civilized"..

525
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,751
because I don't want to
offend, but it is civilized,

526
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,794
There's more there
than sheep and goats,

527
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,296
There's more here than that.

528
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,135
Really? Where?

529
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,635
I'm sorry,
that was rude.

530
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,395
That was rude,

531
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,806
I'm not ignorant
just because I live here,

532
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,770
Hmm- I can see that.

533
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,565
I can tell you one thing.

534
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,823
This is by far

535
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,322
the nicest place...

536
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,908
between here and there,

537
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,957
And so you're leaving?

538
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,459
Of course,

539
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,995
There's nothing here
for someone like me,

540
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,625
When?

541
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,461
Today?

542
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,397
Remember
this moment in time...

543
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,314
for after these vows...

544
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,608
you shall say to the world...

545
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,655
"This is my husband."
"This is my wife."

546
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,282
I, Zipporah..,

547
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,541
I, Moses...

548
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,202
- accept you, Zipporah
- accept you, Moses...

549
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,289
...to be no other
than yourself.

550
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,212
Loving what I know of you...

551
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,344
trusting what I
do not yet know,

552
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,301
With respect,

553
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,549
for your integrity...

554
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,093
and faith...

555
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,012
in your abiding love for me

556
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,440
<i>In all that life
may bring us...</i>

557
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,691
<i>I pledge my love.</i>

558
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,193
<i>I pledge my love</i>

559
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,195
Who makes you happy?

560
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,274
You do.

561
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,369
What's the most important
thing in your life?

562
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,871
You are,

563
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,414
Where would you rather be'?

564
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,748
Nowhere,

565
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,460
And when will you leave me?

566
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,971
Never,

567
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,474
Proceed.

568
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,108
I said per Se.

569
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,196
I don't want to
discuss my tomb, per se.

570
00:51:55,904 --> 00:52:00,000
I want to discuss why you seem to
want to discuss it all the time,

571
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,160
Respectfully...

572
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,708
it should have been your first
construction order on taking the throne.

573
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,624
It'll be a big project,
as you might imagine.

574
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,088
So is my house, apparently.

575
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,717
Is there a
problem with the palace?

576
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,388
It's not done.

577
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,265
It won't be long now,

578
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,223
You said that months ago. Meanwhile
I'm living there like...

579
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,103
a Bedouin,

580
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,647
Get it done,

581
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,817
Faster!

582
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,728
Or do I have to
kill somebody?

583
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,648
I think
you made your point.

584
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,244
Good throw, Father.

585
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,083
Just aim a little higher.

586
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,209
Almost.

587
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,293
Ugh,

588
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,178
Have you ever
been to the top?

589
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:03,931
<i>No,</i>

590
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,189
Would you like to?

591
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,940
Mother says it's forbidden,

592
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,104
By who?

593
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,155
Our god.

594
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,117
Our god...

595
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,362
stops us from
climbing mountains?

596
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,202
Not every mountain.

597
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,995
Just that one.

598
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,328
It's God's mountain.

599
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,020
You're confusing him,

600
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,813
I'm not trying to.

601
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,563
Is it good for our boy to
grow up believing in nothing?

602
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,735
Is it bad to grow up
believing in yourself?

603
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:58,986
It's my faith,

604
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,070
I know,

605
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,822
- And it's his, too.
- I understand.

606
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,832
He can make up his
mind when he's older,

607
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,538
- Yes,
- Just like you.

608
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,372
He's a lot like me already,

609
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,933
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

610
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,251
Moshe.

611
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,102
Help me!

612
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,779
I think my leg is broken

613
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,408
More than that.

614
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,238
What did you say?

615
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,455
Who are you?

616
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:16,915
Who are you?

617
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,964
I'm a shepherd.

618
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,092
I thought you were a general.

619
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,598
I need a general.

620
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,313
Why?

621
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,148
To fight,

622
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:38,687
Why else?

623
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,820
Fight who?

624
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,035
For what?

625
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:49,498
I think you know

626
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,251
I think you should go and see

627
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,333
what's happening
to your people now,

628
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,127
He won't be at peace
until you do.

629
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,843
Or are they not people...

630
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,637
in your opinion?

631
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,512
Who are you?

632
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,361
I am.

633
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,328
<i>I am.</i>

634
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,347
You were hit on the head.

635
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,392
Anything you saw...

636
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,890
or think you saw afterwards...

637
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,304
was an effect of that.

638
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,893
The storm...

639
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:59,356
The storm started before
I was hit on the head.

640
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,565
It was not a storm,

641
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,645
Fine, fine.

642
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,530
The storm was something.

643
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,566
It was something else.

644
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,279
But the
boy was all in your head.

645
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,578
How do you know?

646
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,696
Because God isn't a boy!

647
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,328
Then what does he look like?

648
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,616
Describe him,

649
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,077
Describe him to
someone like me,

650
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,415
Do you know what
you sound like?

651
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:22,212
Yes. I sound delusional,

652
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,375
Yes.

653
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,218
Yes.

654
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,175
You just need more rest.

655
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,631
Yes, yes.

656
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,930
I have to
tell you something.

657
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,721
I have to tell you something.

658
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:41,064
I've not been
completely honest with you,

659
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,270
About what?

660
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,939
About who I am,

661
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,743
About what I've done
and who I was.

662
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,370
And how I feel.

663
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,198
About what you feel about me?

664
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:56,283
<i>No,</i>

665
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,495
No,
I've been honest about that.

666
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,799
Rest.

667
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,469
Rest.
- Don't leave me,

668
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,004
No. No,

669
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,649
Moshe,

670
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,045
Gershom?

671
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,886
What are you doing out here?

672
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,008
Nothing.

673
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,594
I can't sleep.

674
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,181
Are you worried about me?

675
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,725
Yes.

676
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,357
Don't,

677
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,443
I'll be fine.

678
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,244
What's that?

679
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,829
What's it look like?

680
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,912
Come inside,

681
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,998
Come inside!

682
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,737
What are you going to do
with all that?

683
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,872
Make sure I see you again,

684
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:03,418
Put it down and you can
see me forever.

685
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,099
What's this mean?

686
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,235
It's someone I used to know,

687
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,787
This is not forever.

688
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:44,042
I will see you again,

689
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,791
Do you believe me?

690
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,130
Good for you.

691
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,172
Don't ever just say
what people want to hear,

692
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,551
But I will

693
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,473
I will see you again,

694
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:12,108
Will you keep this for me?

695
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,235
Gershom,

696
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:19,195
Gershom, please look at me.

697
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,422
What kind of god
tells a man...

698
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,633
to leave his family?

699
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:41,763
If you understand it,
I'll understand it.

700
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:43,886
I don't,

701
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,729
<i>So</i> I can't
answer that question,

702
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,230
If that's what faith means,
I will trade mine...

703
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,895
To keep you,

704
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,700
Don't touch me,

705
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,498
<i>Go,</i>

706
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,955
Go!

707
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,524
Father, have you
some milk to spare?

708
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,112
Yes.

709
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,114
Where did you come from'?

710
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,865
I come from the sea,

711
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,664
It's a narrow
and dangerous path,

712
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,209
Thank you, Father,

713
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:50,618
Joshua.
I remember you.

714
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,666
Do you still feel no pain?

715
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,666
Keep your eye
on the horse.

716
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:16,890
Thank you.

717
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,974
Welcome back, brother.

718
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,604
Aaron...

719
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,147
your brother.

720
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,199
Ithamar.

721
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,536
Ithamar, this...

722
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,115
is your famous Uncle Moses,

723
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,084
He was once
a prince of Egypt,

724
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,783
I'm fine.

725
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:14,747
Everybody's fine.

726
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,954
You sleep so well,
my boy...

727
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,326
because you know
you are loved.

728
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,339
I've never slept so well,

729
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,985
I'm told
I should address you...

730
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:30,490
as Ramses the Great, now.

731
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,365
Moses...

732
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,704
you're alive,

733
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,911
I'm glad you're alive,
- Really?

734
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,039
Is that why you only sent
two assassins to kill me?

735
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,911
My mother,

736
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,121
Don't blame her,

737
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,330
Yes, she wanted you dead.

738
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:50,047
Who do you think hid your sword
where you would find it?

739
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,922
Moses,

740
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,427
I'm not here...

741
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,522
to take your throne

742
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,227
It's not about the prophecy
that worries you so much.

743
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,518
This is something else.

744
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,903
I have been told...

745
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,358
that things here
have become...

746
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,610
much worse,

747
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:19,243
Things are better than
they ever have been, Moses,

748
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,282
<i>No,</i>

749
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,454
We have order.

750
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:23,910
Order?

751
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,128
The slaves...

752
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,045
their bodies burn
night and day now,

753
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,926
I've seen it
with my own eyes,

754
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,087
You call that order?

755
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,300
They're slaves,

756
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,718
No, they're not.
What would you expect?

757
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,508
They're Egyptians, they should
be treated as Egyptians,

758
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,097
They should have
the same rights...

759
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,761
they should be
paid for their work..,

760
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,851
or you must set them free,

761
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,357
They are not Egyptians,

762
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:49,394
They are slaves, Moses.
What else do you expect?

763
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,732
They wouldn't
know what to do...

764
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,655
if all of a sudden
they were left

765
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,274
to fend for themselves
like animals.

766
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,784
Do not call them animals!

767
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:02,282
Listen, from an economic
standpoint alone,

768
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,791
what you're asking...

769
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,419
is problematic
to say the least,

770
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:11,800
I didn't expect to
hear a simple yes,

771
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,588
But I do not want
to hear a simple no.

772
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,471
Is that what you are telling me?
Are you saying no?

773
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,724
I'm not saying no.

774
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,134
I'm saying time,

775
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,436
Time.

776
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,388
You're listening to Hebrews,

777
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:26,647
I'm not listening to Hebrews,

778
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,442
Who are you talking to?

779
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:31,982
God,

780
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,322
God,

781
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,904
Which god?

782
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:04,643
You're not seriously
considering his proposal,

783
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,349
Well, is it a proposal?

784
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,267
If a man is holding a dagger
to your throat, Minister?

785
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,855
Is it?
- I stand corrected.

786
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,024
That's a demand,

787
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,273
He has lost his mind.

788
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,535
He's found a god,
His god.

789
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,658
Not one of ours...

790
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,537
so I would like Moses...

791
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,047
I want Moses dead.

792
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,381
Did you hear me?

793
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,212
Yes.

794
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,301
Then, go.

795
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:44,550
And...

796
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,059
his family, too,

797
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,409
Moses,

798
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,694
Where's Moses?

799
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,375
Moses? Where's Moses?

800
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,621
Moses...

801
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,294
his family,

802
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,800
Where are they?

803
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:25,068
This is not Moses,

804
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,077
This is not his family,

805
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:34,331
This is a man

806
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,336
his wife...

807
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,463
and his child...

808
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:42,673
who when asked the simple
question, "Where is he?"...

809
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:46,635
Answered, "We don't know."

810
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:02,029
Carry this image
home with you tonight...

811
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:04,611
and discuss why
you would protect him...

812
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:08,491
knowing that
tomorrow at this time...

813
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:11,452
there will be
another family.

814
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,867
where this one is.

815
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:16,252
And another the day after.

816
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,334
And the day after that.

817
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:23,843
Dare I say yours?

818
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,023
Go ahead,

819
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,485
I want to join the fight,

820
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,645
In there,

821
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,075
Joshua, use your knee,

822
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,331
It's good.

823
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:29,032
Both eyes open!

824
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,364
Nook! Draw!

825
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:32,862
Loose!

826
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,076
Advance,

827
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,707
Nook. Draw,

828
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:38,576
Loose!

829
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,244
Draw!

830
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,413
Loose!

831
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,415
Draw!

832
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,042
Loose!

833
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,341
Again!

834
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,517
There are
two kinds of warfare.

835
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,811
Each is dictated by numbers,

836
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,356
With greater numbers...

837
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,908
you attack the enemy
head on!

838
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,162
You stab it in the heart!

839
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,073
With fewer numbers,
you come at it from the side.

840
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,209
You cut off the blood...

841
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,161
that pumps the heart,

842
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,331
The army supply lines,

843
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:26,756
No!

844
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,842
The people's supply lines,

845
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,173
Their food...

846
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,838
their property...

847
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,677
their comfort.

848
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,091
What would that achieve?

849
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,721
Everything

850
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,012
Only the Egyptian people...

851
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,057
can force him
to accept our demands...

852
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:45,193
for freedom.
We must force them...

853
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,945
to make him say yes!

854
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,438
Yes?

855
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,860
Yes!

856
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,941
Yes?

857
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,526
Yes!

858
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:20,863
With me!

859
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,164
With me!

860
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,241
Ready.

861
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,906
You're not going
to do anything?

862
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,077
I didn't say that.

863
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,565
Where have you been?

864
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,071
Watching you fail,

865
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,736
Wars of attrition
take time.

866
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,234
At this rate,
you'll take years,

867
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,903
a generation,

868
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,739
I am prepared to
fight for that long.

869
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:28,616
I'm not,

870
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,413
I thought we were
making progress.

871
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,581
Now, you're impatient.

872
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:40,503
After 400 years of slavery.

873
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:46,263
Am I the only one sitting here who's
done nothing about this until now?

874
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,344
I do know...

875
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,888
a few things
about military action,

876
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,773
Still, if you're not going
to listen to me...

877
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,274
then why did you
take me away...

878
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:55,935
from my family?

879
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,437
I didn't.

880
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,405
You did.

881
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,612
You don't need me,

882
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,777
Maybe not,

883
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,122
So what do I do? Nothing?

884
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,291
For now...

885
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,252
you can watch,

886
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,516
Divine Goddess
Kebechet, I humbly call upon you...

887
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:01,276
to purify the waters
of our life-giving river,

888
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,952
How long will it take?

889
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:21,588
Not long.

890
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:27,757
But longer than that.

891
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:05,651
Ramses! Ramses!

892
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,019
Yes?

893
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:11,819
Enough!

894
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:13,526
Do something!

895
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:16,036
They're just frogs,

896
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,581
Back away, back away,

897
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:28,920
Unclean,

898
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,425
No, no, no. Don't drink.

899
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:31,585
Unclean,

900
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:07,584
The Nile, as we know, carries
a certain amount of clay,

901
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:10,090
This year there's much
more of it than usual...

902
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,592
drifting in on the currents,
settling on the riverbeds..,

903
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:16,346
and kicked up by the wild
thrashing of the crocodiles.

904
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:18,758
This thrashing not only...

905
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:22,349
dramatically changed the color of
the water, but it fouled it...

906
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,434
to the point of
killing the fish,

907
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,769
But frogs, as we know..,

908
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:29,981
can get out of the water,
when they have to.

909
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,770
Which they did.

910
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:34,531
But frogs still need water.

911
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,443
and when they can't find it
in the streets of our city.

912
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,619
they what? Hmm?

913
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,121
Oh, they die?

914
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,623
They die!

915
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:45,784
And then they decompose,

916
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,455
And then the gnats come and the
maggots come and the flies come.

917
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:52,457
And then...

918
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,469
And then what?

919
01:26:58,797 --> 01:26:59,844
The flies die,

920
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,177
Speak up.

921
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,012
It's in Hebrew.

922
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,105
Hebrew?

923
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,390
Read it.

924
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,900
These catastrophes...

925
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:53,769
are the work of God...

926
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,358
and they have not finished.
They will get worse.

927
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,073
We need to
reach a settlement.

928
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,825
for both our sakes

929
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,576
So, the work of God.

930
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:13,130
Here is
my settlement to you,

931
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,875
Work quotas
shall be doubled...

932
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,381
and you will get no straw...

933
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,295
to make your bricks,

934
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:22,510
Perhaps your god...

935
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:25,050
will provide it for you,

936
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,747
I was impressed at first.

937
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,216
Not anymore,

938
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,670
This is affecting everyone.

939
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,845
So, who are you punishing?

940
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:22,440
What's wrong with him?

941
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,325
It's sick

942
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:36,834
What is this?

943
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,840
Did you do this?
Not me.

944
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:40,171
Is this you?
No, no!

945
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,549
What's happened to him?

946
01:29:58,101 --> 01:29:59,478
Oh! Oh...

947
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:19,248
We have made great
strides in medicine.

948
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,587
However, there are
still a few hidden diseases

949
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:22,667
that we don't
completely understand.

950
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,800
Animals are not exempt,

951
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,431
and there is
some conjecture.

952
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,766
that these maladies can migrate
from the smallest creature.

953
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:33,891
Like a

954
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,182
A fly,

955
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,569
Have you been out
to the river lately?

956
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:47,359
I appealed to
Kebechet again,

957
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:50,196
and six more gods.

958
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,733
Is that it?

959
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:06,738
Are you done?

960
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,953
I am.

961
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:27,592
Are you trying to say
something with your absence?

962
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:32,214
Is it meant to humble me?

963
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,633
Because it will not!

964
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,209
Initial reports suggest...

965
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:46,872
more than 10 million square
cubits of crops have been lost.

966
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:50,630
The quartermaster has suggested
we return a portion...

967
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:53,045
of the supplement
to the civil granary.

968
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,222
An act of mercy,

969
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:58,634
Your people are starving,

970
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:02,729
Are you suggesting
that I should starve, too'?

971
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:04,389
<i>No,</i>

972
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:09,148
People have plenty of water,

973
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,563
They will endure,

974
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:49,976
Aim!

975
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:51,978
Fire!

976
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:58,155
Aim!

977
01:34:58,443 --> 01:34:59,444
Fire!

978
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:56,129
Is that you?

979
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:58,845
<i>Moses?</i>

980
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:02,181
Brother?

981
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:09,514
Have you come to negotiate?

982
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,860
Because I'm ready.

983
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,363
as I have an offer for you,

984
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,234
One more thing happens...

985
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:26,498
and I will bring
my own plague to you,

986
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:30,994
You see,
every Hebrew child,

987
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,037
not yet walking,

988
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,294
they never shall,

989
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:39,799
Because I will
drown them in the Nile.

990
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,173
As you should have been.

991
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:50,184
You say that you
didn't cause all this?

992
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,900
Your god did?

993
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:59,197
I am the god! I am the god!

994
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:07,576
So, let's just see who's
more effective at killing,

995
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,541
You,

996
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,335
This god.

997
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:15,922
Or me,

998
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:38,944
Nice of you to come,

999
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,357
He's given you
what you asked?

1000
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,871
Not yet. But his own people
are turning against him.

1001
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,032
- And his army?
- It will.

1002
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,917
I disagree,

1003
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:55,458
Something worse
has to happen.

1004
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,917
I disagree,

1005
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,375
Anything more would be...
- Would be what?

1006
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:01,633
What were you about to say?

1007
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:04,253
Cruel? inhumane?

1008
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:07,215
It's not easy to see...

1009
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:10,306
the people who I grew up
with suffering this much.

1010
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:12,436
What about the people
you didn't grow up with?

1011
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:13,972
What thought did
you give to them?

1012
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,734
You still don't think
of them as yours, do you?

1013
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:21,821
As long as Ramses
has an army behind him...

1014
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:23,735
nothing will change,

1015
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,491
Anything more
is just revenge!

1016
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,654
Revenge? After 400 years
of brutal subjugation?

1017
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:33,241
These Pharaohs who
imagine they're living gods,

1018
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,997
they're nothing more
than ﬂesh and blood,

1019
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:39,164
I want to see them on their
knees, begging for it to stop!

1020
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,833
I'm tired of talking
with a messenger!

1021
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,092
General!

1022
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:52,018
I have heard
Ramses final threat,

1023
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:54,474
So, let me tell you what's
going to happen next.

1024
01:38:57,682 --> 01:38:58,934
No, No,

1025
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,357
You cannot do this,

1026
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:03,692
I want no part of this!

1027
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:30,594
Stay!

1028
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:33,059
- Hold!
- Moses?

1029
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,267
Leave him,

1030
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,696
Khyan,

1031
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:47,068
Moses,

1032
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,207
I could have you killed.

1033
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:06,751
I don't think so.

1034
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,255
Unless you do it yourself.

1035
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:13,307
Your own soldiers
let me in.

1036
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,726
I am not
negotiating anymore,

1037
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:22,267
That's not why I'm here,

1038
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:27,610
I came to tell you
that something is coming,

1039
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,613
that is out of my control,

1040
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:33,779
Something that will
affect thousands...

1041
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:35,162
And thousands of citizens,

1042
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:37,494
And it will affect
you very personally

1043
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:40,167
unless you accept
what I've asked for...

1044
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:43,329
and announce it publicly...

1045
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:47,342
before the sun goes down.

1046
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:51,053
Ramses...

1047
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:54,637
do not turn your back on me!

1048
01:40:57,218 --> 01:41:01,689
This has nothing to
do with you and I.

1049
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:05,359
This is far beyond that.

1050
01:41:05,643 --> 01:41:08,362
This is about Egypt's
survival- Do you understand?

1051
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:15,995
Sunset,

1052
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,536
After that,
it will be too late,

1053
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:21,997
What will be too late?

1054
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,378
You protect your child,

1055
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:27,506
You protect
your child tonight,

1056
01:41:28,207 --> 01:41:29,834
My child?

1057
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,258
Is that a threat?

1058
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,853
Is that a threat? Moses!

1059
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:43,098
Moses!

1060
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:48,106
Tell everyone.

1061
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,364
to slaughter a Lamb...

1062
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,525
and mark their doors...

1063
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,202
and their
doorposts tonight...

1064
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,029
with its blood,

1065
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,286
Why?

1066
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:05,036
Pity the lambs if I am wrong,

1067
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:09,541
If I'm right,

1068
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:12,586
we will bless them
for eternity.

1069
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:34,234
Bennu? Bennu?

1070
01:45:25,402 --> 01:45:27,404
No!

1071
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:31,416
Ramses?

1072
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:34,454
Ramses,

1073
01:45:37,623 --> 01:45:39,091
Ramses,

1074
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:57,936
No!

1075
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:04,783
Zechariah?

1076
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,955
Zechariah?

1077
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:54,158
Kneel!

1078
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:14,394
Get out!

1079
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:16,768
Murderer!

1080
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,441
Child killer!

1081
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:33,869
Their children
died last night.

1082
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:36,875
As did mine,

1083
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,833
Is this your god?

1084
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:48,887
A killer of children?

1085
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:53,385
What kind of fanatics
worship such a god?

1086
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:03,235
No Hebrew child
died last night.

1087
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:24,839
Get...

1088
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:26,750
out,

1089
01:48:28,085 --> 01:48:29,712
<i>Go,</i>

1090
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:32,722
Every one of you!

1091
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:34,262
Go!

1092
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:38,937
Go to Canaan if
that's what you want,

1093
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,854
Back to the homeland
of your dreams.

1094
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,440
But go!

1095
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:50,862
As you command,

1096
01:49:02,828 --> 01:49:05,456
This is the route I took,

1097
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:08,258
From here,
we go south to the Red Sea,

1098
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:11,011
The straits are here. At low
tide, we can cross on foot.

1099
01:50:49,726 --> 01:50:52,696
You know why you
sleep so well, my boy?

1100
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:57,409
Because you know
you are loved.

1101
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,129
With respect...

1102
01:51:51,288 --> 01:51:53,916
if we're going to
recapture 400,000 slaves...

1103
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:56,756
we might need more
than three divisions.

1104
01:51:57,211 --> 01:51:59,305
We're not
recapturing anyone,

1105
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:00,672
Oh.

1106
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,347
Forward!

1107
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:44,550
We should rest.

1108
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:45,842
<i>No,</i>

1109
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:49,138
We're not safe
until we cross the sea,

1110
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,350
Moshe!

1111
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:56,603
Whoa!

1112
01:52:57,729 --> 01:52:59,276
Ramses...

1113
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:00,531
4,000 men...

1114
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:02,033
a thousand chariots,

1115
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:03,489
How far behind us?

1116
01:53:03,944 --> 01:53:05,196
Four days.

1117
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:07,285
Less, if they don't
rest the horses

1118
01:53:14,955 --> 01:53:16,081
Ramses!

1119
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:18,379
Ramses!

1120
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,794
We need to rest
the horses.

1121
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,508
and the men!

1122
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,318
The straits are that way,

1123
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:39,229
The longest,
easiest route...

1124
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:42,024
is down the western coast,

1125
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:47,322
Or we go through
the mountains.

1126
01:53:48,905 --> 01:53:50,122
The mountains?

1127
01:53:50,282 --> 01:53:53,752
Why? Why don't
we take that route?

1128
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:55,412
We can, but so can Ramses.

1129
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:59,257
The mountain passes
are dangerous...

1130
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:02,716
but they are too narrow
for Ramses chariots.

1131
01:54:02,878 --> 01:54:05,506
He couldn't follow. That
would give us needed time.

1132
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:08,600
What does God tell you?

1133
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:16,228
The mountains.

1134
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:19,562
Can we make it?

1135
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:27,077
Forward!

1136
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:09,903
Which way from here?

1137
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:14,700
Stay here.

1138
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:37,814
We need your help.

1139
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:47,612
I don't know where I am,

1140
01:56:11,715 --> 01:56:13,717
You won't help me?

1141
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:18,639
You won't help them,

1142
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:24,819
This way!

1143
01:56:28,523 --> 01:56:30,400
Move out!

1144
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:50,887
This way!

1145
01:56:53,215 --> 01:56:54,432
Are you sure?

1146
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,093
Oh, I'm very sure.

1147
01:56:57,260 --> 01:56:59,763
I mean, are you sure we can make
it across with our equipment...

1148
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:01,523
our chariots?

1149
01:57:01,973 --> 01:57:03,065
They didn't think
they could with theirs,

1150
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:07,316
How would they know?

1151
01:57:08,146 --> 01:57:09,568
They've never been here,

1152
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:11,153
Moses may have,

1153
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:54,951
Is this high tide
or low tide?

1154
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:56,703
Doesn't matter.

1155
01:57:58,113 --> 01:57:59,615
This isn't
the straits, is it?

1156
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:00,782
<i>No,</i>

1157
01:58:04,077 --> 01:58:05,420
Do you even know
where we are?

1158
01:58:05,662 --> 01:58:07,039
Yes!

1159
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:10,334
We're at a point on the earth
where there is <i>a</i> sea ahead...

1160
01:58:10,542 --> 01:58:12,169
and an army behind!

1161
01:58:12,335 --> 01:58:14,053
So now what?

1162
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:15,255
Army or no army...

1163
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:17,215
we have to rest.

1164
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:44,118
I have misled all of them,

1165
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:48,751
I have abandoned my family,

1166
01:58:50,248 --> 01:58:51,921
I have failed you,

1167
01:58:57,339 --> 01:59:00,013
I'm not what I thought I was,

1168
02:01:56,100 --> 02:01:57,226
What is it?

1169
02:01:58,728 --> 02:02:00,401
The current.

1170
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:05,197
It's strong.

1171
02:02:13,535 --> 02:02:14,752
We need to cross here,

1172
02:02:18,414 --> 02:02:20,416
We need to cross now!

1173
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:26,052
We cross here,

1174
02:02:26,214 --> 02:02:27,557
We cross here!

1175
02:02:28,842 --> 02:02:30,344
Ready yourselves!

1176
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:31,636
We cross here!

1177
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:34,473
Go tell them! Go!

1178
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:35,640
Your orders...

1179
02:02:35,765 --> 02:02:38,689
are like the lash
of the Egyptian whip,

1180
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,113
We are no longer slaves,

1181
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:44,532
And yet, you are not free,

1182
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:46,906
You have lost sight,

1183
02:02:47,944 --> 02:02:48,991
of Canaan...

1184
02:02:49,863 --> 02:02:51,911
land of your forebears.

1185
02:02:53,992 --> 02:02:55,585
You have honored me...

1186
02:02:56,369 --> 02:02:58,121
with your trust.

1187
02:02:58,955 --> 02:03:02,084
Now I honor you
with my faith.

1188
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:07,009
Follow me and
you will be free!

1189
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:10,099
Stay and you will perish.

1190
02:03:12,635 --> 02:03:14,353
Do not be afraid!

1191
02:03:15,847 --> 02:03:17,440
God is with us!

1192
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:19,818
Go! Ready yourselves!

1193
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:21,603
Go!

1194
02:03:21,769 --> 02:03:23,396
God is with us!

1195
02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:27,613
Pass the word!
We <i>cross</i> here!

1196
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:30,237
As quickly as you can,
gather your things.

1197
02:03:30,862 --> 02:03:32,239
And form in groups!

1198
02:03:36,326 --> 02:03:37,828
Quickly!

1199
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:47,508
Come on!

1200
02:04:36,511 --> 02:04:37,512
steady!

1201
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:45,691
To the right,
to the right! Tight!

1202
02:05:11,838 --> 02:05:13,806
Keep moving!

1203
02:05:14,799 --> 02:05:16,893
There's nothing to fear!

1204
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:21,932
Don't worry!
You'll be safe!

1205
02:05:44,662 --> 02:05:47,085
Keep to the right!
Keep to the right!

1206
02:05:51,961 --> 02:05:53,429
Ramses!

1207
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:22,621
Ohh!

1208
02:06:27,246 --> 02:06:28,247
Stop!

1209
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:54,114
Stop! Stop!

1210
02:06:54,398 --> 02:06:55,650
Whoa!

1211
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:14,093
<i>Go,</i>

1212
02:07:16,587 --> 02:07:17,713
Keep moving!

1213
02:07:18,381 --> 02:07:20,679
Keep moving! Forward!

1214
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:51,080
There,

1215
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:14,187
Joshua!

1216
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,196
Aaron!

1217
02:08:31,287 --> 02:08:32,755
Run!

1218
02:08:32,914 --> 02:08:34,211
Everyone, run!

1219
02:08:34,582 --> 02:08:35,708
Move!

1220
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:37,377
Run to shore!

1221
02:09:24,674 --> 02:09:25,675
Moshe,

1222
02:10:28,237 --> 02:10:29,409
Moshe,

1223
02:10:33,659 --> 02:10:34,660
We must leave!

1224
02:10:38,998 --> 02:10:40,045
Ramses!

1225
02:10:40,416 --> 02:10:42,089
Ramses!

1226
02:10:45,129 --> 02:10:46,756
Whoa!

1227
02:10:47,381 --> 02:10:48,428
Go!

1228
02:10:48,674 --> 02:10:50,096
Ramses, stop!

1229
02:10:57,808 --> 02:11:00,982
All! Turn around!

1230
02:11:01,145 --> 02:11:03,773
Turn around!

1231
02:11:03,939 --> 02:11:05,862
Khyan!

1232
02:11:12,656 --> 02:11:14,078
Leave,

1233
02:11:14,241 --> 02:11:15,242
Brother...

1234
02:11:15,409 --> 02:11:17,332
Leave now! That's an order!

1235
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:45,486
Come! You'll never
make it back!

1236
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:05,550
Go!

1237
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:13,892
Faster!

1238
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:35,777
It's just me here

1239
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:45,832
Sit.

1240
02:14:52,084 --> 02:14:54,587
My family,

1241
02:14:54,753 --> 02:14:56,175
is not far from here

1242
02:14:56,255 --> 02:14:57,256
Your family?

1243
02:14:57,339 --> 02:14:59,842
My other family.
My wife, my son,

1244
02:15:01,343 --> 02:15:03,141
I was thinking...

1245
02:15:03,304 --> 02:15:05,773
maybe I could convince them...

1246
02:15:06,515 --> 02:15:09,189
Convince them to join us
but perhaps that's...

1247
02:15:10,728 --> 02:15:11,820
Perhaps that's not wise.

1248
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:13,902
Of course they should come.

1249
02:15:14,064 --> 02:15:15,532
We have a long way to go,

1250
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:17,614
A lot can happen.

1251
02:15:18,110 --> 02:15:19,612
And then...

1252
02:15:20,195 --> 02:15:22,323
we get there,
if we get there,

1253
02:15:22,489 --> 02:15:24,366
You don't think they'll
let us settle in Canaan?

1254
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:27,378
They'll see us as invaders,

1255
02:15:27,911 --> 02:15:31,290
They won't have a choice.
We're as big as any tribe.

1256
02:15:31,457 --> 02:15:32,674
We're as big <i>as
a</i> nation of tribes

1257
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:33,922
and that concerns me
even more.

1258
02:15:34,418 --> 02:15:35,761
Why?

1259
02:15:36,962 --> 02:15:39,306
This many people?

1260
02:15:39,465 --> 02:15:41,513
You have to ask?

1261
02:15:44,136 --> 02:15:45,809
But we all have
the same goal,

1262
02:15:45,971 --> 02:15:47,018
We do now,

1263
02:15:48,265 --> 02:15:50,518
What happens when
we stop running?

1264
02:16:15,209 --> 02:16:16,631
Ramses...

1265
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:20,218
the Great,

1266
02:16:29,598 --> 02:16:31,396
Thank you,

1267
02:16:57,042 --> 02:16:58,214
Gershom,

1268
02:17:49,678 --> 02:17:51,931
Did you do what you said?

1269
02:17:52,931 --> 02:17:55,025
What did I say?

1270
02:17:56,226 --> 02:17:59,025
That you would
trade your faith,

1271
02:18:00,564 --> 02:18:02,032
to keep me,

1272
02:18:03,025 --> 02:18:04,527
<i>No,</i>

1273
02:18:07,112 --> 02:18:09,080
Good,

1274
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:12,288
You may need it
more than ever now,

1275
02:18:24,922 --> 02:18:27,220
Who are they?

1276
02:18:28,550 --> 02:18:31,053
They're my people

1277
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:40,904
Who makes you happy?

1278
02:18:43,232 --> 02:18:44,324
You do.

1279
02:18:45,442 --> 02:18:48,662
What is the most important
thing in your life?

1280
02:18:50,322 --> 02:18:51,414
You are,

1281
02:18:51,949 --> 02:18:53,622
You are,

1282
02:18:57,621 --> 02:18:59,419
When will I leave you?

1283
02:19:02,501 --> 02:19:03,753
Never,

1284
02:19:08,257 --> 02:19:10,009
May I proceed?

1285
02:19:12,594 --> 02:19:14,688
Proceed.

1286
02:20:38,513 --> 02:20:40,106
What do you think
of this?

1287
02:20:41,683 --> 02:20:43,526
I wouldn't do it...

1288
02:20:43,685 --> 02:20:45,278
if I didn't agree,

1289
02:20:47,189 --> 02:20:48,941
That's true,

1290
02:20:49,608 --> 02:20:51,576
I've noticed that
about you.

1291
02:20:52,527 --> 02:20:54,950
You don't always
agree with me,

1292
02:20:55,739 --> 02:20:59,039
Nor you me, I've noticed

1293
02:20:59,534 --> 02:21:02,959
Yet here we are,
still speaking.

1294
02:21:03,246 --> 02:21:05,374
But not for much longer.

1295
02:21:09,211 --> 02:21:10,963
A leader can falter...

1296
02:21:11,129 --> 02:21:12,551
but stone...

1297
02:21:13,423 --> 02:21:15,425
will endure,

1298
02:21:16,051 --> 02:21:18,224
These laws will guide
them in your stead,

1299
02:21:21,098 --> 02:21:22,645
If you disagree...

1300
02:21:23,225 --> 02:21:25,603
you should put
down the hammer.
