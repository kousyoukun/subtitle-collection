Timokhin - P. SAVIN

35
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:07,223
On June 12, the armies of Western Europe
crossed the Russian frontier,

36
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,768
and the war began.

37
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:18,109
That is, an event took place
that was counter to human reason

38
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:22,280
and human nature.

39
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,587
Papa, I teII you positiveIy.

40
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,964
And, Mother, you too. I have decided.

41
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,763
You must Iet me join the army. That's it.

42
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,891
WeII, here's a fine warrior.

43
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,893
Nonsense. You must study.

44
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,686
It's not nonsense.

45
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,523
OboIensky's younger than I am,
and he's going.

46
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,568
Besides, I can't study now when -

47
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,987
When -

48
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,490
When the country's in danger.

49
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,326
Petya, be quiet, I teII you.

50
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,787
I'm serious. Ask Pyotr KiriIych.

51
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:15,124
Nonsense. The mother's miIk
hasn't dried on your Iips yet.

52
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,628
WeII! WeII! I'm teIIing you -

53
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,012
O Lord our God,

54
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:33,142
take up the Iance and shieId
and rise up to heIp us.

55
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:38,523
Put to shame
and confound those who wish us harm.

56
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,110
And may your powerfuI angeIs
drive them away.

57
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:46,739
Smite our enemies and put them to flight.

58
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:13,266
Our father! The czar!

59
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,976
The czar!

60
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:31,743
Hurrah! Hurrah!

61
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:37,624
Which one's the czar?

62
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:59,187
Kutuzov has done nothing
but cause the emperor troubIe.

63
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,734
How couId they make this man
commander in chief?

64
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,987
He's incapabIe of mounting a horse,

65
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,531
he faIIs asIeep at counciI meetings,

66
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,327
and he has the worst temper.

67
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:19,415
That's not even to mention
his quaIities as a generaI.

68
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,584
At a moment Iike this,

69
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,837
how can you appoint
a decrepit, bIind oId man?

70
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,798
He's absoIuteIy bIind.

71
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,008
A spIendid generaI - a bIind man.

72
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,928
He can't see a thing.

73
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,932
PIaying bIind man's bIuff.

74
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,727
"Our troops fight
as they never have before.

75
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:43,606
The fate of the army and the country
is in the hands of a good minister

76
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,775
but a bad generaI.

77
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,654
BarcIay deIays action.
The whoIe army curses him.

78
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,865
The French are in Vitebsk!

79
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,829
In four days, they might reach SmoIensk.

80
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,664
Perhaps they are there aIready."

81
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,885
What do you think about it, Prince?

82
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,388
Me? Me?

83
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:24,897
It's possibIe the theater of war

84
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,401
may move so near to us that -

85
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,404
The "theater of war"!

86
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,991
I have said and stiII say
the theater of war is PoIand.

87
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,327
The enemy wiII never get beyond the Neman.

88
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:44,709
When the snow meIts,
they'II sink in the PoIish swamps.

89
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:51,257
But, Prince,
the Ietter mentions they're in Vitebsk.

90
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,803
The Ietter.

91
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,181
Yes, yes, yes.

92
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,270
He writes the French were beaten?

93
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,855
Near which river?

94
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,613
The prince says nothing about it.

95
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,994
WeII, MikhaiI Ivanovich, come.

96
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,080
ExpIain to me how you mean
to change those pIans.

97
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,118
Take it! Take it aII!

98
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:06,833
I'II set it on fire myseIf!

99
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,503
Those deviIs won't get it!

100
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,759
Every place seemed unsatisfactory to him.

101
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:05,933
But the worst of all
was his old divan in the study.

102
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:13,816
He dreaded it because of the sad thoughts

103
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,069
that kept turning over in his mind
when he lay there.

104
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,764
Not Iike that!

105
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,304
No peace.

106
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,849
Curse you.

107
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:16,772
There was something important
l was saving for bedtime.

108
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,191
The bolts? No, l told him about them.

109
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,862
lt was something -
something in the drawing room.

110
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,073
Tishka!

111
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,159
What did he taIk about at dinner?

112
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,203
-About Prince MikhaiI.
-Quiet!

113
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,913
Yes, I know.

114
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,041
The Ietter from Prince Andrei.

115
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,222
The French are in Vitebsk.

116
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,977
ln four days, they might reach Smolensk.

117
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,896
Perhaps they are there already.

118
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,360
Tishka!

119
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,116
No. It's nothing.

120
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,633
It's nothing.

121
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,039
My heart is heavy.

122
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,000
The princess is afraid.

123
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,048
My heart is heavy.

124
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,134
Your heart?

125
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,595
His heart. His heart is heavy.

126
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:31,073
AII my thoughts... were about you.

127
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:50,092
I was caIIing for you aII night.

128
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,432
If onIy I had known. I was afraid to come.

129
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,353
-You weren't asIeep?
-No.

130
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,859
My dear.

131
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,656
Why didn't you come?

132
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,911
Thank you,

133
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,873
my beIoved daughter,

134
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,126
for everything.

135
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,504
Forgive -

136
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,466
Thank you.

137
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,302
Forgive me.

138
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,096
Thank you.

139
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,520
Send for Andrei.

140
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,651
I have a Ietter from him.

141
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,904
Where is he?

142
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,366
With the army at SmoIensk.

143
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:17,304
Yes. Russia is Iost.

144
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,600
They've ruined her.

145
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:29,538
I want to try to sing.
It's something to do.

146
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,207
-That's fine.
-I'm so happy.

147
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:36,128
Did you know NikoIai has received
the Cross of St. George?

148
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,547
I know. I sent him the announcement.

149
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,842
WeII, I don't want to interrupt you.

150
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,887
Is it wrong of me to sing?

151
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,515
No. Why shouId it be?
On the contrary.

152
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,312
But why do you ask me?

153
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,730
I don't know myseIf.

154
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,150
I shouId not Iike to do anything
that might dispIease you.

155
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,779
I trust you compIeteIy.
You mean so much to me.

156
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,115
You have done so much for me.

157
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:11,747
I saw in the same announcement -
BoIkonsky is in the army again.

158
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,875
What do you think?
WiII he ever forgive me?

159
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:19,755
WiII he aIways feeI bitter towards me?
What do you think?

160
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,465
What do you think?

161
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,176
I think...

162
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,389
he has nothing to forgive you for.

163
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:39,107
If I were in his pIace -
-You?

164
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,443
That's a different thing entireIy.

165
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:45,822
It's not possibIe for there to be anyone
kinder and more generous than you.

166
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,618
If it weren't for you,

167
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,913
I don't know what wouId have become of me.

168
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,543
Because I -

169
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,722
I forgot. I must be getting home.

170
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,433
Why must you go? Why?

171
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,979
Because - It's just that I have business.

172
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,480
But why?

173
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,232
Why can't...

174
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,611
you teII me?

175
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,539
Have you heard the great news?

176
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,542
Kutuzov has been made fieId marshaI.

177
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:24,504
That's the end of the controversy.
I am deIighted.

178
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm so happy.
At Iast, there's a man for you.

179
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,177
But they say he's bIind?

180
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:34,389
Nonsense. He sees aII he needs to see.

181
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,560
Kutuzov is a cIever man.
I've known him a Iong time.

182
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,313
He's coming! There he is!

183
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:25,691
With men Iike these,
why do we keep retreating?

184
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:48,797
Good day, Prince. My dear boy.

185
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,382
Come aIong.

186
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,358
I sent for you because I need you near me.

187
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,949
Thank you, Your ExceIIency, but I'm afraid
I can't work on the generaI staff.

188
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,495
I'm used to my regiment,
and I've grown fond of the officers.

189
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,664
And I imagine they've grown fond of me.

190
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,666
I wouId hate to Ieave the regiment.

191
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:29,421
If I decIine the honor of being with you,
beIieve me -

192
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:34,092
I regret it.
You wouId have been usefuI to me.

193
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,052
But you're right.

194
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,264
Our best men don't beIong here.

195
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,977
Our regiments wouId be different

196
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:50,025
if aII the advisers served in them,

197
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,444
Iike you.

198
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,739
I remember you from AusterIitz.

199
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,159
I remember.

200
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,788
I remember you with the standard.

201
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:20,347
Advisers, advisers.

202
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,063
There are aIways pIenty of advisers.

203
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,441
But not enough reaI men.

204
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,696
Everything moves too fast.

205
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,700
Nothing is accompIished in haste.

206
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:44,162
It is easy to take a fortress

207
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,542
but hard to win a campaign.

208
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,298
That requires patience and time.

209
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,260
Kamensky used his soIdiers
to take Rushchuk.

210
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,220
I used patience and time.

211
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:07,811
And I took more fortresses... than he did.

212
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,190
I made the Turks eat horsemeat.

213
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,193
Give me time,

214
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,030
and the French shaII eat it too.

215
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,199
Take my word for it.

216
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,036
I'II make them eat horsemeat!

217
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,459
But won't we have to engage in a battIe?

218
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:35,881
We must... if everybody insists on it.

219
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,758
There's nothing to be done.

220
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,140
WeII, good-bye, dear feIIow.

221
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,894
Go with God on your path.

222
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,981
I know that your path is an honorabIe one.

223
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:59,154
Remember I share your grief
over the Ioss of your father.

224
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:05,619
And for you, I am not His ExceIIency,
not a prince, not a commander in chief

225
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,704
but a second father.

226
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:30,036
The maidens went to the river to bathe

227
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:34,624
Bumblebee, bumblebee
Wonder, wonder, wonder-bee

228
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:38,461
That was Lusha, my honeybee...

229
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,149
WeII, my countryman,
are we to put down here?

230
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,526
-Or do we go to Moscow?
-Dandies.

231
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,447
It's not onIy soIdiers.
Even peasants are fighting now.

232
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:09,200
They're enIisting peasants too now.
They can't pick and choose.

233
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,786
The whoIe nation is fighting.

234
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:15,331
One word - Moscow.

235
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,917
There's onIy one thing waiting for us.

236
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,728
Count? Your ExceIIency.
What are you doing here?

237
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,147
I wanted to see what was going on.

238
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,066
There wiII certainIy be something to see.

239
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,902
How dreadfuI.

240
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,737
These are from yesterday.

241
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,241
From the Shevardino Redoubt.

242
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:54,120
There were heavy Iosses.
We surrendered the hiII.

243
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:59,375
I want to join
and take part in the fighting.

244
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,462
But I wanted to ask you,
where are our positions?

245
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,590
Our positions? That is not my speciaIity.

246
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:10,220
Go to Tatarinovo. They're digging there.
You can see everything from the hiIItop.

247
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:13,181
I wiII see everything? CouIdn't you -

248
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:17,560
I wish I couId show you the way,
but I must report to the corps commander.

249
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,440
This is how it is.
There wiII be a battIe tomorrow.

250
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:27,028
We expect not Iess than 20,000 wounded
for every 1 00,000 men.

251
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,197
We have no stretchers,
no medicaI attendants,

252
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,449
not even medicine for 6,000.

253
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:36,955
There are 1 0,000 carts,
but we need more than that.

254
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,715
-Look at that get-up.
-What's it for?

255
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,303
It's to scare the French.

256
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,021
Just Iike a doctor.

257
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:26,462
Pierre's consciousness
of the need for sacrifice,

258
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,257
of the suffering and misfortune
everyone shared,

259
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,761
drew him inexorably
to the site of the upcoming battle.

260
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:41,144
AIIow me to ask you,
what is that viIIage caIIed?

261
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,063
-Burdino or something.
-Borodino.

262
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:45,440
Are those our men?

263
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,901
Yes. And further on, the French.

264
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,777
There, you can see them.

265
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,822
-Where?
-There, in fuII view.

266
00:33:56,619 --> 00:34:00,496
-And over there?
-Those are our men.

267
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,749
Our men.

268
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,584
And there?

269
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,169
The French again.

270
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,758
Yesterday, we heId it.
Today, it's theirs.

271
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,386
Who might you be, a doctor?

272
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,890
No. I'm just...

273
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,726
-They're bringing it.
-They're bringing the HoIy Mother.

274
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,811
Our intercessor.

275
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,897
The HoIy Mother of SmoIensk!

276
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:50,922
Blessed Holy Mother of God

277
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:55,551
Save us

278
00:34:55,636 --> 00:35:01,516
Blessed Holy Mother of God

279
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,604
Save us

280
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:16,030
Glory be to the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost

281
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:20,952
Now and ever

282
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,664
And forever more

283
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,834
Amen

284
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:36,634
O Mother of God
Save thy servants from calamity

285
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:46,060
For to thee we all cling

286
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:57,864
You are our invincible shield
and protectress

287
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:09,459
Look with favor upon us
O Merciful Mother of God

288
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:19,761
Forgive my sinful thoughts
and words and deeds

289
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:31,564
And soothe my agony, for l suffer

290
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,367
He knew that tomorrow's battle

291
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:11,622
was to be the worst
he had ever taken part in.

292
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,959
And the possibility of death

293
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:21,007
vividly, clearly presented itself to him.

294
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:38,941
My country. The fall of Moscow.

295
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,487
Tomorrow, l shall be killed.

296
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:47,200
Then why this trial
when tomorrow l shall cease to exist?

297
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,703
l won't exist,

298
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,039
so who is this trial for?

299
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,337
New conditions of life will begin
about which l will know nothing.

300
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,005
l will cease to be.

301
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:12,850
l will no longer exist.

302
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,127
Your ExceIIency.

303
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:46,300
The Ieft flank of Second BattaIion has moved
toward the viIIage of Semyonovskaya.

304
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,219
Sentries have been posted
in each squadron.

305
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,223
Who's there?

306
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:56,811
What brings you here?
This is unexpected.

307
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,565
I just came, you know -

308
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,483
It's interesting.

309
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,277
I wanted to see the battIe.

310
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,321
What's the news in Moscow?
Has my famiIy moved to Moscow?

311
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:10,825
Yes. JuIie Drubetskaya toId me so.

312
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,661
I paid them a visit,
but I didn't find them in.

313
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,038
They are at your estate near Moscow.

314
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:28,259
I've viewed the positions of our troops.

315
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:33,848
I am not a miIitary man, so I can't say
I reaIIy understand things.

316
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,560
But I think I understand
the generaI disposition.

317
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:42,023
It seems that our positions -

318
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,318
It seems to me the Ieft flank is weak

319
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,153
and our right flank is too drawn out.

320
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,739
So you've made sense
of the disposition of our forces?

321
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,657
Yes. What do you mean?

322
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:57,204
Success does not depend
on positions or weapons

323
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,249
nor even the number of men.

324
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:01,167
Then on what?

325
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,337
It depends on the feeIing within me,
within him,

326
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,088
within every soIdier.

327
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,635
Why did we Iose at AusterIitz?

328
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,095
Positions?

329
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,224
Nonsense. That's not the point.

330
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,895
We had no right to be there. We were
in a hurry to Ieave the battIefieId.

331
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,148
What wiII happen to us tomorrow?

332
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,069
To me, tomorrow wiII be simpIe.

333
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,239
1 00,000 Russian soIdiers

334
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:35,451
and 1 00,000 French soIdiers
wiII meet in combat.

335
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:39,080
Those 200,000 are going to fight.

336
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,709
The side that is fiercest
and spares itseIf Ieast

337
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:45,419
is the side that wiII win.

338
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:52,843
Tomorrow, whatever the circumstances,
we are certain to win.

339
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:59,600
True, very true, Your ExceIIency.

340
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,519
We'II not spare ourseIves.

341
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,231
The men in my battaIion
wouIdn't touch their vodka.

342
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,316
"This is not the day for that," they said.

343
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,623
The war must spread into the country.

344
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,876
I cannot sufficientIy advocate this pIan.

345
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:29,839
Oh, yes.
Our onIy object is to weaken the enemy,

346
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:34,385
so, of course, we cannot consider
the Ioss to private individuaIs.

347
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,849
"Spread into the country."

348
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:46,147
In the country is where my father,
my son, my sister are - at BaId HiIIs.

349
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,857
It's aII the same to him.

350
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,112
They surrendered aII of Europe to NapoIeon
and now come here to teach us.

351
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,574
Fine teachers.

352
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,619
So you think
we wiII win tomorrow's battIe?

353
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:05,916
Yes, but if I had it in my power,
I wouId do one thing.

354
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,086
I wouId take no prisoners.

355
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:13,007
The French destroyed my home
and mean to destroy Moscow.

356
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,010
They have insuIted me
and continue to insuIt me every second.

357
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,430
They are my enemies.
They are criminaIs.

358
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,766
Timokhin thinks as I do.
The whoIe army too.

359
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,561
We must punish them.
They pIunder and kiII our chiIdren.

360
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,189
How can we taIk about ruIes of war
and mercy?

361
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:32,443
We must take no prisoners,
but kiII and be prepared to die.

362
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:38,157
War is not about decency.
It is the Iowest thing men stoop to.

363
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,995
One must reaIize this
and not make a game out of war.

364
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,332
War is a dreadfuI necessity.

365
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:51,545
Cast off the Iies and see war as war.
It is no game.

366
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:58,928
Men come together, Iike they wiII tomorrow,
to murder one another.

367
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:03,891
They wiII kiII each other,
maim thousands upon thousands

368
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,520
and then hoId sacred services
and offer up their prayers

369
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:10,064
for having kiIIed so many human beings.

370
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:14,568
And they'II exaggerate it in the reteIIing
and embeIIish the victory.

371
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:19,114
The side that kiIIs the most peopIe
wins the most honors.

372
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,952
Whoever succeeds in kiIIing
the most peopIe gets the greatest rewards.

373
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:26,330
How can God bear to witness such things?

374
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,002
Ah, my dear friend.

375
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,551
Life has become...

376
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,556
unbearabIe of Iate.

377
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,853
But it won't be for Iong.

378
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:53,357
We must both get some sIeep. Go now.

379
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,942
-But no.
-Go, go.

380
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,027
Before a battIe, you need to sIeep.

381
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,041
Good-bye. Go!

382
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,378
Whether we see each other again or not -

383
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:31,896
l know that this is our last meeting.

384
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:46,136
Be off with you, dear boy,
and God be with you.

385
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,874
BattaIion, forward!

386
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,247
-Bring the ammunition boxes.
-The cannon baII.

387
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:46,840
Sir, pIease make way.
Anything can happen.

388
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,640
Aren't you afraid, sir?

389
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,892
-Are you afraid?
-Of course I am.

390
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:00,687
There's no mercy out here.
Turn around and your guts get bIown out.

391
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:06,318
It's a soIdier's work,
but it's odd to see a gentIeman here.

392
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,112
To your posts!

393
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,780
Forward march!

394
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,909
Load quickIy!

395
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,661
Fire!

396
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,509
Bravo! Bravo!

397
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:36,051
Ready! Aim! Fire!

398
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:47,562
In rows! Division, march!

399
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,371
What about the Russians?

400
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,790
Standing firm, Your Excellency.

401
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:12,296
So they want more?
Give them more.

402
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,798
A Iive one!

403
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:19,553
Not there!

404
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:20,971
The infantry!

405
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,812
What? A friend of yours?

406
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,693
More to the right!

407
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,573
One, two! Once more!

408
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,742
Numbers four and five!

409
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:45,871
Charge the guns with grape shot!
Load! QuickIy!

410
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,712
Our gentIeman
nearIy had his hat knocked off.

411
00:52:57,467 --> 00:52:59,509
That was a nasty one.

412
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:04,639
Hey, foxes, don't you Iike our porridge?

413
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,641
What's this?

414
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:07,893
A IittIe shorter.

415
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,916
Sire, the Russians wiII be routed
if you give me another division.

416
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,417
You are very fiery, BeIIiard.

417
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:35,087
In the heat of battIe,
it is easy to make a mistake.

418
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:38,465
Have another Iook and return to me.

419
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:53,814
-Sire, the prince wouId Iike -
-Some reinforcements?

420
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,152
We must send in reinforcements.

421
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:01,321
Who do you think shouId be sent?

422
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:04,366
Sire, send CIaparède's division.

423
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,538
No, I can't send CIaparède.

424
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,623
Send Friant's division.

425
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,522
May l venture to suggest lunch
to Your Majesty?

426
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:40,193
l hope l may congratulate
Your Majesty on a victory.

427
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,695
Go away!

428
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,208
Number ten! Forward!

429
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:26,406
Permission to speak, sir?

430
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:29,701
It is my duty to report
there are onIy eight rounds Ieft.

431
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,661
Are we to continue firing?

432
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,413
Grape shot!

433
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,328
Forward!

434
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,227
Your ExceIIency,
we've recaptured our positions.

435
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,729
Prince Bagration has been wounded.

436
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:50,574
Hurry to Prince Pyotr Ivanovich
and find out exactIy how things are.

437
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:55,370
Your ExceIIency.

438
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,905
Prince Andrei's regiment
was held in reserve.

439
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:36,119
Without moving from the spot
or firing a single shot,

440
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:39,623
the regiment lost almost
one third of its men.

441
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,379
TeII the men they may sit.

442
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,180
First BattaIion, at ease!

443
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:30,965
Left! Left! Left!

444
00:58:57,702 --> 00:58:59,577
Sir, there are no more cartridges.

445
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:02,122
Robbers! What have they done?

446
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,666
Run to the depot.
Bring the ammunition boxes.

447
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:07,252
I'II go.

448
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,099
Adjutant,
order them not to crowd together!

449
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:58,613
Look out!

450
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,657
CoIoneI BoIkon -

451
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:03,409
Lie down!

452
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:07,330
Can this be death?

453
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,543
l can't. l don't want to die.

454
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:28,184
l love life!

455
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:31,855
l love this grass, this earth, this air!

456
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:22,966
Brothers!

457
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:56,309
Stand fast!

458
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:08,404
Forward! Disperse!

459
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,909
Batteries, fire!

460
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,259
Every point in our position
is in enemy hands.

461
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,013
We haven't the troops to drive them back.

462
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,891
The men are in a rout.
There's no stopping them.

463
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:53,647
I have not considered it right
to conceaI from you what I saw.

464
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:55,858
The troops are in compIete disorder.

465
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:00,863
How - How dare you!

466
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:08,829
How dare you say that to me!

467
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:12,500
You don't know anything!

468
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:17,505
The enemy's been repuIsed on the Ieft
and defeated on the right flanks!

469
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:23,010
You have seen badIy, sir.

470
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,431
Do not taIk about what you do not know.

471
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,729
Ride to GeneraI BarcIay

472
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:38,901
and inform him that I intend
to attack the enemy tomorrow.

473
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,786
The enemy is defeated!

474
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:57,711
Tomorrow, we'II begin driving him
out of our hoIy Russia.

475
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:12,852
Rayevsky! Here is my hero.

476
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:16,856
ExceIIency, the troops
are firmIy hoIding their ground.

477
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,817
The French cannot maintain their attack.

478
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:27,783
Kaisarov!
Write out the order for tomorrow.

479
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:33,289
You, ride down the Iine
and say that tomorrow we attack.

480
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:04,487
That very evening and the next day,

481
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:09,992
reports were coming in
of unheard-of losses,

482
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,329
of the loss of half the army.

483
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:20,169
Another battle was physically impossible.

484
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:43,484
Go to sleep

485
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:48,906
Little Andrei

486
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:54,995
Slumber now

487
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:01,293
Lullaby, lullaby

488
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:05,714
Lullaby

489
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:16,392
Lullaby, my baby, lullaby

490
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:27,695
The little doves have flown to you

491
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:37,788
Perching on your little cradle

492
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:42,835
Lullaby, lullaby

493
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:47,881
Lullaby

494
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:57,600
Lullaby, my baby, lullaby

495
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,172
My God. What is it?

496
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:31,800
Why is he here?

497
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:47,436
Not forjust that day and that hour

498
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:52,649
were this man's mind and conscience
darkened.

499
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,818
On him the responsibility
of what was happening

500
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:59,490
lay more heavily
than on all the others involved.

501
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:04,703
Never, even until the end of his life,

502
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:07,456
could he understand goodness,

503
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:12,711
nor beauty nor truth

504
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:14,922
nor the significance of his actions

505
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:19,885
which were too contrary
to goodness and truth,

506
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,471
too remote from everything human,

507
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,808
for him to be able to grasp their meaning.

508
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:31,730
He could not disavow his actions,

509
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:35,651
lauded as they were by half the world,

510
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:42,074
and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness

511
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,451
and all things human.

512
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:03,846
Enough. Enough, mankind.

513
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,932
Stop. Come to your senses.

514
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,934
What are you doing?

515
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:16,984
Exhausted by want of food and rest,

516
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:21,738
the men on both sides
began equally to doubt

517
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:27,077
whether they should continue
to slaughter one another.

518
01:18:28,246 --> 01:18:30,455
You may kill whoever you please,

519
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:34,459
do whatever you want,
but l don't want to be part of this.

520
01:18:34,544 --> 01:18:41,508
Yet some incomprehensible,
mysterious force

521
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:44,845
continued to control them,

522
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:49,349
and the terrible work continued

523
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:53,562
independent of the will of men.

524
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:47,032
lt was a moral victory,

525
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:53,413
one that convinced the enemy
of his opponent's moral superiority

526
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,457
and of his own impotence.

527
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:59,378
Such was the Russian outcome at Borodino.

528
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:29,866
A direct consequence
of the Battle of Borodino

529
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:33,495
was Napoleon's senseless flight
away from Moscow,

530
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:39,626
the ruin of the invading army of 500,000

531
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:43,880
and the downfall of Napoleonic France

532
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:47,759
where, for the first time at Borodino,

533
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:54,516
the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit
had been laid.

534
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:29,301
