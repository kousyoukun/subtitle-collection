1
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,140
I believe in America.

2
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,180
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,400
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,320
I gave her freedom, but I taught
her never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,900
She found a boyfriend,
not an Italian.

6
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,410
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,200
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,000
Two months ago he took her for a
drive with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,670
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,130
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,350
She resisted, she
kept her honor.

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,680
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,480
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,030
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,660
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,210
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,210
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,880
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,510
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

20
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,440
Sorry.

21
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,410
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,160
These two boys were
brought to trial.

23
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,040
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,250
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Suspended the sentence! They
went free that very day!

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,010
I stood in the
courtroom like a fool.

27
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,600
Those two bastards,
they smiled at me.

28
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,440
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,240
Why did you go to the police? Why
didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,460
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,210
What is that?

32
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,180
I want them dead.

33
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,610
That I cannot do.

34
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,450
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,370
I've known you many years, but this is
the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,590
I can't remember the last time you
invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,510
Even though my wife is
godmother to your only child.

38
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,600
But let's be Frank here. You
never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,430
And you were afraid
to be in my debt.

40
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,930
I didn't want to
get into trouble.

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,690
I understand.

42
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,070
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,030
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,830
You didn't need a
friend like me.

45
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,040
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,540
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,300
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,090
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,690
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,310
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,900
Let them suffer, then,
as she suffers.

53
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,330
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,930
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,100
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,770
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,270
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,570
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,330
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,960
Be my friend?

61
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,460
Godfather?

62
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,010
Good.

63
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,310
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,810
But until that day

65
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,900
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,400
- Gràzie, Godfather.
- Prego.

67
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,160
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,920
I want people that aren't
going to get carried away.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,170
We're not murderers, in spite
of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,870
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,080
We're not taking the
picture without Michael.

72
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,880
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,230
Don Barzini.

74
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,910
Hey, Paulie! Let
me have some wine.

75
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,250
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,300
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,630
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,640
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,190
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,590
20, 30 grand. In
small bills, cash.

81
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,920
In that little silk purse.

82
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,590
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

83
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,930
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,810
I got two gabagool,
capocol, and a prosciut.

85
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,980
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,030
What's the matter?

87
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,880
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,210
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,060
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,110
Get out of here! It's a
private party. Go on!

91
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,150
What is it? It's my
sister's wedding.

92
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,450
Goddamn FBI don't
respect nothing!

93
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,840
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,650
But towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,820
so for six months he's
worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,650
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,700
Now that the war is over,

98
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,780
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,750
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,460
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,920
You understand everything.

102
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,130
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,230
Wait till you see the wedding
cake I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,060
The bride, the groom
and the angel...

105
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,860
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,515
Give it to a Jew Congressman
in another district.

107
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:23,080
Who else is on the list?

108
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,710
Hey, Michael!

109
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,980
He's not on the list, but
Luca Brasi wants to see you.

110
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,200
Is this necessary?

111
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,910
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

112
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,670
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

113
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,590
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

114
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,090
May their first child
be a masculine child.

115
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,720
Michael...

116
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,890
That man over there is
talking to himself.

117
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,810
See that scary guy over there?

118
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,400
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

119
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,150
His name is Luca Brasi. He
helps my father out sometimes.

120
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,870
Michael, he's coming over here!

121
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,040
You look terrific!

122
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,420
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

123
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,420
Your father's been
asking for you.

124
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,340
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

125
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,800
Why does your brother
have a different name?

126
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,770
My brother Sonny found
Tom Hagen in the street.

127
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,770
He had no home, so my
father took him in.

128
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,610
He's been with us ever since.

129
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,650
He's a good lawyer.

130
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,070
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

131
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,080
- What's that?
- That's a,

132
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,950
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

133
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,120
You like your lasagna?

134
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,590
Don Corleone.

135
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,340
I'm honored and grateful

136
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,260
that you have invited me to
your daughter's wedding.

137
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,560
On the day of your
daughter's wedding.

138
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,480
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

139
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,030
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

140
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,420
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

141
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,630
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

142
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,510
Thank you.

143
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,350
Signora Corleone!

144
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,390
No!

145
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,590
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

146
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,930
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

147
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,190
What is that outside?

148
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,820
Johnny! Johnny!

149
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,540
I love you!

150
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,260
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

151
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,840
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

152
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,180
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

153
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,620
You never said you
knew Johnny Fontane!

154
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,790
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

155
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,710
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

156
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,880
How?

157
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,260
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

158
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,750
Please, Michael. Tell me.

159
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,300
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

160
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,260
with a big bandleader.

161
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,600
And as his career got better and
better, he wanted to get out of it.

162
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,350
Johnny is my father's godson.

163
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,770
My father went to see
this bandleader.

164
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,740
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,

165
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,570
but the bandleader said no.

166
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,040
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

167
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,040
Within an hour,

168
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,630
he signed a release for a
certified check of $ 1,000.

169
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,590
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

170
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,140
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

171
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,480
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

172
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,110
That's a true story.

173
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,210
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

174
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,470
Beautiful!

175
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,840
I'll take care of it.

176
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,800
Tom...

177
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,600
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

178
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,820
How are you, Fredo?

179
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,490
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

180
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,860
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

181
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,330
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

182
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah. This is your friend?

183
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,750
I don't know what to do. My
voice is weak. It's weak.

184
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,930
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

185
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,350
But this... man won't give it
to me, the head of the studio.

186
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,690
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

187
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,940
He won't give it to me, and
he says there's no chance.

188
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,490
Sonny?

189
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,280
Sonny?

190
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,960
Sonny?

191
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,540
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

192
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,500
The old man wants you.

193
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,460
One minute.

194
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,940
A month ago he bought the movie
rights to this book, a best-seller.

195
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,610
The main character is
a guy just like me.

196
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,370
I wouldn't even have to act.

197
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,160
Godfather, I don't
know what to do.

198
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,750
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

199
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,550
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

200
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,680
"What can I do? What can I
do?" What is that nonsense?

201
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,470
Ridiculous.

202
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,310
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

203
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,059
Good.

204
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,780
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

205
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,870
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

206
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:18,250
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

207
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,460
It's too late, they start
shooting in a week.

208
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,710
I'm going to make him an
offer he can't refuse.

209
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,550
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

210
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,770
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

211
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,130
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

212
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,840
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

213
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,270
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

214
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,140
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

215
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,690
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

216
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,190
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

217
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,620
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

218
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,080
If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

219
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,210
Carlo, we're going
to take the picture.

220
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,050
Wait a minute.

221
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,420
No, Michael. Not me.

222
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,810
Okay, that's it. Just like that.
Hold it!

223
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,130
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

224
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,630
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

225
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,470
This friend would give his
friendship to Mr. Woltz,

226
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,390
if Mr. Woltz would
grant us a favor.

227
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,810
Woltz is listening.

228
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,980
Give Johnny the part in that war
film you're starting next week.

229
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,700
And what favor would your
friend grant Mr. Woltz?

230
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,330
He could make your future
union problems disappear.

231
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,500
And one of your stars has just
moved from marijuana to heroin.

232
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,880
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

233
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,550
Let me lay it on the line.

234
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,630
Johnny Fontane will
never get that movie!

235
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,260
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

236
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,180
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

237
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,640
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

238
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,110
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

239
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,730
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

240
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,820
I'll wait for your call.

241
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,530
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

242
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,830
Check him out.

243
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,900
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

244
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,490
- It used to decorate a King's palace.
- Very nice.

245
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,950
Why didn't you say you
work for Corleone?

246
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,280
I thought you were some cheap
hustler Johnny was running in.

247
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,700
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

248
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,290
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

249
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,960
You do appreciate
beauty, don't you?

250
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,970
There you are. $600,000
on four hoofs.

251
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,010
I bet Russian czars never
paid that for a single horse.

252
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,640
Khartoum.

253
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,560
Khartoum.

254
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

255
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,610
Thanks, Tony.

256
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,320
Let's get something to eat.

257
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,820
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

258
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,330
To the Italian people that's a
very sacred, close relationship.

259
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,330
I respect it. Tell him
to ask me anything else.

260
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,750
This favor I can't give him.

261
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,130
He never asks a second favor when
he's been refused the first.

262
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:45,390
You don't understand. Johnny
Fontane never gets that movie.

263
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,140
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

264
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,350
I'm going to run him out of the
business, and let me tell you why.

265
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:00,030
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

266
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:05,490
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

267
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:10,200
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

268
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,080
Let me be even more Frank.

269
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,665
To show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man.

270
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,170
That it's not all
dollars and cents.

271
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,880
She was beautiful. She
was young and innocent!

272
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,390
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

273
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:33,600
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

274
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,390
And she runs off.

275
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,820
She threw it all away just
to make me look ridiculous!

276
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,070
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

277
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,490
You get the hell out of here!

278
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,950
If that goombah tries any rough
stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader.

279
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,250
Yeah, I heard that story.

280
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,090
Thank you for dinner and
a very pleasant evening.

281
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,050
Maybe your car can take
me to the airport.

282
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,720
Mr. Corleone insists on
hearing bad news immediately.

283
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,340
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

284
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,510
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

285
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,840
Now...

286
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,390
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

287
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,430
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife,

288
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,940
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

289
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,270
His business is narcotics.

290
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,730
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

291
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,650
In Sicily he has plants to
process them into heroin.

292
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,240
He needs cash, he needs
protection from the police.

293
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,250
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

294
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,580
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

295
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,460
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

296
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,300
He's known as a top
narcotics man.

297
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,060
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

298
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,770
Tom?

299
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,020
Yes. There's more money in
narcotics than anything else.

300
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:11,860
If we don't get into it, somebody
else will, maybe the five families.

301
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,410
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

302
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,580
Then they come after us.

303
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:25,210
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

304
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,420
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

305
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,050
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

306
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,560
Don Corleone.

307
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,940
I need a man who has
powerful friends.

308
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,780
I need a million
dollars in cash.

309
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:58,700
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

310
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,160
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

311
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,210
In the first year your end should
be three, four million dollars.

312
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,290
And then it would go up.

313
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,920
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

314
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,760
My compliments.

315
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,850
I'll take care of them,
out of my share.

316
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,230
So I receive 30% for finance,

317
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,650
political influence
and legal protection?

318
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,440
That's right.

319
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,660
Why do you come to me? Why do
I deserve this generosity?

320
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:46,040
If you consider a million
dollars in cash just finance,

321
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,290
te salud Don Corleone.

322
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,060
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

323
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,390
to be treated with respect.

324
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,360
But, I must say no to you.

325
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,360
And I'll give you my reason.

326
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,280
It's true, I have a lot
of friends in politics.

327
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,950
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

328
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,670
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

329
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,760
It doesn't make any difference to
me what a man does for a living.

330
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,090
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

331
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:47,600
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

332
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,190
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

333
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,280
I have a sentimental weakness for
my children, and I spoil them.

334
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,620
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

335
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,120
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish
to congratulate you on your new business.

336
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,670
I know you'll do
well, and good luck.

337
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:20,590
Especially since your interests don't
conflict with mine. Thank you.

338
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,150
Santino.

339
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,070
Come here.

340
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,330
What's the matter with you?

341
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,040
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

342
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,250
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

343
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,800
Go on.

344
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,600
Tom, what's this nonsense?

345
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,100
It's from Johnny. He's
starring in that new film.

346
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,020
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

347
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,860
And

348
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,070
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

349
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,620
I'm a little worried about
this Sollozzo fellow.

350
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,660
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

351
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,290
Go to the Tattaglias.

352
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,670
Make them think that you're
not too happy with our family

353
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,430
and find out what you can.

354
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,200
I got something for your
mother and for Sonny

355
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,950
and a tie for Freddy, and Tom
Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

356
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,290
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

357
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,110
Andiamo, Fredo.

358
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,620
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

359
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,710
I'll have to get it myself. Paulie
called in sick this morning.

360
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,710
Paulie's a good kid. I don't
mind getting the car.

361
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,300
Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.

362
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:55,220
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

363
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,150
You know who I am?

364
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,570
I know you.

365
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,450
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

366
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,450
I think you and I
can do business.

367
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,960
I need someone strong like you.

368
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,420
I heard you are not happy...

369
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,130
with the Corleone family.

370
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,630
Want to join me?

371
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,760
What's in it for me?

372
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,310
$50,000 to start with.

373
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,560
Not bad!

374
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,860
Agreed?

375
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,000
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

376
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:54,050
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

377
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:57,180
Make time, Consigliere.
Get in the car.

378
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,520
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

379
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,060
Get in.

380
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,780
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

381
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,420
Merry Christmas. I
want some fruit.

382
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,010
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Like in the story.

383
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,140
No.

384
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,600
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

385
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,150
Michael.

386
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,650
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

387
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,530
What's the matter?

388
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,090
They don't say if
he's dead or alive.

389
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,650
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

390
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,490
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

391
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,620
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

392
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,830
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

393
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,840
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

394
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,970
No. Look, come home, kid. You
should be with Mama, you hear?

395
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,020
Oh, my God.

396
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,440
Sonny!

397
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,620
Stay back there.

398
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,370
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

399
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,040
There's more news
about your old man.

400
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,300
Word is out that
he's already dead.

401
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:05,630
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

402
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,050
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

403
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,560
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

404
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,430
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

405
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,360
I don't care how sick he is. Bring
him to my father's house right now.

406
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,530
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

407
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,710
I'm going to have a couple of our
people come over to the house.

408
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,790
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

409
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,710
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

410
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,510
In three hours he'll be
released with our proposition.

411
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,930
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

412
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:56,640
What's done is done. Don't lose
that famous temper of yours, Sonny.

413
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,440
I'll wait.

414
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,790
Your boss is dead.

415
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,040
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

416
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,010
I want you to help the
Corleones and me.

417
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,470
We got him outside his office about
an hour after we picked you up.

418
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,180
Drink it.

419
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,400
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

420
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,410
Sonny was hot for
my deal, wasn't he?

421
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,620
And you knew it was the
right thing to do.

422
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:03,920
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

423
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:11,840
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

424
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:17,010
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

425
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:22,310
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don rest in peace was slipping.

426
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,320
Ten years ago, could I
have gotten to him?

427
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,160
Well, now he's dead, Tom, and
nothing can bring him back.

428
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:43,830
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

429
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,880
It's good business, Tom.

430
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:57,100
I'll try. But even Sonny won't
be able to call off Luca Brasi.

431
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,930
Yeah, well...

432
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,150
Let me worry about Luca.

433
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,740
You just talk to Sonny.

434
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,070
And the other two kids.

435
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,540
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

436
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,330
Now you can go.

437
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,850
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

438
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,390
Blood is a big expense.

439
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,500
He's still alive.

440
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,540
They hit him with five
shots, and he's still alive!

441
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:12,380
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

442
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,510
Your mother is at the
hospital with your father.

443
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:01,930
Looks like he'll pull through.

444
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,400
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

445
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,900
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

446
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,440
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

447
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,820
What about Luca? Sollozzo
thinks he can control him.

448
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,700
If Luca sold out, we're
in a lot of trouble.

449
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:28,370
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

450
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,500
- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

451
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:39,800
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

452
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:47,140
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

453
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:52,900
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

454
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,530
This is almost 1946. Nobody
wants bloodshed anymore.

455
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,280
If your father dies

456
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,450
you make the deal.

457
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:08,410
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

458
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,500
What is it?

459
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,300
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

460
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,510
Tessio, go see what it is.

461
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,100
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

462
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,940
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

463
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,610
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

464
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,320
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

465
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:47,120
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

466
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,790
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

467
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:55,170
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

468
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,960
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

469
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:05,220
Hanging around the house on the
phone would be a big help.

470
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,010
Try Luca again.

471
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,690
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

472
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,650
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

473
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,460
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

474
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,210
Probably late.

475
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,430
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:53,180
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

477
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,150
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

478
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:04,110
We have to find a spot on the West Side.
Try 309 West 43rd Street.

479
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:07,700
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

480
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,540
Think while you're driving. I
want to hit New York this month.

481
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,370
Watch the kids.

482
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:30,050
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

483
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,560
Yeah, all right.

484
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:36,060
Make sure they're clean, because the
guys will be there a long time.

485
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,400
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

486
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,440
Exterminate! Watch out, so
we don't exterminate you!

487
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,660
Pull over. I've got
to take a leak.

488
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,750
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

489
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,810
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

490
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,860
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

491
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,110
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

492
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,830
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

493
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:20,910
He's going to make it.

494
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,210
I love you.

495
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,250
I love you!

496
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,720
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

497
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,720
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

498
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,680
Can't you say it?

499
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,760
I'll see you tonight.

500
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,690
Why don't you tell that
nice girl you love her?

501
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:46,570
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

502
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:52,530
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

503
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:56,240
You start with a little
oil, then fry some garlic.

504
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:02,000
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

505
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,170
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

506
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,130
Add a little bit of wine.

507
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,800
And a little bit of sugar.
That's my trick.

508
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:22,180
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

509
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:24,480
You won't see him no more.

510
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,440
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

511
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,030
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

512
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,450
He'll be all right. Sollozzo
knows he's a civilian.

513
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,530
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

514
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,950
Send somebody with him anyway.

515
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,070
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

516
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:20,200
No, Kay. There will be detectives
there, people from the press.

517
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,410
I'll wait in the cab.

518
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,670
I don't want you
to get involved.

519
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,630
When will I see you again?

520
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:43,100
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

521
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:49,560
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

522
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,620
What are you doing here? You're
not supposed to be here.

523
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,200
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

524
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,620
What happened to the guards?

525
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:17,130
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

526
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,550
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

527
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:29,010
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

528
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,890
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

529
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:42,780
Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got
here late, there's nobody here.

530
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,160
No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody.
Papa's all alone.

531
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,740
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

532
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,080
I'm sorry, but you
will have to leave.

533
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,630
We're going to move
him to another room.

534
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,710
Can you disconnect the tubes?

535
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,340
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

536
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:10,720
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

537
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,600
Help me, please.

538
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,470
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the Baker.

539
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,560
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

540
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,770
You'd better go, there's
going to be trouble.

541
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:44,480
If there is trouble, I'll stay
here to help you. For your father.

542
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,610
Listen. Wait for me outside, in
front of the hospital, all right?

543
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,780
I'll be out in a minute.

544
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:10,300
Just lie here, Pop. I'll
take care of you now.

545
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,300
I'm with you now.

546
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,470
I'm with you.

547
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,090
Get rid of these. Come here.

548
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,265
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun.

549
01:06:58,266 --> 01:07:00,480
You'll be all right.

550
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,490
You did good.

551
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,250
I thought all you Guinea
hoods were locked up!

552
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:49,960
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

553
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,960
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

554
01:08:54,090 --> 01:09:00,010
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

555
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:04,140
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

556
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,060
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

557
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:16,490
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

558
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,450
Stand him up straight.

559
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:46,220
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

560
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,730
They're licensed
to carry firearms.

561
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,230
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show 'cause.

562
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:55,320
Let him go.

563
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,640
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

564
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,610
After the hospital
thing, Sonny got mad.

565
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,860
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
this morning.

566
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,990
Jesus Christ.

567
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,160
Looks like a fortress
around here.

568
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:57,670
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

569
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:01,340
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead.

570
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,470
Mike, let me look at you.

571
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,560
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

572
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:18,270
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

573
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,110
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

574
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,030
What did he say... He wants us to
send Michael to hear the proposition.

575
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,580
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

576
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,750
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

577
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:37,130
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

578
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,340
No more! Not this
time, Consigliere.

579
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,970
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

580
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:47,090
I want Sollozzo,
or we go to war...

581
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,140
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

582
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,520
This is business, not personal!

583
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:57,020
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

584
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:01,690
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

585
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:05,780
No more advice on how to patch things up.
Just help me win.

586
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,000
I found out about Captain
McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.

587
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,380
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

588
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:24,510
McCluskey has agreed to
be The Turk's bodyguard.

589
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:28,340
So when Sollozzo is being
guarded, he's invulnerable.

590
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:32,010
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

591
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:38,060
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

592
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:41,980
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

593
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,110
Do me a favor. Take this
into consideration.

594
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,950
All right, we'll wait.

595
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:01,210
We can't wait. We can't wait.

596
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,630
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

597
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,430
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

598
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:14,810
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

599
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:19,480
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

600
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,530
They want to have a
meeting with me, right?

601
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,830
It will be me, McCluskey
and Sollozzo.

602
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:36,830
Let's set the meeting.

603
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,710
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

604
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:48,340
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

605
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,180
Some place where there are
people, so I feel safe.

606
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,930
They'll search me when
I meet them, right?

607
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,350
So I can't have a weapon on me.

608
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:08,690
But if Clemenza can figure out a way
to have a weapon planted there for me

609
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,870
then I'll kill them both.

610
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,680
Nice college boy. Didn't want to get
mixed up in the family business.

611
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,430
Now you want to shoot a police
captain because he slapped you?

612
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:43,060
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

613
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:46,190
You're taking this
very personal.

614
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:49,690
Tom, this is business and
he's taking it personal.

615
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:53,280
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

616
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:59,500
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed
up in drugs, a dishonest cop.

617
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:04,830
A cop who got mixed up in the
rackets and got what was coming.

618
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,510
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

619
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:14,800
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

620
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:22,060
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

621
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,810
It's as cold as they come.

622
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,150
Impossible to trace, so you
don't worry about prints.

623
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:34,610
I put a special tape on the
trigger and the butt. Try it.

624
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:48,880
Is the trigger too tight?

625
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,420
My ears!

626
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:58,140
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

627
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:02,220
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

628
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,270
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

629
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:11,900
Let your hand drop to your
side and let the gun slip out.

630
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:16,410
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

631
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:19,370
so walk out fast, but don't run.

632
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:22,870
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

633
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:26,460
They'll be scared stiff, so
don't worry about nothing.

634
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,760
You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,

635
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,920
and we'll catch the hell.

636
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:39,390
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

637
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,520
All the other families will
probably line up against us.

638
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,415
These things have to happen
every five, 10 years.

639
01:16:45,416 --> 01:16:48,190
Gets rid of the bad blood.

640
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:52,730
Been 10 years since the last one. You
have to stop them at the beginning.

641
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:58,570
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

642
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:04,500
You know, Mike, we were all proud of you.
Being a hero and all.

643
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,290
Your father too.

644
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:47,790
Nothing. Not a hint.
Absolutely nothing.

645
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:53,000
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

646
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:55,420
How much time do we have?

647
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:01,090
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

648
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:06,970
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

649
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:12,900
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

650
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:18,110
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

651
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,570
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

652
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:25,700
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

653
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:29,120
Sollozzo might not even
be in the car, Sonny!

654
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,710
I'll get it.

655
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,150
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

656
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:01,570
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

657
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:07,410
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day.
He'll be there between 8 and 10.

658
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:12,370
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

659
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:17,420
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

660
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:23,340
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

661
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,430
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

662
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:32,640
All right. Mike, you
go to the restaurant,

663
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:36,610
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

664
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:42,030
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

665
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:46,570
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

666
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,830
I want somebody very
good to plant that gun.

667
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:54,420
I don't want him coming
out with just his dick.

668
01:19:54,500 --> 01:20:00,050
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

669
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,800
Let's move.

670
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,470
Did he tell you to drop
the gun right away?

671
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,430
Yeah, a million times.

672
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:21,400
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

673
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:31,580
How long do you think it will
be before I can come back?

674
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,500
At least a year.

675
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:39,420
I'll square it with Mom, that you're
not seeing her before you leave and...

676
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,800
I'll get a message to that
girlfriend when the time is right.

677
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,140
Take care.

678
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,690
Take care, Mike.

679
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:33,310
I'm glad you came. I hope we
can straighten everything out.

680
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,600
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

681
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:44,020
I want to straighten everything out. I
don't want my father bothered again.

682
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:47,360
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

683
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,660
But you have to keep an
open mind when we talk.

684
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,160
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

685
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,710
He's a good kid.

686
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:07,170
I'm sorry about the
other night, Mike.

687
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,340
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

688
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:21,150
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

689
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,400
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

690
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:30,110
He's clean.

691
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,020
Going to Jersey?

692
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,060
Maybe.

693
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,130
Nice work, Lou.

694
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:12,840
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

695
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,590
I'll have it.

696
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:53,340
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

697
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,630
What I want...

698
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,760
What's most important to me

699
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:24,720
is that I have a guarantee. No
more attempts on my father's life.

700
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:29,560
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

701
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,190
I missed my chance. You
think too much of me, kid.

702
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:35,110
I'm not that clever.

703
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:38,860
All I want is a truce.

704
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:49,250
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

705
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,130
When you got to go,
you got to go.

706
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,550
He's clean.

707
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:02,720
Don't take too long.

708
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,640
I've frisked a thousand punks.

709
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,270
Okay, you take over.

710
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:19,370
I love you, Grandpa.

711
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:25,000
I'm sorry, Pa. He
doesn't know you yet.

712
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:29,420
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

713
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:35,800
" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

714
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,100
Go with your mother.

715
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:43,310
Take them downstairs.

716
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,480
Go on, Carlo, you too.

717
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:54,900
Go on.

718
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:19,510
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

719
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:41,120
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

720
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:47,750
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

721
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:51,330
They hit us, so
we hit them back.

722
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:56,710
Through our newspaper contacts we've
been able to put out material

723
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,090
about McCluskey's link with
Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

724
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:03,300
So things are loosening up.

725
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,310
And I'm sending
Fredo to Las Vegas,

726
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:11,940
under the protection of
Don Francesco of L.A.

727
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:16,570
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

728
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:26,700
Where's Michael?

729
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:42,140
It was Michael who
killed Sollozzo.

730
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:47,770
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back.

731
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,540
I want you to find out where that
old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

732
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,580
I want him now.

733
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:17,210
Sonny, things are
starting to loosen up.

734
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:22,010
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

735
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:28,100
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

736
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:32,020
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

737
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:37,070
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

738
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:43,240
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

739
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,620
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

740
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,500
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

741
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:55,630
Ma made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

742
01:35:56,540 --> 01:36:00,920
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

743
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:05,180
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

744
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:08,600
That's because they've
started making big money.

745
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,980
Papa never talked
business at the table.

746
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:15,940
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

747
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:17,770
Don't interfere.

748
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:23,990
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

749
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,860
We don't discuss
business at the table.

750
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,710
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

751
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,260
Why are you so far
from the house?

752
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,590
You know I'm responsible to
your father for your life.

753
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,970
The bodyguards are here.

754
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:31,220
It's still dangerous...

755
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:34,100
We've heard from
Santino in New York...

756
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,770
Your enemies know you're here.

757
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:41,520
Did Santino say
when I can go back?

758
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,480
Not yet.

759
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:45,990
It's out of the question.

760
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:50,870
Where are you going now?

761
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:53,580
To Corleone.

762
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,450
Take my car.

763
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:59,830
I want to walk.

764
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,630
Be careful.

765
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,540
Where have all the men gone?

766
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,790
They're all dead from vendettas.

767
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:46,840
There are the names of the dead.

768
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:07,360
Hey, hey, take me to
the America, G.I.!

769
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,740
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable!

770
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:17,120
America! Take me to the America, G.
I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

771
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:37,100
Mamma Mia what a beauty.

772
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:48,360
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

773
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:58,580
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

774
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:23,430
Did you have a good hunt?

775
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:26,770
You know all the
girls around here?

776
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:28,770
We saw some real beauties.

777
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:33,110
One of them struck our
friend like a thunderbolt.

778
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,080
She would tempt the
devil himself.

779
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:48,880
Really put together.

780
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,000
Right, Calo?

781
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,760
Such hair, such mouth!

782
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:01,310
The girls around here are beautiful...
but virtuous.

783
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:04,230
This one had a purple dress...

784
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,730
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

785
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,770
A type more Greek than Italian.

786
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:15,030
Do you know her?

787
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:22,240
There's no girl like
that in this town.

788
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:26,160
My God, I understand!

789
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:31,290
What's wrong?

790
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:34,880
Let's go.

791
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,090
It's his daughter.

792
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:40,050
Tell him to come here.

793
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:44,810
Call him.

794
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:07,200
Fabrizio, you translate.

795
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:13,210
I apologize if I offended you.

796
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:17,630
I'm a stranger in this country.

797
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:20,800
I meant no disrespect to
you or your daughter.

798
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:29,140
I'm an American,
hiding in Sicily.

799
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,900
My name is Michael Corleone.

800
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:39,070
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

801
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:44,280
But then your daughter
would lose a father

802
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:48,250
instead of gaining a husband.

803
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,630
I want to meet your daughter.

804
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:03,890
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

805
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:06,220
With all respect.

806
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:16,270
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

807
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,280
What's her name?

808
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,790
I'll knock you dizzy.

809
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:28,630
Save it for the library.

810
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,970
We've got to pick up my sister.

811
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:54,740
What's the matter?

812
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,000
What's the matter?

813
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:02,710
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

814
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:05,960
It was my fault. I hit him.

815
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:09,840
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

816
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:18,350
I'm just going to get a
doctor to take a look at you.

817
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:20,940
Sonny, please don't do anything.

818
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,980
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

819
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:27,940
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

820
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:35,700
You spic slobs still
betting Yankees?

821
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:38,450
Tell them to stop
taking in action.

822
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:41,000
We lost enough money last week.

823
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,170
Come here, come here!

824
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:50,440
If you touch my sister
again, I'll kill you.

825
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:47,930
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

826
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:52,350
Yes, I have. I've tried
writing and calling.

827
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:56,270
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

828
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:58,900
All we know is that
he's all right.

829
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:05,070
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

830
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:10,330
Tom, will you give this
letter to Michael. Please?

831
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:17,040
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

832
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:19,920
He'll get in touch with you.

833
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:23,710
I let my cab go, so can I
call another one, please?

834
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,670
Come on. Sorry.

835
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:47,570
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

836
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:50,820
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

837
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:54,290
Tell him that I can't make
it tonight until later.

838
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,290
Bitch!

839
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:06,090
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

840
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:09,510
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

841
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:12,970
- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!

842
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:15,310
I'll vafangool you!

843
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:22,940
She has a filthy mouth,
this Guinea brat.

844
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:31,620
That's it, break it all, you
spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

845
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:43,960
Why don't you bring your
whore home for dinner?

846
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,630
Maybe I will.

847
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:56,560
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

848
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:00,560
You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up!
Clean it up!

849
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:05,150
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

850
01:55:05,230 --> 01:55:10,070
Clean it up. Clean
that up, you...

851
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,030
Clean it!

852
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:19,370
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be
a murderer, like your father!

853
01:55:19,450 --> 01:55:22,920
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

854
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,710
Come on, kill me!

855
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:27,920
Get out of here!

856
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,430
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

857
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:34,180
You Guinea brat.
Get out of here!

858
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:47,610
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

859
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:51,780
Connie, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

860
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:54,780
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

861
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:57,870
Yeah, Connie.

862
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:04,500
You wait there.

863
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:09,670
No, you just wait there.

864
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,090
Son-of-a-bitch.

865
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:17,390
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

866
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:24,640
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

867
01:56:32,650 --> 01:56:33,900
Sonny!

868
01:56:40,370 --> 01:56:42,370
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

869
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:45,330
Go after him, go on!

870
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:17,110
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

871
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:07,640
Give me a drop.

872
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:18,360
My wife is crying upstairs.

873
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:23,240
I hear cars coming to the house.

874
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:30,830
Consigliere of mine,

875
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:34,420
tell your Don what
everyone seems to know.

876
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,880
I didn't tell Mama anything.

877
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:41,090
I was about to come up and
wake you and tell you.

878
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:46,810
But you needed a drink first.

879
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,390
Yeah.

880
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:56,190
Well, now you've had your drink.

881
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:05,620
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

882
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:25,220
I want no inquiries made.

883
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:32,230
I want no acts of vengeance.

884
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:36,770
I want you to arrange a meeting

885
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:40,400
with the heads of
the five families.

886
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,400
This war stops now.

887
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:08,890
Call Bonasera.

888
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:11,140
I need him now.

889
02:01:23,530 --> 02:01:28,700
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

890
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:31,160
You owe your Don a service.

891
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:34,790
He has no doubt that
you will repay it.

892
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:37,040
He will be at your funeral
parlor in one hour.

893
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:39,210
Be there to greet him.

894
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:05,190
Well, my friend, are you
ready to do me this service?

895
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,360
Yes. What do you want me to do?

896
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:21,210
I want you to use all your
powers and all your skills.

897
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:28,300
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

898
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:47,440
Look how they massacred my boy.

899
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:19,730
It's safer to teach you English!

900
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:21,900
I know English...

901
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:26,770
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

902
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:35,780
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

903
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:38,490
How are things in Palermo?

904
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:48,550
Michael is teaching me to drive...
watch, I'll show you.

905
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:53,180
How are things in Palermo?

906
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:56,680
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

907
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,140
times are changing
for the worse.

908
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:06,810
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

909
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:14,700
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

910
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:21,870
What's wrong?

911
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,210
Bad news from America.

912
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:31,380
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

913
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:39,810
Let's go... you promised.

914
02:04:58,620 --> 02:04:59,620
Fabrizio!

915
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,120
Get the car.

916
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:06,670
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

917
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:10,340
No, take her to her father's
house until things are safe.

918
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:12,340
Okay, anything you say.

919
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:20,010
Calo, where is Apollonia?

920
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:24,270
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

921
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,600
She'll make a good
American wife.

922
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:32,610
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

923
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:45,040
Fabrizio!

924
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,790
Where are you going?

925
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,920
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

926
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:58,470
No, Apollonia!

927
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:27,370
Don Barzini, I want to thank you for
helping me organize this meeting,

928
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:32,340
and the other heads of the five
families from New York and New Jersey.

929
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:37,220
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

930
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:40,640
and from Brooklyn

931
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:44,350
Philip Tattaglia.

932
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:48,850
And from Staten Island

933
02:06:48,940 --> 02:06:52,440
we have with us Victor Strachi.

934
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:58,150
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

935
02:06:58,240 --> 02:07:01,990
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

936
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:12,290
How did things ever get so far?

937
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:14,000
I don't know.

938
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:19,550
It was so unfortunate,
so unnecessary.

939
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:26,100
Tattaglia lost a son,
and I lost a son.

940
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,980
We're quits. And if
Tattaglia agrees,

941
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:36,070
then I'm willing to let
things go on as before.

942
02:07:37,530 --> 02:07:41,150
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

943
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:46,620
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

944
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:50,790
Yes, Don Barzini.
He's too modest.

945
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:55,080
He had all the judges and
politicians in his pocket.

946
02:07:55,170 --> 02:07:58,050
He refused to share them.

947
02:07:58,130 --> 02:08:01,920
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

948
02:08:02,010 --> 02:08:04,390
All of you know me.

949
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:10,470
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

950
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:17,980
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

951
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:22,320
It's not like gambling
or liquor or even women,

952
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:28,370
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

953
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:33,210
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

954
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:37,500
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

955
02:08:37,590 --> 02:08:42,720
I believed that then and
I believe that now.

956
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:45,010
Times have changed.

957
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:49,850
It's not like the old days, when
we could do anything we wanted.

958
02:08:49,930 --> 02:08:52,810
A refusal is not the
act of a friend.

959
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:58,310
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

960
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,990
or let others use them. He must let
us draw the water from the well.

961
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:07,660
Certainly he can present a
bill for such services.

962
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:10,330
After all, we're not communists.

963
02:09:13,450 --> 02:09:16,540
I also don't believe in drugs.

964
02:09:16,670 --> 02:09:21,500
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

965
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:24,720
Somebody says to them
" I have powders."

966
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:28,050
" If you put up 3-4,000
dollar investment,

967
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:31,140
we can make 50,000
distributing."

968
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:38,270
They can't resist. I want to control
it as a business, keep it respectable.

969
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:43,150
I don't want it near schools, I
don't want it sold to children.

970
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:45,030
Thats an infàmia.

971
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:50,280
In my city we would keep the
traffic to the colored.

972
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:53,580
They're animals, so let
them lose their souls.

973
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:03,800
I hoped that we could come
here and reason together.

974
02:10:05,210 --> 02:10:11,850
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

975
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:16,980
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

976
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:21,360
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

977
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:25,190
I must have strict
assurance from Corleone.

978
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:28,570
As time goes by and his
position becomes stronger,

979
02:10:28,650 --> 02:10:31,320
will he attempt any
individual vendetta?

980
02:10:31,410 --> 02:10:36,540
We are all reasonable men. We
don't have to give assurances.

981
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:39,500
You talk about vengeance.

982
02:10:39,580 --> 02:10:42,840
Will vengeance bring
your son back to you?

983
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:45,460
Or my boy to me?

984
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:48,340
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

985
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:53,430
But I have selfish reasons.

986
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:59,310
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

987
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:03,730
because of this
Sollozzo business.

988
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:09,200
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

989
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:11,950
Cleared of all these
false charges.

990
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:16,490
But I'm a superstitious man.

991
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:21,920
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

992
02:11:23,290 --> 02:11:26,880
or if he should hang
himself in his jail cell,

993
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:29,840
or if he's struck by
a bolt of lightning,

994
02:11:31,130 --> 02:11:34,720
then I'm going to blame some
of the people in this room.

995
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:38,720
And that I do not forgive.

996
02:11:41,190 --> 02:11:43,560
But, that aside

997
02:11:46,650 --> 02:11:48,980
let me say that I swear

998
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:53,740
on the souls of
my grandchildren,

999
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:58,200
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1000
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:29,150
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1001
02:12:29,230 --> 02:12:31,360
Mention it. Don't insist.

1002
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:38,280
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1003
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:41,870
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1004
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:46,080
He could never have
outfought Santino.

1005
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:54,050
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1006
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,610
Come on, Nancy.

1007
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:15,400
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1008
02:13:16,740 --> 02:13:18,410
Okay, all right.

1009
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:33,710
How long have you been back?

1010
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:36,340
I've been back a year.

1011
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:39,890
Longer than that, I think.

1012
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,890
It's good to see you, Kay.

1013
02:13:55,950 --> 02:13:58,490
I'm working for my
father now, Kay.

1014
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:03,990
He's been sick. Very sick.

1015
02:14:05,540 --> 02:14:07,500
But you're not like him.

1016
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:11,380
You told me you weren't going
to become like your father.

1017
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:17,590
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1018
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:21,140
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1019
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:24,770
Like a senator or president.

1020
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:27,310
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1021
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:30,230
They don't have men killed.

1022
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:35,650
Who's being naive, Kay?

1023
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:41,160
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1024
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:47,080
In five years the Corleone family is
going to be completely legitimate.

1025
02:14:48,910 --> 02:14:52,880
Trust me. That's all I can tell
you about my business. Kay...

1026
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:57,460
Michael, why did you come here?
Why?

1027
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:01,180
What do you want with
me after all this time?

1028
02:15:01,181 --> 02:15:03,600
I've been calling and writing.

1029
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:07,180
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1030
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:11,100
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1031
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:15,400
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1032
02:15:17,150 --> 02:15:21,030
I'll do anything you ask to make
up for what's happened to us.

1033
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:26,950
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1034
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:31,750
we have each other. That
we have a life together.

1035
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:36,050
That we have children.
Our children.

1036
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:39,720
Kay, I need you.

1037
02:15:41,680 --> 02:15:43,260
And I love you.

1038
02:16:05,410 --> 02:16:09,160
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1039
02:16:09,290 --> 02:16:12,920
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1040
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,130
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1041
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:19,340
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1042
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:22,880
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1043
02:16:22,970 --> 02:16:26,850
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1044
02:16:28,350 --> 02:16:30,520
Don Corleone...

1045
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:34,730
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1046
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:38,860
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1047
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:42,530
Michael is now head
of the family.

1048
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:46,910
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1049
02:16:46,990 --> 02:16:49,370
After we make the move to Nevada

1050
02:16:49,450 --> 02:16:53,870
you can leave the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1051
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:58,290
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1052
02:16:58,380 --> 02:17:01,630
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1053
02:17:01,710 --> 02:17:04,550
me and Pete will come
under Barzini's thumb.

1054
02:17:04,630 --> 02:17:10,310
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1055
02:17:10,390 --> 02:17:13,310
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1056
02:17:13,390 --> 02:17:16,310
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1057
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:19,650
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1058
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:29,910
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1059
02:17:29,990 --> 02:17:32,330
That's all I can tell you now.

1060
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:35,750
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1061
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:39,210
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1062
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:44,090
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1063
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:46,720
That's no reflection on
Tom, just how I want it.

1064
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:51,510
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1065
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:15,370
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1066
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:18,370
Mike... Why am I out?

1067
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:22,590
You're not a wartime
consigliere, Tom.

1068
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:27,130
Things may get rough
with the move.

1069
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:28,510
Tom.

1070
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:38,850
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1071
02:18:38,940 --> 02:18:43,070
I thought Santino was a
bad Don, rest in peace.

1072
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:47,740
Michael has all my
confidence, just as you do.

1073
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:53,700
But there are reasons why you must have
no part in what is going to happen.

1074
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:57,790
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1075
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:51,260
I can't get over the way
your face looks. So good!

1076
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:55,970
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1077
02:19:56,050 --> 02:20:00,180
Leave them out here. He's
tired and wants to clean up.

1078
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:02,640
Let me open the door, all right?

1079
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:14,240
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1080
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:16,950
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1081
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:23,960
I'll be right back.
Keep them occupied.

1082
02:20:25,170 --> 02:20:28,670
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1083
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:33,510
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1084
02:20:35,050 --> 02:20:39,720
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1085
02:20:39,810 --> 02:20:42,480
I'm tired. Get rid
of the band too.

1086
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:51,650
Hey, take off. Take off.
Let's go.

1087
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:53,860
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1088
02:20:55,570 --> 02:20:57,700
Hey, come on! Scram!

1089
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:02,910
Come on, honey. I don't know what's
the matter with him, Johnny.

1090
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,290
Sorry.

1091
02:21:06,250 --> 02:21:08,790
I don't know. He's tired.

1092
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:18,890
What happened to Moe Greene?

1093
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:23,310
He had some business. He said to give
him a call when the party started.

1094
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:25,350
Well, give him a call.

1095
02:21:26,730 --> 02:21:29,860
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1096
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:32,150
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1097
02:21:32,230 --> 02:21:35,820
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1098
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:38,160
Well, I owe it all to him.

1099
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:40,950
He knows how grateful you are.

1100
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:44,290
That's why he'd like
to ask a favor of you.

1101
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:46,290
Mike, what can I do?

1102
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:49,920
We're thinking of
giving up our interests

1103
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,920
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1104
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:59,090
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1105
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:01,930
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1106
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:05,020
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothing about selling.

1107
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:07,810
I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1108
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:11,520
See, Johnny...

1109
02:22:11,610 --> 02:22:15,820
We figure that entertainment would
draw gamblers to the casino.

1110
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:19,660
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1111
02:22:22,580 --> 02:22:27,210
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1112
02:22:28,460 --> 02:22:30,580
We're counting on you.

1113
02:22:32,590 --> 02:22:36,260
Sure, Mike. I'll do
anything for my godfather.

1114
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:37,630
Good.

1115
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:43,890
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1116
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:46,520
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1117
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:51,730
Have everything? Specially prepared food,
the best dancers, and good credit.

1118
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:55,400
Draw chips for everybody, so
they can play on the house.

1119
02:22:58,070 --> 02:23:00,820
Is my credit good
enough to buy you out?

1120
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:04,410
Buy me out?

1121
02:23:04,490 --> 02:23:07,080
The casino, the hotel.

1122
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:10,080
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1123
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:15,590
The Corleone family wants to buy me out?
No, I buy you out.

1124
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:19,090
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1125
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:23,050
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1126
02:23:27,850 --> 02:23:30,270
You Guineas make me laugh.

1127
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:34,980
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1128
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:39,780
You did that because we
bankrolled your casino

1129
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:42,490
and the Molinari family
guaranteed his safety.

1130
02:23:42,491 --> 02:23:45,120
Let's talk business.

1131
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,950
Yes. First of all,
you're all done.

1132
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:50,500
You don't have that
kind of muscle anymore.

1133
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:55,000
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1134
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:59,010
Do you think you can come
to my hotel and take over?

1135
02:23:59,090 --> 02:24:04,140
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1136
02:24:04,220 --> 02:24:07,720
Is that why you slapped my
brother around in public?

1137
02:24:07,810 --> 02:24:12,640
That was nothing, Mike. Moe
didn't mean nothing by that.

1138
02:24:12,730 --> 02:24:16,940
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1139
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:21,780
I have a business to run. I've
got to kick asses sometimes.

1140
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:25,740
We had an argument, so I
had to straighten him out.

1141
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:28,660
You straightened my brother out?

1142
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:33,210
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1143
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:35,250
What's wrong with you?

1144
02:24:40,130 --> 02:24:43,260
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1145
02:24:44,180 --> 02:24:45,800
Son-of-a-bitch!

1146
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:51,060
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when
you were out with cheerleaders.

1147
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:53,640
Wait a minute, Moe.
I have an idea.

1148
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:58,320
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1149
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:03,820
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1150
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:07,240
If you have anything to
say, say it to Michael.

1151
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:16,960
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1152
02:25:17,710 --> 02:25:18,920
Fredo...

1153
02:25:20,130 --> 02:25:22,880
You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1154
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:28,350
But don't ever take sides with
anyone against the family again.

1155
02:25:29,850 --> 02:25:30,850
Ever.

1156
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:43,150
I have to see my father and his
people, so have dinner without me.

1157
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:49,780
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1158
02:25:57,170 --> 02:26:00,210
Your sister wants to
ask you something.

1159
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:02,420
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1160
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:05,470
They want you to be
godfather to their boy.

1161
02:26:05,550 --> 02:26:07,380
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1162
02:26:07,470 --> 02:26:09,800
Let me think about it. Come on.

1163
02:26:18,690 --> 02:26:21,560
Barzini will move
against you first.

1164
02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:26,070
He'll set up a meeting with
someone you absolutely trust.

1165
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:28,200
Guaranteeing your safety.

1166
02:26:29,450 --> 02:26:32,530
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1167
02:26:37,250 --> 02:26:40,250
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1168
02:26:41,670 --> 02:26:45,170
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1169
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:51,720
I don't know.

1170
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:56,680
Are you happy with your
wife and children?

1171
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:00,480
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1172
02:27:02,360 --> 02:27:07,240
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1173
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:10,280
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1174
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:14,740
I spend my life trying
not to be careless.

1175
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:19,750
Women and children can be
careless, but not men.

1176
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:25,420
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1177
02:27:25,550 --> 02:27:28,260
He looks more like
you every day.

1178
02:27:30,970 --> 02:27:35,430
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1179
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:39,600
Read the funny papers.

1180
02:27:46,820 --> 02:27:52,450
I want you to arrange for a telephone man
to check all in-and out-going calls.

1181
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:55,220
I did it already. I
took care of that, Pop.

1182
02:27:55,221 --> 02:27:57,870
That's right. I forgot.

1183
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,630
What's the matter?

1184
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:06,500
What's bothering you?

1185
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:14,720
I'll handle it. I told you I can
handle it, so I'll handle it.

1186
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:32,490
I knew that Santino would
have to go through all this.

1187
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:34,200
And Fredo...

1188
02:28:36,910 --> 02:28:38,950
Fredo was, well...

1189
02:28:40,830 --> 02:28:43,670
But I never wanted this for you.

1190
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:51,050
I worked my whole life. I don't
apologize for taking care of my family.

1191
02:28:51,130 --> 02:28:55,050
And I refused to be a fool,

1192
02:28:55,140 --> 02:28:59,260
dancing on a string held
by all those big shots.

1193
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:04,690
I don't apologize. That's my
life, but I thought that,

1194
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:11,530
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1195
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:18,990
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1196
02:29:19,080 --> 02:29:22,080
Another pezzonovante.

1197
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:23,830
Well...

1198
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:30,960
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1199
02:29:31,050 --> 02:29:34,550
We'll get there, Pop.
We'll get there.

1200
02:29:39,390 --> 02:29:43,850
Now listen, whoever comes to
you with this Barzini meeting,

1201
02:29:43,930 --> 02:29:46,900
he's the traitor.
Don't forget that.

1202
02:30:03,870 --> 02:30:06,000
Can I hold it, please?

1203
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:24,970
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1204
02:30:25,060 --> 02:30:27,850
Over here, over here.

1205
02:30:29,730 --> 02:30:32,230
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1206
02:30:38,610 --> 02:30:40,370
Anthony!

1207
02:30:40,450 --> 02:30:42,120
Come here, come here.

1208
02:30:47,290 --> 02:30:49,960
That's it. We'll put
it right there.

1209
02:30:55,170 --> 02:30:57,760
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1210
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:01,680
Stand there.

1211
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:07,180
Give me an orange!

1212
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:27,330
That's a new trick.

1213
02:31:28,330 --> 02:31:30,670
You run in there. Run in there.

1214
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:46,180
Where are you?

1215
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:46,240
Mike, can I have a minute?

1216
02:34:56,330 --> 02:34:58,790
Barzini wants to
arrange a meeting.

1217
02:34:58,870 --> 02:35:02,170
He says we can straighten
out any of our problems.

1218
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:05,050
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1219
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:10,180
I can arrange security.
On my territory.

1220
02:35:13,220 --> 02:35:15,770
- All right?
- All right.

1221
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:36,240
Do you know how they're
going to come at you?

1222
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:42,420
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn.
Tessio's ground.

1223
02:35:44,590 --> 02:35:46,380
Where I'll be safe.

1224
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:02,230
I always thought it would
be Clemenza, not Tessio.

1225
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:06,110
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1226
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:09,650
But I'm going to wait.

1227
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:11,320
After the baptism.

1228
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:18,790
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1229
02:36:18,870 --> 02:36:23,040
And then I'll meet with Don
Barzini and Tattaglia.

1230
02:36:24,630 --> 02:36:27,590
All the heads of
the five families.

1231
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:53,520
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1232
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:54,780
I do.

1233
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:58,360
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1234
02:38:58,450 --> 02:38:59,450
I do.

1235
02:38:59,530 --> 02:39:03,580
Do you believe in the Holy
Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?

1236
02:39:03,660 --> 02:39:04,950
I do.

1237
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:14,860
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1238
02:40:21,110 --> 02:40:22,360
I do renounce him.

1239
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:33,460
And all his works?

1240
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:48,390
I do renounce them.

1241
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:51,390
Oh, God!

1242
02:40:54,310 --> 02:40:57,980
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1243
02:41:13,750 --> 02:41:17,960
Michael Rizzi, will
you be baptized?

1244
02:41:18,040 --> 02:41:19,250
I will.

1245
02:41:26,390 --> 02:41:31,890
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and
may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1246
02:41:46,110 --> 02:41:48,030
Kay!

1247
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:50,080
Kiss your godfather.

1248
02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:18,560
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1249
02:42:18,650 --> 02:42:20,310
Everybody has to
leave without us.

1250
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:23,360
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1251
02:42:23,480 --> 02:42:26,990
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1252
02:42:28,110 --> 02:42:30,490
I'll only be a couple of days.

1253
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:48,970
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1254
02:42:51,140 --> 02:42:54,890
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1255
02:43:02,690 --> 02:43:08,110
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1256
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:11,740
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1257
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:13,990
I can't go either, Sal.

1258
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:29,880
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1259
02:43:31,550 --> 02:43:34,390
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1260
02:43:40,390 --> 02:43:42,860
Tom, can you get
me off the hook?

1261
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:47,190
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1262
02:44:32,610 --> 02:44:35,450
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1263
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:44,250
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1264
02:44:45,290 --> 02:44:49,210
That little farce you
played with my sister.

1265
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:54,390
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1266
02:44:54,470 --> 02:44:57,180
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1267
02:44:59,850 --> 02:45:02,140
Don't do this to me, please.

1268
02:45:11,400 --> 02:45:13,150
Barzini is dead.

1269
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:17,620
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1270
02:45:18,830 --> 02:45:20,330
Moe Greene.

1271
02:45:21,290 --> 02:45:25,080
Strachi. Cuneo.

1272
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:32,300
Today I settle all family business, so
don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1273
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:34,170
Admit what you did.

1274
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:39,760
Get him a drink.

1275
02:45:46,060 --> 02:45:47,350
Come on.

1276
02:45:48,690 --> 02:45:51,110
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1277
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:54,070
Do you think I'd make
my sister a widow?

1278
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:57,910
I'm godfather to
your son, Carlo.

1279
02:46:04,830 --> 02:46:06,870
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1280
02:46:11,670 --> 02:46:15,510
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1281
02:46:16,590 --> 02:46:20,550
You're finished. I'm putting
you on a plane to Vegas.

1282
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:22,260
Tom.

1283
02:46:26,390 --> 02:46:29,980
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1284
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:32,650
Only don't tell me
you're innocent.

1285
02:46:33,900 --> 02:46:38,160
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1286
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:44,450
Who approached you?

1287
02:46:45,750 --> 02:46:47,960
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1288
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:57,550
It was Barzini.

1289
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:03,260
Good.

1290
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:13,520
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1291
02:47:13,610 --> 02:47:17,150
I'll call your wife and tell
her what flight you're on.

1292
02:47:21,450 --> 02:47:23,990
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1293
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:51,770
Hello, Carlo.

1294
02:48:51,620 --> 02:48:54,750
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1295
02:49:03,130 --> 02:49:05,220
Michael!

1296
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:07,300
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1297
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:14,850
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1298
02:49:14,940 --> 02:49:19,020
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1299
02:49:19,110 --> 02:49:22,190
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1300
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:28,080
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1301
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:29,790
Connie.

1302
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:34,750
Why do you think he
kept Carlo at the Mall?

1303
02:49:34,830 --> 02:49:37,670
He knew he was
going to kill him.

1304
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:43,090
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1305
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:47,260
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1306
02:49:47,340 --> 02:49:50,100
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1307
02:49:59,770 --> 02:50:03,990
No! No, no...

1308
02:50:04,070 --> 02:50:07,450
Take her upstairs.
Get her a doctor.

1309
02:50:28,590 --> 02:50:30,300
She's hysterical.

1310
02:50:34,850 --> 02:50:36,600
Hysterical.

1311
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:40,310
Michael, is it true?

1312
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:45,990
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1313
02:50:46,070 --> 02:50:48,820
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1314
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:10,390
All right.

1315
02:51:13,220 --> 02:51:14,970
This one time.

02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:22,270
This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1317
02:51:28,360 --> 02:51:29,780
Is it true?

1318
02:51:33,870 --> 02:51:35,370
Is it?

1319
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:38,500
No.

1320
02:51:52,430 --> 02:51:55,390
I guess we both need a drink.
Come on.

1321
02:52:26,670 --> 02:52:28,380
Don Corleone.
