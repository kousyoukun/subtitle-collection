1
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,465
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,536
America has made my fortune.

3
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:26,732
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:31,608
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

5
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:36,141
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:40,779
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:42,618
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:48,358
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:52,026
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:56,399
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:56,538 --> 00:02:00,838
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:05,743
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:11,818
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:16,687
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,961
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:27,627
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:32,970
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:36,272
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,950
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,549
Sorry.

21
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:03,730
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:06,534
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:12,706
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:19,084
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:24,354
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

26
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:28,224
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

27
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:35,225
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

28
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:44,542
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,778
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,580
What is that?

31
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:05,363
I want them dead.

32
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:18,543
That I cannot do.

33
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:22,773
I'll give you anything you ask.

34
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,683
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

35
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:37,029
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,797
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

37
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:46,874
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,740
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,313
I didn't want to get into trouble.

40
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,180
I understand.

41
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,220
You found Paradise in America.

42
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:07,325
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

43
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:10,158
You didn't need a friend like me.

44
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,292
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,270
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

46
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,542
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:28,116
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

48
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:36,057
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,682
I ask you for justice.

50
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:41,625
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

51
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,599
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,601
How much shall I pay you?

53
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,223
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:13,418
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

55
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:17,057
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,602
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

57
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:28,040
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,712
And then they would fear you.

59
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,345
Be my friend?

60
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,284
Godfather?

61
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:50,391
Good.

62
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:57,633
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

63
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,201
But until that day...

64
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:07,144
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:09,842
- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego.

66
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:19,794
Give this to Clemenza.

67
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,322
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

68
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:29,631
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

69
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:58,299
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

70
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,231
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

71
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,574
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

72
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,623
Don Barzini.

73
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,308
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

74
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,680
Paulie! More wine.

75
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:31,792
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

76
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,986
Take a walk and do your job.

77
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,035
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

78
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:48,108
You watch yourself, all right?

79
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:12,958
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

80
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,062
In that little silk purse.

81
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:19,970
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

82
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:22,508
Hey, Paulie!

83
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,474
Stupid jerk!

84
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,424
What's the matter?

85
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,204
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

86
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,572
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

87
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:07,448
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

88
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,557
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

89
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:19,533
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

90
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:29,406
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

91
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,440
Come here, come here, come here!

92
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,960
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

93
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:57,128
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

94
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:59,968
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

95
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,042
Now that the war is over,

96
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:06,079
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

97
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:11,242
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

98
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,814
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

99
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,223
You understand everything.

100
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,495
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

101
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:30,566
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

102
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:33,469
The bride, the groom and the angel...

103
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:43,140
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisa.

104
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:48,586
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

105
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:57,189
Hey, Michael!

106
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:20,387
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

107
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:28,493
Is this necessary?

108
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,192
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

109
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:40,266
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

110
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:45,641
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

111
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:48,147
Michael...

112
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,114
That man over there
is talking to himself.

113
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:56,314
See that scary guy over there?

114
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:59,893
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

115
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:04,465
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

116
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,734
Michael, he's coming over here!

117
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,406
You look terrific!

118
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,808
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

119
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,746
Your father's been asking for you.

120
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:25,717
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:30,150
Why does your brother
have a different name?

122
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,954
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

123
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:38,691
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

124
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,835
He's been with us ever since.

125
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:44,939
He's a good lawyer.

126
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,434
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

127
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,479
- What's that?
- That's a...

128
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:57,244
...like a counsellor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

129
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,480
You like your lasagne?

130
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:06,987
Don Corleone.

131
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:09,619
I'm honoured and grateful

132
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:13,723
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

133
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,834
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

134
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:27,209
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

135
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:33,720
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

136
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,383
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

137
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:46,026
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

138
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:47,966
Thank you.

139
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,917
Signora Corleone!

140
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,113
No!

141
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:57,955
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

142
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:02,331
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

143
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:06,670
What is that outside?

144
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,685
Johnny! Johnny!

145
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:22,983
I love you!

146
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:36,661
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

147
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:40,296
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

148
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:45,806
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

149
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:04,029
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

150
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:08,101
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

151
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:12,138
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

152
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:13,365
How?

153
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:17,776
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

154
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,040
Please, Michael. Tell me.

155
00:19:57,852 --> 00:20:02,687
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

156
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,656
with a big bandleader.

157
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:10,924
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

158
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:13,556
Johnny is my father's godson.

159
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:17,137
My father went to see this bandleader.

160
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:21,105
He offered him 10,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

161
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,904
but the bandleader said no.

162
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:29,415
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

163
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:33,513
Within an hour,

164
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:39,422
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

165
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:44,828
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

166
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:51,536
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

167
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:56,905
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

168
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,611
That's a true story.

169
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:17,626
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

170
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,873
Beautiful!

171
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,213
I'll take care of it.

172
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,212
Tom...

173
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,944
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

174
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,161
How are you, Fredo?

175
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,890
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

176
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,401
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

177
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:34,674
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

178
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,277
Yeah. This is your friend?

179
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:42,781
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

180
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:50,187
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

181
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:55,728
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

182
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:58,957
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

183
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,537
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

184
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:08,772
Sonny?

185
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:11,503
Sonny?

186
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,211
Sonny?

187
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:22,815
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

188
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:24,481
The old man wants you.

189
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,855
One minute.

190
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:47,212
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

191
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,806
The main character
is a guy just like me.

192
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:53,613
I wouldn't even have to act.

193
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,589
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

194
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:03,126
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

195
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:08,930
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
finocchio, that cries like a woman?

196
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:12,869
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

197
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,838
Ridiculous.

198
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:22,643
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

199
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:24,273
Good.

200
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:29,685
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

201
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:38,231
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

202
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:43,598
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

203
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:46,900
It's too late, they start shooting
in a week.

204
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:50,169
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

205
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:57,973
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

206
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:03,514
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

207
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:33,514
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

208
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:37,021
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

209
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:42,527
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

210
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:45,461
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

211
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,036
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

212
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:54,839
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

213
00:25:54,975 --> 00:26:00,379
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

214
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:05,819
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

215
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:10,624
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

216
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,521
Wait a minute.

217
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:16,061
No, Michael. Not me.

218
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:23,598
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

219
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,816
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

220
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,181
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

221
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,949
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr Woltz,

222
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,719
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

223
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,158
Woltz is listening.

224
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:33,790
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

225
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:44,101
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr Woltz?

226
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,645
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

227
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:51,842
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

228
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:56,251
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

229
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,793
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

230
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:05,558
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

231
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:09,533
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

232
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,970
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

233
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:17,475
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

234
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:22,981
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

235
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:27,954
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

236
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:35,093
Check him out.

237
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,210
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

238
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:03,847
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

239
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,357
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

240
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:10,827
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

241
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:14,127
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

242
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:17,669
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

243
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:20,705
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

244
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:26,335
There you are.
600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

245
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,109
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

246
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,774
Khartoum.

247
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:34,048
Khartoum.

248
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:39,824
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

249
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:42,792
Thanks, Tony.

250
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,690
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:50,098
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

252
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:54,697
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

253
00:30:54,841 --> 00:31:00,177
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

254
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:04,482
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

255
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:10,648
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

256
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:14,557
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

257
00:31:14,695 --> 00:31:18,461
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

258
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:25,400
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable proteges.

259
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:30,875
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

260
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:35,573
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

261
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:38,378
Let me be even more frank.

262
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:43,478
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

263
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:47,185
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

264
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:52,594
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

265
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:58,968
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

266
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:00,801
And she runs off.

267
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:05,135
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

268
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:11,478
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

269
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:13,848
You get the hell out of here!

270
00:32:13,987 --> 00:32:18,356
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

271
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:22,585
Yeah, I heard that story.

272
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:27,365
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

273
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:30,231
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

274
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,136
Mr Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

275
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:30,655
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

276
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,760
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

277
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:35,156
Now...

278
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:42,258
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

279
00:34:42,936 --> 00:34:47,270
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

280
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:50,376
His business is narcotics.

281
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,946
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

282
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,039
In Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

283
00:34:58,185 --> 00:35:01,621
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

284
00:35:01,755 --> 00:35:05,691
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

285
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:11,025
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

286
00:35:12,032 --> 00:35:16,799
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

287
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:19,405
He's known as a top narcotics man.

288
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:24,977
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

289
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:28,110
Tom?

290
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:32,412
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

291
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:37,251
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

292
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:41,759
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

293
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:43,988
Then they come after us.

294
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,330
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

295
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,204
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

296
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,340
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

297
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,553
Don Corleone.

298
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:15,357
I need a man who has powerful friends.

299
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:18,089
I need a million dollars in cash.

300
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:24,067
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

301
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:29,566
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

302
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,611
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

303
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:35,874
And then it would go up.

304
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:40,284
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

305
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:44,347
My compliments.

306
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,355
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

307
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:55,497
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

308
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:59,036
political influence and legal protection?

309
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,867
That's right.

310
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:05,910
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

311
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:11,245
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

312
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:13,716
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

313
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:29,228
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

314
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:31,667
to be treated with respect.

315
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,742
But, I must say no to you.

316
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:43,282
And I'll give you my reason.

317
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,583
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

318
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:52,154
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

319
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:57,958
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

320
00:37:58,098 --> 00:38:02,967
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

321
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:08,370
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

322
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:12,569
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

323
00:38:12,979 --> 00:38:16,471
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

324
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:28,319
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

325
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:32,124
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

326
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:37,532
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

327
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:40,970
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

328
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:46,170
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

329
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:08,328
Santino.

330
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:10,436
Come here.

331
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:19,202
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

332
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:23,748
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

333
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,180
Go on.

334
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:32,718
Tom, what's this nonsense?

335
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,625
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

336
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:41,495
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

337
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:44,226
And...

338
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:47,639
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

339
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:56,846
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

340
00:39:56,983 --> 00:39:59,713
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

341
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,547
Go to the Tattaglias.

342
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:10,152
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

343
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,821
and find out what you can.

344
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:33,447
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

345
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:38,455
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

346
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,924
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

347
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:15,324
Andiamo, Fredo.

348
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:18,919
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

349
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:22,933
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

350
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:27,899
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

351
00:41:31,444 --> 00:41:33,435
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

352
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:20,818
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

353
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:32,002
You know who I am?

354
00:42:32,138 --> 00:42:33,605
I know you.

355
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,176
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

356
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:43,309
I think you and I can do business.

357
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:47,409
I need someone strong like you.

358
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:51,182
I heard you are not happy...

359
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:53,588
...with the Corleone family.

360
00:42:53,726 --> 00:42:57,355
Want to join me?

361
00:42:57,497 --> 00:42:59,897
What's in it for me?

362
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:03,764
$50,000 to start with.

363
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:09,503
Not bad!

364
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:12,406
Agreed?

365
00:44:10,603 --> 00:44:14,300
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

366
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,434
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

367
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:22,605
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

368
00:44:24,384 --> 00:44:29,048
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

369
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:30,553
Get in.

370
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:45,164
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

371
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:54,935
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

372
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:26,395
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

373
00:46:29,442 --> 00:46:30,602
No.

374
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:35,476
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

375
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,107
Michael.

376
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:44,417
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

377
00:47:00,773 --> 00:47:03,571
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

378
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:28,864
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

379
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:31,663
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

380
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:36,639
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

381
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:40,903
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:47:41,047 --> 00:47:45,507
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

383
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:50,315
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

384
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,527
Oh, my God.

385
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:04,926
Sonny!

386
00:48:13,879 --> 00:48:15,847
Stay back there.

387
00:48:15,982 --> 00:48:18,746
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

388
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,146
There's more news about your old man.

389
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:26,952
Word is out that he's already dead.

390
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:30,961
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

391
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:34,294
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

392
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:37,368
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

393
00:48:37,503 --> 00:48:40,802
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

394
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,536
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

395
00:48:45,678 --> 00:48:49,011
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

396
00:48:58,124 --> 00:49:01,525
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

397
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,057
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

398
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,134
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

399
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:13,761
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

400
00:49:13,906 --> 00:49:17,205
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

401
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:21,905
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

402
00:49:22,048 --> 00:49:23,743
I'll wait.

403
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:40,055
Your boss is dead.

404
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:47,339
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

405
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:52,810
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

406
00:49:56,315 --> 00:50:00,809
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

407
00:50:02,355 --> 00:50:03,617
Drink it.

408
00:50:07,993 --> 00:50:11,451
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

409
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:18,665
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

410
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:22,939
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

411
00:50:24,076 --> 00:50:29,514
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

412
00:50:30,616 --> 00:50:36,384
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

413
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:42,251
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

414
00:50:42,395 --> 00:50:48,231
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

415
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:53,595
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

416
00:50:57,476 --> 00:51:01,970
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

417
00:51:03,215 --> 00:51:09,620
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

418
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:16,527
It's good business, Tom.

419
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:22,797
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

420
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:27,201
Yeah, well...

421
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:31,373
Let me worry about Luca.

422
00:51:36,682 --> 00:51:38,547
You just talk to Sonny.

423
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:41,381
And the other two kids.

424
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:47,089
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

425
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:52,256
Now you can go.

426
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:03,270
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

427
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:05,877
Blood is a big expense.

428
00:52:26,932 --> 00:52:28,729
He's still alive.

429
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:32,861
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

430
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:37,999
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

431
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:26,722
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

432
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:35,423
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

433
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:39,129
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

434
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:41,671
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

435
00:53:41,807 --> 00:53:46,176
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

436
00:53:46,312 --> 00:53:49,770
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

437
00:53:49,915 --> 00:53:53,817
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

438
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:58,219
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

439
00:53:59,892 --> 00:54:05,091
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

440
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:12,433
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

441
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:17,873
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

442
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:22,640
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

443
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:24,442
If your father dies...

444
00:54:26,986 --> 00:54:28,419
...you make the deal.

445
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:33,355
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

446
00:54:38,263 --> 00:54:39,787
What is it?

447
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:46,499
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

448
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:49,199
Tessio, go see what it is.

449
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:54,307
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

450
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:58,143
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

451
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:01,810
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

452
00:55:01,954 --> 00:55:04,514
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

453
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:11,122
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

454
00:55:11,263 --> 00:55:15,666
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

455
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:20,228
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

456
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:24,399
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

457
00:55:26,745 --> 00:55:30,272
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

458
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,250
Try Luca again.

459
00:55:42,227 --> 00:55:44,991
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

460
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,621
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

461
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,773
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

462
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:05,577
Probably late.

463
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:11,989
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:18,486
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

465
00:56:19,965 --> 00:56:23,423
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

466
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:29,371
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

467
00:56:29,508 --> 00:56:32,966
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

468
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:36,809
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

469
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:38,678
Watch the kids.

470
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:55,330
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

471
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:56,798
Yeah, all right.

472
00:56:56,935 --> 00:57:01,372
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

473
00:57:01,507 --> 00:57:05,637
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

474
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:09,874
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

475
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:19,180
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

476
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:04,097
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

477
00:58:23,722 --> 00:58:25,519
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

478
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:28,959
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

479
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,566
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

480
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,172
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

481
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:46,106
He's going to make it.

482
00:58:46,845 --> 00:58:48,676
I love you.

483
00:58:49,948 --> 00:58:51,540
I love you!

484
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:54,985
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,021
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

486
00:58:58,156 --> 00:59:00,021
Can't you say it?

487
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:02,993
I'll see you tonight.

488
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:06,888
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

489
00:59:07,032 --> 00:59:11,833
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

490
00:59:12,905 --> 00:59:17,740
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

491
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:21,539
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

492
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,050
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

493
00:59:27,185 --> 00:59:31,349
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

494
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:35,317
Add a little bit of wine.

495
00:59:38,597 --> 00:59:43,000
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

496
00:59:43,135 --> 00:59:47,401
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

497
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:49,769
You won't see him no more.

498
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:53,643
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

499
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:57,237
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

500
00:59:57,382 --> 01:00:00,715
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

501
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:02,979
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

502
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:08,188
Send somebody with him anyway.

503
01:00:36,655 --> 01:00:40,022
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

504
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:45,822
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

505
01:00:45,964 --> 01:00:48,262
I'll wait in the cab.

506
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:53,030
I don't want you to get involved.

507
01:00:55,774 --> 01:00:58,242
When will I see you again?

508
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:08,412
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

509
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:15,082
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

510
01:03:27,092 --> 01:03:30,892
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

511
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:34,521
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

512
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:37,226
What happened to the guards?

513
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:42,397
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

514
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:45,908
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

515
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:54,284
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

516
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:59,788
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

517
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:08,096
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

518
01:04:08,233 --> 01:04:12,260
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's all alone.

519
01:04:12,404 --> 01:04:15,100
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

520
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:19,443
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

521
01:04:22,214 --> 01:04:27,982
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

522
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:31,611
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

523
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:35,988
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

524
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:38,118
Help me, please.

525
01:05:54,973 --> 01:05:58,773
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

526
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:01,938
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

527
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,015
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

528
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:09,780
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

529
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:15,884
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

530
01:06:16,027 --> 01:06:18,086
I'll be out in a minute.

531
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:35,970
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

532
01:06:37,615 --> 01:06:39,640
I'm with you now.

533
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:42,776
I'm with you.

534
01:07:18,323 --> 01:07:20,450
Get rid of these. Come here.

535
01:07:21,426 --> 01:07:25,590
Put your hand in your pocket, like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

536
01:08:17,248 --> 01:08:19,216
You did good.

537
01:09:07,398 --> 01:09:10,595
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

538
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:15,172
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

539
01:09:15,306 --> 01:09:19,208
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

540
01:09:19,344 --> 01:09:25,374
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

541
01:09:26,084 --> 01:09:29,417
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

542
01:09:29,554 --> 01:09:33,786
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

543
01:09:35,593 --> 01:09:41,395
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

544
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,492
Stand him up straight.

545
01:10:05,757 --> 01:10:11,457
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

546
01:10:11,596 --> 01:10:13,860
They're licensed to carry firearms.

547
01:10:13,998 --> 01:10:18,492
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

548
01:10:18,636 --> 01:10:20,831
Let him go.

549
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:56,868
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

550
01:10:57,008 --> 01:10:59,533
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

551
01:10:59,677 --> 01:11:02,805
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

552
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:06,116
Jesus Christ.

553
01:11:12,991 --> 01:11:15,687
Looks like a fortress around here.

554
01:11:17,428 --> 01:11:22,889
Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

555
01:11:23,034 --> 01:11:26,663
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

556
01:11:28,706 --> 01:11:30,697
Mike, let me look at you.

557
01:11:34,779 --> 01:11:37,771
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

558
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:43,581
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

559
01:11:43,721 --> 01:11:46,383
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

560
01:11:46,524 --> 01:11:51,188
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

561
01:11:51,329 --> 01:11:54,787
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

562
01:11:54,932 --> 01:11:57,992
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

563
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:02,300
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

564
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,500
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

565
01:12:05,643 --> 01:12:09,170
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

566
01:12:09,313 --> 01:12:12,111
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

567
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:15,344
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

568
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:18,080
This is business, not personal!

569
01:12:18,222 --> 01:12:23,091
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

570
01:12:23,227 --> 01:12:26,924
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

571
01:12:27,065 --> 01:12:31,092
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

572
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:41,275
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

573
01:12:41,412 --> 01:12:45,610
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

574
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,709
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

575
01:12:49,854 --> 01:12:53,688
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

576
01:12:53,825 --> 01:12:57,352
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

577
01:12:57,495 --> 01:13:03,297
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

578
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:07,131
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

579
01:13:08,606 --> 01:13:12,770
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

580
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,410
All right, we'll wait.

581
01:13:23,521 --> 01:13:26,581
We can't wait. We can't wait.

582
01:13:27,892 --> 01:13:31,760
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

583
01:13:31,896 --> 01:13:35,662
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

584
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,100
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

585
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,902
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

586
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:52,711
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

587
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:58,415
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

588
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,287
Let's set the meeting.

589
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:08,460
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

590
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:13,462
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

591
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:17,768
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

592
01:14:20,178 --> 01:14:23,045
They'll search me when I meet them,
right?

593
01:14:23,181 --> 01:14:25,479
So I can't have a weapon on me.

594
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:34,652
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

595
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:41,626
...then I'll kill them both.

596
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:57,910
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

597
01:14:58,049 --> 01:15:01,644
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

598
01:15:01,786 --> 01:15:08,282
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

599
01:15:08,426 --> 01:15:11,452
You're taking this very personal.

600
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:15,032
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

601
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:18,795
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

602
01:15:18,936 --> 01:15:25,637
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

603
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:29,712
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

604
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:34,945
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

605
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:40,181
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

606
01:15:43,728 --> 01:15:47,289
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

607
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:55,600
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

608
01:15:55,740 --> 01:16:00,109
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

609
01:16:12,056 --> 01:16:14,149
Is the trigger too tight?

610
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:18,755
My ears!

611
01:16:18,896 --> 01:16:24,493
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

612
01:16:24,635 --> 01:16:27,263
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

613
01:16:29,507 --> 01:16:33,466
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

614
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:37,103
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

615
01:16:37,248 --> 01:16:41,514
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

616
01:16:41,652 --> 01:16:44,587
so walk out fast, but don't run.

617
01:16:44,722 --> 01:16:48,089
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

618
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:51,558
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

619
01:16:53,831 --> 01:16:57,995
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

620
01:16:58,135 --> 01:16:59,830
and we'll catch the hell.

621
01:17:00,838 --> 01:17:04,569
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

622
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:07,769
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

623
01:17:07,912 --> 01:17:13,441
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

624
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:18,021
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

625
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:24,219
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

626
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:29,632
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

627
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:31,701
Your father too.

628
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:13,043
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

629
01:18:14,045 --> 01:18:18,243
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

630
01:18:18,382 --> 01:18:21,215
How much time do we have?

631
01:18:21,352 --> 01:18:26,153
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

632
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:32,485
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

633
01:18:33,631 --> 01:18:38,193
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

634
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:43,295
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

635
01:18:43,441 --> 01:18:46,968
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

636
01:18:47,111 --> 01:18:50,877
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

637
01:18:51,015 --> 01:18:54,348
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

638
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:55,816
I'll get it.

639
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:23,543
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

640
01:19:23,681 --> 01:19:26,445
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

641
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:32,580
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

642
01:19:32,723 --> 01:19:37,456
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

643
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:42,692
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

644
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:48,871
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

645
01:19:50,608 --> 01:19:53,076
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

646
01:19:53,744 --> 01:19:57,874
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

647
01:19:58,015 --> 01:20:01,951
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

648
01:20:02,086 --> 01:20:07,251
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

649
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:12,021
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

650
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:16,089
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

651
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:19,202
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

652
01:20:19,637 --> 01:20:25,303
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

653
01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:27,842
Let's move.

654
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:35,710
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

655
01:20:35,853 --> 01:20:37,753
Yeah, a million times.

656
01:20:42,526 --> 01:20:47,054
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

657
01:20:53,237 --> 01:20:56,434
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

658
01:20:57,808 --> 01:20:59,799
At least a year.

659
01:20:59,944 --> 01:21:05,075
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

660
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:09,708
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

661
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:17,656
Take care.

662
01:21:20,531 --> 01:21:22,294
Take care, Mike.

663
01:21:54,798 --> 01:21:58,598
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

664
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:04,807
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

665
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:09,242
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

666
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:12,645
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

667
01:22:13,717 --> 01:22:16,880
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

668
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:22,687
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

669
01:22:22,826 --> 01:22:24,987
He's a good kid.

670
01:22:28,999 --> 01:22:32,526
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

671
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:37,073
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

672
01:22:41,645 --> 01:22:46,378
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

673
01:22:47,651 --> 01:22:51,587
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

674
01:22:53,924 --> 01:22:55,016
He's clean.

675
01:23:22,052 --> 01:23:24,316
Going to Jersey?

676
01:23:26,824 --> 01:23:28,382
Maybe.

677
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,709
Nice work, Lou.

678
01:24:32,389 --> 01:24:38,055
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

679
01:24:38,195 --> 01:24:39,856
I'll have it.

680
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:18,698
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

681
01:26:38,081 --> 01:26:39,810
What I want...

682
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:43,476
What's most important to me...

683
01:26:45,722 --> 01:26:49,954
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

684
01:26:50,093 --> 01:26:54,291
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

685
01:26:54,932 --> 01:26:57,958
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

686
01:26:58,535 --> 01:27:00,264
I'm not that clever.

687
01:27:01,905 --> 01:27:04,135
All I want is a truce.

688
01:27:10,781 --> 01:27:14,410
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

689
01:27:15,953 --> 01:27:17,420
When you got to go, you got to go.

690
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,384
He's clean.

691
01:27:26,029 --> 01:27:28,088
Don't take too long.

692
01:27:31,368 --> 01:27:32,960
I've frisked a thousand punks.

693
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,728
Okay, you take over.

694
01:32:43,013 --> 01:32:45,072
I love you, Grandpa.

695
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:50,542
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

696
01:32:51,621 --> 01:32:54,715
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

697
01:32:54,858 --> 01:33:01,195
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

698
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:06,360
Go with your mother.

699
01:33:06,503 --> 01:33:08,630
Take them downstairs.

700
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:17,102
Go on, Carlo, you too.

701
01:33:18,548 --> 01:33:20,243
Go on.

702
01:33:40,804 --> 01:33:44,467
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

703
01:34:00,323 --> 01:34:06,455
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

704
01:34:08,098 --> 01:34:12,933
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

705
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:16,561
They hit us, so we hit them back.

706
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:21,901
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

707
01:34:22,045 --> 01:34:26,277
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

708
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:28,475
So things are loosening up.

709
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:37,125
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

710
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:42,357
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

711
01:34:50,073 --> 01:34:52,064
Where's Michael?

712
01:35:04,187 --> 01:35:07,486
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

713
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:13,221
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

714
01:35:34,684 --> 01:35:39,178
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

715
01:35:39,322 --> 01:35:42,416
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

716
01:35:42,559 --> 01:35:47,189
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

717
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:53,360
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

718
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:57,303
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

719
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:02,503
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

720
01:36:02,645 --> 01:36:08,481
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

721
01:36:08,618 --> 01:36:10,916
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

722
01:36:14,324 --> 01:36:16,622
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

723
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:20,930
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

724
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:26,168
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

725
01:36:26,302 --> 01:36:30,329
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

726
01:36:30,473 --> 01:36:33,772
That's because they've started
making big money.

727
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:37,346
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

728
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:41,211
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

729
01:36:42,218 --> 01:36:43,913
Don't interfere.

730
01:36:45,288 --> 01:36:49,349
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

731
01:36:49,492 --> 01:36:52,461
We don't discuss business at the table.

732
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:41,877
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

733
01:37:47,784 --> 01:37:49,775
Why are you so far
from the house?

734
01:37:50,453 --> 01:37:52,683
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

735
01:37:52,822 --> 01:37:54,949
The bodyguards are here.

736
01:37:55,091 --> 01:37:57,525
It's still dangerous...

737
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:00,424
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

738
01:38:00,563 --> 01:38:03,896
Your enemies know you're here.

739
01:38:04,033 --> 01:38:07,264
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

740
01:38:07,403 --> 01:38:09,200
Not yet.

741
01:38:09,339 --> 01:38:12,172
It's out of the question.

742
01:38:15,078 --> 01:38:17,808
Where are you going now?

743
01:38:19,215 --> 01:38:22,048
Take my car.

744
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:25,952
I want to walk.

745
01:38:28,024 --> 01:38:29,855
Be careful.

746
01:39:03,293 --> 01:39:04,988
Where have all the men gone?

747
01:39:05,128 --> 01:39:07,892
They're all dead from vendettas.

748
01:39:10,366 --> 01:39:13,164
There are the names of the dead.

749
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:32,419
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

750
01:39:32,555 --> 01:39:36,958
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

751
01:39:37,093 --> 01:39:42,531
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

752
01:40:00,249 --> 01:40:02,240
Mamma mia what a beauty.

753
01:40:11,461 --> 01:40:13,861
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

754
01:40:18,935 --> 01:40:24,100
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

755
01:40:47,397 --> 01:40:49,365
Did you have a good hunt?

756
01:40:49,499 --> 01:40:52,161
You know all the girls
around here?

757
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:54,792
We saw some real beauties.

758
01:40:54,937 --> 01:40:59,374
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

759
01:41:01,611 --> 01:41:05,672
She would tempt the devil himself.

760
01:41:11,287 --> 01:41:14,723
Really put together.

761
01:41:18,094 --> 01:41:21,257
Such hair, such mouth!

762
01:41:23,232 --> 01:41:26,861
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

763
01:41:27,003 --> 01:41:29,597
This one had a purple dress...

764
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:32,435
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

765
01:41:32,575 --> 01:41:36,705
A type more Greek than Italian.

766
01:41:38,347 --> 01:41:41,077
Do you know her?

767
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,921
There's no girl like that
in this town.

768
01:41:49,926 --> 01:41:52,656
My God, I understand!

769
01:41:55,898 --> 01:41:58,059
What's wrong?

770
01:41:59,535 --> 01:42:01,435
Let's go.

771
01:42:02,338 --> 01:42:03,737
It's his daughter.

772
01:42:03,873 --> 01:42:06,205
Tell him to come here.

773
01:42:08,511 --> 01:42:10,069
Call him.

774
01:42:30,132 --> 01:42:32,760
Fabrizio, you translate.

775
01:42:36,472 --> 01:42:39,373
I apologise if I offended you.

776
01:42:39,509 --> 01:42:42,672
I'm a stranger in this country.

777
01:42:42,812 --> 01:42:46,270
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

778
01:42:51,454 --> 01:42:54,685
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

779
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:57,989
My name is Michael Corleone.

780
01:42:59,896 --> 01:43:03,992
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

781
01:43:06,302 --> 01:43:09,362
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

782
01:43:10,873 --> 01:43:13,706
...instead of gaining a husband.

783
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:24,281
I want to meet your daughter.

784
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:28,982
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

785
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:31,524
With all respect.

786
01:43:37,633 --> 01:43:43,230
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

787
01:43:47,777 --> 01:43:50,974
What's her name?

788
01:46:43,853 --> 01:46:46,014
I'll knock you dizzy.

789
01:46:51,761 --> 01:46:53,854
Save it for the library.

790
01:46:57,333 --> 01:46:59,961
We've got to pick up my sister.

791
01:47:18,187 --> 01:47:19,745
What's the matter?

792
01:47:22,391 --> 01:47:24,188
What's the matter?

793
01:47:25,961 --> 01:47:28,225
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

794
01:47:28,364 --> 01:47:31,197
It was my fault. I hit him.

795
01:47:31,333 --> 01:47:35,099
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

796
01:47:39,341 --> 01:47:43,277
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

797
01:47:43,412 --> 01:47:46,404
Sonny, please don't do anything.

798
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:50,041
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

799
01:47:50,186 --> 01:47:53,053
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

800
01:47:57,693 --> 01:48:00,491
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

801
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:04,329
Tell them to stop taking in action.

802
01:48:04,466 --> 01:48:06,263
We lost enough money last week.

803
01:48:13,342 --> 01:48:14,900
Come here, come here!

804
01:49:12,268 --> 01:49:15,635
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

805
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:13,035
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

806
01:53:13,175 --> 01:53:17,509
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

807
01:53:17,646 --> 01:53:21,412
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

808
01:53:21,550 --> 01:53:24,075
All we know is that he's all right.

809
01:53:26,655 --> 01:53:30,352
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

810
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:36,730
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

811
01:53:36,865 --> 01:53:42,701
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

812
01:53:42,838 --> 01:53:44,897
He'll get in touch with you.

813
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,840
I let my cab go, so can I call
another one, please?

814
01:53:48,977 --> 01:53:50,842
Come on. Sorry.

815
01:54:07,829 --> 01:54:13,426
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

816
01:54:13,569 --> 01:54:15,901
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

817
01:54:16,038 --> 01:54:19,769
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

818
01:54:25,247 --> 01:54:26,509
Bitch!

819
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:31,141
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

820
01:54:31,286 --> 01:54:34,551
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

821
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:37,750
You just told me to make you dinner!

822
01:54:45,467 --> 01:54:48,265
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

823
01:54:52,574 --> 01:54:56,943
That's it, break it all, you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

824
01:55:06,121 --> 01:55:10,387
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

825
01:55:10,525 --> 01:55:12,186
Maybe I will.

826
01:55:18,533 --> 01:55:21,730
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

827
01:55:21,803 --> 01:55:25,967
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

828
01:55:26,108 --> 01:55:29,976
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

829
01:55:32,714 --> 01:55:35,683
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

830
01:55:38,553 --> 01:55:40,145
Clean it!

831
01:55:40,289 --> 01:55:44,589
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

832
01:55:44,726 --> 01:55:46,819
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

833
01:55:46,962 --> 01:55:49,760
Come on, kill me!

834
01:55:51,466 --> 01:55:53,024
Get out of here!

835
01:55:53,168 --> 01:55:56,535
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

836
01:55:56,672 --> 01:55:59,903
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

837
01:56:09,885 --> 01:56:13,013
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

838
01:56:14,022 --> 01:56:16,957
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

839
01:56:17,092 --> 01:56:20,027
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

840
01:56:21,263 --> 01:56:23,026
Yeah, Connie.

841
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:30,502
You wait there.

842
01:56:32,474 --> 01:56:35,307
No, you just wait there.

843
01:56:37,179 --> 01:56:39,739
Son-of-a-bitch.

844
01:56:39,881 --> 01:56:43,248
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

845
01:56:46,688 --> 01:56:49,953
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

846
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:58,959
Sonny!

847
01:57:05,807 --> 01:57:08,605
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

848
01:57:08,744 --> 01:57:10,735
Go after him, go on!

849
01:57:40,208 --> 01:57:42,574
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

850
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:33,383
Give me a drop.

851
01:59:41,229 --> 01:59:43,789
My wife is crying upstairs.

852
01:59:45,934 --> 01:59:48,664
I hear cars coming to the house.

853
01:59:52,941 --> 01:59:56,104
Consigliere of mine,

854
01:59:56,244 --> 01:59:59,475
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

855
01:59:59,614 --> 02:00:01,980
I didn't tell Mama anything.

856
02:00:03,084 --> 02:00:06,815
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

857
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:11,884
But you needed a drink first.

858
02:00:14,596 --> 02:00:15,824
Yeah.

859
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:21,291
Well, now you've had your drink.

860
02:00:26,875 --> 02:00:31,244
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

861
02:00:48,363 --> 02:00:51,298
I want no inquiries made.

862
02:00:55,003 --> 02:00:57,528
I want no acts of vengeance.

863
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,873
I want you to arrange a meeting...

864
02:01:02,944 --> 02:01:05,913
...with the heads of the five families.

865
02:01:07,549 --> 02:01:09,915
This war stops now.

866
02:01:31,539 --> 02:01:34,007
Call Bonasera.

867
02:01:34,142 --> 02:01:36,303
I need him now.

868
02:01:48,523 --> 02:01:53,620
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

869
02:01:53,762 --> 02:01:56,094
You owe your Don a service.

870
02:01:56,231 --> 02:01:59,860
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

871
02:02:00,001 --> 02:02:04,529
He will be at your funeral parlour
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

872
02:02:25,493 --> 02:02:30,260
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

873
02:02:30,398 --> 02:02:33,890
Yes. What do you want me to do?

874
02:02:41,876 --> 02:02:46,711
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

875
02:02:50,585 --> 02:02:53,679
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

876
02:03:09,604 --> 02:03:12,698
Look how they massacred my boy.

877
02:03:42,937 --> 02:03:45,098
It's safer to teach you English!

878
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:46,639
I know English...

879
02:03:46,775 --> 02:03:52,270
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

880
02:03:59,621 --> 02:04:01,953
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

881
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:04,752
How are things in Palermo?

882
02:04:09,864 --> 02:04:16,099
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

883
02:04:16,237 --> 02:04:18,899
How are things in Palermo?

884
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:22,032
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

885
02:04:22,177 --> 02:04:25,203
times are changing for the worse.

886
02:04:27,081 --> 02:04:34,351
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

887
02:04:34,489 --> 02:04:41,588
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

888
02:04:45,166 --> 02:04:47,828
What's wrong?

889
02:04:47,969 --> 02:04:51,700
Bad news from America.

890
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:56,743
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

891
02:05:01,783 --> 02:05:05,241
Let's go... you promised.

892
02:05:23,972 --> 02:05:26,702
Get the car.

893
02:05:27,575 --> 02:05:31,568
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

894
02:05:31,713 --> 02:05:35,240
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

895
02:05:35,383 --> 02:05:37,783
Okay, anything you say.

896
02:05:43,625 --> 02:05:46,093
Calo, where is Apollonia?

897
02:05:46,227 --> 02:05:50,357
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

898
02:05:52,033 --> 02:05:54,934
She'll make a good American wife.

899
02:05:55,937 --> 02:05:57,996
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

900
02:06:07,949 --> 02:06:10,281
Fabrizio!

901
02:06:10,418 --> 02:06:12,886
Where are you going?

902
02:06:13,021 --> 02:06:16,548
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

903
02:06:22,096 --> 02:06:23,427
No, Apollonia!

904
02:06:46,754 --> 02:06:52,351
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting,

905
02:06:52,493 --> 02:06:57,658
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

906
02:06:59,267 --> 02:07:02,327
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

907
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:05,803
and from Brooklyn...

908
02:07:07,542 --> 02:07:09,635
...Philip Tattaglia.

909
02:07:11,145 --> 02:07:14,171
And from Staten Island

910
02:07:14,315 --> 02:07:17,478
we have with us Victor Strachi.

911
02:07:17,618 --> 02:07:23,523
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

912
02:07:23,658 --> 02:07:27,389
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

913
02:07:34,002 --> 02:07:37,460
How did things ever get so far?

914
02:07:37,605 --> 02:07:39,232
I don't know.

915
02:07:41,242 --> 02:07:45,178
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

916
02:07:47,715 --> 02:07:51,845
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

917
02:07:53,755 --> 02:07:57,088
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

918
02:07:57,225 --> 02:08:01,218
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

919
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:06,257
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

920
02:08:06,401 --> 02:08:11,737
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

921
02:08:11,873 --> 02:08:15,866
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

922
02:08:16,010 --> 02:08:20,208
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

923
02:08:20,348 --> 02:08:23,215
He refused to share them.

924
02:08:23,351 --> 02:08:27,082
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

925
02:08:27,221 --> 02:08:29,519
All of you know me.

926
02:08:30,525 --> 02:08:35,690
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

927
02:08:37,365 --> 02:08:43,099
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

928
02:08:43,237 --> 02:08:47,071
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

929
02:08:47,208 --> 02:08:53,511
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

930
02:08:53,648 --> 02:08:58,176
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

931
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:02,653
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

932
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:07,784
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

933
02:09:07,929 --> 02:09:10,056
Times have changed.

934
02:09:10,198 --> 02:09:14,931
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

935
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:17,936
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

936
02:09:18,072 --> 02:09:23,476
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

937
02:09:23,611 --> 02:09:28,480
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

938
02:09:29,217 --> 02:09:32,778
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

939
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:35,821
After all, we're not communists.

940
02:09:38,659 --> 02:09:41,685
I also don't believe in drugs.

941
02:09:41,829 --> 02:09:46,493
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

942
02:09:46,634 --> 02:09:49,797
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

943
02:09:49,937 --> 02:09:56,365
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

944
02:09:57,411 --> 02:10:03,179
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

945
02:10:03,851 --> 02:10:08,345
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

946
02:10:08,489 --> 02:10:10,457
That's an infamia.

947
02:10:11,492 --> 02:10:15,451
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

948
02:10:15,596 --> 02:10:18,565
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

949
02:10:25,373 --> 02:10:29,309
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

950
02:10:30,378 --> 02:10:37,307
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

951
02:10:37,451 --> 02:10:41,945
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

952
02:10:42,089 --> 02:10:46,526
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

953
02:10:46,661 --> 02:10:50,324
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

954
02:10:50,464 --> 02:10:53,797
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

955
02:10:53,935 --> 02:10:56,165
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

956
02:10:56,304 --> 02:11:01,970
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

957
02:11:02,109 --> 02:11:04,270
You talk about vengeance.

958
02:11:04,412 --> 02:11:07,643
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

959
02:11:07,782 --> 02:11:10,580
Or my boy to me?

960
02:11:10,718 --> 02:11:13,619
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

961
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:18,824
But I have selfish reasons.

962
02:11:20,895 --> 02:11:24,888
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

963
02:11:26,367 --> 02:11:28,995
...because of this Sollozzo business.

964
02:11:30,705 --> 02:11:34,197
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

965
02:11:34,342 --> 02:11:37,140
Cleared of all these false charges.

966
02:11:38,579 --> 02:11:41,639
But I'm a superstitious man.

967
02:11:41,782 --> 02:11:48,381
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

968
02:11:48,522 --> 02:11:52,083
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

969
02:11:52,226 --> 02:11:54,956
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

970
02:11:56,330 --> 02:11:59,822
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

971
02:12:01,502 --> 02:12:03,834
And that I do not forgive.

972
02:12:06,374 --> 02:12:08,740
But, that aside...

973
02:12:11,846 --> 02:12:14,212
...let me say that I swear...

974
02:12:15,783 --> 02:12:18,911
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

975
02:12:19,053 --> 02:12:23,012
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

976
02:12:48,883 --> 02:12:54,287
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

977
02:12:54,422 --> 02:12:56,947
Mention it. Don't insist.

978
02:12:58,659 --> 02:13:03,562
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

979
02:13:05,266 --> 02:13:10,465
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

980
02:13:13,941 --> 02:13:19,937
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

981
02:13:34,795 --> 02:13:36,888
Come on, Nancy.

982
02:13:38,099 --> 02:13:40,659
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

983
02:13:42,002 --> 02:13:44,061
Okay, all right.

984
02:13:56,951 --> 02:13:58,543
How long have you been back?

985
02:13:59,687 --> 02:14:01,518
I've been back a year.

986
02:14:03,057 --> 02:14:05,719
Longer than that, I think.

987
02:14:07,728 --> 02:14:10,060
It's good to see you, Kay.

988
02:14:21,041 --> 02:14:23,601
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

989
02:14:26,046 --> 02:14:29,106
He's been sick. Very sick.

990
02:14:30,718 --> 02:14:37,089
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

991
02:14:38,492 --> 02:14:42,690
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

992
02:14:42,830 --> 02:14:46,391
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

993
02:14:47,535 --> 02:14:49,901
Like a senator or president.

994
02:14:50,037 --> 02:14:52,437
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

995
02:14:52,573 --> 02:14:55,406
They don't have men killed.

996
02:14:58,579 --> 02:15:00,570
Who's being naive, Kay?

997
02:15:01,849 --> 02:15:06,650
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

998
02:15:07,655 --> 02:15:12,149
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

999
02:15:13,861 --> 02:15:17,820
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1000
02:15:19,266 --> 02:15:23,566
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1001
02:15:23,704 --> 02:15:28,403
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1002
02:15:28,542 --> 02:15:32,000
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1003
02:15:32,146 --> 02:15:36,378
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1004
02:15:37,785 --> 02:15:40,754
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1005
02:15:42,022 --> 02:15:45,981
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

1006
02:15:47,795 --> 02:15:52,425
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

1007
02:15:53,601 --> 02:15:57,093
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1008
02:15:58,439 --> 02:16:01,237
That we have children. Our children.

1009
02:16:02,676 --> 02:16:05,236
Kay, I need you.

1010
02:16:06,914 --> 02:16:09,109
And I love you.

1011
02:16:30,471 --> 02:16:34,237
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1012
02:16:34,375 --> 02:16:37,936
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1013
02:16:38,078 --> 02:16:41,138
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1014
02:16:41,282 --> 02:16:44,581
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1015
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:48,085
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1016
02:16:48,222 --> 02:16:52,283
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1017
02:16:53,427 --> 02:16:55,554
Don Corleone...

1018
02:16:55,696 --> 02:16:59,757
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1019
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:04,337
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1020
02:17:04,939 --> 02:17:07,567
Michael is now head of the family.

1021
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:11,906
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1022
02:17:12,046 --> 02:17:14,344
After we make the move to Nevada

1023
02:17:14,481 --> 02:17:18,884
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1024
02:17:19,019 --> 02:17:23,319
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1025
02:17:23,457 --> 02:17:29,657
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

1026
02:17:29,797 --> 02:17:35,394
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1027
02:17:35,536 --> 02:17:38,403
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

1028
02:17:38,539 --> 02:17:41,440
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1029
02:17:41,575 --> 02:17:45,306
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1030
02:17:49,683 --> 02:17:54,950
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1031
02:17:55,089 --> 02:17:57,182
That's all I can tell you now.

1032
02:17:58,292 --> 02:18:00,692
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1033
02:18:00,828 --> 02:18:04,127
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1034
02:18:04,264 --> 02:18:09,201
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1035
02:18:09,336 --> 02:18:12,703
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1036
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:17,402
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1037
02:18:36,664 --> 02:18:40,293
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1038
02:18:40,434 --> 02:18:43,494
Mike... Why am I out?

1039
02:18:44,972 --> 02:18:47,702
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1040
02:18:48,976 --> 02:18:51,638
Things may get rough with the move.

1041
02:18:52,312 --> 02:18:53,609
Tom.

1042
02:18:58,786 --> 02:19:03,951
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1043
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:09,529
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1044
02:19:09,663 --> 02:19:12,894
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1045
02:19:13,901 --> 02:19:19,669
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1046
02:19:19,807 --> 02:19:23,208
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1047
02:20:12,226 --> 02:20:16,390
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1048
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:21,058
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1049
02:20:21,201 --> 02:20:25,331
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1050
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:27,702
Let me open the door, all right?

1051
02:20:33,947 --> 02:20:39,613
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1052
02:20:39,753 --> 02:20:42,551
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1053
02:20:46,093 --> 02:20:50,189
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1054
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:53,959
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1055
02:20:55,235 --> 02:20:58,762
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1056
02:21:00,174 --> 02:21:04,770
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1057
02:21:04,912 --> 02:21:08,211
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1058
02:21:13,487 --> 02:21:16,479
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1059
02:21:16,890 --> 02:21:18,983
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1060
02:21:20,761 --> 02:21:22,854
Hey, come on! Scram!

1061
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:28,058
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1062
02:21:29,436 --> 02:21:31,267
Sorry.

1063
02:21:31,405 --> 02:21:33,930
I don't know. He's tired.

1064
02:21:40,981 --> 02:21:43,950
What happened to Moe Greene?

1065
02:21:44,084 --> 02:21:48,453
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1066
02:21:48,589 --> 02:21:50,716
Well, give him a call.

1067
02:21:51,825 --> 02:21:55,124
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1068
02:21:55,262 --> 02:21:57,230
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1069
02:21:57,364 --> 02:22:00,891
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1070
02:22:01,034 --> 02:22:04,003
Well, I owe it all to him.

1071
02:22:04,137 --> 02:22:09,268
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

1072
02:22:09,409 --> 02:22:11,343
Mike, what can I do?

1073
02:22:12,579 --> 02:22:18,643
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

1074
02:22:18,785 --> 02:22:24,781
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

1075
02:22:24,925 --> 02:22:30,056
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1076
02:22:30,197 --> 02:22:33,098
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1077
02:22:34,234 --> 02:22:36,566
See, Johnny...

1078
02:22:36,703 --> 02:22:40,901
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1079
02:22:41,041 --> 02:22:44,636
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1080
02:22:47,648 --> 02:22:52,449
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1081
02:22:53,453 --> 02:22:55,546
We're counting on you.

1082
02:22:57,691 --> 02:23:01,559
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

1083
02:23:01,695 --> 02:23:02,992
Good.

1084
02:23:04,464 --> 02:23:09,163
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1085
02:23:09,303 --> 02:23:11,601
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1086
02:23:11,738 --> 02:23:16,766
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1087
02:23:16,910 --> 02:23:20,175
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1088
02:23:23,150 --> 02:23:26,278
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1089
02:23:27,721 --> 02:23:29,416
Buy me out?

1090
02:23:29,523 --> 02:23:34,517
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1091
02:23:35,295 --> 02:23:40,631
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1092
02:23:40,767 --> 02:23:44,066
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1093
02:23:44,204 --> 02:23:48,732
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1094
02:23:53,046 --> 02:23:55,412
You Guineas make me laugh.

1095
02:23:55,549 --> 02:24:00,350
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1096
02:24:01,455 --> 02:24:04,788
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

1097
02:24:04,925 --> 02:24:10,192
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1098
02:24:10,330 --> 02:24:15,597
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

1099
02:24:15,736 --> 02:24:20,139
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1100
02:24:20,273 --> 02:24:24,073
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1101
02:24:24,211 --> 02:24:29,205
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1102
02:24:29,349 --> 02:24:32,079
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1103
02:24:32,986 --> 02:24:37,685
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1104
02:24:37,824 --> 02:24:42,022
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1105
02:24:42,162 --> 02:24:46,861
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1106
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,936
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1107
02:24:51,071 --> 02:24:53,699
You straightened my brother out?

1108
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:58,334
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1109
02:24:58,478 --> 02:25:00,537
What's wrong with you?

1110
02:25:05,218 --> 02:25:08,881
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1111
02:25:09,523 --> 02:25:10,820
Son-of-a-bitch!

1112
02:25:10,957 --> 02:25:16,224
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1113
02:25:16,363 --> 02:25:18,854
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1114
02:25:19,866 --> 02:25:23,358
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1115
02:25:23,503 --> 02:25:28,736
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1116
02:25:28,875 --> 02:25:32,140
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1117
02:25:36,116 --> 02:25:41,315
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1118
02:25:42,923 --> 02:25:44,117
Fredo...

1119
02:25:45,258 --> 02:25:48,193
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1120
02:25:49,529 --> 02:25:53,659
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1121
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:08,379
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1122
02:26:10,050 --> 02:26:15,249
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1123
02:26:22,195 --> 02:26:25,187
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1124
02:26:25,332 --> 02:26:27,459
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1125
02:26:27,601 --> 02:26:30,570
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1126
02:26:30,704 --> 02:26:32,467
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1127
02:26:32,606 --> 02:26:34,836
Let me think about it. Come on.

1128
02:26:43,650 --> 02:26:46,551
Barzini will move against you first.

1129
02:26:46,686 --> 02:26:51,123
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1130
02:26:51,258 --> 02:26:53,453
Guaranteeing your safety.

1131
02:26:54,461 --> 02:26:57,953
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1132
02:27:02,402 --> 02:27:05,803
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1133
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:10,606
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1134
02:27:15,448 --> 02:27:16,938
I don't know.

1135
02:27:18,885 --> 02:27:21,786
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1136
02:27:22,789 --> 02:27:25,986
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1137
02:27:27,494 --> 02:27:32,329
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1138
02:27:32,465 --> 02:27:35,866
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1139
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:39,839
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1140
02:27:41,474 --> 02:27:44,932
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1141
02:27:48,181 --> 02:27:50,547
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1142
02:27:50,684 --> 02:27:53,812
He looks more like you every day.

1143
02:27:56,189 --> 02:28:00,489
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1144
02:28:02,696 --> 02:28:04,891
Read the funny papers.

1145
02:28:11,938 --> 02:28:17,638
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1146
02:28:17,777 --> 02:28:23,545
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1147
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:29,554
What's the matter?

1148
02:28:29,689 --> 02:28:31,748
What's bothering you?

1149
02:28:35,228 --> 02:28:39,790
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1150
02:28:53,179 --> 02:28:57,616
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

1151
02:28:57,751 --> 02:28:59,719
And Fredo...

1152
02:29:02,022 --> 02:29:04,490
Fredo was, well...

1153
02:29:05,992 --> 02:29:09,257
But I never wanted this for you.

1154
02:29:11,097 --> 02:29:16,125
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

1155
02:29:16,269 --> 02:29:20,137
And I refused to be a fool,

1156
02:29:20,273 --> 02:29:24,733
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1157
02:29:26,379 --> 02:29:29,746
I don't apologise. That's my life,
but I thought that...

1158
02:29:31,518 --> 02:29:36,717
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1159
02:29:38,458 --> 02:29:44,021
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1160
02:29:44,164 --> 02:29:47,156
Another pezzo da novanta.

1161
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:48,961
Well...

1162
02:29:52,138 --> 02:29:56,074
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1163
02:29:56,209 --> 02:30:00,168
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1164
02:30:04,551 --> 02:30:08,954
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1165
02:30:09,089 --> 02:30:12,581
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1166
02:30:29,109 --> 02:30:31,873
Can I hold it, please?

1167
02:30:46,292 --> 02:30:50,228
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1168
02:30:50,363 --> 02:30:53,423
Over here, over here.

1169
02:30:55,001 --> 02:30:58,027
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1170
02:31:03,810 --> 02:31:05,243
Antony!

1171
02:31:05,378 --> 02:31:07,073
Come here, come here.

1172
02:31:11,684 --> 02:31:14,346
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1173
02:31:20,493 --> 02:31:23,394
I'll show you something. Come here.

1174
02:31:24,998 --> 02:31:26,863
Stand there.

1175
02:31:30,603 --> 02:31:32,867
Give me an orange!

1176
02:31:50,757 --> 02:31:52,748
That's a new trick.

1177
02:31:53,793 --> 02:31:56,455
You run in there. Run in there.

1178
02:32:09,542 --> 02:32:11,476
Where are you?

1179
02:35:09,022 --> 02:35:11,422
Mike, can I have a minute?

1180
02:35:21,501 --> 02:35:23,833
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1181
02:35:23,970 --> 02:35:26,996
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1182
02:35:28,107 --> 02:35:30,541
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1183
02:35:31,544 --> 02:35:35,742
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1184
02:35:38,418 --> 02:35:41,444
- All right?
- All right.

1185
02:35:58,538 --> 02:36:01,302
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

1186
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:08,276
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1187
02:36:09,782 --> 02:36:11,716
Where I'll be safe.

1188
02:36:23,863 --> 02:36:27,424
I always thought it would be
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1189
02:36:27,567 --> 02:36:31,936
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1190
02:36:33,573 --> 02:36:35,939
But I'm going to wait.

1191
02:36:36,075 --> 02:36:38,236
After the baptism.

1192
02:36:40,379 --> 02:36:43,075
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1193
02:36:44,283 --> 02:36:47,309
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

1194
02:36:47,453 --> 02:36:52,288
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

1195
02:39:13,666 --> 02:39:18,467
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1196
02:39:18,604 --> 02:39:19,696
I do.

1197
02:39:19,839 --> 02:39:23,434
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1198
02:39:23,576 --> 02:39:24,668
I do.

1199
02:39:24,810 --> 02:39:28,871
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1200
02:39:29,015 --> 02:39:30,243
I do.

1201
02:40:35,748 --> 02:40:40,117
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1202
02:40:46,192 --> 02:40:47,682
I do renounce him.

1203
02:40:57,269 --> 02:40:58,793
And all his works?

1204
02:41:12,585 --> 02:41:13,677
I do renounce them.

1205
02:41:15,421 --> 02:41:16,615
Oh, God!

1206
02:41:19,392 --> 02:41:23,351
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1207
02:41:38,744 --> 02:41:43,113
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

1208
02:41:43,249 --> 02:41:44,477
I will.

1209
02:41:51,757 --> 02:41:57,696
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

1210
02:42:11,310 --> 02:42:13,210
Kay!

1211
02:42:13,345 --> 02:42:15,438
Kiss your godfather.

1212
02:42:39,672 --> 02:42:45,440
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

1213
02:42:45,578 --> 02:42:49,036
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1214
02:42:49,181 --> 02:42:52,378
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1215
02:42:53,686 --> 02:42:56,052
I'll only be a couple of days.

1216
02:43:12,037 --> 02:43:14,232
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1217
02:43:16,308 --> 02:43:20,506
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1218
02:43:27,853 --> 02:43:33,291
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1219
02:43:33,425 --> 02:43:36,883
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1220
02:43:37,029 --> 02:43:39,190
I can't go either, Sal.

1221
02:43:51,143 --> 02:43:55,842
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1222
02:43:56,782 --> 02:43:59,751
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1223
02:44:05,624 --> 02:44:08,092
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1224
02:44:09,195 --> 02:44:12,494
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1225
02:44:57,910 --> 02:45:00,276
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1226
02:45:05,417 --> 02:45:09,319
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1227
02:45:10,522 --> 02:45:14,253
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1228
02:45:14,393 --> 02:45:19,626
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1229
02:45:19,765 --> 02:45:23,098
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1230
02:45:25,137 --> 02:45:27,605
Don't do this to me, please.

1231
02:45:36,649 --> 02:45:38,708
Barzini is dead.

1232
02:45:40,386 --> 02:45:42,718
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1233
02:45:44,023 --> 02:45:45,490
Moe Greene.

1234
02:45:46,458 --> 02:45:50,895
Strachi. Cuneo.

1235
02:45:52,131 --> 02:45:56,568
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1236
02:45:57,569 --> 02:45:59,730
Admit what you did.

1237
02:46:03,175 --> 02:46:05,200
Get him a drink.

1238
02:46:11,317 --> 02:46:12,477
Come on.

1239
02:46:13,786 --> 02:46:18,689
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1240
02:46:20,292 --> 02:46:23,227
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1241
02:46:29,935 --> 02:46:32,301
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1242
02:46:36,875 --> 02:46:40,709
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1243
02:46:41,747 --> 02:46:45,649
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1244
02:46:45,784 --> 02:46:47,411
Tom.

1245
02:46:51,490 --> 02:46:55,119
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1246
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,195
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1247
02:46:59,164 --> 02:47:03,828
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1248
02:47:07,639 --> 02:47:09,698
Who approached you?

1249
02:47:10,909 --> 02:47:13,400
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1250
02:47:21,053 --> 02:47:23,817
It was Barzini.

1251
02:47:26,925 --> 02:47:28,517
Good.

1252
02:47:34,666 --> 02:47:38,659
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1253
02:47:38,804 --> 02:47:42,001
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

1254
02:47:46,712 --> 02:47:49,510
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1255
02:48:15,374 --> 02:48:17,035
Hello, Carlo.

1256
02:49:16,602 --> 02:49:19,969
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1257
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:30,373
Michael!

1258
02:49:30,516 --> 02:49:33,508
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1259
02:49:35,020 --> 02:49:40,014
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1260
02:49:40,158 --> 02:49:44,219
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1261
02:49:44,363 --> 02:49:47,332
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1262
02:49:47,466 --> 02:49:53,268
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1263
02:49:53,405 --> 02:49:55,168
Connie.

1264
02:49:57,342 --> 02:50:02,803
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

1265
02:50:02,948 --> 02:50:08,250
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1266
02:50:08,387 --> 02:50:12,380
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1267
02:50:12,524 --> 02:50:16,187
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1268
02:50:25,103 --> 02:50:28,664
No! No, no...

1269
02:50:29,274 --> 02:50:32,675
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1270
02:50:53,732 --> 02:50:55,461
She's hysterical.

1271
02:51:00,205 --> 02:51:01,900
Hysterical.

1272
02:51:03,709 --> 02:51:04,971
Michael, is it true?

1273
02:51:07,512 --> 02:51:11,107
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1274
02:51:11,249 --> 02:51:14,480
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1275
02:51:34,206 --> 02:51:35,696
All right.

1276
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:40,401
This one time.

1277
02:51:44,182 --> 02:51:46,776
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

1278
02:51:53,692 --> 02:51:54,818
Is it true?

1279
02:51:59,231 --> 02:52:00,789
Is it?

1280
02:52:02,367 --> 02:52:03,800
No.

1281
02:52:17,416 --> 02:52:21,045
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1282
02:52:51,817 --> 02:52:53,682
Don Corleone.
