4
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:18,532
我相信美国

5
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,465
I believe in America.

6
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:21,831
美国使我发了财

7
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,536
America has made my fortune.

8
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:26,732
And I raised my daughter in the American fashion.

9
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:25,535
而我以美国方式教养我的女儿

10
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:28,866
我给她自由

11
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:31,608
I gave her freedom, but I taught her never to dishonour her family.

12
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,843
但也告诉她永远不要有辱家门

13
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:36,141
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

14
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:36,140
她交了位男友但不是意大利人

15
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:40,779
She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late.

16
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:40,481
她跟他去看电影，深夜才回家

17
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,914
我并没有责骂她

18
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:42,618
I didn't protest.

19
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,651
两个月前他与另一个男孩

20
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:48,358
Two months ago he took her for a drive with another boyfriend.

21
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:48,557
带她去兜风

22
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:52,026
They made her drink whiskey

23
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:51,592
他们强灌她喝威士忌

24
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:56,001
然后他们想要占她便宜

25
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:56,399
and then they tried to take advantage of her.

26
00:01:56,538 --> 00:02:00,838
She resisted, she kept her honour.

27
00:01:56,604 --> 00:02:00,938
她抵抗，她保住了名节

28
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:05,412
于是他们像对动物般的毒打她

29
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:05,743
So they beat her like an animal.

30
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:11,818
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken,

31
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,812
当我到医院时

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,175
她的鼻梁断了

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,911
她的下巴被打碎了

34
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:16,687
her jaw was shattered, held together by wire.

35
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,752
必须用钢丝绑着才不会掉下来

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,961
She couldn't even weep because of the pain.

37
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:21,756
她痛得不能哭

38
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:27,627
But I wept. Why did I weep?

39
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,933
但我却哭了，我为什么哭呢？

40
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:32,970
She was the light of my life.

41
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:33,105
我视她如珠如宝

42
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:36,272
Beautiful girl.

43
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:36,269
长得很美丽

44
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,950
Now she will never be beautiful again.

45
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:42,676
现在她再也美丽不起来

46
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,549
Sorry.

47
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:50,782
不好意思

48
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:03,730
I went to the police, like a good American.

49
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,192
我…像个守法的美国人一样

50
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:03,132
我去报警

51
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:06,534
These two boys were brought to trial.

52
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,169
那两个男孩受到了审判

53
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:12,579
法官判他们有期徒刑三年 但缓刑

54
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:12,706
The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, but suspended the sentence.

55
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:19,084
Suspended the sentence! They went free that very day!

56
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,214
缓刑！

57
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:19,349
他们当天就没事了！

58
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:24,354
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

59
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:24,114
我像个傻瓜似的站在法庭中

60
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:28,224
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

61
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:28,187
而那两个混蛋竟朝着我笑

62
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:35,225
Then I said to my wife, "For justice, we must go to Don Corleone."

63
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:30,764
于是我对我太太说

64
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:35,461
为求公道 我们必须去找柯里昂阁下

65
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:43,677
你去报警前为何不先来找我？

66
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:44,542
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,778
What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do.

68
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:46,337
你要我怎么样？

69
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:50,209
你尽管吩咐 但求你一定要帮我这个忙

70
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,580
What is that?

71
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,247
帮你什么忙？

72
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:05,363
I want them dead.

73
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:18,543
That I cannot do.

74
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:18,712
那个我办不到

75
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:22,773
I'll give you anything you ask.

76
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,781
你要什么，我都会给你

77
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,683
I've known you many years, but this is the first time you've asked for help.

78
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,847
我们相识多年

79
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:30,422
这是你第一次来找我帮忙

80
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:37,029
I can't remember the last time you invited me for a cup of coffee.

81
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,594
我记不起你上次是何时 请我到你家去喝咖啡了

82
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,797
Even though my wife is godmother to your only child.

83
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:41,329
何况我太太 还是你独生女的教母

84
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:46,874
But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship.

85
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:44,004
我坦白说吧！

86
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,263
你从来就不想要我的友谊

87
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,740
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

88
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:50,771
而且你怕欠我人情

89
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,313
I didn't want to get into trouble.

90
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,173
我不想卷入是非

91
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,180
I understand.

92
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:55,882
我了解

93
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,220
You found Paradise in America.

94
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,945
你在美国发了财

95
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:07,325
You made a good living, had police protection and there were courts of law.

96
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:04,351
生意做的很好，生活过的很好

97
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:07,428
有警察和法律保护你

98
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:10,158
You didn't need a friend like me.

99
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,621
你不需要我这种朋友

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,292
But now you come to me and say,

101
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,198
但是…

102
00:05:13,368 --> 00:05:15,165
现在你来找我说

103
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,738
柯里昂阁下，请帮我主持公道

104
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,270
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

105
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:22,542
But you don't ask with respect.

106
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:22,038
但你对我一点尊重也没有

107
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:28,116
You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather.

108
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,609
你并不把我当朋友

109
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:27,744
你甚至不愿意喊我教父

110
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:36,057
You come on my daughter's wedding day and ask me to murder for money.

111
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:32,583
你在我女儿结婚当天来我家

112
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:35,780
用钱收买我为你杀人

113
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,424
我只是要求你主持公道

114
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,682
I ask you for justice.

115
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:41,591
那不是公道，你女儿还活着

116
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:41,625
That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.

117
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,599
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

118
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:46,564
那么让他们像她一样受折磨

119
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:49,861
我应该付你多少钱？

120
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,601
How much shall I pay you?

121
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,777
包纳萨拉

122
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,223
Bonasera, Bonasera.

123
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:08,950
包纳萨拉

124
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:10,454
到底我做了什么

125
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:13,418
What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?

126
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:13,118
让你这么的不尊重我

127
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:17,057
If you'd come in friendship,

128
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:16,689
如果你以朋友身分来找我

129
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,602
the scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.

130
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:21,531
那么伤害你女儿的杂碎 就会受到折磨

131
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:28,040
And if an honest man like you should make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

132
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,499
你这种诚实人的敌人

133
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,200
也就是我的敌人

134
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,712
And then they would fear you.

135
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:33,072
那么，他们就会怕你

136
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,345
Be my friend?

137
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:38,650
当我的朋友？

138
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,284
Godfather?

139
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:44,755
教父

140
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:50,391
Good.

141
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,354
很好

142
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:57,633
Some day, and that day may never come, I'll ask a service of you.

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,627
他日我或需要你的帮忙

144
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:57,102
也可能不会有那么一天

145
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,201
But until that day...

146
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:01,769
但在那一天到来之前

147
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:07,144
...accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.

148
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:06,277
收下这份公道 做为小女结婚之礼

149
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:09,842
- Grazie, Godfather. - Prego.

150
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:09,714
-谢谢，教父 -别客气

151
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,987
这件事交给…克里曼沙

152
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:19,794
Give this to Clemenza.

153
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,322
I want people that aren't going to get carried away.

154
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:25,355
我要用可靠的人 头脑清醒的人

155
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:29,631
We're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker says.

156
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,493
我们不是谋杀犯，下手别太重

157
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:58,299
- Where's Michael? - Don't worry, he'll be here.

158
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:57,760
-麦克在哪？ -别担心，他一会就来

159
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,699
没有麦克我不照相

160
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,231
We're not taking the picture without Michael.

161
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:06,265
待会再拍

162
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,574
- What's the matter? - It's Michael.

163
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,707
-什么事？ -麦克的事

164
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:02,623
Don Barzini.

165
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,495
你好，巴西尼阁下

166
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,065
你认得我儿子吧？

167
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,013
保利，让我喝点酒

168
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,308
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

169
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,784
保利，再来点酒

170
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,680
Paulie! More wine.

171
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:31,792
- You look terrific on the floor. - Are you a dance judge or something?

172
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,718
-你看起来棒极了 -你是裁判还是什么？

173
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:33,959
闪开吧，到附近晃晃 做你的工作

174
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,986
Take a walk and do your job.

175
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,035
Sandra, watch the kids. Don't let them run wild.

176
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:44,669
仙杜拉，帮个忙 别让孩子乱跑，好吗？

177
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,773
你看好你自己，好吗？

178
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:48,108
You watch yourself, all right?

179
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:12,958
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

180
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,230
两三万元小钞，全是现金

181
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,062
In that little silk purse.

182
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,231
全在那个小丝袋里

183
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:19,970
If this were somebody else's wedding... Sfortunato!

184
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,962
如果这是我的婚礼我就发财了

185
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:22,508
Hey, Paulie!

186
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:24,601
保利，接住吧！

187
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,474
Stupid jerk!

188
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:26,638
你这个笨蛋！

189
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,424
What's the matter?

190
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:36,750
怎么回事？

191
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,204
- Have to go back to work. - Tom.

192
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:52,168
-我得回去工作了 -汤姆

193
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:53,365
这是婚礼的一部分

194
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,572
No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day.

195
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,307
没有西西里人在女儿结婚那天 能拒绝任何的请求

196
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:07,419
柯里昂阁下 能受邀到贵府深感荣幸

197
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:07,448
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and grateful that you have invited me.

198
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:13,227
你们在干什么？滚！

199
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,557
Get out of here! It's a private party. Go on!

200
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,255
这是私人宴会，快滚

201
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:19,533
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

202
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,326
这算什么？是我妹妹的婚礼

203
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:29,406
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

204
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,801
该死的联邦密探什么都不尊重

205
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,440
Come here, come here, come here!

206
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:35,507
过来这！…

207
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,960
...but towards the end, he was paroled to help with the American war effort,

208
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:53,925
但最后他获假释去为美国作战

209
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:56,629
过去六个月 他在我的糕饼店做事

210
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:57,128
so for six months he's worked in my pastry shop.

211
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:59,968
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

212
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,466
纳色利，我的朋友 我能为你做什么？

213
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,804
现在战争结束了

214
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,042
Now that the war is over,

215
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,410
这男孩，安索 他们要把他遣返意大利

216
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:06,079
this boy, Enzo, they want to repatriate him back to Italy.

217
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:11,242
Godfather, I have a daughter. You see, she and Enzo...

218
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:11,514
教父，我有个女儿 她和安索…

219
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,814
You want Enzo to stay in this country, and your daughter to be married.

220
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,356
你要安索留在这个国家 和你女儿成亲

221
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,450
你什么都了解，谢谢

222
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,223
You understand everything.

223
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,495
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

224
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:23,662
哈金先生，谢谢

225
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:29,432
待会看看我为你女儿 做的结婚蛋糕

226
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:30,566
Wait till you see the wedding cake I made for your daughter!

227
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:32,834
这么高…还有一对新人和天使

228
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:33,469
The bride, the groom and the angel...

229
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:43,140
- Who should I give this job to? - Not to our paisa.

230
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,474
这件事我该交给谁去办？

231
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:42,275
别给我们这个选区

232
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:48,586
Give it to a Jew Congressman in another district. Who else is on the list?

233
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:46,318
给别地区的犹太籍众议员

234
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:48,718
名单上还有谁？

235
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,029
你好！麦克！

236
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:57,189
Hey, Michael!

237
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:20,387
He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

238
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,748
路卡布拉西不在名单上 但他想要见你

239
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:28,493
Is this necessary?

240
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,728
这个…有这个必要吗？

241
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,192
He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

242
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:31,957
他没料到会受邀参加婚礼 所以要向你致谢

243
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:33,898
好吧

244
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:39,869
柯里昂阁下，在令媛婚礼这天

245
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:40,266
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and grateful that you have invited me

246
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,367
能受邀到贵府深感荣幸

247
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:45,641
on the wedding day of your daughter. May their first child be a masculine child.

248
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,706
希望他们早生贵子

249
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:47,976
麦克！

250
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:48,147
Michael...

251
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:52,250
那边的那个人在自言自语

252
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,114
That man over there is talking to himself.

253
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:56,314
See that scary guy over there?

254
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,788
看到那边 那个吓人的砘锪寺穑

255
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:59,893
- He's a very scary guy. - What's his name?

256
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,618
-他很叫人害怕 -他是谁？叫什么名字？

257
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:04,465
His name is Luca Brasi. He helps my father out sometimes.

258
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:04,725
他叫做路卡布拉西 有时候替家父办事

259
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,734
Michael, he's coming over here!

260
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,232
麦克！等一下，他过来了

261
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:09,666
麦克！

262
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:12,570
汤姆！

263
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,406
You look terrific!

264
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:15,074
你气色好极了！

265
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,477
家兄汤姆哈金，这是凯亚当斯

266
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,808
My brother Tom Hagen, Miss Kay Adams.

267
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,976
-你好 -你好

268
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:22,215
你父亲要见你

269
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,746
Your father's been asking for you.

270
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:25,717
- Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

271
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:24,741
-幸会！ -幸会

272
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:30,150
Why does your brother have a different name?

273
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,680
若他是你哥哥，为何不同姓？

274
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:35,695
小时候在街上 发现汤姆无家可归

275
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,954
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen in the street.

276
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:38,691
He had no home, so my father took him in.

277
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:38,259
所以家父收养了他

278
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:42,835
He's been with us ever since.

279
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,559
从此他就和我们住在一起了

280
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:44,939
He's a good lawyer.

281
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,432
他是个好律师

282
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,140
不是西西里人 但我想他会当军师

283
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,434
Not a Sicilian. I think he's going to be consigliere.

284
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,479
- What's that? - That's a...

285
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,703
-那是什么？ -那是…

286
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:57,244
...like a counsellor, an advisor. Very important for the family.

287
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:56,741
像是个顾问 在家族中的地位非常重要

288
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,480
You like your lasagne?

289
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:00,250
你的扁形通心面还好吧？

290
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:06,258
柯里昂阁下

291
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:06,987
Don Corleone.

292
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:11,030
在令媛的婚礼受到邀请

293
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:09,619
I'm honoured and grateful

294
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:13,723
that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding.

295
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:14,067
深感荣幸与感激

296
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,834
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

297
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:21,264
在令媛结婚的当天

298
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:27,209
And I hope that their first child will be a masculine child.

299
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:27,412
我希望他们能早生贵子

300
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:33,720
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

301
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:34,515
这是我一点小小的心意

302
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:38,391
-祝福他们俩白头偕老 -谢谢你，路卡

303
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,383
- For your daughter's bridal purse. - Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

304
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,426
我最珍贵的朋友

305
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:46,026
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you now, because I know you're busy.

306
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:45,956
柯里昂阁下，我晓得你忙 我先告退了

307
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:47,966
Thank you.

308
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:47,826
谢谢

309
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,917
Signora Corleone!

310
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,251
柯里昂夫人

311
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,113
No!

312
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:44,818
不！…

313
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:57,955
Senator Cauley apologised for not coming, but said you'd understand.

314
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,551
科利参议员对不能亲自来致歉

315
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:56,957
他说你会谅解的

316
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:02,331
Also some of the judges. They've all sent gifts.

317
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:02,295
还有一些法官也一样 他们都送了礼物

318
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:04,826
敬你！

319
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:06,670
What is that outside?

320
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:06,734
外面是怎么回事？

321
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:20,149
强尼！…

322
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,685
Johnny! Johnny!

323
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:22,983
I love you!

324
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,016
我爱你！

325
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,535
他大老远由加州赶来参加婚礼

326
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:36,661
He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come!

327
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:36,693
我告诉过你他会来的

328
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,795
已经两年了，他也许又有麻烦

329
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:40,296
- He's probably in trouble again. - He's a good godson.

330
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:40,168
他是个好教子

331
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:45,806
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

332
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:45,971
强尼！…唱首歌

333
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:04,029
You never said you knew Johnny Fontane!

334
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:03,991
麦克！你从未告诉我 你认得强尼方亭

335
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:07,998
-你想见他吗？ -当然！

336
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:08,101
- Sure. You want to meet him? - Great! Sure.

337
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:12,138
- My father helped him with his career. - He did?

338
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:11,394
-家父帮他建立他的事业 -真的？

339
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:13,365
How?

340
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:13,330
怎么做的？

341
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:17,776
- Let's listen to this song. - Michael...

342
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:17,501
-我们先听这首唱 -不，麦克

343
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,040
Please, Michael. Tell me.

344
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:54,107
拜托，麦克！告诉我

345
00:19:57,852 --> 00:20:02,687
When Johnny was starting out, he was signed to a personal service contract

346
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:04,118
强尼刚出道时 和一个乐队领班签了合约

347
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,656
with a big bandleader.

348
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:09,287
当他走红后，想要解除合约

349
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:10,924
And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it.

350
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:13,226
强尼是家父的教子

351
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:13,556
Johnny is my father's godson.

352
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:17,137
My father went to see this bandleader.

353
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:16,761
于是家父去见乐队负责人

354
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:21,105
He offered him 10,000 dollars to let Johnny go,

355
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:20,067
而且出一万元要他与强尼解约

356
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,904
but the bandleader said no.

357
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,036
他说不行！

358
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:29,415
So the next day my father went to see him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

359
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:29,616
第二天家父再去见他 只是这次带着路卡布拉西

360
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:33,513
Within an hour,

361
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:32,884
一个小时之内

362
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:39,422
he signed a release for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

363
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:39,454
他签了解约书 只收了一千元的支票

364
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:44,828
- How did he do that? - Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

365
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:42,254
他是怎么办到的？

366
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,125
家父提了个他不能拒绝的条件

367
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:47,829
那是什么？

368
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:51,536
- What was that? - Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

369
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:51,235
路卡布拉西用枪顶着他的头

370
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:56,609
他要是不签字脑袋就会开花

371
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:56,905
and father said that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.

372
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,611
That's a true story.

373
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,380
这是真实的故事

374
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:17,626
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

375
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:17,792
凯，那是我的家庭，不是我

376
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,873
Beautiful!

377
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:05,542
我会处理的

378
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,213
I'll take care of it.

379
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,372
汤姆！

380
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,212
Tom...

381
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,944
I want you to find Santino. Tell him to come to the office.

382
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:11,583
叫山提诺来我的办公室

383
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,161
How are you, Fredo?

384
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,826
你好吗？弗雷多

385
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:24,627
-家兄弗雷多 -这位是凯亚当斯

386
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,890
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

387
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,401
- Hi. - How are you doing?

388
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,864
-你好 -你好吗？

389
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:34,674
- This is my brother Mike. - Are you having a good time?

390
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:32,872
-这是舍弟麦克 -玩的愉快吗？

391
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,277
Yeah. This is your friend?

392
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,274
这是你的朋友？

393
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:42,781
I don't know what to do. My voice is weak. It's weak.

394
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:39,370
我不知道该怎么办

395
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:42,447
我的嗓子很虚弱，很虚弱

396
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:50,187
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture, it puts me right back on top again.

397
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:47,352
总之我若能得到那部戏的角色

398
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:49,882
我会再次走红的

399
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:55,728
But this... man won't give it to me, the head of the studio.

400
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,689
但是电影公司的老板不让我演

401
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:58,730
-他叫什么名字？ -华尔斯

402
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:58,957
- What's his name? - Woltz.

403
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,537
He won't give it to me, and he says there's no chance.

404
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:03,626
他不肯让我演 而且还说门都没有

405
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:08,772
Sonny?

406
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,800
山尼？

407
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:11,503
Sonny?

408
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:11,701
山尼？

409
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,211
Sonny?

410
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,240
山尼？

411
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:22,815
- Sonny, are you in there? - What?

412
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,551
山尼？你在里面吗？

413
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:23,078
什么事？

414
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:24,481
The old man wants you.

415
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:24,453
老头子要见你

416
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:27,753
好，马上去

417
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,855
One minute.

418
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,667
山尼

419
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,337
一个月以前

420
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:47,212
A month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best-seller.

421
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,570
他买下这本畅销书的电影版权

422
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,806
The main character is a guy just like me.

423
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:50,541
男主角就像是我的写照

424
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:53,752
我根本不需要演 只要当我自己即可

425
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:53,613
I wouldn't even have to act.

426
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:57,787
但…教父，我不知该怎么办？

427
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,589
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

428
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,885
你要表现得像个男人！

429
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:03,126
You can act like a man! What's the matter with you?

430
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:02,291
你是怎么回事？

431
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,357
这就是你在好莱坞学到的？

432
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:08,930
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood finocchio, that cries like a woman?

433
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,558
哭的像个女人？

434
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,596
该怎么办？怎么办？

435
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:12,869
"What can I do? What can I do?" What is that nonsense?

436
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:12,967
算什么鬼话？

437
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,838
Ridiculous.

438
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,500
岂有此理！

439
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:22,643
- You spend time with your family? - Sure I do.

440
00:24:19,513 --> 00:24:22,539
-你有花时间与家人共聚吗？ -我当然有

441
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:24,273
Good.

442
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:23,805
很好

443
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:29,685
Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.

444
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:28,181
因为不抽空陪家人的男人 不是真正的男人

445
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:30,048
过来这

446
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:38,231
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

447
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:37,762
你看来糟透了，我要你多吃点

448
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:39,320
好好休息

449
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:43,598
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood big shot will give you what you want.

450
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:43,335
从现在起一个月内 好莱坞大亨会让你愿望成真

451
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:46,900
It's too late, they start shooting in a week.

452
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:46,102
太迟了 他们一周内就要开拍了

453
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:50,169
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.

454
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:49,736
我会给他一个 他无法拒绝的提议

455
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:57,873
现在你到外面去好好的玩

456
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:57,973
Just go outside and enjoy yourself, and forget about all this nonsense.

457
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:03,646
-其他的交给我来办 -好的

458
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:03,514
- I want you to leave it all to me. - All right.

459
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:33,514
- What time does my daughter leave? - Soon, after they cut the cake.

460
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:30,578
我女儿女婿何时离开？

461
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:33,377
切完蛋糕后的几分钟

462
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:37,021
Do we give your son-in-law something important?

463
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,178
你的新女婿要给重要职务吗？

464
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:42,527
Never. Give him a living, but never discuss the family business with him.

465
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,621
永远不要！

466
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,955
让他们过好日子 但别让他插手家族中的事

467
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:45,461
- What else? - Virgil Sollozzo called.

468
00:25:42,863 --> 00:25:43,887
还有什么事？

469
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:45,464
威尔斯索拉索来过电话

470
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,036
- We'll have to see him next week. - When you come back from California.

471
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:47,497
下周我们必须安排跟他见面

472
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:50,126
等你从加州回来我们再讨论

473
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:54,839
- When am I going to California? - Tonight.

474
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:53,234
我何时要去加州了？

475
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:54,965
我要你今晚去

476
00:25:54,975 --> 00:26:00,379
I want you to talk to this movie big shot and settle this business for Johnny.

477
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,803
我要你和这个…

478
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:59,872
电影大亨谈谈 把强尼的事摆平

479
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:04,078
若没有其他事 我想去参加我女儿的婚礼了

480
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:05,819
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding.

481
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:10,624
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

482
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:09,847
卡洛，我们要拍照了

483
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,521
Wait a minute.

484
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:12,916
等一下

485
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,594
不，麦克，我不行

486
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:16,061
No, Michael. Not me.

487
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:23,598
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

488
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,833
好了，就是这样，别动！

489
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,816
- You need a little more heat on that arc. - Start talking.

490
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,409
好了，开始说吧！

491
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,214
我是强尼方亭的朋友派来的

492
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,181
I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane.

493
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:21,686
他的朋友是我的委托人

494
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,949
This friend would give his friendship to Mr Woltz,

495
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:23,949
若是华尔斯先生能帮他个小忙

496
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:26,855
他将会感激不尽

497
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,719
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

498
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,158
Woltz is listening.

499
00:28:26,993 --> 00:28:28,255
继续说下去

500
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:33,790
Give Johnny the part in that war film you're starting next week.

501
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:33,059
把你下周开拍的 新片男主角让强尼担任

502
00:28:39,073 --> 00:28:44,101
And what favour would your friend grant Mr Woltz?

503
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:44,099
他的朋友会回报我什么好处？

504
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,645
He could make your future union problems disappear.

505
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:47,575
你若有工会问题 我的委托人能摆平

506
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:51,842
And one of your stars has just moved from marijuana to heroin.

507
00:28:47,814 --> 00:28:50,442
而你旗下一位抽大麻的大牌

508
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,539
现在吸起海洛因了

509
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:52,846
你想要威胁我吗？

510
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:56,251
Are you trying to muscle me? Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

511
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:54,783
绝对没有，我只是…

512
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:56,378
听着 你这个油腔滑调的王八蛋

513
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,793
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny Fontane will never get that movie!

514
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,923
让我对你及你的老板说清楚 不管他是何许人

515
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:01,118
强尼方亭绝对得不到那个角色

516
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:05,558
No matter how many Dago Guinea greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

517
00:29:01,227 --> 00:29:05,493
我不在乎有多少意大利的 移民来找我麻烦

518
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:06,927
我是德裔爱尔兰人

519
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:09,533
- I'm German-Irish. - Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

520
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,535
坦白告诉你，德国朋友

521
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,970
- I'm going to make trouble for you! - I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

522
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:12,069
你大祸临头了 你甚至不会晓得是谁扁你

523
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:14,140
华尔斯先生，我是位律师 我不是来威胁你

524
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:17,475
I know New York's big lawyers. Who are you?

525
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:17,266
我认识纽约的每位大律师 你是谁？

526
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:22,981
I have a special practice. I handle one client. I'll wait for your call.

527
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:20,202
我的执业情况特别 只为一位委托人办事

528
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:23,112
你有我的电话号码 我等你电话

529
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:27,579
告诉你，我很喜欢你的电影

530
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:27,954
By the way, I admire your pictures very much.

531
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:35,093
Check him out.

532
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:33,816
摸清他的底细

533
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,210
- It's really beautiful. - Look at this.

534
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:57,807
真是美极了

535
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:01,253
看看这个 原本是用来装饰王宫的

536
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:03,847
- It used to decorate a king's palace. - Very nice.

537
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:03,714
很漂亮

538
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,357
Why didn't you say you work for Corleone?

539
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,285
你为何不说 你为柯里昂阁下做事

540
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,256
我以为你只是个市井流氓

541
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:10,827
I thought you were some cheap hustler Johnny was running in.

542
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:10,295
是强尼派来勒索我的

543
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:13,057
除非真的必要 否则我不想提起他的名字

544
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:14,127
- I only use his name when necessary. - How's your drink?

545
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,857
-你的酒还好吗？ -很好

546
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:17,669
- Fine. - Now I'll show you something beautiful.

547
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:17,469
到这边来 让你看看真正漂亮的东西

548
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:20,705
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

549
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:19,668
你的眼光应该不错吧？

550
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:26,335
There you are. 600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

551
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:26,071
这里！这匹马价值六十万元

552
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:30,114
我敢说俄国沙皇 也从未在马身上花那么大笔钱

553
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,109
I bet Russian czars never paid that for a single horse.

554
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,774
Khartoum.

555
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:31,914
达通！

556
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:34,048
Khartoum.

557
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:34,217
达通！

558
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:39,824
I'm not going to race him, though. I'm going to put him out to stud.

559
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:40,221
不过我不会用它们来比赛 我要它们当种马

560
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:42,792
Thanks, Tony.

561
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,085
-谢谢，汤尼！ -不必客气！

562
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,130
我们去吃点东西吧！

563
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,690
Let's get something to eat.

564
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:50,098
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

565
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:49,528
柯里昂是强尼的教父

566
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:54,697
To the Italian people that's a very sacred, close relationship.

567
00:30:50,336 --> 00:30:54,796
对意大利人而言 那是种宗教上神圣的亲密关系

568
00:30:54,841 --> 00:31:00,177
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything else. This favour I can't give him.

569
00:30:54,974 --> 00:30:55,998
我很敬重这点

570
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:58,734
告诉他除了这件事

571
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:00,836
我什么都答应

572
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:04,482
He never asks a second favour when he's been refused the first.

573
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:04,480
他被拒绝一次后 不会再要求第二次

574
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:10,648
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

575
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:09,520
你不了解 强尼方亭永远别想演那部电影

576
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:14,557
That part is perfect for him. It'll make him a big star.

577
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:12,448
他很适合那个角色

578
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,183
会让他成为巨星

579
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:16,059
但我要让他走投无路

580
00:31:14,695 --> 00:31:18,461
I'm going to run him out of the business, and let me tell you why.

581
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:18,094
我告诉你为什么

582
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:25,400
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges.

583
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:25,361
强尼毁了一位华尔斯国际公司 最有前途的女星

584
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:30,875
We trained her for five years. Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

585
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:27,731
五年来我们不断地训练她

586
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:30,810
歌唱课、表演课、跳舞课

587
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:33,172
我在她身上投资了无数的金钱

588
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:35,573
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her, to make her a big star.

589
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,406
我要让她成为一位巨星

590
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:38,378
Let me be even more frank.

591
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:38,216
让我更坦白的告诉你

592
00:31:38,451 --> 00:31:43,388
让你知道我不是铁石心肠 也不是势利眼

593
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:43,478
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

594
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:47,185
She was beautiful. She was young and innocent!

595
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:47,284
她年轻漂亮，天真无邪

596
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:52,594
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had and I've had them all over the world.

597
00:31:47,427 --> 00:31:51,454
我拥有她就等于拥有全世界

598
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:58,968
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

599
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,927
然后强尼方亭出现了

600
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:59,061
带着磁性的嗓音 加上意大利的魅力

601
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:00,801
And she runs off.

602
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,831
把她拐走了

603
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:05,703
她跑掉了使我非常难堪

604
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:05,135
She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous!

605
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:11,443
而我这种地位的人 无法忍受难堪

606
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:11,478
And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!

607
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:13,848
你马上给我滚

608
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:13,848
You get the hell out of here!

609
00:32:13,987 --> 00:32:18,356
If that goombah tries any rough stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader.

610
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,784
若是那混球想对我动粗

611
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,858
你告诉他我不是乐队领班

612
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:22,585
Yeah, I heard that story.

613
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:22,820
我听过那个故事了

614
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:27,365
Thank you for dinner and a very pleasant evening.

615
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,521
谢谢你的晚餐款待

616
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:30,231
Maybe your car can take me to the airport.

617
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,727
也许你能派车送我去机场

618
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,136
Mr Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately.

619
00:32:30,537 --> 00:32:33,802
柯里昂先生坚持 坏消息要立刻回报

620
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:30,655
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom? - No, I slept on the plane.

621
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:30,347
-你不会太累吧？汤姆 -我在飞机上睡过了

622
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,760
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

623
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:32,620
我这里有索拉索的资料

624
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:35,156
Now...

625
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,930
众人皆知，索拉索是土耳其人

626
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:42,258
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's supposed to be very good with a knife,

627
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:42,564
他应该善于用刀

628
00:34:42,936 --> 00:34:47,270
but only in matters of business with reasonable complaint.

629
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:46,598
但只有发生利益冲突时 才会使用

630
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:50,376
His business is narcotics.

631
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:49,703
他是做毒品生意的

632
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,946
He has fields in Turkey, where they grow poppy.

633
00:34:50,543 --> 00:34:53,478
他们在土耳其种罂粟

634
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,039
In Sicily he has plants to process them into heroin.

635
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,215
在西西里有工厂提练成海洛因

636
00:34:58,185 --> 00:35:01,621
He needs cash, he needs protection from the police.

637
00:34:58,251 --> 00:34:59,843
他需要现金

638
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:03,682
以及在毒品交易时 需要警方的保护

639
00:35:01,755 --> 00:35:05,691
He'll give a piece of the action. I don't know how much.

640
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:05,653
我无法查出保护费价钱多少

641
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:08,590
在纽约是塔塔基利亚家族 在保护他

642
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:11,025
The Tattaglia family is behind him here. They have to be in it for something.

643
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,388
他们一定也想分占利益

644
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:11,991
山尼柯里昂

645
00:35:12,032 --> 00:35:16,799
- What about his prison record? - One term in Italy, one here.

646
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:15,962
-他的犯罪前科呢？ -一次在意大利，一次在这

647
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:19,405
He's known as a top narcotics man.

648
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:19,369
他是众所周知的大毒枭

649
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:24,977
- Santino, what do you think? - A lot of money in that white powder.

650
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:21,931
山提诺，你认为呢？

651
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:24,733
白粉可以赚大钱

652
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:28,110
Tom?

653
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:32,278
我赞成，毒品比什么都好赚

654
00:35:28,248 --> 00:35:32,412
Yes. There's more money in narcotics than anything else.

655
00:35:32,518 --> 00:35:34,713
就算我们不加入，别人也会

656
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:37,251
If we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe the five families.

657
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,346
也许是五大家族之一 也许全部都会

658
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:41,759
With that money they can buy more police and political power.

659
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:41,687
他们会用毒品赚到的钱 买通警方和政客

660
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:43,988
Then they come after us.

661
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,361
到时就会赶上我们

662
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,330
Now we have unions and gambling, and that's great, but narcotics is the future.

663
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:46,495
现在我们掌握了工会及赌场

664
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:50,526
而他们却掌握未来最好的东西 毒品

665
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,204
If we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything in ten years' time.

666
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:52,160
我们若不能分一杯羹

667
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:53,669
我们可能会失去一切

668
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:56,207
我不是指现在而是在十年之内

669
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,340
So? What's your answer going to be, Pop?

670
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:03,415
你的答案是什么呢？爸爸

671
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,553
Don Corleone.

672
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:10,222
柯里昂阁下

673
00:36:12,024 --> 00:36:14,652
我需要有势力的友人

674
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:15,357
I need a man who has powerful friends.

675
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:17,292
我需要一百万元的现金

676
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:18,089
I need a million dollars in cash.

677
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:24,297
我需要你手中掌握的政客

678
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:24,067
I need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

679
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:29,566
- What is the interest for my family? - 30 per cent.

680
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:29,006
-对我家族有什么利益？ -三成

681
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,611
In the first year your end should be three, four million dollars.

682
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:32,973
第一年你就可进帐三四百万元

683
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:35,008
然后还会增加

684
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:35,874
And then it would go up.

685
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:40,284
And what is the interest for the Tattaglia family?

686
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:39,440
塔塔基利亚家族 会得到什么好处？

687
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:44,347
My compliments.

688
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,684
我的敬意

689
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,355
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

690
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:50,853
我会从我那一份当中分给他们

691
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:55,497
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

692
00:36:51,297 --> 00:36:58,794
我提供财务、政治 和法律的保护，可以分到三成

693
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:59,036
political influence and legal protection?

694
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:00,198
没错

695
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,867
That's right.

696
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:05,910
Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve this generosity?

697
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,371
你为何来找我

698
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:05,943
我为何值得你这么慷慨？

699
00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:10,709
若你能考虑投资一百万元现金

700
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:11,245
If you consider a million dollars in cash just finance,

701
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,580
我就会向你敬礼，柯里昂阁下

702
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:13,716
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

703
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:29,228
I said that I would see you, because I heard you were a serious man,

704
00:37:24,197 --> 00:37:29,260
我肯见你是因为 我听说你是个正直的人

705
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:31,667
to be treated with respect.

706
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:31,300
所以我以礼相待

707
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,742
But, I must say no to you.

708
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:39,876
但是我必须拒绝你

709
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:43,282
And I'll give you my reason.

710
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:42,678
我会告诉你原因

711
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,583
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

712
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:46,581
没错，我是有很多政界的朋友

713
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,584
但若他们知道我在搞毒品生意 而不再是赌博时

714
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:52,154
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was involved in drugs instead of gambling,

715
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:52,383
他们就不再是我的朋友

716
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:57,958
which they regard as a harmless vice, but drugs is a dirty business.

717
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:55,950
他们认为赌博 只是些无伤大雅的事业

718
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:57,117
但毒品是败坏德性的生意

719
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,824
-但是柯里昂阁下… -对我而言一个人以何为生

720
00:37:58,098 --> 00:38:02,967
It doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living.

721
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:02,400
并没有什么差别

722
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:08,370
But your business is... a little dangerous.

723
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:08,163
但你这种生意…有一点危险性

724
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:10,909
若你还是担心安全的问题

725
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:12,569
If you're worried about security, the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

726
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:12,836
塔塔基利亚会做保证的

727
00:38:12,979 --> 00:38:16,471
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our... - Wait a minute.

728
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:15,411
你是说塔塔基利亚家族 会保证我们的投资…

729
00:38:15,581 --> 00:38:16,775
等一下

730
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:28,090
你看我把孩子都给宠坏了

731
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:28,319
I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I spoil them.

732
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:30,452
他们说话非常没有分寸

733
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:32,124
They talk when they should listen. But anyway...

734
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:33,097
但总之，索拉索先生

735
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:37,532
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to congratulate you on your new business.

736
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,291
我的决定还是不行

737
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:37,493
我要恭喜你的生意

738
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:40,834
我知道你会很成功… 我祝你好运

739
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:40,970
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

740
00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:44,634
尤其是你的生意 不会与我的冲突

741
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:46,170
Especially since your interests don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

742
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:46,503
谢谢

743
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:08,328
Santino.

744
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:07,723
山提诺

745
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:10,436
Come here.

746
00:39:08,534 --> 00:39:09,831
到这来

747
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:14,071
你是怎么回事？

748
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:19,202
What's the matter with you? Your brain is going soft from playing with that girl.

749
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,074
我看你和女孩子胡搞之后 脑子退化了

750
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:23,748
Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again.

751
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:23,039
别让外人知道你在想什么

752
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,009
走吧

753
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,180
Go on.

754
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:32,616
汤姆，这是什么乱七八糟的？

755
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:32,718
Tom, what's this nonsense?

756
00:39:32,725 --> 00:39:35,785
那是强尼送的 他主演了那部新电影

757
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,625
It's from Johnny. He's starring in that new film.

758
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:39,588
好了，把它拿走

759
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:41,495
- Take it away. - Take it over there.

760
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,397
把它放到那去

761
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:44,226
And...

762
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:43,962
还有

763
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:47,639
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

764
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:47,228
叫路卡布拉西到这来

765
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:56,846
I'm a little worried about this Sollozzo fellow.

766
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:56,479
我对这索拉索有点担心

767
00:39:56,983 --> 00:39:59,713
Find out what he's got under his fingernails.

768
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:59,917
我要你弄清楚他在耍什么把戏

769
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:04,320
到塔塔基利亚那边去

770
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,547
Go to the Tattaglias.

771
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,354
让他们以为你 与我们家族不融洽

772
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:10,152
Make them think that you're not too happy with our family

773
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,594
尽量查

774
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:12,821
and find out what you can.

775
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:33,447
I got something for your mother and for Sonny

776
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,415
我买了东西给令堂

777
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,751
还有给弗雷多的领带 给汤姆的钢笔

778
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:38,455
and a tie for Freddy, and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

779
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:42,152
-你圣诞节想要什么？ -我只要你

780
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,924
- What do you want for Christmas? - Just you.

781
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:15,324
Andiamo, Fredo.

782
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:15,025
醒醒，弗雷多

783
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,361
叫保利备车，我们要走了

784
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:18,919
- Tell Paulie to get the car. - Okay, Pop.

785
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:18,691
好的，爸

786
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:22,364
我来开车，保利今早生病了

787
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:22,933
I'll have to get it myself. Paulie called in sick this morning.

788
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:27,899
Paulie's a good kid. I don't mind getting the car.

789
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:27,135
保利是个好孩子 我不介意自己开车

790
00:41:31,444 --> 00:41:33,537
谢谢

791
00:41:31,444 --> 00:41:33,435
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

792
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:20,682
-路卡，我是布诺塔塔基利亚 -我知道

793
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:20,818
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia. - I know.

794
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,918
想喝杯威士忌吗？

795
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:24,256
先暖和一下

796
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,020
我不喝酒

797
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:32,002
You know who I am?

798
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:31,727
你知道我是谁吗？

799
00:42:32,138 --> 00:42:33,605
I know you.

800
00:42:32,204 --> 00:42:33,569
我认识你

801
00:42:33,672 --> 00:42:37,267
你和塔塔基利亚家族谈过了 对吧？

802
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,176
You have been talking to the Tattaglia family... right?

803
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:43,309
I think you and I can do business.

804
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:43,546
我认为我们可以一起做些生意

805
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:47,409
I need someone strong like you.

806
00:42:44,984 --> 00:42:47,509
我需要像你这么壮的人

807
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:51,182
I heard you are not happy...

808
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:55,021
我听说你与柯里昂家族不和

809
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:53,588
...with the Corleone family.

810
00:42:53,726 --> 00:42:57,355
Want to join me?

811
00:42:55,795 --> 00:42:57,387
想加入我们吗？

812
00:42:57,497 --> 00:42:59,897
What's in it for me?

813
00:42:57,563 --> 00:42:59,360
我能得到什么好处？

814
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:03,764
$50,000 to start with.

815
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:03,523
起薪五万元

816
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:09,503
Not bad!

817
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:08,806
还不坏

818
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:12,907
同意了？

819
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:12,406
Agreed?

820
00:44:10,603 --> 00:44:14,300
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

821
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,605
汤姆哈金，圣诞快乐

822
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:16,101
我很高兴遇见你

823
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,434
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you. - I haven't got time.

824
00:44:16,342 --> 00:44:18,742
-我想跟你聊聊 -我没时间

825
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:22,605
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

826
00:44:19,745 --> 00:44:22,805
为我们拨点时间，军师，上车

827
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:25,780
你担心什么？

828
00:44:24,384 --> 00:44:29,048
What are you worried about? If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.

829
00:44:25,918 --> 00:44:27,818
我想杀你的话你早已死了

830
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:30,282
上车

831
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:30,553
Get in.

832
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:45,164
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit. - Okay, Pop.

833
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,862
稍候一下，弗雷多 我买点水果

834
00:44:44,003 --> 00:44:45,129
好的，爸

835
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:54,935
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

836
00:44:51,644 --> 00:44:54,807
圣诞快乐，我要买些水果

837
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:00,876
那个给我

838
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:24,536
弗雷多

839
00:46:14,593 --> 00:46:15,651
爸爸

840
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:26,395
Would you like me better if I were a nun? Like in the story.

841
00:46:22,434 --> 00:46:24,698
麦克，我若是修女 你是否会更喜欢我

842
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,337
就像小说中的角色 你知道吗？

843
00:46:29,442 --> 00:46:30,602
No.

844
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:30,565
不会

845
00:46:30,676 --> 00:46:33,440
若我是英格丽褒曼 你是否会更喜欢我？

846
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:35,476
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman? - Now, that's a thought.

847
00:46:33,712 --> 00:46:35,077
这个想法不错

848
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,107
Michael.

849
00:46:37,616 --> 00:46:38,776
麦克

850
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:44,417
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

851
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:41,778
不，你若是英格丽褒曼 我不会更喜欢你的

852
00:46:42,488 --> 00:46:44,353
-麦克 -怎么回事？

853
00:46:52,297 --> 00:46:54,265
（维多柯里昂被谋杀）

854
00:47:00,773 --> 00:47:03,571
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

855
00:47:00,873 --> 00:47:03,068
上面没说他是死是活

856
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:28,864
- Sonny, it's Michael. - Where have you been?

857
00:47:25,631 --> 00:47:28,862
-山尼！我是麦克 -麦克，你到哪去了？

858
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:33,836
-他没事吧？ -我们还不知道

859
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:31,663
- Is he all right? - We don't know yet.

860
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:36,639
There are all kinds of stories. He was hit bad, Mikey.

861
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,364
他伤的很重，麦克

862
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:40,903
- Are you there? - Yeah, I'm here.

863
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,276
-你还在吗？ -是的，我在这

864
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:45,582
-你到哪去了？我很担心 -汤姆没说我打过电话吗？

865
00:47:41,047 --> 00:47:45,507
- Where have you been? I was worried. - Didn't Tom tell you I called?

866
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:50,315
No. Look, come home, kid. You should be with Mama, you hear?

867
00:47:45,684 --> 00:47:49,415
听我说，回家来 你应该在这陪妈妈的

868
00:47:49,555 --> 00:47:50,613
好的

869
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,527
Oh, my God.

870
00:47:57,963 --> 00:47:59,430
我的天啊

871
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:04,926
Sonny!

872
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:04,493
山尼

873
00:48:13,879 --> 00:48:15,847
Stay back there.

874
00:48:15,982 --> 00:48:18,746
- Who is it? - Open up, it's Clemenza.

875
00:48:16,148 --> 00:48:18,514
-谁？ -开门！我是克里曼沙

876
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:22,852
又有你老头的消息了

877
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,146
There's more news about your old man.

878
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:26,952
Word is out that he's already dead.

879
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:26,152
街头谣传他已经死了

880
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:30,455
-你是怎么回事？ -山尼，别激动

881
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:30,961
- What's the matter with you? - Take it easy!

882
00:48:31,096 --> 00:48:32,085
保利在哪？

883
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:34,294
- Where was Paulie? - Sick. He's been sick all winter.

884
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:34,459
保利病了，他整个冬天都病了

885
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:37,368
- How often? - Only three, four times.

886
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:37,000
-他病了几次？ -病了三四次

887
00:48:37,102 --> 00:48:40,833
-弗雷多并不想另找保镖 -马上接他来

888
00:48:37,503 --> 00:48:40,802
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard. - Pick him up now.

889
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:42,372
我不管他病的有多重

890
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,536
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him to my father's house right now.

891
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:44,406
只要他还在呼吸 我要你把他带到家父的房子去

892
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,908
现在！明白吗？现在！

893
00:48:45,678 --> 00:48:49,011
- You want anyone sent over here? - No. Go ahead.

894
00:48:46,078 --> 00:48:47,102
好，你要我派人到这边来吗？

895
00:48:47,212 --> 00:48:48,873
不用！去吧！

896
00:48:56,622 --> 00:49:00,524
我会派几个人到家里来

897
00:48:58,124 --> 00:49:01,525
I'm going to have a couple of our people come over to the house.

898
00:49:04,763 --> 00:49:07,197
-你好 -山尼柯里昂吗？

899
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,057
- Hello? - Santino Corleone?

900
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,134
- Yeah. - We have Tom Hagen.

901
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:09,597
-我就是 -汤姆哈金在我们手上

902
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:13,761
In three hours he'll be released with our proposition.

903
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:12,903
约三小时后我们会释放他

904
00:49:13,906 --> 00:49:17,205
Listen to what he has to say before you do anything.

905
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:16,874
在你做任何事之前 先听听他说的话

906
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:21,905
What's done is done. Don't lose that famous temper of yours, Sonny.

907
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:18,773
木已成舟

908
00:49:19,011 --> 00:49:21,639
先别发怒，好吗？山尼

909
00:49:22,048 --> 00:49:23,743
I'll wait.

910
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:23,239
不会的，我会等

911
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:40,055
Your boss is dead.

912
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,620
你的老板死了

913
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:47,339
I know you're not in the muscle end of the family, so don't be scared.

914
00:49:42,935 --> 00:49:45,233
我知道你在家族中 是不喜欢动武

915
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:46,928
所以我不想要你感到害怕

916
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:52,810
I want you to help the Corleones and me.

917
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:52,603
我要你帮助柯里昂还有帮我

918
00:49:56,315 --> 00:50:00,809
We got him outside his office about an hour after we picked you up.

919
00:49:56,348 --> 00:49:57,872
接了你约一小时后

920
00:49:57,983 --> 00:50:00,451
我们已在他办公室外干掉他了

921
00:50:02,355 --> 00:50:03,617
Drink it.

922
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:03,376
喝吧

923
00:50:07,993 --> 00:50:11,451
It's up to you to make peace between me and Sonny.

924
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,320
现在全看你的了

925
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:11,621
让我与山尼和平解决一切

926
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:18,665
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

927
00:50:15,934 --> 00:50:17,993
山尼对我的主意很热中 不是吗？

928
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:21,970
而且你知道那么做是对的

929
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:22,939
And you knew it was the right thing to do.

930
00:50:24,076 --> 00:50:29,514
- Sonny will come after you. - That will be his first reaction, sure.

931
00:50:24,176 --> 00:50:26,371
山尼会不惜一切的来追杀你

932
00:50:27,412 --> 00:50:29,710
那会是他的第一个反应

933
00:50:30,616 --> 00:50:36,384
So you have to talk sense into him. The Tattaglia family is behind me.

934
00:50:30,716 --> 00:50:32,684
所以要你去劝劝他

935
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:36,848
塔塔基利亚家族全力支持我

936
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:41,626
纽约其他的家族 也会不惜一切防止全面的战争

937
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:42,251
The other New York families will go along with anything to prevent war.

938
00:50:42,395 --> 00:50:48,231
Let's face it, with all due respect, the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

939
00:50:42,427 --> 00:50:43,587
让我们面对现实吧！汤姆

940
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:44,956
我们全都尊敬他

941
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,463
但教父已今非昔比 愿他安息！

942
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:53,595
Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?

943
00:50:50,669 --> 00:50:53,365
十年前我能对付他吗？

944
00:50:57,476 --> 00:51:01,970
Well, now he's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back.

945
00:50:57,509 --> 00:50:58,533
但现在他已经死了

946
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:59,699
他死了，汤姆

947
00:50:59,878 --> 00:51:01,573
没什么能让他复生

948
00:51:03,215 --> 00:51:09,620
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

949
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:04,977
所以你得和山尼谈谈

950
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:09,543
也得说服两个大头目 泰西欧及肥克里曼沙

951
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:16,527
It's good business, Tom.

952
00:51:14,126 --> 00:51:15,889
那是笔好生意，汤姆

953
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:22,797
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.

954
00:51:17,629 --> 00:51:19,153
我试试看

955
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:22,932
但即使是山尼也阻止不了路卡

956
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:27,201
Yeah, well...

957
00:51:25,504 --> 00:51:31,204
这个…路卡让我来担心

958
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:31,373
Let me worry about Luca.

959
00:51:36,682 --> 00:51:38,547
You just talk to Sonny.

960
00:51:36,782 --> 00:51:38,477
你只管说服山尼

961
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:41,381
And the other two kids.

962
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:41,116
及他另外两个兄弟

963
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:47,157
-我尽力而为 -很好

964
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:47,089
- I'll do my best. - Good.

965
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:52,256
Now you can go.

966
00:51:49,194 --> 00:51:52,163
现在…你可以走了

967
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:02,166
我不喜欢暴力，汤姆 我是个生意人

968
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:03,270
I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman.

969
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:05,200
流血代价太高了

970
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:05,877
Blood is a big expense.

971
00:52:26,932 --> 00:52:28,729
He's still alive.

972
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:28,364
他还活着

973
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:32,861
They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!

974
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,698
他们打了他五枪，他还活着

975
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:37,999
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal.

976
00:52:33,038 --> 00:52:34,562
那对我是件坏事

977
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,607
若你不能谈成那档事 对你也不是好事

978
00:53:22,354 --> 00:53:24,379
令堂在医院陪令尊

979
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:26,722
Your mother is at the hospital with your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

980
00:53:24,556 --> 00:53:26,319
看起来他能度过难关 谢天谢地

981
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:35,423
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

982
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:33,527
-全是塔塔基利亚家族策划的 -你认为如何？

983
00:53:34,366 --> 00:53:35,697
教父认为这是设计好的

984
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:39,129
- You gonna kill all those guys? - Stay out of it.

985
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:38,827
-你要把那些人全杀掉？ -别插手这件事，麦克

986
00:53:39,004 --> 00:53:41,632
索拉索是关键 除掉他一切就好办了

987
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:41,671
If you get rid of Sollozzo, everything falls into line.

988
00:53:41,807 --> 00:53:46,176
What about Luca? Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

989
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,274
路卡呢？ 索拉索认为他可以控制路卡

990
00:53:44,443 --> 00:53:46,172
我不知道

991
00:53:46,312 --> 00:53:49,770
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

992
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:49,802
如果路卡出卖我们 我们就有大麻烦了

993
00:53:49,915 --> 00:53:53,817
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca? - We've been trying all night.

994
00:53:49,981 --> 00:53:51,881
有人能与路卡连络上吗？

995
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:53,883
我试了一整夜但没有人接

996
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:58,219
- Hey, do me a favour... - Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

997
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:56,818
麦克，帮我个忙 打电话给路卡

998
00:53:56,922 --> 00:53:59,550
他从不在外留宿 他每次办完事会立刻回家

999
00:53:59,892 --> 00:54:05,091
Well, Tom, you're consigliere. What do we do if the old man dies?

1000
00:53:59,925 --> 00:54:02,951
汤姆，你是军师

1001
00:54:03,328 --> 00:54:06,263
若是老头死了 我们该怎么办？

1002
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:12,433
If we lose the old man, we lose the political contacts and half our strength.

1003
00:54:06,364 --> 00:54:08,161
我们万一失去了老头

1004
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:12,537
我们就会失去政界的连系

1005
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:17,873
The other New York families might support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

1006
00:54:12,637 --> 00:54:15,333
纽约其他的家族 为了避免长期的战争

1007
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,136
可能会联合支持索拉索

1008
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:22,640
This is almost 1946. Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

1009
00:54:18,243 --> 00:54:20,438
现在是1946年了

1010
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:22,136
没有人想再流血了

1011
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:24,442
If your father dies...

1012
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,346
若是令尊死了

1013
00:54:26,986 --> 00:54:28,419
...you make the deal.

1014
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:28,485
就由你做决定了，山尼

1015
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:33,355
- Easy to say. He's not your father. - I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

1016
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:31,220
你说来容易，那不是你父亲

1017
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:34,024
我与你跟麦克 对他来说都是儿子

1018
00:54:38,263 --> 00:54:39,787
What is it?

1019
00:54:38,363 --> 00:54:39,352
什么事？

1020
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:46,499
- Paulie, I told you to stay put. - The guy at the gates has a package.

1021
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:42,695
保利，我叫你在外面守着

1022
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,795
大门的人说收到一包东西

1023
00:54:45,904 --> 00:54:48,031
泰西欧，去看看是什么

1024
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:49,199
Tessio, go see what it is.

1025
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:53,069
你要我留在这？

1026
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:54,307
- Shall I stay? - Yeah. Are you all right?

1027
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:54,133
是的，留在这，你还好吧？

1028
00:54:54,246 --> 00:54:55,270
是的，我很好

1029
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:58,143
- I'm fine. - There's food. Are you hungry?

1030
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,281
有点吃的，你饿了吗？

1031
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:01,810
- No. - A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

1032
00:54:58,383 --> 00:54:59,372
不，没关系的

1033
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:01,314
喝杯酒吧！ 一点白兰地能让你舒服点

1034
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:02,511
-好吧 -去吧！孩子

1035
00:55:01,954 --> 00:55:04,514
- Go ahead. - That might be a good idea.

1036
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:04,179
那或许是个好主意

1037
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:11,122
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch. Paulie sold out the old man.

1038
00:55:06,424 --> 00:55:08,449
我要你立刻处置那个王八蛋

1039
00:55:08,793 --> 00:55:11,261
保利出卖了老头，那个混蛋

1040
00:55:11,263 --> 00:55:15,666
- Make that the first thing on your list. - Understood.

1041
00:55:11,363 --> 00:55:12,557
我不想再见到他

1042
00:55:12,664 --> 00:55:13,722
这是你第一件先要解决的工作

1043
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:15,891
-明白吗？ -明白

1044
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:20,228
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys and go to Luca's apartment.

1045
00:55:16,234 --> 00:55:18,168
麦克，明天你带几个人…

1046
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,101
到路卡的公寓去看看 等他出现

1047
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:23,766
也许我们不该让麦克 太直接涉入

1048
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:24,399
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up in this too directly.

1049
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:30,371
听我说…待在家里接电话 那会有大帮助的

1050
00:55:26,745 --> 00:55:30,272
Hanging around the house on the phone would be a big help.

1051
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:32,944
再试着打给路卡

1052
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,250
Try Luca again.

1053
00:55:42,227 --> 00:55:44,991
- What's this? - A Sicilian message.

1054
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,888
-这是什么？ -那是西西里人的口信

1055
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,621
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

1056
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:47,688
那表示路卡布拉西与鱼同眠了

1057
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,773
- I'm going. - When will you be home?

1058
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,907
-我现在要走了 -你今晚几点会回家？

1059
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:05,577
Probably late.

1060
00:56:04,082 --> 00:56:05,106
我不知道，也许会很晚

1061
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:11,989
- Don't forget the cannoli! - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1062
00:56:08,153 --> 00:56:11,350
-别忘了油饼 -知道了

1063
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:18,486
Rocco, sit on the other side. You block the rear-view mirror.

1064
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:16,516
罗可，坐到另一边去

1065
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:18,219
你挡住后照镜了

1066
00:56:19,764 --> 00:56:21,459
开始大发雷霆了

1067
00:56:19,965 --> 00:56:23,423
Sonny's running wild. He wants to go to mattresses already.

1068
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,431
他想要跟对手开战了

1069
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:25,662
我们得在西区找个地方藏匿

1070
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:29,371
We have to find a spot on the West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

1071
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:29,330
你试试西43街309号

1072
00:56:29,508 --> 00:56:32,966
- Know a good spot on the West Side? - I'll think about it.

1073
00:56:29,574 --> 00:56:33,101
-你知道西区有何好地方吗？ -我想想看

1074
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:36,809
Think while you're driving. I want to hit New York this month.

1075
00:56:33,211 --> 00:56:34,610
你开车的时候想想好吗？

1076
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:36,544
我这个月要找一天到纽约去

1077
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:38,678
Watch the kids.

1078
00:56:36,982 --> 00:56:38,745
倒车出去时留意小孩子

1079
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:55,330
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up 18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

1080
00:56:49,594 --> 00:56:51,892
保利，我要你到39街去

1081
00:56:51,997 --> 00:56:54,022
去买18个垫子

1082
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:55,723
然后把帐单拿给我

1083
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:56,798
Yeah, all right.

1084
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:58,393
确定要干净的

1085
00:56:56,935 --> 00:57:01,372
Make sure they're clean, because the guys will be there a long time.

1086
00:56:58,503 --> 00:57:00,903
因为我们要在那待段长时间

1087
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:03,337
它们是干净的，他们说消毒过

1088
00:57:01,507 --> 00:57:05,637
- They're clean and exterminated. - That's a bad word to use.

1089
00:57:03,508 --> 00:57:05,373
消毒，用那个字很不好

1090
00:57:05,477 --> 00:57:06,910
消毒，听听这个砘

1091
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:09,874
Exterminate! Watch out, so we don't exterminate you!

1092
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:08,775
小心点，我们才不会为你消毒

1093
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,370
那真是好笑

1094
00:57:16,154 --> 00:57:18,452
停到路旁去好吗？我要小便

1095
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:19,180
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

1096
00:58:00,732 --> 00:58:01,926
把枪留下

1097
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:04,097
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

1098
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:04,029
把油饼给我

1099
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:25,318
麦克…

1100
00:58:23,722 --> 00:58:25,519
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

1101
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:28,959
- Yeah. - Phone call!

1102
00:58:27,826 --> 00:58:29,350
你的电话！

1103
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,566
- Who is it? - Some girl.

1104
00:58:35,266 --> 00:58:37,166
-是谁？ -女孩子

1105
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,172
- Hello. Kay? - How's your father?

1106
00:58:41,873 --> 00:58:44,171
-你好，凯 -令尊还好吗？

1107
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:46,470
他很好，他能活过来

1108
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:46,106
He's going to make it.

1109
00:58:46,845 --> 00:58:48,676
I love you.

1110
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,242
我爱你

1111
00:58:49,948 --> 00:58:51,540
I love you!

1112
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:51,380
我爱你

1113
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:54,985
- Michael? - Yeah, I know.

1114
00:58:52,584 --> 00:58:54,609
-麦克 -是，我知道

1115
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,021
- Tell me you love me. - I can't talk.

1116
00:58:55,153 --> 00:58:56,484
告诉我你爱我

1117
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:58,149
我不能说

1118
00:58:58,156 --> 00:59:00,021
Can't you say it?

1119
00:58:58,256 --> 00:58:59,553
你不能说吗？

1120
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:02,993
I'll see you tonight.

1121
00:59:01,259 --> 00:59:02,624
我们今晚见

1122
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:06,888
Why don't you tell that nice girl you love her?

1123
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:06,861
麦克，你为何不说你爱她

1124
00:59:07,032 --> 00:59:11,833
I love you with all my heart. If I don't see you again soon, I'm going to die!

1125
00:59:07,098 --> 00:59:08,861
我全心全意的爱你

1126
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:11,663
我若不快点见到你，我会死的

1127
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:14,634
到这来，孩子，学点东西

1128
00:59:12,905 --> 00:59:17,740
Come and learn something. You might have to cook for 20 guys some day.

1129
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:17,264
有一天 你也许得为20个男人煮饭

1130
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:21,539
You start with a little oil, then fry some garlic.

1131
00:59:17,942 --> 00:59:21,571
一开始先倒点油，炸大蒜

1132
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:24,944
然后放番茄，炒一下

1133
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,050
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

1134
00:59:25,116 --> 00:59:26,640
别让它粘锅底

1135
00:59:27,185 --> 00:59:30,814
煮开了之后，加入香肠及肉丸

1136
00:59:27,185 --> 00:59:31,349
You get it to a boil, you shove in all your sausage and meatballs.

1137
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:35,317
Add a little bit of wine.

1138
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:34,882
再加一点点酒

1139
00:59:38,597 --> 00:59:43,000
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

1140
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,958
以及…

1141
00:59:40,165 --> 00:59:41,598
一点点糖

1142
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,225
那是我的秘方

1143
00:59:43,135 --> 00:59:47,401
Cut the crap. I have more important things for you. How's Paulie?

1144
00:59:43,301 --> 00:59:44,393
你别说废话了

1145
00:59:44,569 --> 00:59:46,264
我有更重要的事要让你去做

1146
00:59:46,638 --> 00:59:47,696
保利呢？

1147
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:49,769
You won't see him no more.

1148
00:59:47,772 --> 00:59:49,239
保利，你再也见不到他了

1149
00:59:51,142 --> 00:59:52,166
你要去哪？

1150
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:53,643
- Where are you going? - To the city.

1151
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:53,435
到城里去

1152
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:54,671
派保镖跟他一起去

1153
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:57,237
- Send bodyguards with him. - I'm going to the hospital...

1154
00:59:54,779 --> 00:59:56,246
我只是去医院看爸爸

1155
00:59:56,414 --> 00:59:57,506
我不管，派人跟他一起去

1156
00:59:57,382 --> 01:00:00,715
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

1157
00:59:57,649 --> 00:59:59,947
他不会有事的 索拉索知道他是“平民”

1158
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:02,749
-小心点 -是的

1159
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:02,979
- Be careful. - Yes, sir.

1160
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:08,188
Send somebody with him anyway.

1161
01:00:06,057 --> 01:00:07,422
还是派人跟他一起去

1162
01:00:36,655 --> 01:00:40,022
- I have to go. - Can I go with you?

1163
01:00:36,888 --> 01:00:39,482
-我得走了 -我能与你一起去吗？

1164
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:45,185
不，凯，那里有刑警还有记者

1165
01:00:41,226 --> 01:00:45,822
No, Kay. There will be detectives there, people from the press.

1166
01:00:45,964 --> 01:00:47,727
我在车上等你

1167
01:00:45,964 --> 01:00:48,262
I'll wait in the cab.

1168
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:53,030
I don't want you to get involved.

1169
01:00:50,468 --> 01:00:51,867
我不要你卷入这件事

1170
01:00:55,774 --> 01:00:58,242
When will I see you again?

1171
01:00:55,807 --> 01:00:57,399
我何时能再见到你？

1172
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:08,412
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll call you at your parents' house.

1173
01:01:04,382 --> 01:01:05,747
回新罕布夏去

1174
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:08,711
我打电话去你父母家找你

1175
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:15,082
- When will I see you again, Michael? - I don't know.

1176
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:12,155
我何时才能再见到你？麦克

1177
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:15,149
我不知道

1178
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:28,456
你在这里干什么？

1179
01:03:27,092 --> 01:03:30,892
What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here.

1180
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,584
现在不是探病时间

1181
01:03:30,928 --> 01:03:32,020
我是麦克柯里昂

1182
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:34,521
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

1183
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:33,392
这是家父

1184
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:37,226
What happened to the guards?

1185
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,734
这里没人，守卫到哪去了？

1186
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:42,397
Your father had too many visitors. They interfered with hospital service.

1187
01:03:37,402 --> 01:03:41,634
令尊访客太多 妨碍了医院的作业

1188
01:03:42,507 --> 01:03:45,203
警察在十分钟前要他们离去了

1189
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:45,908
The police made them leave about ten minutes ago.

1190
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:54,284
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

1191
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:54,349
请帮我接长滩45620

1192
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:59,788
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

1193
01:03:56,988 --> 01:03:59,388
护士，等一下，先别走

1194
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:08,096
Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got here late, there's nobody here.

1195
01:04:03,294 --> 01:04:05,125
山尼，我是麦克，我在医院

1196
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:07,621
听着，我很晚才到这儿 这没有人

1197
01:04:08,233 --> 01:04:12,260
No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.

1198
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:11,360
泰西欧的人不在 也没有刑警，没有人

1199
01:04:11,469 --> 01:04:12,629
爸爸单独一个人在这

1200
01:04:12,404 --> 01:04:15,100
- Don't panic. - I won't panic.

1201
01:04:12,737 --> 01:04:15,297
-别惊慌 -我不会惊慌

1202
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:19,443
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

1203
01:04:16,641 --> 01:04:18,871
我很抱歉，但你必须离去

1204
01:04:22,214 --> 01:04:27,982
We're going to move him to another room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

1205
01:04:22,246 --> 01:04:24,874
你帮我把家父移去另一间房

1206
01:04:24,982 --> 01:04:26,472
现在你是否能把这个拆开

1207
01:04:26,584 --> 01:04:28,017
我来推病床

1208
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:31,611
- That's out of the question! - Do you know my father?

1209
01:04:28,186 --> 01:04:30,814
-那是不可能的 -你认识家父吗？

1210
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:34,886
他们会来杀了他，懂吗？

1211
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:35,988
Men are coming here to kill him. Do you understand?

1212
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:38,118
Help me, please.

1213
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,627
现在请你帮我忙

1214
01:05:54,973 --> 01:05:58,773
- Who are you? - I am Enzo, the baker.

1215
01:05:55,106 --> 01:05:58,667
-你是谁？ -我是安索，那个糕饼师

1216
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:01,938
- Remember me? - Enzo.

1217
01:05:59,844 --> 01:06:01,038
-你还记得我吧？ -安索

1218
01:06:01,112 --> 01:06:02,136
是的，我是安索

1219
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,015
You'd better go, there's going to be trouble.

1220
01:06:02,213 --> 01:06:03,942
你最好离开这，安索 这里会有麻烦

1221
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:09,780
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to help you. For your father.

1222
01:06:05,216 --> 01:06:07,514
若是有麻烦，我留在这帮你

1223
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:09,743
为了令尊！…

1224
01:06:11,255 --> 01:06:12,552
好吧！听我说

1225
01:06:11,823 --> 01:06:15,884
Listen. Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital, all right?

1226
01:06:13,057 --> 01:06:15,821
在医院大门外面等我，好吗？

1227
01:06:16,027 --> 01:06:17,722
我马上出来，快去！

1228
01:06:16,027 --> 01:06:18,086
I'll be out in a minute.

1229
01:06:17,862 --> 01:06:19,420
好的…

1230
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:35,970
Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now.

1231
01:06:32,009 --> 01:06:33,636
好好休息吧！爸！

1232
01:06:34,445 --> 01:06:36,140
我会照料你的

1233
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:42,451
我和你在一起

1234
01:06:37,615 --> 01:06:39,640
I'm with you now.

1235
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:42,776
I'm with you.

1236
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:19,415
把这个丢掉

1237
01:07:18,323 --> 01:07:20,450
Get rid of these. Come here.

1238
01:07:19,724 --> 01:07:20,816
到这来

1239
01:07:21,426 --> 01:07:25,590
Put your hand in your pocket, like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

1240
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:23,288
把手放在口袋里 就像你有把枪

1241
01:07:24,295 --> 01:07:25,421
你不会有事的

1242
01:07:31,836 --> 01:07:32,860
你不会有事的

1243
01:08:17,248 --> 01:08:19,216
You did good.

1244
01:08:17,281 --> 01:08:18,543
你做的很好

1245
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,615
这是干什么？

1246
01:09:07,398 --> 01:09:10,595
I thought all you Guinea hoods were locked up!

1247
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:09,296
我以为把你们这些混混 全关住了

1248
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,492
你在这里干什么？

1249
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:13,193
守家父的人是怎么回事？

1250
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:15,172
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father? - You little punk!

1251
01:09:13,904 --> 01:09:17,271
你这个小混蛋，竟敢管我的事

1252
01:09:15,306 --> 01:09:19,208
Don't you tell me my business! I pulled them off.

1253
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:19,309
是我把那些人全赶走的

1254
01:09:19,344 --> 01:09:25,374
- Stay away from this hospital! - Not until my father's room is guarded.

1255
01:09:19,477 --> 01:09:21,968
你马上离开这医院

1256
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,506
除非你派人守护家父 否则我不会走

1257
01:09:26,084 --> 01:09:29,417
- Phil, take him in! - The kid's clean, Captain.

1258
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:27,607
菲尔，把他带回去

1259
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:29,416
那孩子是清白的，队长

1260
01:09:29,554 --> 01:09:33,786
- He's a war hero. He's never been... - I said take him in!

1261
01:09:29,653 --> 01:09:31,553
他是个服役荣归的英雄 从未和黑手党混在一起

1262
01:09:31,789 --> 01:09:33,416
该死的，我说把他带回去

1263
01:09:35,593 --> 01:09:41,395
- What's The Turk paying you? - Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

1264
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:38,685
索拉索付你多少钱 来陷害家父？

1265
01:09:39,363 --> 01:09:43,527
把他抓牢，让他站稳

1266
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,492
Stand him up straight.

1267
01:10:05,757 --> 01:10:11,457
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

1268
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,619
我是柯里昂家的律师

1269
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:09,323
这些人是私家侦探

1270
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:11,154
雇来保护维多柯里昂的

1271
01:10:11,595 --> 01:10:13,620
他们有携带武器的执照

1272
01:10:11,596 --> 01:10:13,860
They're licensed to carry firearms.

1273
01:10:13,998 --> 01:10:17,695
若是你干预，我们明早法庭见

1274
01:10:13,998 --> 01:10:18,492
If you interfere, you'll have to appear before the judge and show cause.

1275
01:10:18,636 --> 01:10:20,831
Let him go.

1276
01:10:18,702 --> 01:10:20,169
好了，让他走

1277
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:23,264
走吧

1278
01:10:53,037 --> 01:10:54,664
这些新面孔是怎么回事？

1279
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:56,868
- What's with all the new faces? - We'll need them now.

1280
01:10:55,172 --> 01:10:56,332
我们现在需要他们

1281
01:10:57,008 --> 01:10:59,533
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

1282
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,202
经过医院的事之后 山尼气疯了

1283
01:10:59,677 --> 01:11:02,805
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

1284
01:11:00,144 --> 01:11:02,977
我们今晨四点 干掉了布诺塔塔基利亚

1285
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:06,116
Jesus Christ.

1286
01:11:04,248 --> 01:11:05,681
老天爷

1287
01:11:12,991 --> 01:11:15,687
Looks like a fortress around here.

1288
01:11:13,123 --> 01:11:14,920
这里看起来像是座城堡

1289
01:11:17,428 --> 01:11:22,889
Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen on the street 24 hours a day.

1290
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:22,933
街上一天24小时 都有一百个枪手在巡逻

1291
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:26,264
那土耳其人敢露出一根汗毛 就挂了

1292
01:11:23,034 --> 01:11:26,663
That Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead.

1293
01:11:28,706 --> 01:11:30,697
Mike, let me look at you.

1294
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:30,934
麦克，到这里来，让我看看你

1295
01:11:34,779 --> 01:11:37,771
You're beautiful, beautiful. You're gorgeous.

1296
01:11:34,845 --> 01:11:37,370
你漂亮极了，漂亮极了

1297
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:43,581
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

1298
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:39,074
你们听我说

1299
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,774
那土耳其人想谈判

1300
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:43,419
那王八蛋紧张了

1301
01:11:43,721 --> 01:11:45,621
昨晚整我们，今天想和谈

1302
01:11:43,721 --> 01:11:46,383
- He wants a meeting today. - What did he say?

1303
01:11:46,023 --> 01:11:47,217
-他怎么说？ -他怎么说？

1304
01:11:46,524 --> 01:11:51,188
What did he say... He wants us to send Michael to hear the proposition.

1305
01:11:47,324 --> 01:11:51,158
他要我们派麦克去

1306
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:54,695
并保证那条件 好到我们不会拒绝

1307
01:11:51,329 --> 01:11:54,787
He promises that the deal is too good to refuse.

1308
01:11:54,932 --> 01:11:57,992
- And Bruno Tattaglia? - That's part of the deal.

1309
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:56,455
那布诺塔塔基利亚呢？

1310
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:58,000
那是条件的一部分

1311
01:11:58,102 --> 01:12:00,093
他作为对家父挨枪的补偿

1312
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:02,300
- He cancels out what they did to Father. - We should listen to them.

1313
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:01,966
山尼，我们该听听他们怎么说

1314
01:12:02,172 --> 01:12:05,630
不！…不再听了，军师

1315
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,500
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

1316
01:12:05,643 --> 01:12:09,170
No more meetings, discussions, or Sollozzo tricks.

1317
01:12:05,776 --> 01:12:09,212
不再和谈、不再讨论 不再上索拉索的当

1318
01:12:09,313 --> 01:12:12,111
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

1319
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,245
你去跟他们说，我要索拉索

1320
01:12:11,348 --> 01:12:12,474
否则我们就开战！

1321
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:15,344
- The other families... - They hand me Sollozzo!

1322
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:13,743
山尼，其他家族不会支持的

1323
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:15,375
叫他们把索拉索交给我

1324
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:18,080
山尼，令尊不会喜欢的 这是生意，不能感情用事

1325
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:18,080
This is business, not personal!

1326
01:12:18,222 --> 01:12:23,091
- They shot my father... - Even that was business, not personal.

1327
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:19,347
那我父亲就该挨枪了？

1328
01:12:19,456 --> 01:12:20,889
即使是令尊挨枪也是生意

1329
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,583
不是个人的事，山尼

1330
01:12:23,227 --> 01:12:26,924
Then business will have to suffer. Do me a favour.

1331
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,125
那生意必须要停，行吗？

1332
01:12:25,229 --> 01:12:26,662
听着，帮我个忙，汤姆

1333
01:12:26,764 --> 01:12:28,925
别再建议我如何让事情过去

1334
01:12:27,065 --> 01:12:31,092
No more advice on how to patch things up. Just help me win.

1335
01:12:29,033 --> 01:12:30,762
只要帮我赢，好吗？

1336
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:41,275
I found out about Captain McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw.

1337
01:12:37,508 --> 01:12:39,999
我查出了打断麦克下巴 那麦克劳斯基队长的事

1338
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,202
他怎么样？

1339
01:12:41,412 --> 01:12:45,610
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money.

1340
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:44,437
他肯定在索拉索的规费名单中 而且是很大一笔钱

1341
01:12:44,848 --> 01:12:47,681
麦克劳斯基是索拉索的保镖

1342
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,709
McCluskey has agreed to be The Turk's bodyguard.

1343
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:49,546
你必须要了解，山尼

1344
01:12:49,853 --> 01:12:51,980
当索拉索跟警察队长勾搭上时

1345
01:12:49,854 --> 01:12:53,688
So when Sollozzo is being guarded, he's invulnerable.

1346
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:53,454
没人可以碰他了

1347
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:57,421
过去从没人胆敢干掉纽约警官

1348
01:12:53,825 --> 01:12:57,352
Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain.

1349
01:12:57,495 --> 01:13:03,297
All the families would come after you. The Corleone family would be outcasts!

1350
01:12:57,528 --> 01:12:58,552
那会是个大灾难

1351
01:12:58,662 --> 01:13:00,527
所有五大家族都会追杀你 山尼

1352
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:03,122
柯里昂家族会被孤立！

1353
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:07,131
Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.

1354
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,867
即使是老头的 政治保护都会消失

1355
01:13:08,606 --> 01:13:12,770
Do me a favour. Take this into consideration.

1356
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:09,934
拜托你

1357
01:13:10,941 --> 01:13:12,909
别轻举妄动

1358
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,410
All right, we'll wait.

1359
01:13:16,413 --> 01:13:17,744
好吧！我们等

1360
01:13:23,521 --> 01:13:26,581
We can't wait. We can't wait.

1361
01:13:23,754 --> 01:13:25,119
我们不能等

1362
01:13:25,823 --> 01:13:26,881
我们不能等

1363
01:13:27,892 --> 01:13:31,760
No matter what Sollozzo says, he's going to kill Pop.

1364
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:30,826
不管索拉索答应什么 他会杀了爸爸的

1365
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:33,259
那是他的关键

1366
01:13:31,896 --> 01:13:35,662
That's the key for him. We've got to get Sollozzo.

1367
01:13:33,864 --> 01:13:35,058
必须干掉索拉索

1368
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,100
- Mike is right. - Let me ask you something.

1369
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:37,025
麦克说的对

1370
01:13:37,868 --> 01:13:40,132
那个谈判就没有必要了

1371
01:13:40,237 --> 01:13:41,761
这个麦克劳斯基呢？

1372
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,902
What about this McCluskey? What do we do with this cop?

1373
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:45,032
我们要拿这个条子怎么办？

1374
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:52,711
They want to have a meeting with me, right?

1375
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,914
他们想与我开会，对吧？

1376
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:58,415
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

1377
01:13:53,884 --> 01:13:58,548
那会是我 麦克劳斯基及索拉索

1378
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,287
Let's set the meeting.

1379
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,580
我们来安排会议

1380
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:08,460
Get our informers to find out where it's going to be held.

1381
01:14:04,328 --> 01:14:07,525
我们查清楚会议地点在哪里

1382
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:13,462
We insist it's a public place. A bar, a restaurant.

1383
01:14:09,933 --> 01:14:13,630
必须是公开场所，酒吧或餐厅

1384
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:17,768
Some place where there are people, so I feel safe.

1385
01:14:13,737 --> 01:14:17,901
人多的地方对我比较安全

1386
01:14:20,178 --> 01:14:23,045
They'll search me when I meet them, right?

1387
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:22,974
我与他们一见面 他们会搜身，对吧

1388
01:14:23,181 --> 01:14:25,479
So I can't have a weapon on me.

1389
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,245
那么我身上不能有武器

1390
01:14:29,019 --> 01:14:31,385
若克里曼沙能想出一个办法

1391
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:34,652
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to have a weapon planted there for me...

1392
01:14:31,789 --> 01:14:34,257
能预先把武器放在那

1393
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:41,626
...then I'll kill them both.

1394
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:40,621
那我就能杀了他们两个

1395
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:55,838
你要怎么做？乖乖的大学生

1396
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:57,910
Nice college boy. Didn't want to get mixed up in the family business.

1397
01:14:56,113 --> 01:14:57,546
你不是不想和家族中的事 混在一块吗？

1398
01:14:57,648 --> 01:15:01,744
现在因为他打了你 你就想干掉他？

1399
01:14:58,049 --> 01:15:01,644
Now you want to shoot a police captain because he slapped you?

1400
01:15:01,786 --> 01:15:08,282
This isn't like the army! You have to get close and get their brains on your suit.

1401
01:15:01,819 --> 01:15:02,911
你以为这里是什么？军队吗？

1402
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:04,078
在一哩以外开枪打他们？

1403
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:05,983
你必须离这么近，砰一声

1404
01:15:06,123 --> 01:15:08,023
他们的脑浆会溅到你身上

1405
01:15:08,192 --> 01:15:11,559
-山尼… -你太感情用事了

1406
01:15:08,426 --> 01:15:11,452
You're taking this very personal.

1407
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:15,032
Tom, this is business and he's taking it personal.

1408
01:15:11,729 --> 01:15:14,892
汤姆，这是公事 而他却感情用事

1409
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:18,795
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop? - Mikey...

1410
01:15:15,232 --> 01:15:17,325
谁说不能杀条子的？

1411
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:19,835
-别这样，麦克 -汤姆，慢着

1412
01:15:18,936 --> 01:15:25,637
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop.

1413
01:15:19,903 --> 01:15:22,599
他是个跟毒品买卖有关的条子

1414
01:15:22,773 --> 01:15:25,401
他是个不诚实的条子

1415
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:29,712
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming.

1416
01:15:25,843 --> 01:15:29,472
和毒贩混在一起 终于得到报应

1417
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:34,945
That's a terrific story. We have newspaper people on the payroll, right?

1418
01:15:30,314 --> 01:15:31,941
那是个好极了的故事

1419
01:15:32,116 --> 01:15:34,380
报社不是有我们的人吗？

1420
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:40,181
- They might like a story like that. - They might.

1421
01:15:36,253 --> 01:15:37,811
他们也许对那故事有兴趣

1422
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:40,184
他们也许，只是也许

1423
01:15:43,728 --> 01:15:47,289
It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.

1424
01:15:43,827 --> 01:15:47,456
不是感情用事，山尼 纯粹是公事

1425
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:55,600
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints.

1426
01:15:50,434 --> 01:15:53,130
做过表面处理了，追踪不到的

1427
01:15:53,237 --> 01:15:55,603
不用担心指纹

1428
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:58,334
我在扳机和手把上 贴了特殊胶布

1429
01:15:55,740 --> 01:16:00,109
I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt. Try it.

1430
01:15:58,509 --> 01:16:00,067
来，试试看

1431
01:16:12,056 --> 01:16:14,149
Is the trigger too tight?

1432
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:14,113
怎么了？扳机太紧了？

1433
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:18,585
我的耳朵好辛苦

1434
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:18,755
My ears!

1435
01:16:18,695 --> 01:16:23,325
我没安装消声器 那样才能吓走旁观的人

1436
01:16:18,896 --> 01:16:24,493
I left it noisy, so it scares away any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

1437
01:16:24,635 --> 01:16:27,263
You've shot them both. Now what do you do?

1438
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:25,690
好了，你杀了他们两个

1439
01:16:25,836 --> 01:16:26,928
接下来你怎么办？

1440
01:16:29,507 --> 01:16:33,466
- Sit down, finish my dinner. - Don't fool around.

1441
01:16:29,606 --> 01:16:31,403
坐下吃完我的晚餐

1442
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,499
别开玩笑

1443
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:37,103
Let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out.

1444
01:16:33,644 --> 01:16:36,943
就让你的手垂下，让枪滑掉

1445
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,976
每个人都认为你还拿着枪

1446
01:16:37,248 --> 01:16:41,514
Everybody will still think you've got it. They'll stare at your face,

1447
01:16:39,449 --> 01:16:41,349
他们会瞪着你的脸，麦克

1448
01:16:41,652 --> 01:16:44,587
so walk out fast, but don't run.

1449
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:44,313
所以快步离开那地方但不要跑

1450
01:16:44,722 --> 01:16:48,089
Don't look anybody in the eye, but don't look away either.

1451
01:16:44,755 --> 01:16:47,724
别直视任何人 但也不要看其他地方

1452
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:51,889
他们会怕的不敢瞪你 相信我，不必担心

1453
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:51,558
They'll be scared stiff, so don't worry about nothing.

1454
01:16:53,831 --> 01:16:57,995
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation, nobody knows where,

1455
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:55,559
你若可以全身而退

1456
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:58,031
可以休个长假到哪里都可以

1457
01:16:58,135 --> 01:16:59,830
and we'll catch the hell.

1458
01:16:58,202 --> 01:16:59,533
而我们会处理善后

1459
01:17:00,838 --> 01:17:04,137
-你认为后果会有多糟？ -他妈的蛮糟的

1460
01:17:00,838 --> 01:17:04,569
- How bad do you think it will be? - Pretty goddamn bad.

1461
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:07,769
All the other families will probably line up against us.

1462
01:17:04,775 --> 01:17:07,266
可能所有的家族 会联合对付我们

1463
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,837
那没关系的

1464
01:17:07,912 --> 01:17:13,441
These things have to happen every five, ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

1465
01:17:08,946 --> 01:17:12,040
每五年或十年都会发生一次

1466
01:17:12,282 --> 01:17:13,874
害群之马必须要除掉

1467
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:18,021
Been ten years since the last one. You have to stop them at the beginning.

1468
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:15,508
上一次到现在已有十年了

1469
01:17:16,453 --> 01:17:18,114
要先发制人

1470
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:24,219
Like they should have stopped Hitler in Munich, not letting him get away with it.

1471
01:17:18,288 --> 01:17:20,188
就像要在慕尼黑 制止希特勒一样

1472
01:17:20,424 --> 01:17:24,155
他们容忍了希特勒 麻烦就大了

1473
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:29,632
You know, Mike, we were all proud of you. Being a hero and all.

1474
01:17:25,262 --> 01:17:26,593
知道吗？麦克

1475
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:29,255
我们都以你为荣 你是个英雄

1476
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:31,701
Your father too.

1477
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,095
你父亲也是

1478
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:13,043
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

1479
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:12,709
没有任何线索，什么都没有

1480
01:18:14,045 --> 01:18:18,243
Even Sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held.

1481
01:18:14,144 --> 01:18:16,772
索拉索的人也不知在哪里开会

1482
01:18:18,382 --> 01:18:21,215
How much time do we have?

1483
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:19,642
我有多少时间？

1484
01:18:21,352 --> 01:18:26,153
They're going to pick you up outside Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

1485
01:18:21,385 --> 01:18:25,617
一小时半以后 他们在达西路口接你上车

1486
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:32,485
- We could put a tail on them. - Sollozzo would lose our ass.

1487
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:28,922
我们派个人追踪他们

1488
01:18:29,026 --> 01:18:32,587
索拉索会在街上乱转 甩掉我们的人

1489
01:18:33,631 --> 01:18:38,193
- What about the negotiator? - He's playing pinochle with my men.

1490
01:18:33,664 --> 01:18:35,063
来找我们谈判的人呢？

1491
01:18:35,532 --> 01:18:38,262
他在那边和我的手下玩纸牌

1492
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:43,295
- He's happy. They're letting him win. - Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

1493
01:18:38,435 --> 01:18:39,629
他很高兴，我们在让他赢

1494
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,798
对麦克太危险了

1495
01:18:41,905 --> 01:18:43,270
山尼，也许我们该取消

1496
01:18:43,373 --> 01:18:45,136
要麦克平安回来

1497
01:18:43,441 --> 01:18:46,968
The negotiator plays cards until Mike is back safe.

1498
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:47,005
我们才会让那个人走的

1499
01:18:47,111 --> 01:18:50,877
- He could blast whoever is in the car. - They'll expect that.

1500
01:18:47,177 --> 01:18:49,236
何不干脆干掉车上的人呢？

1501
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:50,973
太危险了，他们会注意的

1502
01:18:51,015 --> 01:18:54,348
Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny!

1503
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,208
索拉索也许根本就不在车上

1504
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:55,816
I'll get it.

1505
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:55,676
我来接

1506
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:23,543
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

1507
01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:22,970
布朗区的路易士餐厅

1508
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,738
可靠吗？

1509
01:19:23,681 --> 01:19:26,445
- Is it reliable? - My man in McCluskey's precinct.

1510
01:19:24,848 --> 01:19:26,543
麦克劳斯基的分局里有我的人

1511
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:32,580
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

1512
01:19:26,817 --> 01:19:29,445
队长必须24小时待命

1513
01:19:29,586 --> 01:19:31,645
他八点到十点会去那里

1514
01:19:32,723 --> 01:19:37,456
- Anybody know this joint? - Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

1515
01:19:32,756 --> 01:19:33,950
有谁知道那个地方

1516
01:19:34,091 --> 01:19:35,456
我知道

1517
01:19:36,393 --> 01:19:37,724
对我们太理想了

1518
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:42,692
A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

1519
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:39,886
家庭餐厅，食物精美

1520
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:42,590
各吃各的，太理想了

1521
01:19:42,766 --> 01:19:45,633
彼得，那儿有个旧式马桶

1522
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:48,871
They've got an old-fashioned toilet. You know, the box and the chain thing.

1523
01:19:45,736 --> 01:19:48,933
你知道就是水箱有吊链的那种

1524
01:19:50,608 --> 01:19:53,076
We might be able to tape the gun behind it.

1525
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,609
我们或许可把枪用胶带绑在那

1526
01:19:53,744 --> 01:19:57,646
好的，麦克，你去餐厅

1527
01:19:53,744 --> 01:19:57,874
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

1528
01:19:58,015 --> 01:20:01,951
you eat, talk for a while, you relax. Make them relax.

1529
01:19:58,048 --> 01:20:00,278
你一面吃一面聊，别紧张

1530
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:01,884
也可以使对方轻松下来

1531
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:03,815
然后你站起来去上厕所

1532
01:20:02,086 --> 01:20:07,251
Then you go to take a leak. No, better still, you ask permission to go.

1533
01:20:04,488 --> 01:20:07,218
你得先徵求对方同意再去

1534
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:09,086
回来时就开枪

1535
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:12,021
Then you come back blasting. Two shots in the head apiece.

1536
01:20:09,192 --> 01:20:12,127
别失误，对准头颅各开两枪

1537
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:16,222
听着，我要一个好手去藏枪

1538
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:16,089
I want somebody very good to plant that gun.

1539
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:19,202
I don't want him coming out with just his dick.

1540
01:20:16,366 --> 01:20:17,560
我不希望我弟弟出来时

1541
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:19,531
手无寸铁

1542
01:20:19,637 --> 01:20:25,303
- The gun will be there. - You drive him and pick him up.

1543
01:20:19,703 --> 01:20:21,068
枪会在那的

1544
01:20:21,304 --> 01:20:24,501
你开车送他，事后再接他回来

1545
01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:27,842
Let's move.

1546
01:20:25,475 --> 01:20:26,737
来吧！我们动身了

1547
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:35,710
Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?

1548
01:20:32,749 --> 01:20:35,809
他告诉过你事成之后 立刻丢枪吗？

1549
01:20:35,853 --> 01:20:37,753
Yeah, a million times.

1550
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:37,318
几百万次了

1551
01:20:41,658 --> 01:20:46,152
切记！朝每人头部开两枪 一出厕所后就打

1552
01:20:42,526 --> 01:20:47,054
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in the head as soon as you come out.

1553
01:20:53,237 --> 01:20:56,434
How long do you think it will be before I can come back?

1554
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,395
你们认为要多久我才能回家？

1555
01:20:57,808 --> 01:20:59,799
At least a year.

1556
01:20:57,841 --> 01:20:59,809
至少得一年，麦克

1557
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:04,404
我会转告妈 你临走前不能去看她

1558
01:20:59,944 --> 01:21:05,075
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not seeing her before you leave and...

1559
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:09,708
I'll get a message to that girlfriend when the time is right.

1560
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:09,980
我会告诉你女朋友的

1561
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:17,656
Take care.

1562
01:21:16,026 --> 01:21:17,459
保重！

1563
01:21:20,531 --> 01:21:22,294
Take care, Mike.

1564
01:21:20,697 --> 01:21:22,631
保重！麦克

1565
01:21:54,798 --> 01:21:58,598
I'm glad you came. I hope we can straighten everything out.

1566
01:21:54,898 --> 01:21:56,263
我很高兴你来了，麦克

1567
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,761
希望我们能把事情谈妥

1568
01:21:59,836 --> 01:22:03,067
这种事太可怕了 我并不希望发生这种事

1569
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:04,807
It's not the way I wanted things to go. It should never have happened.

1570
01:22:03,573 --> 01:22:05,006
不该发生这种事的

1571
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:09,242
I want to straighten everything out. I don't want my father bothered again.

1572
01:22:05,108 --> 01:22:06,700
我会在今晚解决一切

1573
01:22:06,977 --> 01:22:09,002
我不希望我爸烦心

1574
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:12,645
I swear on my children that he won't be, Mike.

1575
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:10,504
会解决的，麦克

1576
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,648
我以我孩子之名发誓

1577
01:22:13,717 --> 01:22:16,880
But you have to keep an open mind when we talk.

1578
01:22:13,783 --> 01:22:16,149
不过谈的时候，你得坦诚才行

1579
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:19,185
希望你不像令兄的坏脾气

1580
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:22,687
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny. You can't talk business with him.

1581
01:22:19,322 --> 01:22:21,290
简直没办法和他谈正事

1582
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:22,915
（意大利文）

1583
01:22:22,826 --> 01:22:24,987
He's a good kid.

1584
01:22:23,326 --> 01:22:24,520
他是个好孩子

1585
01:22:28,999 --> 01:22:32,526
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

1586
01:22:29,132 --> 01:22:31,225
那晚的事我很抱歉，麦克

1587
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:37,073
I've got to frisk you, so turn around. On your knees, facing me.

1588
01:22:32,702 --> 01:22:34,897
我得搜你的身，转过来

1589
01:22:35,238 --> 01:22:37,331
跪在椅子上，脸向我

1590
01:22:41,578 --> 01:22:44,240
我想我干这行已经嫌老了

1591
01:22:41,645 --> 01:22:46,378
I guess I'm getting too old for my job. Too grouchy.

1592
01:22:45,482 --> 01:22:46,744
太多话了

1593
01:22:47,651 --> 01:22:51,587
Can't stand the aggravation. You know how it is.

1594
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:51,582
受不了别人的激怒 你该明白吧

1595
01:22:53,924 --> 01:22:55,016
He's clean.

1596
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:55,115
他没带砘

1597
01:23:22,052 --> 01:23:24,316
Going to Jersey?

1598
01:23:22,219 --> 01:23:23,345
到新泽西去？

1599
01:23:26,824 --> 01:23:28,382
Maybe.

1600
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:28,050
也许

1601
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,709
Nice work, Lou.

1602
01:23:53,717 --> 01:23:54,741
漂亮极了，路

1603
01:24:09,099 --> 01:24:12,466
（路易士餐厅）

1604
01:24:32,389 --> 01:24:38,055
- How's the food in this restaurant? - Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

1605
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:34,590
这里的意大利菜 味道还可以吧？

1606
01:24:34,924 --> 01:24:36,016
很棒

1607
01:24:36,126 --> 01:24:37,991
试试这里的小牛肉 是本市最棒的

1608
01:24:38,195 --> 01:24:39,856
I'll have it.

1609
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:39,250
给我来一份

1610
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:42,562
快！

1611
01:25:12,162 --> 01:25:13,356
好了

1612
01:25:15,231 --> 01:25:17,495
我要和麦克用意大利文交谈

1613
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:18,698
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey. - Go ahead.

1614
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:18,956
请便

1615
01:25:25,075 --> 01:25:27,703
（意大利文）

1616
01:26:38,081 --> 01:26:39,810
What I want...

1617
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:42,877
对我而言最重要的是

1618
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:43,476
What's most important to me...

1619
01:26:45,722 --> 01:26:49,954
...is that I have a guarantee. No more attempts on my father's life.

1620
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:50,089
保证家父的性命安全

1621
01:26:50,093 --> 01:26:54,291
What guarantees can I give you? I'm the hunted one!

1622
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:52,194
你要我怎么保证？麦克

1623
01:26:53,296 --> 01:26:54,695
我也是惊弓之鸟

1624
01:26:54,932 --> 01:26:57,958
I missed my chance. You think too much of me, kid.

1625
01:26:54,998 --> 01:26:56,590
我也失手

1626
01:26:56,699 --> 01:26:58,132
你太看重我了，孩子

1627
01:26:58,301 --> 01:26:59,928
我没有那么精明

1628
01:26:58,535 --> 01:27:00,264
I'm not that clever.

1629
01:27:01,905 --> 01:27:04,135
All I want is a truce.

1630
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:04,940
我想要的只是息战而已

1631
01:27:10,713 --> 01:27:14,615
我必须要上厕所，可以吗？

1632
01:27:10,781 --> 01:27:14,410
I have to go to the bathroom. Is it all right?

1633
01:27:15,953 --> 01:27:17,420
When you got to go, you got to go.

1634
01:27:16,052 --> 01:27:17,349
想去就去吧

1635
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,384
He's clean.

1636
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,655
我搜过了，他没带砘

1637
01:27:25,795 --> 01:27:27,262
别去太久

1638
01:27:26,029 --> 01:27:28,088
Don't take too long.

1639
01:27:31,368 --> 01:27:32,960
I've frisked a thousand punks.

1640
01:27:31,434 --> 01:27:33,026
我搜过好几千人了

1641
01:28:49,178 --> 01:28:51,237
（意大利文）

1642

（黑社会大亨 维多柯里昂返家）

1648
01:32:21,591 --> 01:32:23,286
好了，转进来

1649
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:24,954
好了，你接手

1650
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,728
Okay, you take over.

1651
01:32:42,945 --> 01:32:44,572
我爱你，爷爷

1652
01:32:43,013 --> 01:32:45,072
I love you, Grandpa.

1653
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:50,542
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

1654
01:32:47,784 --> 01:32:49,547
对不起，爸，他还不认识你

1655
01:32:51,621 --> 01:32:54,715
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa. - Okay.

1656
01:32:51,654 --> 01:32:53,417
小砘铮念给爷爷听！

1657
01:32:53,523 --> 01:32:58,790
好，我祝你早日康复，爷爷 我希望能快点见到你

1658

"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

爱你的孙子，法兰克

1660
01:33:02,198 --> 01:33:03,688
多乖巧

1661
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,429
走吧！到外面去

1662
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:06,360
Go with your mother.

1663
01:33:06,402 --> 01:33:09,030
把他们带到楼下去吧！

1664
01:33:06,503 --> 01:33:08,630
Take them downstairs.

1665
01:33:11,574 --> 01:33:12,666
妈！

1666
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:17,102
Go on, Carlo, you too.

1667
01:33:14,877 --> 01:33:16,242
走吧！卡洛，你也是

1668
01:33:18,548 --> 01:33:20,243
Go on.

1669
01:33:18,614 --> 01:33:19,603
走吧

1670
01:33:23,786 --> 01:33:26,414
你要烤鸡吗？那是他最喜欢的

1671

我知道，但他能吃多少呢？

1672
01:33:40,804 --> 01:33:44,467
- What's the matter with you, Carlo? - Shut up and set the table.

1673
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:42,531
你怎么了？卡洛

1674
01:33:42,905 --> 01:33:44,304
闭嘴，去摆桌子吧！

1675
01:34:00,323 --> 01:34:06,455
Since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on our operations.

1676
01:34:00,356 --> 01:34:02,085
自从麦克劳斯基被杀后

1677
01:34:03,092 --> 01:34:06,721
警方瓦解了我们多数业务

1678
01:34:08,098 --> 01:34:12,933
And also the other families. There's been a lot of bad blood.

1679
01:34:08,197 --> 01:34:10,188
其他的家族也是一样

1680
01:34:11,567 --> 01:34:13,091
牺牲很多

1681
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:16,561
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1682
01:34:13,269 --> 01:34:14,861
他们攻击我们

1683
01:34:15,805 --> 01:34:16,863
我们反击

1684
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:21,901
Through our newspaper contacts we've been able to put out material

1685
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:21,738
透过我们报社中的连系 我们提供了不少内幕

1686
01:34:22,044 --> 01:34:25,411
很多麦克劳斯基 跟毒贩索拉索勾结的事

1687
01:34:22,045 --> 01:34:26,277
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1688
01:34:26,415 --> 01:34:28,474
所以风声已经没有那么紧了

1689
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:28,475
So things are loosening up.

1690
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:37,125
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

1691
01:34:29,886 --> 01:34:34,619
还有我派弗雷多去拉斯维加斯

1692
01:34:34,724 --> 01:34:37,420
在洛杉矶的法兰西斯科阁下 会给予他保护

1693
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:42,357
- I want him to rest. - I'm going to learn the casino business.

1694
01:34:37,526 --> 01:34:42,190
-我要他休息一会儿 -我要去学赌场的事

1695
01:34:50,073 --> 01:34:52,064
Where's Michael?

1696
01:34:50,406 --> 01:34:52,101
麦克在哪？

1697
01:35:04,187 --> 01:35:07,486
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1698
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,050
杀索拉索的是麦克

1699
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:13,221
But he's safe. We're starting to work to bring him back.

1700
01:35:09,258 --> 01:35:11,556
不过他很安全，别担心

1701
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:13,219
我们会把他弄回来的

1702
01:35:34,617 --> 01:35:36,608
你查出塔塔基利亚 躲在哪儿没？

1703
01:35:34,684 --> 01:35:39,178
Did you find out where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

1704
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,744
我要他的命！现在！

1705
01:35:39,055 --> 01:35:40,647
-听我说，山尼 -什么事？

1706
01:35:39,322 --> 01:35:42,416
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

1707
01:35:40,756 --> 01:35:42,451
现在局势才刚刚缓和下来

1708
01:35:42,559 --> 01:35:47,189
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

1709
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:43,990
你若去追塔塔基利亚

1710
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,252
又会引起一场大战的

1711
01:35:45,394 --> 01:35:47,089
等事情平静一点 让爸爸去协调

1712
01:35:47,196 --> 01:35:48,754
不，爸爸在身体好转之前 什么都不能做

1713
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:53,360
- He must get better first. I'll decide... - War is costly. We can't do business.

1714
01:35:48,831 --> 01:35:49,889
我要决定什么对我们最有利

1715
01:35:49,966 --> 01:35:51,661
好的，可是你那场火拼 使我们损失很多

1716
01:35:51,767 --> 01:35:53,359
没有任何进帐，我们不能做事

1717
01:35:53,469 --> 01:35:55,994
他们也不行，别担心

1718
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:57,303
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it! - We can't afford a stalemate.

1719
01:35:56,605 --> 01:35:58,368
-他们没有我们损失那么大 -请你别担心这点

1720
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:02,503
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard! - You're getting a great reputation!

1721
01:35:58,474 --> 01:36:00,169
我会以宰了那老混蛋来做结束

1722
01:36:00,276 --> 01:36:02,642
是，你现在名声很大 你一定很得意吧！

1723
01:36:02,645 --> 01:36:08,481
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

1724
01:36:02,745 --> 01:36:04,235
依照我叫你做的去做

1725
01:36:04,347 --> 01:36:06,315
该死的，我若有个西西里人 来当我的战略军师

1726
01:36:06,415 --> 01:36:08,178
我就不会落到这种地步了

1727
01:36:08,351 --> 01:36:10,216
爸爸有杰安可 看看我有什么？

1728
01:36:08,618 --> 01:36:10,916
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1729
01:36:14,324 --> 01:36:16,622
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1730
01:36:14,523 --> 01:36:16,320
对不起，我不是有意的

1731
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:20,930
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

1732
01:36:18,094 --> 01:36:19,959
妈妈煮了晚餐，今天是星期天

1733
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:26,168
Niggers are having a good time with our policy banks in Harlem.

1734
01:36:21,864 --> 01:36:26,267
黑人对我们哈林区的 银行新政策非常满意

1735
01:36:26,302 --> 01:36:30,329
Driving new Cadillacs, paying 50 per cent on a bet.

1736
01:36:26,435 --> 01:36:29,370
开着新凯迪拉克 我先帮他们付一半的钱

1737
01:36:30,473 --> 01:36:33,772
That's because they've started making big money.

1738
01:36:30,573 --> 01:36:32,871
从他们开始赚钱时 我就知道这会发生

1739
01:36:33,809 --> 01:36:37,040
爸爸从来不在餐桌上 当着孩子们谈他的公事

1740
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:37,346
Poppa never talked business at the table.

1741
01:36:37,346 --> 01:36:41,442
-闭嘴，康妮… -不准你叫她闭嘴，知道吗？

1742
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:41,211
- Shut up, Connie... - Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1743
01:36:41,851 --> 01:36:43,443
别干预

1744
01:36:42,218 --> 01:36:43,913
Don't interfere.

1745
01:36:45,288 --> 01:36:49,349
I'd like to talk to you after dinner. I could do more for the family...

1746
01:36:45,488 --> 01:36:48,116
山尼、汤姆 吃过饭后，我想与你们谈谈

1747
01:36:48,224 --> 01:36:51,421
-我对家族也许能帮很多的… -我们不在餐桌上讨论公事

1748
01:36:49,492 --> 01:36:52,461
We don't discuss business at the table.

1749
01:37:39,408 --> 01:37:41,171
我向你致敬，汤马西诺阁下

1750
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:41,877
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

1751
01:37:45,481 --> 01:37:46,539
麦克

1752
01:37:47,784 --> 01:37:49,775
Why are you so far from the house?

1753
01:37:47,883 --> 01:37:50,147
你为何离房子那么远？

1754
01:37:50,453 --> 01:37:52,683
You know I'm responsible to your father for your life.

1755
01:37:50,519 --> 01:37:53,010
你可知万一你出了事 我要向令尊负责的

1756
01:37:52,822 --> 01:37:54,949
The bodyguards are here.

1757
01:37:53,155 --> 01:37:54,486
保镖们都在这

1758
01:37:55,091 --> 01:37:57,525
It's still dangerous...

1759
01:37:55,191 --> 01:37:57,216
还是十分危险

1760
01:37:57,593 --> 01:38:00,790
我听纽约的山提诺说的

1761
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:00,424
We've heard from Santino in New York...

1762
01:38:00,563 --> 01:38:03,896
Your enemies know you're here.

1763
01:38:01,163 --> 01:38:03,461
你的敌人知道你在这了

1764
01:38:04,033 --> 01:38:07,264
Did Santino say when I can go back?

1765
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,431
山提诺有没有说 我何时能回去？

1766
01:38:07,403 --> 01:38:09,200
Not yet.

1767
01:38:07,603 --> 01:38:09,195
还不行

1768
01:38:09,339 --> 01:38:12,172
It's out of the question.

1769
01:38:09,371 --> 01:38:12,272
目前是不可能的

1770
01:38:13,642 --> 01:38:14,802
谢谢

1771
01:38:15,078 --> 01:38:17,808
Where are you going now?

1772
01:38:15,244 --> 01:38:16,506
你现在要去哪里？

1773
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,313
柯里昂村

1774
01:38:19,215 --> 01:38:22,048
Take my car.

1775
01:38:19,482 --> 01:38:21,177
坐我的车去

1776
01:38:23,052 --> 01:38:25,316
我想走路

1777
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:25,952
I want to walk.

1778
01:38:27,556 --> 01:38:29,319
小心点

1779
01:38:28,024 --> 01:38:29,855
Be careful.

1780
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:51,345
麦克，柯里昂村到了

1781
01:39:03,293 --> 01:39:04,988
Where have all the men gone?

1782
01:39:03,526 --> 01:39:04,925
所有的男人都到哪去了？

1783
01:39:05,128 --> 01:39:07,892
They're all dead from vendettas.

1784
01:39:05,294 --> 01:39:07,319
他们全都在战争中死了

1785
01:39:09,365 --> 01:39:12,334
这里是死者的姓名

1786
01:39:10,366 --> 01:39:13,164
There are the names of the dead.

1787
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:32,419
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

1788
01:39:32,555 --> 01:39:36,958
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.! Clark Gable!

1789
01:39:37,093 --> 01:39:42,531
America! Take me to the America, G.I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

1790
01:40:00,249 --> 01:40:02,240
Mamma mia what a beauty.

1791
01:40:00,382 --> 01:40:02,748
我的老天！好一个美女

1792
01:40:11,461 --> 01:40:13,861
I think you got hit by the thunderbolt.

1793
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,085
你好像中邪了一样

1794
01:40:18,935 --> 01:40:24,100
In Sicily women are more dangerous than shotguns.

1795
01:40:19,034 --> 01:40:20,058
麦克

1796
01:40:20,536 --> 01:40:24,267
在西西里，女人比猎枪还危险

1797
01:40:47,397 --> 01:40:49,365
Did you have a good hunt?

1798
01:40:47,463 --> 01:40:49,328
打猎有收获吗？

1799
01:40:49,499 --> 01:40:52,161
You know all the girls around here?

1800
01:40:49,665 --> 01:40:54,864
你认识这一带所有的女孩吗？

1801
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:54,792
We saw some real beauties.

1802
01:40:54,937 --> 01:40:59,374
One of them struck our friend like a thunderbolt.

1803
01:40:55,037 --> 01:40:58,336
我们看到几位真正的美人

1804
01:41:01,611 --> 01:41:05,672
She would tempt the devil himself.

1805
01:41:01,744 --> 01:41:05,646
其中一位让我们的朋友触电了

1806
01:41:05,881 --> 01:41:08,247
她可真够骚了

1807
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:12,309
她全身上下都很美

1808
01:41:11,287 --> 01:41:14,723
Really put together.

1809
01:41:18,094 --> 01:41:21,257
Such hair, such mouth!

1810
01:41:19,161 --> 01:41:22,562
那么漂亮的头发、嘴

1811
01:41:23,232 --> 01:41:26,861
The girls around here are beautiful... but virtuous.

1812
01:41:23,299 --> 01:41:26,928
这一带的女孩都很美 而且很贞洁

1813
01:41:27,003 --> 01:41:29,597
This one had a purple dress...

1814
01:41:27,036 --> 01:41:29,664
这个穿着紫色衣服

1815
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:32,435
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

1816
01:41:29,772 --> 01:41:31,967
头发上绑着紫色的缎带

1817
01:41:32,575 --> 01:41:36,705
A type more Greek than Italian.

1818
01:41:32,641 --> 01:41:38,238
看起来像希腊人而非意大利人

1819
01:41:38,347 --> 01:41:41,077
Do you know her?

1820
01:41:38,647 --> 01:41:40,979
你认识她吗？

1821
01:41:42,151 --> 01:41:43,584
不认识

1822
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,921
There's no girl like that in this town.

1823
01:41:44,586 --> 01:41:48,317
在本镇没有那样子的女孩

1824
01:41:49,926 --> 01:41:52,656
My God, I understand!

1825
01:41:50,025 --> 01:41:51,993
我的天！我明白了

1826
01:41:55,831 --> 01:41:56,889
有什么不对了？

1827
01:41:55,898 --> 01:41:58,059
What's wrong?

1828
01:41:59,535 --> 01:42:01,435
Let's go.

1829
01:41:59,635 --> 01:42:00,727
我们走

1830
01:42:02,338 --> 01:42:03,737
It's his daughter.

1831
01:42:02,538 --> 01:42:03,698
是他女儿

1832
01:42:03,872 --> 01:42:04,896
叫他出来

1833
01:42:03,873 --> 01:42:06,205
Tell him to come here.

1834
01:42:08,511 --> 01:42:10,069
Call him.

1835
01:42:30,132 --> 01:42:32,760
Fabrizio, you translate.

1836
01:42:30,265 --> 01:42:32,756
法布利奇欧，你翻译

1837
01:42:32,935 --> 01:42:33,924
是的，先生

1838
01:42:36,472 --> 01:42:39,373
I apologise if I offended you.

1839
01:42:36,572 --> 01:42:38,836
我若冒犯了你，我道歉

1840
01:42:39,509 --> 01:42:42,672
I'm a stranger in this country.

1841
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:41,369
我初到贵地

1842
01:42:42,778 --> 01:42:45,474
我无意冒犯你和令媛

1843
01:42:42,812 --> 01:42:46,270
I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter.

1844
01:42:51,454 --> 01:42:54,685
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

1845
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,579
我是个美国人 到西西里来避风头

1846
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:57,989
My name is Michael Corleone.

1847
01:42:55,858 --> 01:42:57,485
我的名字是麦克柯里昂

1848
01:42:59,896 --> 01:43:03,992
There are people who'd pay a lot of money for that information.

1849
01:43:00,162 --> 01:43:03,563
有人会为了钱 而出卖我在此的消息

1850
01:43:06,302 --> 01:43:09,362
But then your daughter would lose a father...

1851
01:43:06,402 --> 01:43:08,427
但那样令媛会失去父亲

1852
01:43:10,873 --> 01:43:13,706
...instead of gaining a husband.

1853
01:43:10,973 --> 01:43:12,736
而不是得到一位丈夫

1854
01:43:21,517 --> 01:43:23,007
我想认识你女儿

1855
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:24,281
I want to meet your daughter.

1856
01:43:24,219 --> 01:43:26,187
但要在你的同意下

1857
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:28,982
With your permission, and under the supervision of your family.

1858
01:43:26,455 --> 01:43:28,548
及在你的家人的监督之下

1859
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:31,524
With all respect.

1860
01:43:29,925 --> 01:43:31,756
我绝对是诚心诚意

1861
01:43:37,599 --> 01:43:44,630
星期天早上到我家来 我叫维提

1862
01:43:37,633 --> 01:43:43,230
Come to my house Sunday morning. My name is Vitelli.

1863
01:43:46,175 --> 01:43:47,540
谢谢

1864
01:43:47,777 --> 01:43:50,974
What's her name?

1865
01:43:47,943 --> 01:43:49,740
她叫什么名字？

1866
01:43:49,978 --> 01:43:51,240
艾波洛妮亚

1867
01:43:52,714 --> 01:43:53,874
很美的名字

1868
01:44:46,168 --> 01:44:48,534
这是小女艾波洛妮亚

1869
01:44:48,804 --> 01:44:52,331
这位是麦克柯里昂先生

1870
01:45:09,224 --> 01:45:10,521
谢谢

1871
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:45,586
等我回来干你

1872
01:46:43,853 --> 01:46:46,014
I'll knock you dizzy.

1873
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,125
废话少说

1874
01:46:51,761 --> 01:46:53,854
Save it for the library.

1875
01:46:57,333 --> 01:46:59,961
We've got to pick up my sister.

1876
01:46:57,599 --> 01:46:59,897
来吧！我们得去接我妹妹

1877
01:47:18,187 --> 01:47:19,745
What's the matter?

1878
01:47:18,253 --> 01:47:19,311
怎么了？

1879
01:47:22,391 --> 01:47:24,188
What's the matter?

1880
01:47:22,457 --> 01:47:23,549
怎么了？

1881
01:47:25,961 --> 01:47:28,225
- It was my fault! - Where is he?

1882
01:47:26,028 --> 01:47:27,427
-是我的错 -他在哪？

1883
01:47:27,529 --> 01:47:29,326
山尼，拜托，是我的错

1884
01:47:28,364 --> 01:47:31,197
It was my fault. I hit him.

1885
01:47:29,431 --> 01:47:31,729
山尼，是我的错 是我先开始打他的！

1886
01:47:31,333 --> 01:47:35,099
I started a fight with him. I hit him, so he hit me...

1887
01:47:31,867 --> 01:47:34,768
求你，山尼，我先打他的

1888
01:47:35,003 --> 01:47:36,971
-我… -好了

1889
01:47:39,341 --> 01:47:43,277
I'm just going to get a doctor to take a look at you.

1890
01:47:39,675 --> 01:47:43,406
我只是叫医生来看你，好吗？

1891
01:47:43,412 --> 01:47:46,404
Sonny, please don't do anything.

1892
01:47:43,578 --> 01:47:46,046
山尼，求你别动手

1893
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:50,041
What's the matter with you? What am I going to do?

1894
01:47:48,183 --> 01:47:49,946
好，你是怎么了？ 我会怎么做？

1895
01:47:50,186 --> 01:47:53,053
Make that baby an orphan before he's born?

1896
01:47:50,318 --> 01:47:54,220
我会让你肚里的孩子 做遗腹子吗？

1897
01:47:56,525 --> 01:47:57,685
好了吗？

1898
01:47:57,693 --> 01:48:00,491
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

1899
01:47:57,793 --> 01:48:00,159
这些砘锇蜒蠡队打得惨兮兮

1900
01:48:01,029 --> 01:48:02,792
叫他们不要再接受投注了

1901
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:04,329
Tell them to stop taking in action.

1902
01:48:04,466 --> 01:48:06,263
We lost enough money last week.

1903
01:48:04,499 --> 01:48:06,364
我们上周末输的钱够多了

1904
01:48:12,641 --> 01:48:15,235
卡洛，到这来…

1905
01:48:13,342 --> 01:48:14,900
Come here, come here!

1906
01:49:12,268 --> 01:49:15,635
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

1907
01:49:12,367 --> 01:49:15,768
你再碰我妹妹一下 我会杀了你

1908
01:49:31,186 --> 01:49:36,180
（意大利文）

1909
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:13,035
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay. You should call.

1910
01:53:08,903 --> 01:53:13,067
没想到你会来，凯 怎么不先打个电话来

1911
01:53:13,175 --> 01:53:17,509
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

1912
01:53:13,241 --> 01:53:16,972
我有打，我写过信也打过电话

1913
01:53:17,645 --> 01:53:19,340
我要和麦克连络

1914
01:53:17,646 --> 01:53:21,412
- I want to reach Michael. - Nobody knows where he is.

1915
01:53:19,981 --> 01:53:21,312
没有人知道他在哪

1916
01:53:21,549 --> 01:53:23,414
我们知道他没事但如此而已

1917
01:53:21,550 --> 01:53:24,075
All we know is that he's all right.

1918
01:53:26,655 --> 01:53:30,352
- What was that? - An accident, but nobody was hurt.

1919
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:29,952
-怎么了？ -那是件车祸但没有人受伤

1920
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:36,730
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael. Please?

1921
01:53:31,493 --> 01:53:32,585
汤姆

1922
01:53:32,961 --> 01:53:36,397
请你把这封信交给麦克 好吗？

1923
01:53:36,865 --> 01:53:42,701
If I accepted that, a court could prove I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1924
01:53:37,098 --> 01:53:42,331
我若接受了 法院可以证实我晓得他在哪里

1925
01:53:42,604 --> 01:53:44,970
你有耐心点，凯 他会与你连络的，好吗？

1926
01:53:42,838 --> 01:53:44,897
He'll get in touch with you.

1927
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,840
I let my cab go, so can I call another one, please?

1928
01:53:45,073 --> 01:53:48,270
我让我的计程车走了 我是否能进去打电话叫一辆？

1929
01:53:48,977 --> 01:53:50,239

1930
01:53:48,977 --> 01:53:50,842

1931
01:54:07,829 --> 01:54:13,426
- Hello? - Is Carlo there?

1935
01:54:16,038 --> 01:54:19,769
Tell him that I can't make it tonight until later.

1936
01:54:16,271 --> 01:54:19,001
你告诉他我今晚没空

1937
01:54:25,247 --> 01:54:26,509
Bitch!

1938

贱人

1939
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:31,141
- Dinner's on the table. - I'm not hungry.

1940
01:54:28,683 --> 01:54:30,776
-晚餐在桌上了 -我还不饿

1941
01:54:31,286 --> 01:54:34,551
- The food is getting cold. - I'll eat out later.

1942
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:33,947
-晚餐在桌上快凉了 -我有约了

1943
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:37,750
You just told me to make you dinner!

1944
01:54:34,722 --> 01:54:36,383

-滚开好吗？ -你才滚开

1946
01:54:45,467 --> 01:54:48,265
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

1947
01:54:45,733 --> 01:54:48,293
你这个意大利婊子

1948
01:54:52,574 --> 01:54:53,734
好，全都打破了！

1949
01:54:52,574 --> 01:54:56,943
That's it, break it all, you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

1950
01:54:53,842 --> 01:54:56,208
你这被宠坏的女娃！ 全打破了！

1951
01:55:06,121 --> 01:55:10,319
你为何不把那个妓女 带回家吃晚饭？

1952
01:55:06,121 --> 01:55:10,387
Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?

1953
01:55:10,458 --> 01:55:11,755
也许我会，有何不可？

1954
01:55:10,525 --> 01:55:12,186
Maybe I will.

1955

来！杀我！ 像你爸一样当凶手！

1971
01:55:44,726 --> 01:55:46,819
- All you Corleones are murderers! - I hate you!

1972
01:55:44,859 --> 01:55:47,225
来吧！ 你们姓柯里昂的全是凶手

1973
01:55:46,962 --> 01:55:49,760
Come on, kill me!

- I hate you! - Now I'll kill you.

1979
01:55:56,538 --> 01:55:58,130
你这意大利贱货

1980
01:55:56,672 --> 01:55:59,903
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

1981
01:55:58,306 --> 01:55:59,739

Connie, what's the matter? I can't hear you.

1986
01:56:11,486 --> 01:56:13,317
我听不见你说的，什么事？

1987
01:56:14,022 --> 01:56:16,957
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

1988
01:56:14,055 --> 01:56:16,683
康妮，说大声点，孩子在哭

1989
01:56:17,092 --> 01:56:20,027
Santino, I can't understand. I don't know.

1990
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:19,855
山提诺，我听不懂，我不明白

1991
01:56:21,263 --> 01:56:23,026
Yeah, Connie.

1992

什么事？康妮？

1993

Son-of-a-bitch.

01:56:46,721 --> 01:56:49,485
快开门，站起来

2003
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:58,959
Sonny!

2004
01:56:57,865 --> 01:56:59,059

01:57:08,744 --> 01:57:10,735
Go after him, go on!

2009
01:57:40,208 --> 01:57:42,574
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

2010
01:57:40,241 --> 01:57:43,870
王八蛋，快点…

2011
01:59:31,052 --> 01:59:32,280
把那个给我

2012
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:33,383
Give me a drop.

2013
01:59:41,229 --> 01:59:43,789
My wife is crying upstairs.

2014
01:59:41,329 --> 01:59:43,559
我太太在楼上哭

2015
01:59:45,934 --> 01:59:48,664
I hear cars coming to the house.

2016
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,696
我听见车子到家里来

2017
01:59:52,941 --> 01:59:56,104
Consigliere of mine,

2018
01:59:53,141 --> 01:59:55,268
我的好军师

2019
01:59:56,244 --> 01:59:59,475
tell your Don what everyone seems to know.

2020
01:59:56,444 --> 01:59:59,572
所有人都知道 只有我毫不知情

2021
01:59:59,614 --> 02:00:01,980
I didn't tell Mama anything.

2022
01:59:59,947 --> 02:00:01,938
我没告诉妈任何事

2023
02:00:03,084 --> 02:00:06,815
I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.

2024
02:00:03,217 --> 02:00:06,050
我正预备去叫醒你，并告诉你

2025
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:11,884
But you needed a drink first.

2026
02:00:09,857 --> 02:00:11,950
但你需要先喝杯酒

2027
02:00:14,596 --> 02:00:15,824
Yeah.

2028
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:21,291
Well, now you've had your drink.

2029
02:00:18,866 --> 02:00:20,527
现在你喝过酒了

2030
02:00:26,875 --> 02:00:31,244
They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead.

2031
02:00:26,908 --> 02:00:29,274
他们在收费站杀了山尼

2032
02:00:30,111 --> 02:00:31,237
他死了

2033
02:00:48,363 --> 02:00:51,298
I want no inquiries made.

2034
02:00:48,396 --> 02:00:50,990
我不要追查此事

2035
02:00:55,003 --> 02:00:57,528
I want no acts of vengeance.

2036
02:00:55,069 --> 02:00:57,299
我不要复仇

2037
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,873
I want you to arrange a meeting...

02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:00,869
我要你安排一次会议

2039
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:05,003
与五大家族的族长

2040
02:01:02,944 --> 02:01:05,913
...with the heads of the five families.

2041
02:01:07,549 --> 02:01:09,915
This war stops now.

2042
02:01:07,715 --> 02:01:09,774
这场火拼该终止了

2043
02:01:31,439 --> 02:01:33,304
打电话给包纳萨拉

2044
02:01:31,539 --> 02:01:34,007
Call Bonasera.

2045

我现在需要他了

2047
02:01:48,523 --> 02:01:53,620
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for Vito Corleone, at his request.

2048
02:01:48,723 --> 02:01:49,985
我是汤姆哈金

2049
02:01:50,157 --> 02:01:52,853
维多柯里昂要我打这个电话

2050
02:01:53,762 --> 02:01:56,094
You owe your Don a service.

2051
02:01:53,828 --> 02:01:55,853
你欠教父一次人情

2052
02:01:56,231 --> 02:01:59,860
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

2053
02:01:56,430 --> 02:01:59,558
他相信你会回报他的

2054
02:01:59,967 --> 02:02:02,527
他在一小时后 会到你的殡仪馆去

2055
02:02:00,001 --> 02:02:04,529
He will be at your funeral parlour in one hour. Be there to greet him.

2056

请在那等待

2057
02:02:25,493 --> 02:02:30,260
Well, my friend, are you ready to do me this service?

2058
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:27,025
我的朋友

2059
02:02:27,962 --> 02:02:30,089
你预备为我服务了吗？

2060
02:02:30,398 --> 02:02:33,890
Yes. What do you want me to do?

2061
02:02:30,431 --> 02:02:33,889
是的，但你要我怎么做？

2062
02:02:41,842 --> 02:02:47,280
我要你尽你一切的力量和技巧 好好为他化妆

2063
02:02:41,876 --> 02:02:46,711
I want you to use all your powers and all your skills.

2064
02:02:50,585 --> 02:02:53,645

2065
02:02:50,585 --> 02:02:53,679
I don't want his mother to see him this way.

2066
02:03:09,604 --> 02:03:12,698
Look how they massacred my boy.

2067
02:03:09,704 --> 02:03:12,195
看看他们是怎么对我的孩子？

2068
02:03:42,937 --> 02:03:45,098
It's safer to teach you English!

2069
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:47,234
-教你英文会安全一点 -我会英文，星期一

2070
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:46,639
I know English...

2071
02:03:46,775 --> 02:03:52,270
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

2072
02:03:47,408 --> 02:03:49,239
星期二、星期四、星期三

2073
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:53,005
-星期五、星期日、星期六 -好极了！

2074
02:03:59,621 --> 02:04:01,953
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

2075
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:04,752
How are things in Palermo?

2076
02:04:07,628 --> 02:04:09,493
你好，汤马西诺阁下

2077
02:04:09,864 --> 02:04:16,099
Michael is teaching me to drive... watch, I'll show you.

2078
02:04:09,964 --> 02:04:13,400
麦克在教我开车

2079
02:04:13,868 --> 02:04:15,927
我开给你看

2080
02:04:16,237 --> 02:04:18,899
How are things in Palermo?

2081
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:18,304
家里的一切都还好吧？

2082
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:22,032
Young people don't respect anything any more...

2083
02:04:19,073 --> 02:04:21,541
年轻人不再尊重任何事了

2084
02:04:22,177 --> 02:04:25,203
times are changing for the worse.

2085
02:04:22,209 --> 02:04:24,837
时代越变越糟

2086
02:04:27,048 --> 02:04:34,420
这地方对你已变得太危险了

2087
02:04:27,081 --> 02:04:34,351
This place has become too dangerous for you.

2088
02:04:34,489 --> 02:04:41,588
I want you to move to a villa near Siracusa... right now.

2089
02:04:34,588 --> 02:04:41,960
我要你搬到西拉古莎 附近的别墅

2090
02:04:45,166 --> 02:04:47,828
What's wrong?

2091
02:04:45,299 --> 02:04:47,665
有什么不对了？

2092
02:04:47,969 --> 02:04:51,700
Bad news from America.

2093
02:04:48,035 --> 02:04:50,799
由美国传来的坏消息

2094
02:04:51,839 --> 02:04:56,833
你哥哥山尼，他们杀了他！

2095
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:56,743
Your brother, Santino, they killed him.

2096
02:05:01,782 --> 02:05:06,082
我们走了！你答应的

2097
02:05:01,783 --> 02:05:05,241
Let's go... you promised.

2098
02:05:23,972 --> 02:05:26,702
Get the car.

2099
02:05:24,004 --> 02:05:25,471
-法布利奇欧！ -什么事？

2100
02:05:25,573 --> 02:05:26,938
备车

2101
02:05:27,441 --> 02:05:29,170
你要自己开吗？老板

2102
02:05:27,575 --> 02:05:31,568
Are you driving yourself, Boss? Is your wife coming with you?

2103
02:05:29,243 --> 02:05:30,175
是的

2104
02:05:30,244 --> 02:05:31,734
你太太跟你一起去吗？

2105
02:05:31,713 --> 02:05:35,240
No, take her to her father's house until things are safe.

2106
02:05:31,846 --> 02:05:34,940
不，我要你送她回娘家 等一切安全点再说

2107
02:05:35,383 --> 02:05:37,783
Okay, anything you say.

2108
02:05:35,483 --> 02:05:37,007
好的，随你吩咐，老板

2109
02:05:43,625 --> 02:05:46,093
Calo, where is Apollonia?

2110
02:05:43,724 --> 02:05:45,487
卡罗，艾波洛妮亚呢？

2111
02:05:46,227 --> 02:05:50,357
She's going to surprise you. She wants to drive.

2112
02:05:46,327 --> 02:05:50,161
她想给你个惊喜，她要开车

2113
02:05:52,033 --> 02:05:54,934
She'll make a good American wife.

2114
02:05:52,099 --> 02:05:54,761
她会当个好的美国太太

2115
02:05:55,703 --> 02:05:57,466
等一下，我去拿行李

2116
02:05:55,937 --> 02:05:57,996
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

2117
02:06:07,949 --> 02:06:10,281
Fabrizio!

2118
02:06:08,048 --> 02:06:09,310
法布利奇欧

2119
02:06:10,418 --> 02:06:12,886
Where are you going?

2120
02:06:10,518 --> 02:06:11,610
你要去哪？

2121
02:06:13,021 --> 02:06:16,548
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

2122
02:06:13,053 --> 02:06:16,545
麦克，在那等，我开过去

2123
02:06:22,096 --> 02:06:23,427
No, Apollonia!

2124
02:06:22,129 --> 02:06:24,154
不！艾波洛妮亚…

2125
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:47,812
巴西尼阁下

2126
02:06:46,754 --> 02:06:52,351
Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organise this meeting,

2127
02:06:47,922 --> 02:06:51,824
谢谢你帮我安排这次会议

2128
02:06:52,493 --> 02:06:57,658
and the other heads of the five families from New York and New Jersey.

2129
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:57,663
还有纽约和新泽西 其他五大家族的族长

2130
02:06:59,267 --> 02:07:02,327
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

2131
02:06:59,366 --> 02:07:02,096
布朗区的卡麦克里安诺

2132
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:05,803
and from Brooklyn...

2133
02:07:02,536 --> 02:07:05,835
以及…布鲁克林的

2134
02:07:07,542 --> 02:07:09,635
...Philip Tattaglia.

2135
02:07:07,608 --> 02:07:09,303
菲立浦塔塔基利亚

2136
02:07:11,145 --> 02:07:14,171
And from Staten Island

2137
02:07:11,245 --> 02:07:13,179
由史坦登岛来的

2138
02:07:14,315 --> 02:07:17,443
维多史特基

2139
02:07:14,315 --> 02:07:17,478
we have with us Victor Strachi.

2140
02:07:17,618 --> 02:07:23,523
And the other associates that came as far as from California and Kansas City

2141
02:07:17,685 --> 02:07:23,055
及由加州堪萨斯来的同道

2142
02:07:23,457 --> 02:07:25,925
以及全国其他各地区 所来的朋友

2143
02:07:23,658 --> 02:07:27,389
and all the other territories of the country. Thank you.

2144
02:07:26,193 --> 02:07:27,558
谢谢你们

2145
02:07:34,002 --> 02:07:37,460
How did things ever get so far?

2146
02:07:34,168 --> 02:07:36,295
事情怎么会演变成如此？

2147
02:07:37,605 --> 02:07:39,232
I don't know.

2148
02:07:37,638 --> 02:07:38,935
我不晓得

2149
02:07:41,242 --> 02:07:45,178
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

2150
02:07:41,275 --> 02:07:45,268
是那么的不幸及那么的没必要

2151
02:07:47,715 --> 02:07:51,845
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

2152
02:07:47,915 --> 02:07:49,883
塔塔基利亚失去了一个儿子

2153
02:07:50,217 --> 02:07:51,809
我也是

2154
02:07:53,721 --> 02:07:54,881
我们该停手了

2155
02:07:53,755 --> 02:07:57,088
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

2156
02:07:54,989 --> 02:07:56,854
若是塔塔基利亚同意

2157
02:07:57,225 --> 02:08:01,218
then I'm willing to let things go on as before.

2158
02:07:57,291 --> 02:08:01,523
我愿意让事情恢复以前的局面

2159
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:06,257
We're grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting.

2160
02:08:02,796 --> 02:08:05,663
我们都很感谢柯里昂阁下 召开这次会议

2161
02:08:06,401 --> 02:08:11,737
We all know him as a man of his word. A modest man who listens to reason.

2162
02:08:06,433 --> 02:08:08,333
我们都了解他是个有信用的人

2163
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:11,795
他为人谦虚，总是能讲道理

2164
02:08:11,873 --> 02:08:15,866
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

2165
02:08:11,906 --> 02:08:13,567
是的，巴西尼阁下

2166
02:08:14,074 --> 02:08:15,598
他太谦虚了

2167
02:08:16,010 --> 02:08:20,208
He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.

2168
02:08:16,043 --> 02:08:19,604
所有的法官与政客 没有不听他指示的

2169
02:08:20,348 --> 02:08:23,215
He refused to share them.

2170
02:08:20,447 --> 02:08:22,312
他却拒绝与我们分享

2171
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:26,751
我何时拒绝过与大家分享？

2172
02:08:23,351 --> 02:08:27,082
When did I ever refuse an accommodation?

2173
02:08:27,221 --> 02:08:28,848
在座的全都认识我

2174
02:08:27,221 --> 02:08:29,519
All of you know me.

2175
02:08:30,525 --> 02:08:35,690
When did I ever refuse, except one time? And why?

2176
02:08:30,624 --> 02:08:33,684
除了一次以外 我何时拒绝过？

2177
02:08:34,795 --> 02:08:36,160
你们知道为什么

2178
02:08:37,364 --> 02:08:42,267
因为我相信毒品生意 在往后几年会毁了我们

2179
02:08:37,365 --> 02:08:43,099
Because I believe this drug business will destroy us in the years to come.

2180
02:08:43,237 --> 02:08:47,071
It's not like gambling or liquor or even women,

2181
02:08:43,304 --> 02:08:47,536
这不像赌、酒和女人

2182
02:08:47,208 --> 02:08:53,511
which is something that most people want, but is forbidden by the Church.

2183
02:08:47,675 --> 02:08:53,477
这些是人们想要的东西 只是教会不准我们做而已

2184
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:58,244
即使警察过去在赌博等方面 愿意协助我们

2185
02:08:53,648 --> 02:08:58,176
Even the police that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things

2186
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:02,653
are going to refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics.

2187
02:08:58,385 --> 02:09:01,718
但一提到毒品 他们会拒绝帮忙

2188
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:07,784
I believed that then... and I believe that now.

2189
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:07,657
我以前那么想 现在想法依然不变

2190
02:09:07,929 --> 02:09:10,056
Times have changed.

2191
02:09:08,062 --> 02:09:09,586
时代变了

2192
02:09:10,198 --> 02:09:14,931
It's not like the old days, when we could do anything we wanted.

2193
02:09:10,297 --> 02:09:12,060
不像昔日了

2194
02:09:12,566 --> 02:09:14,329
我们能做任何我们想做的事

2195
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:17,936
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

2196
02:09:15,135 --> 02:09:17,228
你拒绝合作实在不够朋友

2197
02:09:18,072 --> 02:09:21,803
柯里昂阁下握有全纽约 法律界以及政客的势力

2198
02:09:18,072 --> 02:09:23,476
If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians, then he must share them

2199
02:09:22,142 --> 02:09:23,609
他就必须与大家分享

2200
02:09:23,611 --> 02:09:28,480
or let others use them. He must let us draw the water from the well.

2201
02:09:23,777 --> 02:09:24,971
让大家都能利用他们

2202
02:09:25,212 --> 02:09:28,340
他必须让我们分汲利益 大家一起发财

2203
02:09:29,217 --> 02:09:32,778
Certainly he can present a bill for such services.

2204
02:09:29,249 --> 02:09:32,446
当然他能因这种服务 而向大家收费

2205
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:35,821
After all, we're not communists.

2206
02:09:32,953 --> 02:09:35,888
毕竟我们不是共产党

2207
02:09:38,659 --> 02:09:41,685
I also don't believe in drugs.

2208
02:09:38,726 --> 02:09:40,819
我同样的也不相信毒品

2209
02:09:41,829 --> 02:09:46,493
For years I paid my people extra, so they wouldn't do that kind of business.

2210
02:09:41,862 --> 02:09:44,228
多年来我付手下优厚的待遇

2211
02:09:44,331 --> 02:09:46,424
使他们不去沾毒品

2212
02:09:46,634 --> 02:09:49,797
Somebody says to them "I have powders."

2213
02:09:46,867 --> 02:09:49,802
避免有人来找他们 并且说我有白粉

2214
02:09:49,903 --> 02:09:52,895
你只要投资三千元到四千元

2215
02:09:49,937 --> 02:09:56,365
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment, we can make 50,000 distributing."

2216
02:09:53,741 --> 02:09:56,266
就可以赚到五万元

2217
02:09:57,411 --> 02:10:03,179
They can't resist. I want to control it as a business, keep it respectable.

2218
02:09:57,478 --> 02:09:59,002
他们怎能抗拒得了

2219
02:09:59,146 --> 02:10:03,674
我想以正派的方法 来经营毒品生意

2220
02:10:03,851 --> 02:10:08,345
I don't want it near schools, I don't want it sold to children.

2221
02:10:03,917 --> 02:10:05,509
我不要它们接近学校

2222
02:10:05,619 --> 02:10:07,450
我不要把它们卖给孩子

2223
02:10:08,489 --> 02:10:10,457
That's an infamia.

2224
02:10:08,589 --> 02:10:10,284
那是残害幼苗

2225
02:10:11,492 --> 02:10:15,451
In my city we would keep the traffic to the coloured.

2226
02:10:11,625 --> 02:10:15,356
我只想卖给那些黑人 或是在有色人种中流通

2227
02:10:15,596 --> 02:10:18,565
They're animals, so let them lose their souls.

2228
02:10:15,629 --> 02:10:18,826
他们反正是动物 所以让他们去坠落吧

2229
02:10:25,373 --> 02:10:29,309
I hoped that we could come here and reason together.

2230
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:28,931
我本希望能合理的讨论一些事

2231
02:10:30,378 --> 02:10:37,307
And I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to find a peaceful solution.

2232
02:10:30,444 --> 02:10:31,877
身为一个讲道理的人

2233
02:10:31,979 --> 02:10:37,349
我愿意为此事 找个和平解决之道

2234
02:10:37,451 --> 02:10:41,945
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled.

2235
02:10:37,651 --> 02:10:39,016
那么我们全都达成协议

2236
02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:42,020
毒品生意可以做但要有限制

2237
02:10:42,089 --> 02:10:46,526
Don Corleone will give us protection in the east, and there will be peace.

2238
02:10:42,156 --> 02:10:44,716
柯里昂阁下会给我们 东部的保护

2239
02:10:45,159 --> 02:10:46,717
然后我们和平相处

2240
02:10:46,661 --> 02:10:50,324
I must have strict assurance from Corleone.

2241
02:10:46,827 --> 02:10:49,819
但我必须有柯里昂阁下的 确切保证

2242
02:10:50,464 --> 02:10:53,797
As time goes by and his position becomes stronger,

2243
02:10:50,564 --> 02:10:53,795
万一他的地位越来越坚固之后

2244
02:10:53,901 --> 02:10:56,335
他是否会采取复仇行动

2245
02:10:53,935 --> 02:10:56,165
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

2246
02:10:56,304 --> 02:11:01,970
We are all reasonable men. We don't have to give assurances.

2247
02:10:56,437 --> 02:10:58,371
听着我们这全是讲理的人

2248
02:10:58,605 --> 02:11:01,335
我们不需像是律师般 给什么确切保证

2249
02:11:02,042 --> 02:11:03,805
你谈到复仇

2250
02:11:02,109 --> 02:11:04,270
You talk about vengeance.

2251
02:11:04,412 --> 02:11:07,643
Will vengeance bring your son back to you?

2252
02:11:04,812 --> 02:11:07,508
复仇会让你的儿子复活吗？

2253
02:11:07,782 --> 02:11:10,580
Or my boy to me?

2254
02:11:08,148 --> 02:11:09,809
或者我的儿子？

2255
02:11:10,718 --> 02:11:13,619
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

2256
02:11:10,751 --> 02:11:13,481
我不会再去计较我儿子的死

2257
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:18,722
但我有个自私的要求

2258
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:18,824
But I have selfish reasons.

2259
02:11:20,895 --> 02:11:24,888
My youngest son was forced to leave this country...

2260
02:11:20,961 --> 02:11:25,193
我的小儿子被迫离开这个国家

2261
02:11:26,367 --> 02:11:28,995
...because of this Sollozzo business.

2262
02:11:26,533 --> 02:11:28,558
全都因为这索拉索的事

2263
02:11:29,503 --> 02:11:34,338
我必须安排让他安全的回来

2264
02:11:30,705 --> 02:11:34,197
And I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely.

2265
02:11:34,342 --> 02:11:37,140
Cleared of all these false charges.

2266
02:11:34,508 --> 02:11:36,999
洗脱种种无中生有的罪名

2267
02:11:38,579 --> 02:11:41,639
But I'm a superstitious man.

2268
02:11:38,612 --> 02:11:40,910
而我是个迷信的人

2269
02:11:41,782 --> 02:11:48,381
If an unlucky accident should befall him, if he should be shot by a police officer,

2270
02:11:41,882 --> 02:11:43,611
若是他不幸发生意外

2271
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:47,413
或被警察开枪打死

2272
02:11:48,522 --> 02:11:52,083
or if he should hang himself in his jail cell,

2273
02:11:48,589 --> 02:11:51,752
或在牢里上吊

2274
02:11:52,226 --> 02:11:54,956
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

2275
02:11:52,259 --> 02:11:55,126
或是他被闪电击中

2276
02:11:56,330 --> 02:11:59,822
then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room.

2277
02:11:56,396 --> 02:11:59,627
那我会怪罪于 在这房间内的诸位

2278
02:12:01,502 --> 02:12:03,834
And that I do not forgive.

2279
02:12:01,602 --> 02:12:03,900
到那时候我就不会再客气了

2280
02:12:06,374 --> 02:12:08,740
But, that aside...

2281
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:08,874
但除了那个以外

2282
02:12:11,846 --> 02:12:14,212
...let me say that I swear...

2283
02:12:11,879 --> 02:12:17,943
我以我孙子的性命发誓

2284
02:12:15,783 --> 02:12:18,911
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

2285
02:12:19,053 --> 02:12:23,012
that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today.

2286
02:12:19,153 --> 02:12:22,816
我不会是打破 我们今天和议的人

2287
02:12:48,883 --> 02:12:54,287
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's drug middlemen have clean records?

2288
02:12:48,949 --> 02:12:50,712
当我见塔塔基利亚的人时

2289
02:12:50,884 --> 02:12:53,682
应否坚持那些毒品中间人 都没有前科？

2290
02:12:54,422 --> 02:12:56,947
Mention it. Don't insist.

2291
02:12:54,521 --> 02:12:56,386
提出来无妨，不要坚持

2292
02:12:58,659 --> 02:13:03,562
- Barzini will know without being told. - You mean Tattaglia.

2293
02:12:58,692 --> 02:13:01,525
巴西尼这种人你不说他也明白

2294
02:13:02,596 --> 02:13:03,790
你是说塔塔基利亚

2295
02:13:05,266 --> 02:13:10,465
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino.

2296
02:13:05,399 --> 02:13:07,162
塔塔基利亚是个下三滥？

2297
02:13:08,268 --> 02:13:10,896
他根本没本事干掉山提诺

2298
02:13:13,941 --> 02:13:19,937
But I didn't know until this day that it was Barzini all along.

2299
02:13:13,974 --> 02:13:16,670
我在今天以前并不晓得

2300
02:13:17,811 --> 02:13:19,642
一直是巴西尼在主使

2301
02:13:34,795 --> 02:13:36,888
Come on, Nancy.

2302
02:13:34,962 --> 02:13:36,361
来吧！南西

2303
02:13:38,099 --> 02:13:40,659
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

2304
02:13:38,165 --> 02:13:40,690
大家紧跟在一起，布莱恩

2305
02:13:42,002 --> 02:13:44,061
Okay, all right.

2306
02:13:42,069 --> 02:13:43,593
好的…

2307
02:13:56,951 --> 02:13:58,543
How long have you been back?

2308
02:13:57,084 --> 02:13:58,449
你回来多久了？

2309
02:13:59,687 --> 02:14:01,518
I've been back a year.

2310
02:13:59,786 --> 02:14:00,980
一年了

2311
02:14:03,057 --> 02:14:05,719
Longer than that, I think.

2312
02:14:03,123 --> 02:14:04,454
也许还不只

2313
02:14:07,728 --> 02:14:10,060
It's good to see you, Kay.

2314
02:14:07,794 --> 02:14:09,455
见到你真好，凯

2315
02:14:21,041 --> 02:14:23,601
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

2316
02:14:21,174 --> 02:14:22,971
我现在为我父亲做事

2317
02:14:26,046 --> 02:14:29,106
He's been sick. Very sick.

2318
02:14:26,213 --> 02:14:29,239
他病了，病的很重

2319
02:14:30,718 --> 02:14:37,089
But you're not like him. You told me you weren't going to become like your father.

2320
02:14:30,784 --> 02:14:32,649
但是你不像他，麦克

2321
02:14:32,819 --> 02:14:35,344
我以为你不会成为 令尊那样的人

2322
02:14:35,455 --> 02:14:36,786
那是你所告诉我的

2323
02:14:38,492 --> 02:14:42,690
My father is no different than any other powerful man.

2324
02:14:38,558 --> 02:14:41,459
家父与其他有权的人一样

2325
02:14:42,830 --> 02:14:46,391
Any man who's responsible for other people.

2326
02:14:42,896 --> 02:14:46,662
就是那种要对其他人 负责任的人

2327
02:14:47,535 --> 02:14:49,901
Like a senator or president.

2328
02:14:47,601 --> 02:14:49,501
像是参议员或是总统

2329
02:14:49,970 --> 02:14:51,562
你知道你说这些话有多天真

2330
02:14:50,037 --> 02:14:52,437
- How naive you sound. - Why?

2331
02:14:51,672 --> 02:14:52,661
为什么？

2332
02:14:52,573 --> 02:14:55,406
They don't have men killed.

2333
02:14:52,739 --> 02:14:55,401
参议员及总统不杀人

2334
02:14:58,579 --> 02:15:00,570
Who's being naive, Kay?

2335
02:14:58,679 --> 02:15:00,306
是谁天真？凯

2336
02:15:01,849 --> 02:15:06,650
My father's way of doing things is over. Even he knows that.

2337
02:15:01,915 --> 02:15:05,146
家父做事的那一套已过时了

2338
02:15:05,319 --> 02:15:06,616
连他都晓得那一点

2339
02:15:07,655 --> 02:15:12,149
In five years the Corleone family is going to be completely legitimate.

2340
02:15:07,721 --> 02:15:08,983
我是说在五年之内

2341
02:15:09,122 --> 02:15:11,784
柯里昂家族会完全合法化

2342
02:15:13,627 --> 02:15:14,616
相信我！

2343
02:15:13,861 --> 02:15:17,820
Trust me. That's all I can tell you about my business. Kay...

2344
02:15:14,728 --> 02:15:16,855
我很清楚我未来的走向

2345
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:18,054
凯

2346
02:15:19,266 --> 02:15:23,566
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

2347
02:15:19,299 --> 02:15:21,164
麦克，你为何到这来？

2348
02:15:21,668 --> 02:15:22,692
为什么？

2349
02:15:23,704 --> 02:15:28,403
What do you want with me after all this time? I've been calling and writing.

2350
02:15:23,804 --> 02:15:25,237
你究竟想要我怎么样？

2351
02:15:25,339 --> 02:15:28,570
这么多年来 你不打电话也不写信

2352
02:15:28,542 --> 02:15:32,000
I came because I need you. I care for you.

2353
02:15:28,742 --> 02:15:31,870
我来这是因为我需要你 我关心你

2354
02:15:32,045 --> 02:15:33,205
别再说了，麦克

2355
02:15:32,146 --> 02:15:36,378
- Please stop it, Michael. - Because... I want you to marry me.

2356
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:34,779
因为…

2357
02:15:35,015 --> 02:15:36,380
我要你嫁给我

2358
02:15:37,785 --> 02:15:40,754
- It's too late. - Please, Kay...

2359
02:15:37,884 --> 02:15:39,010
太迟了…

2360
02:15:39,186 --> 02:15:40,881
凯！…

2361
02:15:42,022 --> 02:15:45,981
I'll do anything you ask to make up for what's happened to us.

2362
02:15:42,055 --> 02:15:46,219
我会做任何事 以弥补过去所发生的事

2363
02:15:47,795 --> 02:15:52,425
Because that's important, Kay. Because what's important is that...

2364
02:15:47,994 --> 02:15:50,019
因为那很重要！凯

2365
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:52,462
重要的是因为…

2366
02:15:53,601 --> 02:15:57,093
...we have each other. That we have a life together.

2367
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:54,997
我们拥有彼此

2368
02:15:55,502 --> 02:15:57,197
而且我们要共度一生

2369
02:15:58,439 --> 02:16:01,237
That we have children. Our children.

2370
02:15:58,472 --> 02:15:59,905
我们会有孩子

2371
02:16:00,107 --> 02:16:01,506
我们的孩子

2372
02:16:02,676 --> 02:16:05,236
Kay, I need you.

2373
02:16:02,776 --> 02:16:03,868
凯

2374
02:16:04,077 --> 02:16:05,840
我需要你

2375
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:08,477
而且我爱你

2376
02:16:06,914 --> 02:16:09,109
And I love you.

2377
02:16:30,471 --> 02:16:34,237
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it!

2378
02:16:30,637 --> 02:16:32,571
巴西尼的人抢我们的地盘

2379
02:16:32,672 --> 02:16:34,003
而我们却无能为力

2380
02:16:34,375 --> 02:16:37,936
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat! - Be patient.

2381
02:16:34,441 --> 02:16:37,137
再过不久布鲁克林 我连落脚的地方都没有了

2382
02:16:37,244 --> 02:16:38,233
有耐性点

2383
02:16:38,078 --> 02:16:41,138
I'm not asking for help. Just take off the handcuffs.

2384
02:16:38,378 --> 02:16:41,040
我不是求你帮忙 只是不想受制肘

2385
02:16:41,282 --> 02:16:44,581
- Be patient. - We must protect ourselves.

2386
02:16:41,348 --> 02:16:42,440
再忍耐点

2387
02:16:42,582 --> 02:16:44,174
我们必须保护自己

2388
02:16:44,484 --> 02:16:46,418
给我个机会再培养一些新人

2389
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:48,085
- Let me recruit some new men. - No.

2390
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:47,509
不！

2391
02:16:48,222 --> 02:16:52,283
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight. - Mike, you're wrong.

2392
02:16:48,288 --> 02:16:52,019
-我不要给巴西尼藉口来开战 -麦克，你错了

2393
02:16:53,427 --> 02:16:55,554
Don Corleone...

2394
02:16:53,527 --> 02:16:54,619
柯里昂阁下

2395
02:16:55,696 --> 02:16:59,757
You once said that one day Tessio and me could form our own family.

2396
02:16:55,762 --> 02:16:59,459
你曾说过要让我 与泰西欧自立门户

2397
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:04,337
Till today I would never think of it. I must ask your permission.

2398
02:16:59,933 --> 02:17:01,525
今天以前我想都不敢想

2399
02:17:01,868 --> 02:17:03,563
但现在我要求你的批准

2400
02:17:04,939 --> 02:17:07,567
Michael is now head of the family.

2401
02:17:05,005 --> 02:17:10,568
现在由麦克当家 如果他答应我就祝福你

2402
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:11,906
If he gives his permission, then you have my blessing.

2403
02:17:12,046 --> 02:17:14,344
After we make the move to Nevada

2404
02:17:12,212 --> 02:17:13,907
等我们搬到内华达州后

2405
02:17:14,481 --> 02:17:18,884
you can leave the Corleone family and go on your own.

2406
02:17:14,514 --> 02:17:17,039
你就可由柯里昂家族分出 自立门户

2407
02:17:17,717 --> 02:17:19,014
但得在我们搬到内华达州之后

2408
02:17:19,019 --> 02:17:23,319
- How long will that be? - Six months.

2409
02:17:19,186 --> 02:17:20,278
那得花多少时间？

2410
02:17:22,055 --> 02:17:23,079
六个月

2411
02:17:23,457 --> 02:17:29,657
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

2412
02:17:23,657 --> 02:17:24,681
原谅我，教父

2413
02:17:24,858 --> 02:17:26,189
但当你走了后

2414
02:17:26,626 --> 02:17:29,789
我与彼得迟早 会成为巴西尼的靶

2415
02:17:29,797 --> 02:17:35,394
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time there will be nothing left to build on.

2416
02:17:29,963 --> 02:17:31,624
我恨那该死的巴西尼

2417
02:17:31,798 --> 02:17:34,631
六个月之后 我们已经搞不出什么玩意了

2418
02:17:35,536 --> 02:17:38,403
- Do you have faith in my judgement? - Yes.

2419
02:17:35,569 --> 02:17:37,434
你对我的判断有信心吗？

2420
02:17:37,737 --> 02:17:38,761
是的

2421
02:17:38,539 --> 02:17:41,440
- Do I have your loyalty? - Always, Godfather.

2422
02:17:38,872 --> 02:17:39,861
你仍对我忠心吗？

2423
02:17:39,973 --> 02:17:41,463
是的，忠心不二，教父

2424
02:17:41,575 --> 02:17:45,306
Then be a friend to Michael. Do as he says.

2425
02:17:41,641 --> 02:17:43,268
那么就当麦克的朋友吧

2426
02:17:43,844 --> 02:17:45,402
照他所说的去做

2427
02:17:49,683 --> 02:17:54,950
Things are negotiated that'll solve your problems and answer your questions.

2428
02:17:49,816 --> 02:17:51,147
现在有些事仍在磋商

2429
02:17:51,318 --> 02:17:54,446
你们的问题和困难 全都可以得到解决

2430
02:17:55,089 --> 02:17:57,182
That's all I can tell you now.

2431
02:17:55,222 --> 02:17:56,746
目前我只能这么说

2432
02:17:58,292 --> 02:18:00,692
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

2433
02:17:58,358 --> 02:18:00,087
卡洛，你在内华达长大的

2434
02:18:00,828 --> 02:18:04,127
When we make our move there, you'll be my right-hand man.

2435
02:18:00,927 --> 02:18:03,395
当我们搬的时候 你会是我的左右手

2436
02:18:04,264 --> 02:18:09,201
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere. He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

2437
02:18:04,397 --> 02:18:06,262
汤姆哈金不再做军师了

2438
02:18:06,933 --> 02:18:08,798
他将会担任 我们在拉斯维加斯的律师

2439
02:18:09,336 --> 02:18:12,703
That's no reflection on Tom, just how I want it.

2440
02:18:09,402 --> 02:18:11,768
我对汤姆没有不满 但我不要他再当军师

2441
02:18:11,972 --> 02:18:15,601
况且有我父亲在 他可以做我最佳的军师

2442
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:17,402
If I ever need help, who's a better consigliere than my father? That's it.

2443
02:18:16,176 --> 02:18:17,268
就是这样了

2444
02:18:36,664 --> 02:18:40,293
- Thank you, Poppa. - I'm happy for you, Carlo.

2445
02:18:36,830 --> 02:18:38,855
-谢谢，爸爸 -我为你高兴，卡洛

2446
02:18:40,434 --> 02:18:43,494
Mike... Why am I out?

2447
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:43,530
麦克，我为何出局了？

2448
02:18:44,971 --> 02:18:47,405
你不适合当乱局中的军师

2449
02:18:44,972 --> 02:18:47,702
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

2450
02:18:48,976 --> 02:18:51,638
Things may get rough with the move.

2451
02:18:49,042 --> 02:18:52,273
我们一搬到内华达后 事情会变得更棘手

2452
02:18:52,312 --> 02:18:53,609
Tom.

2453
02:18:52,445 --> 02:18:53,673
汤姆

2454
02:18:58,786 --> 02:19:03,951
I advised Michael. I never thought you were a bad consigliere.

2455
02:18:58,818 --> 02:19:00,581
我向麦克建议过

2456
02:19:01,021 --> 02:19:03,546
我从未认为你不适合当军师

2457
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:09,529
I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace.

2458
02:19:04,124 --> 02:19:07,355
我认为山提诺不适合当家

2459
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:08,791
愿他安息

2460
02:19:09,663 --> 02:19:12,860
我信任麦克和你一样

2461
02:19:09,663 --> 02:19:12,894
Michael has all my confidence, just as you do.

2462
02:19:13,901 --> 02:19:19,669
But there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen.

2463
02:19:13,967 --> 02:19:15,264
但是…

2464
02:19:15,435 --> 02:19:19,394
不让你参与往后的行动 是有理由的

2465
02:19:19,807 --> 02:19:23,208
- Maybe I could help. - You're out, Tom.

2466
02:19:19,906 --> 02:19:21,464
我多少能帮得上忙

2467
02:19:21,641 --> 02:19:22,903
用不着了，汤姆

2468
02:20:12,226 --> 02:20:16,390
I can't get over the way your face looks. So good!

2469
02:20:12,292 --> 02:20:14,783
我实在无法不去注意你的脸

2470
02:20:14,961 --> 02:20:16,326
它的确看起来很棒

2471
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:21,058
This doctor did some job. Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

2472
02:20:16,596 --> 02:20:18,120
这位医生的工夫确实不错

2473
02:20:18,365 --> 02:20:19,389
是凯说服你去的吗？

2474
02:20:19,566 --> 02:20:21,932
慢着！把它们留下这

2475
02:20:21,201 --> 02:20:25,331
Leave them out here. He's tired and wants to clean up.

2476
02:20:22,102 --> 02:20:23,228
我们待会再处理它们

2477
02:20:23,403 --> 02:20:24,734
他累了，他想梳洗一下

2478
02:20:24,904 --> 02:20:26,769
好了，让我来开门，好吗？

2479
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:27,702
Let me open the door, all right?

2480
02:20:33,947 --> 02:20:39,613
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas! - All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

2481
02:20:34,214 --> 02:20:36,011
麦克！欢迎光临拉斯维加斯！

2482
02:20:36,182 --> 02:20:37,240
你认为如何？

2483
02:20:37,384 --> 02:20:39,249
全是他的主意，对吧？

2484
02:20:39,419 --> 02:20:40,579
你的哥哥弗雷多

2485
02:20:39,753 --> 02:20:42,551
- Your brother Freddy. - Girls?

2486
02:20:40,687 --> 02:20:42,120
是你弄来的女孩子，不是吗？

2487
02:20:46,093 --> 02:20:50,189
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

2488
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:49,094
我马上回来，你先招呼一下

2489
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:53,959
- Anything you want, kid, anything. - Who are the girls?

2490
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:53,490
-你要什么全都有 -那些女孩子是谁？

2491
02:20:55,235 --> 02:20:58,762
- That's for you to find out. - Get rid of them, Fredo.

2492
02:20:55,335 --> 02:20:56,768
这得要你自己去弄清楚了

2493
02:20:57,237 --> 02:20:58,636
把她们弄走，弗雷多

2494
02:21:00,006 --> 02:21:01,064
麦克

2495
02:21:00,174 --> 02:21:04,770
- Hey, Mike... - I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

2496
02:21:01,141 --> 02:21:02,301
弗雷多，我是来这公干

2497
02:21:02,475 --> 02:21:04,443
我明天就走，现在把她们弄走

2498
02:21:04,912 --> 02:21:08,211
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

2499
02:21:05,178 --> 02:21:07,738
我累了，把乐队也弄走

2500
02:21:13,487 --> 02:21:16,479
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

2501
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:16,785
走吧！…走就对了

2502
02:21:16,890 --> 02:21:18,983
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

2503
02:21:16,990 --> 02:21:19,618
快点！安琪拉，快走

2504
02:21:20,727 --> 02:21:22,820
走吧！闪了！

2505
02:21:20,761 --> 02:21:22,854
Hey, come on! Scram!

2506
02:21:24,431 --> 02:21:25,455
走吧，亲爱的，走了

2507
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:28,058
Come on, honey. I don't know what's the matter with him, Johnny.

2508
02:21:25,532 --> 02:21:26,521
我不知道，强尼

2509
02:21:26,599 --> 02:21:28,965
我不知道他是怎么回事 对不起

2510
02:21:29,269 --> 02:21:30,497
没关系，弗雷多

2511
02:21:29,436 --> 02:21:31,267
Sorry.

2512
02:21:31,404 --> 02:21:33,998
走吧！亲爱的 我不知道，他大概累了

2513
02:21:31,405 --> 02:21:33,930
I don't know. He's tired.

2514
02:21:40,981 --> 02:21:43,950
What happened to Moe Greene?

2515
02:21:41,081 --> 02:21:42,446
莫格林呢？

2516
02:21:44,084 --> 02:21:48,453
He had some business. He said to give him a call when the party started.

2517
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:45,412
他说他有别的事

2518
02:21:45,552 --> 02:21:47,952
他说派对开始时，给他个电话

2519
02:21:48,589 --> 02:21:50,716
Well, give him a call.

2520
02:21:48,688 --> 02:21:49,985
那就打电话给他

2521
02:21:51,691 --> 02:21:53,022
强尼，你好吗？

2522
02:21:51,825 --> 02:21:55,124
- Johnny, how are you? - Nice to see you, Mike.

2523
02:21:53,193 --> 02:21:54,990
麦克，再看到你真高兴

2524
02:21:55,161 --> 02:21:56,185
我们全都以你为傲

2525
02:21:55,262 --> 02:21:57,230
- We're proud of you. - Thanks.

2526
02:21:56,463 --> 02:21:57,452
谢谢，麦克

2527
02:21:57,364 --> 02:22:00,891
Sit down, I want to talk to you. The Don is proud too.

2528
02:21:57,630 --> 02:21:58,824
坐，强尼，我要跟你谈谈

2529
02:21:59,666 --> 02:22:01,099
教父也以你为傲，强尼

2530
02:22:01,034 --> 02:22:04,003
Well, I owe it all to him.

2531
02:22:01,201 --> 02:22:03,328
我的一切都归功于他

2532
02:22:04,137 --> 02:22:09,268
He knows how grateful you are. That's why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

2533
02:22:04,270 --> 02:22:05,862
他知道你会感恩

2534
02:22:06,139 --> 02:22:08,733
所以他想请你帮个忙

2535
02:22:09,409 --> 02:22:10,603
麦克，我能做些什么？

2536
02:22:09,409 --> 02:22:11,343
Mike, what can I do?

2537
02:22:12,579 --> 02:22:18,643
We're thinking of giving up our interests in the olive oil business and settle here.

2538
02:22:12,712 --> 02:22:16,546
柯里昂家族想放弃 橄榄油的生意

2539
02:22:16,716 --> 02:22:17,740
而在这里安顿下来

2540
02:22:18,785 --> 02:22:24,781
Moe will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

2541
02:22:18,852 --> 02:22:22,219
莫格林会把他旅馆 及赌场的股份卖给我们

2542
02:22:22,322 --> 02:22:24,051
使得家族能拥有全部的生意

2543
02:22:24,124 --> 02:22:25,113
汤姆！

2544
02:22:24,925 --> 02:22:30,056
Are you sure? Moe loves the business. He never said nothing about selling.

2545
02:22:25,191 --> 02:22:26,681
麦克，这点你确定吗？

2546
02:22:27,193 --> 02:22:28,285
莫格林很爱这门生意

2547
02:22:28,428 --> 02:22:30,055
从未对我提过要卖掉它的事

2548
02:22:30,197 --> 02:22:33,098
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

2549
02:22:30,296 --> 02:22:32,264
我会提个他无法拒绝的条件

2550
02:22:34,234 --> 02:22:36,566
See, Johnny...

2551
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:35,324
知道吗？强尼…

2552
02:22:36,703 --> 02:22:40,901
We figure that entertainment would draw gamblers to the casino.

2553
02:22:36,770 --> 02:22:40,934
我们认为表演一定可以 吸引赌客到赌场来

2554
02:22:41,041 --> 02:22:44,636
We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year.

2555
02:22:41,107 --> 02:22:44,167
我们希望你签个合约 一年来此登台五次

2556
02:22:47,648 --> 02:22:52,449
Perhaps convince some of your friends in the movies to do the same.

2557
02:22:47,714 --> 02:22:48,908
也许…

2558
02:22:49,516 --> 02:22:52,485
顺便找些你电影圈中的朋友

2559
02:22:53,453 --> 02:22:55,546
We're counting on you.

2560
02:22:53,686 --> 02:22:54,914
我指望你了

2561
02:22:57,691 --> 02:23:01,559
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my godfather.

2562
02:22:57,724 --> 02:22:58,816
当然，麦克

2563
02:22:59,092 --> 02:23:01,287
为了教父我什么都肯做 你晓得的

2564
02:23:01,695 --> 02:23:02,992
Good.

2565
02:23:01,828 --> 02:23:02,817
很好

2566
02:23:04,464 --> 02:23:09,163
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows. Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

2567
02:23:04,531 --> 02:23:07,056
麦克，各位好，大家都在这

2568
02:23:07,167 --> 02:23:08,691
弗雷多，汤姆…

2569
02:23:09,303 --> 02:23:11,601
- Good to see you. - How are you, Moe?

2570
02:23:09,335 --> 02:23:11,360
-见到你真好，麦克 -你好吗？莫

2571
02:23:11,471 --> 02:23:12,597
你点的都到齐了吗？

2572
02:23:11,738 --> 02:23:16,766
Have everything? Specially prepared food, the best dancers, and good credit.

2573
02:23:12,705 --> 02:23:16,436
大厨会为你煮最好吃的菜 还有最棒的舞群

2574
02:23:16,743 --> 02:23:18,176
给房间里的每个人 都弄点筹码来

2575
02:23:16,910 --> 02:23:20,175
Draw chips for everybody, so they can play on the house.

2576
02:23:18,311 --> 02:23:19,573
好让他们到场子里去玩玩

2577
02:23:23,149 --> 02:23:25,117
我的信用好的 够买下你的股份吗？

2578
02:23:23,150 --> 02:23:26,278
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?

2579
02:23:27,253 --> 02:23:28,845
买我的股份？

2580
02:23:27,721 --> 02:23:29,416
Buy me out?

2581
02:23:29,523 --> 02:23:34,517
The casino, the hotel. The Corleone family wants to buy you out.

2582
02:23:29,622 --> 02:23:31,749
赌场，这家旅馆

2583
02:23:32,358 --> 02:23:34,451
柯里昂家族想买下 你全部的生意

2584
02:23:35,161 --> 02:23:37,595
柯里昂家族想买下 我全部的生意？

2585
02:23:35,295 --> 02:23:40,631
The Corleone family wants to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

2586
02:23:38,298 --> 02:23:40,596
不，我买下你们的 你不能买下我的

2587
02:23:40,767 --> 02:23:44,066
Your casino loses money. We can do better.

2588
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:42,299
你的赌场在赔钱

2589
02:23:42,635 --> 02:23:43,863
也许我们能经营的好一点

2590
02:23:44,204 --> 02:23:48,732
- You think I'm skimming off the top? - You're unlucky.

2591
02:23:44,304 --> 02:23:45,999
你认为我在走下坡了？麦克

2592
02:23:47,473 --> 02:23:48,565
你运气不好

2593
02:23:53,046 --> 02:23:55,446
你他妈的别让我笑了

2594
02:23:53,046 --> 02:23:55,412
You Guineas make me laugh.

2595
02:23:55,549 --> 02:24:00,350
I took Freddy in when you had a bad time, and now you try to push me out!

2596
02:23:55,615 --> 02:23:56,604
在你们有难时

2597
02:23:56,783 --> 02:23:58,307
我帮你们的忙 给弗雷多一份差事

2598
02:23:58,484 --> 02:23:59,815
现在你想把我弄出去

2599
02:23:59,986 --> 02:24:01,078
慢着

2600
02:24:01,387 --> 02:24:02,479
你让弗雷多来这

2601
02:24:01,455 --> 02:24:04,788
You did that because we bankrolled your casino

2602
02:24:02,622 --> 02:24:04,920
是因为柯里昂家族 支援你的赌场

2603
02:24:04,925 --> 02:24:10,192
and the Molinari family guaranteed his safety. Let's talk business.

2604
02:24:05,091 --> 02:24:06,718
因为海岸的莫伦纳家族

2605
02:24:06,893 --> 02:24:08,224
保证他的安全

2606
02:24:08,394 --> 02:24:10,294
现在我们在谈生意 别岔开话题

2607
02:24:10,330 --> 02:24:15,597
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

2608
02:24:10,463 --> 02:24:11,623
好，我们来谈生意，麦克

2609
02:24:11,831 --> 02:24:13,025
首先，你们都完蛋了

2610
02:24:13,199 --> 02:24:15,326
柯里昂家族已经衰退了

2611
02:24:15,501 --> 02:24:17,093
教父生病了，对吧？

2612
02:24:15,736 --> 02:24:20,139
The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by the others.

2613
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:20,000
你们被巴西尼及其他家族 赶出了纽约

2614
02:24:20,173 --> 02:24:21,333
你以为这里是什么？

2615
02:24:20,273 --> 02:24:24,073
Do you think you can come to my hotel and take over?

2616
02:24:21,507 --> 02:24:23,839
你以为能到我的 地盘上来接管？

2617
02:24:24,211 --> 02:24:29,205
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel!

2618
02:24:24,244 --> 02:24:25,768
我和巴西尼谈过了

2619
02:24:25,879 --> 02:24:27,039
我有办法和他打交道

2620
02:24:27,146 --> 02:24:28,670
也不至于失去旅馆

2621
02:24:29,349 --> 02:24:32,079
Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?

2622
02:24:29,415 --> 02:24:31,542
所以你当众支使我哥哥？

2623
02:24:32,986 --> 02:24:37,685
That was nothing, Mike. Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

2624
02:24:33,152 --> 02:24:35,017
不，麦克，那不算什么

2625
02:24:35,121 --> 02:24:37,715
莫也不是那个意思

2626
02:24:37,824 --> 02:24:40,190
当然他偶尔说话很大声但是…

2627
02:24:37,824 --> 02:24:42,022
He flies off the handle sometimes, but we're good friends.

2628
02:24:40,293 --> 02:24:42,386
莫和我是好朋友，对吧？莫

2629
02:24:42,162 --> 02:24:46,861
I have a business to run. I've got to kick asses sometimes.

2630
02:24:42,562 --> 02:24:43,859
我是在做事业！

2631
02:24:44,264 --> 02:24:46,664
当然要催紧点，事情才会顺利

2632
02:24:46,966 --> 02:24:48,433
我是偶尔和弗雷多意见不合

2633
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,936
We had an argument, so I had to straighten him out.

2634
02:24:48,534 --> 02:24:50,092
只不过是为了“训练”他一下

2635
02:24:51,037 --> 02:24:52,732
你“训练”我哥哥？

2636
02:24:51,071 --> 02:24:53,699
You straightened my brother out?

2637
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:58,334
He was banging cocktail waitresses! Players couldn't get a drink.

2638
02:24:53,907 --> 02:24:56,205
他跟酒廊的女侍鬼混

2639
02:24:56,309 --> 02:24:58,402
客人喝酒没人送

2640
02:24:58,478 --> 02:25:00,537
What's wrong with you?

2641
02:24:58,511 --> 02:24:59,773
你是怎么回事？

2642
02:25:05,218 --> 02:25:08,881
I leave for New York tomorrow. Think about a price.

2643
02:25:05,351 --> 02:25:06,943
我明天回纽约

2644
02:25:07,654 --> 02:25:08,916
你考虑一个价钱吧

2645
02:25:09,523 --> 02:25:10,820
Son-of-a-bitch!

2646
02:25:10,957 --> 02:25:16,224
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were out with cheerleaders.

2647
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:13,650
你知道我是谁吗？我是莫格林

2648
02:25:13,826 --> 02:25:16,351
我发迹时你还在玩泥巴

2649
02:25:16,363 --> 02:25:18,854
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

2650
02:25:16,529 --> 02:25:18,224
等一等，莫，我有个主意

2651
02:25:19,866 --> 02:25:23,358
Tom, you're the consigliere. Talk to the Don...

2652
02:25:19,999 --> 02:25:22,024
汤姆！汤姆，你是军师

2653
02:25:22,135 --> 02:25:23,602
你可以和教父谈，解释给他听

2654
02:25:23,503 --> 02:25:28,736
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and Mike is in charge of the family business.

2655
02:25:23,736 --> 02:25:26,569
慢着！教父已经半退休了

2656
02:25:26,706 --> 02:25:28,731
家族现在由麦克管事

2657
02:25:28,875 --> 02:25:32,140
If you have anything to say, say it to Michael.

2658
02:25:28,942 --> 02:25:31,570
你有话就向麦克说吧

2659
02:25:36,015 --> 02:25:38,381
麦克，你不能到拉斯维加斯来

2660
02:25:36,116 --> 02:25:41,315
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

2661
02:25:38,484 --> 02:25:41,009
和莫格林那种人那样说话

2662
02:25:42,923 --> 02:25:44,117
Fredo...

2663
02:25:42,956 --> 02:25:43,980
弗雷多

2664
02:25:45,258 --> 02:25:48,193
You're my older brother, and I love you.

2665
02:25:45,325 --> 02:25:47,691
你是我哥，我爱你

2666
02:25:49,529 --> 02:25:53,090
但不准你再联合外人 起来反对自己家族

2667
02:25:49,529 --> 02:25:53,659
But don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again.

2668
02:25:54,367 --> 02:25:55,231
绝对不准

2669
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:08,379
I have to see my father and his people, so have dinner without me.

2670
02:26:04,243 --> 02:26:05,733
我必须先去看我父亲 和他的手下

2671
02:26:05,912 --> 02:26:07,209
你们先吃饭吧

2672
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:08,469
麦克

2673
02:26:10,050 --> 02:26:15,249
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to the city, see a show and have dinner.

2674
02:26:10,149 --> 02:26:11,377
这个周末我们可以出外游玩

2675
02:26:11,551 --> 02:26:14,577
到城里看电影吃饭，我保证

2676
02:26:22,195 --> 02:26:25,187
Your sister wants to ask you something.

2677
02:26:22,462 --> 02:26:23,486
麦克

2678
02:26:23,596 --> 02:26:25,291
麦克，你姐姐有事想问你

2679
02:26:25,332 --> 02:26:27,459
- Let her ask. - She's afraid to.

2680
02:26:25,465 --> 02:26:27,330
-她可以问我！ -她怕你

2681
02:26:27,601 --> 02:26:30,570
They want you to be godfather to their boy.

2682
02:26:27,667 --> 02:26:30,602
康妮和卡洛 要你当他们孩子的教父

2683
02:26:30,703 --> 02:26:32,568
-到时再说吧！ -你会吗？

2684
02:26:30,704 --> 02:26:32,467
- We'll see. - Will you?

2685
02:26:32,606 --> 02:26:34,836
Let me think about it. Come on.

2686
02:26:32,672 --> 02:26:34,435
让我考虑一下 到时再说，来吧

2687
02:26:41,848 --> 02:26:45,978
巴西尼想要先对付你

2688
02:26:43,650 --> 02:26:46,551
Barzini will move against you first.

2689
02:26:46,686 --> 02:26:51,123
He'll set up a meeting with someone you absolutely trust.

2690
02:26:46,819 --> 02:26:50,118
他会找个你信任的人 来安排见面

2691
02:26:51,258 --> 02:26:53,453
Guaranteeing your safety.

2692
02:26:51,324 --> 02:26:53,258
并保证你的安全

2693
02:26:54,461 --> 02:26:57,953
And at that meeting you'll be assassinated.

2694
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:57,427
但你一出席会议，他就杀了你

2695
02:27:02,402 --> 02:27:05,803
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

2696
02:27:02,635 --> 02:27:05,126
我现在比以前爱喝酒了

2697
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:10,606
- Anyway, I'm drinking more. - It's good for you, Pop.

2698
02:27:06,873 --> 02:27:08,807
而且越爱喝就喝的越多

2699
02:27:09,208 --> 02:27:10,675
对你有好处的，爸爸

2700
02:27:15,448 --> 02:27:16,938
I don't know.

2701
02:27:15,515 --> 02:27:16,846
我不知道

2702
02:27:18,885 --> 02:27:21,786
Are you happy with your wife and children?

2703
02:27:18,985 --> 02:27:21,283
你太太和小孩过的还快乐吧？

2704
02:27:22,789 --> 02:27:25,986
- Very happy. - That's good.

2705
02:27:22,889 --> 02:27:23,913
非常快乐

2706
02:27:24,824 --> 02:27:26,052
很好

2707
02:27:27,494 --> 02:27:32,329
I hope you don't mind the way I keep going over this Barzini business.

2708
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:31,997
希望你不介意 我一直在谈巴西尼

2709
02:27:32,465 --> 02:27:35,866
- No, not at all. - It's an old habit.

2710
02:27:32,498 --> 02:27:33,931
不，一点也不

2711
02:27:34,534 --> 02:27:35,865
这是我的老习惯

2712
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:39,839
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

2713
02:27:36,969 --> 02:27:39,699
我花了一辈子 就学会了“小心”

2714
02:27:41,474 --> 02:27:44,932
Women and children can be careless, but not men.

2715
02:27:41,541 --> 02:27:44,374
女人和小孩能够粗心大意 但男人不行

2716
02:27:48,181 --> 02:27:50,547
- How's your boy? - He's good.

2717
02:27:48,247 --> 02:27:50,442
-你儿子还好吗？ -很好

2718
02:27:50,684 --> 02:27:53,812
He looks more like you every day.

2719
02:27:50,817 --> 02:27:53,012
你知道他越来越像你了

2720
02:27:56,189 --> 02:28:00,489
He's smarter than I am. He's three and can read the funny papers.

2721
02:27:56,255 --> 02:27:57,745
他比我聪明

2722
02:27:58,724 --> 02:28:00,715
才三岁就懂得看漫画了

2723
02:28:02,696 --> 02:28:04,891
Read the funny papers.

2724
02:28:02,762 --> 02:28:04,559
看漫画

2725
02:28:11,938 --> 02:28:17,638
I want you to arrange for a telephone man to check all in- and out-going calls.

2726
02:28:12,038 --> 02:28:14,336
我要你安排一个电话公司的人

2727
02:28:14,507 --> 02:28:17,806
查每一个进出这里的电话

2728
02:28:17,777 --> 02:28:23,545
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop. - That's right. I forgot.

2729
02:28:17,977 --> 02:28:20,104
-我已经做了，爸 -任何一个人都有可能

2730
02:28:20,279 --> 02:28:23,407
-爸！我已经处理那件事了 -没错，我忘了

2731
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:29,554
What's the matter?

2732
02:28:27,153 --> 02:28:28,313
怎么回事？

2733
02:28:29,689 --> 02:28:31,748
What's bothering you?

2734
02:28:29,789 --> 02:28:31,222
是什么困扰着你？

2735
02:28:35,228 --> 02:28:39,790
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it, so I'll handle it.

2736
02:28:35,294 --> 02:28:40,197
我应付得了，我说能，我就能

2737
02:28:53,179 --> 02:28:57,616
I knew that Santino would have to go through all this.

2738
02:28:53,279 --> 02:28:56,840
我知道山提诺 势必会染指家族事业

2739
02:28:57,751 --> 02:28:59,719
And Fredo...

2740
02:28:57,783 --> 02:28:59,307
还有弗雷多

2741
02:29:02,022 --> 02:29:04,490
Fredo was, well...

2742
02:29:02,188 --> 02:29:04,019
弗雷多他…

2743
02:29:05,992 --> 02:29:09,257
But I never wanted this for you.

2744
02:29:06,092 --> 02:29:07,286
但我从来没…

2745
02:29:07,426 --> 02:29:09,291
我从来没想到要你参与

2746
02:29:11,097 --> 02:29:13,224
我干了一辈子，没什么遗憾的

2747
02:29:11,097 --> 02:29:16,125
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise for taking care of my family.

2748
02:29:13,399 --> 02:29:15,663
我照顾了我的家人

2749
02:29:16,269 --> 02:29:20,137
And I refused to be a fool,

2750
02:29:16,335 --> 02:29:18,997
但是我绝不当傻瓜

2751
02:29:20,273 --> 02:29:24,733
dancing on a string held by all those big shots.

2752
02:29:20,339 --> 02:29:24,776
让那些大人物在幕后操纵我

2753
02:29:26,379 --> 02:29:29,542
我不必道歉，那是我的命运 但是我想过…

2754
02:29:26,379 --> 02:29:29,746
I don't apologise. That's my life, but I thought that...

2755
02:29:31,518 --> 02:29:36,717
...that when it was your time, you would be the one to hold the strings.

2756
02:29:31,584 --> 02:29:36,988
有一天你能当那些操纵的人

2757
02:29:38,458 --> 02:29:44,021
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone. Something.

2758
02:29:38,591 --> 02:29:41,321
柯里昂参议员

2759
02:29:42,094 --> 02:29:43,686
柯里昂州长之类的

2760
02:29:43,863 --> 02:29:46,161
再建立一个王国

2761
02:29:44,164 --> 02:29:47,156
Another pezzo da novanta.

2762
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:48,961
Well...

2763
02:29:47,433 --> 02:29:49,128
这个…

2764
02:29:52,138 --> 02:29:56,074
Just wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time.

2765
02:29:52,205 --> 02:29:55,504
时间不多了，麦克 时间不多了

2766
02:29:56,209 --> 02:30:00,168
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

2767
02:29:56,275 --> 02:29:57,640
我们会做到的，爸

2768
02:29:58,978 --> 02:30:00,343
我们会做到的

2769
02:30:04,551 --> 02:30:08,954
Now listen, whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting,

2770
02:30:04,650 --> 02:30:05,878
你听好…

2771
02:30:05,985 --> 02:30:08,317
谁请你去和巴西尼开会

2772
02:30:09,088 --> 02:30:10,783
他就是叛徒

2773
02:30:09,089 --> 02:30:12,581
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

2774
02:30:10,923 --> 02:30:12,322
千万别忘了

2775
02:30:29,109 --> 02:30:31,873
Can I hold it, please?

2776
02:30:29,141 --> 02:30:32,872
能让我拿吗？

2777
02:30:40,586 --> 02:30:42,213
我能自己浇水

2778
02:30:46,292 --> 02:30:50,228
- Can I water these? - Yes, go ahead.

2779
02:30:46,459 --> 02:30:47,892
我可以浇水吗？

2780
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,991
可以，浇吧！

2781
02:30:50,363 --> 02:30:53,423
Over here, over here.

2782
02:30:50,463 --> 02:30:53,899
这里，来这里

2783
02:30:55,001 --> 02:30:58,027
Be careful. You're spilling it.

2784
02:30:55,034 --> 02:30:57,798
小心点，别溅到了，小心

2785
02:31:03,810 --> 02:31:05,243
Antony!

2786
02:31:03,843 --> 02:31:06,903
安东尼，过来，来吧…

2787
02:31:05,378 --> 02:31:07,073
Come here, come here.

2788
02:31:09,015 --> 02:31:10,141
来这里

2789
02:31:11,684 --> 02:31:14,346
That's it. We'll put it right there.

2790
02:31:11,751 --> 02:31:14,345
对了，放在这

2791
02:31:20,493 --> 02:31:23,394
I'll show you something. Come here.

2792
02:31:20,626 --> 02:31:22,423
来，有东西给你看

2793
02:31:22,928 --> 02:31:24,122
来这

2794
02:31:24,998 --> 02:31:26,863
Stand there.

2795
02:31:25,064 --> 02:31:26,554
你站好

2796
02:31:30,603 --> 02:31:32,867
Give me an orange!

2797
02:31:30,703 --> 02:31:32,261
把柳丁给我

2798
02:31:40,146 --> 02:31:41,909
别怕

2799
02:31:50,757 --> 02:31:52,748
That's a new trick.

2800
02:31:50,856 --> 02:31:52,551
这是新把戏

2801
02:31:53,793 --> 02:31:56,455
You run in there. Run in there.

2802
02:31:53,826 --> 02:31:55,987
你去里面，去里面

2803
02:32:09,542 --> 02:32:11,476
Where are you?

2804
02:32:09,608 --> 02:32:10,734
你在哪？

2805
02:32:13,679 --> 02:32:15,078
倒下去

2806
02:35:09,022 --> 02:35:11,422
Mike, can I have a minute?

2807
02:35:09,088 --> 02:35:10,783
麦克，能借一步说话吗？

2808
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,627
巴西尼想要安排一次会议

2809
02:35:21,501 --> 02:35:23,833
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

2810
02:35:23,836 --> 02:35:24,894
他说任何的问题

2811
02:35:23,970 --> 02:35:26,996
He says we can straighten out any of our problems.

2812
02:35:25,070 --> 02:35:26,765
都可以谈出一个解决之道

2813
02:35:28,107 --> 02:35:30,541
- You talked to him? - Yeah.

2814
02:35:28,140 --> 02:35:29,767
-你和他谈过了？ -是的

2815
02:35:31,544 --> 02:35:33,136
我能安排安全事宜

2816
02:35:31,544 --> 02:35:35,742
I can arrange security. On my territory.

2817
02:35:34,146 --> 02:35:39,345
在我的地盘上，好吗？

2818
02:35:38,418 --> 02:35:41,444
- All right? - All right.

2819
02:35:40,519 --> 02:35:42,487
-好的 -好！

2820
02:35:58,538 --> 02:36:01,302
Do you know how they're going to come at you?

2821
02:35:58,604 --> 02:36:01,129
你知道他们预备 怎么对付你吗？

2822
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:08,276
They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

2823
02:36:04,109 --> 02:36:05,872
他们安排在布鲁克林开会

2824
02:36:06,512 --> 02:36:08,070
泰西欧的地盘上

2825
02:36:09,782 --> 02:36:11,716
Where I'll be safe.

2826
02:36:09,815 --> 02:36:11,305
说在那我会安全的

2827
02:36:23,863 --> 02:36:27,424
I always thought it would be Clemenza, not Tessio.

2828
02:36:23,896 --> 02:36:26,524
我一直以为是克里曼沙 没想到是泰西欧

2829
02:36:27,567 --> 02:36:31,936
It's the smart move. Tessio was always smarter.

2830
02:36:27,633 --> 02:36:31,660
这一招漂亮，泰西欧一向聪明

2831
02:36:33,573 --> 02:36:35,939
But I'm going to wait.

2832
02:36:33,706 --> 02:36:35,435
但我会静观其变

2833
02:36:36,075 --> 02:36:38,236
After the baptism.

2834
02:36:36,275 --> 02:36:37,902
等洗礼过了再说

2835
02:36:40,379 --> 02:36:43,075
I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby.

2836
02:36:40,446 --> 02:36:43,142
我决定当康妮小孩的教父了

2837
02:36:44,283 --> 02:36:47,309
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

2838
02:36:44,416 --> 02:36:46,441
然后我再去见巴西尼

2839
02:36:47,453 --> 02:36:52,288
and Tattaglia. All the heads of the five families.

2840
02:36:47,486 --> 02:36:48,851
还有塔塔基利亚

2841
02:36:49,855 --> 02:36:52,153
所有五大家族的族长

2842
02:37:18,984 --> 02:37:22,112
（意大利文祷词）

2843
02:37:29,628 --> 02:37:30,754
阿门

2844
02:37:32,097 --> 02:37:35,999
（意大利文祷词）

2845
02:39:13,632 --> 02:39:14,894
麦克，你相信上帝吗？

2846
02:39:13,666 --> 02:39:18,467
Michael, do you believe in God, the Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

2847
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:18,299
全能的天父，万物的创造者

2848
02:39:18,604 --> 02:39:19,696
I do.

2849
02:39:18,837 --> 02:39:19,861
我相信

2850
02:39:19,839 --> 02:39:23,434
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord?

2851
02:39:20,072 --> 02:39:23,303
你相信耶稣基督 他的独子，我们的主吗？

2852
02:39:23,475 --> 02:39:24,567
我相信

2853
02:39:23,576 --> 02:39:24,668
I do.

2854
02:39:24,676 --> 02:39:28,305
你相信圣灵，神圣的教堂吗？

2855
02:39:24,810 --> 02:39:28,871
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?

2856
02:39:28,847 --> 02:39:29,939
我相信

2857
02:39:29,015 --> 02:39:30,243
I do.

2858
02:39:30,282 --> 02:39:32,910
（意大利文祷词）

2859

麦克柯里昂

2860
02:40:35,748 --> 02:40:40,117
Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?

2861
02:40:37,916 --> 02:40:40,111
你弃绝撒旦吗？

2862
02:40:46,192 --> 02:40:47,682
I do renounce him.

2863
02:40:46,391 --> 02:40:47,653
我弃绝

2864
02:40:57,269 --> 02:40:58,793
And all his works?

2865
02:40:57,502 --> 02:40:59,197
包括他所有的作为吗？

2866
02:41:12,585 --> 02:41:13,677
I do renounce them.

2867
02:41:12,618 --> 02:41:13,778
我弃绝

2868
02:41:15,421 --> 02:41:16,615
Oh, God!

2869
02:41:19,392 --> 02:41:23,351
- And all his pomps? - I do renounce them.

2870
02:41:19,558 --> 02:41:21,025
包括他所有的虚伪？

2871
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:23,057
我弃绝

2872
02:41:38,744 --> 02:41:43,113
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

2873
02:41:39,011 --> 02:41:40,444
麦克柯里昂

2874
02:41:41,179 --> 02:41:42,976
你愿意当他的教父吗？

2875
02:41:43,215 --> 02:41:44,341
我愿意

2876
02:41:43,249 --> 02:41:44,477
I will.

2877
02:41:44,750 --> 02:41:46,445
（意大利文祷词）

2878
02:41:51,757 --> 02:41:57,696
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

麦克柯里昂

2880
02:41:53,592 --> 02:41:57,551
愿主与你同在，阿门

2881
02:42:11,109 --> 02:42:12,201
凯

2882
02:42:11,310 --> 02:42:13,210
Kay!

2883
02:42:13,345 --> 02:42:15,438
Kiss your godfather.

2884
02:42:13,478 --> 02:42:15,070
这是你的教父！

2885
02:42:39,672 --> 02:42:45,440
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come up. Everybody has to leave without us.

2886
02:42:39,738 --> 02:42:40,898
卡洛

2887
02:42:41,773 --> 02:42:43,001
我现在不能去拉斯维加斯

2888
02:42:43,208 --> 02:42:45,574
临时有要事，让他们先走吧！

2889
02:42:45,578 --> 02:42:49,036
- Mike, it's our first vacation! - Connie, please.

2890
02:42:45,811 --> 02:42:48,439
-麦克，这是我们第一次度假 -康妮，别吵

2891
02:42:48,547 --> 02:42:51,414
-你要我怎么做 -回家去等我电话，有要事

2892
02:42:49,181 --> 02:42:52,378
Go back to the house, wait for my call. It's important.

2893
02:42:51,583 --> 02:42:52,675
好的

2894
02:42:53,618 --> 02:42:55,245
我只需一两天

2895
02:42:53,686 --> 02:42:56,052
I'll only be a couple of days.

2896
02:42:58,590 --> 02:43:00,182
旅途愉快，妈

2897
02:43:12,037 --> 02:43:14,232
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

2898
02:43:12,137 --> 02:43:13,570
我们要去布鲁克林了

2899
02:43:16,308 --> 02:43:20,506
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal. - I'm sure he will.

2900
02:43:16,408 --> 02:43:18,672
我希望麦克今晚能谈个好交易

2901
02:43:18,877 --> 02:43:19,935
他一定会的

2902
02:43:27,853 --> 02:43:33,291
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a separate car, so you two go on ahead.

2903
02:43:28,086 --> 02:43:29,246
沙尔、汤姆

2904
02:43:29,388 --> 02:43:31,083
老板说他自己坐车来

2905
02:43:31,256 --> 02:43:32,848
叫你们先走

2906
02:43:33,358 --> 02:43:34,416
他不能那么做

2907
02:43:33,425 --> 02:43:36,883
- That screws up my arrangements. - That's what he said.

2908
02:43:34,493 --> 02:43:37,018
-弄乱了我所有的安排 -他是这么说的

2909
02:43:37,029 --> 02:43:39,190
I can't go either, Sal.

2910
02:43:37,195 --> 02:43:38,355
我也不能去，沙尔

2911
02:43:51,143 --> 02:43:55,842
Tell Mike it was only business. I always liked him.

2912
02:43:51,209 --> 02:43:53,200
告诉麦克这纯粹是生意

2913
02:43:54,079 --> 02:43:55,671
我一直都喜欢他

2914
02:43:56,648 --> 02:43:57,740
他会了解的，沙尔

2915
02:43:56,782 --> 02:43:59,751
- He understands that. - Excuse me, Sal.

2916
02:43:57,849 --> 02:43:59,180
抱歉了，沙尔

2917
02:44:05,624 --> 02:44:08,092
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

2918
02:44:05,791 --> 02:44:07,520
汤姆，能替我求个情吗？

2919
02:44:09,195 --> 02:44:12,494
- For old times' sake? - Can't do it, Sally.

2920
02:44:09,294 --> 02:44:12,058
-看在老交情的份上 -我做不到，沙尔

2921
02:44:57,910 --> 02:45:00,276
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

2922
02:44:57,976 --> 02:45:00,035
你得为山尼的事偿命，卡洛

2923
02:45:05,417 --> 02:45:09,319
- Mike, you got it all wrong. - You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

2924
02:45:05,717 --> 02:45:09,118
-你误会了，麦克 -你为巴西尼的人设计害山尼

2925
02:45:10,522 --> 02:45:14,253
That little farce you played with my sister.

2926
02:45:10,622 --> 02:45:13,420
你和我姐姐演的那场闹剧

2927
02:45:14,393 --> 02:45:19,626
- You think that could fool a Corleone? - I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

2928
02:45:14,526 --> 02:45:16,323
以为骗得过柯里昂家的人吗？

2929
02:45:16,495 --> 02:45:17,655
麦克，我是清白的

2930
02:45:17,863 --> 02:45:19,194
我以我的孩子来发誓

2931
02:45:19,631 --> 02:45:21,861
-求你，麦克，别这样对我 -坐下

2932
02:45:19,765 --> 02:45:23,098
- Please, don't do this. - Sit down.

2933
02:45:25,137 --> 02:45:27,605
Don't do this to me, please.

2934
02:45:25,337 --> 02:45:27,100
麦克，别这样对我，求你

2935
02:45:36,649 --> 02:45:38,708
Barzini is dead.

2936
02:45:36,781 --> 02:45:38,078
巴西尼死了！

2937
02:45:40,386 --> 02:45:42,718
So is Philip Tattaglia.

2938
02:45:40,418 --> 02:45:42,318
菲立浦塔塔基利亚也死了

2939
02:45:44,023 --> 02:45:45,490
Moe Greene.

2940
02:45:44,156 --> 02:45:50,891
还有莫格林、史特基 克里安诺

2941
02:45:46,458 --> 02:45:50,895
Strachi. Cuneo.

2942
02:45:52,063 --> 02:45:53,690
今天我一次清理整个家族的事

2943
02:45:52,131 --> 02:45:56,568
Today I settle all family business, so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

2944
02:45:53,865 --> 02:45:56,390
所以别跟我说你是无辜的 卡洛

2945
02:45:57,569 --> 02:45:59,730
Admit what you did.

2946
02:45:57,669 --> 02:45:59,261
承认你所做过的

2947
02:46:03,175 --> 02:46:05,200
Get him a drink.

2948
02:46:03,341 --> 02:46:04,603
给他一杯酒

2949
02:46:11,317 --> 02:46:12,477
Come on.

2950
02:46:11,483 --> 02:46:12,609
说吧！

2951
02:46:13,786 --> 02:46:18,689
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?

2952
02:46:13,885 --> 02:46:15,546
别怕，卡洛

2953
02:46:16,354 --> 02:46:19,289
你以为我忍心 让我姐姐当寡妇？

2954
02:46:20,292 --> 02:46:23,227
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

2955
02:46:20,392 --> 02:46:22,622
我又是你儿子的教父，卡洛

2956
02:46:29,935 --> 02:46:32,301
Go ahead, drink, drink.

2957
02:46:30,068 --> 02:46:32,263
喝吧！…

2958
02:46:36,875 --> 02:46:40,709
No, you're out of the family business. That's your punishment.

2959
02:46:36,975 --> 02:46:40,342
卡洛，从此你退出家族的生意 这是给你的惩罚

2960
02:46:41,747 --> 02:46:45,649
You're finished. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

2961
02:46:41,813 --> 02:46:45,249
你玩完了 我送你上飞机去拉斯维加斯

2962
02:46:45,784 --> 02:46:47,411
Tom.

2963
02:46:45,850 --> 02:46:46,976
汤姆

2964
02:46:51,490 --> 02:46:55,119
I want you to stay there. Understand?

2965
02:46:51,656 --> 02:46:54,147
我要你留在那边，明白吗？

2966
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,195
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

2967
02:46:55,293 --> 02:46:57,727
只是别告诉我你是无辜的

2968
02:46:59,164 --> 02:47:03,828
Because it insults my intelligence. Makes me very angry.

2969
02:46:59,264 --> 02:47:01,732
因为那等于把我当傻瓜

2970
02:47:02,334 --> 02:47:04,029
会让我非常生气

2971
02:47:07,639 --> 02:47:09,698
Who approached you?

2972
02:47:07,672 --> 02:47:09,765
现在，是谁和你接头的？

2973
02:47:10,909 --> 02:47:13,400
Tattaglia or Barzini?

2974
02:47:10,976 --> 02:47:13,206
塔塔基利亚还是巴西尼？

2975
02:47:21,053 --> 02:47:23,817
It was Barzini.

2976
02:47:21,152 --> 02:47:22,449
是巴西尼

2977
02:47:26,925 --> 02:47:28,517
Good.

2978
02:47:27,092 --> 02:47:28,116
好

2979
02:47:34,666 --> 02:47:38,659
There's a car waiting outside to take you to the airport.

2980
02:47:34,766 --> 02:47:37,530
外面有辆车等着送你去机场

2981
02:47:38,804 --> 02:47:42,001
I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.

2982
02:47:38,837 --> 02:47:40,998
我通知你太太说你坐那班飞机

2983
02:47:46,712 --> 02:47:49,510
- Mike... - Get out of my sight.

2984
02:47:46,878 --> 02:47:49,278
-麦克，我… -快走，别让我看到你

2985
02:48:15,374 --> 02:48:17,035
Hello, Carlo.

2986
02:48:15,473 --> 02:48:16,633
卡洛

2987
02:49:14,866 --> 02:49:16,663
你想告诉我什么？

2988
02:49:16,602 --> 02:49:19,969
- I'm trying to tell you... - Mama, please!

2989
02:49:16,968 --> 02:49:20,131
-我想告诉你… -妈妈，拜托…

2990
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:30,373
Michael!

2991
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:30,405
麦克！…

2992
02:49:30,516 --> 02:49:33,508
- What is it? - Where is he?

2993
02:49:30,648 --> 02:49:32,616
-怎么了？ -他在哪儿？麦克

2994
02:49:35,020 --> 02:49:40,014
Michael, you lousy bastard! You killed my husband.

2995
02:49:35,053 --> 02:49:39,490
麦克，你这混蛋 你杀了我丈夫

2996
02:49:40,091 --> 02:49:42,685
你看爸一死，就没人能管你了

2997
02:49:40,158 --> 02:49:44,219
You waited until Papa died, so nobody could stop you.

2998
02:49:42,794 --> 02:49:44,056
所以你就把他杀了

2999
02:49:44,295 --> 02:49:45,819
你一直把山尼的死怪在他身上

3000
02:49:44,363 --> 02:49:47,332
You blamed him for Sonny. Everybody did.

3001
02:49:45,997 --> 02:49:47,259
你一直如此，大家都如此

3002
02:49:47,432 --> 02:49:49,195
但你有没有想过我？

3003
02:49:47,466 --> 02:49:53,268
But you never thought about me! Now what are we going to do?

3004
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:51,165
从来不在乎我

3005
02:49:51,336 --> 02:49:53,201
我以后要怎么办？

3006
02:49:53,405 --> 02:49:55,168
Connie.

3007
02:49:53,438 --> 02:49:55,201
康妮…

3008
02:49:57,342 --> 02:50:02,803
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

3009
02:49:57,375 --> 02:49:59,866
你以为他为何要卡洛在他身边

3010
02:50:00,078 --> 02:50:02,342
他早就算计好要杀他

3011
02:50:02,948 --> 02:50:08,250
And you stood godfather to our baby. You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

3012
02:50:03,014 --> 02:50:05,847
你还是我孩子的教父

3013
02:50:06,017 --> 02:50:08,144
你这个冷酷的混蛋

3014
02:50:08,387 --> 02:50:12,380
Want to know how many men he had killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

3015
02:50:08,453 --> 02:50:10,819
你知道除了卡洛 他还杀过多少人吗？

3016
02:50:10,989 --> 02:50:12,422
看看报纸吧！…

3017
02:50:12,524 --> 02:50:15,755
是你丈夫…

3018
02:50:12,524 --> 02:50:16,187
That's your husband, that's your husband!

3019
02:50:25,103 --> 02:50:28,664
No! No, no...

3020
02:50:25,136 --> 02:50:28,799
不要！…

3021
02:50:29,274 --> 02:50:32,675
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

3022
02:50:29,374 --> 02:50:30,568
带她上楼

3023
02:50:31,576 --> 02:50:32,600
找医生来

3024
02:50:53,732 --> 02:50:55,461
She's hysterical.

3025
02:50:53,832 --> 02:50:55,094
她神经错乱了

3026
02:51:00,205 --> 02:51:01,900
Hysterical.

3027
02:51:00,271 --> 02:51:01,431
歇斯底里

3028
02:51:03,709 --> 02:51:04,971
Michael, is it true?

3029
02:51:03,808 --> 02:51:04,832
麦克，是真的吗？

3030
02:51:07,512 --> 02:51:11,107
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay. - Is it true?

3031
02:51:07,645 --> 02:51:10,705
-我跟你说过别管公事，凯 -是真的吗？

3032
02:51:11,249 --> 02:51:14,480
Don't ask me about my business. Enough!

3033
02:51:11,316 --> 02:51:12,908
别过问我的公事

3034
02:51:13,017 --> 02:51:14,575
-不！ -够了

3035
02:51:34,206 --> 02:51:35,696
All right.

3036
02:51:34,239 --> 02:51:35,501
好吧！

3037
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:40,401
This one time.

3038
02:51:38,510 --> 02:51:39,841
只此一次

3039
02:51:44,182 --> 02:51:46,776
This one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

3040
02:51:44,249 --> 02:51:46,877
这次我让你问吧！

3041
02:51:53,692 --> 02:51:54,818
Is it true?

3042
02:51:53,758 --> 02:51:54,884
是真的吗？

3043
02:51:59,231 --> 02:52:00,789
Is it?

3044
02:52:02,367 --> 02:52:03,800
No.

3045
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:03,524
不是

3046
02:52:17,416 --> 02:52:21,045
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

3047
02:52:17,615 --> 02:52:19,640
我想我们两个都需要喝一杯

3048
02:52:20,118 --> 02:52:21,142
我去倒

3049
02:52:51,817 --> 02:52:53,682
Don Corleone.

3050
02:52:51,950 --> 02:52:53,542
柯里昂阁下
