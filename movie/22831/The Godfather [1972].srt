1
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,174
I believe in America.

2
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,333
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,453
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,370
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,458
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,892
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,455
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,051
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,654
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,535
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,177
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,656
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,610
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,416
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,570
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,259
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,814
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,456
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,618
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,696
Sorry.

21
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,814
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,936
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,816
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,458
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,251
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,772
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

27
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,657
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

28
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,618
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,099
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,049
What is that?

31
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,614
I want them dead.

32
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,778
That I cannot do.

33
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,256
I'll give you anything you ask.

34
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,853
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

35
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,019
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,489
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

37
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,410
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,135
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,412
I didn't want to get into trouble.

40
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,656
I understand.

41
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,098
You found Paradise in America.

42
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,931
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

43
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,973
You didn't need a friend like me.

44
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,656
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,818
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

46
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,613
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,769
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

48
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,413
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,009
I ask you for justice.

50
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,893
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

51
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,779
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,013
How much shall I pay you?

53
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,294
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,255
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

55
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,849
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,009
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

57
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,977
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,858
And then they would fear you.

59
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,529
Be my friend?

60
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,693
Godfather?

61
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,292
Good.

62
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,019
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

63
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,773
But until that day...

64
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,858
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,733
- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego.

66
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,169
Give this to Clemenza.

67
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,256
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

68
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,339
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

69
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,697
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

70
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,733
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

71
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,693
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

72
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,896
Don Barzini.

73
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,457
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

74
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,049
Paulie! More wine.

75
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,776
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

76
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,736
Take a walk and do your job.

77
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,177
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

78
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,133
You watch yourself, all right?

79
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,139
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

80
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,091
In that little silk purse.

81
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,736
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

82
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,214
Hey, Paulie!

83
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,174
Stupid jerk!

84
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,656
What's the matter?

85
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,615
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

86
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,371
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

87
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,653
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

88
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,413
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

89
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,938
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

90
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,336
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

91
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,413
Come here, come here, come here!

92
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,976
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

93
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,933
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

94
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,210
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

95
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,490
Now that the war is over,

96
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,659
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

97
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,854
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

98
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,939
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

99
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,210
You understand everything.

100
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,574
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

101
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,208
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

102
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,139
The bride, the groom and the angel...

103
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,058
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisá.

104
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,380
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

105
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,016
Hey, Michael!

106
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,332
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

107
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,655
Is this necessary?

108
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,695
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

109
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,698
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

110
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,099
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

111
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,853
Michael...

112
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,291
That man over there
is talking to himself.

113
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,219
See that scary guy over there?

114
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,253
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

115
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,170
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

116
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,698
Michael, he's coming over here!

117
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,492
You look terrific!

118
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,897
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

119
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,609
Your father's been asking for you.

120
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,698
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,813
Why does your brother
have a different name?

122
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,410
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

123
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,693
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

124
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,893
He's been with us ever since.

125
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,574
He's a good lawyer.

126
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,137
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

127
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,013
- What's that?
- That's a...

128
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,498
...Iike a counsellor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

129
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,850
You like your lasagne?

130
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,096
Don Corleone.

131
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,575
I'm honoured and grateful

132
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,739
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

133
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,331
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

134
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,660
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

135
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,938
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

136
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,134
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

137
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,539
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

138
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,692
Thank you.

139
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,096
Signora Corleone!

140
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,972
No!

141
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,816
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

142
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,218
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

143
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,413
What is that outside?

144
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,058
Johnny! Johnny!

145
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,176
I love you!

146
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,050
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

147
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,412
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

148
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,136
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

149
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,294
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

150
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,334
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

151
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,249
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

152
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,416
How?

153
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,331
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

154
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,410
Please, Michael. Tell me.

155
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,690
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

156
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,368
with a big bandleader.

157
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,529
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

158
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,208
Johnny is my father's godson.

159
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,492
My father went to see this bandleader.

160
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,295
He offered him 10,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

161
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,889
but the bandleader said no.

162
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,413
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

163
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,091
Within an hour,

164
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,932
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

165
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,139
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

166
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,176
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

167
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,448
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

168
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,131
That's a true story.

169
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,972
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

170
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,336
Beautiful!

171
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,936
I'll take care of it.

172
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,699
Tom...

173
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,899
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

174
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,336
How are you, Fredo?

175
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,896
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

176
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,289
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

177
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,177
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

178
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,338
Yeah. This is your friend?

179
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,134
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

180
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,010
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

181
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,374
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

182
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,572
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

183
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,052
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

184
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,536
Sonny?

185
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,734
Sonny?

186
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,691
Sonny?

187
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,573
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

188
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,179
The old man wants you.

189
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,411
One minute.

190
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,770
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

191
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,211
The main character
is a guy just like me.

192
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,139
I wouldn't even have to act.

193
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,935
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

194
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,013
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

195
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,419
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
finocchio, that cries like a woman?

196
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,613
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

197
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,492
Ridiculous.

198
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,817
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

199
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,453
Good.

200
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,609
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

201
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,656
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

202
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,854
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

203
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,018
It's too late, they start shooting
in a week.

204
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,371
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

205
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,218
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

206
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,858
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

207
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,729
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

208
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,330
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

209
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,614
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

210
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,254
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

211
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,851
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

212
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,858
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

213
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,498
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

214
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,971
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

215
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,458
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

216
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,217
Wait a minute.

217
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,888
No, Michael. Not me.

218
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,254
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

219
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,815
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

220
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,659
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

221
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,170
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr Woltz,

222
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,894
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

223
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,250
Woltz is listening.

224
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,419
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

225
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,495
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr Woltz?

226
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,976
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

227
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,934
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

228
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,133
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

229
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,777
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

230
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,178
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

231
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,975
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

232
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,378
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

233
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,538
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

234
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,053
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

235
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,897
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

236
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,210
Check him out.

237
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,580
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

238
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,058
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

239
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,820
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

240
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,933
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

241
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,938
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

242
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,177
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

243
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,053
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

244
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,698
There you are.
600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

245
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,449
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

246
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,651
Khartoum.

247
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,532
Khartoum.

248
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,010
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

249
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,619
Thanks, Tony.

250
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,857
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,370
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

252
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,698
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

253
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,293
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

254
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,175
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

255
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,329
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

256
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,975
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

257
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,458
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

258
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,330
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

259
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,489
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

260
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,091
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

261
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,734
Let me be even more frank.

262
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,616
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

263
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,210
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

264
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,369
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

265
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:13,450
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

266
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,128
And she runs off.

267
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,616
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

268
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,460
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

269
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,810
You get the hell out of here!

270
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,252
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

271
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,331
Yeah, I heard that story.

272
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,649
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

273
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,328
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

274
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,419
Mr Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

275
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,974
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

276
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,978
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

277
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,250
Now...

278
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,260
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

279
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,859
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

280
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,018
His business is narcotics.

281
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,212
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

282
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,174
In Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

283
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,816
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

284
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,535
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

285
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,690
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

286
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,178
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

287
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,848
He's known as a top narcotics man.

288
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:31,259
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

289
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,173
Tom?

290
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,134
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

291
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,731
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

292
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,172
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

293
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,336
Then they come after us.

294
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,331
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

295
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:01,012
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

296
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,051
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

297
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,855
Don Corleone.

298
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,371
I need a man who has powerful friends.

299
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,014
I need a million dollars in cash.

300
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:27,931
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

301
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,934
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

302
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,099
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

303
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,894
And then it would go up.

304
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,536
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

305
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,529
My compliments.

306
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,133
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

307
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,891
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

308
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,251
political influence and legal protection?

309
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,020
That's right.

310
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,849
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

311
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,009
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

312
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,893
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

313
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,208
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

314
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,615
to be treated with respect.

315
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,490
But, I must say no to you.

316
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,894
And I'll give you my reason.

317
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,979
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

318
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,617
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

319
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,053
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

320
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,651
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

321
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,888
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

322
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,979
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

323
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,139
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

324
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,976
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

325
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,729
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

326
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,889
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

327
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,978
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

328
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,129
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

329
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,451
Santino.

330
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,013
Come here.

331
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,853
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

332
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,417
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

333
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,091
Go on.

334
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,938
Tom, what's this nonsense?

335
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,815
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

336
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,338
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

337
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,898
And...

338
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,339
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

339
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,896
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

340
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,739
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

341
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,380
Go to the Tattaglias.

342
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,539
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

343
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,698
and find out what you can.

344
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,891
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

345
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,571
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

346
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,739
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

347
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,097
Andiamo, Fredo.

348
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,576
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

349
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,739
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

350
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,570
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

351
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,571
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

352
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,698
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

353
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,254
You know who I am?

354
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,609
I know you.

355
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,816
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family...right?

356
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,616
I think you and I can do business.

357
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,569
I need someone strong like you.

358
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,136
I heard you are not happy...

359
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,456
...with the Corleone family.

360
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,050
Want to join me?

361
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,455
What's in it for me?

362
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,335
$50,000 to start with.

363
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,655
Not bad!

364
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,816
Agreed?

365
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,252
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

366
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,491
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

367
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,409
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

368
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,851
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

369
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,618
Get in.

370
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,928
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

371
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,777
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

372
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,692
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

373
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,614
No.

374
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:14,132
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

375
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,738
Michael.

376
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,855
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

377
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,854
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

378
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,337
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

379
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,054
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

380
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,731
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

381
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,937
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,338
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

383
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,056
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

384
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,096
Oh, my God.

385
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,012
Sonny!

386
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,336
Stay back there.

387
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,577
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

388
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,372
There's more news about your old man.

389
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,174
Word is out that he's already dead.

390
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,850
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

391
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,132
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

392
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,774
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

393
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,529
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

394
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,972
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

395
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,775
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

396
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,333
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

397
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,535
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

398
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,459
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

399
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,891
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

400
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,217
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

401
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,811
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

402
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,090
I'll wait.

403
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,893
Your boss is dead.

404
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,849
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

405
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:24,088
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

406
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,211
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

407
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,899
Drink it.

408
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,410
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

409
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,408
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

410
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,169
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

411
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:58,738
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

412
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,337
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

413
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,889
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

414
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,458
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

415
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,256
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

416
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,971
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

417
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:37,055
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

418
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,536
It's good business, Tom.

419
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,734
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

420
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,376
Yeah, well...

421
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,220
Let me worry about Luca.

422
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,931
You just talk to Sonny.

423
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,859
And the other two kids.

424
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,412
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

425
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,853
Now you can go.

426
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,689
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

427
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,538
Blood is a big expense.

428
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,056
He's still alive.

429
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,809
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

430
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,969
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

431
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:49,010
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

432
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:56,969
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

433
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,973
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

434
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,013
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

435
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:06,371
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

436
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,809
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

437
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,615
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

438
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,371
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

439
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:26,256
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

440
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,456
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

441
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,688
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

442
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,212
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

443
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,058
If your father dies...

444
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,852
...you make the deal.

445
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,576
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

446
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,215
What is it?

447
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,369
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

448
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,731
Tessio, go see what it is.

449
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,450
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

450
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,175
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

451
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,690
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

452
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,460
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

453
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,815
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

454
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:33,172
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

455
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,532
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

456
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,528
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

457
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,129
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

458
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,975
Try Luca again.

459
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,973
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

460
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,809
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

461
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,290
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

462
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,695
Probably late.

463
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,695
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:33,217
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

465
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,055
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

466
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:43,493
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

467
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,056
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

468
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,696
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

469
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,731
Watch the kids.

470
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:08,378
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

471
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,933
Yeah, all right.

472
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,372
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

473
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,539
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

474
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,449
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

475
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,454
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

476
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,657
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

477
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,098
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

478
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,497
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

479
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,855
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

480
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,095
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

481
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,972
He's going to make it.

482
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,576
I love you.

483
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,176
I love you!

484
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,409
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,293
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

486
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,650
Can't you say it?

487
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,172
I'll see you tonight.

488
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,938
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

489
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:20,533
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

490
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,256
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

491
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,930
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

492
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,214
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

493
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:39,335
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

494
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,694
Add a little bit of wine.

495
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:49,572
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

496
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,853
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

497
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,972
You won't see him anymore.

498
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,819
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

499
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,251
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

500
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:06,497
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

501
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,294
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,656
Send somebody with him anyway.

503
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,897
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

504
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,498
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

505
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,055
I'll wait in the cab.

506
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,938
I don't want you to get involved.

507
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,291
When will I see you again?

508
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:11,458
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

509
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,809
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

510
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,979
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

511
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,138
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

512
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,013
What happened to the guards?

513
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:39,169
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

514
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,816
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

515
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:50,533
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

516
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,858
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

517
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:03,616
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

518
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,654
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's all alone.

519
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,499
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

520
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,692
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

521
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:22,612
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

522
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,176
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

523
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:30,339
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

524
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,576
Help me, please.

525
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,974
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

526
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,816
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

527
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,773
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

528
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,576
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

529
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:06,216
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

530
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,456
I'll be out in a minute.

531
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:25,938
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

532
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,170
I'm with you now.

533
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,138
I'm with you.

534
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,250
Get rid of these. Come here.

535
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:13,969
Put your hand in your pocket, like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

536
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,616
You did good.

537
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:53,817
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

538
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:58,059
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

539
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:02,139
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

540
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:08,051
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

541
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,618
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

542
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:16,257
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

543
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:23,370
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

544
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,457
Stand him up straight.

545
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:51,415
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

546
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,895
They're licensed to carry firearms.

547
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:58,935
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

548
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,210
Let him go.

549
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:35,615
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

550
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,380
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

551
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,492
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

552
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,696
Jesus Christ.

553
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,938
Looks like a fortress around here.

554
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:00,495
Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

555
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,534
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

556
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,256
Mike, let me look at you.

557
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:15,017
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

558
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:20,419
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

559
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:23,339
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

560
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,692
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

561
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,892
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

562
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:34,252
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

563
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:38,578
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

564
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,738
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

565
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:45,012
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

566
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,178
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

567
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,940
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

568
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,700
This is business, not personal!

569
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,371
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

570
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:02,016
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

571
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,657
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

572
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,695
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

573
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,973
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

574
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:23,855
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

575
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,530
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

576
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:31,176
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

577
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:36,898
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

578
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,729
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

579
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:46,132
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

580
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,610
All right, we'll wait.

581
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:59,456
We can't wait. We can't wait.

582
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:04,174
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

583
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,009
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

584
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:12,179
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

585
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,976
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

586
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,896
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

587
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:29,810
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

588
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,894
Let's set the meeting.

589
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:39,299
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

590
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,375
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

591
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:48,414
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

592
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,413
They'll search me when I meet them,
right?

593
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:56,373
So I can't have a weapon on me.

594
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:04,299
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

595
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,299
...then I'll kill them both.

596
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:27,016
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

597
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:30,610
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

598
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:36,975
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

599
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,819
You're taking this very personal.

600
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,217
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

601
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:47,015
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

602
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:53,409
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

603
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,454
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

604
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:02,814
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

605
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,499
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

606
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:14,449
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

607
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:22,129
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

608
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:26,777
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

609
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,539
Is the trigger too tight?

610
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,494
My ears!

611
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:49,899
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

612
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,092
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

613
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,448
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

614
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:01,970
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

615
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:06,219
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

616
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,139
so walk out fast, but don't run.

617
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,616
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

618
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,971
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

619
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:22,019
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

620
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,575
and we'll catch the hell.

621
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:28,329
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

622
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:32,010
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

623
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:37,010
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

624
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:41,213
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

625
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:47,290
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

626
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:52,292
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

627
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,889
Your father too.

628
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,970
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

629
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:38,973
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

630
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,933
How much time do we have?

631
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:47,089
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

632
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:53,138
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

633
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:58,051
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

634
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:03,129
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

635
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,650
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

636
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:10,330
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

637
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,657
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

638
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,896
I'll get it.

639
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,331
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

640
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,532
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

641
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:50,258
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

642
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:55,090
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

643
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:00,090
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

644
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:06,091
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

645
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:10,054
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

646
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:14,617
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

647
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:18,495
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

648
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:23,490
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

649
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:28,216
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

650
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:32,049
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

651
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,138
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

652
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,778
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

653
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,369
Let's move.

654
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,778
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

655
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,130
Yeah, a million times.

656
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:02,049
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

657
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,499
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

658
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,930
At least a year.

659
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:19,089
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

660
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:23,575
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

661
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,490
Take care.

662
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,770
Take care, Mike.

663
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:10,453
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

664
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:16,051
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

665
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:20,538
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

666
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:24,528
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

667
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,857
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

668
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:33,373
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

669
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,889
He's a good kid.

670
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,736
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

671
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:47,889
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

672
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:56,489
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

673
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:01,259
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

674
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,053
He's clean.

675
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,575
Going to Jersey?

676
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,169
Maybe.

677
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,054
Nice work, Lou.

678
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:43,139
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

679
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,774
I'll have it.

680
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:22,336
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

681
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,860
What I want...

682
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,494
What's most important to me...

683
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:49,852
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

684
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:54,019
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

685
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:57,530
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

686
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,856
I'm not that clever.

687
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,455
All I want is a truce.

688
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,329
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

689
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,612
When you got to go, you got to go.

690
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:23,859
He's clean.

691
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,858
Don't take too long.

692
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:31,136
I've frisked a thousand punks.

693
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,890
Okay, you take over.

694
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:31,058
I love you, Grandpa.

695
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:35,771
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

696
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:39,498
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

697
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:45,650
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

698
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,736
Go with your mother.

699
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:53,295
Take them downstairs.

700
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:01,169
Go on, Carlo, you too.

701
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,978
Go on.

702
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:27,419
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

703
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:48,489
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

704
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:54,695
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

705
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,176
They hit us, so we hit them back.

706
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:03,051
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

707
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:07,333
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

708
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,610
So things are loosening up.

709
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:17,895
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

710
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:23,618
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

711
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:31,576
Where's Michael?

712
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:46,378
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

713
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:52,618
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

714
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:17,217
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

715
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:20,378
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

716
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:25,176
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

717
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:30,898
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

718
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:34,775
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

719
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:39,735
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

720
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:45,378
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

721
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:48,538
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

722
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,334
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

723
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,457
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

724
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:02,372
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

725
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:06,334
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

726
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,498
That's because they've started
making big money.

727
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,976
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

728
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:17,458
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

729
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,379
Don't interfere.

730
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:24,539
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

731
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:27,459
We don't discuss business at the table.

732
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,219
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

733
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,731
Why are you so far
from the house?

734
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:25,579
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

735
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,771
The bodyguards are here.

736
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,210
It's still dangerous...

737
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:32,980
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

738
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:36,297
Your enemies know you're here.

739
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,572
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

740
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:41,372
Not yet.

741
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,333
It's out of the question.

742
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,375
Where are you going now?

743
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:53,848
Take my car.

744
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:57,574
I want to walk.

745
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,813
Be careful.

746
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:34,972
Where have all the men gone?

747
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,933
They're all dead from vendettas.

748
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,977
There are the names of the dead.

749
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:00,889
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

750
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:04,689
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

751
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:10,733
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

752
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:30,215
Mamma mia what a beauty.

753
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,974
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

754
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:50,768
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

755
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,010
Did you have a good hunt?

756
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,688
You know all the girls
around here?

757
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,334
We saw some real beauties.

758
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:24,499
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

759
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:29,573
She would tempt the devil himself.

760
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,334
Really put together.

761
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:45,615
Such hair, such mouth!

762
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:50,976
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

763
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,569
This one had a purple dress...

764
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:56,214
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

765
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:00,413
A type more Greek than Italian.

766
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,216
Do you know her?

767
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:10,972
There's no girl like that
in this town.

768
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,575
My God, I understand!

769
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:20,889
What's wrong?

770
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:23,738
Let's go.

771
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,253
It's his daughter.

772
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,769
Tell him to come here.

773
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:32,417
Call him.

774
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:54,180
Fabrizio, you translate.

775
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,498
I apologise if I offended you.

776
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:03,533
I'm a stranger in this country.

777
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:07,016
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

778
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,614
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

779
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:18,739
My name is Michael Corleone.

780
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:24,179
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

781
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:29,416
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

782
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:33,459
...instead of gaining a husband.

783
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,493
I want to meet your daughter.

784
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:48,091
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

785
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,373
With all respect.

786
01:38:56,420 --> 01:39:00,379
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

787
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:07,976
What's her name?

788
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:57,248
I'll knock you dizzy.

789
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,689
Save it for the library.

790
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:10,613
We've got to pick up my sister.

791
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:30,254
What's the matter?

792
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:33,458
What's the matter?

793
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:37,529
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

794
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:40,379
It was my fault. I hit him.

795
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:44,937
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

796
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:52,009
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

797
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:55,178
Sonny, please don't do anything.

798
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:58,338
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

799
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:01,338
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

800
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:08,458
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

801
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:11,857
Tell them to stop taking in action.

802
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:14,016
We lost enough money last week.

803
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,616
Come here, come here!

804
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:20,212
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

805
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:07,979
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

806
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:12,173
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

807
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:15,975
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

808
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:19,138
All we know is that he's all right.

809
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:24,859
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

810
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:30,849
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

811
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:36,333
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

812
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,735
He'll get in touch with you.

813
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:42,330
I let my cab go, so can I call
another one, please?

814
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,496
Come on. Sorry.

815
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:05,898
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

816
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,330
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

817
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:11,976
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

818
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,097
Bitch!

819
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:23,135
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

820
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,332
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

821
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:28,815
You just told me to make you dinner!

822
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,539
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

823
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:47,579
That's it, break it all, you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

824
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:59,930
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

825
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:03,293
Maybe I will.

826
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:11,298
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

827
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:15,539
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

828
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:19,415
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

829
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:25,051
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

830
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,337
Clean it!

831
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:33,499
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

832
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:36,976
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

833
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,899
Come on, kill me!

834
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,692
Get out of here!

835
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:44,972
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

836
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,138
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

837
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:01,090
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

838
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:04,538
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

839
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:08,096
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

840
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:10,975
Yeah, Connie.

841
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:17,176
You wait there.

842
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:21,814
No, you just wait there.

843
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:26,249
Son-of-a-bitch.

844
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:29,372
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

845
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:36,456
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

846
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:45,292
Sonny!

847
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,740
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

848
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:56,136
Go after him, go on!

849
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:27,810
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

850
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,616
Give me a drop.

851
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:23,378
My wife is crying upstairs.

852
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,977
I hear cars coming to the house.

853
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:34,578
Consigliere of mine,

854
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:38,011
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

855
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,688
I didn't tell Mama anything.

856
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:45,049
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

857
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:49,890
But you needed a drink first.

858
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:54,052
Yeah.

859
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:59,258
Well, now you've had your drink.

860
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:08,452
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

861
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:27,379
I want no inquiries made.

862
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:33,739
I want no acts of vengeance.

863
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:37,494
I want you to arrange a meeting...

864
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:41,658
...with the heads of the five families.

865
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:45,574
This war stops now.

866
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:08,335
Call Bonasera.

867
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:10,969
I need him now.

868
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:27,335
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

869
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:29,849
You owe your Don a service.

870
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:33,336
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

871
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:38,250
He will be at your funeral parlour
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

872
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:02,610
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

873
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:06,779
Yes. What do you want me to do?

874
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:18,535
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

875
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:25,051
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

876
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:43,252
Look how they massacred my boy.

877
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:14,136
It's safer to teach you English!

878
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,853
I know English...

879
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:21,009
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

880
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:30,529
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

881
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:33,300
How are things in Palermo?

882
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:43,653
Michael is teaching me to
drive...watch, I'll show you.

883
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:46,854
How are things in Palermo?

884
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:49,813
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

885
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:53,376
times are changing for the worse.

886
01:58:56,020 --> 01:59:01,538
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

887
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:08,771
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

888
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:14,294
What's wrong?

889
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:17,498
Bad news from America.

890
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:23,459
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

891
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:31,251
Let's go...you promised.

892
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:51,814
Get the car.

893
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:56,413
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

894
01:59:56,620 --> 02:00:00,010
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

895
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:02,529
Okay, anything you say.

896
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:10,255
Calo, where is Apollonia?

897
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:14,419
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

898
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:18,938
She'll make a good American wife.

899
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:21,855
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

900
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:33,535
Fabrizio!

901
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:36,174
Where are you going?

902
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:40,535
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

903
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,219
No, Apollonia!

904
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:13,978
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting,

905
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:19,254
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

906
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:23,378
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

907
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:26,970
and from Brooklyn...

908
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:30,530
...Philip Tattaglia.

909
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:34,653
And from Staten Island

910
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:38,091
we have with us Victor Strachi.

911
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:43,772
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

912
02:01:43,980 --> 02:01:47,893
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

913
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:56,977
How did things ever get so far?

914
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:59,136
I don't know.

915
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:04,858
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

916
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:10,775
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

917
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:16,056
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

918
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:20,048
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

919
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:24,736
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

920
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:29,855
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

921
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:33,814
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

922
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:37,217
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

923
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:41,098
He refused to share them.

924
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:44,656
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

925
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:47,294
All of you know me.

926
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:53,100
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

927
02:02:54,540 --> 02:03:00,092
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

928
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:04,009
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

929
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:10,011
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

930
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:14,691
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

931
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:18,779
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

932
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:23,770
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

933
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:25,971
Times have changed.

934
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:30,651
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

935
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:33,499
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

936
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:38,854
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

937
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:43,690
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

938
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:47,736
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

939
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:50,738
After all, we're not communists.

940
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:56,178
I also don't believe in drugs.

941
02:03:56,380 --> 02:04:00,976
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

942
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:04,138
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

943
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:11,178
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

944
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:16,932
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

945
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:21,850
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

946
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:24,733
That's an infámia.

947
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:28,569
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

948
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:31,738
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

949
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:42,139
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

950
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:49,658
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

951
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:54,172
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

952
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:58,578
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

953
02:04:58,780 --> 02:05:02,011
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

954
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:05,530
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

955
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:08,095
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

956
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:13,249
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

957
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:15,576
You talk about vengeance.

958
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,738
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

959
02:05:18,940 --> 02:05:21,579
Or my boy to me?

960
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:24,738
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

961
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,938
But I have selfish reasons.

962
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:35,339
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

963
02:05:36,620 --> 02:05:39,498
...because of this Sollozzo business.

964
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:44,296
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

965
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:47,094
Cleared of all these false charges.

966
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:51,332
But I'm a superstitious man.

967
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:57,729
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

968
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:01,250
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

969
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:05,214
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

970
02:06:05,420 --> 02:06:09,379
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

971
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:13,019
And that I do not forgive.

972
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:17,568
But, that aside...

973
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:22,853
...Iet me say that I swear...

974
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:27,018
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

975
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:31,896
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

976
02:06:55,740 --> 02:07:00,973
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

977
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:03,899
Mention it. Don't insist.

978
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:09,975
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

979
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:16,619
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

980
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:25,650
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

981
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:41,730
Come on, Nancy.

982
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:45,937
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

983
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:48,776
Okay, all right.

984
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:03,568
How long have you been back?

985
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:05,736
I've been back a year.

986
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:09,619
Longer than that, I think.

987
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:13,735
It's good to see you, Kay.

988
02:08:24,140 --> 02:08:27,098
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

989
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:32,257
He's been sick. Very sick.

990
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:39,649
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

991
02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:45,018
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

992
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:49,452
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

993
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:51,776
Like a senator or president.

994
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:54,335
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

995
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:57,259
They don't have men killed.

996
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:02,215
Who's being naive, Kay?

997
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:08,693
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

998
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:13,849
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

999
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:19,097
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1000
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:23,369
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1001
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:28,731
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1002
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:32,171
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1003
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:36,817
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1004
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:40,652
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1005
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:45,779
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

1006
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:52,779
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

1007
02:09:52,980 --> 02:09:57,292
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1008
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,697
That we have children. Our children.

1009
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:04,533
Kay, I need you.

1010
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:07,895
And I love you.

1011
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:31,935
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1012
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:35,450
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1013
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:38,618
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1014
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:41,732
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1015
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:45,171
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1016
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:50,215
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1017
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:52,012
Don Corleone...

1018
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:56,492
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1019
02:10:56,700 --> 02:11:00,852
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1020
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:03,972
Michael is now head of the family.

1021
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:08,173
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1022
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:10,336
After we make the move to Nevada

1023
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:14,852
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1024
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:19,019
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1025
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:25,056
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

1026
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:30,493
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1027
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:33,533
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

1028
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:36,413
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1029
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:39,896
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1030
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:49,413
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1031
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:52,418
That's all I can tell you now.

1032
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:54,815
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1033
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:58,251
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1034
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:02,931
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1035
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:06,450
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1036
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:11,336
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1037
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:32,330
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1038
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:36,012
Mike... Why am I out?

1039
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:41,015
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1040
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:43,814
Things may get rough with the move.

1041
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:46,610
Tom.

1042
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:55,489
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1043
02:12:55,700 --> 02:13:00,854
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1044
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:04,973
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1045
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:10,413
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1046
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:14,090
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1047
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:05,019
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1048
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:09,498
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1049
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:12,931
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1050
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:15,529
Let me open the door, all right?

1051
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:27,332
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1052
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:30,179
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1053
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:36,895
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1054
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:41,938
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1055
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:46,099
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1056
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:51,451
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1057
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:54,811
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1058
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:02,738
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1059
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:05,898
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1060
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:09,049
Hey, come on! Scram!

1061
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:14,578
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1062
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:16,771
Sorry.

1063
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:19,574
I don't know. He's tired.

1064
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:28,938
What happened to Moe Greene?

1065
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:33,338
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1066
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:35,770
Well, give him a call.

1067
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:39,777
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1068
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:41,936
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1069
02:15:42,140 --> 02:15:45,416
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1070
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:48,214
Well, I owe it all to him.

1071
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:53,289
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

1072
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:56,219
Mike, what can I do?

1073
02:15:56,420 --> 02:16:02,211
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

1074
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:08,052
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

1075
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:13,095
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1076
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:16,451
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1077
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:19,450
See, Johnny...

1078
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:23,699
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1079
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:27,859
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1080
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:34,858
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1081
02:16:35,743 --> 02:16:38,015
We're counting on you.

1082
02:16:39,743 --> 02:16:43,452
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

1083
02:16:43,663 --> 02:16:45,059
Good.

1084
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:50,660
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1085
02:16:50,863 --> 02:16:52,819
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1086
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:57,969
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1087
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:01,968
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1088
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:07,012
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1089
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:09,702
Buy me out?

1090
02:17:09,903 --> 02:17:15,099
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1091
02:17:15,703 --> 02:17:20,902
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1092
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:24,092
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1093
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:28,740
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1094
02:17:32,703 --> 02:17:35,089
You Guineas make me laugh.

1095
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:40,500
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1096
02:17:40,703 --> 02:17:44,295
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

1097
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:49,291
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1098
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:54,452
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

1099
02:17:54,663 --> 02:17:58,812
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1100
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:02,572
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1101
02:18:02,783 --> 02:18:07,493
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1102
02:18:07,703 --> 02:18:10,931
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1103
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:15,694
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1104
02:18:15,903 --> 02:18:19,862
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1105
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:24,375
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1106
02:18:24,583 --> 02:18:28,291
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1107
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,934
You straightened my brother out?

1108
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:35,418
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1109
02:18:35,623 --> 02:18:37,895
What's wrong with you?

1110
02:18:41,943 --> 02:18:45,618
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1111
02:18:45,823 --> 02:18:47,253
Son-of-a-bitch!

1112
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:52,583
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1113
02:18:52,783 --> 02:18:55,977
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1114
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:59,539
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1115
02:18:59,743 --> 02:19:04,578
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1116
02:19:04,783 --> 02:19:08,375
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1117
02:19:11,541 --> 02:19:16,663
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1118
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:20,136
Fredo...

1119
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:23,298
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1120
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:28,740
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1121
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:42,937
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1122
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:49,260
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1123
02:19:55,823 --> 02:19:58,701
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1124
02:19:58,903 --> 02:20:00,970
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1125
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:03,743
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1126
02:20:03,943 --> 02:20:05,899
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1127
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:08,458
Let me think about it. Come on.

1128
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:19,218
Barzini will move against you first.

1129
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:23,621
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1130
02:20:23,823 --> 02:20:26,656
Guaranteeing your safety.

1131
02:20:26,863 --> 02:20:30,216
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1132
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:37,613
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1133
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:42,250
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1134
02:20:46,743 --> 02:20:49,015
I don't know.

1135
02:20:49,983 --> 02:20:53,498
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1136
02:20:53,703 --> 02:20:57,056
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1137
02:20:58,220 --> 02:21:02,930
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1138
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:06,499
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1139
02:21:07,260 --> 02:21:10,414
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1140
02:21:11,663 --> 02:21:15,451
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1141
02:21:18,140 --> 02:21:20,373
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1142
02:21:20,583 --> 02:21:23,416
He looks more like you every day.

1143
02:21:25,823 --> 02:21:30,132
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1144
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:34,250
Read the funny papers.

1145
02:21:40,823 --> 02:21:46,292
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1146
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:52,257
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1147
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:57,983
What's the matter?

1148
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:00,538
What's bothering you?

1149
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:07,851
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1150
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:24,459
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

1151
02:22:24,743 --> 02:22:27,541
And Fredo...

1152
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:31,250
Fredo was, well...

1153
02:22:32,703 --> 02:22:36,136
But I never wanted this for you.

1154
02:22:37,583 --> 02:22:42,452
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

1155
02:22:42,663 --> 02:22:46,372
And I refused to be a fool,

1156
02:22:46,583 --> 02:22:50,735
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1157
02:22:52,300 --> 02:22:56,259
I don't apologise. That's my life,
but I thought that...

1158
02:22:57,180 --> 02:23:02,416
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1159
02:23:03,983 --> 02:23:09,259
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1160
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:11,769
Another pezzo da novanta.

1161
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,902
Well...

1162
02:23:16,943 --> 02:23:20,822
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1163
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:24,698
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1164
02:23:28,903 --> 02:23:33,132
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1165
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:36,619
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1166
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:54,692
Can I hold it, please?

1167
02:24:08,863 --> 02:24:12,572
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1168
02:24:12,783 --> 02:24:15,775
Over here, over here.

1169
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:20,417
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1170
02:24:25,743 --> 02:24:27,699
Antony!

1171
02:24:27,903 --> 02:24:29,891
Come here, come here.

1172
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:36,139
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1173
02:24:41,743 --> 02:24:44,891
I'll show you something. Come here.

1174
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:48,056
Stand there.

1175
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:53,729
Give me an orange!

1176
02:25:11,020 --> 02:25:13,011
That's a new trick.

1177
02:25:13,583 --> 02:25:16,458
You run in there. Run in there.

1178
02:25:28,623 --> 02:25:30,850
Where are you?

1179
02:28:20,943 --> 02:28:23,741
Mike, can I have a minute?

1180
02:28:32,823 --> 02:28:35,015
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1181
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:39,008
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1182
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:42,212
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1183
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:46,811
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1184
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:52,092
- All right?
- All right.

1185
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:11,378
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

1186
02:29:13,583 --> 02:29:17,892
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1187
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:21,250
Where I'll be safe.

1188
02:29:32,623 --> 02:29:36,169
I always thought it would be
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1189
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:40,695
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1190
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:44,494
But I'm going to wait.

1191
02:29:44,703 --> 02:29:46,895
After the baptism.

1192
02:29:48,541 --> 02:29:51,259
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1193
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:55,132
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

1194
02:29:55,340 --> 02:30:00,175
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

1195
02:32:15,903 --> 02:32:19,973
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1196
02:32:20,180 --> 02:32:21,457
I do.

1197
02:32:21,663 --> 02:32:24,891
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1198
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:26,375
I do.

1199
02:32:26,583 --> 02:32:30,334
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1200
02:32:30,541 --> 02:32:31,817
I do.

1201
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:38,574
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1202
02:33:44,583 --> 02:33:45,854
I do renounce him.

1203
02:33:55,180 --> 02:33:56,582
And all his works?

1204
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:10,853
I do renounce them.

1205
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:13,662
Oh, God!

1206
02:34:16,460 --> 02:34:20,055
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1207
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:38,652
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

1208
02:34:38,863 --> 02:34:40,293
I will.

1209
02:34:47,020 --> 02:34:53,050
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

1210
02:35:05,783 --> 02:35:07,739
Kay!

1211
02:35:07,943 --> 02:35:09,931
Kiss your godfather.

1212
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:38,660
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

1213
02:35:38,863 --> 02:35:42,057
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1214
02:35:42,260 --> 02:35:46,219
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1215
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:48,698
I'll only be a couple of days.

1216
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:06,933
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1217
02:36:08,180 --> 02:36:12,495
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1218
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:24,460
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1219
02:36:24,663 --> 02:36:28,096
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1220
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:30,737
I can't go either, Sal.

1221
02:36:41,623 --> 02:36:46,375
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1222
02:36:46,583 --> 02:36:50,016
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1223
02:36:55,583 --> 02:36:58,700
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1224
02:36:58,903 --> 02:37:02,782
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1225
02:37:45,663 --> 02:37:48,174
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1226
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:57,660
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1227
02:37:57,863 --> 02:38:01,333
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1228
02:38:01,541 --> 02:38:06,375
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1229
02:38:06,583 --> 02:38:09,734
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1230
02:38:11,863 --> 02:38:14,536
Don't do this to me, please.

1231
02:38:22,863 --> 02:38:25,010
Barzini is dead.

1232
02:38:26,460 --> 02:38:28,693
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1233
02:38:29,943 --> 02:38:31,535
Moe Greene.

1234
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:36,415
Strachi. Cuneo.

1235
02:38:37,703 --> 02:38:42,652
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1236
02:38:42,863 --> 02:38:45,294
Admit what you did.

1237
02:38:48,300 --> 02:38:50,416
Get him a drink.

1238
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:58,255
Come on.

1239
02:38:58,460 --> 02:39:03,375
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1240
02:39:04,703 --> 02:39:07,661
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1241
02:39:13,903 --> 02:39:16,576
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1242
02:39:20,703 --> 02:39:25,137
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1243
02:39:25,340 --> 02:39:29,094
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1244
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:30,782
Tom.

1245
02:39:34,703 --> 02:39:38,295
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1246
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:41,139
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1247
02:39:41,903 --> 02:39:46,613
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1248
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:53,058
Who approached you?

1249
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:55,823
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1250
02:40:02,863 --> 02:40:05,420
It was Barzini.

1251
02:40:08,583 --> 02:40:10,539
Good.

1252
02:40:15,943 --> 02:40:19,902
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1253
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:23,809
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

1254
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:30,737
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1255
02:40:54,783 --> 02:40:56,133
Hello, Carlo.

1256
02:41:52,743 --> 02:41:56,972
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1257
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:06,901
Michael!

1258
02:42:07,100 --> 02:42:10,137
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1259
02:42:11,380 --> 02:42:16,170
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1260
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:20,168
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1261
02:42:20,380 --> 02:42:23,338
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1262
02:42:23,541 --> 02:42:29,297
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1263
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:31,138
Connie.

1264
02:42:32,703 --> 02:42:38,013
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

1265
02:42:38,220 --> 02:42:43,500
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1266
02:42:43,703 --> 02:42:47,616
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1267
02:42:47,823 --> 02:42:51,130
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1268
02:42:59,420 --> 02:43:03,095
No! No, no...

1269
02:43:03,300 --> 02:43:06,818
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1270
02:43:26,983 --> 02:43:28,811
She's hysterical.

1271
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:34,977
Hysterical.

1272
02:43:36,703 --> 02:43:39,260
Michael, is it true?

1273
02:43:40,140 --> 02:43:43,613
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1274
02:43:43,823 --> 02:43:47,372
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1275
02:44:05,623 --> 02:44:07,338
All right.

1276
02:44:09,783 --> 02:44:11,739
This one time.

1277
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:19,259
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

1278
02:44:24,260 --> 02:44:26,979
Is it true?

1279
02:44:29,703 --> 02:44:31,455
Is it?

1280
02:44:32,903 --> 02:44:34,333
No.

1281
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:50,614
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1282
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:22,452
Don Corleone.
