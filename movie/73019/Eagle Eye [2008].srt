00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,230
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

310
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,567
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

311
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,404
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

312
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,241
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

313
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,825
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

314
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,452
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

315
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,703
Are you asking if we’re the type of twins

316
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,332
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

317
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,419
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

318
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,712
I'm Tom Morgan,

319
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,299
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

320
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,384
Ter...

321
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,094
(SCOFFING)

322
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,845
You think I'm a terrorist?

323
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,306
(LAUGHS) No, you're a copy boy,
aren't you?

324
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,184
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

325
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,103
But your brother,

326
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,399
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

327
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,609
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

328
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,321
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

329
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,657
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

330
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,493
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

331
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,036
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

332
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,621
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

333
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,082
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

334
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,500
No, school just wasn't for me.

335
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,086
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

336
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,131
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

337
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,968
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

338
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,761
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

339
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,929
Look, none of this has anything to do

340
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,140
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

341
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,350
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

342
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,602
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

343
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,146
So who deposited the 750?

344
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,940
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

345
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,942
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

346
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,194
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

347
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,071
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

348
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:08,117
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

349
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,161
Well, I'll be darned, Singapore.

350
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,122
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

351
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,458
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

352
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,586
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

353
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,546
Latest military spec.

354
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,881
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

355
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,675
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

356
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
I walked into my apartment...

357
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,511
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

358
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,014
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

359
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,307
and this shit's all over my apartment.

360
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,808
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

361
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,770
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

362
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,982
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

363
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,860
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

364
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,529
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

365
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,947
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

366
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,532
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

367
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,700
She told me I was going to be arrested.

368
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,202
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

369
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,580
I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

370
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,336
Here's the thing, Jerry.

371
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,589
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

372
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,424
You read the paper.

373

Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

375
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,519
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

376
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,854
I don't care who you work for.

you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

379
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,871
Yeah, that's what you said.

380

in a decade, ladies,

somebody tell me they got lucky.

Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

444
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,265
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

445
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,767
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

446
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,644
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

447
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,857
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

Do you think they could derail a train?

622

They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

623
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,021
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

624
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,357
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

625

of maximum security custody

in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

627
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,406
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

628
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,741
She could probably derail a train.

629
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,785
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

I mean, they don’t just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

633
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,627
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

634
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,922
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

Our latest chemical explosive.

One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

And best of all, it can be
cut down in size for stealth operations.

This valve is a sonic trigger.

The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.

663
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,737
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique frequency

664
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,156
specific only to one Hex crystal.

665
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,742
That frequency triggers the explosion.

- After the boxes?
- Yeah.

Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

- He was your twin.

- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

692
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,046
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,852
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

696

If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

697
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,689
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

698
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,899
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

699

That's something you would know
about your brother.

- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

- I'm a paralegal.

- Paralegal?

I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

1081
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,401
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

1082
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,071
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

1083
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,032
(CHUCKLING)
And I was not that way.

1084
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,287
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

1085
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,292
That was my role, I was good at it.

1086
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,755
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

1089
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:23,014
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

1090
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:28,311
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

1091
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:38,446
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

1092
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:46,246
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

1093
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,207
I owe him that.
