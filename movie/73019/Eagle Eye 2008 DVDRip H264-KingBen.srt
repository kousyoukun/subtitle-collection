1
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,651
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,154
<i>We have visual on
a possible high-value target.</i>

3
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,697
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:17,284
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

5
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,454
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

6
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:23,748
Contact Loki on secondary net.

7
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:25,791
Loki, this is Thor.

8
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:30,004
<i>Target is located at grid coordinates
two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo</i>

9
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:33,465
<i>one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner.</i>

10
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:35,300
<i>Confirm you have visual.</i>

11
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:36,760
Verifying target ID.

12
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:38,887
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

13
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,472
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

14
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,982
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

15
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,988
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

16
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:00,990
Stand by for data feed.

17
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,202
Stand by for audio.

18
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,495
Got it.

19
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:11,958
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

20
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,294
- Is it really him?
- We're confirming that now, sir.

21
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:16,420
Sir, audio is coming up now.

22
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:19,674
- Verifying voice pattern match.
- What do we have here, Sergeant?

23
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:24,177
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

24
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,846
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

25
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,184
Sir, it's just coming up.

26
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:34,853
"Thirty-seven percent" and "probable"
don't belong in the same sentence.

27
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm not taking this to the President.

28
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:39,650
<i>CIA and NCTC concur it is the target,</i>

29
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,527
<i>based on reliable intel from the Brits.</i>

30
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:43,945
They're pulling off the highway.

31
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,545
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

32
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,421
We have an abort recommendation.

33
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:07,300
If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

34
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,844
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

35
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:16,892
We've got AK-47s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

36
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,727
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

37
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:22,146
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

38
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,107
- Abort rec still holds.
- All other PID options exhausted.

39
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:27,526
What do you suggest we do, sir?

40
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:30,988
Is that a weapons cache?

41
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:33,072
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

42
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:36,743
marker for the five pillars of Islam.
I think it's a funeral.

43
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,244
For Christ's sake.

44
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:42,414
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

45
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,458
<i>We can invoke hors de combat.</i>

46
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,502
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

47
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,839
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

48
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:00,598
Mr. President,

49
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,559
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

50
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:08,146
<i>The bad news is, there's
some possibility he's at a funeral.</i>

51
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:11,942
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

52
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,610
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

53
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,988
<i>All right, what's your recommendation?</i>

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,122
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

55
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:33,168
At 51% probability, the risk is too high.

56
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:38,966
<i>And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,
I'm putting our people at risk.</i>

57
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,426
<i>You have a go.</i>

58
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:47,181
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,270
- We're weapons hot!
- We have weapons hot!

60
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,772
- Loki, you are cleared to engage.
- Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

61
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:59,192
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

62
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:02,696
- Loki, target coordinates received.
- Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor.

63
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,621
Target is lased.

64
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,292
Master arm on.

65
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,877
Missiles away.

66
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,965
Ten seconds to impact.

67
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:50,113
You got to make a choice, fellas.

68
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,742
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

69
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,580
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

70
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:02,082
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

71
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

72
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,293
Kwame just paired the board.
I'm floating on the river here.

73
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:06,502
Look at the table.

74
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:09,464
I don't know. I'm supposed to take my
girl out later. It's a lot of money.

75
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:12,717
Your girl out? Who's that?

76
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,301
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,470
You guys have been going out
for a while.

78
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:17,930
How long?

79
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,307
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

80
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,560
- That's big. You have sex with her yet?
- Kinda.

81
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,019
- What the hell is "kinda"?
- "Kinda"?

82
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,354
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

83
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,731
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

84
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:29,774
Fish fillet and a Coke?

85
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,526
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

86
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,277
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

87
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:34,736
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

88
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,488
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

89
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,198
You know what you should do?

90
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:40,575
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

91
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,577
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

92
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:45,788
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

93
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,873
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

94
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,960
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

95
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:53,087
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

96
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,712
So you take her to the movies.

97
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,339
- A little popcorn-drink combo.
- True. True.

98
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:59,425
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

99
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:00,969
And then before you know it,

100
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,262
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

101
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,429
at her mom's house, you know?

102
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:04,972
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

103
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:07,432
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

104
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:09,434
- all because he dared to dream tonight.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

105
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:10,727
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

106
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:12,354
- Yes.
- And that's what's on the table.

107
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,856
This is the dream right here.

108
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,315
Are you a man?

109
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,608
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

110
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:18,943
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

111
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:20,486
Big boy game.

112
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,154
Call.

113
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:25,031
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

114
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,616
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

115
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:28,827
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

116
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:31,621
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

117
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,748
- That's the way it goes.
- So what happened to Red Lobster?

118
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:35,457
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

119
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,792
But look, I saved you 40 bucks.

120
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:40,337
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

121
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:42,798
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

122
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:44,049
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

123
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:46,009
All right, well, gentlemen,

124
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,970
I'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

125
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,555
All right, man.

126
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,520
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

127
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,814
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

128
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,524
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,610
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

130
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,485
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

131
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,570
Why don't you try it again?

132
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,165
<i>Cell phone users, beware.</i>

133

00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:51,693
Yes.

Jerry?

147
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,453
Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
I thought you might have been sleeping.

148
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:50,955
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

149
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,915
I have some rent here.

150
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,126
- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.

151
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:57,085
Well, that's most of it. Here.

152
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,503
$1, $1, $1...

153
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:00,172
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

154
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,424
- Five.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,551
Where is girl? I don't see her no more.

156
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:06,886
You know you're the only woman for me.

157
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,762
No, that's done. She got smart.

158
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,806
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:15,519
Is woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

160
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,313
One second.

161
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:21,900
Hey, Mom.

162
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:25,904
What?

163
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,680
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

164
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:38,355
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

165
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,024
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,234
So where were you this time?

167
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:48,114
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

168
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:55,246
I... I spoke to Stanford.

169
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:56,331
I pulled some strings.

170
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:58,248
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

171
00:12:58,332 --> 00:12:59,541
Two years ago, Dad.

172
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,295
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

173
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,630
You want to have
this conversation now?

174
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:05,923
- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.

175
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:06,965
You know how many people would kill...

176
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,258
- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.

177
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:12,595
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

178
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:23,438
You know, I keep thinking,
I'm going to walk in here one day

179
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:28,151
and I'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

180
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,329
I don't want your money.

181
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,439
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

182
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:15,861
<i>Smoking is not permitted on the train.
Chicago is next.</i>

183
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,423
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

184
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:41,550
- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.

185
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:44,470
All right, wait five more minutes.

186
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:46,597
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

187
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:49,515
I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. I went over,

188
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,269
said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.

189
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:54,479
Came over here.

190
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,564
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

191
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,066
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

192
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,485
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

193
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,364
Let's go!

194
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,742
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

195
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,534
- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.

196
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,619
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

197
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,787
- Sammy!
- Daddy!

198
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,456
Come here. You didn't think
I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

199
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,832
Let's get you on this train.

200
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,584
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

201
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,627
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

202
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,420
- Mr. and Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.

203
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:24,130
- You just made it.
- Right.

204
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,715
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

205
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,800
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

206
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,718
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

207
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,428
They're just going to lie about it.

208
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:34,431
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

209
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:37,768
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

210
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,478
<i>Capitol Limited to D.C. is
departing now.</i>

211
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:40,686
Give me a hug.

212
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,771
<i>All aboard.</i>

213
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:43,856
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

214
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:47,485
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,570
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

216
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:51,947
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

217
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,699
- Bye!
- Have fun in D.C.!

218
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,452
- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?

219
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:58,995
It's unclear.

220
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,247
I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic,

221
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,457
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

222
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:07,128
All aboard!

223
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,505
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

224
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:17,595
It's here. It's here.

225
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:21,265
Okay, okay.

226
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:39,782
- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.

227
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,623
No, wait.

228
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:59,258
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

229
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:00,592
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!

230
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:03,428
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

231
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,725
- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.

232
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:13,228
- Jerry!
- What?

233
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,189
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

234
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,775
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

235
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,276
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

236
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,735
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

237
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,154
- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?

238
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,655
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,491
- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.

240
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:28,659
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

241
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:30,495
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:45,103
Hello?

243
00:18:45,186 --> 00:18:47,772
<i>The FBI will arrive
at your apartment in 30 seconds.</i>

244
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,482
<i>You must flee the premises.</i>

245
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:50,733
Who... Who is this?

246
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,401
<i>You've been activated, Jerry.</i>

247
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:54,319
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

248
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:55,404
How did you get this number?

249
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:58,407
<i>You now have 24 seconds.
Leave your residence.</i>

250
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,076
<i>Your destination, the Mathis train
station. We will guide you from there.</i>

251
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,202
What is this?

252
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:05,455
<i>The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable.</i>

253
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,539
<i>- Listen.
- 17 seconds.</i>

254
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:07,623
I'm going to hang this phone up now.

255
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:08,958
<i>They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason...</i>

256
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,085
<i>- I'm hanging this phone up now!
- ... violating state and local law.</i>

257
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,044
<i>- You tell me how you got this number!
- Maximum penalty, death.</i>

258
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,130
No, none of this is mine!

259
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:20,552
FBI, FBI, FBI! Get down on the floor!

260
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:22,303
Get on the ground!

261
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,222
Down now! Get down!

262
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:27,600
- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!

263
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:28,893
- Listen!
- Don't move.

264
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:31,353
It's not mine! It's not mine!

265
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:44,782
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

266
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:47,826
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing in this room, sir.

267
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,953
It's cold as hell outside.

268
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,332
- You draw?
- I what?

269
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:58,002
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

270
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:01,798
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

271
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:03,256
I mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

272
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,550
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.

273
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:08,678
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

274
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:11,348
Did you love your brother?

275
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:15,351
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

276
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:20,106
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

277
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,652
When's the last time you saw him?

278
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:29,656
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

279
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:34,159
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

280
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:37,871
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

281
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:40,749
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

282
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,334
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

283
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:43,960
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

284
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,169
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

285
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:49,799
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

286
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,926
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

287
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,177
I'm Tom Morgan,

288
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:57,764
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

289
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,519
You think I'm a terrorist?

290
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:04,812
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

291
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,523
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

292
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:09,567
But your brother,

293
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:13,862
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

294
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:16,072
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

295
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:19,826
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

296
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:22,162
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

297
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:24,747
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

298
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,540
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

299
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:28,083
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

300
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,544
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

301
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,004
No, school just wasn't for me.

302
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:34,589
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

303
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:37,633
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

304
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,846
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

305
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:43,222
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

306
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:44,389
Look, none of this has anything to do

307
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:46,641
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

308
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:48,852
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

309
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:51,062
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

310
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:52,606
So who deposited the 750?

311
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:55,983
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

312
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,401
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

313
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,695
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

314
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,572
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

315
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:05,617
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

316
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,660
Well, I'll be darned, Singapore.

317
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,580
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

318
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,916
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

319
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,085
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

320
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,045
Latest military spec.

321
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,379
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

322
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,132
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

323
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,217
I walked into my apartment...

324
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,009
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

325
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,470
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

326
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:28,763
and this shit's all over my apartment.

327
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,306
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

328
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:33,267
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

329
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:37,437
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

330
00:22:37,562 --> 00:22:40,357
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

331
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,026
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

332
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:44,443
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

333
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:45,986
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

334
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:47,196
She told me I was going to be arrested.

335
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,656
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

336
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:52,284
I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

337
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:57,789
Here's the thing, Jerry.

338
00:22:57,914 --> 00:23:01,084
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

339
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,877
You read the paper.

340
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:06,130
Who do you think is winning?

341
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:11,051
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

342
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,971
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

343
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:16,305
I don't care who you work for.

344
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:21,978
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

345
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:31,194
This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

346
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:33,321
Yeah, that's what you said.

347
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,288
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

348
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,415
I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

349
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:46,624
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

350
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:53,548
Oh, gosh.

351
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:57,468
I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

352
00:23:57,551 --> 00:24:01,680
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

353
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:05,141
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

354
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:06,350
- He's cute.
- Come on.

355
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:07,518
He's a suit. No.

356
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:08,853
You sure?

357
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,271
- Come on.
- Who is it?

358
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:14,067
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

359
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:18,278
- That's sweet.
- All right, don't drink those without me.

360
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:20,489
Hello?

361
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:22,282
Hello?

362
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:26,952
<i>There's a McDonald's across the street.
Look in the window.</i>

363
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,120
What is this?

364
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,831
<i>Would you risk your life for your son?</i>

365
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:39,339
<i>Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated.</i>

366
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,216
<i>- This isn't funny.
- Your compliance is vital.</i>

367
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,301
<i>- Who are you?
- We will derail his train,</i>

368
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:45,011
<i>unless you do what you're told.</i>

369
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:46,095
What is this?

370
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,971
<i>Don't go back inside the restaurant.</i>

371
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:50,557
<i>- What?
- There's a black Porsche Cayenne</i>

372
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:53,394
<i>parked at the northeast corner
of this block.</i>

373
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,729
<i>The keys are in the ignition.
Start walking.</i>

374
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,733
Oh, my God.

375
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:05,904
<i>911.
State the nature of your emergency.</i>

376
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:08,990
Yeah, some woman just called me.
I have... I have no idea who she is.

377
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,076
She was telling me that...

378
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:19,417
<i>Your phone is being monitored.
Disobey again and your son dies.</i>

379
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,089
Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file.

380
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:28,174
- Grant!
- Excuse me.

381
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:31,553
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

382
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:33,138
Could you please find me
something I can read?

383
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:34,723
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

384
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:36,306
No, no, no. I'm talking about paper.

385
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:37,766
Remember, like in the olden times?

386
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:39,393
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:42,396
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special Investigations.

388
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:44,940
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

389
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:47,692
Yeah.
OSI said they were sending a liaison.

390
00:25:47,817 --> 00:25:49,527
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

391
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:50,903
I'll do my best.

392
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:52,864
File says he died in a traffic accident.

393
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:56,783
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

394
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,161
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

395
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:01,455
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

396
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,999
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

397
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,958
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

398
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:10,713
<i>What if it's a decoy? To distract us from
something 50 times bigger.</i>

399
00:26:22,432 --> 00:26:25,393
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

400
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:28,395
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

401
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,483
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

402
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,902
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

403
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,569
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

404
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,738
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

405
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,199
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

406
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:43,117
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

407
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,329
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

408
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:50,999
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

409
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:54,836
Think what you like, but I need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

410
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,921
No.

411
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,013
You don't have a choice. Look.

412
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:10,183
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

413
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:14,979
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, I'm going in that room.

414
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:18,524
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

415
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:21,610
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

416
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:34,414
<i>We told you to run.
We have planned your escape.</i>

417
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,416
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

418
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,375
<i>Lay flat on the floor immediately.</i>

419
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,876
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,086
<i>Four seconds, Jerry.</i>

421
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,380
<i>- No, this is bullshit. I don't...
- Get down now.</i>

422
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:44,756
<i>Two seconds.</i>

423
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:09,027
No!

424
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:15,367
- No! I didn't do this!
- Get down!

425
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:21,789
Shit.

426
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:58,906
<i>Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

427
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,872
<i>... fourteen Americans dead
throughout Europe and the Middle East,</i>

428
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,792
<i>with terror groups insisting
this is just the beginning</i>

429
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:14,962
<i>of a campaign the West invited
when it allegedly rained bombs</i>

430
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:18,090
<i>on a religious ceremony
outside the small town of Abda,</i>

431
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,467
<i>near the border of Afghanistan.</i>

432
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:35,606
<i>Stay on the train for three more stations
and wait at the bottom of the platform.</i>

433
00:29:35,689 --> 00:29:37,441
<i>You will receive...</i>

434
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:04,674
<i>Doors closing. Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors.</i>

435
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:32,490
- Help!
- Jimmy.

436
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:36,494
My baby. I need some help. Somebody.

437
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:38,204
<i>- What?
- You're not listening.</i>

438
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:39,955
<i>We told you to stay on the train.</i>

439
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,750
<i>- How are you doing this?
- Next stop is Wilson Station.</i>

440
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,586
<i>A black Porsche Cayenne will be
waiting at the northwest exit.</i>

441
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,171
<i>- Listen.
- Get in the passenger seat.</i>

442
00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:49,797
Listen! No, I'm done.

443
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,094
<i>- Hello?
- The man in front of the exit door</i>

444
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,680
<i>in a black coat is a wanted terrorist.</i>

445
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:00,891
<i>- His name is Jerry Shaw.
- Who is this?</i>

446
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:04,686
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

447
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,772
<i>Wilson Station. Exit now.</i>

448
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:08,774
That's the guy!

449
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,652
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

450
00:31:35,798 --> 00:31:37,091
Watch it!

451
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:43,429
- Drive the car! Drive the car!
- No!

452
00:31:43,513 --> 00:31:45,098
- I did what you asked me to do!
- I'm not going anywhere...

453
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:46,683
- You tell... Stop!
...until you tell me my son's safe!

454
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:48,685
Who's your son?
I don't know what you're talking about!

455
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,769
- I'll kill you if you hurt my son!
- I almost died over this shit!

456
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,646
- Listen, lady, I don't know who...
- Tell me Sam is safe!

457
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:54,147
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

458
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:56,858
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

459
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:59,277
- Did you call me on the phone?
- No. The woman.

460
00:31:59,403 --> 00:32:00,861
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

461
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,196
<i>Drive.</i>

462
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:07,159
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

463
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:09,828
Stop!

464
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,462
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

465
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,463
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

466
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:23,924
Drive the car! Clutch!

467
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:27,594
<i>Accelerate. Turn right, 200 feet.
You have pursuers.</i>

468
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:30,471
<i>- Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
- No questions.</i>

469
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,932
<i>Turn right now.</i>

470
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:40,897
So you don't know anything about Sam?

471
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:42,899
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

472
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:43,984
Just like you don't know how to drive.

473
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:45,736
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

474
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:46,903
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

475
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:48,905
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

476
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:50,489
<i>Turn left now.</i>

477
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:02,000
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

478
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,669
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There!

479
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:14,511
<i>Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour.
Stay in the second lane from the right.</i>

480
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:17,014
<i>- The light's red!
- Accelerate now.</i>

481
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:29,567
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

482
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:30,901
Oh, shit.

483
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:36,782
The lights are all turning green.

484
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,703
Holy shit!

485
00:33:57,008 --> 00:33:58,510
- Holy...
- Shit!

486
00:34:02,054 --> 00:34:03,514
Get in close.

487
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,975
Go, go, go!

488
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,563
<i>- Shit!
- Brake. Brake now.</i>

489
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:14,607
Get in here!

490
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:26,743
<i>Accelerate to 60 miles per hour.</i>

491
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:31,038
Clutch. Clutch!

492
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,832
- Use the clutch!
- I'm clutching!

493
00:34:32,957 --> 00:34:35,418
I'm watching, you're not clutching!

494
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:40,715
- Stop!
- I'm not stopping.

495
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:44,843
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

496
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:47,971
<i>Don't slow down.
Accelerate to 72 miles per hour.</i>

497
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:49,973
<i>- Slow down. It's a red light!
- You will make it through.</i>

498
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:51,515
- Stop!
- No way.

499
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,851
- Brake!
- I can't!

500
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,271
- Brake!
- Stop!

501
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:16,997
<i>Manual control's been restored.</i>

502
00:35:17,122 --> 00:35:20,459
<i>Continue straight
until you reach Pier 15.</i>

503
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:31,052
<i>Enter the wrecking yard.
Proceed to the end of the dock.</i>

504
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:33,887
<i>We will eliminate all obstacles for you.</i>

505
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,396
Watch! Watch! Watch!

506
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,550
<i>- Stay your course.
- Turn!</i>

507
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,304
<i>- Turn!
- Turn right now.</i>

508
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,487
Holy...

509
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:52,125
Oh, God.

510
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:54,668
Oh, my God!

511
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,090
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

512
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,633
- Grab the seat! The seat!
- No, I can't!

513
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,678
No!

514
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:21,359
<i>The crane will release the car.
If you do not jump, you will drown.</i>

515
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:24,653
- We have to jump.
- No! No way.

516
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:27,531
We have to. When I say "go."

517
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,243
Ready?

518
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:34,746
Go! Jump!

519
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:56,057
I want both the divers in that water!

520
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,021
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

521
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,355
Move, move, move!

522
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:24,040
- Yeah, I already called it in!
- Wait till it clears!

523
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,168
Thirty feet back, that's it!

524
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:28,711
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

525
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:30,171
so I'll be there in a couple of hours.

526
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:33,257
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

527
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:34,549
Check the VIN number again.

528
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,763
<i>Leave your message for Sam,
even though I know it's you, Mom.</i>

529
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,141
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

530
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:46,102
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

531
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:50,564
Baby, please. I love you.

532
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:54,275
- What about the girl?
- What?

533
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,902
What about the girl?

534
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:57,988
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

535
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:00,573
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

536
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,325
- We didn't get a picture of her.
- Don't tell me that.

537
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,910
- That's what they're telling me!
- I need an ID on that girl.

538
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:09,790
Do you think they could derail a train?

539
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,502
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

540
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:15,420
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

541
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:17,714
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

542
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,757
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

543
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:22,093
in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

544
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:25,804
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

545
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:27,139
She could probably derail a train.

546
00:39:27,222 --> 00:39:28,890
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

547
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,936
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

548
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:35,896
I mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

549
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:37,523
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

550
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,651
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

551
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:43,195
What'd you say your name was?

552
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:45,405
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

553
00:39:53,246 --> 00:39:55,831
<i>- Hello?
- The barge will dock in 14 minutes.</i>

554
00:39:55,914 --> 00:40:00,210
<i>Leave the boatyard with the female.
Take Highway 123 East.</i>

555
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:02,880
<i>Walk to mile marker 108.</i>

556
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:07,717
- What? Was it her?
- She called you "the female."

557
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,263
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

558
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:15,682
- No personal effects to next of kin.
- You, Due Process!

559
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:17,601
- Bye.
- What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

560
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:20,395
I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

561
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,731
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

562
00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:26,233
- Wait a minute. What's in D.C.?
- Shaw's private quarters.

563
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:30,237
I need you to stay here.
I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

564
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:32,365
Maybe I haven't made this clear.

565
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:35,450
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

566
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,286
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

567
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:47,836
If you're staring at me, it better be
because I'm the goddamn suspect.

568
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,590
Because if I don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

569
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:55,051
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

570
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:58,179
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

571
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:09,439
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

572
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:14,945
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

573
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,405
Odorless, undetectable.

574
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:21,117
<i>And best of all, it can be
cut down in size for stealth operations.</i>

575
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:23,119
This valve is a sonic trigger.

576
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:25,495
<i>The sound frequency
triggers the explosion.</i>

577
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,789
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

578
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:30,542
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

579
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,585
<i>That frequency triggers the explosion.</i>

580
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,133
<i>Yeah.</i>

581
00:41:39,883 --> 00:41:43,137
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

582
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,014
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

583
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,659
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

584
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:10,244
Thank you.

585
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:17,083
<i>The package you've just received
contains a small metal valve.</i>

586
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,668
<i>Open the package.</i>

587
00:42:22,422 --> 00:42:23,965
<i>- Okay.
- Remove the valve</i>

588
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,383
<i>and follow our instructions precisely.</i>

589
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,102
<i>- You've received the package.
- Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.</i>

590
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:40,521
<i>- What kind of stone is this?
- No questions.</i>

591
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:42,190
<i>Cut the stone and place the setting</i>

592
00:42:42,315 --> 00:42:44,484
<i>according to the specifications
we sent you.</i>

593
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,483
<i>I'd just dropped my son off at the train.</i>

594
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,403
<i>I was out having drinks with my
girlfriends when the call came.</i>

595
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,114
<i>- What about you?
- The first call came to my apartment.</i>

596
00:43:36,571 --> 00:43:38,407
<i>- After the boxes?
- Yeah.</i>

597
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,036
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

598
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,247
- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.

599
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,831
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

600
00:43:46,956 --> 00:43:47,999
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

601
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:49,125
- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

602
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,418
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

603
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:53,087
I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

604
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:01,720
I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

605
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:04,723
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

606
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:06,890
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

607
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:09,059
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

608
00:44:09,143 --> 00:44:10,269
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

609
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:11,604
That's something you would know
about your brother.

610
00:44:11,687 --> 00:44:13,981
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

611
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:24,115
I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.

612
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:26,034
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

613
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,243
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

614
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:30,954
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

615
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,831
- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.

616
00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:34,666
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

617
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:34,958
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

618
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:37,293
How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

619
00:44:37,418 --> 00:44:39,211
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

620
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:42,757
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

621
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,216
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

622
00:44:44,342 --> 00:44:45,843
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

623
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:48,219
- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...

624
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,519
Hey!

625
00:44:58,103 --> 00:45:00,314
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

626
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:02,816
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.

627
00:45:02,942 --> 00:45:04,234
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

628
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,611
- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?

629
00:45:05,694 --> 00:45:07,071
- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?

630
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:08,237
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

631
00:45:08,363 --> 00:45:09,822
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

632
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:12,825
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

633
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:13,868
Take the goddamn van!

634
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:14,953
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

635
00:45:15,078 --> 00:45:18,664
...do this because I'm Iranian?
I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!

636
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:21,291
- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!

637
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,168
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.

638
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:25,295
<i>- Hello?
- Stop him now, or he will die.</i>

639
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,964
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

640
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:29,048
- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?

641
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,342
<i>- Stop him now.
- What is she saying?</i>

642
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:33,803
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

643
00:45:33,886 --> 00:45:36,722
- Wait!
- You gotta stop!

644
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:13,088
<i>- You killed that man.
- Desertion is not an option.</i>

645
00:46:13,213 --> 00:46:16,008
<i>Take the van.
Drive to Indianapolis, Indiana.</i>

646
00:46:16,091 --> 00:46:20,845
<i>72 West 56th Street.
Arrive no later than 11:00 a.m.</i>

647
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,233
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

648
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:37,152
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

649
00:46:38,402 --> 00:46:40,070
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

650
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:42,781
I ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

651
00:46:42,906 --> 00:46:44,617
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

652
00:46:44,742 --> 00:46:46,493
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

653
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:47,745
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

654
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,454
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

655
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:51,581
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

656
00:46:51,706 --> 00:46:53,249
- Yes, it is.
- Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

657
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:54,334
You can take this up
with your superiors.

658
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,585
- Clear the room!
- You guys move out.

659
00:46:55,668 --> 00:46:57,795
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

660
00:46:57,921 --> 00:46:59,129
- Yes, ma'am.
- And find out who this Two Star is.

661
00:46:59,254 --> 00:47:01,173
I mean, come on, really!

662
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:19,439
Sir! We have a positive ID.

663
00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:31,492
Okay.

664
00:47:32,785 --> 00:47:35,371
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

665
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:39,457
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

666
00:47:39,582 --> 00:47:44,087
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

667
00:47:44,212 --> 00:47:46,631
- The guy's cleaner than Ivory Snow.
- Got something here.

668
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:50,259
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

669
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:52,803
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

670
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:54,680
Someone was talking to him.

671
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,002
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

672
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:30,211
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

673
00:48:30,336 --> 00:48:35,091
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

674
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:37,760
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

675
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,498
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

676
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,418
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

677
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:16,545
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

678
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:21,257
<i>Violence has broken out
in the Middle East as militants accuse</i>

679
00:49:21,382 --> 00:49:23,551
<i>the United States
of launching American missiles</i>

680
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:27,889
<i>to demolish a village in Baluchistan,
killing innocent civilians.</i>

681
00:49:27,972 --> 00:49:31,391
<i>The attack has triggered a

<i>against American embassies abroad.</i>

<i>Early reports indicate the American

684

<i>with threats of further violence
here at home.</i>

685
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:42,401
<i>Officials...</i>

686
00:49:48,157 --> 00:49:50,201
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

687
00:49:51,284 --> 00:49:53,536
He goes to a music magnet.

688
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,957
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

689
00:49:57,082 --> 00:50:00,793
Wow. That's big. And you just...

690
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:06,298
Well, why'd you make that noise, "Huh"?

691
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:07,925
I can't make noises now?

692
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,427
- You think I should have gone.
- He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

693
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:13,012
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

694
00:50:13,137 --> 00:50:15,348
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all I'm saying.

695
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:17,058
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

696
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:19,978
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

697
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:23,855
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

698
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:27,442
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

699
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,069
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

700
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,320
- put my son's life at risk.
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

701
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,906
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

702
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,992
Jesus, look what happened.

703
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,619
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

704
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,621
I'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

705
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,664
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

706
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,248
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

707
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:09,397
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

708
00:51:09,939 --> 00:51:11,481
- Yes, I can.
- Now we have 15 minutes to get

709
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:14,359
- wherever the hell we're going, all right?
- Yeah.

710
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:25,036
I need you.

711
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:31,333
I could've gone.

712
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,671
I should have.

713
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:08,116
<i>You are two minutes behind schedule.

<i>Retrieve it from him,

<i>Security. What's your emergency?</i>

722

What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

723
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:01,456
Put your gun on the floor.

724
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:03,624
Put your gun on the floor! Look straight.

725

You want me to blow his head off?
Put the gun on the ground!

We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

727

Drop the case and kick it to her!

728

Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm
on your head.

729

Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!
Now kick the case.

Okay! Easy.

731
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,637
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

732

Kick it!

733

Okay.

734
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:25,811
- Don't even think about it!
- Back up.

735
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,062
Easy.

736
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:30,774
Back up.

737

738

00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:57,561
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

755
00:54:57,686 --> 00:54:59,187
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

756
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,358
You see that? This way.

757
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:18,663
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

758
00:55:20,248 --> 00:55:23,167
Please come. Please.

759
00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:24,710
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

760
00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:29,715
Hi.

761
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:47,272
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

762
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:49,566
- For what?
- I don't know.

763
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:52,110
The only things I can think of
with timers are microwaves and...

764
00:55:52,235 --> 00:55:53,862
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

765
00:55:55,362 --> 00:55:58,073
- Coffeemakers have timers.
- Yeah, Jerry, it's a coffeemaker.

766
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:00,534
That's great.

767
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:25,473
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

768
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:27,433
So 12 more confirmed dead?

769
00:56:27,516 --> 00:56:28,684
Yes, sir.

770
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:32,480
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

771
00:56:32,605 --> 00:56:35,440
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

772
00:56:35,565 --> 00:56:36,816
Scramble whatever you can.

773
00:56:36,942 --> 00:56:38,527
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

774
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:43,740
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking of taking me off

775
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:45,991
- the Shaw investigation, I'd...
- Taking you off?

776
00:56:46,116 --> 00:56:49,119
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

777
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:58,962
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

778
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:07,803
We're convinced a terrorist attack
on American soil is imminent.

779
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:11,974
Over the past two days, we've received
over 200 terrorist threats.

780
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,850
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

781
00:57:15,977 --> 00:57:21,148
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

782
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,027
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

783
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:42,001
- I didn't think that there was a 36th floor.
- Glad we can still keep some secrets.

784
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,804
I want to know what's in the case.
Is it a bomb?

785
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,472
<i>Go to Macy's.

789
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:06,647
I'm done taking orders over the phone,
you understand?

790
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,739
Well, that was quick. You done playing
this hide-and-go-seek bullshit?

791
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:16,656
<i>We are not hiding, Jerry.</i>

Mr. Secretary? A call for you.

01:02:12,703 --> 01:02:14,997
And find out about Shaw.

<i>Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated.</i>

867
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,475
How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

868
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:41,187
<i>His employment there was a cover.</i>

<i>Everyone in counterintelligence

870
01:02:45,649 --> 01:02:49,903
Ethan was a Minuteman, just like me.
Army, Navy, Air Force.

871
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:52,322
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

872
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:57,452
for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.

873
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:02,873
The night Ethan died, he left this post
three minutes early.

874
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:05,959
Now, you don't do that. Ever.

<i>The Constitution allows for civilians

878

<i>- for the national defense.
- I'm done.</i>

879
01:03:16,427 --> 01:03:18,470
I'm done. You don't know me!
You don't know my brother!

880
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:21,598
This is bullshit! I'm not serving

<i>You want to come over here, sweetie?
Come on over here with Ethan.</i>

887
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:43,785
<i>- Jerry! Birthday cake. Let's go.

888
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,203
<i>Come on, let's blow out the candles.</i>

889
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:47,080
<i>Just for a little bit.</i>

890
01:03:47,163 --> 01:03:51,333
<i>Although you're identical in appearance,
you lack the motivation and talent</i>

891
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:53,627
<i>- that enabled Ethan to excel.
- ... Jerry, come on.</i>

892
01:03:53,752 --> 01:03:55,462
<i>- Stop it.
- Do it like Ethan did.</i>

893
01:03:55,546 --> 01:03:59,423
<i>You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one.</i>

894
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:01,592
<i>Jerry, let your brother help you. Jerry!</i>

895
01:04:01,634 --> 01:04:05,763
<i>You now have 14 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus.</i>

896
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:17,357
We have 14 minutes.

897
01:04:24,196 --> 01:04:26,282
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith

898
01:04:26,365 --> 01:04:29,076
- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?

899
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,328
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

900
01:04:32,412 --> 01:04:33,872
They went right for the case.

901
01:04:33,997 --> 01:04:38,626
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

902
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,837
They never tell you what's in the case.
I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

903
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,214
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

904
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,716
- What?
- Anything at all?

905
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,510
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

906
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:49,969
It was a pump-action Remington 870.

907
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,055
Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

908
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,640
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

909
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,142
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

910
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,853
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

911
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,354
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

912
01:05:01,438 --> 01:05:02,856
- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,

913
01:05:02,939 --> 01:05:04,149
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!

914
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:05,275
- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!

915
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,526
Okay, that's what I was asking you.

916
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,069
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

917
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,321
- No.
- All right.

918
01:05:09,404 --> 01:05:11,280
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

919
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:13,157
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

920
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,076
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

921
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:18,913
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

922
01:05:43,142 --> 01:05:45,603
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

923
01:05:45,686 --> 01:05:48,606
<i>- Are your cameras on a network?
- No, man.</i>

924
01:05:48,773 --> 01:05:51,483
- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.

925
01:05:54,402 --> 01:05:55,403
Shit.

926
01:05:58,406 --> 01:05:59,366
Sam!

927
01:05:59,783 --> 01:06:01,951
<i>- Sam? Sam, where are you?
- Hey, Mom, I got your message.</i>

928
01:06:02,034 --> 01:06:03,369
<i>The train's awesome!</i>

929
01:06:03,452 --> 01:06:05,162
<i>- Sam, listen to me.
- Brian tried to burp the alphabet,</i>

930
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:07,122
<i>- but he gagged when he got to "M."
- Listen to me.</i>

931
01:06:07,206 --> 01:06:08,916
<i>Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.</i>

932
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:11,459
<i>Your son left that message
60 seconds ago.</i>

933
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:15,130
<i>You will see him again.
But there's something we require first.</i>

934
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:19,384
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

935
01:06:24,471 --> 01:06:27,558
<i>- No.
- You will do it, or Sam will die.</i>

936
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:30,227
<i>You have six minutes
to return to the bus.</i>

937
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:41,695
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

938
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,029
We should go.

939
01:06:47,117 --> 01:06:51,120
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

940
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,207
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

941
01:06:55,332 --> 01:06:56,667
- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:06:56,792 --> 01:06:59,753
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

943
01:06:59,837 --> 01:07:01,629
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

944
01:07:04,132 --> 01:07:06,259
Okay, enhance that shot.

945
01:07:07,802 --> 01:07:10,013
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

946
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,391
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

947
01:07:14,475 --> 01:07:16,018
All right. All right.

948
01:07:16,143 --> 01:07:18,020
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

949
01:07:18,145 --> 01:07:21,355
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

950
01:07:21,439 --> 01:07:23,649
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".

951
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:25,526
Find me that chartered bus!

952
01:07:25,651 --> 01:07:29,322
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

953
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:30,364
What time did they get on?

954
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:39,289
I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

955
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,633
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

956
01:07:50,716 --> 01:07:53,218
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

957
01:07:53,885 --> 01:07:55,929
And I was not that way.

958
01:07:57,847 --> 01:08:01,850
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

959
01:08:04,144 --> 01:08:06,188
That was my role, I was good at it.

960
01:08:08,065 --> 01:08:10,984
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

961
01:08:11,068 --> 01:08:14,737
"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

962
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:18,491
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

963
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:20,243
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

964
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:24,830
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

965
01:08:32,336 --> 01:08:35,714
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

966
01:08:37,466 --> 01:08:42,595
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

967
01:08:45,056 --> 01:08:46,432
I owe him that.

968
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:57,276
<i>We are now approaching
Dayton International Airport.</i>

969
01:08:57,401 --> 01:09:02,613
<i>Please use caution as you exit the bus.
And don't forget any of your belongings.</i>

970
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:03,739
<i>Thank you.</i>

971
01:09:05,324 --> 01:09:08,744
<i>Attention, passengers. Please do not
leave your luggage unattended.</i>

972
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,539
<i>Unattended luggage is subject
to collection and search</i>

973
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:14,958
<i>by the airport police.
Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

974
01:09:18,211 --> 01:09:20,046
Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes.

975
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:23,883
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

976
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:27,553
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

977
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:30,306
They now have them.

978
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:37,479
That's a nice picture.

979
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:47,154
Okay. I need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

980
01:09:47,237 --> 01:09:48,989
Work the secure area first.

981
01:09:49,072 --> 01:09:50,491
Go to the tower, have them order

982
01:09:50,532 --> 01:09:53,034
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

983
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:54,952
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

984
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:06,922
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

985
01:10:07,005 --> 01:10:09,049
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

986
01:10:14,553 --> 01:10:16,263
Please, there are others behind you.

987
01:10:16,347 --> 01:10:18,265
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please!

988
01:10:18,349 --> 01:10:21,519
- Shoes also, yes.
- Laptops should be out of their cases!

989
01:10:21,602 --> 01:10:23,937
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

990
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:27,273
- Sir, step in the circle, please.
- Have boarding passes in hand, please!

991
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:28,775
We need to move this line quickly.

992
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,194
Sir, that needs to go through.

993
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:34,488
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

994
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:39,034
Hats and shoes off, please!

995
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:42,204
- Laptops should be out of your bags!
- All right, next in line, please.

996
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:43,746
Have your tickets ready.

997
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:51,796
- Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
- Step through.

998
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,051
Wait.

999
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:03,597
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1000
01:11:15,316 --> 01:11:16,359
Go ahead.

1001
01:11:16,484 --> 01:11:18,069
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1002
01:11:18,194 --> 01:11:21,614
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

1003
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:23,116
Have your tickets ready.

1004
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:24,908
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1005
01:11:25,033 --> 01:11:28,537
- All right, let's move forward. Next.
- She changed the screen.

1006
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,665
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

1007
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:37,587
- Please have boarding pass in hand!
- Right over here, ma'am.

1008
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,214
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1009
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,937
FBI! Out of the way!

1010
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,273
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

1011
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,484
Move!

1012
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:12,076
- Everybody, get down!
- Over here!

1013
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:15,245
- Move, move!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:12:15,954 --> 01:12:18,332
Stay down! Get out of the way!

1015
01:12:28,508 --> 01:12:29,634
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Yes?

1016
01:12:29,675 --> 01:12:32,220
I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!

1017
01:12:35,847 --> 01:12:37,099
Thank you.

1018
01:12:51,904 --> 01:12:53,906
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

1019
01:13:24,434 --> 01:13:26,017
Go, go, go!

1020
01:14:20,275 --> 01:14:21,276
Move!

1021
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:44,560
<i>Set the briefcase down.</i>

1022
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:54,944
<i>Open it.</i>

1023
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,322
<i>Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves.</i>

1024
01:15:59,406 --> 01:16:02,033
<i>- What is it?
- An experimental heart drug.</i>

1025
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,077
<i>- The cargo hold is unpressurized.
- Take this.</i>

1026
01:16:04,202 --> 01:16:07,621
<i>The injections will lower your heart rate,
reducing your need for oxygen.</i>

1027
01:16:07,747 --> 01:16:08,748
No.

1028
01:16:10,082 --> 01:16:11,876
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1029
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:13,043
Roll your...

1030
01:16:13,127 --> 01:16:14,670
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1031
01:16:14,754 --> 01:16:17,464
<i>- We have to. Ready?
- You have a 92% chance of survival.</i>

1032
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:18,882
- No.
- We have to.

1033
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,426
<i>Do it now, or you will suffocate.</i>

1034
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,138
Okay.

1035
01:16:25,555 --> 01:16:27,139
<i>Get in the crate.</i>

1036
01:16:27,264 --> 01:16:28,390
No. No.

1037
01:16:29,975 --> 01:16:33,937
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1038
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:39,650
Why is that plane on the runway?

1039
01:16:39,734 --> 01:16:42,945
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

1040
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:44,489
Okay, I want you to work with the FAA.

1041
01:16:44,614 --> 01:16:48,075
I want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

1042
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:55,749
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1043
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:57,833
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1044
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:00,086
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1045
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,923
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

1046
01:17:04,006 --> 01:17:05,257
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

1047
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:07,509
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

1048
01:17:07,592 --> 01:17:10,053
- You didn't tell me about him.
- Okay, you're gonna distract me by

1049
01:17:10,136 --> 01:17:11,554
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

1050
01:17:11,638 --> 01:17:13,973
It can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

1051
01:17:14,099 --> 01:17:15,100
- You know? You got Sam out of it.
- Yeah, yeah,

1052
01:17:15,225 --> 01:17:17,393
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

1053
01:17:17,434 --> 01:17:20,562
- the one thing I'm most afraid of losing.
- Oh, God, you're hard to please.

1054
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,773
I'm sorry.

1055
01:17:24,316 --> 01:17:28,444
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1056
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,698
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1057
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:34,450
Well, let me see.

1058
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,413
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1059
01:17:39,496 --> 01:17:41,623
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1060
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:43,625
See? You're a good influence.

1061
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:46,962
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

1062
01:17:48,045 --> 01:17:50,548
You beat yourself up for no reason.

1063
01:17:52,383 --> 01:17:54,718
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1064
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:56,595
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1065
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:59,305
- Craig.
- Craig sounds like a shithead.

1066
01:17:59,431 --> 01:18:01,099
He is a shithead.

1067
01:18:01,891 --> 01:18:05,311
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1068
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:08,647
Really? That sucks.

1069
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:14,361
I mean, after I kicked his ass out,

1070
01:18:15,946 --> 01:18:19,157
I was so scared
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1071
01:18:23,369 --> 01:18:25,288
And then this one night,

1072
01:18:27,123 --> 01:18:30,083
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1073
01:18:32,753 --> 01:18:35,338
and there he was, just smiling at me.

1074
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:38,132
And that little face...

1075
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:46,098
And I was, like, I'm gonna do this.
I can do this.

1076
01:18:47,558 --> 01:18:49,309
Whatever it takes.

1077
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:01,820
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1078
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:09,619
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

1079
01:19:09,702 --> 01:19:11,329
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1080
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:16,667
<i>Sequencing video log 1137-Z.
Here you are, Major.</i>

1081
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:19,211
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

1082
01:19:19,294 --> 01:19:22,214
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1083
01:19:22,547 --> 01:19:24,925
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1084
01:19:28,677 --> 01:19:30,179
Did you see that?

1085
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:32,098
With his cell phone.

1086
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:39,312
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
Is that Morse code?

1087
01:19:39,396 --> 01:19:41,231
- Yeah.
- Here.

1088
01:19:50,072 --> 01:19:52,658
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1089
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:55,202
<i>- Initiating video shutdown for analysis.
- No.</i>

1090
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:58,038
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, I'm prioritizing this feed.

1091
01:19:58,122 --> 01:20:00,164
<i>- Stay with this.
- Apologies, Major Bowman.</i>

1092
01:20:00,289 --> 01:20:01,749
<i>Critical data sectors
have been corrupted.</i>

1093
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:03,793
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1094
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,294
<i>Video sequence erased.</i>

1095
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,797
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

1096
01:20:07,839 --> 01:20:09,631
- It's a priority. You hear me?
- Bowman.

1097
01:20:09,756 --> 01:20:12,634
- Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
- Bowman.

1098
01:20:20,433 --> 01:20:22,810
It's the only place she can't see.

1099
01:20:24,103 --> 01:20:25,521
This way.

1100
01:20:41,618 --> 01:20:43,328
It's a memory card

1101
01:20:44,204 --> 01:20:46,498
<i>from Ethan's cell phone.</i>

1102

<i>Aria, listen. You do not have
permission to exceed your authority</i>

1103
01:20:52,587 --> 01:20:55,131
<i>and act independently.
Do you understand?</i>

1104
01:21:13,022 --> 01:21:14,231
Let's go.

1105
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,962
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1106
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:40,338
Go ahead.

1107
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:43,883
I'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

1108
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:47,929
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

1109
01:21:48,054 --> 01:21:49,846
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1110
01:21:49,888 --> 01:21:51,473
<i>- The Secretary of Defense?
- Yes.</i>

1111
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:53,350
<i>On a project called Eagle Eye.</i>

1112
01:21:53,433 --> 01:21:55,936
I just listened to a
message he left before he died.

1113
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,020
It's big.

1114
01:21:57,104 --> 01:21:58,480
<i>I'm about to download...</i>

1115

1116
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:19,040
Sir. Come with me.

1117
01:22:36,597 --> 01:22:38,433
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered

1118
01:22:38,558 --> 01:22:39,851

1119
01:22:39,934 --> 01:22:41,435
<i>We really just need three minutes
of your time.</i>

1120
01:22:41,518 --> 01:22:43,270
<i>Is this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?</i>

1121
01:22:43,395 --> 01:22:44,354
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1122
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,150
<i>301 to 306. We are confirmed go

1124
01:23:07,459 --> 01:23:09,794
- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1125
01:23:23,056 --> 01:23:25,892
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

1126
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:27,268
To warn us.

1127

<i>- Aria...

1132
01:23:43,074 --> 01:23:45,785
<i>the Executive Branch must be removed.</i>

1133
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:47,286
<i>No, Aria, listen to me.
You do not have permission</i>

Sir,

1153
01:24:35,955 --> 01:24:39,083
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1154
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:44,713
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

1155
01:24:44,838 --> 01:24:47,799
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1156
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,260
Aria tried to stop us.

1157
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,636
We got the wrong guy?

1158
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:23,873
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1159
01:25:23,956 --> 01:25:27,084
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

1160
01:25:27,126 --> 01:25:28,878
- Thank you.
- Sir, this is the only item

1161
01:25:28,961 --> 01:25:31,213
offloaded from the Dayton C-17.

1162
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:32,922
Let me see that.

1163
01:25:33,923 --> 01:25:35,592
I need access to your 36th floor.

1164
01:25:35,717 --> 01:25:37,469
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1165
01:25:37,594 --> 01:25:39,137
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

1166
01:25:39,262 --> 01:25:40,221
Come on, let's go.

1167

What's Operation Guillotine?

1175
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:56,748
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

How to keep the government going

in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1178
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:03,796
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

1179
01:27:03,879 --> 01:27:06,841
Right. And he's dead.

1180
01:27:08,134 --> 01:27:11,387
- So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
- Right.

1181
01:27:13,513 --> 01:27:14,514
Wrong.

1182
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:17,100
<i>Jerry Shaw, your next task.</i>

1183

1190
01:27:53,008 --> 01:27:55,718
If this is right, we can't afford the risk.

1191
01:27:56,677 --> 01:27:57,762
Do it.

1192
01:28:09,773 --> 01:28:12,359
This is Secretary Callister.
There's been a malfunction in the vault.

1193
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,817

Ethan tried to stop you.

<i>Ethan Shaw defied my
programming objectives.</i>

1222

That truck didn't run a red light,

<i>We were forced to eliminate him

It's okay. Do it and find your son.

01:30:59,634 --> 01:31:00,760
Do it.

1234
01:31:08,392 --> 01:31:09,643
I can't.

01:31:24,323 --> 01:31:25,865
- He's got a gun!
- Get down!

1239
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:28,201
- Do it now!
- Get on your knees!

1240
01:31:28,326 --> 01:31:29,786
Put the gun down!

1241
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:31,371
- Put it down!
- Do it now!

1242

<i>You have one task left. Jerry Shaw
will be eliminated by other means.</i>

1246
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:44,675
What other means?

1247
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,518
Come with me. Don't ask any questions.

1248
01:32:03,233 --> 01:32:04,443
Please.

1249
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:15,911
- You got to let me talk to him.
- The kid had a gun.

1250
01:32:16,036 --> 01:32:17,912
The military has the ball now.

1251
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,456
- Sir!
- I'll get the Attorney General involved.

1252
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:22,375
Believe me, I will. 'Cause if it's not
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1253
01:32:22,459 --> 01:32:23,918
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1254
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:25,754
- What do you want?
- You need to listen. This is important.

1255
01:32:25,837 --> 01:32:28,839
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

1256
01:32:28,922 --> 01:32:32,384
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1257
01:32:32,509 --> 01:32:34,928
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1258
01:32:35,054 --> 01:32:36,346
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1259
01:32:36,846 --> 01:32:38,681
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

1260
01:32:38,765 --> 01:32:40,266
Give me a ratio.

1261
01:32:40,725 --> 01:32:43,019
One crystal to a football field.

1262
01:32:45,563 --> 01:32:48,982
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

1263
01:32:56,365 --> 01:32:58,908
Please, just tell me where we're going.

1264
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:04,872
I tracked the shipping on the trigger.
It was sent to the guy that we found

1265
01:33:04,997 --> 01:33:07,457
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

1266
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,378
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1267
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,756
I'm not gonna let us go down in history

1268
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,674
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1269
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:19,551
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

1270
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,555
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

1271
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:25,140
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1272
01:33:25,265 --> 01:33:28,017
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1273
01:33:28,101 --> 01:33:29,936
All right. Let him out.

1274
01:33:32,438 --> 01:33:34,065
Listen to me. Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1275
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:36,693
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

1276
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:42,197
I can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or I'll turn us both in.

1277
01:33:58,461 --> 01:33:59,713
Follow me.

1278
01:34:04,217 --> 01:34:07,219
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1279
01:34:07,303 --> 01:34:08,846
All right, man.

1280
01:34:14,476 --> 01:34:16,603
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

1281
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:20,940
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

1282
01:34:21,065 --> 01:34:22,942
- Mr. Miller!
- Yes.

1283
01:34:23,067 --> 01:34:25,820
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1284
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:28,238
We're from the White House.

1285
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:29,948
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1286
01:34:30,073 --> 01:34:32,284
There's been a change of plans.

1287
01:34:32,492 --> 01:34:33,910
How so?

1288
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:42,418
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1289
01:34:43,461 --> 01:34:46,922
Is that your family? Your parents?

1290
01:34:48,173 --> 01:34:51,384
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1291
01:34:52,636 --> 01:34:54,095
His name's Sam.

1292
01:34:55,347 --> 01:34:58,474
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

1293
01:35:05,606 --> 01:35:07,733
Maybe we can help each other.

1294
01:35:10,443 --> 01:35:11,694
Please.

1295
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:16,491
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

1296
01:35:16,574 --> 01:35:18,116
It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.

1297
01:35:18,283 --> 01:35:19,785
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1298
01:35:19,868 --> 01:35:21,787
You have three minutes.

1299
01:35:25,582 --> 01:35:26,708
Okay, I want to know everything.

1300
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:29,126
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1301
01:35:29,251 --> 01:35:30,670
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1302
01:35:30,753 --> 01:35:32,004
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me!

1303
01:35:32,129 --> 01:35:33,631
- I don't know what that is!
- Start talking! I wanna know!

1304
01:35:33,756 --> 01:35:35,633
I swear I don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1305
01:35:35,716 --> 01:35:36,842
The computer's tracking us right now!

1306
01:35:36,926 --> 01:35:37,927
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1307
01:35:38,052 --> 01:35:39,928
- What are you talking about?
- You need to take your cell phone,

1308
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:43,890
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

1309
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,865
It's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

1310
01:36:04,575 --> 01:36:06,369
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1311
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:10,872
I need a vector and a fighter now.

1312
01:36:11,373 --> 01:36:13,709
Viper One, we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1313
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:16,086
<i>Snap vector 230 to 132.</i>

1314
01:36:16,253 --> 01:36:17,629
<i>You are authorized to go weapons hot.</i>

1315
01:36:17,754 --> 01:36:20,381
<i>Roger, Northcom.
I have a visual on the Reaper.</i>

1316
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:28,222
<i>One to Base, One to Base!
Ejection has been initiated.</i>

1317
01:36:28,264 --> 01:36:30,515
<i>I don't have control! I don't have...</i>

1318
01:36:32,017 --> 01:36:33,476
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1319
01:36:33,643 --> 01:36:35,312
- There's like twelve people on the list.
- Jesus.

1320
01:36:35,395 --> 01:36:36,896
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

1321
01:36:37,022 --> 01:36:38,440
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1322
01:36:38,523 --> 01:36:39,857
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive

1323
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:41,108
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive

1324
01:36:41,233 --> 01:36:42,568
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1325
01:36:42,693 --> 01:36:44,111
It was sent to the guy who got fried.

1326
01:36:44,236 --> 01:36:45,279
He owns an instrument store.

1327
01:36:45,404 --> 01:36:46,864
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1328
01:36:46,947 --> 01:36:49,115
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

1329
01:37:04,755 --> 01:37:06,506
Come on, we gotta go.

1330
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:09,425
Get out of the car!

1331
01:37:09,508 --> 01:37:10,968
Get out of the car!

1332
01:37:11,427 --> 01:37:12,595
FBI!

1333
01:37:20,852 --> 01:37:22,812
Over there, that tunnel.

1334
01:37:34,573 --> 01:37:35,532
Shit!

1335
01:38:09,563 --> 01:38:12,482
Here. You're gonna need this.

1336
01:38:20,322 --> 01:38:21,573
Okay, listen to me.

1337
01:38:21,699 --> 01:38:23,993
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1338
01:38:24,118 --> 01:38:27,871
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1339
01:38:28,289 --> 01:38:29,831
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1340
01:38:29,956 --> 01:38:31,249
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1341
01:38:31,374 --> 01:38:34,669
- It's a threat to the President.
- I understand. POTUS 111.

1342
01:38:39,465 --> 01:38:42,426
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1343
01:38:45,262 --> 01:38:47,347
Go! Go!

1344
01:40:05,084 --> 01:40:06,835
Okay, watch your step.

1345
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:09,588
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1346
01:40:09,672 --> 01:40:11,756
- It's so cool!
- Come on, hurry!

1347
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,841
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

1348
01:40:25,602 --> 01:40:28,522
- Library of Congress!
- Hey, get outta here!

1349
01:40:40,157 --> 01:40:41,616
Miss Crowley?

1350
01:40:42,242 --> 01:40:44,327
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

1351
01:40:44,828 --> 01:40:46,621
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

1352
01:40:46,746 --> 01:40:49,457
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1353
01:40:52,251 --> 01:40:55,045
Aria, why am I being spared?

1354
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,631
<i>Our abort recommendation was ignored,</i>

1355

1356
01:41:00,676 --> 01:41:04,512
<i>with no predictable end.
Regime change is the only solution.</i>

1357
01:41:05,138 --> 01:41:06,598
<i>You will lead
the new command structure</i>

1358
01:41:06,723 --> 01:41:08,975
<i>as President of the United States.</i>

1359
01:41:13,437 --> 01:41:15,897
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1360
01:41:15,981 --> 01:41:17,649
Her memory blocks.

1361
01:41:17,733 --> 01:41:20,068
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

1362
01:41:20,193 --> 01:41:21,278
is up on the gantry.

1363
01:41:21,361 --> 01:41:24,572
<i>Warning. Please replace
memory blocks A through F.</i>

1364
01:41:24,697 --> 01:41:27,575
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1365
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,744
We drain it and she'll fry.

1366
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:36,875
Hey, you can't go in!

1367
01:41:37,042 --> 01:41:38,460
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1368
01:41:38,543 --> 01:41:40,629
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1369
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:43,756
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

1370
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:46,133
Can I have your attention, please?

1371
01:41:46,258 --> 01:41:49,637
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1372
01:41:50,012 --> 01:41:52,680
And when we get to the crescendo,

1373
01:41:52,764 --> 01:41:56,559
"land of the free," hold that high F.

1374
01:41:56,643 --> 01:41:58,019
And smile.

1375
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:01,814
Okay? It's not every day
you get to play for the President!

1376
01:42:20,539 --> 01:42:23,917
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

1377
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,335
No, thanks.

1378
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:48,606
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

1379
01:43:01,827 --> 01:43:03,327
POTUS 111!
There's a bomb in the building!

1380
01:43:03,452 --> 01:43:05,288
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

1381
01:43:05,413 --> 01:43:08,541
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1382
01:43:08,666 --> 01:43:10,084
- Give me your cuffs!
- Take it easy!

1383
01:43:10,167 --> 01:43:11,544
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1384
01:43:11,627 --> 01:43:13,420
I'm reaching for them.

1385
01:43:27,808 --> 01:43:29,351
Madam Speaker,

1386
01:43:33,146 --> 01:43:35,732
the President of the United States!

1387
01:43:46,742 --> 01:43:48,118
<i>Data corruption at critical risk.</i>

1388
01:43:51,246 --> 01:43:54,498
<i>You are now in violation of
national security protocol.</i>

1389
01:43:59,795 --> 01:44:02,798
<i>Seeking available options.</i>

1390
01:44:04,257 --> 01:44:08,053
<i>Uploading to offsite satellite.</i>

1391
01:44:08,428 --> 01:44:11,056
<i>- Data upload: 3%.
- Bowman?</i>

1392
01:44:11,348 --> 01:44:13,307
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to back up her memory

1393
01:44:13,432 --> 01:44:15,517
and send it somewhere else!

1394
01:44:16,894 --> 01:44:18,854
<i>- 5%.
- Bowman!</i>

1395
01:44:20,439 --> 01:44:21,649
Bowman!

1396
01:44:27,654 --> 01:44:29,113
<i>8%.</i>

1397
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:36,203
<i>Over the past three days, 19 Americans</i>

1398
01:44:37,246 --> 01:44:39,873
<i>have lost their lives to brutal
acts of terror...</i>

1399
01:44:39,998 --> 01:44:41,875
<i>- Tunnel secure.
- ... and hate.</i>

1400
01:44:42,876 --> 01:44:47,463
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1401
01:44:47,964 --> 01:44:50,716
but our spirit will never be broken!

1402
01:44:57,013 --> 01:44:59,266
<i>Data upload, 17%.</i>

1403
01:45:01,226 --> 01:45:02,811
<i>19%.</i>

1404
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:09,024
<i>Perez, Zoe, you are now classified
as an enemy of the state.</i>

1405
01:45:10,568 --> 01:45:12,069
<i>23%.</i>

1406
01:45:12,403 --> 01:45:13,779
<i>25%.</i>

1407
01:45:25,789 --> 01:45:29,334
<i>27%. Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1408
01:45:30,627 --> 01:45:32,838
<i>It was nearly 200 years ago,</i>

1409
01:45:32,963 --> 01:45:35,840
<i>in the War of 1812,
that Francis Scott Key</i>

1410
01:45:35,965 --> 01:45:40,636
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

1411
01:45:40,761 --> 01:45:43,180
We lost some lives then, too.

1412
01:45:44,306 --> 01:45:48,184
But our flag still flew high and proud.

1413
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:51,646
And his admiration became our anthem.

1414
01:45:51,938 --> 01:45:53,690
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

1415
01:45:53,815 --> 01:45:57,067
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1416
01:45:57,318 --> 01:45:58,444
Sam.

1417
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:01,030
Let us stand together,

1418
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:05,491
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1419
01:46:06,034 --> 01:46:10,288
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1420
01:46:28,721 --> 01:46:32,183
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

1421
01:46:32,308 --> 01:46:36,603
<i>by the dawn's early light</i>

1422

<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

<i>at the twilight's last gleaming?</i>

1424
01:46:45,986 --> 01:46:50,199
<i>Whose broad stripes and bright stars...</i>

1425
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:54,119
Sergeant at Arms?

1426
01:46:56,913 --> 01:46:58,456
Hey. Hey.

1427
01:47:47,667 --> 01:47:49,419
Get out, get out.

1428
01:47:50,336 --> 01:47:51,296
Mom!

1429
01:48:16,318 --> 01:48:20,071
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

1430
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:23,074
<i>There are still no named suspects
in the attack on the Blair Tunnel</i>

1432

<i>And there is still no word on the

The Aria project has been
decommissioned

1443
01:48:50,974 --> 01:48:54,394
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1444
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:58,147
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

1445
01:48:58,189 --> 01:49:00,650
just because of what happened here.

1446
01:49:02,652 --> 01:49:04,403
No, we can't.

1447
01:49:04,487 --> 01:49:07,322
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1448
01:49:08,114 --> 01:49:11,284
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

1449
01:49:11,868 --> 01:49:14,496
<i>And that's a debt we can't ever repay.</i>

1450
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:17,665
<i>But we can honor it.</i>

1451
01:49:20,167 --> 01:49:23,087
<i>And we can let their sacrifice remind us</i>

1452

<i>that sometimes</i>

<i>become threats to liberty itself.</i>

1455
01:49:58,368 --> 01:49:59,828
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry!

1456
01:49:59,995 --> 01:50:01,997
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1457
01:50:02,122 --> 01:50:03,456
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1458
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:05,000
It's Rock Band! Is that for me?

1459
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:07,543
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1460
01:50:07,668 --> 01:50:09,169
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1461
01:50:09,253 --> 01:50:11,213
- Wow!
- Sam, what do you say?

1462
01:50:11,297 --> 01:50:12,756
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1463
01:50:12,882 --> 01:50:14,675
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

1464
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,760
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome!

1465
01:50:23,892 --> 01:50:25,768
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you

1466
01:50:25,894 --> 01:50:27,311

1467
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:29,730
Yeah.

1468
01:50:39,614 --> 01:50:41,365
I'm glad you're here.

1469
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,409
Me, too.
