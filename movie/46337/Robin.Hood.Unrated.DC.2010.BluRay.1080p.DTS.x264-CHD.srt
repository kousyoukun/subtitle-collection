1
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,814
Can somebody
tell me what's going on?

2
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,690
Don't be foolish, Walter.
Get him back to bed.

3
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,400
- Bar the door.
- I'm still the master of this house.

4
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,902
Richard, up.

5
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,073
Who is there?

6
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,741
Wake up, Thomas.

7
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,915
Open the gates!

8
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,926
Bastards.

9
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,928
Arrow.

10
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,433
The lantern.

11
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,946
I see you, you little bastards.

12
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,781
I see you!

13
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,296
Thieving maggots.

14
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,173
They've taken all our seed grain.

15
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,552
What are we going to do for planting?

16
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,470
Pray.

17
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,745
Hello, there!

18
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,884
- Here you go, lad.
- Thank you, Robin.

19
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,386
Robin.

20
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,762
The archers been called to ranks.

21
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,889
Bloody typical. I'm starving.

22
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,849
Hide these well.

23
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,102
We'll have them for supper instead.

24
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
Sire.

25
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,332
Your bath, Sire.

26
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,142
For the love of Christ, Loxley,
would you stop them doing that!

27
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,646
They love you, Sire.

28
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,273
My head. It's going like the bells of hell.

29
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,820
Is that it?

30
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,988
One more castle to sack,
then we're home to England.

31
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,451
Hail King Richard!

32
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,871
Release!

33
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,335
Push!

34
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,673
Push!

35
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,259
Hey, archer!

36
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,886
Stay alive!

37
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,179
I'll see you tonight.

38
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,306
Don't forget your money
this time, little man.

39
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,558
It will be my pleasure to take it off you.

40
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,394
Push!

41
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,317
Move up!

42
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,949
Cover the King! Cover the King!

43
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,955
Barricades prepare!

44
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,799
Let us put these French to bed!

45
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,306
Raise the barricades!

46
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,487
Jimmy.

47
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,822
Calm and careful. Make it count.

48
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,157
Go!

49
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,014
Help!

50
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,559
Cover!

51
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,780
Now.

52
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,243
Go!

53
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,878
Move back!

54
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,048
Blood for France!

55
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,884
Go!

56
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,221
It'll make a fine pin cushion!

57
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,348
King Philip's arse!

58
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:56,243
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

59
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,247
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

60
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,665
Push!

61
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,336
Push!

62
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,881
That'll burn all night, lads.
Don't let them put it out.

63
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,507
These pricks will smash through
in the morning, take all the credit.

64
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,426
Well done, Jimmy boy.

65
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,365
John...

66
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,035
Your Majesty.

67
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,245
An English princess
shut out of her husband's bedchamber

68
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,872
by a piece of French pastry!

69
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,791
Aren't you ashamed?

70
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,876
The shame is surely his.

71
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,588
Then go in and tell him.

72
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,799
Mewling at his keyhole
is neither one thing nor the other.

73
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,761
John.

74
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,266
Oh, God! What in heaven...

75
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,394
<i>Mademoiselle, you will excuse me.
My son has need of my advice.</i>

76
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,270
No, I don't. Ask her.

77
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,066
Mother, please, have you no decency?

78
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,737
I happen to be in a condition
that no mother should see her son in.

79
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,284
Yes, I know, but it's my mother.

80
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,411
That's enough.

81
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,912
On second thoughts,

82
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,207
I think it better
that you do hear what I have to say.

83
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,127
Though I will not have you in my presence.

84
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,837
Mother.

85
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,799
The purpose of my being in this room
is to save the realm

86
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,970
from the consequences
of this unsuitable amusement.

87
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,764
Her uncle is the bloody King of France.

88
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,892
- My uncle is...
- Get down.

89
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,645
Her uncle wants her back.

90
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,399
Philip wants an excuse to cross

91
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,570
the Channel with an army.

92
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,239
And you have given him that excuse.

93
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,160
Take up your lawful wife and save England.

94
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,913
My lawful wife is as barren as a brick.

95
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,958
Is that truly the wife you want for me?

96
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,543
Hmm?

97
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,921
You, who honored your husband
with eight children

98
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,549
so that even now
when death has taken the rest

99
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,596
you have a king and the runt of the litter
to call you "Mother."

100
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,348
Better the bastard of a servant girl

101
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,976
than bed the niece
of England's jealous enemy.

102
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,645
Or bed her and wed her, Mother.

103
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,356
I've asked the Pope's men
to arrange an annulment.

104
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,192
And do you think the Pope

105
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,862
will favor England's royal runt
over the King of France?

106
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,073
He might see his way
for the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

107
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,534
And for the future King of England.

108
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,413
Richard the Lion Heart is 40-years-old,
if not more.

109
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
And no babies.

110
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,503
I am a queen in the making.

111
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,507
Yes. Yes.

112
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,426
You see?

113
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,930
She is my Eleanor.

114
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,561
Now, you do understand,
this game is not about luck.

115
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,564
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

116
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,358
Who'd like to take
a bit of fresh meat home?

117
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,527
Caught this morning. We have a pheasant.

118
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,112
Three choices. Right, left or middle?

119
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,280
Middle.

120
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,783
"The middle," he says. The middle.

121
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,870
I'm sorry about those onions, young man.
You lose.

122
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,539
Robin! Over here, they're
needed for the pot.

123
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,040
Feisty one!

124
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,669
Aye, what else we got, what else we got?

125
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,379
The fire will do its work.

126
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,048
We break through at first light.

127
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,802
With a fair wind,
we can be home in three days.

128
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,304
You return to Nottingham?

129
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,183
I have a wife who waits for me.

130
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,145
I have a mother that won't die

131
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,898
and a brother who wishes me dead.

132
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,568
First thing I'm going to do is lock them up.

133
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,362
Your people will rejoice
to see you return home.

134
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,031
And that is a condition
I would like to keep them in.

135
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,158
To be remembered as I was.

136
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,328
My army knows better.

137
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,417
Lion Heart is mangy.

138
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,130
Every man in that army idolizes you,
Your Majesty.

139
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,007
Don't mollycoddle me.

140
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,678
I understand how difficult it must be
to befriend a king.

141
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,308
Come on, Loxley.
Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.

142
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,894
Let us see if we can find an honest man.

143
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,104
Yes.

144
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,189
Let's do that.

145
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,120
Well, that's the thing, little man.
This is not a game of luck.

146
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,582
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

147
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,544
I've got a quick eye. I'll be watching you.

148
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,642
Three choices.

149
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,061
Right, left, or middle.

150
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,981
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

151
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,942
- A fourth?
- Hmm.

152
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,112
I've been watching you
for a while now, Longstride.

153
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,531
There is no pea.

154
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,951
This game is a trick!

155
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,164
You take out the pea when you're doing
your slidings and your turnings.

156
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,582
I got you.

157
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,547
Don't touch it again.

158
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,800
I'll do it!

159
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,114
You lose.

160
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,718
You're doing better than you think.

161
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,553
Get in there, Robin.

162
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,732
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

163
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,650
Kneel before the King!

164
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,863
All of you, move back, now.

165
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,033
No, no, Loxley.
These men are soldiers at play.

166
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,327
Sinners after mine own heart.

167
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,664
Which one of you started the fight?

168
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,334
I did, Sire.

169
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,045
I threw the first punch.

170
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,214
Ah, honest man.

171
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,508
And who're you fighting?

172
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,596
He was fighting me, Your Majesty.

173
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,848
I thought him to be a lesser man.

174
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,350
He was showing me different.

175
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,396
An enemy that shows his respect.

176
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,274
Stand up, the pair of you.

177
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,609
Not you.

178
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,200
Brave and honest.

179
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,331
Are you honest enough to tell a king
something that he does not want to hear?

180
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,209
What is your opinion on my crusade?

181
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,839
Will God be pleased with my sacrifice?

182
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,767
No, he won't.

183
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,354
Why do you say that?

184
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,273
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

185
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,567
Speak up!

186
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,990
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim men,
women, and children together,

187
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:18,370
the young woman at my feet,
with her hands bound, she looked up at me.

188
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,415
There wasn't fear in her eyes.
There wasn't anger.

189
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,126
There was only pity.

190
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,507
For she knew that when you gave the order

191
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,594
and our blades
would descend upon their heads,

192
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,806
that, in that moment, we would be godless.

193
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,933
All of us.

194
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,562
Godless.

195
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,401
Honest,

196
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,778
brave

197
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,364
and naive.

198
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,743
There is your Englishman.

199
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,204
Right there.

200
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,959
- Well done, Robin.
- You showed him.

201
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,961
The whipping will be the worst of it.

202
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,379
The branding iron, that will be the worst.

203
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,672
Unless they hang us.

204
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,300
No. No, this will be the worst of it.

205
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,552
And this will be the end of it.
As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.

206
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,721
I don't owe God or any other man here
one more minute of service.

207
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,872
We go all the way back to the same breast.

208
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,376
Wet nurse.

209
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,669
Indeed.

210
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,588
We've been close ever since.

211
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,883
Good.

212
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,514
Because England, under your friend John,

213
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,601
is a country with no fighting spirit.

214
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,063
I can take London with an army of cooks.

215
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,191
But Richard is on his way home.

216
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,071
And under Richard,
England is a different animal altogether.

217
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,200
Richard will return home
through the Forest of Broceliande.

218
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,286
We know the exact place.

219
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,751
He always travels ahead of his army
with only a few trusted knights around him.

220
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,546
With Richard dead, it will be easy for you
to turn the country against John.

221
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,257
There'll never be a better moment to invade.

222
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,388
Even dying animals can be obstinate.

223
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,475
Kill the Lion Heart
and you will be richly rewarded.

224
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,876
Heave!

225
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,879
Heave!

226
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,605
Heave!

227
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,232
For England!

228
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,363
For England!

229
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,750
I need a physician here!

230
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,794
A physician! Quickly!

231
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,587
Give us cover! Give us cover, now!

232
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,008
Cover him!

233
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,511
Cover the King.

234
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,514
Physician!

235
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,141
Why, Loxley? Are you not feeling well?

236
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,310
Physician!

237
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,818
Wine.

238
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,300
What's this?

239
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,637
- The King is dead!
- Dead?

240
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,556
Dead.

241
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,308
All right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.

242
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,561
We make our own fate from now on!

243
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,482
I'll come with you.

244
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,485
No, you're not. We don't take strays.

245
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,570
The more the merrier.

246
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,572
The road will be dangerous.
He might be useful.

247
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,656
Where we going?

248
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,368
To the coast and to a boat
before 3,000 desperate soldiers get there

249
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,829
and the price for a Channel crossing
goes up a hundredfold.

250
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,289
What about our wages?

251
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,417
If you thought it was hard getting wages
while he was alive,

252
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,335
try getting paid by a dead king.

253
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,672
All right, boys,
collect your gear as quick as you can.

254
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,263
I like the new church.

255
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,684
Lady Marion.

256
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:20,106
I would have been sorry to leave
without your farewell. Thank you.

257
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,568
I'm glad to speed you on your way,
Father Tancred,

258
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,030
but it was to seek out our new shepherd.

259
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,576
You have lately been missed
at Sunday worship and my sermons.

260
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,289
I like a quiet church, Father,
when I pray for a miracle.

261
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,634
Your new flock is women,
children and old folk.

262
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,886
Our men have gone to war
or returned broken.

263
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,056
Their orphans run wild in the greenwood.

264
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,896
Our fields are ready for planting
but we've no seed corn.

265
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,066
And the church barn is full of grain.

266
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,777
Surely, you do not expect the church

267
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,780
to let its corn be used
to plant your fields?

268
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,658
That grain is bound for York.

269
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,494
I am Friar Tuck.

270
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,038
Father Tancred is elevated to York

271
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,874
where I know he will remind the Bishop
that the people of Nottingham...

272
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,753
The Bishop does not need reminding
that the people of Nottingham

273
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,882
should reap what they sow
and repent of their sins.

274
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,178
The miracle I pray for is that
the Bishop show some Christian charity.

275
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,352
As I said, Father,
I like a quiet church when I pray.

276
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,539
You will have trouble
from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

277
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,712
You keep bees, Tuck?

278
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,006
I keep them and they keep me.

279
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,532
Stop!

280
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,160
Ambush!

281
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,072
You're a knight?

282
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,866
Where is King Richard?

283
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,785
Oh, God.

284
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,328
Where is the King?

285
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,039
- Dead.
- Dead?

286
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,500
Really?

287
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,839
If the King's dead, where are you going?

288
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,508
Deliver the crown.

289
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,680
Richard's crown.

290
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,644
How do we assassinate a king
who's already dead?

291
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,239
Bring back the crown!
Kill the horse!

292
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,494
You are English.

293
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,205
When it suits me.

294
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,167
Who are you?

295
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,670
Robert Loxley.

296
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,522
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

297
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,401
That's the King's horse.

298
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,408
Jimmy! Move!

299
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,920
Jimmy!

300
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,643
Robin, they're French.

301
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,894
Ambush.

302
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,580
Go.

303
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,577
John.

304
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,080
Don't know.

305
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,581
He's dead.

306
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,874
Help.

307
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,884
My sword.

308
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,188
Its value to me is great.

309
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,442
It belonged to my father,

310
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,861
Sir Walter Loxley

311
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,613
of Nottingham.

312
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,908
Do you know it?

313
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,786
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

314
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,875
Then the fate...

315
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,085
The fates have smiled on me.

316
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,843
You must take the sword to my father.

317
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,971
It will bring me peace.

318
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,936
I took it in anger and without his consent.

319
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,483
You must understand the bond of love

320
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,777
between a father and his son.

321
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:07,239
My father abandoned me to the world of men
when I was six years old.

322
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,950
I know little of the love
between father and son.

323
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,535
I beg you.

324
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,871
Longstride,

325
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,414
say you will.

326
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,837
I will.

327
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,735
It's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.

328
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,572
It's a scratch, Allan, and that's all it is.

329
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,052
Robin!

330
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,271
Loxley was making for the coast
to meet the ship.

331
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,901
That crown could be our passage home.

332
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,820
We're common archers, Robin.

333
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,781
If we arrive at the King's ship
with his crown, we'll be accused of murder.

334
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,033
How do you know

335
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:37,329
that the knights you see walking about
are actually knights at all?

336
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,874
There is no difference between a knight

337
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,043
and any other man
aside from what he wears.

338
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,130
All we need is about us.

339
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,967
Armor, helmets, swords,

340
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,431
and we make England wealthy men

341
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,268
with horses and gold.

342
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,397
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

343
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,067
And I, for one, shall
not turn my back on her.

344
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,780
Take that crown off your head, Will,

345
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,948
and fill it to the brim.

346
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,372
We commit the soul of this boy
to your keeping, Lord.

347
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,043
We would ask, when he arrives
at the gates of eternity,

348
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,711
if you could let him in.

349
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,729
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely.
But for what?

350
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,356
Nettles?

351
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,982
Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

352
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,150
that'll keep us alive.

353
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,318
Come, Goliath. This way.

354
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,028
Until we get a miracle.

355
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,072
This way.

356
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,789
Marion, Sheriff.

357
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,259
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow,
waiting in vain

358
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,803
for Sir Walter to receive me.

359
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,724
Kindly tell him I have better things to do
than haunt his threshold.

360
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,519
That you have,
while robbers are roaming free in Sherwood.

361
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,854
That's sheriff's business.
Why don't you look to it?

362
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,148
Tell the old fool that next
time, I'll break his door down.

363
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,858
And if he's too proud to pay...

364
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,944
No, no, no, no. He's not too proud.

365
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,529
He's too poor.

366
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,990
In the name of King Richard,
you have stripped our wealth

367
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,449
to pay for foreign adventures.

368
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,244
Whilst at home, the Church,
in the name of the merciful God,

369
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,453
has reaped, without mercy,

370
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,790
the largest share of what we
had set aside to feed ourselves.

371
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,377
Between a sheriff and a bishop,
I wouldn't care to judge

372
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,671
who's the greater curse
on honest English folk.

373
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,049
Marion,

374
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,136
why, oh, why do you make an enemy of me

375
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,388
when you have the means
to make me your protector?

376
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,140
What means?

377
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,730
If you leave now,

378
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,316
I will lengthen your life
by not telling my husband

379
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,943
of your visit when he returns home.

380
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,946
Your husband? After 10 years?

381
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,493
If he's not dead, he's rutting his way
through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

382
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,038
So speaks a man of experience.

383
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,956
Well, think on it, Marion.

384
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,917
Sir Walter is dying without an heir.

385
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,963
Peper Harow will fall to the crown,
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

386
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,007
You'll be glad to come to me then.

387
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,876
Captain, there.

388
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,941
Sir, we were told
to expect 12 riders and the King.

389
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,944
Our beloved King is dead.

390
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,157
Long live the King.

391
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,784
And you are, sir?

392
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:49,915
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham. And you?

393
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,501
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

394
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,963
Come aboard, gentlemen, before the
tide floats her. It's coming in fast.

395
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,937
<i>And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry, boys</i>

396
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,232
<i>We got a long way to go</i>

397
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:19,236
<i>Where we'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

398
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,282
<i>And row, me bully boys, row</i>

399
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:28,328
<i>And it's row, me bully boys
We're in a hurry boys</i>

400
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,832
<i>We got a long way to go</i>

401
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,461
<i>We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

402
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:39,423
<i>And row, me bully boys, row</i>

403
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,055
So what's the plan in the morning?

404
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,310
The boat stops at Gravesend
on the way to London.

405
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,855
We'll leave the honor of returning
the crown to them, and we'll be gone.

406
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,440
Where?

407
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,484
North.

408
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,070
Well, that suits me.

409
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,908
<i>Row, me bully boys, row</i>

410
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,827
<i>But now we're returning
So lock up your daughters</i>

411
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:32,726
<i>We'll sing and we'll dance
And bid farewell to France</i>

412
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,813
<i>And it's row, me bully boys, row</i>

413
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,192
Make ready, Sir Robert.
We dock in 20 minutes.

414
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,860
Gravesend?

415
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,406
No, My Lord.
The palace docks, Tower of London.

416
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,833
Will.

417
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,669
John. Allan.

418
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,548
- Where are we?
- London.

419
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,174
Holy Christ!

420
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,636
We dock in 10 minutes.

421
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,264
When this is done, be ready to ride.

422
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,266
What if... What if Loxley is known

423
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,435
to the King's mother or brother
or any of them?

424
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,520
Then we'll be riding for our lives.

425
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:02,024
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Peter and Paul and Mary!

426
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,609
I knew it! I knew it!

427
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,695
Good morning, My Lord.

428
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,282
Some words of advice
on this tragic occasion.

429
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,619
You appreciate
everything must be done correctly,

430
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,747
so you will present the crown
to Lady Eleanor.

431
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,373
You will go down on the right knee.

432
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,336
Do not look in her eyes
when you tell her the King is no more.

433
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,214
And do not rise until all others rise.
Do you understand?

434
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,382
Yes.

435
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,312
Agnes.

436
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,106
My blue and gold brocade.

437
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,316
Yes, My Lady.

438
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,964
Part for the Queen.

439
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,424
Part for the Queen.

440
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,575
Cease.

441
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,932
What's this? What's happening?

442
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,226
King Richard returns from France, My Lord.

443
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,858
Did Loxley deceive us?

444
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,144
Kneel.

445
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,402
Long life, my son.

446
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,280
Rise now.

447
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,952
A king is dead.

448
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,498
Long live the King.

449
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,126
Long live the King!

450
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,923
Long live the King!

451
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,758
Rise.

452
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,097
You...

453
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,392
I don't know you.

454
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,687
Robert Loxley, Sire, of Nottingham.

455
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,190
Welcome then.

456
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,943
And how did my brother die?

457
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,696
In battle, Your Majesty, as was his way.

458
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,407
As was his way.

459
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,368
You deserve a reward...

460
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
Let's get the horses.

461
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,079
For bringing home the news.

462
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,457
Kneel.

463
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,341
Did you say you were from Nottingham?

464
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:58,885
Yes.

465
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,682
Your father, Sir Walter,

466
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,018
owes tax to the crown.

467
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,314
My crown.

468
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,984
Tell him it's bloody expensive
running a country

469
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,152
and everyone's got to pay their way.

470
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,946
We'll start with this.

471
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,658
Make way for the King!

472
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,660
Make way!

473
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,911
Your Majesty.

474
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,872
Make way for the King!

475
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,087
- Make way!
- Godfrey.

476
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,674
Godfrey, my friend. It's so good to see you.

477
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,176
- How were your travels?
- Good, Sire.

478
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,512
What happened to your face?

479
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,473
A hunting accident. It's nothing.

480
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,602
- Frightening.
- Your Majesty.

481
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,188
Call it a dueling scar.
The ladies will love you all the more.

482
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,191
I bow to your knowledge of the ladies, Sire.

483
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,323
You can get up now.

484
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,207
Sir Robert.

485
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,881
You will know of me, perhaps.

486
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,507
I'm William Marshal.

487
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,219
Your father and I were
young men together.

488
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,347
Tell him I'm coming to visit him soon,

489
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,515
on spring's first black night.

490
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,394
I may have need of him.

491
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,730
I will. I'll tell him.

492
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,903
Whoever he is and whatever he is,
he knows too much.

493
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,407
Get rid of him.

494
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,464
Come on, let's follow.

495
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,320
Forfeit what you got.

496
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,490
Victuals, coin, clothing

497
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,034
or your life.

498
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,496
Thomas Cooper.

499
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,665
Is that you?

500
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,755
Are you sick, Thomas?

501
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,132
We're all sick.

502
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,094
- Where are the rest of you?
- Don't... Don't tell her.

503
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,596
Loop will be angry.

504
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,514
No, it's your mother
who's going to be angry.

505
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,643
Now, either you come with me,
or I come with you.

506
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,062
You choose.

507
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,815
Well, come on then. Where are they?

508
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,401
Answer me.

509
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,869
Four men, five horses, one gray.

510
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,663
Have you seen them?

511
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,831
That way.

512
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:48,216
<i>The living king of sermons</i>

513
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,885
<i>Was delivered from his evil</i>

514
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,848
<i>But he couldn't talk his last</i>

515
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,225
<i>Because God took out his throat</i>

516
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,938
<i>God's crossbow took out his throat</i>

517
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,441
By Christ! Can you not sing a happy tune?

518
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:11,489
Sing a foot-stomper about adventure
and daring and courage.

519
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:15,076
No. Sing something about a woman.

520
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,745
A large woman.

521
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,499
<i>Fancy army, darling
I loves you all to bits</i>

522
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,836
<i>I'll climb up to your chamber
And under your mountainous...</i>

523
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,505
Right. I'm done. The money's divided.

524
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,841
And so should we be.

525
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,384
Where will you go?

526
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,265
I think something is owed
for this good fortune,

527
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,850
and I mean to pay it back.

528
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,143
How so?

529
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,772
The inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.

530
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,568
Maybe it's just my
imagination, I don't know.

531
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:52,113
But I intend to take that sword
back to its owner

532
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,948
and fulfill the request of his dying son.

533
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,200
Are you mad?

534
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,785
You just said we were in danger, Robin.

535
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,830
Now you choose to step back
in to harm's way?

536
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,833
They're bound to go there and find you.

537
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:08,004
We can't repay our good luck
with bad grace. It invites darkness.

538
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,719
- I'm going with you.
- And I, Robin.

539
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,387
- Yes.
- No.

540
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,766
Tonight is our last in company.

541
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,810
Tomorrow, we go our separate ways.

542
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,357
Pack up your share. We eat and sleep.

543
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,443
Will, you're on first watch.

544
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,673
Will.

545
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,663
Watch your step!

546
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,665
One of them got away.

547
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,753
Bastards! They've stolen my fortune.

548
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,506
Richard's army is coming home.

549
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,383
It costs money to keep it together.

550
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,760
Marshal, you speak for the money.

551
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,011
I do, Sire.

552
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,556
But to disband the army
could cost more than to keep it.

553
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,189
King Richard's campaigns were costly.
And the expected returns...

554
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,524
What is that to me, Marshal?

555
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,819
My brother's troubles are over!

556
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,697
They're over!

557
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:42,992
Clear the room.

558
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,757
So... Taxation.

559
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,008
Taxation?

560
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:03,429
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing
but kicked off the milking stool.

561
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,640
Mother, spare me your farmyard memories.

562
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,392
You have none,
and I don't understand them.

563
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,228
These are difficult times.

564
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,146
We can buy time.

565
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,899
I can send envoys to secure loans.

566
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,860
There are money chests from Sicily
to Normandy if you know where to look.

567
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,029
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

568
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,906
Your master's a king.

569
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,951
The crown is owed money at home.

570
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:29,247
The northern barons plead poverty,
but that's always been the song of rich men.

571
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,166
So, what's to be done?

572
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,018
Give me leave, Sire, to go north
with a company of mounted men.

573
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,896
I'll have the merchants and landowners
fill your coffers

574
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,982
or their coffins.

575
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,484
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

576
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,612
No man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.

577
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:07,201
And loyalty means paying your share
in the defense of the realm.

578
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,912
That's well said.

579
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,498
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

580
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,168
Mother?

581
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:20,339
Richard commanded loyalty
not by threats but by example.

582
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,593
Mother, your sainted son was an imbecile.

583
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:29,015
And you supported his every folly
from here to Jerusalem and back.

584
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,852
Yes, you worshipped him

585
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,814
when the warrior lost territories
hard won by his father.

586
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,108
You kissed his picture

587
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,445
while England had to pay
four years' revenue

588
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,197
to ransom him when he was captured.

589
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,782
You are just as much to blame as anyone

590
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,243
for the wreckage which is my inheritance.

591
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,968
I broke her skin more than she did mine.

592
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,894
Chancellor.

593
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,360
Marshal,

594
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,782
you served my brother faithfully
and my father before him.

595
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,203
I think you've spent enough time
with my family

596
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,872
and, no doubt,
would like to spend more with your own.

597
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,252
Therefore, and with regret,

598
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,214
I accept your resignation
of all your offices and matters of state.

599
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,885
The ring.

600
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,395
Your Majesty.

601
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,209
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot
where you would place your dagger.

602
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,637
For I will choose carefully, as well.

603
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,579
Open the gates!

604
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,908
Nottingham.

605
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,577
Is this your people, Robin?

606
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,995
I don't know. Might be.

607
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,832
They don't look much,
these Middle Englanders.

608
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,543
Well, they've been keeping your lot
in place easy enough, haven't they?

609
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,463
I hear that you Welsh boys,
you live on leeks.

610
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,840
You co-habit with sheep.

611
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,095
Bloody Scottish mule.

612
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,308
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive
with your noise, would you?

613
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,310
Your swords would be
no good then, gentlemen.

614
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,686
You're the town beekeeper?

615
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,774
Bless you, no. I'm the
friar. Tuck's the name.

616
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,734
Well, Friar Tuck,

617
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,320
can you tell me where I
might find Sir Walter Loxley?

618
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,823
If he's not up at Peper Harow...

619
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,201
How long will your business take?

620
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,332
Stay safe.

621
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,334
God be with you all.

622
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,634
That's it?

623
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,177
After 10 years?

624
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,640
Good Friar, where can a man get, well,

625
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,851
moderately insensible
on a drink around here?

626
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,354
Allan, he's a man of the
cloth. I'm sorry, Friar.

627
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,023
Have you coin?

628
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,191
I have coin.

629
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,943
Two pieces.

630
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,862
Each.

631
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,949
Have you tried the honey liquor
we call mead?

632
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,453
Come with me.

633
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,372
Gives a man a halo, does mead.

634
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,155
Girl.

635
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,199
Girl?

636
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,581
Either you're going blind
or you're looking for charity.

637
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,042
Are you the keeper of this house?

638
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,336
In a manner of speaking, yes.

639
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,546
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

640
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,300
And you are?

641
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,635
Robin Longstride.

642
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,678
Plain Robin Longstride? No Sir?

643
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,264
No, ma'am. No Sir.

644
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,102
Are you here about the tax?

645
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,399
No, I'm here to bring him his sword.
His son's dead.

646
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,111
This way.

647
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,885
He'll take your horse.

648
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:52,982
Marion!

649
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,942
Marion!

650
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,403
Maggie, where is she?

651
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,239
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

652
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,700
I know, Margaret. I can hear him.

653
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,244
Tell him we have a guest.

654
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,007
I'm Marion Loxley. Robert's wife.

655
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,097
My Lady, I owe you an apology.
If I'd have known...

656
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,642
Bad news is bad news
no matter how it comes.

657
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:34,356
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking the time
to deliver it here yourself.

658
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,693
Did you fight alongside my husband?

659
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,404
Yes.

660
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,157
Did he die well?

661
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,579
In an ambush, ma'am.

662
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,207
He was the man chosen
to bring home Richard's crown.

663
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,501
Marion, who is here?

664
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,588
A traveler, Walter.

665
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,638
This news will go very hard on him.

666
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,805
Bring him in.

667
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,140
Yes, yes.

668
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,933
Tell him Robert is in the Holy Land,

669
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,894
sends his love and will return soon.

670
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,230
Marion, our traveler will be thirsty.

671
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,485
Travelers are always
thirsty. Is that not so?

672
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,611
Your name, sir?

673
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,906
Longstride. Robin Longstride.

674
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,660
Do you mock me?

675
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,579
Sir?

676
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,123
Your son,

677
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,710
he asked me to bring you this.

678
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,682
And how does Robert defend himself
if he has no sword?

679
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,100
Hmm?

680
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,186
The prodigal son will not return after all.

681
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:01,026
So, no tears, no
forgiveness from his father.

682
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,074
No amends to be made.

683
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,418
Did you see him die?

684
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,964
I was with him when he passed.

685
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,968
His final words were for the love and bond
between a father and son.

686
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,846
Forgive my rudeness.

687
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,808
My grief has been waiting for this day.

688
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:37,020
So come, so that I may see you.

689
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,496
Robin Longstride.

690
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,084
A common enough but noble Saxon name.

691
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,339
So, you will dine with us.

692
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,260
But first, you must bathe, sir.

693
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,803
You stink.

694
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,937
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.

695
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,275
My Lady,

696
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,651
I'll need some help with the chain mail.

697
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,739
Winifred.

698
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:35,120
Winifred.

699
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,216
The coif has a clasp
at the nape of the neck.

700
01:04:56,684 --> 01:05:00,687
If you take off the coif, you'll find
lacings in the back of the tabard.

701
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,767
Thank you.

702
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,602
I'll have it washed.

703
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,705
Marion, more wine.

704
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,629
You've taken a long
road to bring this to me.

705
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:11,091
I cannot decide
whether that makes you trustworthy...

706
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,467
Or manipulative.

707
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,721
Marion, I'm merely trying to gauge

708
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,473
the quality of the man we have as our guest.

709
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,434
Is he handsome?

710
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,311
Yes.

711
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:27,816
In the way that yeomen sometimes are
when they are sober.

712
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,819
Entertain us
with a tale of your life, sir.

713
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,156
We don't get many visitors anymore.

714
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,992
Except tax collectors and other beggars.

715
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:41,038
I don't know where I'm from.
Only know where I've been.

716
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:44,499
So, Marion,
what color are his eyes?

717
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,169
Hmm?

718
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,214
I don't yet know.

719
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:56,595
I have a proposal for you, young man.

720
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:01,266
You brought me this sword,
which has great meaning.

721
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,310
If you give me your time,

722
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,687
it is yours.

723
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,525
I could stay for a day, or more.

724
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,529
I have a question to ask you.

725
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,865
And what is your question?

726
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,952
The words on the hilt of the sword,
what do they mean?

727
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:25,832
Well, I think I have much to tell you
about history. About your history.

728
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,299
That's very kind.

729
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,552
Well, you haven't heard the other half
of my proposal yet.

730
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:41,640
I want you to stay in Nottingham
and, for the time being,

731
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,852
become my returned son,
and therefore Marion's spouse.

732
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,187
Oh, that's enough!

733
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,814
- You've had too much to drink.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

734
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:53,235
We both know that without a husband
you will lose this land when I die.

735
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,570
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

736
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,573
- No.
- No, so if I say this is my son,

737
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:04,079
he will be seen as that.
And, so, as your husband. Huh?

738
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,914
It is a fair contract.

739
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:11,128
It is not as if I expect you
to have children or...

740
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:15,215
No, the sword for your time, Longstride.

741
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,591
Are you in agreement? Hmm?

742
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:19,678
Yes.

743
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,430
Marion, go tell the staff

744
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:26,017
that my son has arrived
and our home is now whole again.

745
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,771
Tell them to ring the church bells
in celebration.

746
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,482
And more wine, please.

747
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,578
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

748
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,042
<i>I rose up in the morning</i>

749
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,336
<i>And I felt a dire need</i>

750
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,923
<i>To dream away the dreary day
and down a cup of mead</i>

751
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,092
<i>I felt the sting of honeybees</i>

752
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,844
Home brew.

753
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,600
If I wasn't the village priest,
I'd try for the village drunkard.

754
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,853
Oh, great.

755
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,356
A man could get
very affectionate here.

756
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:18,904
I haven't seen so many women
for so few men outside a nunnery.

757
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:24,117
The secret to success
is never go for the prettiest one.

758
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,078
Start with the homely one on the left.

759
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,292
Right there.

760
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,754
She's about my size.
I'm going to make her smile.

761
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,132
I'm going to make you smile!

762
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,675
Come over here!

763
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,678
So, why do they call you Little John?

764
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,222
What are you trying to get at?

765
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,724
I'm proportionate.

766
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,519
<i>So roll another barrel to the bar</i>

767
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,356
<i>And pour another cup or two
so I can soak my heart</i>

768
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,614
Stop it.

769
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,411
What did I tell you?

770
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,798
It seems we are to share my chamber.

771
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,093
A ruse to convince the servants.

772
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,514
Well, if the aim is deception,

773
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:15,437
should you not be addressing me as
"My husband," or, "My dear"?

774
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,648
Don't be ridiculous.

775
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,613
Well, are you coming or not?

776
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,035
Ask me nicely.

777
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:41,796
Please, dear husband,
will you share my chamber?

778
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,668
Here.

779
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,423
I sleep with a dagger.

780
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:29,427
If you so much as move to touch me,
I will sever your manhood.

781
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:30,762
You understand?

782
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,180
Thanks for the warning.

783
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,355
Hello, dogs.

784
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,263
Godfrey.

785
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,567
Where are your men?

786
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,820
They're dead, My Lord.

787
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,072
And Loxley?

788
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,532
Alive.

789
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,578
Then fate has left him to me.

790
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:16,928
I hear a man's steps. Good morning, my son.

791
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:18,847
Morning, Walter.

792
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,057
Father.

793
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,143
Father.

794
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,229
So what is it that you know of my history?

795
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,564
Patience.

796
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,526
You must show yourself today.
Wear your sword.

797
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,279
Marion.

798
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,364
I'm here, Walter.

799
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:40,243
Reacquaint your husband
with his village and his people.

800
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:44,497
I'll see to the horses.

801
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,624
I feel invigorated.

802
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:49,919
I woke this morning with a tumescent glow.

803
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:51,754
Eighty-four.

804
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,132
A miracle.

805
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:58,678
I've always wondered
at the private conversations of men.

806
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,431
Husband.

807
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,620
This is rich country.

808
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,206
Where's your cattle and your sheep?

809
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:30,251
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.
We've had seven lean years.

810
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,129
Our meat now is rabbit

811
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,882
or wild pig on a lucky day.

812
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:36,966
And deer?

813
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:41,512
If you're willing to risk your neck
to the King's executioner.

814
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,557
Every deer in the land
belongs to His Majesty.

815
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:47,185
These things are God's gifts first
before the King's possessions.

816
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,814
If it's illegal for a
man to fend for himself

817
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,650
how then can he be a man in his own right?

818
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,735
Welcome home, sir.

819
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:56,861
Sir Robert.

820
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,988
Good morning, Joseph. Emma.

821
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:04,285
Sir Walter is our Lord, and you
are Robert returned and you should act so.

822
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,040
Sir Robert. You remember me?

823
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,834
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

824
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:13,753
You don't look a day older, Tom.

825
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,256
Sir Robert.

826
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,716
When will our young lads come back to us?

827
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,845
Will you find my Jamie,
tell him to come home?

828
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,435
With no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.

829
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,853
To be soldiers?

830
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,188
Poachers.

831
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:38,695
Look at that, mate.

832
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,449
Still here then?

833
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:49,330
For the time being, refer to me
as Sir Robert. I'll explain later.

834
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,543
My men-at-arms.
This is about as courtly as they get.

835
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,380
Allan A'Dayle, Will Scarlet and Little John.

836
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,715
Lady Marion.

837
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:08,349
I trust you had an historic evening.

838
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,184
For sure.

839
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,942
Lady Marion Loxley. My wife.

840
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,069
Well played.

841
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,157
A bit rash but well played nonetheless.

842
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,658
Right you are, Robin.

843
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,452
Sir Robert.

844
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,120
- Sir Robert.
- Sir...

845
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,497
- Sir.
- Sir.

846
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,249
- Sir Bob.
- Sir Robert.

847
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:41,632
Friar.

848
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:47,972
Ah, Marion. Good news travels
from Peper Harow this morning.

849
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,351
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

850
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:55,146
You should've made yourself known
when we met in the field. Welcome home.

851
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,524
Yes, I should've. Forgive me, Friar.

852
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:00,777
What happens here?

853
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,738
We're moving
the Church's grain to York.

854
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,573
Politics out of London, I hear.

855
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,618
This is our grain. It belongs in this soil.

856
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,704
Lady Marion, I but follow the orders
of my superiors

857
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,207
and abide by their saying and rule.

858
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,672
Does His Holiness
know about your wealth of honey?

859
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,845
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert.
Voracious wolves.

860
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,973
The bees are my family.

861
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:33,559
I'm a procreator by design.

862
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,021
I'm not a churchy friar. Never was.

863
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,649
My bees give life.

864
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,068
They are my life, Sir Robert.

865
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,070
Should not the Bishop be told

866
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:47,323
so the clergy can spread
Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?

867
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,538
What if the grain were not to reach York?

868
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:58,334
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

869
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,680
I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

870
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:15,143
I was a daughter of a respectable widow
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

871
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:19,313
We were wed, and then a week later

872
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:23,442
he left to join ship
for France and the Holy Lands.

873
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,571
And that was my married life to a man

874
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,283
I hardly knew.

875
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,746
- A good knight.
- Short, but sweet.

876
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,959
I mean, he was a good knight.

877
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,503
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

878
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,922
Oh, yes,
my knight-in-arms, even so.

879
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,757
And I in his.

880
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,082
Stop! You'll break its neck.

881
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,388
Marion.

882
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,607
Easy.

883
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,528
I'm all right.

884
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:56,118
I can't move me legs.

885
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,747
Thank you.

886
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,293
My Lord?

887
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,141
Oh, is it my turn now?

888
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,485
Thank you.

889
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,990
Nicely done, sir.

890
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:38,911
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

891
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:45,084
I don't believe you know my husband,

892
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:46,585
Sir Robert.

893
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,256
Allow me to introduce
the Sheriff of Nottingham.

894
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,091
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

895
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:56,012
You make your mark quickly
by rescuing the King's ram from drowning.

896
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:57,596
What's this?

897
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:01,892
What's mine in coin I have the right
to take in goods or livestock.

898
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,895
If it's God's will.

899
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,985
Here's a ram's worth of tax
for the Exchequer.

900
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,446
Your insolence to Lady Marion,

901
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,531
I'll consider a debt between us.

902
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:43,893
Mead and grain alcohol?

903
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,853
I thought as much.

904
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,692
There's something that we need to do.

905
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,527
At your service.

906
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,124
All right, lads.

907
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:11,545
Should've left while you had the chance.
Something's afoot. Off we go.

908
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,230
Stop. Stop the horses.

909
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,985
You there! Move aside!
We're on Church business!

910
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:37,905
None shall pass

911
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:40,533
unless they can answer the riddle.

912
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:42,827
Moon-mad!

913
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,580
And what is the riddle, you insolent wretch?

914
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:51,919
What has 18 legs and isn't going anywhere?

915
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,258
Your next move will be your last.

916
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,760
Evening, friend.

917
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,931
I demand to know who you are.

918
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:05,808
We are men of the hood.

919
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,104
Merry now, at your expense.

920
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,857
"The Lord taketh..."

921
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,316
And we shall giveth back.

922
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,944
My advice is to plant
it now, by moonlight.

923
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,320
Why is that, good friar?

924
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:21,490
When it sprouts, I can claim
it as a miracle from God.

925
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,618
The Church in York would
never deny a miracle.

926
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,040
How much further?

927
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,542
About 11 miles.

928
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:23,761
I thought you had left.

929
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:26,931
The fields have been planted.

930
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,975
I didn't want to wake you.

931
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,977
How did you find the seed?

932
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,813
If you have to ask, it's not a gift.

933
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,859
Thank you.

934
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,823
Pikemen, at the ready!

935
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,241
Arms to ready!

936
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,326
Prepare!

937
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,621
This King John is no king of mine!

938
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,001
You! Are you Baldwin? Open these gates!

939
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,836
In whose name do you come against us?

940
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,754
In the name of King John.

941
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,924
Pay or burn.

942
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:47,511
We have paid in money
and men for King Richard's wars!

943
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,638
And we have no more to give!

944
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,682
- Burn it.
- Archers!

945
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,120
Come on.

946
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,925
My Lord, this way!

947
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,223
<i>In the name of John,</i>

948
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:36,393
<i>by the Grace of God, King of England,</i>

949
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:41,899
<i>let it be known to all who abide here
that a tax is warranted!</i>

950
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:51,325
<i>Those persons
refusing to abide by the law</i>

951
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:54,620
<i>will hereby be subject
to severe punishment.</i>

952
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:02,503
<i>By order of His Majesty, King John.</i>

953
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,349
Father Tancred!

954
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:34,451
Your Majesty.

955
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,248
Your Majesty.

956
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,753
I have lost the confidence of King John,

957
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,131
but he may still listen to you.

958
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,466
Allow me to know better, William.

959
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,136
You are much wiser than your owl.

960
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,472
I dare say. I've lived longer.

961
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,517
Edward, take him.

962
01:29:58,601 --> 01:29:59,685
Your Majesty.

963
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:06,525
John is no Richard, alas, Your Majesty.

964
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:13,323
But I serve the throne,
and the throne will endure.

965
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:18,996
Speak plainly, Marshal.
What's troubling you?

966
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,748
The crown is in peril.

967
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:26,211
Godfrey has been plotting
with Philip of France.

968
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,256
French troops have already landed
on our shores,

969
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,092
and they are murdering Englishmen
in the name of King John.

970
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:36,930
The northern barons
will make civil war against the throne.

971
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:40,559
Leaving our coast defenseless
against the invasion

972
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,270
which is certainly coming.

973
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:50,736
So it's left to John's mother to scold him
like a child and point him to his duty.

974
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:01,121
My son has an enemy in his court
closer to him than any friend.

975
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,791
An English traitor. A paid agent of France.

976
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,962
Why are you telling me
when you must tell the King?

977
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,464
Isabella!

978
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:13,800
It is you who must do that.

979
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,637
Tell King John that you've
had word from France,

980
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,472
from Philip himself, if you like.

981
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,059
Why not tell him the truth?
That William Marshal...

982
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,396
Oh! A mother he mistrusts
bearing the word of a man in dishonor?

983
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:27,689
No.

984
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:32,986
If you wish to be queen,
you must save John.

985
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,948
And England.

986
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:38,617
No!

987
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,286
No! No!

988
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:47,167
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

989
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,504
By the bowels of Christ, it's a lie.

990
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,422
You lie!

991
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,318
I'm sorry, my love.

992
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,295
- Sheriff.
- Up there.

993
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:38,302
Man won't give his name.
Demands audience with the sheriff.

994
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:40,095
Demands?

995
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,224
Go away.

996
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,392
My Lord.

997
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:10,167
Tax collections proceed apace.

998
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,919
Nottingham's turn is coming.

999
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,213
Good. Good.

1000
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:19,176
Tell Sir Godfrey
that the Sheriff of Nottingham is his man.

1001
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,970
May he put his stamp on my authority.

1002
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:26,850
I see trouble
coming from Loxley of Peper Harow.

1003
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,269
A blind old man gives you trouble?

1004
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,521
Aye, and his son will give more.

1005
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:35,901
The crusader, Robert Loxley,
has returned this past week.

1006
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,690
Marion.

1007
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,505
Go on! Go on.

1008
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,554
Has he spoken yet?

1009
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,930
He was spying, Loop.

1010
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,807
Spying?

1011
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,811
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

1012
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:36,563
Hello, Marion.

1013
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,398
I've come to save you.

1014
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,817
Know him?

1015
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:46,156
Boys, this is Sir Robert Loxley, my husband.

1016
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,701
Sir Robert, the runaways of Sherwood.

1017
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:51,995
Untie him.

1018
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,874
No, I don't think spies should be let off
so easily.

1019
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,834
That was unkind.

1020
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,711
You were a crusader?

1021
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:00,921
Yes.

1022
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,965
Did you hear that, boys?
You bested a crusader.

1023
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:06,343
My men are good fighters.

1024
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,594
I don't know about that.

1025
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:10,096
I think the weight of numbers
might have been in their favor.

1026
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,933
But they do move silently like
the creatures of the forest.

1027
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,101
But that's only a skill
if you stay as a man.

1028
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,270
You don't become the creatures you hunt.

1029
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,438
We're soldiers.

1030
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:19,689
No, you're not.

1031
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:22,901
Soldiers fight for a cause. What's yours?

1032
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:28,114
You don't have one.
That makes you poachers.

1033
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,786
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

1034
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,954
Like what?

1035
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,289
I could teach you how to tie knots.

1036
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:39,292
I could teach you which wood to get
to make your bows stronger.

1037
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:43,588
I could teach you how to make arrows
that fly more than 20 feet.

1038
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,384
And I can help Marion to teach you
how to stay clean

1039
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:49,469
so you won't get sick.

1040
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:53,306
I don't know who you're
fighting, son, but it's not me.

1041
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,558
I'm not your enemy.

1042
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:58,562
If you want to chat,
you know where to find me.

1043
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:13,952
Wife?

1044
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:22,961
Marshal.

1045
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,006
Stand aside! Make way for the King!

1046
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,132
Your Majesty.

1047
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:32,304
What the devil are you doing here? Hmm?

1048
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,513
Sire?

1049
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,099
Will you keep that animal still?
What's it got, palsy?

1050
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,937
Do you think I haven't noticed
how you've deserted me?

1051
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:43,565
If Your Majesty recalls,
our last conversation...

1052
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,025
At our last conversation,

1053
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,403
Philip of France wasn't coming our way
with an invasion fleet.

1054
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:50,822
Was he, Marshal?

1055
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,411
My friend Godfrey

1056
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,873
is not the friend I thought he was.

1057
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,710
He's stirred up the
northern barons against me.

1058
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:06,588
They come south with an army.

1059
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,675
Marshal, how dare they?
How dare they?

1060
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,595
Sire, forgotten men are dangerous men.

1061
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:18,350
<i>The barons need to be told</i>

1062
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:22,354
<i>that when the French come,
we are all Englishmen.</i>

1063
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:24,773
Fitzrobert.

1064
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,107
Baldwin.

1065
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,819
We'll make an army of the north
and march on London.

1066
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:32,113
The barons need leadership.

1067
01:38:33,115 --> 01:38:36,993
Wiser kings know
they must let men look them in the eye,

1068
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,788
hear their voice.

1069
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:43,792
Together, let us ride north to meet them.

1070
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:49,506
They march against their king, Marshal.

1071
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,134
Their king.

1072
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,431
We will meet them with the pikes
of our militia in their gizzards.

1073
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,643
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

1074
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:06,314
Perhaps we'll look to the barons
without you.

1075
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:20,620
Saddle up with a spare horse.
I leave immediately.

1076
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:22,247
I want to know where to find Godfrey.

1077
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:23,665
My Lord.

1078
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,223
I found him, My Lord.

1079
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:41,391
Where?

1080
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:45,729
Nottingham. In plain sight,
living as Walter Loxley's son.

1081
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,695
Then we go to Nottingham.

1082
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:57,198
Take no prisoners.
Leave no stone un-scorched.

1083
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,203
Take two men, four horses.

1084
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:06,541
Ride hard for the coast, then on to Paris
and give a message to the King.

1085
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,853
I'll make the place famous.

1086
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,858
Come, Allan!

1087
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:35,069
I'll get them drinking.
You get them dancing!

1088
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:36,237
All right.

1089
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:12,315
Music, laughter,
the crackle of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

1090
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:16,152
Life has returned.
You have returned it, Robin.

1091
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:18,358
How did you know it was me?

1092
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:22,028
Who else would sit by me uninvited

1093
01:43:22,821 --> 01:43:25,448
like a friend from the old days?

1094
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:27,659
How are you, William?

1095
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,287
I'm well and troubled.

1096
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:33,873
Ah. And what brings you?

1097
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:37,001
I'm riding on to Barnsdale tonight.

1098
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:41,381
I've heard something of the barons' anger
against the crown's tax collector...

1099
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:43,883
The anger has turned into action.

1100
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,135
They assemble to march against the King.

1101
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,805
You think you can persuade the barons
to turn back?

1102
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:49,973
Turn back, no.

1103
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:55,144
To join King John against a French invasion.

1104
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:58,481
- A what?
- Help me, Walter.

1105
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,775
I cannot go with you.

1106
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,444
I cannot speak for this king.

1107
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:05,113
He is the only king we have.

1108
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:06,614
But not the only hope.

1109
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,866
Explain.

1110
01:44:10,452 --> 01:44:11,494
Marion.

1111
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:12,662
I'm here, Walter.

1112
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,248
This is my old friend,
William Marshal.

1113
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,834
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

1114
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,753
Lady, I was glad to see Sir Robert
when he disembarked in London.

1115
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:23,339
I think you know better, Marshal.

1116
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:28,177
Sir William, I know,
would like to meet Robin Longstride again.

1117
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:40,773
We've met before.

1118
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,276
Yes, Sir, I know. In London.

1119
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,530
No, when you were a child.

1120
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:51,034
Hobby-horse age.

1121
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:55,705
Sir Walter and I returned from the Holy Land
to fetch you home.

1122
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:57,457
But you'd gone.

1123
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:00,710
We had lost Thomas Longstride's son.

1124
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:06,799
It was a wound that never healed.

1125
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,726
You need to know what I know.

1126
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,688
Your father was a stonemason.

1127
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,900
Is that pleasing to you?

1128
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,237
Yes. It is.

1129
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,074
But he was more than that.
He was a visionary.

1130
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,577
What did he see?

1131
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,622
That kings have a need of their subjects

1132
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:41,751
no less than their subjects
have need of kings.

1133
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,503
A dangerous idea.

1134
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:47,340
Your father was a philosopher.
He had a way of speaking

1135
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,551
that took you by the ears and by the heart.

1136
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:53,596
None of these things
can be written down, Robin.

1137
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,682
You must commit them to your very soul.

1138
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:59,060
This is the science of memory.

1139
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:05,149
"Rise and rise again
until lambs become lions."

1140
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:12,615
Finally, hundreds listened,
thousands, who took up his call

1141
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:16,160
<i>for the rights of all
ranks from baron to serf.</i>

1142
01:46:19,289 --> 01:46:20,957
"Rise and rise again

1143
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,461
"until lambs become lions."

1144
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:28,881
What happened to him?

1145
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,385
Close your eyes.

1146
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,762
<i>...foundation is set on
the rights of liberty for all people!</i>

1147
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:45,356
Longstride, give up the charter
and their names!

1148
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:53,406
<i>You were there.</i>

1149
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,157
You saw it.

1150
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:56,742
I will not.

1151
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:13,926
Not dead.

1152
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:26,981
Not now.

1153
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:33,863
Not now.

1154
01:47:38,201 --> 01:47:41,913
Here is my copy
of the main contract.

1155
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:45,833
This charter of rights
was written by your father.

1156
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:49,962
And here are... There are the names of
all the barons that signed the charter.

1157
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:53,090
Fitzrobert, Baldwin, Marshal and myself.

1158
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,261
What he wanted was a
charter for every man...

1159
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:58,429
Wait there.

1160
01:47:58,513 --> 01:47:59,889
To have the same rights.

1161
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,474
- Sir Walter?
- Huh?

1162
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:03,100
A messenger for you.

1163
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:04,727
Bring him in.

1164
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:06,687
Step forward, sir.

1165
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:09,482
My Lord.

1166
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,775
I'm listening.

1167
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:12,944
Peterborough's been burned
by the King's men.

1168
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:16,489
Fitzrobert gathers an army
to slay King John in London.

1169
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,742
Marshal requests your presence
at counsel in Barnsdale.

1170
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:23,663
Wait outside, will you?

1171
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,750
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

1172
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,337
The time for pretense is over.

1173
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:35,675
Now, hold me like a son.

1174
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,141
Go.

1175
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:48,437
Maggie. Where's my lady?

1176
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:50,106
I could not find her, sir.

1177
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:20,970
Whether we fight for our lives,
our family and our honor,

1178
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:22,972
we must fight till the death.

1179
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,809
You've spent too long
in the palace, William.

1180
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:30,229
Spending time in the palace
gives me perspective.

1181
01:49:31,356 --> 01:49:32,815
As we speak,

1182
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:36,861
King Philip sails for our coast.

1183
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:42,366
Godfrey and his marauders are French!

1184
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:46,954
Every minute that we waste in disunity

1185
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:50,291
brings closer the
destruction of our country!

1186
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,418
We have been bled

1187
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,838
by the King long before Godfrey.

1188
01:49:56,214 --> 01:49:59,008
Go back to London and tell the King

1189
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:03,471
that we will meet him
on a field of his choice.

1190
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:04,597
Make way!

1191
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:07,308
We will not fight
to save John's crown.

1192
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:10,603
Rather let him bend the knee to us.

1193
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:14,023
I'll give you more,
Sir Baldwin.

1194
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:17,526
My breast for your sword point.

1195
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:20,863
Use mine.

1196
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:26,452
Go on.

1197
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,038
No?

1198
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:33,501
Oh, this is what you want, isn't it?
This is what he wants.

1199
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:37,546
Fine, I'd rather give it to you
than have it taken by the French.

1200
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:40,800
You mistake me, Sire.

1201
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:44,595
I have no right and no ambition
to wear the crown.

1202
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,973
But let the rightful wearer beware.

1203
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:52,478
From now we will be subject only
to laws that we have a hand in making.

1204
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:57,316
We are not sheep
to be made mutton of by your butchers.

1205
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:02,780
Godfrey set himself to turn you against me.

1206
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:06,033
Then he did more than was needed
to accomplish that.

1207
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,748
A very important decision.

1208
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:17,002
Don't you think that we've paid
too much taxes for far too long...

1209
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:26,697
This is where I was born.

1210
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:42,963
What does it mean?

1211
01:52:43,048 --> 01:52:44,548
It means never give up.

1212
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:50,512
We will not be loyal to a crown
that robs and starves us!

1213
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,099
The King must listen to what we have to say!

1214
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:58,979
A king does not bargain for the loyalty
that every subject owes him.

1215
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:03,776
Without loyalty there is no kingdom.
There is nothing.

1216
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,279
I'm here to speak for Sir Walter Loxley.

1217
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,659
- Let the man speak.
- Let him speak!

1218
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,119
Speak! Speak!

1219
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:16,956
Speak, if you must.

1220
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:21,377
If you're trying to build for the future,

1221
01:53:22,045 --> 01:53:24,588
you must set your foundation strong.

1222
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:30,886
The laws of this land
enslave people to its king,

1223
01:53:32,555 --> 01:53:36,809
a king who demands loyalty
but offers nothing in return.

1224
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:41,230
I have marched from France

1225
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:43,857
to Palestine and back.

1226
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:46,235
And I know

1227
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:49,989
in tyranny lies only failure.

1228
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:54,118
You build a country
like you build a cathedral,

1229
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:55,494
from the ground up.

1230
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:58,872
Empower every man

1231
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:01,292
and you will gain strength.

1232
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:03,168
Hmm.

1233
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:06,797
Well, who could object
to such reasonable words?

1234
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:12,928
If Your Majesty were to offer justice,

1235
01:54:14,139 --> 01:54:16,473
justice in the form of
a charter of liberties,

1236
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,936
allowing every man to forage for his hearth,

1237
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:25,190
to be safe from conviction without cause

1238
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,276
or prison without charge,

1239
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:32,072
to work, eat and live
on the sweat of his own brow

1240
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,825
and be as merry as he can...

1241
01:54:34,909 --> 01:54:36,577
Sir, Godfrey's men are on to Nottingham.

1242
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:39,747
...then that king would be great.

1243
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:44,084
Not only would he receive
the loyalty of his people

1244
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:46,879
but their love, as well.

1245
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:51,133
So what would you have? Hmm?

1246
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:52,968
Castle for every man?

1247
01:54:55,305 --> 01:54:57,473
Every Englishman's home is his castle.

1248
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,643
What we would ask, Your Majesty,

1249
01:55:03,104 --> 01:55:04,563
is liberty.

1250
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:07,024
Liberty by law!

1251
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:11,320
Your Majesty, My Lords,

1252
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,698
the French fleet is in the Channel.

1253
01:55:14,783 --> 01:55:19,787
Sire, you have a chance
to unify your subjects high and low.

1254
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:23,207
It falls on your nod.

1255
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:25,918
I only have to nod?

1256
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:31,590
I can do better than that.

1257
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:35,844
I give my word

1258
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:39,598
that such a charter will be written.

1259
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:43,018
On my mother's life, I swear it.

1260
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:51,527
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.
I must stay with the King.

1261
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:53,654
I will send Baldwin and Fitzrobert with you.

1262
01:55:53,738 --> 01:55:57,533
We will meet again at the White Horse
when you are finished.

1263
01:55:57,617 --> 01:56:00,661
Robin, your father was a great man.

1264
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,206
And you are your father's son.

1265
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:16,718
Maggie, who's at the house?

1266
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:19,596
Long live the King!

1267
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,842
Gentlemen.

1268
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:13,775
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1269
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:20,616
I'm French on my mother's side.

1270
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:44,848
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

1271
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,316
Loxley!

1272
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:56,235
Show yourself!

1273
01:57:58,363 --> 01:57:59,655
Loxley!

1274
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:03,867
Who calls here?

1275
01:58:04,535 --> 01:58:06,495
I call for Robert Loxley.

1276
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:08,705
My son is not here to answer you.

1277
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:10,123
That is the truth.

1278
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,084
Because he's dead in a French ditch.

1279
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:15,879
And who are you, sir, to say so?

1280
01:58:17,715 --> 01:58:19,258
Who am I?

1281
01:58:27,725 --> 01:58:28,892
I'm the one who killed him.

1282
01:58:31,521 --> 01:58:33,021
Fight me if you dare.

1283
01:58:34,148 --> 01:58:35,565
Lord have mercy.

1284
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:26,074
Leave it on the table. Leave it! Next!

1285
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,702
Next! Come on!

1286
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:32,205
- Name?
- Loxley.

1287
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:34,249
Christian name?

1288
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,917
Marion.

1289
01:59:36,753 --> 01:59:38,462
Land?

1290
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:40,422
5,000 acres.

1291
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:43,175
Lady Marion Loxley?

1292
01:59:43,885 --> 01:59:45,469
I am.

1293
02:00:14,665 --> 02:00:17,751
Gentlemen, enjoy!

1294
02:00:51,202 --> 02:00:53,120
No one should have 4,000 acres.

1295
02:00:53,204 --> 02:00:55,205
5,000 acres.

1296
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:35,597
Baldwin! Fitzrobert!

1297
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:38,183
Take the southern flank
and circle in from the west.

1298
02:02:38,809 --> 02:02:41,394
Will and Allan,
get on the rooftops and pick your targets.

1299
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,167
Lady Marion.

1300
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:27,023
Quickly.

1301
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:54,551
Follow me.

1302
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:20,744
Somebody, please take the baby!
Save the baby, please!

1303
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:31,755
John, down!

1304
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:39,179
It's all right.

1305
02:04:39,263 --> 02:04:40,430
Go around.

1306
02:04:40,514 --> 02:04:41,765
Stand back!

1307
02:04:43,601 --> 02:04:44,642
Make way!

1308
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:49,898
Hurry. It's all right. It's all right.
Please, hurry! Hurry!

1309
02:05:01,577 --> 02:05:02,702
Sword!

1310
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:24,557
Get down,
you bastard French dogs!

1311
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:18,069
Where will King Philip land
and when?

1312
02:06:31,917 --> 02:06:33,877
This is my last arrow.

1313
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:39,424
Dungeness! Dungeness. Two days.

1314
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:45,972
There we have it. We have two days.

1315
02:08:12,601 --> 02:08:15,186
Once before I said goodbye
to a man going to war.

1316
02:08:16,146 --> 02:08:17,480
He never came back.

1317
02:08:23,862 --> 02:08:25,238
Ask me nicely.

1318
02:09:00,274 --> 02:09:01,566
I love you, Marion.

1319
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,628
Longstride!

1320
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:00,745
What news of Walter and Nottingham?

1321
02:12:01,997 --> 02:12:04,582
Sir Walter is dead. Godfrey's hand.

1322
02:12:04,666 --> 02:12:07,418
Gentlemen, we go to war.

1323
02:12:07,628 --> 02:12:10,338
It is my first time. I shall lead.

1324
02:12:10,422 --> 02:12:12,465
Forward!

1325
02:13:52,566 --> 02:13:54,191
That's a lot of French.

1326
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:58,195
What's to be done?

1327
02:13:59,573 --> 02:14:00,698
Archers to the cliff top.

1328
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:04,368
Cavalry to the beach.
We'll await you there.

1329
02:14:04,745 --> 02:14:05,786
With me!

1330
02:14:05,871 --> 02:14:07,038
Archers!

1331
02:14:09,374 --> 02:14:11,167
Excellent plan.

1332
02:14:32,856 --> 02:14:34,065
Cavalry!

1333
02:14:46,286 --> 02:14:47,745
Ready!

1334
02:15:07,349 --> 02:15:08,808
Raise arrows!

1335
02:15:08,892 --> 02:15:10,184
Raise arrows!

1336
02:15:11,144 --> 02:15:12,228
Ready!

1337
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:17,817
Raise arrows!

1338
02:15:18,235 --> 02:15:20,111
Release! Release!

1339
02:15:32,624 --> 02:15:33,708
Release!

1340
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:12,079
For the love of God, Marion!

1341
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:17,793
Loxley,

1342
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:21,047
circle your troops and then join the charge.

1343
02:16:26,178 --> 02:16:27,303
With me!

1344
02:16:32,184 --> 02:16:33,309
Release!

1345
02:16:44,529 --> 02:16:45,571
Release!

1346
02:17:33,161 --> 02:17:35,371
Forward!

1347
02:17:53,348 --> 02:17:54,932
Archers, forward!

1348
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:23,794
Let's go, Marshal.

1349
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:25,004
We're close enough, Sire.

1350
02:18:26,047 --> 02:18:27,882
This was not
close enough for Richard.

1351
02:18:27,966 --> 02:18:29,800
And look what happened to him.

1352
02:18:30,844 --> 02:18:31,886
Forward!

1353
02:18:32,929 --> 02:18:34,305
Protect the King!

1354
02:19:05,587 --> 02:19:07,379
This is for you, Walter.

1355
02:19:20,477 --> 02:19:23,479
No!

1356
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:32,029
Marion!

1357
02:21:15,425 --> 02:21:16,884
Marion!

1358
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:45,954
Surrender!

1359
02:22:08,561 --> 02:22:10,521
Sire! Sire!

1360
02:22:10,855 --> 02:22:12,940
They've surrendered, Sire!

1361
02:22:13,274 --> 02:22:15,442
Yes! To whom?

1362
02:22:19,322 --> 02:22:20,489
To him.

1363
02:22:20,573 --> 02:22:22,449
Longstride!

1364
02:22:24,119 --> 02:22:39,132
Longstride!

1365
02:23:17,005 --> 02:23:19,339
Longstride!

1366
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:23,260
Longstride!

1367
02:23:24,345 --> 02:23:26,346
I did not make myself king.

1368
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:27,556
God did.

1369
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:30,893
King by divine right.

1370
02:23:36,274 --> 02:23:38,775
Now you come to me with this document

1371
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,027
seeking to limit the authority
given to me by God!

1372
02:23:40,111 --> 02:23:42,112
Sire, you gave your word!

1373
02:23:42,196 --> 02:23:44,114
No.

1374
02:23:44,198 --> 02:23:45,198
- Sire, you give us our word, Sire!
- Did I command you to speak, sir?

1375
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:46,533
- John...
- Or you, madam?

1376
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:48,368
Sire, we looked to you!

1377
02:23:48,786 --> 02:23:51,705
Look to your estates, instead.

1378
02:23:55,043 --> 02:23:56,335
Archers!

1379
02:23:57,045 --> 02:24:00,213
You are fortunate that
I am in a merciful mood.

1380
02:24:01,382 --> 02:24:05,761
But as for Robin
Longstride, that mason's son,

1381
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:11,266
for the crimes of theft and
incitement to cause unrest,

1382
02:24:11,351 --> 02:24:15,228
who pretended to be a knight of the
realm, a crime punishable by death,

1383
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:20,651
I declare him, from this
day forth, to be an outlaw!

1384
02:24:22,570 --> 02:24:26,198
To be hunted all the days of his life...

1385
02:24:26,282 --> 02:24:28,116
We will not stand for this!

1386
02:24:28,201 --> 02:24:30,327
...until his corpse,
unburied, is carrion

1387
02:24:30,411 --> 02:24:33,121
for foxes and crows!

1388
02:24:56,187 --> 02:24:57,980
Hear me! Hear me!

1389
02:25:01,109 --> 02:25:02,818
By royal decree,

1390
02:25:03,403 --> 02:25:06,738
Robin Longstride,
also known as Robin of the Hood,

1391
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:10,283
and all who shelter him or aid him

1392
02:25:10,368 --> 02:25:12,035
are declared outlaws of the realm,

1393
02:25:13,287 --> 02:25:14,871
Their properties forfeit,

1394
02:25:14,956 --> 02:25:19,126
and their lives shall be taken
by any Englishman on sight.

1395
02:25:25,091 --> 02:25:27,801
A nail please? And a hammer.

1396
02:25:28,511 --> 02:25:29,594
A nail!

1397
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,023
Off you go. Come on.

1398
02:26:23,941 --> 02:26:25,108
Hey, boys.

1399
02:26:25,193 --> 02:26:27,110
- You've been practicing tying your knots?
- Yes.

1400
02:26:27,195 --> 02:26:29,029
Have you been shooting
your bow and arrows?

1401
02:26:29,113 --> 02:26:30,697
Who hit something? Anyone?

1402
02:26:30,782 --> 02:26:33,617
<i>The greenwood
is the outlaw's friend.</i>

1403
02:26:33,701 --> 02:26:36,453
<i>Now, the orphan boys make us welcome.</i>

1404
02:26:37,371 --> 02:26:38,747
<i>No tax, no tithe.</i>

1405
02:26:38,831 --> 02:26:43,251
<i>Nobody rich, nobody poor.
Fair shares for all at nature's table.</i>

1406
02:26:43,544 --> 02:26:47,714
<i>Many wrongs to be righted
in the country of King John.</i>

1407
02:26:51,052 --> 02:26:53,220
<i>Watch over us, Walter.</i>

1408
02:29:52,692 --> 02:29:54,192
For the Lion Heart!
