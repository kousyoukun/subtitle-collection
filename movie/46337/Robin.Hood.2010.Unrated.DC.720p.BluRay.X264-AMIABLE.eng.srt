1
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,814
Can somebody tell me what's going on?

2
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,690
Don't be foolish, Walter. Get him back to bed.

3
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,400
- Bar the door.
- I'm still the master of this house.

4
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,902
Richard, up.

5
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,073
Who is there?

6
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,741
Wake up, Thomas.

7
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,915
Open the gates!

8
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,926
Bastards.

9
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,928
Arrow.

10
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,433
The lantern.

11
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,946
I see you, you little bastards.

12
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,781
I see you!

13
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,296
Thieving maggots.

14
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,173
They've taken all our seed grain.

15
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,552
What are we going to do for planting?

16
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,470
Pray.

17
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,745
Hello, there!

18
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,884
- Here you go, lad.
- Thank you, Robin.

19
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,386
Robin.

20
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,762
The archers been called to ranks.

21
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,889
Bloody typical. I'm starving.

22
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,849
Hide these well.

23
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,102
We'll have them for supper instead.

24
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
Sire.

25
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,123
Your bath, Sire.

26
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,042
For the love of Christ, Loxley,

27
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,646
would you stop them doing that!

28
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,273
They love you, Sire.

29
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,942
My head. It's going like the bells of hell.

30
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,988
Is that it?

31
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,451
One more castle to sack, then we're home to England.

32
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,871
Hail King Richard!

33
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,335
Release!

34
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,673
Push!

35
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,259
Hey, archer!

36
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,886
Stay alive!

37
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,179
I'll see you tonight.

38
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,306
Don't forget your money this time, little man.

39
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,558
It will be my pleasure to take it off you.

40
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,394
Push!

41
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,317
Move up!

42
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,949
Cover the King! Cover the King!

43
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,955
Barricades prepare!

44
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,799
Let us put these French to bed!

45
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,306
Raise the barricades!

46
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,487
Jimmy.

47
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,822
Calm and careful. Make it count.

48
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,157
Go!

49
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,014
Help!

50
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,559
Cover!

51
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,780
Now.

52
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,243
Go!

53
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,878
Move back!

54
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,048
Blood for France!

55
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,884
Go!

56
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,221
It'll make a fine pin cushion!

57
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,348
King Philip's arse!

58
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:56,243
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

59
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,247
Push!

60
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,665
Push!

61
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,336
That'll burn all night, lads.  Don't let them put it out.

62
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,176
These pricks will smash through in the morning,

63
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:08,881
take all the credit.

64
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,507
Well done, Jimmy boy.

65
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,821
John...

66
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,365
Your Majesty.

67
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,035
An English Princess shut out of her husband's bedchamber

68
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,245
by a piece of French pastry!

69
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,872
Aren't you ashamed?

70
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,791
The shame is surely his.

71
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,876
Then go in and tell him.

72
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,588
Mewling at his keyhole is neither one thing nor the other.

73
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,799
John.

74
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,972
Oh, God! What in heaven...

75
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,266
Mademoiselle, you will excuse me.

76
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,394
My son has need of my advice.

77
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,270
No, I don't. Ask her.

78
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,066
Mother, please, have you no decency?

79
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,513
I happen to be in a condition

80
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,737
that no mother should see her son in.

81
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,284
- Yes, I know, but it's my mother.

82
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,411
- That's enough.

83
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,912
On second thoughts,

84
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,207
 I think it better that  you do hear what I have to say.

85
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,127
Though I will not have you in my presence.

86
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,837
Mother.

87
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,799
The purpose of my being in this room is to save the realm

88
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,970
from the consequences of this unsuitable amusement.

89
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,764
Her uncle is the bloody King of France.

90
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,892
- My uncle is...
- Get down.

91
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,645
Her uncle wants her back.

92
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,399
Philip wants an excuse

93
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,570
to cross the channel with an army.

94
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,239
And you have given him that excuse.

95
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,160
Take up your lawful wife and save England.

96
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,913
My lawful wife is as barren as a brick.

97
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,958
Is that truly the wife you want for me?

98
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,921
You, who honoured your husband with eight children

99
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,549
so that even now when death has taken the rest

100
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,596
You have a King and the runt of the litter to call you "mother".

101
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,348
Better the bastard of a servant girl

102
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,976
than bed the niece of England's jealous enemy.

103
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,645
Or bed her and wed her, mother.

104
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,356
I've asked the Pope's men to arrange an annulment.

105
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,192
And do you think the Pope

106
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,862
will favour England's royal runt over the King of France?

107
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,073
He might see his way for the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

108
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,534
And for the future King of England.

109
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,413
Richard the Lion Heart is 40-years-old, if not more.

110
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
And no babies.

111
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,503
I am a queen in the maKing.

112
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,507
Yes. Yes.

113
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,426
You see?

114
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,930
She is my Eleanor.

115
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,561
Now, you do understand, this game is not about luck.

116
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,564
It's about the science of memory and a quick hand.

117
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,358
Who'd like to take a bit of fresh meat home?

118
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,527
Caught this morning. We have a pheasant.

119
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,112
Three choices. Right, left or middle?

120
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,280
Middle.

121
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,783
"The middle," he says. The middle.

122
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,870
I'm sorry about those onions, young man. You lose.

123
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,539
Robin! Over here, they're needed for the pot.

124
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,040
Feisty one!

125
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,669
Aye, what else we got, what else we got?

126
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,379
The fire will do its work.

127
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,048
We break through at first light.

128
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,802
With a fair wind, we can be home in three days.

129
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,304
You return to Nottingham?

130
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,183
I have a wife who waits for me.

131
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,145
I have a mother that won't die

132
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,898
and a brother who wishes me dead.

133
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,568
First thing I'm going to do is lock them up.

134
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,362
Your people will rejoice to see you return home.

135
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,031
And that is a condition I would like to keep them in.

136
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,158
To be remembered as I was.

137
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,328
My army knows better.

138
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,417
Lion Heart is mangy.

139
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,130
Every man in that army idolises you, your Majesty.

140
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,007
Don't mollycoddle me.

141
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,678
I understand how difficult it must be to be friend a King.

142
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,308
Come on, Loxley. Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.

143
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,894
Let us see if we can find an honest man.

144
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,104
Yes.

145
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,189
Let's do that.

146
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,120
Well, that's the thing, little man. This is not a game of luck.

147
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,582
It's about the science of memory and a quick hand.

148
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,544
I've got a quick eye. I'll be watching you.

149
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,642
Three choices.

150
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,061
Right, left, or middle.

151
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,981
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

152
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,942
A fourth?

153
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,112
I've been watching you for a while now, Longstride.

154
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,531
There is no pea.

155
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,951
This game is a trick!

156
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,276
You take out the pea

157
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:34,164
when you're doing your slidings and your turnings.

158
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,582
I got you.

159
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,547
Don't touch it again.

160
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,800
I'll do it!

161
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,114
You lose.

162
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,718
You're doing better than you think.

163
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,553
Get in there, Robin.

164
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,732
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

165
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,650
Kneel before the King!

166
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,863
All of you, move back, now.

167
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,033
No, no, Loxley. These men are soldiers at play.

168
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,327
Sinners after mine own heart.

169
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,664
Which one of you started the fight?

170
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,334
I did, Sire.

171
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,045
I threw the first punch.

172
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,214
Ah, honest man.

173
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,508
And who're you fighting?

174
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,596
He was fighting me, your Majesty.

175
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,848
I thought him to be a lesser man.

176
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,350
He was showing me different.

177
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,396
An enemy that shows his respect.

178
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,274
Stand up, the pair of you.

179
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,609
Not you.

180
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,200
Brave and honest.

181
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,872
Are you honest enough to tell a King

182
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,331
something that he does not want to hear?

183
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,209
What is your opinion on my crusade?

184
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,839
Will god be pleased with my sacrifice?

185
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,767
No, he won't.

186
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,354
Why do you say that?

187
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,273
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

188
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,567
Speak up!

189
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,040
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim

190
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,990
men, women, and children together,

191
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,315
the young woman at my feet, with her hands bound,

192
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:18,370
she looked up at me.

193
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,415
There wasn't fear in her eyes. There wasn't anger.

194
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,126
There was only pity.

195
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,507
For she knew that when you gave the order

196
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,594
and our blades would descend upon their heads,

197
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,806
that, in that moment, we would be godless.

198
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,933
All of us.

199
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,562
Godless.

200
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,401
Honest,

201
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,778
brave

202
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,743
There is your Englishman.

203
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,204
Right there.

204
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,959
- Well done, Robin.
- You showed him.

205
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,961
The whipping will be the worst of it.

206
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,379
The branding iron, that will be the worst.

207
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,672
Unless they hang us.

208
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,300
No. No, this will be the worst of it.

209
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,552
And this will be the end of it.

210
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,721
As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.

211
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,017
I don't owe God or any other man here one more minute of service.

212
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,872
We go all the way back to the same breast.

213
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,376
Wet nurse.

214
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,669
Indeed.

215
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,588
We've been close ever since.

216
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,883
Good.

217
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,514
Because England, under your friend John,

218
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,601
is a country with no fighting spirit.

219
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,063
I can take London with an army of cooks.

220
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,191
But Richard is on his way home.

221
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,071
And under Richard,  England is a different animal altogether.

222
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,200
Richard will return home through the forest of Broceliande.

223
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,286
We know the exact place.

224
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,866
He always travels ahead of his army

225
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,751
with only a few trusted knights around him.

226
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,546
With Richard dead,

227
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,257
it will be easy for you to turn the country against John.

228
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,427
There'll never be a better moment to invade.

229
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,475
Even dying animals can be obstinate.

230
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,481
Kill the Lion Heart and you will be richly rewarded.

231
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,876
Heave!

232
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,879
Heave!

233
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,605
Heave!

234
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,232
For England!

235
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,363
For England!

236
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,750
I need a physician here!

237
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,794
A physician! Quickly!

238
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,587
Give us cover! Give us cover, now!

239
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,008
Cover him!

240
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,511
Cover the King.

241
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,514
Physician!

242
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,141
Why, Loxley? Are you not feeling well?

243
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,310
Physician!

244
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,818
Wine.

245
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,300
What's this?

246
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,637
- The King is dead!
- Dead?

247
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,556
Dead.

248
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,308
All right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.

249
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,561
We make our own fate from now on!

250
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,482
I'll come with you.

251
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,485
No, you're not. We don't take strays.

252
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,570
The more the merrier.

253
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,572
The road will be dangerous. He might be useful.

254
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,656
Where we going?

255
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,526
To the coast and to a boat

256
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,368
before 3,000 desperate soldiers get there

257
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,829
and the price for a channel crossing goes up a hundredfold.

258
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,289
What about our wages?

259
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,417
If you thought it was hard getting wages while he was alive,

260
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,335
try getting paid by a dead King.

261
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,672
All right, boys, collect your gear as quick as you can.

262
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,263
I like the new church.

263
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,684
Lady Marion.

264
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,395
I would have been sorry

265
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,106
to leave without your farewell. Thank you.

266
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,568
I'm glad to speed you on your way, Father Tancred,

267
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,030
but it was to seek out our new shepherd.

268
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,576
You have lately been missed at Sunday worship and my sermons.

269
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,289
I like a quiet church, Father, when I pray for a miracle.

270
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,634
Your new flock is women, children and old folk.

271
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,886
Our men have gone to war or returned broken.

272
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,056
Their orphans run wild in the greenwood.

273
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,896
Our fields are ready for planting but we've no seed corn.

274
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,066
And the church barn is full of grain.

275
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,777
Surely, you do not expect the church

276
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,780
to let its corn be used to plant your fields?

277
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,658
That grain is bound for York.

278
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,494
I am Friar Tuck.

279
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,038
Father Tancred is elevated to York

280
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,615
where I know he will remind the bishop

281
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:19,874
that the people of Nottingham...

282
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,753
The bishop does not need reminding that the people of Nottingham

283
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,882
should reap what they sow and repent of their sins.

284
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,147
The miracle I pray for is that

285
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:32,178
the bishop show some christian charity.

286
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,352
As I said, Father, I like a quiet church when I pray.

287
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,539
You will have trouble from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

288
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,712
You keep bees, Tuck?

289
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,006
I keep them and they keep me.

290
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,532
Stop!

291
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,160
Ambush!

292
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,072
You're a knight?

293
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,866
Where is King Richard?

294
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,785
Oh, God.

295
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,328
Where is the King?

296
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,039
- Dead.
- Dead?

297
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,500
Really?

298
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,839
If the King's dead, where are you going?

299
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,508
Deliver the crown.

300
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,680
Richard's crown.

301
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,644
Richard's crown.

302
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,239
How do we assassinate a King who's already dead?

303
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,494
Bring back the crown! Kill the horse!

304
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,205
You are English.

305
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,167
When it suits me.

306
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,670
Who are you?

307
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,522
Robert Loxley.

308
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,401
That's the King's horse.

309
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,408
Jimmy! Move!

310
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,920
Jimmy!

311
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,643
Robin, they're French.

312
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,894
Ambush.

313
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,580
Go.

314
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,577
John.

315
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,080
Don't know.

316
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,581
He's dead.

317
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,874
Help.

318
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,884
My sword.

319
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,188
Its value to me is great.

320
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,442
It belonged to my father,

321
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,861
Sir Walter Loxley

322
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,613
of Nottingham.

323
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,908
Do you know it?

324
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,786
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

325
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,875
Then the fate...

326
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,085
The fates have smiled on me.

327
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,843
You must take the sword to my father.

328
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,971
It will bring me peace.

329
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,936
I took it in anger and without his consent.

330
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,483
You must understand the bond of love

331
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,777
between a father and his son.

332
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,327
My father abandoned me to the world of men

333
00:31:05,328 --> 00:31:07,239
when I was six years old.

334
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,950
I know little of the love between father and son.

335
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,535
I beg you.

336
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,871
Longstride,

337
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,414
say you will.

338
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,837
I will.

339
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,735
It's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.

340
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,572
It's a scratch, Allan, and that's all it is.

341
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,052
Robin!

342
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,271
Loxley was making for the coast to meet the ship.

343
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,901
That crown could be our passage home.

344
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,820
We're common archers, Robin.

345
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,731
If we arrive at the King's ship with his crown,

346
00:32:29,732 --> 00:32:30,781
we'll be accused of murder.

347
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,033
How do you know

348
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,159
that the knights you see walking

349
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,329
about are actually knights at all?

350
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,874
There is no difference between a knight

351
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,043
and any other man aside from what he wears.

352
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,130
All we need is about us.

353
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,967
Armour, helmets, swords,

354
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,431
and we make England wealthy men

355
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,268
with horses and gold.

356
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,397
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

357
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,067
And I, for one, shall not turn my back on her.

358
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,780
Take that crown off your head, Will,

359
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,948
And fill it to the brim.

360
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,372
We commit the soul of this boy to your keeping, Lord.

361
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,043
We would ask, when he arrives at the gates of eternity,

362
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,711
if you could let him in.

363
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,729
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely. But for what?

364
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,356
- Nettles?

365
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,982
- Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

366
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,150
that'll keep us alive.

367
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,318
Come, Goliath. this way.

368
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,028
Until we get a miracle.

369
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,072
This way.

370
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,789
Marion, Sheriff.

371
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,259
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow, waiting in vain

372
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,803
for Sir Walter to receive me.

373
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,316
Kindly tell him I have better things to do

374
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:20,724
than haunt his threshold.

375
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,519
That you have, while robbers are roaming free in Sherwood.

376
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,854
That's Sheriff's business. Why don't you look to it?

377
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,148
Tell the old fool that next time, I'll break his door down.

378
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,858
And if he's too proud to pay...

379
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,944
No, no, no, no. He's not too proud.

380
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,529
He's too poor.

381
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,990
In the name of King Richard, you have stripped our wealth

382
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,449
to pay for foreign adventures.

383
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,244
Whilst at home, the church, in the name of the merciful god,

384
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,453
has reaped, without mercy,

385
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,790
the largest share of what we had set aside to feed ourselves.

386
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,377
Between a Sheriff and a Bishop, I wouldn't care to judge

387
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,671
who's the greater curse on honest English folk.

388
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,049
Marion,

389
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,136
Why,why do you make an enemy of me

390
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,388
when you have the means to make me your protector?

391
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,140
What means?

392
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,730
If you leave now,

393
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,316
I will lengthen your life by not telling my husband

394
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,943
of your visit when he returns home.

395
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,946
Your husband? After 10 years?

396
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,523
If he's not dead,

397
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:21,493
He's rutting his way through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

398
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,038
So speaks a man of experience.

399
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,956
Well, think on it, Marion.

400
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,917
Sir Walter is dying without an heir.

401
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,875
Peper Harow will fall to the crown,

402
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:32,963
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

403
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,007
You'll be glad to come to me then.

404
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,876
Captain, there.

405
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,941
Sir, we were told to expect 12 riders and the King.

406
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,944
Our beloved King is dead.

407
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,157
Long live the King.

408
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,784
And you are, Sir?

409
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:49,915
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham. And you?

410
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,501
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

411
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,202
Come aboard, gentlemen, before

412
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:55,963
the tide floats her. It's coming in fast.

413
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,937
And it's row, me bully boys we're in a hurry, boys.

414
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,232
We got a long way to go

415
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:19,236
where we'll sing and we'll dance and bid farewell to France.

416
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,282
And row, me bully boys, row.

417
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:28,328
And it's row, me bully boys we're in a hurry boys.

418
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,832
We got a long way to go.

419
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,461
We'll sing and we'll dance and bid farewell to France.

420
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:39,423
And row, me bully boys, row.

421
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,055
So what's the plan in the morning?

422
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,310
The boat stops at Gravesend on the way to London.

423
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,246
We'll leave the honour of returning the crown to them,

424
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:54,855
and we'll be gone.

425
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,440
Where?

426
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,484
North.

427
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,070
Well, that suits me.

428
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,908
Row, me bully boys, row.

429
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,827
But now we're returning so lock up your daughters.

430
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:32,726
We'll sing and we'll dance and bid farewell to France.

431
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,813
And it's row, me bully boys, row.

432
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,192
Make ready, Sir Robert. We dock in 20 minutes.

433
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,860
Gravesend?

434
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,406
No, my Lord. The palace docks, Tower of London.

435
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,833
Will.

436
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,669
John. Allan.

437
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,548
- Where are we?
- London.

438
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,174
Holy Christ!

439
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,636
We dock in 10 minutes.

440
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,264
When this is done, be ready to ride.

441
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,266
What if... what if Loxley is known

442
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,435
to the King's mother or brother or any of them?

443
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,520
Then we'll be riding for our lives.

444
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:02,024
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

445
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,609
I knew it! I knew it!

446
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,695
Good morning, my Lord.

447
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,282
Some words of advice on this tragic occasion.

448
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,619
You appreciate everything must be done correctly,

449
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,747
So you will present the crown to Lady Eleanor.

450
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,373
You will go down on the right knee.

451
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,336
Do not look in her eyes when you tell her the King is no more.

452
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,214
And do not rise until all others rise. Do you understand?

453
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,382
Yes.

454
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,312
Agnes.

455
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,106
My blue and gold brocade.

456
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,316
Yes, my Lady.

457
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,964
Part for the Queen.

458
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,424
Part for the Queen.

459
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,575
Cease.

460
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,932
What's this? What's happening?

461
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,226
King Richard returns from France, my lord.

462
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,858
Did Loxley deceive us?

463
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,144
Kneel.

464
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,402
Long life, my son.

465
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,280
Rise now.

466
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,952
A King is dead.

467
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,498
Long live the King.

468
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,126
Long live the King!

469
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,923
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

470
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,758
Rise.

471
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,097
You...

472
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,392
I don't know you.

473
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,687
Robert Loxley, Sire, of Nottingham.

474
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,190
Welcome then.

475
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,943
And how did my brother die?

476
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,696
In battle, your Majesty, as was his way.

477
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,407
As was his way.

478
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,368
You deserve a reward...

479
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
Let's get the horses.

480
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,079
...for bringing home the news.

481
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,457
Kneel.

482
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,341
Did you say you were from Nottingham?

483
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:58,885
Yes.

484
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,682
Your father, Sir Walter,

485
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,018
Owes tax to the crown.

486
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,314
My crown.

487
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,984
Tell him it's bloody expensive running a country

488
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,152
and everyone's got to pay their way.

489
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,946
We'll start with this.

490
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,658
Make way for the King!

491
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,660
Make way!

492
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:24,911
Your Majesty.

493
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,872
Make way for the King!

494
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,087
- Make way!
- Godfrey.

495
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,674
Godfrey, my friend. It's so good to see you.

496
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,176
- How were your travels?
- Good, Sire.

497
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,512
What happened to your face?

498
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,473
A hunting accident. It's nothing.

499
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,602
- Frightening.
- Your Majesty.

500
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,188
Call it a duelling scar.

501
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,191
I bow to your knowledge of the ladies, Sire.

502
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,323
You can get up now.

503
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,207
Sir Robert.

504
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,881
You will know of me, perhaps.

505
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,507
I'm William Marshal.

506
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,219
Your father and I were young men together.

507
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,347
Tell him I'm coming to visit him soon,

508
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,515
on Spring's first black night.

509
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,394
I may have need of him.

510
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,730
I will. I'll tell him.

511
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,903
Whoever he is and whatever he is,

512
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,407
Get rid of him.

513
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,464
Come on, let's follow.

514
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,320
Forfeit what you got.

515
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,490
Victuals, coin, clothing

516
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,034
...or your life.

517
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,496
Thomas Cooper.

518
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,665
Is that you?

519
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,755
Are you sick, Thomas?

520
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,132
We're all sick.

521
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,094
- Where are the rest of you?
- Don't... don't tell her.

522
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,596
Loop will be angry.

523
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,514
No, it's your mother who's going to be angry.

524
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,643
Now, either you come with me, or I come with you.

525
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,062
You choose.

526
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,815
Well, come on then. Where are they?

527
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,401
Answer me.

528
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,869
Four men, five horses, one grey.

529
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,663
- Have you seen them?

530
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,831
- That way.

531
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:48,216
The living King of sermons

532
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,885
was delivered from his evil

533
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,848
but he couldn't talk his last

534
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,225
because God took out his throat.

535
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,938
God's crossbow took out his throat.

536
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,441
By Christ! Can you not sing a happy tune?

537
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:11,489
Sing a foot-stomper about adventure and daring and courage.

538
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:15,076
No. Sing something about a woman.

539
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,745
A large woman.

540
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,499
Fancy army, darling I loves you all to bits.

541
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,836
I'll climb up to your chamber and under your mountainous...

542
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,505
Right. I'm done. The money's divided.

543
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,841
And so should we be.

544
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,384
Where will you go?

545
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,265
I think something is owed for this good fortune,

546
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,850
...and I mean to pay it back.

547
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,143
How so?

548
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,772
The inscription on the sword, it taunts my memory.

549
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,568
Maybe it's just my imagination, I don't know.

550
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:52,113
But I intend to take that sword back to its owner

551
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,948
...and fulfil the request of his dying son.

552
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,200
Are you mad?

553
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,785
You just said we were in danger, Robin.

554
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,830
Now you choose to step back in to harm's way?

555
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,833
They're bound to go there and find you.

556
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:08,004
We can't repay our good luck with bad grace. It invites darkness.

557
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,719
- I'm going with you.
- And I, Robin.

558
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,387
- Yes.
- No.

559
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,766
Tonight is our last in company.

560
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,810
Tomorrow, we go our separate ways.

561
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,357
Pack up your share. We eat and sleep.

562
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,443
Will, you're on first watch.

563
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,673
Will.

564
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,663
Watch your step!

565
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,665
One of them got away.

566
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,753
Bastards! They've stolen my fortune.

567
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,506
Richard's army is coming home.

568
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,383
It costs money to keep it together.

569
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,760
Marshal, you speak for the money.

570
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,011
I do, Sire.

571
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,556
But to disband the army could cost more than to keep it.

572
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,189
King Richard's campaigns were costly.

573
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,524
What is that to me, Marshal?

574
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,819
My brother's troubles are over!

575
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,697
They're over!

576
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:42,992
Clear the room.

577
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,757
So... taxation.

578
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,008
Taxation?

579
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,355
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing but

580
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:03,429
kicked off the milking stool.

581
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,640
Mother, spare me your farmyard memories.

582
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,392
You have none, and I don't understand them.

583
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,228
These are difficult times.

584
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,146
We can buy time.

585
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,899
I can send envoys to secure loans.

586
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,481
There are money chests from Sicily to

587
00:53:16,482 --> 00:53:17,860
Normandy if you know where to look.

588
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,029
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

589
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,906
Your master's a King.

590
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,951
The crown is owed money at home.

591
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,087
The northern Barons plead poverty,

592
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,247
but that's always been the song of rich men.

593
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,166
So, what's to be done?

594
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,018
Give me leave, Sire, to go north with a company of mounted men.

595
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,896
I'll have the merchants and landowners fill your coffers.

596
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,982
Or their coffins.

597
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,484
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

598
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,612
No man loyal to the crown has anything to fear.

599
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:07,201
And loyalty means paying your share in the defence of the realm.

600
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,912
That's well said.

601
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,498
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

602
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,168
Mother?

603
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:20,339
Richard commanded loyalty not by threats but by example.

604
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,593
Mother, your sainted son was an imbecile.

605
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,530
And you supported his every folly

606
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:29,015
from here to Jerusalem and back.

607
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,852
Yes, you worshipped him.

608
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,814
When the warrior lost territories hard won by his father.

609
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,108
You kissed his picture.

610
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,445
While England had to pay four years' revenue

611
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,197
to ransom him when he was captured.

612
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,782
You are just as much to blame as anyone,

613
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,243
for the wreckage which is my inheritance.

614
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,968
I broke her skin more than she did mine.

615
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,894
Chancellor.

616
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,360
Marshal,

617
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,782
you served my brother faithfully and my father before him.

618
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,203
I think you've spent enough time with my family.

619
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,872
And, no doubt, would like to spend more with your own.

620
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,252
Therefore, and with regret,

621
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,473
I accept your resignation of

622
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,214
all your offices and matters of state.

623
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,885
The ring.

624
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,395
Your Majesty.

625
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,401
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot

626
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:20,209
 where you would place your dagger.

627
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,637
For I will choose carefully, as well.

628
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,579
Open the gates!

629
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,908
Nottingham.

630
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,577
Is this your people, Robin?

631
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,995
I don't know. Might be.

632
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,832
They don't look much, these middle Englanders.

633
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,230
Well, they've been keeping your lot in place

634
00:57:43,231 --> 00:57:44,543
easy enough, haven't they?

635
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,463
I hear that you welsh boys, you live on leeks.

636
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,840
You co-habit with sheep.

637
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,095
Bloody scottish mule.

638
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,308
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive with your noise, would you?

639
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,310
Your swords would be no good then, gentlemen.

640
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,686
You're the town beekeeper?

641
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,774
Bless you, no. I'm the Friar. Tuck's the name.

642
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,734
Well, Friar Tuck,

643
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,320
can you tell me

644
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,823
If he's not up at Peper Harow...

645
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,201
How long will your business take?

646
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,332
Stay safe.

647
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,334
God be with you all.

648
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,634
That's it?

649
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,177
After 10 years?

650
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,640
Good Friar, where can a man get, well,

651
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,851
moderately insensible on a drink around here?

652
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,354
Allan, he's a man of the cloth. I'm sorry, Friar.

653
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,023
- Have you coin?

654
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,191
- I have coin.

655
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,943
Two pieces.

656
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,862
Each.

657
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,949
Have you tried the honey liquor we call Mead?

658
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,453
Come with me.

659
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,372
Gives a man a halo, does Mead.

660
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,155
Girl.

661
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,199
Girl?

662
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,581
Either you're going blind or you're looking for charity.

663
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,042
Are you the keeper of this house?

664
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,336
In a manner of speaking, yes.

665
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,546
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

666
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,300
And you are?

667
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,635
Robin Longstride.

668
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,678
Plain Robin Longstride? No Sir?

669
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,264
No, ma'am. No Sir.

670
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,102
Are you here about the tax?

671
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,399
No, I'm here to bring him his sword. His son's dead.

672
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,111
This way.

673
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,885
He'll take your horse.

674
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:52,982
Marion!

675
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,942
Marion!

676
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,403
Maggie, where is she?

677
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,239
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

678
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,700
I know, Margaret. I can hear him.

679
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,244
Tell him we have a guest.

680
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,007
I'm Marion Loxley. Robert's wife.

681
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,097
My lady, I owe you an apology. If I'd have known...

682
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,642
Bad news is bad news no matter how it comes.

683
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,084
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking the time

684
01:01:32,085 --> 01:01:34,356
to deliver it here yourself.

685
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,693
Did you fight alongside my husband?

686
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,404
Yes.

687
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,157
Did he die well?

688
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,579
In an ambush, ma'am.

689
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,207
He was the man chosen to bring home Richard's crown.

690
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,501
Marion, who is here?

691
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,588
A traveller, Walter.

692
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,638
This news will go very hard on him.

693
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,805
Bring him in.

694
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,140
Yes, yes.

695
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,933
Tell him Robert is in the Holy Land,

696
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,894
sends his love and will return soon.

697
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,230
Marion, our traveller will be thirsty.

698
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,485
Travellers are always thirsty. Is that not so?

699
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,611
Your name, Sir?

700
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,906
Longstride. Robin longstride.

701
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,660
Do you mock me?

702
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,579
Sir?

703
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,123
Your son,

704
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,710
he asked me to bring you this.

705
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,682
And how does Robert defend himself if he has no sword?

706
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,186
The prodigal son will not return after all.

707
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:01,026
So, no tears, no forgiveness from his father.

708
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,074
No amends to be made.

709
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,418
Did you see him die?

710
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,964
I was with him when he passed.

711
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,465
His final words were for the l

712
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:25,968
ove and bond between a father and son.

713
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,846
Forgive my rudeness.

714
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,808
My grief has been waiting for this day.

715
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:37,020
So come, so that I may see you.

716
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,496
Robin Longstride.

717
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,084
A common enough but noble Saxon name.

718
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,339
So, you will dine with us.

719
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,260
But first, you must bathe, sir.

720
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,803
You stink.

721
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,937
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.

722
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,940
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.

723
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,651
My Lady,

724
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,739
I'll need some help with the chain mail.

725
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:35,120
Winifred.

726
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,216
Winifred.

727
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,770
The coif has a clasp at the nape of the neck.

728
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:00,687
If you take off the coif, you'll find lacings in the back of the tabard.

729
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,767
Thank you.

730
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,602
I'll have it washed.

731
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,705
Marion, more wine.

732
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,629
You've taken a long road to bring this to me.

733
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:11,091
I cannot decide whether that makes you trustworthy...

734
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,467
or manipulative.

735
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,721
Marion,

736
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,473
I'm merely trying to gauge the quality of the man we have as our guest.

737
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,434
Is he handsome?

738
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,311
Yes.

739
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:27,816
In the way that yeomen sometimes are when they are sober.

740
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,819
Entertain us with a tale of your life, Sir.

741
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,156
We don't get many visitors any more.

742
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,992
Except tax collectors and other beggars.

743
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:41,038
I don't know where I'm from. Only know where I've been.

744
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:44,499
So, Marion, what colour are his eyes?

745
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,214
I don't yet know.

746
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:56,595
I have a proposal for you, young man.

747
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:01,266
You brought me this sword, which has great meaning.

748
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,310
If you give me your time,

749
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,687
it is yours.

750
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,525
I could stay for a day, or more.

751
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,529
I have a question to ask you.

752
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,865
And what is your question?

753
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,952
The words on the hilt of the sword, what do they mean?

754
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,475
Well, I think I have much to tell you

755
01:07:23,476 --> 01:07:25,832
about history, about your history.

756
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,299
That's very kind.

757
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,552
Well, you haven't heard the other half of my proposal yet.

758
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:41,640
I want you to stay in Nottingham and, for the time being,

759
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,852
become my returned son, and therefore Marion's spouse.

760
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,187
Oh, that's enough!

761
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,814
- You've had too much to drink.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

762
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,066
We both know that without a husband

763
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,235
you will lose this land when I die.

764
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,570
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

765
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,573
No.

766
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:04,079
he will be seen as that. And, so as your husband, huh?

767
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,914
It is a fair contract.

768
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:11,128
It is not as if I expect you to have children or...

769
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:15,215
No, the sword for your time, Longstride.

770
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,591
Are you in agreement?

771
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:19,678
- Yes.
-Marion, go

772
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,430
 tell the staff,

773
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:26,017
that my son has arrived and our home is now whole again.

774
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,771
Tell them to ring the church bells in celebration.

775
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,482
And more wine, please.

776
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,578
Hey! Hey!

777
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,042
I rose up in the morning.

778
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,336
And I felt a dire need,

779
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,923
to dream away the dreary day and down a cup of Mead.

780
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,092
I felt the sting of honeybees.

781
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,844
Home brew.

782
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,600
If I wasn't the village priest, I'd try for the village drunkard.

783
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,853
Oh, great.

784
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,356
A man could get very affectionate here.

785
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:18,904
I haven't seen so many women for so few men outside a nunnery.

786
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:24,117
The secret to success is never go for the prettiest one.

787
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,078
Start with the homely one on the left.

788
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,292
Right there.

789
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,754
She's about my size. I'm going to make her smile.

790
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,132
I'm going to make you smile!

791
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,675
Come over here!

792
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,678
So, why do they call you little John?

793
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,222
What are you trying to get at?

794
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,724
I'm proportionate.

795
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,519
So roll another barrel to the bar,

796
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,356
and pour another cup or two so I can soak my heart.

797
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,614
Stop it.

798
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,411
What did I tell you?

799
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,798
It seems we are to share my chamber.

800
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,093
A ruse to convince the servants.

801
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,514
Well, if the aim is deception,

802
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:15,437
should you not be addressing me as "my husband,"

803
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,648
Don't be ridiculous.

804
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,613
Well, are you coming or not?

805
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,035
Ask me nicely.

806
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:41,796
Please, dear husband, will you share my chamber?

807
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,668
Here.

808
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,423
I sleep with a dagger.

809
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:29,427
If you so much as move to touch me,

810
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:30,762
You understand?

811
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,180
Thanks for the warning.

812
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,355
Hello, dogs.

813
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,263
Godfrey.

814
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,567
Where are your men?

815
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,820
They're dead, my Lord.

816
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,072
And Loxley?

817
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,532
Alive.

818
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,578
Then fate has left him to me.

819
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:16,928
I hear a man's steps. Good morning, my son.

820
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:18,847
Morning, Walter.

821
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,057
Father.

822
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,143
Father.

823
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,229
So what is it that you know of my history?

824
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,564
Patience.

825
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,526
You must show yourself today. Wear your sword.

826
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,279
Marion.

827
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,364
I'm here, Walter.

828
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:40,243
Reacquaint your husband with his village and his people.

829
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:44,497
I'll see to the horses.

830
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,624
I feel invigorated.

831
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:49,919
I woke this morning with a tumescent glow.

832
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:51,754
Eighty-four.

833
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,132
A miracle.

834
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:58,678
I've always wondered at the private conversations of men.

835
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,431
Husband.

836
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,620
This is a rich country.

837
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,206
Where's your cattle and your sheep?

838
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:30,251
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.

839
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,129
Our meat now is rabbit,

840
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,882
or wild pig on a lucky day.

841
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:36,966
And deer?

842
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:41,512
If you're willing to risk your neck to the King's executioner.

843
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,557
Every deer in the land belongs to his Majesty.

844
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:47,185
These things are God's gifts first before the King's possessions.

845
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,814
If it's illegal for a man to fend for himself,

846
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,650
how then can he be a man in his own right?

847
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,735
Welcome home, Sir.

848
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:56,861
Sir Robert.

849
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,988
Good morning, Joseph, Emma.

850
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:02,353
Sir Walter is our Lord,

851
01:17:02,354 --> 01:17:04,285
and you are Robert returned and you should act so.

852
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,040
Sir Robert. You remember me?

853
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,834
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

854
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:13,753
You don't look a day older, Tom.

855
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,256
Sir Robert.

856
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,716
When will our young lads come back to us?

857
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,845
Will you find my Jamie, tell him to come home?

858
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,435
With no work and little food, the village boys have gone.

859
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,853
- To be soldiers?

860
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,188
- Poachers.

861
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:38,695
Look at that, mate.

862
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,449
Still here then?

863
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,460
For the time being, refer to me as Sir Robert. I'l

864
01:17:47,461 --> 01:17:49,330
l explain later.

865
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,543
My men-at-arms. This is about as courtly as they get.

866
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,380
Allan Adayle, Will Scarlet and little John.

867
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,715
Lady Marion.

868
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:08,349
I trust you had an historic evening.

869
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,184
For sure.

870
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,942
Lady Marion Loxley, my wife.

871
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,069
Well played.

872
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,157
A bit rash but well played nonetheless.

873
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,658
Right you are, Robin.

874
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,452
Sir Robert.

875
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,120
- Sir Robert.
- Sir...

876
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,497
- Sir.
- Sir.

877
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,249
- Sir Bob.
- Sir Robert.

878
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:41,632
Friar.

879
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:47,972
Ah, Marion. Good news travels from Peper Harow this morning.

880
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,351
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

881
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,393
You should've made yourself known when we met i

882
01:18:53,394 --> 01:18:55,146
n the field. Welcome home.

883
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,524
Yes, I should've. Forgive me, Friar.

884
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:00,777
What happens here?

885
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,738
We're moving the church's grain to York.

886
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,573
Politics out of London, I hear.

887
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,618
This is our grain. It belongs in this soil.

888
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,704
Lady Marion, I but follow the orders of my superiors

889
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,207
and abide by their saying and rule.

890
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,672
Does his holiness know about your wealth of honey?

891
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,845
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert. voracious wolves.

892
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,973
The bees are my family.

893
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:33,559
I'm a procreator by design.

894
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,021
I'm not a churchy Friar. Never was.

895
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,649
My bees give life.

896
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,068
They are my life, Sir Robert.

897
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,070
Should not the bishop be told

898
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:47,323
so the clergy can spread Nottingham honey

899
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,538
What if the grain were not to reach York?

900
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:58,334
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

901
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,680
I was an old maid when Robert courted me.

902
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:13,135
I was a daughter of a respectable widow

903
01:20:13,136 --> 01:20:15,143
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

904
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:19,313
We were wed, and then a week later

905
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:23,442
He left to join ship for France and the Holy Lands.

906
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,571
And that was my married life to a man

907
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,283
I hardly knew.

908
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,746
A good knight.  Short, but sweet.

909
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,959
I mean, he was a good knight.

910
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,503
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

911
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,922
Oh, yes, my knight-in-arms, even so.

912
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,757
And I in his.

913
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,082
Stop! You'll break its neck.

914
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,388
Marion.

915
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,607
Easy.

916
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,528
I'm all right.

917
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:56,118
I can't move me legs.

918
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,747
Thank you.

919
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,293
My Lord?

920
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,141
Oh, is it my turn now?

921
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,485
Thank you.

922
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,990
Nicely done, Sir.

923
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,492
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,

924
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,911
Beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

925
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:45,084
I don't believe you know my husband,

926
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:46,585
Sir Robert.

927
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,256
Allow me to introduce the sheriff of Nottingham.

928
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,091
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

929
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:54,351
You make your mark quickly

930
01:22:54,352 --> 01:22:56,012
by rescuing the king's ram from drowning.

931
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:57,596
What's this?

932
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:59,977
What's mine in coin I have the right

933
01:22:59,978 --> 01:23:01,892
to take in goods or livestock.

934
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,895
If it's god's will.

935
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,985
Here's a ram's worth of tax for the exchequer.

936
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,446
Your insolence to lady marion,

937
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,531
I'll consider a debt between us.

938
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:43,893
Mead and grain alcohol?

939
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,853
I thought as much.

940
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,692
There's something that we need to do.

941
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,527
At your service.

942
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,124
All right, lads.

943
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,722
Should've left while you had the chance.

944
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:11,545
Something's afoot. Off we go.

945
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,230
Stop. Stop the horses.

946
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,985
You there! Move aside! We're on church business!

947
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:37,905
None shall pass

948
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:40,533
unless they can answer the riddle.

949
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:42,827
Moon-mad!

950
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,580
And what is the riddle, you insolent wretch?

951
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:51,919
What has 18 legs and isn't going anywhere?

952
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,258
Your next move will be your last.

953
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,760
Evening, friend.

954
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,931
I demand to know who you are.

955
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:05,808
We are men of the hood.

956
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,104
Merry now, at your expense.

957
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,857
The Lord taketh...

958
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,316
and we shall giveth back.

959
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,944
My advice is to plant it now, by moonlight.

960
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,320
Why is that, good Friar?

961
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:21,490
When it sprouts, I can claim it as a miracle from God.

962
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,618
The church in York would never deny a miracle.

963
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,040
- How much further?

964
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,542
- About 11 miles.

965
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:23,761
I thought you had left.

966
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:26,931
The fields have been planted.

967
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,975
I didn't want to wake you.

968
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,977
How did you find the seed?

969
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,813
If you have to ask, it's not a gift.

970
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,859
Thank you.

971
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,823
Pikemen, at the ready!

972
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,241
Arms to ready!

973
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,326
Prepare!

974
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,621
This King John is no King of mine!

975
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,001
You! Are you Baldwin? Open these gates!

976
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,836
In whose name do you come against us?

977
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,754
In the name of King John.

978
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,924
Pay or burn.

979
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:47,511
We have paid in money and men for King Richard's wars!

980
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,638
And we have no more to give!

981
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,682
- Burn it.
- Archers!

982
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,120
Come on.

983
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,925
My Lord, this way!

984
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,223
In the name of John,

985
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:36,393
by the grace of God, King of England,

986
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:41,899
let it be known to all who abide here that a tax is warranted!

987
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:51,325
Those persons refusing to abide by the law

988
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:54,620
will hereby be subject to severe punishment.

989
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:02,503
By order of his Majesty, King John.

990
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,349
Father Tancred!

991
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:34,451
Your Majesty.

992
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,248
Your Majesty.

993
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,753
I have lost the confidence of King John,

994
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,131
But he may still listen to you.

995
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,466
Allow me to know better, William.

996
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,136
You are much wiser than your owl.

997
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,472
I dare say. I've lived longer.

998
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,517
Edward, take him.

999
01:29:58,601 --> 01:29:59,685
Your Majesty.

1000
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:06,525
John is no Richard, alas, your Majesty.

1001
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:13,323
But I serve the throne, and the throne will endure.

1002
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:18,996
Speak plainly, Marshal. What's troubling you?

1003
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,748
The crown is in peril.

1004
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:26,211
Godfrey has been plotting with Philip of France.

1005
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,256
French troops have already landed on our shores,

1006
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,092
And they are murdering Englishmen in the name of King John.

1007
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:36,930
The northern Barons will make civil war against the throne.

1008
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:40,559
Leaving our coast defenceless against the invasion

1009
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,270
which is certainly coming.

1010
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,326
So it's left to John's mother to scold

1011
01:30:48,327 --> 01:30:50,736
him like a child and point him to his duty.

1012
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:01,121
My son has an enemy in his court closer to him than any friend.

1013
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,791
An English traitor. A paid agent of France.

1014
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,962
Why are you telling me when you must tell the king?

1015
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,464
Isabella!

1016
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:13,800
It is you who must do that.

1017
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,637
Tell King John that you've had word from France, from Philip himself,

1018
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,472
if you like.

1019
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,059
Why not tell him the truth?

1020
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,396
Oh! A mother he mistrusts

1021
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:27,689
No.

1022
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:32,986
If you wish to be queen, you must save John.

1023
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,948
And England.

1024
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:38,617
No!

1025
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,286
No! No!

1026
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:47,167
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

1027
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,504
By the bowels of Christ, it's a lie.

1028
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,422
You lie!

1029
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,318
I'm sorry, my love.

1030
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,295
- Sheriff.
- Up there.

1031
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:38,302
Man won't give his name. Demands audience with the Sheriff.

1032
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:40,095
Demands?

1033
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,224
- Go away.

1034
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,392
- My Lord.

1035
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:10,167
Tax collections proceed apace.

1036
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,919
Nottingham's turn is coming.

1037
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,213
Good. Good.

1038
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:19,176
Tell Sir Godfrey that the Sheriff of Nottingham is his man.

1039
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,970
May he put his stamp on my authority.

1040
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:26,850
I see trouble coming from Loxley of Peper Harow.

1041
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,269
A blind old man gives you trouble?

1042
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,521
Aye, and his son will give more.

1043
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:35,901
The crusader, Robert Loxley,

1044
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,690
Marion.

1045
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,505
Go on! Go on.

1046
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,554
Has he spoken yet?

1047
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,930
He was spying, Loop.

1048
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,807
Spying?

1049
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,811
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

1050
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:36,563
Hello, Marion.

1051
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,398
I've come to save you.

1052
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,817
Know him?

1053
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:46,156
Boys,

1054
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,701
Sir Robert, the runaways of Sherwood.

1055
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:51,995
Untie him.

1056
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,874
No, I don't think spies should be let off so easily.

1057
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,834
That was unkind.

1058
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,711
You were a crusader?

1059
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:00,921
Yes.

1060
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,965
Did you hear that, boys? You bested a crusader.

1061
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:06,343
- My men are good fighters.

1062
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,594
- I don't know about that.

1063
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:10,096
I think the weight of numbers might have been in their favour.

1064
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,933
But they do move silently

1065
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,101
But that's only a skill if you stay as a man.

1066
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,270
You don't become the creatures you hunt.

1067
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,438
- We're soldiers.

1068
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:19,689
- No, you're not.

1069
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:22,901
Soldiers fight for a cause. What's yours?

1070
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:28,114
You don't have one. That makes you poachers.

1071
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,786
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

1072
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,954
Like what?

1073
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,289
I could teach you how to tie knots.

1074
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:39,292
I could teach you which wood to get to make your bows stronger.

1075
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:43,588
I could teach you how to make arrows that fly more than 20 feet.

1076
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,384
And I can help Marion to teach you how to stay clean

1077
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:49,469
so you won't get sick.

1078
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:53,306
I don't know who you're fighting, son, but it's not me.

1079
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,558
I'm not your enemy.

1080
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:58,562
If you want to chat, you know where to find me.

1081
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:13,952
Wife?

1082
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:22,961
Marshal.

1083
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,006
Stand aside! Make way for the king!

1084
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,132
Your Majesty.

1085
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:32,304
What the devil are you doing here? Hmm?

1086
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,513
Sire?

1087
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,099
Will you keep that animal still? What's it got, palsy?

1088
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,937
Do you think I haven't noticed how you've deserted me?

1089
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:43,565
If your Majesty recalls, our last conversation...

1090
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,025
At our last conversation,

1091
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,403
Philip of France wasn't coming our way with an invasion fleet.

1092
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:50,822
Was he, Marshal?

1093
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,411
My friend Godfrey

1094
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,873
is not the friend I thought he was.

1095
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,710
He's stirred up the Northern Barons against me.

1096
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:06,588
They come south with an army.

1097
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,675
Marshal, how dare they? How dare they?

1098
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,595
Sire, forgotten men are dangerous men.

1099
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:18,350
The Barons need to be told

1100
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:22,354
that when the French come, we are all Englishmen.

1101
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:24,773
- Fitzrobert.

1102
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:26,107
- Baldwin.

1103
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,819
We'll make an army of the North and march on London.

1104
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:32,113
The Barons need leadership.

1105
01:38:33,115 --> 01:38:36,993
Wiser kings know they must let men look them in the eye,

1106
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,788
hear their voice.

1107
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:43,792
Together, let us ride north to meet them.

1108
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:49,506
They march against their King, Marshal.

1109
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,134
Their King.

1110
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,546
We will meet them with the pikes of

1111
01:38:56,547 --> 01:38:58,431
 our militia in their gizzards.

1112
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,643
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

1113
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:06,314
Perhaps we'll look to the Barons without you.

1114
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:20,620
Saddle up with a spare horse. I leave immediately.

1115
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:22,247
I want to know where to find Godfrey.

1116
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:23,665
My lord.

1117
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,223
- I found him, my lord.

1118
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:41,391
- Where?

1119
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:45,729
Nottingham.

1120
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,695
In plain sight, living as Walter Loxley's son.

1121
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:57,198
Then we go to Nottingham.

1122
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,203
Take no prisoners. Leave no stone un-scorched.

1123
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,483
Take two men, four horses.

1124
01:40:04,484 --> 01:40:06,541
Ride hard for the coast, then on to Paris and give a message to the King.

1125
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,853
I'll make the place famous.

1126
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,858
Come, Allan!

1127
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:35,069
I'll get them drinking. You get them dancing!

1128
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:36,237
All right.

1129
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:12,315
Music, laughter, the crackle of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

1130
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:16,152
Life has returned. You have returned it, Robin.

1131
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:18,358
How did you know it was me?

1132
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:22,028
Who else would sit by me uninvited

1133
01:43:22,821 --> 01:43:25,448
like a friend from the old days?

1134
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:27,659
How are you, William?

1135
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,287
I'm well and troubled.

1136
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:33,873
Ah. And what brings you?

1137
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:37,001
I'm riding on to Barnsdale tonight.

1138
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:39,411
I've heard something of the Barons'

1139
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:41,381
anger against the crown's tax collector...

1140
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:43,883
The anger has turned into action.

1141
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,135
They assemble to march against the King.

1142
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,805
You think you can persuade the Barons to turn back?

1143
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:49,973
Turn back, no.

1144
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:55,144
To join King John

1145
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:58,481
- A what?
- Help me, Walter.

1146
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,775
I cannot go with you.

1147
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,444
I cannot speak for this King.

1148
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:05,113
He is the only King we have.

1149
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:06,614
But not the only hope.

1150
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,866
Explain.

1151
01:44:10,452 --> 01:44:11,494
- Marion.

1152
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:12,662
- I'm here, Walter.

1153
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,248
This is my old friend, William Marshal.

1154
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,834
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

1155
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,753
Lady,

1156
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:23,339
I think you know better, Marshal.

1157
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:28,177
Sir William,

1158
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:40,773
We've met before.

1159
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,276
Yes, Sir, I know. in London.

1160
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,530
No, when you were a child.

1161
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:51,034
Hobby-horse age.

1162
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:55,705
Sir Walter and I returned from the Holy Land to fetch you home.

1163
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:57,457
But you'd gone.

1164
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:00,710
We had lost Thomas Longstride's son.

1165
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:06,799
It was a wound that never healed.

1166
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,726
You need to know what I know.

1167
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,688
Your father was a stonemason.

1168
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,900
Is that pleasing to you?

1169
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,237
Yes, it is.

1170
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,074
But he was more than that. He was a visionary.

1171
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,577
What did he see?

1172
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,622
That Kings have a need of their subjects,

1173
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:41,751
no less than their subjects have need of Kings.

1174
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,503
A dangerous idea.

1175
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:47,340
Your father was a philosopher.

1176
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,551
that took you by the ears and by the heart.

1177
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:53,596
None of these things can be written down, Robin.

1178
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,682
You must commit them to your very soul.

1179
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:59,060
This is the science of memory.

1180
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:05,149
"Rise and rise again until lambs become lions."

1181
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:12,615
Finally, hundreds listened, thousands,

1182
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:16,160
for the rights of all ranks from Baron to serf.

1183
01:46:19,289 --> 01:46:20,957
"Rise and rise again,

1184
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,461
until lambs become lions."

1185
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,385
What happened to him?

1186
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,762
Close your eyes.

1187
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:45,356
... foundation is set on the rights of liberty for all people!

1188
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:53,406
Longstride, give up the charter and their names!

1189
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,157
You were there.

1190
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:56,742
You saw it.

1191
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:01,414
I will not.

1192
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:26,981
Not dead.

1193
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:33,863
Not now.

1194
01:47:38,201 --> 01:47:41,913
Here is my copy of the main contract.

1195
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:45,833
This charter of rights was written by your father.

1196
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:47,913
And here are...

1197
01:47:47,914 --> 01:47:49,962
There are the names of all the Barons that signed the charter.

1198
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:53,090
Fitzrobert, Baldwin, Marshal and myself.

1199
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,261
What he wanted was a charter for every man...

1200
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:58,429
- Wait there.

1201
01:47:58,513 --> 01:47:59,889
- to have the same rights.

1202
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,474
Sir Walter? A messenger for you.

1203
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:03,100
Bring him in.

1204
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:04,727
Step forward, sir.

1205
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:06,687
- My Lord.

1206
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:09,482
- I'm listening.

1207
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,775
Peterborough's been burned by the King's men.

1208
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:12,944
Fitzrobert gathers an army

1209
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:16,489
to slay King John in London.

1210
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,742
Marshal requests your presence at counsel in Barnsdale.

1211
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:23,663
Wait outside, will you?

1212
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,750
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

1213
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,337
The time for pretence is over.

1214
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:35,675
Now, hold me like a son.

1215
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,141
Go.

1216
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:48,437
Maggie. Where's my Lady?

1217
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:50,106
I could not find her, Sir.

1218
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:20,970
Whether we fight for our lives,

1219
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:22,972
we must fight till the death.

1220
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,809
You've spent too long in the palace, William.

1221
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:30,229
Spending time in the palace gives me perspective.

1222
01:49:31,356 --> 01:49:32,815
As we speak,

1223
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:36,861
King Philip sails for our coast.

1224
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:42,366
Godfrey and his marauders are French!

1225
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:46,954
Every minute that we waste in disunity

1226
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:50,291
brings closer the destruction of our country!

1227
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,418
We have been bled

1228
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,838
by the king long before Godfrey.

1229
01:49:56,214 --> 01:49:59,008
Go back to London and tell the King

1230
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:03,471
that we will meet him on a field of his choice.

1231
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:04,597
Make way!

1232
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:07,308
We will not fight to save John's crown.

1233
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:10,603
Rather let him bend the knee to us.

1234
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:14,023
I'll give you more, Sir Baldwin.

1235
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:17,526
My breast for your sword point.

1236
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:20,863
Use mine.

1237
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:26,452
Go on.

1238
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,038
No?

1239
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:33,501
Oh, this is what you want, isn't it?

1240
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:37,546
Fine, I'd rather give it to you

1241
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:40,800
You mistake me, Sire.

1242
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:44,595
I have no right and no ambition to wear the crown.

1243
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,973
But let the rightful wearer beware.

1244
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:50,434
From now we will be subject only

1245
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:52,478
to laws that we have a hand in making.

1246
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:57,316
We are not sheep to be made mutton of by your butchers.

1247
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:02,780
Godfrey set himself to turn you against me.

1248
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:06,033
Then he did more than was needed to accomplish that.

1249
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,748
A very important decision.

1250
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:15,424
Don't you think that we've paid

1251
01:51:15,425 --> 01:51:17,002
too much taxes for far too long...

1252
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:26,697
This is where I was born.

1253
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:42,963
What does it mean?

1254
01:52:43,048 --> 01:52:44,548
It means never give up.

1255
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:50,512
We will not be loyal to a crown

1256
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,099
The king must listen to what we have to say!

1257
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:56,402
A king does not bargain for the loyalty

1258
01:52:56,403 --> 01:52:58,979
that every subject owes him.

1259
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:03,776
Without loyalty there is no kingdom.

1260
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,279
I'm here to speak for sir Walter Loxley.

1261
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,659
Let the man speak. Let him speak!

1262
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,119
Speak! Speak!

1263
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:16,956
Speak, if you must.

1264
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:21,377
If you're trying to build for the future,

1265
01:53:22,045 --> 01:53:24,588
you must set your foundation strong.

1266
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:30,886
The laws of this land

1267
01:53:32,555 --> 01:53:36,809
a king who demands loyalty but offers nothing in return.

1268
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:41,230
I have marched from France

1269
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:43,857
to Palestine and back.

1270
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:46,235
And I know

1271
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:49,989
in tyranny lies only failure.

1272
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:54,118
You build a country like you build a cathedral,

1273
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:55,494
from the ground up.

1274
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:58,872
Empower every man

1275
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:01,292
...and you will gain strength.

1276
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:06,797
Well, who could object to such reasonable words?

1277
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:12,928
If your Majesty were to offer justice,

1278
01:54:14,139 --> 01:54:16,473
justice in the form of a charter of liberties,

1279
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,936
allowing every man to forage for his hearth,

1280
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:25,190
to be safe from conviction without cause

1281
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,276
or prison without charge,

1282
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:32,072
to work, eat and live on the sweat of his own brow

1283
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,825
and be as merry as he can...

1284
01:54:34,909 --> 01:54:36,577
Sir, Godfrey's men are on to Nottingham.

1285
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:39,747
...then that King would be great.

1286
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:44,084
Not only would he receive the loyalty of his people,

1287
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:46,879
but their love, as well.

1288
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:51,133
So what would you have? Hmm?

1289
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:52,968
Castle for every man?

1290
01:54:55,305 --> 01:54:57,473
Every Englishman's home is his castle.

1291
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,643
What we would ask, your Majesty,

1292
01:55:03,104 --> 01:55:04,563
is liberty.

1293
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:07,024
Liberty by law!

1294
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:11,320
Your Majesty, my Lords,

1295
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,698
the French fleet is in the channel.

1296
01:55:14,783 --> 01:55:19,787
Sire, you have a chance to unify your subjects high and low.

1297
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:23,207
It falls on your nod.

1298
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:25,918
I only have to nod?

1299
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:31,590
I can do better than that.

1300
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:35,844
I give my word,

1301
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:39,598
that such a charter will be written.

1302
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:43,018
On my mother's life, I swear it.

1303
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:51,527
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.

1304
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:53,654
I will send Baldwin and Fitzrobert with you.

1305
01:55:53,738 --> 01:55:57,533
We will meet again at the White Horse

1306
01:55:57,617 --> 01:56:00,661
Robin, your father was a great man.

1307
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,206
And you are your father's son.

1308
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:16,718
Maggie, who's at the house?

1309
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:19,596
Long live the King!

1310
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,842
Gentlemen.

1311
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:13,775
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1312
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:20,616
I'm French on my mother's side.

1313
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:44,848
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

1314
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,316
Loxley!

1315
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:56,235
Show yourself!

1316
01:57:58,363 --> 01:57:59,655
Loxley!

1317
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:03,867
Who calls here?

1318
01:58:04,535 --> 01:58:06,495
I call for Robert Loxley.

1319
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:08,705
My son is not here to answer you.

1320
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:10,123
That is the truth.

1321
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,084
Because he's dead in a French ditch.

1322
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:15,879
And who are you, Sir, to say so?

1323
01:58:17,715 --> 01:58:19,258
Who am I?

1324
01:58:27,725 --> 01:58:28,892
I'm the one who killed him.

1325
01:58:31,521 --> 01:58:33,021
Fight me if you dare.

1326
01:58:34,148 --> 01:58:35,565
Lord have mercy.

1327
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:26,074
Leave it on the table. Leave it! Next!

1328
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,702
Next! Come on!

1329
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:32,205
- Name?
- Loxley.

1330
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:34,249
Christian name?

1331
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,917
Marion.

1332
01:59:36,753 --> 01:59:38,462
Land?

1333
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:40,422
5,000 acres.

1334
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:43,175
Lady Marion Loxley?

1335
01:59:43,885 --> 01:59:45,469
I am.

1336
02:00:14,665 --> 02:00:17,751
Gentlemen, enjoy!

1337
02:00:51,202 --> 02:00:53,120
No one should have 4,000 acres.

1338
02:00:53,204 --> 02:00:55,205
5,000 acres.

1339
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:35,597
Baldwin! Fitzrobert!

1340
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:38,183
Take the southern flank and circle in from the west.

1341
02:02:38,809 --> 02:02:41,394
Will and Allan,

1342
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,167
Lady Marion.

1343
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:27,023
Quickly.

1344
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:54,551
Follow me.

1345
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:20,744
Somebody, please take the baby! Save the baby, please!

1346
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:31,755
John, down!

1347
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:39,179
It's all right.

1348
02:04:39,263 --> 02:04:40,430
Go around.

1349
02:04:40,514 --> 02:04:41,765
Stand back!

1350
02:04:43,601 --> 02:04:44,642
Make way!

1351
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:49,898
Hurry. It's all right. It's all right. Please, hurry! Hurry!

1352
02:05:01,577 --> 02:05:02,702
Sword!

1353
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:24,557
Get down, you bastard French dogs!

1354
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:18,069
Where will King Philip land and when?

1355
02:06:31,917 --> 02:06:33,877
This is my last arrow.

1356
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:39,424
Dungeness! Dungeness. Two days.

1357
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:45,972
There we have it. We have two days.

1358
02:08:12,601 --> 02:08:15,186
Once before I said goodbye to a man going to war.

1359
02:08:16,146 --> 02:08:17,480
He never came back.

1360
02:08:23,862 --> 02:08:25,238
Ask me nicely.

1361
02:09:00,274 --> 02:09:01,566
I love you, Marion.

1362
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,628
Longstride!

1363
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:00,745
What news of Walter and Nottingham?

1364
02:12:01,997 --> 02:12:04,582
Sir Walter is dead. Godfrey's hand.

1365
02:12:04,666 --> 02:12:07,418
Gentlemen, we go to war.

1366
02:12:07,628 --> 02:12:10,338
It is my first time. I shall lead.

1367
02:12:10,422 --> 02:12:12,465
Forward!

1368
02:13:52,566 --> 02:13:54,191
That's a lot of French.

1369
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:58,195
What's to be done?

1370
02:13:59,573 --> 02:14:00,698
Archers to the cliff top.

1371
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:04,368
Cavalry to the beach. We'll await you there.

1372
02:14:04,745 --> 02:14:05,786
- With me!

1373
02:14:05,871 --> 02:14:07,038
- Archers!

1374
02:14:09,374 --> 02:14:11,167
Excellent plan.

1375
02:14:32,856 --> 02:14:34,065
Cavalry!

1376
02:14:46,286 --> 02:14:47,745
Ready!

1377
02:15:07,349 --> 02:15:08,808
Raise arrows! Raise arrows!

1378
02:15:08,892 --> 02:15:10,184
Raise arrows! Raise arrows!

1379
02:15:11,144 --> 02:15:12,228
Ready!

1380
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:17,817
Raise arrows!

1381
02:15:18,235 --> 02:15:20,111
Release! Release!

1382
02:15:32,624 --> 02:15:33,708
Release!

1383
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:12,079
For the love of God, Marion!

1384
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:17,793
Loxley,

1385
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:21,047
circle your troops and then join the charge.

1386
02:16:26,178 --> 02:16:27,303
With me!

1387
02:16:32,184 --> 02:16:33,309
Release!

1388
02:16:44,529 --> 02:16:45,571
Release!

1389
02:17:33,161 --> 02:17:35,371
Forward!

1390
02:17:53,348 --> 02:17:54,932
Archers, forward!

1391
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:23,794
Let's go, Marshal.

1392
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:25,004
We're close enough, Sire.

1393
02:18:26,047 --> 02:18:27,882
This was not close enough for Rchard.

1394
02:18:27,966 --> 02:18:29,800
And look what happened to him.

1395
02:18:30,844 --> 02:18:31,886
Forward!

1396
02:18:32,929 --> 02:18:34,305
Protect the king!

1397
02:19:05,587 --> 02:19:07,379
This is for you, Walter.

1398
02:19:20,477 --> 02:19:23,479
No!

1399
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:32,029
Marion!

1400
02:21:15,425 --> 02:21:16,884
Marion!

1401
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:45,954
Surrender!

1402
02:22:08,561 --> 02:22:10,521
Sire! Sire!

1403
02:22:10,855 --> 02:22:12,940
They've surrendered, Sire!

1404
02:22:13,274 --> 02:22:15,442
Yes! To whom?

1405
02:22:19,322 --> 02:22:20,489
To him.

1406
02:22:20,573 --> 02:22:22,449
Longstride!

1407
02:22:24,119 --> 02:22:39,132
Longstride!

1408
02:23:17,005 --> 02:23:19,339
I did not make myself King.

1409
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:23,260
God did.

1410
02:23:24,345 --> 02:23:26,346
King by divine right.

1411
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:30,893
Now you come to me with this document

1412
02:23:32,437 --> 02:23:36,189
Seeking to limit the authority given to me by god!

1413
02:23:36,274 --> 02:23:38,775
Sire, you gave your word!

1414
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,027
No.

1415
02:23:40,111 --> 02:23:42,112
Sire, you give us our word, Sire!

1416
02:23:42,196 --> 02:23:44,114
Did I command you to speak, Sir?

1417
02:23:44,198 --> 02:23:45,198
- John...

1418
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:46,533
- Or you, Madam?

1419
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:48,368
Sire, we looked to you!

1420
02:23:48,786 --> 02:23:51,705
Look to your estates, instead.

1421
02:23:55,043 --> 02:23:56,335
Archers!

1422
02:23:57,045 --> 02:24:00,213
You are fortunate that I am in a merciful mood.

1423
02:24:01,382 --> 02:24:05,761
But as for Robin Longstride,

1424
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:11,266
for the crimes of theft and incitement to cause unrest,

1425
02:24:11,351 --> 02:24:13,677
who pretended to be a knight of the realm,

1426
02:24:13,678 --> 02:24:15,228
a crime punishable by death,

1427
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:20,651
I declare him, from this day forth,

1428
02:24:22,570 --> 02:24:26,198
To be hunted all the days of his life...

1429
02:24:26,282 --> 02:24:28,116
We will not stand for this!

1430
02:24:28,201 --> 02:24:30,327
...until his corpse, unburied, is carrion

1431
02:24:30,411 --> 02:24:33,121
for foxes and crows!

1432
02:24:56,187 --> 02:24:57,980
Hear me! Hear me!

1433
02:25:01,109 --> 02:25:02,818
By royal decree,

1434
02:25:03,403 --> 02:25:06,738
Robin Longstride, also known as Robin of the Hood,

1435
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:10,283
and all who shelter him or aid him

1436
02:25:10,368 --> 02:25:12,035
are declared outlaws of the realm,

1437
02:25:13,287 --> 02:25:14,871
their properties forfeit,

1438
02:25:14,956 --> 02:25:19,126
and their lives shall be taken by

1439
02:25:25,091 --> 02:25:27,801
A nail please? And a hammer.

1440
02:25:28,511 --> 02:25:29,594
A nail!

1441
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,023
Off you go. Come on.

1442
02:26:23,941 --> 02:26:25,108
Hey, boys.

1443
02:26:25,193 --> 02:26:27,110
- You've been practising tying your knots?
- Yes.

1444
02:26:27,195 --> 02:26:29,029
Have you been shooting your bow and arrows?

1445
02:26:29,113 --> 02:26:30,697
Who hit something? Anyone?

1446
02:26:30,782 --> 02:26:33,617
The greenwood is the outlaw's friend.

1447
02:26:33,701 --> 02:26:36,453
Now, the orphan boys make us welcome.

1448
02:26:37,371 --> 02:26:38,747
No tax, no tithe.

1449
02:26:38,831 --> 02:26:43,251
Nobody rich, nobody poor.

1450
02:26:43,544 --> 02:26:47,714
Many wrongs to be righted in the country of King John.

1451
02:26:51,052 --> 02:26:53,220
Watch over us, Walter.

1452
02:29:52,692 --> 02:29:54,192
For the Lion Heart!
