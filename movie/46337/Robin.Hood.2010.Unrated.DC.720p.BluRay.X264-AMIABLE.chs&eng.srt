1
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,814
谁能告诉我发生了什么事情
Can somebody tell me what's going on?

2
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,690
别傻了  沃尔特  让他回去睡觉
Don't be foolish, Walter. Get him back to bed.

3
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,400
-把门锁上  -我还是这房子的主人
- Bar the door.  - I'm still the master of this house.

4
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,902
查理  起来
Richard, up.

5
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,073
谁在那儿
Who is there?

6
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,741
醒醒  汤姆斯
Wake up, Thomas.

7
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,915
开门
Open the gates!

8
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,926
混蛋

12
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,781
我看到你们了

13
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,296
窃贼蛆
Thieving maggots.

14
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,173
他们偷走了我们所有的谷物种子
They've taken all our seed grain.

15
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,552
我们拿什么来种地
What are we going to do for planting?

16
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,470
祈祷吧
Pray.

17
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,745
你们好
Hello, there!

19
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,386
罗宾
Robin.

20
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,762
弓箭手被命令集合
The archers been called to ranks.

21
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,889
真见鬼的会找时间  老子肚子饿坏了
Bloody typical. I'm starving.

22
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,849
把这些藏好了
Hide these well.

23
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,102
我们晚上再吃
We'll have them for supper instead.

24
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
陛下
Sire.

25
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,123
水准备好了  陛下
Your bath, Sire.

26
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,042
看在上帝的份上  洛克斯利  
For the love of Christ, Loxley,

27
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,646
你能让他们停下吗
would you stop them doing that!

28
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,273
他们这样是出于对您的敬爱  陛下
They love you, Sire.

29
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,942
我的头  嗡嗡的吵死了
My head. It's going like the bells of hell.

30
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,988
就是那个吗
Is that it?

31
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,451
再拿下这个城堡  我们就可以荣归故里了
One more castle to sack, then we're home to England.

32
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,871
查理国王万岁
Hail King Richard!

33
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,335
放箭

34
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,673
推

35
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,259
弓箭手
Hey, archer!

36
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,886
别丢了小命
Stay alive!

37
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,179
晚上见
I'll see you tonight.

38
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,306
这次别忘了带钱  小伙子
Don't forget your money this time, little man.

39
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,558
我很乐于把它从你手上赢过来
It will be my pleasure to take it off you.

40
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,394
推
Push!

41
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,317
冲上去
Move up!

42
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,949
掩护国王  掩护国王
Cover the King! Cover the King!

43
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,955
盾牌准备
Barricades prepare!

44
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,799
让我们干掉这些法国佬
Let us put these French to bed!

45
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,306
翻起盾牌
Raise the barricades!

46
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,487
吉米
Jimmy.

47
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,822
沉着小心  别浪费机会
Calm and careful. Make it count.

48
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,157
出击
Go!

49
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,014
救命啊
Help!

50
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,559
掩护
Cover!

51
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,780
现在跳
Now.

52
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,243
跑
Go!

53
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,878
回撤
Move back!

54
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,048
血染法国
Blood for France!

55
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,884
出击
Go!

56
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,221
马上就要被射成刺猬了
It'll make a fine pin cushion!

57
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,348
菲利普国王去死吧
King Philip's arse!

58
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:56,243
狮心王所向披靡
Look what they do for the Lion Heart!

59
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,247
推
Push!

60
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,665
推
Push!

61
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,336
这会烧整个晚上  伙计们   别让他们给扑灭了
That'll burn all night, lads.  Don't let them put it out.

62
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,176
我们冲锋陷阵  最后论功赏的却是这些
These pricks will smash through in the morning,

63
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:08,881
第二天早上才轻轻松松冲进去的混球
take all the credit.

64
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,507
干的好  小吉米
Well done, Jimmy boy.

65
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,821
约翰...
John...

66
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,365
女王陛下
Your Majesty.

67
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,035
英国公主因为一个法国小妞
An English Princess shut out of her husband's bedchamber

68
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,245
被其丈夫拒之门外
by a piece of French pastry!

69
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,872
你不觉得羞愧吗
Aren't you ashamed?

70
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,791
该羞愧的是他
The shame is surely his.

71
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,876
那就进去告诉他
Then go in and tell him.

72
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,588
在他门前像孩子一样哭泣一点都不管用
Mewling at his keyhole is neither one thing nor the other.

73
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,799
约翰
John.

74
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,972
上帝  怎么回事...
Oh, God! What in heaven...

75
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,266
小姐  抱歉  
Mademoiselle, you will excuse me.

76
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,394
我的儿子需要我的建议
My son has need of my advice.

77
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,270
不  我不需要  不信你问她
No, I don't. Ask her.

78
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,066
母后  拜托  你不觉得这不合适吗
Mother, please, have you no decency?

79
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,513
我刚好在干  
I happen to be in a condition

80
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,737
任何母亲都不应该看的事情
that no mother should see her son in.

81
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,284
我也不想  但那是我母后  
- Yes, I know, but it's my mother.

82
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,411
够了
- That's enough.

83
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,912
再想想  
On second thoughts,

84
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,207
我觉得你最好还是听我要说的话
 I think it better that  you do hear what I have to say.

85
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,127
但我不想让你出现在我的眼前
Though I will not have you in my presence.

86
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,837
母后
Mother.

87
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,799
我出现在这里的目的是从这不适当的娱乐中  
The purpose of my being in this room is to save the realm

88
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,970
拯救这个王国
from the consequences of this unsuitable amusement.

89
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,764
她叔叔就是那见鬼的法国国王
Her uncle is the bloody King of France.

90
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,892
-我叔叔是...  -没你说话的份
- My uncle is... - Get down.

91
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,645
她叔叔想让她回去
Her uncle wants her back.

92
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,399
菲利普正需要一个
Philip wants an excuse

93
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,570
出兵越过海峡的借口
to cross the channel with an army.

94
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,239
你却给了他那个理由
And you have given him that excuse.

95
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,160
回到你法定妻子的身边  拯救英格兰
Take up your lawful wife and save England.

96
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,913
我的法定妻子木得像块砖
My lawful wife is as barren as a brick.

97
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,958
你真的想让我有那样的妻子吗
Is that truly the wife you want for me?

98
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,921
您以八个子女让您的丈夫荣耀
You, who honoured your husband with eight children

99
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,549
即使现在  当其他的子女都已逝去
so that even now when death has taken the rest

100
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:20,596
您还有一个国王和一个叫您母后的傀儡
You have a King and the runt of the litter to call you "mother".

101
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,348
我宁愿你找侍女生私生子
Better the bastard of a servant girl

102
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,976
也好过和嫉妒英格兰的敌人的侄女上床
than bed the niece of England's jealous enemy.

103
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,645
我要和她上床并且娶她  母后
Or bed her and wed her, mother.

104
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,356
我已经让教皇的人准备好废黜事宜了
I've asked the Pope's men to arrange an annulment.

105
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,192
你认为教皇
And do you think the Pope

106
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,862
相比法国国王会更喜欢英国傀儡吗
will favour England's royal runt over the King of France?

107
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,073
他也许就是这样认为的  因为我是亚奎丹的埃莉诺的儿子
He might see his way for the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

108
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,534
同时也是英格兰未来的国王
And for the future King of England.

109
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,413
狮心王查理已经至少四十了  甚至更老
Richard the Lion Heart is 40-years-old, if not more.

110
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,208
没有子嗣
And no babies.

111
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,503
我是未来的皇后
I am a queen in the maKing.

112
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,507
对  没错
Yes. Yes.

113
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,426
看到了吗
You see?

114
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,930
她是我的埃莉诺
She is my Eleanor.

115
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,561
现在明白了吗  这游戏不靠运气
Now, you do understand, this game is not about luck.

116
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,564
靠的是记忆力和手法
It's about the science of memory and a quick hand.

117
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,358
谁想带点鲜肉回家
Who'd like to take a bit of fresh meat home?

118
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,527
我们今早还捕了一只野鸡
Caught this morning. We have a pheasant.

119
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,112
三选一  右边  左边  还是中间
Three choices. Right, left or middle?

120
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,280
中间
Middle.

121
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,783
"中间"  他说选中间
"The middle," he says. The middle.

122
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,870
抱歉那些洋葱归我了  伙计  你输了
I'm sorry about those onions, young man. You lose.

123
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,539
罗宾  扔过来  我这儿正好要洋葱调味
Robin! Over here, they're needed for the pot.

124
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,040
绝对新鲜
Feisty one!

125
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,669
还有什么  还有什么
Aye, what else we got, what else we got?

126
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,379
火会完成它的使命
The fire will do its work.

127
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,048
我们天一亮就进攻
We break through at first light.

128
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,802
不出意外  我们三天之后就可以到家了
With a fair wind, we can be home in three days.

129
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,304
你要回诺丁汉吗
You return to Nottingham?

130
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,183
我有妻子在那儿等着我
I have a wife who waits for me.

131
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,145
我有个老不死的母后
I have a mother that won't die

132
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,898
还有个巴不得我早死的弟弟
and a brother who wishes me dead.

133
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,568
我回去的第一件事就是把他们关起来
First thing I'm going to do is lock them up.

134
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,362
你的人民会很高兴看到你归来
Your people will rejoice to see you return home.

135
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,031
那也是我希望保持的现象
And that is a condition I would like to keep them in.

136
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,158
和以前一样被历史铭记
To be remembered as I was.

137
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,328
我的军队更了解
My army knows better.

138
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,417
狮心是污秽的
Lion Heart is mangy.

139
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,130
军队里的每个人都敬仰您  陛下
Every man in that army idolises you, your Majesty.

140
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,007
别拍我马屁
Don't mollycoddle me.

141
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,678
我知道和国王做朋友有多难
I understand how difficult it must be to be friend a King.

142
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,308
好了  洛克斯利  让我们找点乐子  开怀畅饮一下
Come on, Loxley. Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.

143
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,894
看看能不能找到一个诚实的人
Let us see if we can find an honest man.

144
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,104
好
Yes.

145
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,189
就这样
Let's do that.

146
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,120
伙计  事实是   这游戏不靠运气
Well, that's the thing, little man. This is not a game of luck.

147
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,582
靠的是记忆力和手法
It's about the science of memory and a quick hand.

148
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,544
我有火眼金睛   我会牢牢盯着你的
I've got a quick eye. I'll be watching you.

149
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,642
三选一
Three choices.

150
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,061
右边  左边  还是中间
Right, left, or middle.

151
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,981
我想我要选第四个
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

152
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,942
第四个吗
A fourth?

153
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,112
我看了你很久了  朗斯特莱德
I've been watching you for a while now, Longstride.

154
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,531
这里根本没有豌豆
There is no pea.

155
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,951
这是个骗人的把戏
This game is a trick!

156
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,276
你换碗的时候
You take out the pea

157
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:34,164
就把豌豆拿出去了
when you're doing your slidings and your turnings.

158
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,582
我识破你的伎俩了
I got you.

159
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,547
别再碰它
Don't touch it again.

160
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,800
我来
I'll do it!

161
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,114
你输了
You lose.

162
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,718
你其实干得挺不错的
You're doing better than you think.

163
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,553
过这儿来  罗宾
Get in there, Robin.

164
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,732
跪下  你们这些无知的混蛋
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

165
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,650
在国王面前跪下
Kneel before the King!

166
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,863
你们都退回去  快
All of you, move back, now.

167
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,033
不  不  洛克斯利   这些士兵只是在玩儿
No, no, Loxley. These men are soldiers at play.

168
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,327
怪罪他们我就成了罪人了
Sinners after mine own heart.

169
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,664
你们谁先挑起的
Which one of you started the fight?

170
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,334
是我  陛下
I did, Sire.

171
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,045
我挥的第一拳
I threw the first punch.

172
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,214
诚实的人
Ah, honest man.

173
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,508
你跟谁打
And who're you fighting?

174
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,596
他在跟我打  陛下
He was fighting me, your Majesty.

175
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,848
我认为他是个骗子
I thought him to be a lesser man.

176
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,350
但他证明了他不是
He was showing me different.

177
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,396
一个向对手表示尊敬的敌人
An enemy that shows his respect.

178
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,274
你们平身
Stand up, the pair of you.

179
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,609
不是你们
Not you.

180
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,200
勇敢  诚实
Brave and honest.

181
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,872
但你会足够诚实到告诉一个国王
Are you honest enough to tell a King

182
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,331
他不愿意听的事情吗
something that he does not want to hear?

183
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,209
你对我的东征有何看法
What is your opinion on my crusade?

184
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,839
神会喜欢我的献祭吗
Will god be pleased with my sacrifice?

185
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,767
不  他不会
No, he won't.

186
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,354
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

187
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,273
阿卡里的大屠杀  陛下
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

188
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,567
大声点
Speak up!

189
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,040
当您命令我们把两千五百穆斯林
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim

190
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,990
男女和儿童赶到一起
men, women, and children together,

191
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,315
在我脚边  手被绑着的那位女士  
the young woman at my feet, with her hands bound,

192
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:18,370
抬头看着我
she looked up at me.

193
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,415
她眼神里没有恐惧  没有怒气
There wasn't fear in her eyes. There wasn't anger.

194
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,126
只有怜悯
There was only pity.

195
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,507
因为她知道当您下令
For she knew that when you gave the order

196
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,594
我们砍下他们的头颅那刻起
and our blades would descend upon their heads,

197
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,806
我们就失去了神的护佑
that, in that moment, we would be godless.

198
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,933
我们所有人
All of us.

199
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,562
都会失去神的护佑
Godless.

200
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,401
诚实
Honest,

201
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,778
勇敢
brave

202
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,743
这就是英格兰子民
There is your Englishman.

203
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,204
就在这儿
Right there.

204
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,959
-干的好  罗宾  -你告诉他了
- Well done, Robin.  - You showed him.

205
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,961
最坏就是挨鞭刑了
The whipping will be the worst of it.

206
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,379
烙铁  那才是最坏的
The branding iron, that will be the worst.

207
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,672
除非他们用绞刑
Unless they hang us.

208
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,300
不  这才是最坏的
No. No, this will be the worst of it.

209
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,552
这也代表着结束  
And this will be the end of it.

210
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,721
一旦从这儿逃出来  我立马走人
As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.

211
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,017
我不欠上帝或者这里的任何其他人哪怕是一分一秒的服役  
I don't owe God or any other man here one more minute of service.

212
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,872
我们是同一个妈喂大的
We go all the way back to the same breast.

213
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,376
奶妈吗
Wet nurse.

214
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,669
是的
Indeed.

215
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,588
我们一直以来都很亲密
We've been close ever since.

216
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,883
很好
Good.

217
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,514
因为英格兰在你朋友约翰的统治下
Because England, under your friend John,

218
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,601
是个失去了战斗灵魂的国度
is a country with no fighting spirit.

219
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,063
我用一队厨子就能轻取伦敦
I can take London with an army of cooks.

220
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,191
但是查理正在归乡途中
But Richard is on his way home.

221
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,071
在他的统治下  英格兰会山河日下
And under Richard,  England is a different animal altogether.

222
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,200
查理班师回朝会经过布罗塞利昂德森林
Richard will return home through the forest of Broceliande.

223
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,286
我们知道准确的地点
We know the exact place.

224
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,866
他总是走在军队的前面
He always travels ahead of his army

225
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,751
只有一些被信赖的骑士跟着他
with only a few trusted knights around him.

226
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,546
如果查理死了
With Richard dead,

227
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,257
你很容易就可以策反贵族  抵抗约翰的统治
it will be easy for you to turn the country against John.

228
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,427
没有比这更好的入侵机会了
There'll never be a better moment to invade.

229
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,475
但百足之虫  死而不僵
Even dying animals can be obstinate.

230
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,481
杀了狮心王  你会被重赏
Kill the Lion Heart and you will be richly rewarded.

231
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,876
撞
Heave!

232
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,879
撞
Heave!

233
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,605
撞
Heave!

234
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,232
为了英格兰
For England!

235
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,363
为了英格兰
For England!

236
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,750
我需要一名医生
I need a physician here!

237
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,794
医生  快点
A physician! Quickly!

238
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,587
掩护我们  掩护我们  快
Give us cover! Give us cover, now!

239
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,008
掩护国王
Cover him!

240
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,511
掩护国王
Cover the King.

241
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,514
医生
Physician!

242
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,141
怎么了  洛克斯利  你不舒服吗
Why, Loxley? Are you not feeling well?

243
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,310
医生
Physician!

244
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,818
酒
Wine.

245
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,300
怎么了
What's this?

246
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,637
-国王死了  -死了
- The King is dead!  - Dead?

247
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,556
死了
Dead.

248
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,308
那么吉米  把钉子敲出去
All right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.

249
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,561
现在我们自己掌控命运
We make our own fate from now on!

250
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,482
我跟你一块
I'll come with you.

251
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,485
不  你不行  我们不收流浪狗
No, you're not. We don't take strays.

252
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,570
人越多越好
The more the merrier.

253
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,572
路上很危险  他可能会有用
The road will be dangerous. He might be useful.

254
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,656
我们去哪
Where we going?

255
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,526
我们要赶在三千绝望的士兵之前  
To the coast and to a boat

256
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,368
到达岸边  找到船只
before 3,000 desperate soldiers get there

257
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,829
渡过海峡的价格很快会上涨一百倍
and the price for a channel crossing goes up a hundredfold.

258
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,289
我们的军饷怎么办
What about our wages?

259
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,417
如果你觉得他活着的时候就已经很难获得军饷
If you thought it was hard getting wages while he was alive,

260
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,335
试试去让死去的国王付你钱
try getting paid by a dead King.

261
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,672
好了  伙计们  迅速收拾行李
All right, boys, collect your gear as quick as you can.

262
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,263
我喜欢这个新教堂
I like the new church.

263
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,684
马里昂夫人
Lady Marion.

264
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,395
你没来送行的话
I would have been sorry

265
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,106
我会很遗憾的  谢谢
to leave without your farewell. Thank you.

266
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,568
很乐意为您践行  坦克雷德神父
I'm glad to speed you on your way, Father Tancred,

267
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,030
但我来是为了找我们的新牧师
but it was to seek out our new shepherd.

268
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,576
您最近都没来参加我的周日礼拜和传教
You have lately been missed at Sunday worship and my sermons.

269
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,289
当我祈祷奇迹的时候  我喜欢安静的教堂  神父
I like a quiet church, Father, when I pray for a miracle.

270
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,634
您的受众是妇女  儿童和老人
Your new flock is women, children and old folk.

271
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,886
我们的男人在浴血奋战  或受伤归来
Our men have gone to war or returned broken.

272
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,056
他们的孤儿在绿林中撒野
Their orphans run wild in the greenwood.

273
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,896
我们土地已经可以播种了  但我们没有种子
Our fields are ready for planting but we've no seed corn.

274
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,066
而教堂的粮仓谷物丰硕
And the church barn is full of grain.

275
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,777
你不会是在期待教堂把它的谷物
Surely, you do not expect the church

276
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,780
种在你们的土地上吧
to let its corn be used to plant your fields?

277
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,658
这些粮食是约克的
That grain is bound for York.

278
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,494
我是修道士塔克
I am Friar Tuck.

279
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,038
坦克雷德神父被升迁到约克
Father Tancred is elevated to York

280
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,615
我想他到那儿会提醒主教
where I know he will remind the bishop

281
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:19,874
诺丁汉的人民...
that the people of Nottingham...

282
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,753
主教不需要提醒诺丁汉的人民
The bishop does not need reminding that the people of Nottingham

283
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,882
恶有恶报  忏悔种孽
should reap what they sow and repent of their sins.

284
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,147
我祈祷的奇迹是
The miracle I pray for is that

285
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:32,178
主教展现一些基督教的仁慈
the bishop show some christian charity.

286
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,352
我说过  神父  我喜欢在安静的教堂祈祷
As I said, Father, I like a quiet church when I pray.

287
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,539
佩珀哈罗的洛克斯利家族会找你麻烦的
You will have trouble from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

288
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,712
塔克  你养蜂吗
You keep bees, Tuck?

289
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,006
我养蜂  蜂为我服务
I keep them and they keep me.

290
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,532
停下
Stop!

291
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,160
有埋伏
Ambush!

292
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,072
你是个骑士吗
You're a knight?

293
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,866
查理国王在哪里
Where is King Richard?

294
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,785
我的天啊
Oh, God.

295
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,328
国王在哪儿
Where is the King?

296
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,039
-死了  -他死了
- Dead. - Dead?

297
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,500
真的吗
Really?

298
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,839
如果国王已死  你们这是前往何处
If the King's dead, where are you going?

299
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,508
护送王冠
Deliver the crown.

300
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,680
查理的王冠
Richard's crown.

301
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,644
查理的王冠
Richard's crown.

302
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,239
我们怎么去暗杀一个死掉的国王
How do we assassinate a King who's already dead?

303
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,494
把王冠追回来  把马杀死
Bring back the crown! Kill the horse!

304
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,205
你是英国人
You are English.

305
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,167
这么说也行
When it suits me.

306
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,670
你是谁
Who are you?

307
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,522
罗伯特・洛克斯利
Robert Loxley.

308
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,401
那是国王的马
That's the King's horse.

309
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,408
吉米  闪开
Jimmy! Move!

310
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,920
吉米
Jimmy!

311
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,643
罗宾  他们是法国人
Robin, they're French.

312
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,894
一定是个埋伏
Ambush.

313
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,580
冲啊
Go.

314
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,577
约翰  什么情况
John.

315
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,080
不知道
Don't know.

316
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,581
他死了
He's dead.

317
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,874
救命
Help.

318
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,884
请把剑给我
My sword.

319
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,188
这剑对我意义重大
Its value to me is great.

320
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,442
原本是我父亲的剑
It belonged to my father,

321
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,861
他是诺丁汉的
Sir Walter Loxley

322
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,613
沃尔特・洛克斯利爵士
of Nottingham.

323
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,908
你听说过吗
Do you know it?

324
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,786
是的  我听说过诺丁汉
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

325
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,875
感谢老天
Then the fate...

326
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,085
感谢上苍眷顾
The fates have smiled on me.

327
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,843
请你务必将剑交到我父亲手中
You must take the sword to my father.

328
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,971
这会让我安息
It will bring me peace.

329
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,936
我当年盛怒之下  未经他允许带离此剑
I took it in anger and without his consent.

330
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,483
你一定懂得
You must understand the bond of love

331
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,777
这种父子间的羁绊
between a father and his son.

332
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,327
我父亲在我六岁时
My father abandoned me to the world of men

333
00:31:05,328 --> 00:31:07,239
就把我遗弃了
when I was six years old.

334
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,950
我对父子之情不甚了解
I know little of the love between father and son.

335
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,535
我请求你 
I beg you.

336
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,871
朗斯特莱德  
Longstride,

337
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,414
答应我
say you will.

338
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,837
我答应你
I will.

339
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,735
你以血起誓了  罗宾
It's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.

340
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,572
埃伦  只不过是划伤罢了  仅此而已
It's a scratch, Allan, and that's all it is.

341
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,052
罗宾
Robin!

342
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,271
洛克斯利原本要去海边和舰队会和 
Loxley was making for the coast to meet the ship.

343
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,901
王冠可以让我们顺利回家
That crown could be our passage home.

344
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,820
罗宾  我们只是普通的弓箭手
We're common archers, Robin.

345
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,731
如果带着王冠出现在国王的船上
If we arrive at the King's ship with his crown,

346
00:32:29,732 --> 00:32:30,781
我们会被告谋杀
we'll be accused of murder.

347
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,033
你怎么肯定
How do you know

348
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,159
看到的那些骑士
that the knights you see walking

349
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,329
就一定是真的骑士呢
about are actually knights at all?

350
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,874
区分骑士和平民的唯一标志
There is no difference between a knight

351
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,043
就是着装
and any other man aside from what he wears.

352
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,130
我们乔装打扮即可
All we need is about us.

353
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,967
找来甲胄  头盔  剑
Armour, helmets, swords,

354
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,431
我们就可以伪装成骑宝马  带金子上路的
and we make England wealthy men

355
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,268
英格兰富人
with horses and gold.

356
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,397
命运终于垂青我们了
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

357
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,067
而我  绝不会放弃这大好良机
And I, for one, shall not turn my back on her.

358
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,780
把王冠摘下来  威尔
Take that crown off your head, Will,

359
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,948
装满金银财宝更有用些
And fill it to the brim.

360
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,372
主啊  我们将此人的灵魂交给您保管
We commit the soul of this boy to your keeping, Lord.

361
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,043
当他到达永生之门时  我们请求
We would ask, when he arrives at the gates of eternity,

362
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,711
您能让他得以永生
if you could let him in.

363
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,729
歌利亚把地犁得很好  但种什么呢
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely. But for what?

364
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,356
荨麻吗  
- Nettles?

365
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,982
荨麻汤和蒲公英沙拉
- Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

366
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,150
我们至少可以活命
that'll keep us alive.

367
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,318
歌利亚  这边来
Come, Goliath. this way.

368
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,028
直到奇迹出现
Until we get a miracle.

369
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,072
这边
This way.

370
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,789
马里昂  郡督来了
Marion, Sheriff.

371
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,259
马里昂  我在佩珀哈罗始终没有得到
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow, waiting in vain

372
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,803
沃尔特爵士的接见
for Sir Walter to receive me.

373
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,316
烦请转告  我有别的事忙
Kindly tell him I have better things to do

374
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:20,724
不能在府上久候
than haunt his threshold.

375
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,519
舍伍德盗贼横行的时候  你倒是悠哉悠哉
That you have, while robbers are roaming free in Sherwood.

376
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,854
那是郡督的职责  你怎么不操心
That's Sheriff's business. Why don't you look to it?

377
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,148
告诉那个老家伙  下次我会破门而入
Tell the old fool that next time, I'll break his door down.

378
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,858
而且如果他太骄傲而不付...  
And if he's too proud to pay...

379
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,944
不  他不是太骄傲
No, no, no, no. He's not too proud.

380
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,529
他是太穷了
He's too poor.

381
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,990
以查理国王之名  你们搜刮民脂  
In the name of King Richard, you have stripped our wealth

382
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,449
只顾出外征战
to pay for foreign adventures.

383
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,244
而在地方上还有教堂  以仁慈的上帝之名
Whilst at home, the church, in the name of the merciful god,

384
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,453
毫不留情地掠夺
has reaped, without mercy,

385
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,790
我们赖以糊口的存粮
the largest share of what we had set aside to feed ourselves.

386
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,377
我已经无从分辨  郡督和主教之间  
Between a Sheriff and a Bishop, I wouldn't care to judge

387
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,671
到底谁压榨老实的英国人更多
who's the greater curse on honest English folk.

388
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,049
马里昂
Marion,

389
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,136
当你有办法能让我成为你的保护者的时候
Why,why do you make an enemy of me

390
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,388
为什么还要选择与我为敌
when you have the means to make me your protector?

391
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,140
你指什么办法
What means?

392
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,730
如果你现在就滚
If you leave now,

393
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,316
你还能活得长久些  等我丈夫回来时  
I will lengthen your life by not telling my husband

394
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,943
我不会把你来骚扰的事告诉他
of your visit when he returns home.

395
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,946
你丈夫  都十年没回来了
Your husband? After 10 years?

396
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,523
如果他还没死
If he's not dead,

397
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:21,493
那一定是在北非海岸的温柔乡  乐不思蜀了
He's rutting his way through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

398
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,038
只有你这种下流胚才会这样
So speaks a man of experience.

399
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,956
好好想想吧  马里昂
Well, think on it, Marion.

400
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,917
沃尔特爵士后继无人
Sir Walter is dying without an heir.

401
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,875
他死后佩珀哈罗将归由国王所有
Peper Harow will fall to the crown,

402
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:32,963
到时你就睡大街吧
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

403
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,007
你会后悔没来从我的
You'll be glad to come to me then.

404
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,876
船长  看那里
Captain, there.

405
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,941
先生  应是12名骑士和国王一同登船
Sir, we were told to expect 12 riders and the King.

406
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,944
我们爱戴的国君已经去世
Our beloved King is dead.

407
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,157
吾王永恒
Long live the King.

408
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,784
请问阁下是
And you are, Sir?

409
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:49,915
诺丁汉罗伯特・洛克斯利爵士  你是
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham. And you?

410
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,501
我是国王侍从
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

411
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,202
先生们  上船吧  
Come aboard, gentlemen, before

412
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:55,963
马上要涨潮了
the tide floats her. It's coming in fast.

413
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:11,937
划船啊  壮士们  在赶路  壮士们
And it's row, me bully boys we're in a hurry, boys.

414
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,232
长路漫漫
We got a long way to go

415
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:19,236
我们载歌载舞  告别法国
where we'll sing and we'll dance and bid farewell to France.

416
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,282
划船啊  壮士们  划船啊
And row, me bully boys, row.

417
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:28,328
划船啊  壮士们  在赶路  壮士们
And it's row, me bully boys we're in a hurry boys.

418

如果王太后或者别的什么皇亲国戚
What if... what if Loxley is known

442
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,435

但他无法留下遗言

534
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,225
因为上帝扼住他的喉咙

535
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,938
上帝用弩扼住他的喉咙

536
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,441
老天  你就不能唱点喜庆的歌啊
By Christ! Can you not sing a happy tune?

I'll climb up to your chamber and under your mountainous...

542
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,505

Right. I'm done. The money's divided.

543
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,841
我们也该分道扬镳了
And so should we be.

544
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,384
你要去哪里
Where will you go?

545
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,265
这笔钱财我拿得不心安
I think something is owed for this good fortune,

546
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,850
我要设法补偿

怎么补偿
How so?

548
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,772
剑上的铭文  在我脑中挥之不去 
The inscription on the sword, it taunts my memory.

549
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,568
或许只是我的想象  我不知道
Maybe it's just my imagination, I don't know.

550
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:52,113
但我打算将剑带回它的主人身边
But I intend to take that sword back to its owner

551
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,948
完成他儿子临死前的请求
...and fulfil the request of his dying son.

552
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,200
你是不是疯了
Are you mad?

553
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,785
罗宾  你刚说过我们身处险境
You just said we were in danger, Robin.

554
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,830
你现在却决定折回  以身犯险吗
Now you choose to step back in to harm's way?

555
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,833
他们一定会在那里设下陷阱等你
They're bound to go there and find you.

556
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:08,004
我们不能出尔反尔  这会招来厄运
We can't repay our good luck with bad grace. It invites darkness.

557
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,719
-我和你一起去  -还有我  罗宾
- I'm going with you. - And I, Robin.

558
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,387
-没错  -不行
- Yes. - No.

559
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,766
今晚是我们最后一次相聚
Tonight is our last in company.

560
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,810
明天  我们分道扬镳
Tomorrow, we go our separate ways.

561
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,357
拿好自己那份钱  吃饭睡觉
Pack up your share. We eat and sleep.

562
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,443
威尔  你值第一轮班
Will, you're on first watch.

563
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,673
威尔
Will.

564
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,663
小心点
Watch your step!

565
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,665
有一个跑了
One of them got away.

566
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,753
混蛋  他们偷了我的钱
Bastards! They've stolen my fortune.

567
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,506
查理的军队在回家的路上
Richard's army is coming home.

568
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,383
维持军队需要经费  
It costs money to keep it together.

569
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,760
马歇尔  经费一向由你负责
Marshal, you speak for the money.

570
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,011
是的  陛下
I do, Sire.

571
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,556
但遣散军队比维持花费更大
But to disband the army could cost more than to keep it.

572
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,189
查理国王的征伐耗资巨大  但战争获利却
King Richard's campaigns were costly.

573
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,524
马歇尔  那和我有什么关系
What is that to me, Marshal?

574
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,819
我哥哥的烂摊子我才不管
My brother's troubles are over!

575
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,697
都结束了
They're over!

576
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:42,992
你们都退下
Clear the room.

577
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,757
那...只能增加税收了
So... taxation.

578
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,008
增加税收
Taxation?

579
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,355
无止尽的挤奶只会让奶牛
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing but

580
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:03,429
把你从挤奶凳上踢下来
kicked off the milking stool.

581
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,640
母后  少用你那小农思想折磨我
Mother, spare me your farmyard memories.

582
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,392
你没当过农民  我也搞不懂他们
You have none, and I don't understand them.

583
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,228
现在形势不稳定
These are difficult times.

584
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,146
但我们可以争取时间
We can buy time.

585
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,899
我可以派特使去贷款
I can send envoys to secure loans.

586
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,481
从西西里到诺曼底
There are money chests from Sicily to

587
00:53:16,482 --> 00:53:17,860
遍布财富只要你知道在哪
Normandy if you know where to look.

588
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,029
卑躬屈膝的去找高利贷吗
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

589
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,906
你的主人可是国王
Your master's a King.

590
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,951
国内所有人欠国家的钱
The crown is owed money at home.

591
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,087
北方贵族借口贫穷不愿交税
The northern Barons plead poverty,

592
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,247
不过喜欢装穷的总是那些富人
but that's always been the song of rich men.

593
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,166
那么下一步怎么做
So, what's to be done?

594
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,018
给我点时间陛下  我要带着骑兵北征
Give me leave, Sire, to go north with a company of mounted men.

595
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,896
我会让那些商人和地主乖乖交钱
I'll have the merchants and landowners fill your coffers.

596
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,982
不然就送他们进坟墓
Or their coffins.

597
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,484
你这是让英格兰人自相残杀
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

598
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,612
忠于国王的人都无所畏惧
No man loyal to the crown has anything to fear.

599
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:07,201
忠诚也同时意味着你要向国家缴税
And loyalty means paying your share in the defence of the realm.

600
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,912
说的好
That's well said.

601
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,498
马歇尔  你觉得呢
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

602
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,168
母后
Mother?

603
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:20,339
查理以身作则博取忠诚而不是威逼恐吓
Richard commanded loyalty not by threats but by example.

604
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,593
母后  你那圣子是个低能儿
Mother, your sainted son was an imbecile.

605
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,530
从这儿到耶路撒冷来来回回
And you supported his every folly

606
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:29,015
他每次犯蠢你都支持他
from here to Jerusalem and back.

607
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,852
是的  你崇拜他
Yes, you worshipped him.

608
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,814
当战士们丢掉了父辈打拼来的土地时
When the warrior lost territories hard won by his father.

609
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,108
你亲吻他的照片
You kissed his picture.

610
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,445
英格兰甚至不得不付四年的税款
While England had to pay four years' revenue

611
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,197
赎回被敌军俘虏的他
to ransom him when he was captured.

612
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,782
你跟所有人一样都该受到谴责
You are just as much to blame as anyone,

613
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,243
因为你们毁了我的遗产
for the wreckage which is my inheritance.

614
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,968
她刚才比我更丢脸
I broke her skin more than she did mine.

615
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,894
大法官
Chancellor.

616
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,360
马歇尔
Marshal,

617
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,782
你先后忠诚地服侍了我的父亲和我哥哥
you served my brother faithfully and my father before him.

618
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,203
我觉得你待在我家族身边的时间已经够长了
I think you've spent enough time with my family.

619
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,872
毋须质疑  你一定也想享受下天伦之乐吧
And, no doubt, would like to spend more with your own.

620
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,252
所以  我很遗憾地接受你的请辞
Therefore, and with regret,

621
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,473
你可以离开办公室
I accept your resignation of

622
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,214
放下一切国家事务了
all your offices and matters of state.

623
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,885
交出戒指吧
The ring.

624
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,395
尊敬的陛下
Your Majesty.

625
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,401
戈弗雷  好好斟酌下
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot

626
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:20,209
你想把匕首往哪儿捅
 where you would place your dagger.

627
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,637
因为我也会仔细琢磨这个问题的
For I will choose carefully, as well.

628
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,579
打开城门
Open the gates!

629
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,908
诺丁汉
Nottingham.

630
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,577
罗宾  这些就是你的子民吗  
Is this your people, Robin?

631
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,995
不知道  也许吧
I don't know. Might be.

632
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,832
这些中庸的英格兰人看起来不怎么富有
They don't look much, these middle Englanders.

633
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,230
但是他们把你们养得白白胖胖的  
Well, they've been keeping your lot in place

634
00:57:43,231 --> 00:57:44,543
不是吗
easy enough, haven't they?

635
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,463
我听说你们威尔士小伙子就吃韭菜过活
I hear that you welsh boys, you live on leeks.

636
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,840
跟绵羊一个爱好
You co-habit with sheep.

637
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,095
去你的苏格兰蠢驴
Bloody scottish mule.

638
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,308
你不想惊动蜂窝吧
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive with your noise, would you?

639
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,310
到时候你们的剑可是毫无用处呢  先生们
Your swords would be no good then, gentlemen.

640
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,686
你是镇上的养蜂人吗
You're the town beekeeper?

641
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,774
不  神保佑你  我是修道士塔克
Bless you, no. I'm the Friar. Tuck's the name.

642
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,734
塔克修道士  
Well, Friar Tuck,

643
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,320
能告诉我  沃尔特・洛克斯利爵士住在哪儿吗
can you tell me

644
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,823
他应该在佩珀哈罗
If he's not up at Peper Harow...

645
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,201
你要去多久
How long will your business take?

646
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,332
注意安全
Stay safe.

647
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,334
上帝与你们同在
God be with you all.

648
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,634
就这样吗
That's it?

649
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,177
十年相处就这样结束吗
After 10 years?

650
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,640
善良的修道士  这附近哪儿有能让人
Good Friar, where can a man get, well,

651
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,851
一醉方休的地方
moderately insensible on a drink around here?

652
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,354
埃伦  他是个教士  对不起修道士
Allan, he's a man of the cloth. I'm sorry, Friar.

653
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,023
你有钱吗  
- Have you coin?

654
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,191
我有
- I have coin.

655
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,943
两块
Two pieces.

656
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,862
每个人两块
Each.

657
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,949
尝过我们这里的蜜糖酒吗
Have you tried the honey liquor we call Mead?

658
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,453
跟我来
Come with me.

659
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,372
蜜糖酒能让人有头顶光环的感觉
Gives a man a halo, does Mead.

660
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,155
姑娘
Girl.

661
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,199
喊我姑娘
Girl?

662
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,581
你不是瞎了就是来讨钱的
Either you're going blind or you're looking for charity.

663
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,042
你是这房子的主人吗
Are you the keeper of this house?

664
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,336
某种意义上来说  是的
In a manner of speaking, yes.

665
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,546
我想见沃尔特・洛克斯利爵士
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

666
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,300
你是
And you are?

667
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,635
罗宾・朗斯特莱德
Robin Longstride.

668
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,678
光是罗宾・朗斯特莱德  不用加爵士吗
Plain Robin Longstride? No Sir?

669
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,264
不用  女士  不用加
No, ma'am. No Sir.

670
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,102
你是来收税的吗
Are you here about the tax?

671
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,399
不  我是来把剑带给他的  他儿子牺牲了
No, I'm here to bring him his sword. His son's dead.

672
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,111
跟我来
This way.

673
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,885
他会照看你的马
He'll take your horse.

674
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:52,982
马里昂
Marion!

675
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,942
马里昂
Marion!

676
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,403
玛吉  她去哪儿了
Maggie, where is she?

677
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,239
夫人  沃尔特爵士在找你
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

678
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,700
我知道  玛格利特  我听到了
I know, Margaret. I can hear him.

679
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,244
告诉他来客人了
Tell him we have a guest.

680
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,007
我是马里昂・洛克斯利  罗伯特的妻子
I'm Marion Loxley. Robert's wife.

681
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,097
对不起亲爱的夫人  如果我知道就不会说了
My lady, I owe you an apology. If I'd have known...

682
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,642
坏消息只会是坏消息  早点晚点都一样
Bad news is bad news no matter how it comes.

683
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,084
我反倒该谢谢你
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking the time

684
01:01:32,085 --> 01:01:34,356
亲自把剑送来了
to deliver it here yourself.

685
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,693
你曾经和我丈夫一起战斗吗
Did you fight alongside my husband?

686
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,404
是的
Yes.

687
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,157
他的最后时刻得体吗
Did he die well?

688
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,579
他中埋伏了  夫人
In an ambush, ma'am.

689
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,207
他被选去护送查理的皇冠回国
He was the man chosen to bring home Richard's crown.

690
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,501
马里昂  谁来了
Marion, who is here?

691
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,588
是个过路人  沃尔特
A traveller, Walter.

692
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,638
这消息会让他绝望的
This news will go very hard on him.

693
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,805
带他进来
Bring him in.

694
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,140
知道了  知道了
Yes, yes.

695
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:09,933
告诉他罗伯特在圣地就快回来了
Tell him Robert is in the Holy Land,

696
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,894
托你来报平安的
sends his love and will return soon.

697
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,230
马里昂  我们的旅者一定渴了
Marion, our traveller will be thirsty.

698
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,485
旅者总是渴的  难道不是吗
Travellers are always thirsty. Is that not so?

699
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,611
先生你叫什么名字
Your name, Sir?

700
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,906
朗斯特莱德  罗宾・朗斯特莱德
Longstride. Robin longstride.

701
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,660
你在开我玩笑吗
Do you mock me?

702
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,579
阁下的意思是
Sir?

703
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,123
您的儿子
Your son,

704
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,710
叫我把这个带给你
he asked me to bring you this.

705
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,682
没有剑罗伯特怎么保护自己
And how does Robert defend himself if he has no sword?

706
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,186
这浪子永远不会回来了
The prodigal son will not return after all.

707
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:01,026
没有眼泪  也没有他父亲的原谅
So, no tears, no forgiveness from his father.

708
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,074
做什么都没用了
No amends to be made.

709
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,418
你看到他死的吗
Did you see him die?

710
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,964
他去世的时候我就在旁边
I was with him when he passed.

711
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,465
他念念不忘
His final words were for the l

712
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:25,968
你们父子之间深深的羁绊
ove and bond between a father and son.

713
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,846
请原谅我的无礼
Forgive my rudeness.

714
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,808
我早就准备迎接这悲伤的一天了
My grief has been waiting for this day.

715
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:37,020
过来  让我看看你
So come, so that I may see you.

716
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,496
罗宾・朗斯特莱德
Robin Longstride.

717
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,084
一个寻常却高尚的撒克逊名字
A common enough but noble Saxon name.

718
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,339
和我们一起吃晚饭吧
So, you will dine with us.

719
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,260
但是你得先洗个澡  先生
But first, you must bathe, sir.

720
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,803
你太臭了
You stink.

721
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,937
我这儿还有些我丈夫的衣服
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.

722
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,940
希望你不要嫌弃
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.

723
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,651
尊敬的夫人
My Lady,

724
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,739
我需要有人帮我脱锁子甲
I'll need some help with the chain mail.

725
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:35,120
威妮弗蕾德
Winifred.

726
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,216
威妮弗蕾德
Winifred.

727
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,770
头罩的扣子在我脖颈上
The coif has a clasp at the nape of the neck.

728
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:00,687
脱下头罩后你就能看到大衣后面的结带
If you take off the coif, you'll find lacings in the back of the tabard.

729
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,767
非常感谢
Thank you.

730
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,602
我帮你把它洗了
I'll have it washed.

731
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,705
马里昂  拿点酒来
Marion, more wine.

732
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,629
你不远万里把剑带给了我
You've taken a long road to bring this to me.

733
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:11,091
我不知道这是否意味着我该信任你
I cannot decide whether that makes you trustworthy...

734
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,467
亦或是能从你那寻求帮助
or manipulative.

735
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,721
马里昂
Marion,

736
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,473
我不过是在度量我们客人的品质
I'm merely trying to gauge the quality of the man we have as our guest.

737
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,434
他帅吗
Is he handsome?

738
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,311
帅
Yes.

739
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:27,816
跟没醉酒的农民一样帅
In the way that yeomen sometimes are when they are sober.

740
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,819
先生  说说你的故事吧
Entertain us with a tale of your life, Sir.

741
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,156
我们现在很少有访客了
We don't get many visitors any more.

742
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,992
除了收税的  就是乞丐
Except tax collectors and other beggars.

743
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:41,038
我不知道我从哪儿来  只知道我去过哪里
I don't know where I'm from. Only know where I've been.

744
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:44,499
马里昂  他的眼睛是什么颜色的
So, Marion, what colour are his eyes?

745
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,214
我也还不知道
I don't yet know.

746
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:56,595
年轻人  我有个提议
I have a proposal for you, young man.

747
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:01,266
你给我带来了这把意义非凡的剑
You brought me this sword, which has great meaning.

748
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:03,310
如果你能多待一阵子
If you give me your time,

749
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,687
这把剑就送给你了
it is yours.

750
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,525
我可以再留一天  也许更久
I could stay for a day, or more.

751
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,529
我想问个问题
- I have a question to ask you. -

752
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,865
什么问题
 And what is your question?

753
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,952
剑柄上的文字是什么意思
The words on the hilt of the sword, what do they mean?

754
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,475
我可以给你讲很多历史  
Well, I think I have much to tell you

755
01:07:23,476 --> 01:07:25,832
你的历史
about history, about your history.

756
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,299
谢谢你
That's very kind.

757
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,552
但我的提议还没说完呢
Well, you haven't heard the other half of my proposal yet.

758
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:41,640
我想让你留在诺丁汉假扮我归来的儿子
I want you to stay in Nottingham and, for the time being,

759
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:45,852
也就是马里昂的丈夫
become my returned son, and therefore Marion's spouse.

760
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,187
够了
Oh, that's enough!

761
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,814
-你喝太多了  -听着  听着  听着
- You've had too much to drink. - Listen. Listen. Listen.

762
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,066
我们都知道如果你没有丈夫
We both know that without a husband

763
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,235
我死后这土地就不再属于你
you will lose this land when I die.

764
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,570
你能反驳这点吗
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

765
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,573
不能   当然不能  但如果我说他是我儿子
No.

766
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:04,079
大家都会这么认为  这样你也有了丈夫了
he will be seen as that. And, so as your husband, huh?

767
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,914
这主意不错
It is a fair contract.

768
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:11,128
我并不是想让你们生孩子或有别的什么
It is not as if I expect you to have children or...

769
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:15,215
我只是想用剑换你的一点时间  朗斯特莱德
No, the sword for your time, Longstride.

770
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,591
你同意吗
Are you in agreement?

771
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:19,678
我同意 
- Yes. -Marion, go

772
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,430
马里昂  去告诉所有人
 tell the staff,

773
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:26,017
我儿子回来了  我们全家又团聚了
that my son has arrived and our home is now whole again.

774
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,771
让他们敲响教堂的钟来庆祝
Tell them to ring the church bells in celebration.

775
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,482
再多拿点酒来
And more wine, please.

776
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,578
嘿  嘿
Hey! Hey!

777
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,042
清晨我起来的时候
I rose up in the morning.

778
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,336
强烈的渴望总在心口
And I felt a dire need,

779
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,923
让我醉生梦死混过一天再干一杯蜜糖酒
to dream away the dreary day and down a cup of Mead.

780
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,092
那酒能让我感觉到蜜蜂的叮咬
I felt the sting of honeybees.

781
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,844
家酿的啤酒
Home brew.

782
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,600
如果我不是镇上的牧师我绝对想做酒鬼
If I wasn't the village priest, I'd try for the village drunkard.

783
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:09,853
太迷人了
Oh, great.

784
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,356
男人到了这儿就会变的深情款款
A man could get very affectionate here.

785
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:18,904
我从没在尼姑庵外面见过女多男少的景象
I haven't seen so many women for so few men outside a nunnery.

786
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:24,117
泡妞的秘诀就是别去碰最漂亮的那个
The secret to success is never go for the prettiest one.

787
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,078
从左边相貌平平的那个开始吧
Start with the homely one on the left.

788
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,292
那边那个
Right there.

789
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,754
她是我的菜  我要去逗逗她
She's about my size. I'm going to make her smile.

790
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,132
我要去逗你开心
I'm going to make you smile!

791
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,675
过来吧
Come over here!

792
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,678
他们为什么喊你小约翰
So, why do they call you little John?

793
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,222
你想说什么
What are you trying to get at?

794
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,724
我身体很匀称的
I'm proportionate.

795
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,519
多送几桶酒来吧
So roll another barrel to the bar,

796
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,356
再喝他个一两杯让我的心也醉一下
and pour another cup or two so I can soak my heart.

797
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,614
住嘴
Stop it.

798
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,411
我说什么来着
What did I tell you?

799
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,798
看来我们得同住一个房间了
It seems we are to share my chamber.

800
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,093
这样才能让仆人们相信
A ruse to convince the servants.

801
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,514
如果目的是要让他们相信
Well, if the aim is deception,

802
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:15,437
你难道不该称呼我为"我的丈夫"或者"亲爱的"吗
should you not be addressing me as "my husband,"

803
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,648
开什么玩笑
Don't be ridiculous.

804
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,613
你到底来不来
Well, are you coming or not?

805
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,035
温柔点
Ask me nicely.

806
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:41,796
请问亲爱的夫君  你愿意跟我共享一室吗
Please, dear husband, will you share my chamber?

807
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,668
你睡这儿
Here.

808
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,423
我带了把匕首睡觉
I sleep with a dagger.

809
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:29,427
如果你胆敢来碰我  我会不客气的
If you so much as move to touch me,

810
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:30,762
明白吗
You understand?

811
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,180
谢谢提醒
Thanks for the warning.

812
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,355
狗狗好
Hello, dogs.

813
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,263
戈弗雷
Godfrey.

814
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,567
你的人都到哪儿去了
Where are your men?

815
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,820
他们都死了  大人
They're dead, my Lord.

816
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,072
洛克斯利呢
And Loxley?

817
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,532
还活着
Alive.

818
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,578
那命运把他留给了我来收拾
Then fate has left him to me.

819
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:16,928
我听到男人的脚步声  早上好儿子
I hear a man's steps. Good morning, my son.

820
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:18,847
早上好沃尔特
Morning, Walter.

821
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,057
父亲
Father.

822
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,143
父亲
Father.

823
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,229
你对我的历史都知道些什么
So what is it that you know of my history?

824
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,564
耐心点
Patience.

825
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,526
你今天必须出去示人  带着你的剑
You must show yourself today. Wear your sword.

826
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,279
马里昂
Marion.

827
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,364
我在这儿  沃尔特
I'm here, Walter.

828
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:40,243
带你丈夫重新熟悉一下他的村庄和村民
Reacquaint your husband with his village and his people.

829
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:44,497
我去准备马匹
I'll see to the horses.

830
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:46,624
我感觉自己精神焕发
I feel invigorated.

831
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:49,919
今早醒来感到一阵蓬勃的生机
I woke this morning with a tumescent glow.

832
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:51,754
八十四岁了
Eighty-four.

833
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:54,132
真是奇迹
A miracle.

834
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:58,678
我一直觉得男人间的谈话很神奇
I've always wondered at the private conversations of men.

835
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,431
丈夫
Husband.

836
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,620
真是个富有的小镇
This is a rich country.

837
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,206
你们的牛羊呢
Where's your cattle and your sheep?

838
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:30,251
卖了吃了丢了换了  我们已经度过七个荒年了
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.

839
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,129
现在我们的荤菜是兔子肉
Our meat now is rabbit,

840
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,882
幸运时能打到野猪
or wild pig on a lucky day.

841
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:36,966
鹿呢
And deer?

842
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:41,512
如果你愿意冒着被国王砍头的风险的话
If you're willing to risk your neck to the King's executioner.

843
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,557
这土地上每一只鹿都属于他
Every deer in the land belongs to his Majesty.

844
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:47,185
这些根本不属于国王  它们是上天的恩赐
These things are God's gifts first before the King's possessions.

845
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,814
如果一个人为自己谋生都有罪
If it's illegal for a man to fend for himself,

846
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,650
他怎么争取自己做人的权利呢
how then can he be a man in his own right?

847
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,735
欢迎回家  爵士
Welcome home, Sir.

848
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:56,861
罗伯特爵士  
Sir Robert.

849
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,988
早上好  约瑟夫  艾玛
Good morning, Joseph, Emma.

850
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:02,353
沃尔特爵士是我们的主人
Sir Walter is our Lord,

851
01:17:02,354 --> 01:17:04,285
你是返乡的罗伯特  你得装的像一点
and you are Robert returned and you should act so.

852
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,040
罗伯特爵士  还记得我吗
Sir Robert. You remember me?

853
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,834
汤姆・张伯伦  养猪的
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

854
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:13,753
你看起来一点都没老  汤姆
You don't look a day older, Tom.

855
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,256
罗伯特爵士
Sir Robert.

856
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,716
我们的小伙子们什么时候能回来
When will our young lads come back to us?

857
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,845
能帮我找到我的杰米  让他早点回家吗
Will you find my Jamie, tell him to come home?

858
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:29,435
没有工作也没有食物  小伙子们都离开了
With no work and little food, the village boys have gone.

859
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,853
去当兵了吗  
- To be soldiers?

860
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,188
去偷猎
- Poachers.

861
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:38,695
看看吧  伙计们
Look at that, mate.

862
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,449
你们还在这儿
Still here then?

863
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,460
现在暂时叫我罗伯特爵士  
For the time being, refer to me as Sir Robert. I'l

864
01:17:47,461 --> 01:17:49,330
以后再解释
l explain later.

865
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,543
我亲如手足的兄弟  他们很有礼貌的
My men-at-arms. This is about as courtly as they get.

866
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,380
阿伦・阿德雷  威尔・斯嘉丽还有小约翰
Allan Adayle, Will Scarlet and little John.

867
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,715
马里昂夫人
Lady Marion.

868
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:08,349
我相信你们昨晚过的很难忘
I trust you had an historic evening.

869
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,184
那是当然
For sure.

870
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,942
马里昂・洛克斯利夫人  我妻子
Lady Marion Loxley, my wife.

871
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,069
真不赖啊
Well played.

872
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,157
尽管有点鲁莽  不过干得不错
A bit rash but well played nonetheless.

873
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,658
真有你的  罗宾
Right you are, Robin.

874
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,452
叫我罗伯特爵士
Sir Robert.

875
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,120
-罗伯特爵士  -爵士
- Sir Robert. - Sir...

876
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,497
-先生  -阁下
- Sir. - Sir.

877
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,249
-呆头爵士  -小萝卜头爵士
- Sir Bob. - Sir Robert.

878
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:41,632
修道士  你看
Friar.

879
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:47,972
马里昂  今早从佩珀哈罗传来了好消息
Ah, Marion. Good news travels from Peper Harow this morning.

880
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,351
罗伯特爵士  很高兴再次看见你
Sir Robert, nice to see you again.

881
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,393
你之前就应该明示你的身份  
You should've made yourself known when we met i

882
01:18:53,394 --> 01:18:55,146
欢迎你回来
n the field. Welcome home.

883
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,524
是的  请原谅我的冒失  修道士
Yes, I should've. Forgive me, Friar.

884
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:00,777
这里在干嘛
What happens here?

885
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,738
我们正在把教堂的粮食运往约克
We're moving the church's grain to York.

886
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,573
听说是伦敦新颁布的政策
Politics out of London, I hear.

887
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,618
这是我们大家的种子  它们属于这里的土地
This is our grain. It belongs in this soil.

888
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,704
马里昂夫人  这是上级的意思
Lady Marion, I but follow the orders of my superiors

889
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,207
我不过是服从指令  遵守规定罢了
and abide by their saying and rule.

890
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,672
教皇陛下是否也知道你那些甜美的蜂蜜呢
Does his holiness know about your wealth of honey?

891
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,845
罗伯特爵士  约克的人就是群贪婪的饿狼
There are wolves in York, Sir Robert. voracious wolves.

892
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,973
蜜蜂是我的亲人
The bees are my family.

893
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:33,559
我不过是个养蜂人
I'm a procreator by design.

894
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,021
并不是什么神职人员  从来都不是
I'm not a churchy Friar. Never was.

895
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,649
蜜蜂赐予了我生的意义
My bees give life.

896
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,068
它们比我的生命还重要  罗伯特爵士
They are my life, Sir Robert.

897
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,070
不应该告诉主教大人吗
Should not the bishop be told

898
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:47,323
这样圣职人员就能把诺丁汉的蜂蜜涂抹在用诺丁汉的谷物做的面包上了
so the clergy can spread Nottingham honey

899
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,538
倘若这些粮食无法送到约克呢
What if the grain were not to reach York?

900
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:58,334
那没人会惦记你的蜜蜂
Then the bees need not be spoken of.

901
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,680
认识罗伯特时我已经是个老姑娘了
I was an old maid when Robert courted me.

902
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:13,135
我母亲是位受人尊敬的寡妇  
I was a daughter of a respectable widow

903
01:20:13,136 --> 01:20:15,143
她传承了极少的贵族血统
with a thimbleful of noble blood.

904
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:19,313
我们结婚了  可仅仅一个星期之后
We were wed, and then a week later

905
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:23,442
他就跳上了前往法国和圣地的舰船
He left to join ship for France and the Holy Lands.

906
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,571
这就是我的婚姻
And that was my married life to a man

907
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,283
一个陌生的丈夫
I hardly knew.

908
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,746
和一个美好的夜晚[与"骑士"同音]   甜蜜而短暂的夜晚
A good knight.  Short, but sweet.

909
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,959
不  我是说你丈夫是名优秀的骑士
I mean, he was a good knight.

910
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,503
一位身披铠甲的好骑士  战士
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

911
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,922
是的  他还是个好男人
Oh, yes, my knight-in-arms, even so.

912
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,757
我们本来应该互相依靠的
And I in his.

913
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,082
住手  你会拧断它脖子的
Stop! You'll break its neck.

914
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,388
马里昂
Marion.

915
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,607
没事的
Easy.

916
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,528
我没事
I'm all right.

917
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:56,118
我的脚动不了了
I can't move me legs.

918
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,747
谢谢你
Thank you.

919
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,293
亲爱的夫君
My Lord?

920
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,141
现在才轮到我吗
Oh, is it my turn now?

921
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,485
谢谢你 
Thank you.

922
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,990
干得漂亮  先生
Nicely done, Sir.

923
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,492
还顺便看见马里昂・洛克斯利夫人的美腿了吧
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs,

924
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,911
今天早上之前我以为那是绝对不可能的呢
Beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

925
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:45,084
我想你应该不认识我的丈夫
I don't believe you know my husband,

926
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:46,585
罗伯特爵士
Sir Robert.

927
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,256
请容我向你介绍诺丁汉的郡督大人
Allow me to introduce the sheriff of Nottingham.

928
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,091
欢迎回家  罗伯特爵士
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

929
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:54,351
将国王的公羊救出沼泽  
You make your mark quickly

930
01:22:54,352 --> 01:22:56,012
你已经给我们留下了深刻的印象
by rescuing the king's ram from drowning.

931
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:57,596
你什么意思
What's this?

932
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:59,977
作为横刀夺爱的回报  我有权向你征收税款
What's mine in coin I have the right

933
01:22:59,978 --> 01:23:01,892
你可以上缴物品或是牲畜
to take in goods or livestock.

934
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,895
倘若这是神的意志
If it's god's will.

935
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,985
这是国库规定一只公羊的税款  
Here's a ram's worth of tax for the exchequer.

936
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,446
你对马里昂夫人的无礼  
Your insolence to lady marion,

937
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,531
我会给你记上的
I'll consider a debt between us.

938
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:43,893
来点美味的蜜糖谷醇吗
Mead and grain alcohol?

939
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,853
正合我意
I thought as much.

940
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,692
我们有活要干了
There's something that we need to do.

941
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,527
随时听您差遣
At your service.

942
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,124
好了  伙计们
All right, lads.

943
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,722
早让你们走不走  
Should've left while you had the chance.

944
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:11,545
有活干了  准备下我们就出发
Something's afoot. Off we go.

945
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,230
停下  让马停下
Stop. Stop the horses.

946
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,985
说你呢  靠边点  这可是教会的马车
You there! Move aside! We're on church business!

947
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:37,905
谁也别想过去
None shall pass

948
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:40,533
除非猜出这个谜语
unless they can answer the riddle.

949
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:42,827
他妈的疯子
Moon-mad!

950
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,580
说说看谜语吧  你们这些无礼的混蛋
And what is the riddle, you insolent wretch?

951
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:51,919
什么东西有18条腿  却哪里也去不了
What has 18 legs and isn't going anywhere?

952
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,258
再敢动一下你就死定了
Your next move will be your last.

953
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,760
晚上好啊  我的朋友
Evening, friend.

954
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,931
告诉我你们是谁
I demand to know who you are.

955
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:05,808
我们是斗篷人
We are men of the hood.

956
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,104
开心了吧  你自找的
Merry now, at your expense.

957
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,857
假借上帝旨意夺走的...
The Lord taketh...

958
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,316
由我们来归还
and we shall giveth back.

959
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,944
我建议现在就播种  趁着这月光
My advice is to plant it now, by moonlight.

960
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,320
为什么呢  修道士
Why is that, good Friar?

961
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:21,490
当种子发芽  我就可以说这是上帝的神迹
When it sprouts, I can claim it as a miracle from God.

962
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,618
约克的教会是不会否定神迹的
The church in York would never deny a miracle.

963
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,040
还有多远  
- How much further?

964
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,542
大约11英里
- About 11 miles.

965
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:23,761
我还以为你离开了
I thought you had left.

966
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:26,931
我们去播种了
The fields have been planted.

967
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,975
我不想吵醒你
I didn't want to wake you.

968
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,977
你怎么找到种子的
How did you find the seed?

969
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,813
我只能告诉你不是天上掉下来的
If you have to ask, it's not a gift.

970
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,859
谢谢你
Thank you.

971
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,823
长枪兵  准备
Pikemen, at the ready!

972
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,241
准备
Arms to ready!

973
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,326
准备
Prepare!

974
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,621
约翰国王可不是我的国王
This King John is no King of mine!

975
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,001
你就是鲍德温吧  我命令你打开大门
You! Are you Baldwin? Open these gates!

976
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,836
你以谁的名义来征伐我
In whose name do you come against us?

977
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,754
约翰国王的命令
In the name of King John.

978
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,924
要么缴税  要么等着被烧死吧
Pay or burn.

979
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:47,511
查理国王发动战争时我们供奉过金钱和壮丁了
We have paid in money and men for King Richard's wars!

980
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,638
现在已经所剩无几了
And we have no more to give!

981
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,682
-点火  -弓箭手
- Burn it. - Archers!

982
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,120
来啊
Come on.

983
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,925
大人  这边
My Lord, this way!

984
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,223
以约翰国王的名义
In the name of John,

985
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:36,393
承蒙上帝的恩典  英格兰国王
by the grace of God, King of England,

986
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:41,899
现在责令强制征税
let it be known to all who abide here that a tax is warranted!

987
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:51,325
胆敢违抗法令的人
Those persons refusing to abide by the law

988
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:54,620
将会受到最严厉的惩罚
will hereby be subject to severe punishment.

989
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:02,503
以上法令奉约翰国王之命
By order of his Majesty, King John.

990
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,349
坦克雷德神父
Father Tancred!

991
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:34,451
女王陛下
Your Majesty.

992
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,248
女王陛下
Your Majesty.

993
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,753
我已经对约翰国王失去了信心
I have lost the confidence of King John,

994
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,131
不过我想他还是会听取您的建议
But he may still listen to you.

995
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,466
威廉姆  请不要认为我不懂事理
Allow me to know better, William.

996
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,136
你可比你的猫头鹰要聪明
You are much wiser than your owl.

997
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:55,472
那是肯定  我比它多活了不少春夏秋冬
I dare say. I've lived longer.

998
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,517
爱德华  把它拿走
Edward, take him.

999
01:29:58,601 --> 01:29:59,685
女王陛下
Your Majesty.

1000
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:06,525
约翰和查理可是天壤之别  女王陛下
John is no Richard, alas, your Majesty.

1001
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:13,323
但我效忠的是会一直延续下去的王权
But I serve the throne, and the throne will endure.

1002
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:18,996
马歇尔  说明白一点  你在担心什么
Speak plainly, Marshal. What's troubling you?

1003
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,748
王位已深陷逆境了
The crown is in peril.

1004
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:26,211
戈弗雷与法国国王菲利普串通
Godfrey has been plotting with Philip of France.

1005
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,256
法国军队已经在我海岸登陆
French troops have already landed on our shores,

1006
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:32,092
他们以约翰国王的名义大肆杀戮英国人
And they are murdering Englishmen in the name of King John.

1007
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:36,930
北方的贵族将发动内战  颠覆王位
The northern Barons will make civil war against the throne.

1008
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:40,559
这会让我们的海岸线脆弱不堪
Leaving our coast defenceless against the invasion

1009
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,270
入侵是迟早的事情
which is certainly coming.

1010
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,326
所以  作为约翰的母亲  
So it's left to John's mother to scold

1011
01:30:48,327 --> 01:30:50,736
我就应该训斥他  提醒他的职责所在吗
him like a child and point him to his duty.

1012
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:01,121
我儿子王宫里面的敌人是他最为亲近的朋友
My son has an enemy in his court closer to him than any friend.

1013
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,791
是英国的叛徒  法国人的走狗
An English traitor. A paid agent of France.

1014
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,962
为什么你不亲自告诉他  却来找我
Why are you telling me when you must tell the king?

1015
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,464
伊莎贝拉
Isabella!

1016
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:13,800
这是你的职责所在
It is you who must do that.

1017
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,637
你要告诉约翰国王  你从法国得到消息
Tell King John that you've had word from France, from Philip himself,

1018
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,472
甚至可以说是菲利普国王传来的消息
if you like.

1019
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,059
为什么不告诉他真相   告诉他威廉姆・马歇尔
Why not tell him the truth?

1020
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,396
一个是不被信任的母亲  一个是被他贬职的男人  他会相信吗
Oh! A mother he mistrusts

1021
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:27,689
不会
No.

1022
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:32,986
如果你想做王后  你就必须帮助约翰
If you wish to be queen, you must save John.

1023
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,948
还有英格兰
And England.

1024
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:38,617
不
No!

1025
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,286
不是真的
No! No!

1026
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:47,167
戈弗雷  这个该死的叛徒
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

1027
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,504
上帝告诉我  你在撒谎
By the bowels of Christ, it's a lie.

1028
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,422
你在撒谎
You lie!

1029
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,318
亲爱的  对不起
I'm sorry, my love.

1030
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,295
-郡督在哪里  -在上面
- Sheriff. - Up there.

1031
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:38,302
有个不愿意透露姓名的人  要求见郡督
Man won't give his name. Demands audience with the Sheriff.

1032
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:40,095
要求
Demands?

1033
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,224
退下  
- Go away.

1034
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,392
遵命  大人
- My Lord.

1035
01:33:07,498 --> 01:33:10,167
征税行动迅速
Tax collections proceed apace.

1036
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,919
马上就轮到诺丁汉了
Nottingham's turn is coming.

1037
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,213
很好  非常好
Good. Good.

1038
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:19,176
请告诉戈弗雷爵士  诺丁汉郡督愿为之效劳
Tell Sir Godfrey that the Sheriff of Nottingham is his man.

1039
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,970
这里的一切都听他的安排
May he put his stamp on my authority.

1040
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:26,850
但我想佩珀哈罗的洛克斯利家族会是个麻烦
I see trouble coming from Loxley of Peper Harow.

1041
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,269
一个瞎子也会是麻烦吗
A blind old man gives you trouble?

1042
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,521
不是他  是他的儿子
Aye, and his son will give more.

1043
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:35,901
十字军战士  罗伯特・洛克斯利   上周刚回来
The crusader, Robert Loxley,

1044
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,690
马里昂
Marion.

1045
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,505
闪开  闪开
Go on! Go on.

1046
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,554
他招供了吗
Has he spoken yet?

1047
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,930
他在窥探我们  洛普
He was spying, Loop.

1048
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,807
窥探
Spying?

1049
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,811
罗伯特  你真丢脸
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

1050
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:36,563
你好  马里昂
Hello, Marion.

1051
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,398
我是来救你的
I've come to save you.

1052
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,817
你认识他
Know him?

1053
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:46,156
孩子们  这是罗伯特・洛克斯利爵士  我的丈夫
Boys,

1054
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,701
罗伯特爵士  舍伍德森林的逃兵
Sir Robert, the runaways of Sherwood.

1055
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:51,995
放开他
Untie him.

1056
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,874
别忙  密探就这样放了不便宜了他
No, I don't think spies should be let off so easily.

1057
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,834
这可一点都不友好
That was unkind.

1058
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,711
你是十字军战士吗
You were a crusader?

1059
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:00,921
是的
Yes.

1060
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,965
都听见了吗  你们抓住了一个十字军战士
Did you hear that, boys? You bested a crusader.

1061
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:06,343
我的人个个都骁勇好战  
- My men are good fighters.

1062
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,594
我不这么认为
- I don't know about that.

1063
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:10,096
是人多力量大吧
I think the weight of numbers might have been in their favour.

1064
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,933
不过他们就如同这森林里的动物  行动起来毫无声息 
But they do move silently

1065
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,101
这对于人而言是个不错的技巧
But that's only a skill if you stay as a man.

1066
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,270
不过别成为你们所猎取的动物
You don't become the creatures you hunt.

1067
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,438
我们是战士 
- We're soldiers.

1068
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:19,689
不  你们不是
- No, you're not.

1069
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:22,901
战士战而有因  你们又是为了什么
Soldiers fight for a cause. What's yours?

1070
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:28,114
你们没有目标  所以你们只是偷猎者
You don't have one. That makes you poachers.

1071
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,786
不过是群小贼  要学的还很多
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

1072
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,954
比如呢
Like what?

1073
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,289
我可以教你们怎么打结
I could teach you how to tie knots.

1074
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:39,292
我可以教你选用哪种木材能做出最耐用的弓
I could teach you which wood to get to make your bows stronger.

1075
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:43,588
我能教你做可以射出二十多英尺的箭矢
I could teach you how to make arrows that fly more than 20 feet.

1076
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,384
我还能帮着马里昂教大家如何保持卫生
And I can help Marion to teach you how to stay clean

1077
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:49,469
这样就不会生病
so you won't get sick.

1078
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:53,306
我不知道你和谁交战  但绝不是我
I don't know who you're fighting, son, but it's not me.

1079
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,558
我不是你的敌人
I'm not your enemy.

1080
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:58,562
如果想找人聊天  可以随时来找我
If you want to chat, you know where to find me.

1081
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:13,952
老婆大人  该走了
Wife?

1082
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:22,961
马歇尔
Marshal.

1083
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,006
靠边站  为国王让道
Stand aside! Make way for the king!

1084
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,132
陛下
Your Majesty.

1085
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:32,304
你在这里搞什么
What the devil are you doing here? Hmm?

1086
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,513
陛下
Sire?

1087
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,099
你能让那畜生停下来吗  它怎么  瘫痪了吗
Will you keep that animal still? What's it got, palsy?

1088
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,937
别以为我还不知道你们想要遗弃我
Do you think I haven't noticed how you've deserted me?

1089
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:43,565
如果陛下还记得  我们最后的谈话
If your Majesty recalls, our last conversation...

1090
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,025
我们最后谈话时
At our last conversation,

1091
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,403
法国国王菲利普没有派舰队入侵我们
Philip of France wasn't coming our way with an invasion fleet.

1092
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:50,822
对吧  马歇尔
Was he, Marshal?

1093
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,411
我朋友戈弗雷
My friend Godfrey

1094
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:59,873
已然不是我记忆中的朋友了
is not the friend I thought he was.

1095
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,710
他策划北方贵族反对我
He's stirred up the Northern Barons against me.

1096
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:06,588
他们率军南下
They come south with an army.

1097
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,675
马歇尔  他们怎么敢这么做  怎么能
Marshal, how dare they? How dare they?

1098
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,595
陛下  被遗忘的人往往是最危险的人
Sire, forgotten men are dangerous men.

1099
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:18,350
你需要告诉北方贵族们
The Barons need to be told

1100
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:22,354
法国人侵略来了  我们要团结起来
that when the French come, we are all Englishmen.

1101
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:24,773
费兹罗伯特  
- Fitzrobert.

鲍德温
- Baldwin.

1103
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,819
我们会组织一支北方联军  向伦敦进发
We'll make an army of the North and march on London.

1104
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:32,113
军队需要领导者
The Barons need leadership.

1105
01:38:33,115 --> 01:38:36,993
睿智的国王知道他们必须真诚对待人民
Wiser kings know they must let men look them in the eye,

1106
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,788
认真听取他们的意见
hear their voice.

1107
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:43,792
让我们团结一致  北上与贵族们相接
Together, let us ride north to meet them.

1108
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:49,506
他们在讨伐自己的国王  马歇尔
They march against their King, Marshal.

1109
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,134
他们的国王
Their King.

1110
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,546
我要让他们看看
We will meet them with the pikes of

1111
01:38:56,547 --> 01:38:58,431
我是如何用剑戳穿他们肚子的
 our militia in their gizzards.

1112
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,643
你已经不识时务了  马歇尔
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

1113
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:06,314
或许北上不应该带你了
Perhaps we'll look to the Barons without you.

1114
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:20,620
把马鞍套上  我要立刻出发
Saddle up with a spare horse. I leave immediately.

1115
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:22,247
我想知道哪里能找到戈弗雷
I want to know where to find Godfrey.

1116
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:23,665
遵命  大人
My lord.

1117
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,223
我找到他了  大人  
- I found him, my lord.

1118
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:41,391
在哪儿
- Where?

1119
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:45,729
在诺丁汉  
Nottingham.

1120
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,695
冒充成沃尔特・洛克斯利的儿子大摇大摆
In plain sight, living as Walter Loxley's son.

1121
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:57,198
那我们去诺丁汉
Then we go to Nottingham.

1122
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,203
不要俘虏  不留一个活口
Take no prisoners. Leave no stone un-scorched.

1123
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,483
带两男四马
Take two men, four horses.

1124
01:40:04,484 --> 01:40:06,541
速去海边  然后回巴黎将消息带给国王
Ride hard for the coast, then on to Paris and give a message to the King.

1125
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,853
诺丁汉会因我而名留青史
I'll make the place famous.

1126
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,858
埃伦  来啊
Come, Allan!

1127
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:35,069
我负责酒水  你负责跳舞
I'll get them drinking. You get them dancing!

1128
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:36,237
太棒了
All right.

1129
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:12,315
音乐  笑声  篝火上棕色的脆皮烤猪
Music, laughter, the crackle of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

1130
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:16,152
幸福又降临了  全得归功于你  罗宾
Life has returned. You have returned it, Robin.

1131
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:18,358
你怎么知道是我
How did you know it was me?

1132
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:22,028
谁会未经请求
Who else would sit by me uninvited

1133
01:43:22,821 --> 01:43:25,448
坐在我身边  像个昔日的好友
like a friend from the old days?

1134
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:27,659
威廉姆  你好吗
How are you, William?

1135
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,287
还好  就是有点苦恼
I'm well and troubled.

1136
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:33,873
你来这里干什么
Ah. And what brings you?

1137
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:37,001
我今夜将前往巴恩斯代尔
I'm riding on to Barnsdale tonight.

1138
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:39,411
我听说北方贵族
I've heard something of the Barons'

1139
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:41,381
对国王的征税条例满腔愤怒
anger against the crown's tax collector...

1140
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:43,883
怒火已经转化为行动
The anger has turned into action.

1141
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,135
他们组织军队准备讨伐国王
They assemble to march against the King.

1142
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,805
你觉得你能劝服北方军队回去吗
You think you can persuade the Barons to turn back?

1143
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:49,973
回去  不
Turn back, no.

1144
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:55,144
我会试图说服他们联合约翰国王击退法国侵略者
To join King John

1145
01:43:56,313 --> 01:43:58,481
-你说什么  -帮帮我  沃尔特
- A what? - Help me, Walter.

1146
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,775
我无法同你前去
I cannot go with you.

1147
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,444
我无法认同他
I cannot speak for this King.

1148
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:05,113
可他是我们唯一的国王啊
He is the only King we have.

1149
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:06,614
但并不是我们唯一的希望
But not the only hope.

1150
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,866
你什么意思
Explain.

1151
01:44:10,452 --> 01:44:11,494
马里昂  
- Marion.

1152
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:12,662
我来了  沃尔特
- I'm here, Walter.

1153
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,248
这位是我老朋友  威廉姆・马歇尔
This is my old friend, William Marshal.

1154
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,834
马里昂・洛克斯利女士  我的儿媳
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

1155
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,753
夫人   很荣幸在罗伯特爵士下船时见了他一面
Lady,

1156
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:23,339
马歇尔  我想你应该清楚
I think you know better, Marshal.

1157
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:28,177
威廉姆爵士   我知道还想再见罗宾・朗斯特莱德一面
Sir William,

1158
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:40,773
我们之前见过
We've met before.

1159
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,276
是的  我知道  在伦敦
Yes, Sir, I know. in London.

1160
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,530
不  在你很小的时候
No, when you were a child.

1161
01:44:49,366 --> 01:44:51,034
还在骑竹马的时候
Hobby-horse age.

1162
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:55,705
沃尔特和我从圣地回来接你回家
Sir Walter and I returned from the Holy Land to fetch you home.

1163
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:57,457
但你已经不在了
But you'd gone.

1164
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:00,710
我们失去了汤姆斯・朗斯特莱德的儿子
We had lost Thomas Longstride's son.

1165
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:06,799
那是永远的痛
It was a wound that never healed.

1166
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,726
我需要知道我所知的一切
You need to know what I know.

1167
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,688
你父亲是一名石匠
Your father was a stonemason.

1168
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,900
你对此满意吗
Is that pleasing to you?

1169
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,237
是的
Yes, it is.

1170
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,074
但他可不是个普通的石匠  他还是个预言家
But he was more than that. He was a visionary.

1171
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,577
他预言了什么
What did he see?

1172
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,622
国王需要臣民
That Kings have a need of their subjects,

1173
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:41,751
如同臣民需要国王一样
no less than their subjects have need of Kings.

1174
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,503
危险的观点
A dangerous idea.

1175
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:47,340
你的父亲是个哲学家   他有独特的演说方式
Your father was a philosopher.

1176
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,551
能够让人心服口服
that took you by the ears and by the heart.

1177
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:53,596
这些东西是不能被写下来的  罗宾
None of these things can be written down, Robin.

1178
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,682
你只能将它们铭记于心
You must commit them to your very soul.

1179
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:59,060
这就是记忆的学问
This is the science of memory.

1180
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:05,149
奋起反抗  再反抗  直到羔羊变成雄狮
"Rise and rise again until lambs become lions."

1181
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:12,615
最终  成百上千的人接受了他的观点  也响应了他
Finally, hundreds listened, thousands,

1182
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:16,160
为了所有阶级的权利作斗争的号召
for the rights of all ranks from Baron to serf.

1183
01:46:19,289 --> 01:46:20,957
奋起反抗  再反抗
"Rise and rise again,

1184
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,461
直到羔羊变成雄狮
until lambs become lions."

1185
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,385
他最后怎么了
What happened to him?

1186
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,762
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

1187
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:45,356
国之根基在于全体人民的自由权利
... foundation is set on the rights of liberty for all people!

1188
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:53,406
朗斯特莱德  交出宪章和他们的名字
Longstride, give up the charter and their names!

1189
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,157
你当时在场
You were there.

1190
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:56,742
你亲眼目睹了
You saw it.

1191
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:01,414
不
I will not.

1192
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:26,981
他的精神不能和他一起逝去
Not dead.

1193
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:33,863
至少现在不能
Not now.

1194
01:47:38,201 --> 01:47:41,913
这是我摘抄的主要宪章
Here is my copy of the main contract.

1195
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:45,833
这份权利宪章是你父亲所写
This charter of rights was written by your father.

1196
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:47,913
这些是
And here are...

1197
01:47:47,914 --> 01:47:49,962
这些是签署宪章的所有贵族的名字
There are the names of all the Barons that signed the charter.

1198
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:53,090
费兹罗伯特  鲍德温  马歇尔  和我
Fitzrobert, Baldwin, Marshal and myself.

1199
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,261
他想要的是一部能让所有人
What he wanted was a charter for every man...

1200
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:58,429
在那等着 
- Wait there.

1201
01:47:58,513 --> 01:47:59,889
享有同等权利的宪章
- to have the same rights.

1202
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:01,474
沃尔特爵士  有信使找您
Sir Walter? A messenger for you.

1203
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:03,100
让他进来
Bring him in.

1204
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:04,727
过来  先生
Step forward, sir.

1205
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:06,687
阁下  
- My Lord.

1206
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:09,482
请说吧
- I'm listening.

1207
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,775
国王的手下放火烧了彼得伯勒
Peterborough's been burned by the King's men.

1208
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:12,944
费兹罗伯特召集了一队人马
Fitzrobert gathers an army

1209
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:16,489
前往伦敦讨伐约翰国王
to slay King John in London.

1210
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,742
马歇尔请您出席在巴恩斯代尔举行的商讨会
Marshal requests your presence at counsel in Barnsdale.

1211
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:23,663
请到外面稍等
Wait outside, will you?

1212
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,750
时势造英雄
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

1213
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,337
演戏的时间结束了
The time for pretence is over.

1214
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:35,675
现在  像儿子那样拥抱我吧
Now, hold me like a son.

1215
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,141
去吧
Go.

1216
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:48,437
玛吉  夫人在哪
Maggie. Where's my Lady?

1217
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:50,106
我没看到她  阁下
I could not find her, Sir.

1218
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:20,970
无论我们是为活着  为家庭  还是为荣誉而战
Whether we fight for our lives,

1219
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:22,972
我们都必须战斗到最后一刻
we must fight till the death.

1220
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,809
威廉姆  你在王宫里待太久了
You've spent too long in the palace, William.

1221
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:30,229
待在王宫里教会了我如何权衡轻重
Spending time in the palace gives me perspective.

1222
01:49:31,356 --> 01:49:32,815
就在我们说话的时候
As we speak,

1223
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:36,861
菲利普国王正在乘船前往我们的海岸
King Philip sails for our coast.

1224
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:42,366
戈弗雷 和他的掠夺者都是法国人
Godfrey and his marauders are French!

1225
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:46,954
我们浪费在争议上的每一分钟
Every minute that we waste in disunity

1226
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:50,291
都让国家离毁灭更近一步
brings closer the destruction of our country!

1227
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,418
早在戈弗雷之前  我们就已经被
We have been bled

1228
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,838
我们的国王弄得遍体鳞伤了
by the king long before Godfrey.

1229
01:49:56,214 --> 01:49:59,008
回伦敦去告诉国王
Go back to London and tell the King

1230
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:03,471
决战的地点由他来定
that we will meet him on a field of his choice.

1231
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:04,597
让开
Make way!

1232
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:07,308
我们不会为了保卫约翰的王冠而战
We will not fight to save John's crown.

1233
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:10,603
宁可让他屈服于我们
Rather let him bend the knee to us.

1234
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:14,023
我会给你更多  鲍德温爵士
I'll give you more, Sir Baldwin.

1235
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:17,526
你的剑可以刺入我的胸膛
My breast for your sword point.

1236
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:20,863
你甚至可以用我的剑
Use mine.

1237
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:26,452
来啊
Go on.

1238
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,038
不刺吗
No?

1239
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:33,501
这不就是你想要的吗   或许这才是他想要的
Oh, this is what you want, isn't it?

1240
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:37,546
好啊  我宁可把王冠给你  也不愿它被法国人抢走
Fine, I'd rather give it to you

1241
01:50:38,548 --> 01:50:40,800
陛下  您误会我了
You mistake me, Sire.

1242
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:44,595
我没有权利  也没有野心戴上王冠
I have no right and no ambition to wear the crown.

1243
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,973
但是要让有权戴王冠的人知道
But let the rightful wearer beware.

1244
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:50,434
从今往后  我们只服从于
From now we will be subject only

1245
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:52,478
人民参与制定的法律
to laws that we have a hand in making.

1246
01:50:52,562 --> 01:50:57,316
我们不是任你宰割的羔羊
We are not sheep to be made mutton of by your butchers.

1247
01:50:59,111 --> 01:51:02,780
戈弗雷策动你们反抗我
Godfrey set himself to turn you against me.

1248
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:06,033
他的真实目的不仅于此
Then he did more than was needed to accomplish that.

1249
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,748
一项重要的决定
A very important decision.

1250
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:15,424
大家不认为我们长期以来
Don't you think that we've paid

1251
01:51:15,425 --> 01:51:17,002
背负了太多苛捐杂税吗
too much taxes for far too long...

1252
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:26,697
这是我出生的地方
This is where I was born.

1253
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:42,963
这是什么意思 
- What does it mean? -

1254
01:52:43,048 --> 01:52:44,548
永不放弃
 It means never give up.

1255
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:50,512
我们决不会忠于一位残酷剥削人民的国王
We will not be loyal to a crown

1256
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:54,099
国王要听取民意
The king must listen to what we have to say!

1257
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:56,402
国王不会向臣民乞求
A king does not bargain for the loyalty

1258
01:52:56,403 --> 01:52:58,979
他们应当给予的忠诚
that every subject owes him.

1259
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:03,776
失去忠诚  国将灭亡  一切都是空谈
Without loyalty there is no kingdom.

1260
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,279
我来代表沃尔特・洛克斯利爵士发言
I'm here to speak for sir Walter Loxley.

1261
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,659
让他说  让他说
Let the man speak. Let him speak!

1262
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,119
说吧
Speak! Speak!

1263
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:16,956
有话就说吧
Speak, if you must.

1264
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:21,377
想要构筑未来
If you're trying to build for the future,

1265
01:53:22,045 --> 01:53:24,588
必须夯实基础
you must set your foundation strong.

1266
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:30,886
这片土地的法律  使人民被国王所奴役
The laws of this land

1267
01:53:32,555 --> 01:53:36,809
国王要求人民忠诚  却无所回报
a king who demands loyalty but offers nothing in return.

1268
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:41,230
我一路征战  从法国
I have marched from France

1269
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:43,857
到巴勒斯坦  然后归来
to Palestine and back.

1270
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:46,235
我知道
And I know

1271
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:49,989
暴政的结局只有失败
in tyranny lies only failure.

1272
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:54,118
九层之台  起于垒土
You build a country like you build a cathedral,

1273
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:55,494
国家亦是如此
from the ground up.

1274
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:58,872
赋予每个人应有的权利
Empower every man

1275
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:01,292
才能获得支持
...and you will gain strength.

1276
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:06,797
谁能反对这些至理名言
Well, who could object to such reasonable words?

1277
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:12,928
如果陛下愿意给予公平正义
If your Majesty were to offer justice,

1278
01:54:14,139 --> 01:54:16,473
以自由权利宪章的形式加以保障
justice in the form of a charter of liberties,

1279
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,936
允许人民养家糊口
allowing every man to forage for his hearth,

1280
01:54:21,604 --> 01:54:25,190
不被无故定罪
to be safe from conviction without cause

1281
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,276
或者无罪入狱
or prison without charge,

1282
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:32,072
人民能够通过自己辛勤劳动谋生
to work, eat and live on the sweat of his own brow

1283
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,825
并且尽情享乐  
and be as merry as he can...

1284
01:54:34,909 --> 01:54:36,577
阁下  戈弗雷的部队正前往诺丁汉
Sir, Godfrey's men are on to Nottingham.

1285
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:39,747
那就能成为一位伟大的国王
...then that King would be great.

1286
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:44,084
不仅能得到臣民的忠诚
Not only would he receive the loyalty of his people,

1287
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:46,879
还能获得人民的爱戴
but their love, as well.

1288
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:51,133
那你有什么建议呢
So what would you have? Hmm?

1289
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:52,968
为每个人建造城堡
Castle for every man?

1290
01:54:55,305 --> 01:54:57,473
每个英国人的家就是他们的城堡
Every Englishman's home is his castle.

1291
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,643
陛下  我们想要的
What we would ask, your Majesty,

1292
01:55:03,104 --> 01:55:04,563
是自由
is liberty.

1293
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:07,024
法律赋予的自由
Liberty by law!

1294
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:11,320
陛下  还有各位大人
Your Majesty, my Lords,

1295
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,698
法国舰队到达海峡了
the French fleet is in the channel.

1296
01:55:14,783 --> 01:55:19,787
陛下  统一所有国民的机会就在眼前
Sire, you have a chance to unify your subjects high and low.

1297
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:23,207
您点头同意即可
It falls on your nod.

1298
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:25,918
只需要我点头吗
I only have to nod?

1299
01:55:30,006 --> 01:55:31,590
我能够做得更好
I can do better than that.

1300
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:35,844
我保证
I give my word,

1301
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:39,598
会制定一部那样的宪章
that such a charter will be written.

1302
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:43,018
我以我母亲的性命起誓
On my mother's life, I swear it.

1303
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:51,527
戈弗雷的军队正向诺丁汉进军   我必须陪伴国王左右
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.

1304
01:55:51,611 --> 01:55:53,654
我会派鲍德温  费兹罗伯特和你同去
I will send Baldwin and Fitzrobert with you.

1305
01:55:53,738 --> 01:55:57,533
战斗结束后  我们在怀特霍斯会合
We will meet again at the White Horse

1306
01:55:57,617 --> 01:56:00,661
罗宾  你父亲是一位伟大的人
Robin, your father was a great man.

1307
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,206
虎父无犬子
And you are your father's son.

1308
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:16,718
玛吉  去看看造访我们的是谁
Maggie, who's at the house?

1309
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:19,596
国王万岁
Long live the King!

1310
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,842
先生们
Gentlemen.

1311
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:13,775
我是诺丁汉的郡长
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1312
01:57:18,865 --> 01:57:20,616
我的母亲是法国人
I'm French on my mother's side.

1313
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:44,848
沃尔特爵士
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

1314
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:54,316
洛克斯利
Loxley!

1315
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:56,235
出来
Show yourself!

1316
01:57:58,363 --> 01:57:59,655
洛克斯利
Loxley!

1317
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:03,867
谁在这大声喧哗
Who calls here?

1318
01:58:04,535 --> 01:58:06,495
我来找罗伯特・洛克斯利
I call for Robert Loxley.

1319
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:08,705
我儿子不在这
My son is not here to answer you.

1320
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:10,123
这倒是真的
That is the truth.

1321
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,084
因为他死在法国的壕沟里
Because he's dead in a French ditch.

1322
01:58:14,504 --> 01:58:15,879
先生  你是谁  为什么这么说
And who are you, Sir, to say so?

1323
01:58:17,715 --> 01:58:19,258
我是谁
Who am I?

1324
01:58:27,725 --> 01:58:28,892
我是杀了他的人
I'm the one who killed him.

1325
01:58:31,521 --> 01:58:33,021
你有胆的话就和我决斗
Fight me if you dare.

1326
01:58:34,148 --> 01:58:35,565
仁慈的主啊
Lord have mercy.

1327
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:26,074
放到桌上  下一个
Leave it on the table. Leave it! Next!

1328

1330
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:34,249

1354
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:18,069
菲利普国王会在何时何地登陆

1355
02:06:31,917 --> 02:06:33,877
这是最后一箭
This is my last arrow.

1356

1358
02:08:12,601 --> 02:08:15,186
我曾经与一个前往战场的男人告别
Once before I said goodbye to a man going to war.

1359
02:08:16,146 --> 02:08:17,480
他却再也没有回来
He never came back.

1360
02:08:23,862 --> 02:08:25,238
好好和我告别吧
Ask me nicely.

1361
02:09:00,274 --> 02:09:01,566
我爱你  马里昂
I love you, Marion.

朗斯特莱德
Longstride!

1363
02:11:58,911 --> 02:12:00,745
沃尔特和诺丁汉那边有什么消息
What news of Walter and Nottingham?

1364
02:12:01,997 --> 02:12:04,582
沃尔特爵士过世了  戈弗雷干的
Sir Walter is dead. Godfrey's hand.

1365
02:12:04,666 --> 02:12:07,418
先生们  上战场吧
Gentlemen, we go to war.

1366
02:12:07,628 --> 02:12:10,338
我第一次征战  由我带队
It is my first time. I shall lead.

1367
02:12:10,422 --> 02:12:12,465
前进
Forward!

1368
02:13:52,566 --> 02:13:54,191
有很多法国人
That's a lot of French.

1369
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:58,195
接下来怎么做
What's to be done?

1370
02:13:59,573 --> 02:14:00,698
弓箭手到崖顶上去
Archers to the cliff top.

1371
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:04,368
骑兵向海滩前进  我们在那等你
Cavalry to the beach. We'll await you there.

1372
02:14:04,745 --> 02:14:05,786
跟着我  
- With me!

1373

1374
02:14:09,374 --> 02:14:11,167

1383
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:12,079
上帝啊  马里昂
For the love of God, Marion!

1384
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:17,793
洛克斯利
Loxley,

1385
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:21,047
让你的人马列队  加入进攻

1386
02:16:26,178 --> 02:16:27,303
跟着我

02:17:53,348 --> 02:17:54,932
弓骑兵  前进
Archers, forward!

1391
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:23,794
马歇尔  我们也上

1392
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:25,004
陛下  我们靠得够近了
We're close enough, Sire.

1393
02:18:26,047 --> 02:18:27,882
对查理来说不够
This was not close enough for Rchard.

1394
02:18:27,966 --> 02:18:29,800
那你想想他最后的结局
And look what happened to him.

1395
02:18:30,844 --> 02:18:31,886
前进
Forward!

1396
02:18:32,929 --> 02:18:34,305
保护国王
Protect the king!

1397
02:19:05,587 --> 02:19:07,379
我要为你报仇  沃尔特
This is for you, Walter.

1398
02:19:20,477 --> 02:19:23,479
不

1399
02:19:30,779 --> 02:19:32,029

朗斯特莱德
Longstride!

1408
02:23:17,005 --> 02:23:19,339
我并没有自立为王
I did not make myself King.

1409
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:23,260
那是上帝的旨意
God did.

1410
02:23:24,345 --> 02:23:26,346
君授神权
King by divine right.

1411
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:30,893
如今你们拿着这份公文前来
Now you come to me with this document

1412
02:23:32,437 --> 02:23:36,189
试图限制上帝赋予我的权利
Seeking to limit the authority given to me by god!

1413
02:23:36,274 --> 02:23:38,775
陛下  您曾经起誓了
Sire, you gave your word!

1414
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,027
不
No.

1415
02:23:40,111 --> 02:23:42,112
陛下  您向我们起誓了  
Sire, you give us our word, Sire!

1416
02:23:42,196 --> 02:23:44,114
先生  我允许你说话了吗
Did I command you to speak, Sir?

1417
02:23:44,198 --> 02:23:45,198
约翰  
- John...

1418
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:46,533
或是你  夫人
- Or you, Madam?

1419
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:48,368
陛下  我们将希望寄托于您
Sire, we looked to you!

1420
02:23:48,786 --> 02:23:51,705
还是把希望寄托在你们的财产上吧
Look to your estates, instead.

1421
02:23:55,043 --> 02:23:56,335
弓箭手
Archers!

1422
02:23:57,045 --> 02:24:00,213
你们应该庆幸我现在心怀仁慈
You are fortunate that I am in a merciful mood.

1423
02:24:01,382 --> 02:24:05,761
但是对于罗宾・朗斯特莱德   那个石匠的儿子
But as for Robin Longstride,

1424
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:11,266
犯下了偷窃和煽动暴乱的大罪
for the crimes of theft and incitement to cause unrest,

1425
02:24:11,351 --> 02:24:13,677
还假冒骑士  
who pretended to be a knight of the realm,

1426
02:24:13,678 --> 02:24:15,228
其罪当斩
a crime punishable by death,

1427
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:20,651
我宣布  从今往后  剥夺他一切法律权益
I declare him, from this day forth,

1428
02:24:22,570 --> 02:24:26,198
一生都将被追捕

1429
02:24:26,282 --> 02:24:28,116
我们不同意  
We will not stand for this!

1430
02:24:28,201 --> 02:24:30,327
直到他的尸骨腐烂
...until his corpse, unburied, is carrion

1431
02:24:30,411 --> 02:24:33,121
成为狐狸和乌鸦的口中餐
for foxes and crows!

1432
02:24:56,187 --> 02:24:57,980
听我说
Hear me! Hear me!

1433
02:25:01,109 --> 02:25:02,818

以及任何包庇他  帮助他的人

1436
02:25:10,368 --> 02:25:12,035
都会被判为不法之徒

他们的财产将被没收

1438
02:25:14,956 --> 02:25:19,126
任何人发现他们都可以取其性命

1439
02:25:25,091 --> 02:25:27,801
请给我一个钉子  以及锤子

1440
02:25:28,511 --> 02:25:29,594
钉子
A nail!

1441
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,023
你可以走了  过来
Off you go. Come on.

1442
02:26:23,941 --> 02:26:25,108
孩子们
Hey, boys.

1443
02:26:25,193 --> 02:26:27,110
-你们有练习打结吗  -有

1444
02:26:27,195 --> 02:26:29,029
有练习射箭吗
Have you been shooting your bow and arrows?

1445
02:26:29,113 --> 02:26:30,697
有人射中吗
Who hit something? Anyone?

1446
02:26:30,782 --> 02:26:33,617
绿林是无法者的安身之地
The greenwood is the outlaw's friend.

1447
02:26:33,701 --> 02:26:36,453
如今  孤儿们欢迎我们的到来

没有贫富差距  大自然所给予的一切都被均分
Nobody rich, nobody poor.

1450
02:26:43,544 --> 02:26:47,714
国王约翰的统治仍有许多错误需要被纠正
Many wrongs to be righted in the country of King John.

1451
02:26:51,052 --> 02:26:53,220
