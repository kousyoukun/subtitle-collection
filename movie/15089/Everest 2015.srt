"Everest (2015)" ^ (Run time : 01:49:25)

2
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,475
Based on a true story.

3
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:20,484
Enmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the
first mountaineers to reach the summit of Everest.

4
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:25,478
Over the next 40 years. Professional, expert
mountaineers tried to accomplish the same feat.

5
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:28,382
One in four died

6
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:32,295
1992:
New Zealander, Rob Hall created the concept of guided
commercial expeditions to Everest for amateur mountaineers.

7
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:36,176
During the next 4 years, his team, "Adventure Consultants"
successfully guided 19 clients to the summit,

8
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,765
without a single death.

9
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:44,253
1996:
Other commercial operators follow the example of Rob Hall,
including "Mountain Madness", by Scott Fischer.

10
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:49,543
Completing over 20 expeditions to reach the summit
of Everest in the same period of 2 weeks

11
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:52,524
Please listen up.

12
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:54,921
Guys.

13
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,941
We got 2000 feet,

14
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,096
600 vertical metres (m)

15
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:02,233
to Camp 4.

16
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,466
Let's rope all the way,

17
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,605
so I know you can make it.

18
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:09,950
Alright, once we get to the
Yellow band, we're going to regroup.

19
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:12,783
Put on the mask,
turn on the gas.

20
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,627
Make sense?

21
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,408
$325 a bottle,

22
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:09,342
- for oxygen.
(6 weeks ago...)

23
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,426
- It's daylight robbery.
(6 weeks ago...)

24
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:13,473
Yeah. Well, he's corner the market,
he's got it

25
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:16,631
He reckon there's going to be
20 teams at Base camp this season.

26
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:19,033
- 20 teams?
- I mean with all the Sherpas and porters

27
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:21,423
it's going to be
squeeze up there.

28
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:24,728
Lets...
scrum on the ropes right there.

29
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:25,846
What is this?

30
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,993
It's Helen's.

31
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,896
It's a little decoration
for the mess in.

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,173
- Hey, you can wear them on your head, y'hear.
- I'll have it, thank you.

33
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay, I got some news.

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,980
- We got Krakauer.
- Huh?

35
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,087
Oh, yeah!

36
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:38,626
- You stole him from Scott Fischer.
- No, he made his own mind.

37
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,502
Good job, Rob.

38
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,526
How much is he paying you, Rob?

39
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:46,001
Well, he's...
only paying for his airfare.

40
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,913
but we got 5000 words

41
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,888
in the magazine and our picture
in the front cover.  Huh.

42
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:53,555
That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.

43
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,024
Or if you get him to the top.

44
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:58,016
If... If...
How can you say that to me?

45
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:59,459
Here you go, I got you.
You alright?

46
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:00,878
Thanks, Guy.
Cheers, mate.

47
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,159
- Hey.
- Hi, Rob.

48
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:05,972
- You alright?
- Oh, yeah. How are you?

49
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,725
- I am good. Oh, look at you.
- I know.

50
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,471
- Big.
- Here you go.

51
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:11,459
You good?

52
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:12,644
- Yeh, you know.
- Okay.

53
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,329
Just going to miss you.

54
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,231
Let's go, Guy.

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,637
Just-Just go careful, alright?

56
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,531
- It's just...
- Please don't.

57
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,661
Come on, please don't worry.

58
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:29,356
It's just that doing nothing back here
that's making me worry.

59
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,072
- You're not doing nothing.
- No, but...

60
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,713
What?

61
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,413
It's the waiting for you.

62
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,634
- For him.
- Ha ha.

63
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,725
- Her.
- Her.

64
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,307
Just, be back for the birth,
Rob Hall.

65
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,377
You try and stop me.

66
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:56,074
- Okay, I love you.
- Go, or I'll cry.

67
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,737
Go.

68
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:18,637
KATHMANDU, NEPAL

69
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,678
30th March 1996

70
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,204
Here.

71
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:25,954
- That all you got.
- Yeah. That's it.

72
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:28,274
I think we're over here.

73
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:39,132
Hey...
What work outfit you guys with?

74
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:41,745
- Adventure Consultants.
- Uh, good, me too.

75
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,362
I'm Beck.
Beck Weathers.

76
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:44,850
Doug Hansen.

77
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,656
- Jon Krakauer.
- How're you doing?

78
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:48,067
- Okay.
- Are you...

79
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:50,271
Krakauer from Outside magazine.

80
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:51,959
- Yeah.
- Really?

81
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,151
What're you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?

82
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,115
A little bit of both.

83
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,242
Well. I'll let you know
how the Summit goes, okay?

84
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:02,822
- No need, I'll be there.
- We'll see.

85
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,634
What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?

86
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,529
- What? Work?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:25,322
Uh, different things.
Carpenter, mailman.

88
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,197
- Carpenter, mailman.
- Yep.

89
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,237
- Seriously, you deliver the mail?
- Yep, I deliver the mail.

90
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:35,269
Mailman on Everest?

91
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,040
- Hope so.
- Ha ha. I like that.

92
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,101
Mailman on Everest.

93
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:49,197
There we go.

94
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,694
- There.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,016
You know, he made it to the
South Summit on Everest last year.

96
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,226
- Who? Doug did?
- Yeah.

97
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:58,848
- That's pretty hot for a mailman.
- Yep

98
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:01,338
Brown's Peak,
McKinley.

99
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:04,252
I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.

100
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:05,305
I know.

101
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,108
- How did you know that?
- 89', right?

102
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:11,230
Ohhh.
You done your research.

103
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:13,112
That's what we do.

104
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,281
You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.

105
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:26,500
A histroy made famous
by George Everest,

106
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:29,545
George Mallory, Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary...

107
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,685
- And Rob Hall.
- lege...

108
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,715
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,091
legend... lege...
legends, all of them.

110
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,014
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Eh ha ha...

111
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,735
That's right.

112
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:40,798
For those of you who dare
face the dreams,

113
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:45,514
Adventure Consultants offer something
beyond the power of words to describe.

114
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,326
And why don't we
describe it in the brochure.

115
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:52,100
Because it's mostly just pain.

116
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,408
- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth.

117
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,165
And the odd,
if you don't mind, Mike.

118
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,002
And the odd missing toe.

119
00:07:58,685 --> 00:07:59,841
There we go.

120
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,192
- Oh...
- Uuu...

121
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,014
To put it simply, guys.

122
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,978
Human beings
simply aren't built to function

123
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:09,946
at the cruising altitude of a 747.

124
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:13,560
Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Col.

125
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,836
Our bodies will be literally dying
and I mean literally dying.

126
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,016
It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,473
So, the game is,
can we get you up to the top

128
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,872
and down to the bottom
before that happens.

129
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,468
- You sure can.
- Oh.

130
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:29,932
Beck Weathers,
ladies and gentlemen.

131
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,048
You might've noticed he's a
bit of a lone star state.

132
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:36,376
100% Texan right here, people.
100% Texan.

133
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,773
You met Mike Groom.

134
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:41,261
I like to introduce you to Andy Harris.
- Or Harold.

135
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,844
Harold had got out of Queenstown.

136
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:44,903
Taranaki actually,
originally Canada.

137
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:47,068
Helen and the rest of the team are
already on their way up to Base Camp.

138
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,524
They're setting it up
when we get there.

139
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,412
- Today is March 30th, people.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:53,631
I plan on going to
the Summit, May 10th.

141
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:55,894
It's been a lucky day for me
in Adventure Consultants,

142
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,552
and the weather is usually
pretty stable around then.

143
00:08:58,576 --> 00:08:59,897
So that means,

144
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:03,639
We have 40 days,
to train your bodies and your minds

145
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:04,866
to go for it.

146
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,841
Now. I know there is a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room

147
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,302
you wouldn't be here without it.

148
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:12,263
- Stu, K2, Broad Peak.
- Nice.

149
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:16,490
John Taske,
1192m of Mount Kosciuszko.

150
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,657
- Ha ha ha...
- Eh ha ha...

151
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,105
- And Yasuko Namba.
- Oh.

152
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,489
- 6 of the 7 Summits.
- Yeah.

153
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:23,528
- An amazing woman.
- There you go.

154
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,177
- Let's make it 7.
- Thank you.

155
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:28,876
But, Everest though, is another beast.
Another beast altogether.

156
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,750
That's why you're here.
Isn't that right, Dougy.

157
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:33,837
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

158
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:35,403
So, listen.
Tonight, that's it for me.

159
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:39,033
Eat, drink, be merry.
Tomorrow we trek.

160
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,350
Alright, let's go.

161
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,961
Alright, folks, hang on.

162
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:50,039
Okay.

163
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:51,508
That's it.
Here we go, colonel

164
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,306
Alright, everybody, earbuds.

165
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,397
Take your seats.
Buckle in, everyone.

166
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:56,995
Thanks, bud.

167
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,331
Here we go.

168
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,386
Lukla : 2,860 metres

169
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:39,370
Take it easy.

170
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:42,952
- Ready.
- Let's go.

171
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,871
You lead the way.

172
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,774
- Are you alright?
- Come on, man.

173
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:22,392
Namche Bazzar : 3,750 metres

174
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,663
Guys, man want to see
your climbing permits.

175
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:27,280
Need to see all
your climbing permits.

176
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,846
Thank you very much.
We'll see you on the way back.

177
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,553
Thank you very much.

178
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,850
- All good?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you?

179
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,130
- Yeah.
- Hey...

180
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,783
Thanks, Rob.

181
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:42,283
- Thanks for what?
- You know, the discount.

182
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:45,650
You're working 3 jobs, Doug.

183
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,188
It's the least I can do, right?

184
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:50,909
I know you didn't have to do it.
I appreciated it.

185
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,477
Let's just get you
to the top this time.

186
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,256
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,905
Yeah.

188
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,515
How're you feeling, Beck?

189
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:09,914
About a third to midland.

190
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,697
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.

191
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:14,014
Thought I was going to
acclimatise faster than this.

192
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,034
Uh.
You'll be alright.

193
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,263
Go on, critters

194
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,027
Woo.

195
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,174
- Well.
- Yeah.

196
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,832
How close did you get?

197
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:48,700
I got really close,
but...

198
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:52,096
got a lateness ,
pretty shot anyways, so...

199
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,270
I think I would have
made a run for it.

200
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:58,130
- Everyday I wake up thinking that.
- Then why didn't you do it?

201
00:12:58,155 --> 00:13:00,298
Because I turned him around.

202
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,107
1:15 (PM) of the South Summit.

203
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:05,567
That condition, we weren't going to
make that 2 PM turn around.

204
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,504
It's all good more you make
the top, Beck.

205
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:10,083
but you pay me
to bring you down safely.

206
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,701
Remember that.

207
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,352
Okay.

208
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,937
What's eating him?

209
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:28,562
One of those Sherpas is Tenzing.
He had an accident.

210
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,796
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,123
... on the icefall.

212
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:36,010
It's not good,
had to bring him down.

213
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:55,302
Tengboche Monastery : 3,867 metres

214
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:17,904
Blessing at Tengboche Monastery

215
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:33,256
Climbers Memorial, Thok La : 4,877 metres

216
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:16,817
South Base Camp Of Everest : 5,367 metres

217
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,498
Look what happens.

218
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:23,138
Yeah. Didn't take you too long
to get in on the act.

219
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,426
Got to make a living, man.

220
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,509
You... went ahead and
fixed the ice post, I see.

221
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,140
Yeah, yeah.
It's pretty messy up there this year.

222
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,684
- Yeah?
- The vasses are pretty big.

223
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,847
Strung 4 or 5 ladders across.

224
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,969
You use good ropes there, did you?

225
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:40,150
You ready?
Okay.

226
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:43,605
This is April 7th about 10:30 am

227
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:46,557
This is Sandy Hill Pittman reporting
for Nbc Interactive Media

228
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:50,447
and we are official at
Everest Base Camp.

229
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,375
- She one of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

230
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,258
Someone went and stole my journalist
so I had to get another one.

231
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:59,061
She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer, that's for sure.

232
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,857
Listen, just to be clear
I didn't steal your journalist.

233
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:02,259
Hey, man.
It's all good.

234
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:04,445
- Outside magazine gave me a call...
- Hey.

235
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,971
- They gave me a call...
- Hey!

236
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:08,094
-  said they wanted...
- It's all good.

237
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,716
they're going to sent
a journalist up the hill

238
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:12,063
and asked me if
I was interested.

239
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,370
It was his call in the end.

240
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:27,494
Alright.
Carol Mackenzie, team doctor.

241
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,095
Why don't you kick it off, Carol.

242
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,883
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Carol.

243
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,366
Hi, there.

244
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:36,294
- Hey, sorry.
- No, it's fine.

245
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,918
Um. So...
Rob and Harold and Mike

246
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,584
will tell you all sorts of stuff
about mountaineering.

247
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,822
but, from a medical stand of point,

248
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:47,274
getting into the top of Everest
was really about oxygen.

249
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,902
and the lack of it.

250
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:50,952
To give you the best chance
of summiting,

251
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:54,297
you need to prepare your bodies
for the thin air up there.

252
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:57,053
So, over the next month
before the final ascend,

253
00:16:57,078 --> 00:16:59,986
you are going to make
3 partial acclimatising ascends,

254
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:03,109
returning here, to Base Camp,
after each one.

255
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:07,480
The bad news is that each ascend
begins and ends with the icefall.

256
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:10,539
I'm sorry,
but there's no way around it.

257
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:15,343
There're millions of tons of glacier ice
continue moving day and night.

258
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:20,682
Your crevasses so deep
they probably don't have a bottom.

259
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,134
It is not a place that you want to
get caught hanging out on,

260
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,020
especially when the sun hits it.

261
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:28,567
So, we're going to be up, nice and early
and through that as soon as possible.

262
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:31,179
Now, the Sherpas are going ahead and
fixed the ladders across the crevasses

263
00:17:31,203 --> 00:17:33,835
and we've made it
as safe as we possibly can.

264
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,721
But, that is not to say
that it is completely safe.

265
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:39,391
19 people have died
in that icefall.

266
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:42,934
- Whoa whoa whoa...
- Hold on.

267
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,195
Steady.

268
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,942
- You alright, Jon?
- You alright?

269
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:51,270
- I'm good. Okay.
- Alright, steady up.

270
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:53,873
So, remember,
we're a team,

271
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,833
let's look up for each other.

272
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:58,559
 - Lookout for hypothermia.
(Camp 1 : 5,944 metres)

273
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:02,363
Things like slur speech
and irrational behaviour.

274
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:04,805
I've seen hypoxia climbers
ripped off all their clothes

275
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:07,983
at 8000 m because
they are feeling hot.

276
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,151
You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brain

277
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:16,385
to the point of lost of motor function
and eventually death.

278
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,201
And pulmonary edema, which is
your lungs filling with fluid.

279
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,438
till you furtively drown.

280
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:25,837
The only cure is to get
down the mountain fast.

281
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,450
Alright. Okay.
Alright.

282
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,931
But, it is not all doom
and gloom here, okay?

283
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:33,622
Myself and the whole AC team are here
to make sure you get up and down safely

284
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,574
and you will acclimatise naturally.

285
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:39,510
So, why don't we all
give Carol a nice big thank you.

286
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,067
- Oh, you don't have to give me that.
- It's her first time here.

287
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:42,403
- Hey.
- Alright.

288
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,093
Nice job.

289
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:48,317
23th April

290
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:54,346
Camp 2 : 6,492 metres

291
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,177
Well done.

292
00:18:56,967 --> 00:19:00,344
You want to get on the regulator
or you want to hear that

293
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:03,142
Can it get hosed.

294
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,642
Guys, go.

295
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,756
- How're you doing, darling?
- Okay.

296
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,849
- Good?
- Yeah.

297
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,740
- Well done.
- Hang in there.

298
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:14,044
In a situation like this,
you just want to catch your breath

299
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,246
go right up to 4, you should
start feeling pretty good.

300
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,452
Yeah, I can feel that already.

301
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:18,951
How did you boys go?

302
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:20,534
- Instant happiness.
- Hey.

303
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,173
- Amazing.
- Very happy.

304
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,579
- Doug, you okay?
- Huh?

305
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:31,108
When we get back to base,
I want you to...

306
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,348
get Carol to get
a look at you.

307
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:33,630
Nah, I'm alright.
I'm okay.

308
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:36,652
Then... do me a favor,
swinge another oxygen.

309
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,998
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

310
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,292
- You got enough?
- We got plenty.

311
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:41,836
Alright.

312
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:44,868
Get some tea in there.

313
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,589
Just lift your shirt up a bit.

314
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:49,140
Thank you.

315
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,276
Now, take a deep breath for me.

316
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,592
Just take one of those
in the morning

317
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,718
- with a little bit of water before breakfast.
- Okay. thanks.

318
00:20:04,923 --> 00:20:06,384
- Right, Beck. You're up.
- It's alright.

319
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,307
You're right.
Go for it.

320
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,561
Read it and weep.

321
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:13,862
Take it easy there.

322
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,704
- Right, you can stop.
- Yeah?

323
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,247
- You're in great shape, Beck.
- I'm in great shape.

324
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,340
- Yeah.
- 6 days a week in the gym

325
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:25,601
- ought to do it.
- Your wife must have love that.

326
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,598
Yeah, she does.

327
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:30,382
Oh no.
What's the date today?

328
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:32,888
- April 25th.
- No.

329
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,773
No...

330
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,628
Need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?

331
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:45,000
You might want to look at this one first,
came in for you last night.

332
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:49,666
Happy Anniversary Beck
- Peach.

333
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:50,830
Oh, Lord.

334
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,118
What?

335
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:54,861
Can I-Can I use your satphone?

336
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:58,430
Woo. This came in last night,
it is an emergency?

337
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:00,864
- It's...  25 bucks a minute, Beck.
- Yeah, fine.

338
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:03,977
- No. This one is on us.
- Seriously.

339
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,539
Thanks.

340
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:08,369
Rob.

341
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,123
- Beck?
- Peach, it's me.

342
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,651
What happened?

343
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:15,777
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm fine.

344
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:18,118
Where-Where are you?

345
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,175
I'm at Base Camp right now.

346
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,194
You're calling me from Everest?

347
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,911
Yeah, it's a satellite phone, honey.

348
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:27,114
Oh my god.
How much is that costing?

349
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:30,857
- What's the problem?
- There is no problem, Peach.

350
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,704
I'm sorry, we were
up at Camp 2 and

351
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,998
that's why I didn't send
you a fax yesterday.

352
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:41,644
Happy anniversary.
Okay.

353
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,201
- Get off.
- Mom.

354
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:45,825
- How're the kids?
- Fine.

355
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,311
- Hey.
- Peach.

356
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,572
- Get off.
- Bud's here.

357
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:53,087
Doing his homework
in the morning as per usual.

358
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,587
You want to say hi to him?

359
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,897
Yeah, of course I do.

360
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,068
- Hang on.
- Okay.

361
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:58,128
- Say hi.
- Hey, Dad.

362
00:21:58,153 --> 00:21:59,353
- Hey, Bud.
- Hi.

363
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:01,125
I miss you, buddy.

364
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,776
Oh.
And Meg went on her first date.

365
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,203
- Mom.
- ...last weekend. Well, you did.

366
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:08,911
- Wow. Really?
- Um-hum.

367
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:10,938
- Get off.
- Peach.

368
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:15,365
I missed you, honey.

369
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:17,611
Mom?
Mom.

370
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,615
Missed the kids...

371
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:22,980
a lot.

372
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,480
- Peach.
- Listen, I got to get the kids to school.

373
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,701
I got to run.

374
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:33,289
Okay.

375
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,042
Yeah.
Go careful.

376
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,789
Bye bye.

377
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:41,652
Is Dad okay?

378
00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:44,842
Just... he never calls.

379
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:46,319
He's...

380
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:48,815
I think he's scared.

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,101
Yeah.

384
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,410
Beck.
Come in mate, come on.

385
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,599
- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.

386
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,888
You don't dance.
You don't climb.

387
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:11,567
Come on, guys.
Beck Weathers.

388
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:13,703
- Yeah.
- Come on, Beck. Come on.

389
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:18,597

Hey, man.
Breaking into the rations?

393
00:23:29,294 --> 00:23:30,616
Yeah, you want some?

394
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,704
No. I'll...
I'll wait till we summit.

395
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:37,271
I don't know about that, Neal.

396
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:39,784
We'll get there.

397
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:41,176
I'm excited.

398
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:45,016
Anyway, me and Anatoli are here
to help you, you know.

399
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:49,694
It's too much competition.

400
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:56,038
We don't need competition
 between people.

401
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:03,805
This competition,
between every person and this mountain.

402
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:10,291
The last word always
belongs to the mountain.

403
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:26,457
Lhotse Face : 7,132 metres

404
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:36,300
- Ang Dorjee.
- Yeah!

405
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,972
Stay there, Beck.
Stay there.

406
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,364
Okay, I'm coming down.

407
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:49,959
This isn't happening, guys.

408
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:52,699
Let's turn him around.

409
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:55,398
Get him off the Face,
and back to the Base Camp

410
00:24:55,423 --> 00:24:56,580
Turn around.

411
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:59,510
- Ang Dorjee. Come on, we're going down.
- Okay.

412
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:06,412
My hand!

413
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:10,817
Okay, make a fist again.
Just kind of keep clenching

414
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,751
to keep the blood flow.

415
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,125
What's going on, man?

416
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,534
Still waiting for the south Africans.

417
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:22,386
 Carl took forever as well.

418
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:26,664
Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.

419
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,757
Yeah, yeah.
Your yak fun money is coming.

420
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:33,632
- You serious man?
- Come on. Get a move on.

421
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:42,270
- How long you're been waiting him?
- A good 45 minutes.

422
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:44,625
- Man, it's freezing.
- Yeah.

423
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,688
- Stinging, huh?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,721
- Hey, Rob, we got to get him over!
- We're working on it.

425
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,717
He's freezing, man.

426
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:54,691
- Are you set?
- Yeah.

427
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:57,536
- We're sending him over, mate.
- Go ahead.

428
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,075
Keep going, Beck.

429
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,833
Looking good.

430
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,098
- That's it.
- Now, head up, mate. Head up.

431
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:36,742
Hold on there!

432
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:38,032
- Whoaaaa.
- Pull. Pull.

433
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:40,582
Help. Help!
Help!

434
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:42,547
Beck, you alright?

435
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:44,181
- Are these ladders going to take 2.
- Yeah.

436
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,721
I'll get a rope.
I'll belay you, okay!

437
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:48,229
- Stay right where you are, mate.
- I can't pull yourself up!

438
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,593
I'm going to come after you.

439
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:53,256
Good-Good, Beck.
You're okay.

440
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:55,072
Untie these,
you got to tie me in.

441
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:56,199
Come and get me.

442
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,617
- On belay.
- Got it, on belay.

443
00:26:57,643 --> 00:26:58,952
Let's go.

444
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:01,983
I'm coming after you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.

445
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:09,816
Nice and easy,

446
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,424
- I can't feel my hands!
- Looking good.

447
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,457
Help me.

448
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:15,528
- Beck. Beck. Beck.
- Help me!

449
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:17,076
Stay right where you are, mate.

450
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,434
- Can't pull myself up.
- I'm right here. I'm here.

451
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,364
I can't pull myself up!

452
00:27:30,794 --> 00:27:32,468
You okay?

453
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,887
No guarantees to the Summit.
I get it.

454
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:40,244
I get killed because I'm waiting in line.
Like I'm in a freaking Wal-mart.

455
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,577
Not while I paid you $65,000

456
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:46,028
Now get me off of here.

457
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,657
That's it.
Plant your feet, one at a time.

458
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:58,930
Alright, thanks for coming by.
(Meeting for guides, organizers)

459
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:02,162
Look. Base Camp as you know
is chalked up all this year, so...

460
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:04,390
I think it'll
all benefit us greatly

461
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:06,189
by coming together like this
and you know,

462
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:08,175
working out some kind
of plan and schedule.

463
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:10,788
- What, like some kind of rotor?
- Yes.

464
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,517
On Everest.

465
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:17,146
Everyone knows Everest is a business for you,
but, Rob, are you kidding?

466
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,765
What gives you the right to tell us
when we can climb and when we can't.

467
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:21,872
I'm not telling you,
I'm asking.

468
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:24,253
We know everybody is planning to summit,
for instance...

469
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:27,922
You know we can avoid the chaos
that happened at the Icefall today.

470
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:30,571
Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10th.

471
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:31,866
So are we, man.

472
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:34,292
- Us too.
- May 10th.

473
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:39,183
Okay, that's bumper to bumper traffic
on the Hillary step.

474
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:40,492
Yes it is, that's my point.

475
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,990
Look, this is ridiculous.
We summiting when we want.

476
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,990
Alright. And I don't need
your permission to climb the mountain.

477
00:28:48,015 --> 00:28:49,882
Ian, have you seen how
many people here

478
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:51,006
- ... at Base Camp this year.
- We're finish here.

479
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,930
- Come on, lads.
- Hey, man.

480
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,252
Ah.
Come in, man.

481
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:12,644
- Hi.
- Ha ha.

482
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,096
- Have a drink, Rob.
- Yeah, have a drink.

483
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,507
Na zdorovye. (*To health.)

484
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:19,000
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)

485
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:21,719
- With a word. Yeh.
- Um-hum.

486
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:29,644
- You're a little crook, huh.
- I know, it's just a little.

487
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,307
- A little touch of the deli belly.
- He means Buddha belly.

488
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,153
What's going on Roberto?

489
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:50,788
I don't like the look of the
crowds on the ropes.

490
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:54,508
We will run into some trouble
once we're above Camp 3.

491
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:57,250
- Well. You want the top of number 10, yeah?
- Yeah.

492
00:29:57,276 --> 00:29:58,813
So do I.

493
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:02,307
What're you saying,
we should team up?

494
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:04,611
Well, it's an idea, yeah.

495
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:07,815
Oh, man.

496
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:14,362
Oh, I don't know, man.
We have different styles, man. Like...

497
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,090
All due respect,
you're a hand holder.

498
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,650
I mean the best, but...

499
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:21,991
I just believe that if you can't
get up there yourself

500
00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:24,477
you shouldn't be on
the mountain at all.

501
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:27,270
You guide your team,
I guide my.

502
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:30,626
I'm just suggesting that we work
with each other instead of against.

503
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:34,051
The only way we both summit, mate,
is that we work together.

504
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:36,555
Particularly fixing the ropes.

505
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:39,082
It's got to make sense.

506
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:43,288
Ah.

507
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:47,118
Why not.

508
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:50,765
- Oh Yeah.
- Yeah, I see the sense in it.

509
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,015
Okay then.

510
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,467
- Thanks, Scott.
- Alright.

511
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:57,272
Who's going to lead
when we get up there.

512
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,345
Rob, if I say I want to lead,
could it be done?

513
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,219
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Okay, hey.

514
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:14,570
You got to work with Ang Dorjee.
'cause we're working together now.

515
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:19,795
He's just saying if both of us...
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

516
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:21,608
Okay.

517
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:23,675
Ang Dorjee.

518
00:31:25,186 --> 00:31:26,541
We're all professionals here.

519
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,211
We work together and
we get the job done.

520
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:30,082
- Yes?
- Alright, yeah.

521
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:33,001
We're planning of stashing,
what 8 bottles of "O"

522
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:34,338
 over the South Summit.

523
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:36,681
- Well, I'm not using "O".
- What do you mean?

524
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:38,721
- You're not using oxygen at all?
- Come on man, you know you want it.

525
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:40,432
In his care, don't need it.

526
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:43,015
Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

527
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,248
You have people's lives in your hands.
It's your job.

528
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:48,057
Never used it.
Never will.

529
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:50,855
Bigger problems if you run out.

530
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:52,924
Okay.

531
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,638
I'll put some more bottles
over up there.

532
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,807
- You know, that would be good.
- Alright.

533
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:58,342
Just as long as you guys are clear.

534
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:01,123
You work for me you use oxygen,
otherwise you don't work for me.

535
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:02,432
Hey, you don't have to ask me.

536
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:05,876
I've been up here before without "O"s, Rob.
I don't need to deal with clients.

537
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:08,065
- Alright. Next we have the fixed ropes.
- Yeah.

538
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:10,984
Particularly, above the Lhotse Face.

539
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,727
You let us start
make new fixed rope.

540
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,642
- And Southeast Ridge as well.
- Yes, it does.

541
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,811
Well. My idea is that
we work together

542
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:19,154
and we fix ropes together,
we share the duties.

543
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,373
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

544
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,958
Alright, you and Lopsang
maybe get together,

545
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,096
talk about who want to
fix what and where, okay?

546
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,020
Ah.
Only essentials.

547
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:30,260
I'm not going to tell you what to pack,
but be brutal, okay.

548
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:33,259
1 pint down here
is like 10 up there.

549
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:36,522
Light and fast.
Light and fast.

550
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:40,570
What, and just like that
you-you killed my summit cappuccino.

551
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,413
Go go go.
Run.

552
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:46,060
That camera is totally daine.
( 5th May )

553
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:48,329
Alright, it's going to be a tough week.
( 5th May )

554
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:51,685
But, it's going to be the
best Friday of your lives.

555
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,998
Hey, what-what are we
doing in a boat?

556
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:56,601
- Summiting!
- Summiting!
- Summiting...!

557
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:00,711
- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yeah, you.

558
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:01,742
 I take 3.

559
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,580
- It's from Jan.
- You can't look at my card.

560
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:07,625
I knew it was
going to be a girl.

561
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,722
I can't believe it.

562
00:33:09,748 --> 00:33:11,084
It's a girl!

563
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:14,172
- Yeah!
- That's great.

564
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:15,657
Alright, good on you.

565
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:18,046
I know. I knew.
I knew she was.

566
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,765
- Thank you. Thank you, Doug.
- Cheers, mate.

567
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,423
When is she due?

568
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:23,998
Mid July.
As soon as I get back.

569
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:27,371
- You can't leave now, buddy.
- Yeah, that's true.

570
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,928
Hey, Rob.

571
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:30,367
 Yeah?

572
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:32,238
Jan doesn't mind you being here?

573
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:35,806
Oh oh.
Krakauer's sword is unleashed.

574
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,417
It's okay. I'm...
Jan's a climber, Jon. She gets it.

575
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:40,410
- Oh yeah?
- She is, Helen.

576
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:41,824
Now you, Doug.
What about your wife?

577
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:44,885
Oh, she's been fine with it
ever since we divorced.

578
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,064
- She's been great with everything since then.
- I'm so sorry, buddy.

579
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:49,590
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:51,229
No no no.
I asked because

581
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:54,644
Peach said to me, "If you climb 1 more mountain,
I will divorce you."

582
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,410
And you went ahead
and then booked this trip.

583
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,309
- Oh.
- Ow...

584
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:01,291
No no no. The worst-
The worst part of it is that, I...

585
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:04,132
I kind of forgot to tell her.

586
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:06,567
- No.
- Ha ha ha.

587
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,527
I forgot to tell her.
I did.

588
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:11,422
Alright.
It's all on the table here.

589
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:14,085
It hurts. It's dangerous.
It...

590
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,369
destroys relationships.
It's costing you all a small fortune.

591
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:19,007
- Were there any negative aspects?
- Yeah.

592
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:21,838
Come on, I got to ask the question.
You know I do.

593
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,715
Why?

594
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,771
Why?

595
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:28,527
Because

596
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:31,021
- Because it's there!
- It's there!
- It's there!

597
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:33,108
That's why.
Thank you Mr. Mallory.

598
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:35,661
Come on, guys,
I'm-I'm serious.

599
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:37,150
- Yasuko.
- Huh?

600
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,286
Why are you climbing Everest?

601
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:40,965
Uh.

602
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:43,246
I'm 47 years old.

603
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:45,641
I have reached 6 of the 7 summits.

604
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:50,472
So. Of course, now I have to
reach the 7th.

605
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,688
- It's not an answer.
- Oh.

606
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:53,565
Why...
No, why any summits?

607
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,088
- Well. I...
- Doug.

608
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:57,717
Why?

609
00:34:58,315 --> 00:35:00,465
- Come on. Tell him about the kids.
- What.

610
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:01,786
- Tell him about the kids.
- Yeah.

611
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,056
- Oh. I...
- You have kids?

612
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:06,829
Yeah, I have kids.
But...

613
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,119
I thought I told you their's...
their elementary school back home...

614
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:13,293
I've been going and talking
to the kids there and they

615
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:16,543
actual helped me raised some
of the money to come and...

616
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:19,711
gave me a flag to plant
on the Summit and...

617
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:23,135
so, I was thinking maybe it's...

618
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:29,210
they see an...a regular guy can,
you know, follow impossible dreams.

619
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:33,594
Maybe they will be inspired to
do the same, I guess.

620
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm climbing Mount Everest
because I can.

621
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:45,856
Because, to be able to climb that high and
see that kind of beauty nobody ever sees,

622
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:49,132
it'll be a crime not to.

623
00:35:50,577 --> 00:35:51,664
Yeh yeh, Dougy.

624
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:53,965
- There you go.
- I like that.

625
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:00,217
Hello.

626
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,876
Hey.
Did I wake you?

627
00:36:03,173 --> 00:36:04,795
No.

628
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:07,489
I did to, you liar.

629
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,632
- You okay?
- Yeah.

630
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:15,936
Yeah yeah, I'm good.
I'm better. I'm better now.

631
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:18,059
I missed you.

632
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,420
We go for the final ascend tomorrow.

633
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,413
Oh. So, you're...
you summit on Friday?

634
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:26,376
Yeah.
10th.

635
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:30,213
- It's your lucky day.
- It is.

636
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,900
How's the weather?

637
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,918
It's good.

638
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:36,112
Yeah, I think we're going to
get a good window.

639
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:40,278
- So... It's a girl.
- Oh yeah.

640
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,965
And, did you go to the doctor?
Did you get your scan done?

641
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:45,646
- Did you see her?
- Yes, we're good.

642
00:36:47,494 --> 00:36:50,318
And?
Come on, what does she look like?

643
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:53,271
Oh, you know.
Blonde hair, nice smile.

644
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,682
Perfect height-weight ratio,
she's going to be a great climber.

645
00:36:58,326 --> 00:37:02,168
She's here, Rob...
already.

646
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:05,070
- Wow.
- Me and you.

647
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:07,329
And a little bear, huh.

648
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:10,173
And in one day,

649
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,219
you,
me,

650
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,653
and our little Sarah, we'll all
go climbing together. Huh.

651
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,559
Sarah?

652
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:20,918
Yeah.
What do you think?

653
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:23,043
- No way.
- Come on.

654
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:25,501
- No.
- Please, think about it.

655
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:27,518
- No.
- Huh.

656
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:35,112
- You're still there?
- Of course I'm still here.

657
00:37:37,817 --> 00:37:39,494
I love you.

658
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,788
I love you too.

659
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,692
Sleep well, my love.

660
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:50,048
Alright.
Bye.

661

* Everest climbers
Puja blessing ceremony

662
00:38:38,972 --> 00:38:41,400
- I need to take him down.
- Yeah.

663
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:43,572
You can't get Scott on the radio?

664
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:46,538
No.
No, I think he's-he's up ahead.

665
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:58,291
Best not to stay
too long at the Summit.

666
00:38:58,317 --> 00:39:00,427
It's a long way to go, man.

667
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:06,204
Head down,
one step at a time.

668
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:08,291
You got it, boss.

669
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,367
You seen Dale?

670
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,327
Yeah, and he wasn’t looking too good,
but...

671
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:18,579
Neal seem to have
handle the situation.

672
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:19,963
Try to use your radio.

673
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:22,329
- You kidding me.
- No.

674
00:39:22,648 --> 00:39:25,043
Guess it's not working, huh.

675
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:27,422
I'm going down to Camp 1.

676
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:29,400
If he's not doing so well,
I'm going to take him down to Base Camp.

677
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:30,768
and I'll head back up.

678
00:39:30,793 --> 00:39:33,626
- You guys alright?
- Yeah.

679
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,646
He can't be too far
ahead of you, mate.

680
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,452
Yeah.
I'll make it down in half the time.

681
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,556
I'm going to catch you.
Woo.

682
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:46,023
Woo.
I'll catch you.

683
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:49,190
Cheers, mate.

686
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:03,615
- Rob to Guy. Are you there, mate?
(MOUNT PUMORI, 8 KM WEST OF EVEREST)

687
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:06,309
- Guy to Rob. I'm here.
(MOUNT PUMORI, 8 KM WEST OF EVEREST)

688
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:09,855
Good to hear you, Guy.
Where are you?

689
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,039
Camp 1, Pumori.

690
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:13,972
Yeah.

691
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:16,722
There you go,

692
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:19,849
Listen, I think you're on the
wrong mountain there.

693
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:22,130
Look, I can't talk and
we got to get out of here.

694
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:25,641
Alright, mate. Oh, listen.
You take care on the kiddy slope.

695
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,626
I ought to get back
 to the real thing.

696
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,431
Hey, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.

697
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,938
Aye!
Watch out!

698
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:44,139
Aw!

699
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:46,914
ROB!

700
00:40:46,938 --> 00:40:49,099
- Rob!
- I got you.

701
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:01,112
Harold, you okay?

702
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,235
Is everyone okay?

703
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,992
We're okay!

704
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:14,862
Come here, come here, come here.
Sit. Sit down, sit.

705
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:16,559
I'm fine.

706
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,326
Look at me.

707
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,572
- Look at me!
- I'm fine, mate.

708
00:41:20,597 --> 00:41:21,755
Look at me, Harold.

709
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,586
Look.
I'm tell you, I'm alright.

710
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:25,574
- Okay.
- I'm alright.

711
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:29,248
- Harold.
- Thank you.

712
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:31,347
Don't do that to me again, aye.

713
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,326
Rob, I'm sorry.

714
00:41:35,197 --> 00:41:36,485
Okay, mate.

715
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,541
I'll get drop back with Frank's,
you start with him, alright?

716
00:41:39,637 --> 00:41:41,932
- Alright.
- Alright.

717
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,199
- Alright. Straight here.
(Camp 3 : 7,315 metres)

Let's get him on the oxygen.

719

Bravo to Scott Fischer.
Bravo to Scott Fischer.

Mountain Madness, have you copy?

721
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:55,340
Hey, man.
Scott here.

722
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:58,333
I've been down to Base Camp
and I'm back to Camp 1.

723
00:41:58,358 --> 00:41:59,702
I'll catch you tomorrow.

724
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,445
What? You not going to
rest up a day first, huh?

725
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:07,523
Scott, you sound a little rough.
Hey, take an extra day.

726
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:10,724
No way, Jose.
What, missing out on all the fun.

727
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,036
It's a lot of up and down in...
one day even for you, Scott.

728
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:17,471
You know what they say, man.

729
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:20,356
It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.

730
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:23,891
You sure you're going to be okay?

731
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,215
- Scott?
- I'll be good.

732
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,202
Just taking a shot of
dexamethasone now.

733
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:31,074
Just don't push yourself too hard.

734
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:33,211
Okay?
Over and out.

735
00:42:39,498 --> 00:42:43,117
Rob, I've just been over the Miles
to get a weather update.

736
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:47,920
It's moving fast.
It's changed course slightly

737
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:51,646
and it could still go north but
if it doesn't

738
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,112
It's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.

739
00:42:57,947 --> 00:43:00,369
Get some weather forecast, Helen.

740
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:02,556
The mountain makes it's own weather.

741
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,518
We're keeping an eye on it.

742
00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:06,858
Yeah, sure.
Just, letting you know.

743
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:08,623
Appreciate it, Helen.

744
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:13,989
Why're we doing this to ourselves?

745
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:19,755
Oh, it's crazy.

746
00:43:24,757 --> 00:43:26,978
You know I never told
Krakauer this.

747
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,690
When he was asking us
why we climb Everest.

748
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,420
When I'm at home...

749
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:35,599
I just got this big...

750
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,809
black cloud following me.

751
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,934
You know, like a depression.

752
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,681
When I'm out here...

753
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:46,143
on a mountain,
any mountain,

754
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,307
it's just like it's a cure.

755
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:53,945
Feel like I'm reborn.

756
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:56,438
So, you're happy now?

757
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,139
Now I'm starting to wonder.

758
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:04,882
This is suffering, man.

759
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:08,378
This is suffering.

760
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:10,050
Yeah.

761
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,865
Suffer a few more days.

762
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:16,840
The rest of your life, you'll be a guy
that climb to the top of Everest.

763
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:24,217
I just hope I get there.

764
00:44:25,074 --> 00:44:26,813
Yeah.

765
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:30,393
Just hope I get there
and get home.

766
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,485
What do you think, Mike?

767
00:44:41,157 --> 00:44:44,985
Almost pretty good.
A little bit of wind up high.

768
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,568
And if it picks up, we can
always come back down.

769
00:44:47,594 --> 00:44:50,327
- Exactly.
- It's your call, Rob.

770
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,050
Let's get them all going.

771
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,496
Camp 4 : 7,951 metres

772
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,233
Hey, Rob!

773
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:52,621
- You, okay?
- Not good!

774
00:45:57,911 --> 00:46:00,958
I'm hoping it's going to
die down after sun down.

775
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:02,831
Been doing that.

776
00:46:03,105 --> 00:46:04,659
I don't like this.

777
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:07,876
We don't go
if it doesn't calm.

778
00:46:08,074 --> 00:46:12,030
- I talk to Scott when he come's here.
- Okay.

779
00:46:24,425 --> 00:46:25,677
Scott!

780
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:28,719
- Scott!
- Anatoli, here.

781
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:41,938
Anatoli, where is Rob?

782
00:46:41,963 --> 00:46:44,369
Where are they?
Did he go down?

783
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:48,431
Where's Rob?
What's Rob's team doing?

784
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:52,056
Rob will see
if it passes.

785
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:54,675
If he wait.

786
00:46:57,195 --> 00:47:00,034
- We wait.
- Okay.

787
00:47:01,353 --> 00:47:04,280
Friday, 10th May

788
00:47:13,503 --> 00:47:15,322
Hey, guys.

789
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:17,610
Come out and take a look.

790
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:34,177
At least somebody up there loves us.

791
00:47:34,202 --> 00:47:35,887
Lovely.

792
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:41,226
Where did the storm go?

793
00:47:41,797 --> 00:47:43,514
Exactly.

794
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:47,856
- That's crazy.
- You ready to saddle up?

795
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:52,222
Okay, everyone.

796
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:54,175
We got a window.

797
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:56,427
We don't know how long
it's going to last.

798
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:58,702
But we're going to go for it.

799
00:47:58,865 --> 00:48:00,887
Be ready in half an hour.

800
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,389
We have a 2 PM turn around.
Let's climb this thing.

801
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:04,932
Okay.

802
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:11,436
So, today's the day, huh?

803
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:13,295
Yeah.

804
00:48:14,753 --> 00:48:16,523
Now or never.

805
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:21,322
Oh boy.

806
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,918
The south Africans were
laid out at Camp 3.

807
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:29,222
They never made it into Camp 4.

808
00:48:29,248 --> 00:48:30,914
But we got caught up in it.

809
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,199
- Maybe it blew though early.
- Yeah. Well, it hit us all night.

810
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:38,074
But that was nothing,
absolutely nothing.

811
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,467
So, it's definitely worth a shot.

812
00:48:40,492 --> 00:48:43,608
I'll radio Ed,
tell him you're continuing.

813
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,233
Any messages?

814
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:49,447
Yeah. Ring Jan, tell her that
we're heading out.

815
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:52,800
I'll call you, Helen, in 12 hours
when we get to the Summit.

816
00:48:52,824 --> 00:48:54,782
Turn around is 2 PM.

817
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,724
Good luck and
god speed to you all.

818
00:48:56,748 --> 00:48:58,590
Okay. Thank, Helen.
Bye bye.

819
00:48:58,614 --> 00:48:59,916
I'll see you guys up there.

820
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:01,257
- Take it easy, Scott.
- Let's do it.

821
00:49:01,282 --> 00:49:03,273
I'll get a couple of hours of sleep
and I'll be right behind you.

822
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:04,653
- Yeah, okay.
- See you at the top.

823
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:07,396
- Have fun, Pittman. Yeah.
- You get some rest, okay.

824
00:49:07,422 --> 00:49:08,565
See you there.

825
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:11,545
- You got the ropes for the Hillary Step?
- Yeah.

826
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,898
- Okay.
- Okay.

827
00:49:12,923 --> 00:49:14,496
Okay.

828
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:27,519
The Balcony : 8,412 metres

829
00:49:27,545 --> 00:49:30,581
04:30 AM

830
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,132
Can we go any faster?

831
00:49:33,157 --> 00:49:34,882
Not a chance we can
go faster here.

832
00:49:34,907 --> 00:49:38,320
It's too difficult.
This could take a while.

833
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,333
We're losing time.

834
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:57,661
This might be it.

835
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,239
I don't know.

836
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:03,041
Okay.
Guys, go in front of us.

837
00:50:03,074 --> 00:50:05,807
- Alright, Beck, let's sit you down.
- Okay.

838
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:14,570
Beck.
Look at me.

839
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:17,778
I need to send you down
with someone.

840
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:19,503
- No. I don't want to go down, Rob.
- No, you got to go down.

841
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:21,547
I don't want to go down.

842
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:26,688
Okay.

843
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:32,456
Alright, Beck.
Listen.

844
00:50:32,481 --> 00:50:34,652
You can wait here for half and hour.
Beck, listen to me.

845
00:50:34,677 --> 00:50:39,958
If it gets better by then,
join in the queue and keep going up.

846
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,990
If it doesn't get better, Beck,
I'm sorry, mate. It's over.

847
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:46,827
Sherpas are going to go and drop off the
extra oxygen on the south side while they can.

848
00:50:46,853 --> 00:50:50,081
I'm going to send one of them
down for you. Is that clear?

849
00:50:50,106 --> 00:50:52,353
- Yeah?
- Alright.

850
00:50:52,378 --> 00:50:55,525
Okay, mate.
Alright.

851
00:50:58,885 --> 00:51:00,643
God speed.

852
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:03,873
Sandy, do you want to go down?

853
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:06,530
What?
No, no way.

854
00:51:06,556 --> 00:51:08,646
Look, Lopsang, I'm going
to make it to the top.

855
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,730
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

856
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:14,331
- I'm not going back, okay?
- Okay.

857
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:18,210
The Southeast Ridge.

858
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,306
Hey, where are the ropes?

859
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,829
There is no rope.
No rope.

860
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,711
Yeah?
They should have been fixed.

861
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:33,367
Do you have more in your pack.

862
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:36,028
Lopsang has the ropes.
He's not here.

863
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:39,418
- No ropes?
- No.

864
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:41,907
Alright.
Neal.

865
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:45,177
Guy to Rob.
Listen, we got a problem here, mate.

866
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:49,009
There's no fixed ropes on the
crevasse to Hillary Step, over.

867
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:50,554
Where is Ang dorjee and Lopsang?

868
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:53,847
Yeah, I got Ang Dorjee here
but there's not sign of Lopsang.

869
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:57,902
So, me, Neal, Anatoli are going
to set some new ones, over.

870
00:51:57,927 --> 00:51:59,130
- Fine then.
- Yeah.

871
00:51:59,155 --> 00:52:01,753
- Good.
- Let's do it.

872
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:09,373
- What's going on?
- No fixed rope.

873
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:11,045
What?

874
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:41,438
That's it.

875
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:43,829
1 step at a time, Doug.

876
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:54,239
Come on, Dougy.
Deep breaths, Dougy.

877
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:56,177
- I can't, man.
- Keep it on. Keep it on.

878
00:52:56,202 --> 00:52:58,262
- Rob.
- Deep breaths, Dougy. Yeah.

879
00:52:58,286 --> 00:52:59,804
Hang on.

880
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:09,672
You can do this , Dougy.

881
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:12,496
- I know you can, pal.
- Yeah?

882
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:16,380
I don't want to see you
back here the third time, mate.

883
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,539
John.
You heading back down?

884
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:40,929
There's a hold up. There's no fixed ropes
above the South Summit.

885
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,418
Yeah.
I know, mate.

886
00:53:42,443 --> 00:53:44,382
But we are sorting that
situation out now.

887
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:46,733
Ran out of juice waiting.

888
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:49,298
God.
I'm sorry, Rob.

889
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:51,317
It's your call, pal.

890
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,777
I don't want to run out
of oxygen up there.

891
00:53:57,315 --> 00:53:59,063
Sorry, Rob.

892
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:07,166
We've a little bit of a set back.

893
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,364
Lou, Stuart and John Taske
just turned back, just...

894
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:12,422
just below the South Summit.

895
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:15,565
- How are the conditions so far?
- Cold and windy.

896
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:19,538
- Okay, let me know, Rob.
- Okay, Helen. Thanks, bye bye.

897
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:24,980
I hope we're not looking at another year
with no clients at the top.

898
00:54:25,353 --> 00:54:27,469
Well, if that ain't going to
move them pretty soon.

899
00:54:27,494 --> 00:54:29,614
They're out of time, aren't they?

900
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,606
Yeah.
And...

901
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:35,074
What's Jon going to say
about that in his article.

902
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:37,239
- It's Rob.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

903
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:38,342
- Guy.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

904
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:40,670
- We just lost Lou, Stuart and John Taske.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

905
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:42,840
What's going on?
What's the hold up?

906
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:44,518
Yeah, yeah, mate.
We...

907
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:48,759
We sent Anatoli and Neal
to the top of the Step

908
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,873
fixing the ropes.

909
00:54:50,981 --> 00:54:54,742
We're at the-
at the Face's Step, over.

910
00:54:56,635 --> 00:54:58,954
- So, how's Doug doing?
- Doug's just behind me.

911
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:01,255
I left him behind
to scoot forward.

912
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,193
Yeah, I got eyes on you right now.
Yep, that's me.

913
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:05,076
Let's move this

914
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:07,541
as quickly as possible, over.

915
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:11,094
We'll start moving everybody up
as soon as we get the all clear.

916
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,755
Rob to base. Rob to base, Hel.
Copy, Helen.

917
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,936
- You alright?
- Copy. Base camp to Rob.

918
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:21,617
Have you... Have you heard from Scott?
Anyone manage to find out where he is, over.

919
00:55:21,757 --> 00:55:24,684
Woo-Eee!
Yo, dude.

920
00:55:24,715 --> 00:55:27,947
Look. Where are you, mate? We got a
real logjam here at the Hillary Step, over.

921
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:30,338
- I'm more than an hour behind.
- Just chill.

922
00:55:30,362 --> 00:55:33,088
Everybody is just sitting there
using up their oxygen.

923
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:35,170
Get here as soon as you can.

924
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:39,163
- Oh my god. You okay, Beck?
- Yeah.

925
00:55:39,188 --> 00:55:43,300
Oh I got a little problem with my eyes.
You guys turning back?

926
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:45,740
There's a logjam below
the Hillary Step.

927
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:48,773
It's crazy.
Come down with us.

928
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:51,958
No, I can't.
Promise Rob I'd wait for him.

929
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:53,324
- Your call.
- I'm good.

930
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,965
See you down there.

931
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:58,335
Neal.
Andy.

932
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:00,577
Okay, Anatoli.

933
00:56:00,603 --> 00:56:02,222
I'm done.

934
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:06,784
Safe to climb.

935
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:08,181
Okay, we're climbing up.

936
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:09,465
- Hey, Mike.
- What?

937
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,373
- You mind if I go first?
- Why.

938
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:13,605
I'm running pretty low on "O".

939
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:16,860
Rob, it's Mike here.

940
00:56:16,885 --> 00:56:19,447
Eh. We have been all clear
on this end.

941
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:23,530
I'm going to stay here with Yasuko
till we got a clear line.

942
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:27,173
I'll be here till I get a visual
on Doug. Over and out

943
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:24,514
* 01:14 PM *

944
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,438
We did it.

945
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:46,260
Hey.

946
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:06,367
Thank you very much.

947
00:58:06,393 --> 00:58:08,623
Thank you, Mom.

948
00:58:20,454 --> 00:58:22,295
Yasuko.

949
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,815
- Seven.
- Seven.

950
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,443
- 7 summits.
- 7 summits.

951
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:29,744
Come here.

952
00:58:29,768 --> 00:58:34,233
I'm so proud of you, Yasuko.
So proud.

953
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:36,041
Thank you.

954
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,911
Thank you.
Thank you.

955
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:43,893
Rob to base.
Rob to base.

956
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:49,065
Rob, this is Helen.
Hello, where are you?

957
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,541
I'm at the top of Everest, Helen.
We made it.

958
00:58:51,565 --> 00:58:52,878
- Yeah.
- They did it.

959
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:54,355
Copy us, over.

960
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,224
Oh, we copy you loud and clear, Rob.
It's wonderful to hear your voice up there.

961
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:00,554
Who are you with again, Rob?

962
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,735
At the moment
I'm with Mike and Yasuko.

963
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,309
Good job, man.

964
00:59:04,335 --> 00:59:06,213
Rob, see you.
Thank you.

965
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:08,969
Jon and Kasischke have
already been and gone.

966
00:59:08,994 --> 00:59:10,914
Doug is just coming over the horizon.

967
00:59:10,938 --> 00:59:12,936
And-And what about Beck?

968
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,659
Beck was having a problem
with his eye sight.

969
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:19,927
He waited on the Southeast Ridge,
on the Balcony.

970
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:22,108
But the first three
never came back, over.

971
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:25,291
And I... I guess you'll be
leaving right away, yes?

972
00:59:25,317 --> 00:59:27,913
Moving off in a few minutes
just as soon I see Doug,

973
00:59:27,938 --> 00:59:29,744
we'll be heading back down, over.

974
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:32,711
Alright, understood.
Oh, that's terrific, Rob.

975
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:35,019
We're all keeping
our fingers cross for Doug.

976
00:59:35,045 --> 00:59:37,023
Over and out, Helen.

977
00:59:49,202 --> 00:59:51,161
- Congratulation.
- You're welcome.

978
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:54,121
Yeah, ladsy.
You did it.

979
01:00:27,815 --> 01:00:29,786
You look terrible.

980
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:34,159
My stories,
not so good, man.

981
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:37,719
- You see Doug?
- Oh, yeah. He's way way...

982
01:00:38,206 --> 01:00:40,597
way back there, man.

983
01:00:40,621 --> 01:00:43,831
Hey, Roberto.
Where're the rest of your guys.

984
01:00:43,856 --> 01:00:47,380
'Cause I'm pretty sure
my whole team

985
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:48,719
made it up, yeah.

986
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:50,552
Heh heh heh.
I saw them.

987
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:52,742
Don't worry.
I won't tell Krakauer.

988
01:00:52,768 --> 01:00:55,344
Hold on, mate.
I know it's bad, heh.

989
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:57,414
I'll give you it this year.

990
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,778
Scott, you really
don't look too good.

991
01:00:59,804 --> 01:01:01,208
- Lopsang.
- Yeah.

992
01:01:01,233 --> 01:01:03,447
Come, mate.
Let's get him down.

993
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,574
Alright.

994
01:01:11,913 --> 01:01:13,438
Let's go.

995
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:40,764
Harold.
What're you doing?

996
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:43,311
I'm just trying to
sort out the "O".

997
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:45,813
I can't find any full ones.

998
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:47,693
There's full bottles,
I saw them on the way up.

999
01:01:47,717 --> 01:01:48,797
No.

1000
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:50,603
So I pretty sure you
just running out of luck.

1001
01:01:50,628 --> 01:01:53,882
- No. They just have, they're not full.
- Harold. Listen, I saw...

1002
01:01:53,907 --> 01:01:56,960
Look, Mike.
I've checked twice, alright.

1003
01:01:57,259 --> 01:02:00,592
Yeah.
Alright, man.

1004
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:03,211
I'm going down.

1005
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:06,217
Yeah.

1006
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:13,402
03:15 PM

1007
01:02:14,391 --> 01:02:16,224
Doug. Doug.
Doug.

1008
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:18,994
- It's over, mate.
- No.

1009
01:02:19,018 --> 01:02:20,894
I' sorry.
No no no no.

1010
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,306
Doug.
You're too late, okay.

1011
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:26,644
You guys keep going, mate,
I'll catch up.

1012
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,405
Doug. Doug.
Doug, listen to me.

1013
01:02:28,431 --> 01:02:30,206
- It's way too long, it's over.
- No, it's not.

1014
01:02:30,231 --> 01:02:33,039
Now, listen to me, mate.
I'm sorry.

1015
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:35,356
But I got to turn you around.

1016
01:02:35,382 --> 01:02:36,884
Okay.

1017
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:39,405
I can do it.

1018
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:44,108
It's right here, man.
It's right here.

1019
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:47,974
I'm not coming back next year, man.
It's my last chance.

1020
01:02:51,496 --> 01:02:53,869
You got to let me do this.

1021
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:57,179
Let me do this.

1022
01:02:57,617 --> 01:02:59,318
- Okay.
- Please, Rob.

1023
01:02:59,344 --> 01:03:02,228
- Let's do it. Let's get it done.
- Yeah.

1024
01:03:02,253 --> 01:03:04,563
- Come on.
- Okay.

1025
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,179
Alright, then.

1026
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:44,262
- Beck?
- What?

1027
01:03:44,286 --> 01:03:47,425
- Are you okay?
- Who is there?

1028
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:50,721
- It's Jon.
- I'm not seeing too well, Jon.

1029
01:03:50,746 --> 01:03:52,728
Fre-Freezing.

1030
01:03:53,646 --> 01:03:55,663
Mike's just behind me.

1031
01:03:55,688 --> 01:03:57,621
He's back there with Yasuko.

1032
01:03:57,646 --> 01:04:00,927
You'll be okay.
Mike's right behind me.

1033
01:04:00,952 --> 01:04:02,735
You okay?

1034
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,572
I'll see you then.

1035
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:12,070
There she is.

1036
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:14,097
Almost there, mate.

1037
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:17,891
Dig deep, Doug.
Dig deep.

1038
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,552
There you go.

1039
01:04:30,672 --> 01:04:32,706
There you go.

1040
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:36,456
Yehhhh!

1041
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:41,047
Huh, you made it.

1042
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,864
You did it.
Huh.

1043
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:50,744
Yeah.
Because of you, man.

1044
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,460
Guy to Rob.
You read me, mate?

1045
01:05:04,882 --> 01:05:07,126
Guy to Rob.
Are you there?

1046
01:05:09,637 --> 01:05:11,577
This is going to the kids.

1047
01:05:12,898 --> 01:05:15,259
Yehhh!

1048
01:05:18,306 --> 01:05:20,038
Hang in there, Doug.

1049
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:21,715
Come on.

1050
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:23,807
Easy.
Here, I got it.

1051
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:26,302
Here.
I'm okay.

1052
01:05:26,451 --> 01:05:28,085
Yeah, I got it.

1053
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:32,652
- Come on, let's get you up.
- I need...

1054
01:05:32,677 --> 01:05:33,951
- Huh?
- Need more "O".

1055
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:35,257
No, Doug.
We can't give you more "O".

1056
01:05:35,282 --> 01:05:37,755
We got to get down
to the South Summit, come on.

1057
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,275
Guy going to Everest Base Camp.
Are you there, Helen?

1058
01:05:46,505 --> 01:05:48,646
Guy, this is Helen.
How is it going?

1059
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:50,061
Yeah, I'm fine.

1060
01:05:50,086 --> 01:05:52,079
I got a clear view of the Summit
and...

1061
01:05:52,105 --> 01:05:55,396
you know, we still got climbers up there.
They are not any of ours, right?

1062
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,849
We got 3 up and
they're all on their way down.

1063
01:05:57,873 --> 01:05:59,545
Well.
What are they doing there so late?

1064
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,844
And there's 2 o'clock turn around time,
they're way past it.

1065
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:05,896
Here we go. Cloud coming out
of the valley. It's a lot of it.

1066
01:06:05,922 --> 01:06:08,346
Thanks.
I'm calling them now, Guy.

1067
01:06:11,956 --> 01:06:14,152
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1068
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:18,559
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1069
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,659
Whoa!

1070
01:06:26,684 --> 01:06:30,693
Easy. Easy. Easy, Dougy.
There you go. There you go.

1071
01:06:31,804 --> 01:06:33,940
We're going to go
around the corner.

1072
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,862
That's it.

1073
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,320
Rob, is that you?

1074
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:43,632
Beck.

1075
01:06:44,076 --> 01:06:45,458
It's Mike, mate.

1076
01:06:45,483 --> 01:06:48,244
- What're you doing here?
- I can't see, it's bad.

1077
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:49,755
You guys alright?

1078
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,293
We got a problem with Beck.

1079
01:06:51,318 --> 01:06:53,278
Hey, Mike.
We're getting low on "O".

1080
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:54,820
We got to move.

1081
01:06:54,846 --> 01:06:56,481
I'll get you to stand up, okay.

1082
01:06:56,507 --> 01:06:58,300
I'll take the...

1083
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:03,898
Has anyone got eyes
 on Ang Dorjee?

1084
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:07,905
Mate, I have just had Ang Dorjee
go past me heading down, over.

1085
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:09,641
He's going down.

1086
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:11,197
Can you stop him?
Can you turn him around?

1087
01:07:11,222 --> 01:07:12,983
I need someone
to come back up now.

1088
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:15,909
Hey!
Ang Dorjee.

1089
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:19,027
Ang Dorjee!

1090
01:07:19,052 --> 01:07:21,023
Base camp, do you copy, over.

1091
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:23,143
Helen to Rob.
Go ahead.

1092
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:24,554
Helen, please.

1093
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:27,896
I need a bottle of gas
at the top of the Hillary Step.

1094
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,902
I can't get him down without it.

1095
01:07:29,927 --> 01:07:32,048
I'm really stuck.

1096
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:33,822
Understood.

1097
01:07:33,847 --> 01:07:37,688
That you need a bottle of oxygen
at the bottom of the Hillary Step.

1098
01:07:37,713 --> 01:07:40,121
We're sending it up to you
as soon as we can.

1099
01:07:40,146 --> 01:07:43,411
At the top.
At the top.

1100
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:45,862
The last thing I said to
Ang Dorjee was please

1101
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:48,501
bring 2 bottles of gas
at the South Summit.

1102
01:07:48,525 --> 01:07:51,860
Yes, uh.
Copy that, Rob.

1103
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:55,876
Boys. There's oxygen
at the South Summit, right?

1104
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,610
No. No.
This is Harold.

1105
01:07:58,635 --> 01:08:03,072
There's no oxygen
at South Summit.

1106
01:08:03,097 --> 01:08:05,474
Repeat.
No "O".

1107
01:08:06,293 --> 01:08:09,391
Ang Dorjee stashed
4 bottles there, Harold.

1108
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,414
Harold, where are you?

1109
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:15,918
Can you hear me, Harold?

1110
01:08:16,038 --> 01:08:17,591
Harold.

1111
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:19,588
Harold, can you hear me?

1112
01:08:19,613 --> 01:08:24,060
Figure it'll take me about half an hour
to get back up to the South Summit.

1113
01:08:27,161 --> 01:08:28,713
Okay.

1114
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,577
I'm coming.

1115
01:08:32,014 --> 01:08:33,305
If you don't have oxygen, mate,

1116
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:35,252
don't come up, don't come up.
We're moving on.

1117
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,279
I'm coming up to you, Rob.

1118
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:41,337
Doug, come on, mate.
Come on!

1119
01:08:45,338 --> 01:08:49,225
Rob, this is Base Camp.
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1120
01:08:50,012 --> 01:08:51,912
I copy you, Carol.

1121
01:08:51,936 --> 01:08:54,592
Rob, can you get yourself down?

1122
01:08:55,952 --> 01:08:58,338
Carol, we're not at that point yet.

1123
01:08:58,363 --> 01:09:01,113
Rob, can you let us know
who you're with?

1124
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:03,832
I'm with Doug.

1125
01:09:03,856 --> 01:09:05,368
We're both listening.

1126
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:08,172
Come on, Dougy. Come on, mate.
One more alping, come on.

1127
01:09:08,198 --> 01:09:10,529
Rob.
What is Doug's state of consciousness?

1128
01:09:10,554 --> 01:09:12,358
He's really weak.

1129
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:15,426
He collapsed after he
ran out of oxygen.

1130
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:20,122
Okay.
Give him 8 mg of dexamethasone.

1131
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,641
That's 2 tablets, Rob.

1132
01:09:23,063 --> 01:09:24,655
Guy to Rob.

1133
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,953
Go ahead Guy.
I got you, mate.

1134
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:29,490
Rob, I suggest
you get yourself down.

1135
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:31,149
You know you're doing
no good up there.

1136
01:09:31,173 --> 01:09:32,904
And we got people we can
send up there to help Doug,

1137
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:36,202
but you got to get
yourself down, you understand?

1138
01:09:36,226 --> 01:09:38,891
I mean, come on, mate.
We're playing with a man's life here.

1139
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:41,713
There's no way I'm leaving Doug,
bellowing.

1140
01:09:43,427 --> 01:09:45,448
We got to keep moving, mate.

1141
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,172
We got to keep moving,
we are in some trouble.

1142
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:51,865
Yeah, Helen gonna... need some help.
So I'm gonna try make my way back.

1143
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,234
- Okay?
- Okay.

1144
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,586
Alright.
Go on.

1145
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,378
Hey, Scott.
Scott.

1146
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,073
You okay?

1147
01:10:12,996 --> 01:10:14,774
Lopsang.

1148
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:16,796
Lopsang.

1149
01:10:18,372 --> 01:10:20,546
I'm done, pal.

1150
01:10:21,871 --> 01:10:23,596
I'm done.

1151
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:28,747
You go...
send Anatoli.

1152
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:32,435
Send Anatoli back with some more.

1153
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,340
- Okay.
- Go.

1154
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,914
Okay.

1155
01:10:37,283 --> 01:10:40,662
I will send back, Anatoli.

1156
01:10:46,235 --> 01:10:48,248
- Let's go.
- You go down.

1157
01:10:48,274 --> 01:10:49,976
No, mate.

1158
01:10:50,002 --> 01:10:51,609
No. I'm not leaving
you behind, Doug.

1159
01:10:51,635 --> 01:10:53,270
- Come on.
- Got to rest.

1160
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:55,164
No, Doug! Come on!
Come on with me!

1161
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,002
I need 10 good minutes, Doug.
Come on.

1162
01:11:01,748 --> 01:11:03,702
Please, let me go.

1163
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:07,067
Damn it.
We're at the bottom of the Step.

1164
01:11:07,282 --> 01:11:10,811
On this leg.
This leg, Dougy, come on.

1165
01:11:11,243 --> 01:11:12,909
Come on.

1166
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:15,038
Here we go.

1167
01:11:34,355 --> 01:11:36,054
Oh no.

1168
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:37,920
Oh no.

1169
01:11:37,944 --> 01:11:40,681
Hey. Hold it down.
Hold that down.

1170
01:11:40,707 --> 01:11:43,625
Come on, come on.
Get the chairs.

1171
01:12:24,524 --> 01:12:26,270
Come on, Dougy!

1172
01:12:26,295 --> 01:12:28,827
Go, let's go!
Hurry up!

1173
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:08,097
Doug. I'm going to go to
the South Summit to get oxygen.

1174
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:11,007
Okay.
Got to find oxygen.

1175
01:13:11,033 --> 01:13:13,636
But, you got to stay here!

1176
01:13:13,819 --> 01:13:17,965
Okay, stay here!
Don't move, I'll be back!

1177
01:13:42,528 --> 01:13:44,233
Hey, Rob.

1178
01:14:23,007 --> 01:14:25,435
Hey!
Stop!

1179
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,845
That's the wrong way!

1180
01:14:29,826 --> 01:14:31,943
Turn back!

1181
01:14:48,511 --> 01:14:50,104
Easy.

1182
01:15:05,372 --> 01:15:07,042
Hey, Rob.

1183
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:09,484
Hey, Rob!

1184
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,515
Rob!

1185
01:15:23,884 --> 01:15:25,277
- I got...
- Harold?

1186
01:15:25,307 --> 01:15:27,439
I got oxygen.

1187
01:15:27,463 --> 01:15:31,963
Here.
I found some half empty ones.

1188
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:34,985
Where's Doug?

1189
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:38,087
Doug's gone.

1190
01:15:38,728 --> 01:15:40,465
What?

1191
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,907
Gone.

1192
01:15:56,314 --> 01:15:58,077
Come on!

1193
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,497
Camp 4 is that way.

1194
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:05,041
Get up!
Let's go.

1195
01:16:05,815 --> 01:16:09,064
Come on.
Beck.

1196
01:16:16,853 --> 01:16:19,548
I'll get help!

1197
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:56,385
Hey!

1198
01:16:56,823 --> 01:16:58,676
Yeah!

1199
01:17:00,253 --> 01:17:02,431
Neal!

1200
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:05,939
- Anatoli.
- Where-Where are they?

1201
01:17:05,963 --> 01:17:08,168
They're still out there.

1202
01:17:14,574 --> 01:17:17,541
Jon!
I need help!

1203
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:18,756
What?

1204
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:21,377
Get out there!
I need help!

1205
01:17:21,402 --> 01:17:23,800
I can't.
I can't see, Anatoli.

1206
01:17:23,824 --> 01:17:25,726
I'm snow blind.

1207
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:29,260
Beck.
Doug.

1208
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:32,560
They need help.
They're still out there.

1209
01:17:34,557 --> 01:17:38,502
I go find them.
You stay here.

1210
01:17:43,009 --> 01:17:45,180
12:00 AM

1211
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:54,342
Good job.

1212
01:18:07,921 --> 01:18:09,908
Hey!

1213
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:15,519
Anatoli!

1214
01:18:15,543 --> 01:18:19,103


1215
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:12,417
- Can you walk?
- I can't.

1216
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:28,307
I'll come back.

1217
01:18:28,623 --> 01:18:30,641
I'll stay!

1218
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:38,059
Give me that, come on.

1219
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:41,225
- It won't budge. It's frozen!
- Take this.

1220
01:18:42,512 --> 01:18:44,207
The gloves.

1221
01:18:45,273 --> 01:18:47,296
I'm sorry.

1222
01:18:59,216 --> 01:19:00,737
Come on, mate.

1223
01:19:01,585 --> 01:19:03,252
Come on now.

1224
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:07,469
Thanks for coming back.

1225
01:19:28,881 --> 01:19:31,296
- Hello, Base Camp.
- Helen, it's Jan.

1226
01:19:31,322 --> 01:19:34,387
Why haven't I heard from you?
Why hasn't anybody call me?

1227
01:19:34,412 --> 01:19:38,533
They've been hit by a storm, Jan.
It's really bad.

1228
01:19:39,686 --> 01:19:43,514
- Where is he?
- We don't know exactly. But...

1229
01:19:43,554 --> 01:19:45,449
He was still on the Summit at 4:00.

1230
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:48,759
Oh my.
Can he get down?

1231
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:51,756
Rob can,
but Doug can't.

1232
01:19:51,878 --> 01:19:55,198
There's at least 13 people
stranded up there and...

1233
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,774
while the storm is getting worse.

1234
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:02,314
Helen!

1235
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:06,011
Get Ang Dorjee up there.
He'll bring them down.

1236
01:20:06,298 --> 01:20:08,432
- Helen, do you understand?
- Helen. Give me an update.

1237
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:11,515
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

1238
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:13,396
Jan, yep.
We will get him.

1239
01:20:13,421 --> 01:20:16,385
And I will call you
the minute I hear from him.

1240
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:18,555
- As soon as I hear from him.
- Thanks, Helen.

1241
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:20,594
- Alright.
- Okay.

1242
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,532
- Where is he?
- Guy, I haven't heard from him.

1243
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:25,326
- Okay, I get it.
- I've been trying.

1244
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,311
- Guy.
- Just hang on, hang on.

1245
01:20:27,337 --> 01:20:29,448
Rob, it's Guy.
Where are you?

1246
01:20:29,474 --> 01:20:32,569
- Guy, I've been doing that for the last 2 hours.
- Alright. Alright.

1247
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,118
Rob, it's Guy.

1248
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:36,895
- Just keep your energy, mate.
- Helen.

1249
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:39,135
Once you catch a break, you move.
You know the drill.

1250
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:42,780
Hey, Guy. We got a stash of oxygen
on the South Col.

1251
01:20:42,822 --> 01:20:45,030
- Whoever needs it can have it.
- That's the way, thank you.

1252
01:20:45,055 --> 01:20:47,643
Faust's team are gonna go up,
they got a man to search,

1253
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:49,091
as soon as they can.

1254
01:20:49,122 --> 01:20:52,217
Anyone who is going would have
to leave at dawn.

1255
01:20:52,887 --> 01:20:54,020
That's right, David.

1256
01:20:54,045 --> 01:20:56,231
Go and let Ed knows what's going on,
I'll be right behind you.

1257
01:20:56,256 --> 01:20:57,752
Camp 4, come in.

1258
01:20:57,777 --> 01:21:00,090
Hey, Rob.  Rob, can you hear me?
( 03:00 AM )

1259
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:05,979
David Breashears has a stash of oxygen
at the South Col that we can use.

1260
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:09,557
Alright, mate. Well, we're all organizing
a team, we're coming to get you.

1261
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:34,092
Burning up.

1262
01:21:54,171 --> 01:21:55,929
No.
No.

1263
01:21:56,989 --> 01:21:58,636
Yasuko.

1264
01:21:59,685 --> 01:22:01,650
Ohhh.

1265
01:22:01,675 --> 01:22:03,507
Andy

1266
01:22:10,072 --> 01:22:11,853
Come on!

1267
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:10,439
Rob, talk to me, please. Pick up.
( Saturday, 11th May )

1268
01:23:14,358 --> 01:23:17,550
- Pick up, mate. Please
( 05:00 AM )

1269
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:46,617
Was there any word from the others?

1270
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:51,377
Anatoli managed to get 3 climbers back
from the South Col last night. But...

1271
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:54,054
Beck and Yasuko
are still out there.

1272
01:23:54,086 --> 01:23:58,292
They try another search but everyone
who's been up there is exhausted.

1273
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:02,686
- Base.
- Rob, is that you?

1274
01:24:03,564 --> 01:24:06,537
Rob, where are you?
We're sending people for you.

1275
01:24:07,618 --> 01:24:09,673
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1276
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:18,578
Can't move anymore.
Can't move anymore

1277
01:24:19,484 --> 01:24:21,311
Hey, mate. Yeah, I know.
I know, mate. I know.

1278
01:24:21,337 --> 01:24:23,423
You got to keep on moving.

1279
01:24:23,448 --> 01:24:25,306
Hands...

1280
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:28,760
Can't feel my hands,
they're frozen.

1281
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:33,744
There's "D" ice on the ice.

1282
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:36,314
I got "D" ice in my mask.

1283
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:38,886
That's good. You got to get
that mask working. You got to.

1284
01:24:38,911 --> 01:24:40,434
The sun's going to come up
and...

1285
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,779
you know you can get warmer
and you can get moving.

1286
01:24:42,804 --> 01:24:44,828
- Guy.
- Yeah.

1287
01:24:44,853 --> 01:24:46,167
Guy.

1288
01:24:46,192 --> 01:24:48,891
Harold was here.
Where did he go?

1289
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,476
Rob.
Is Doug with you?

1290
01:24:54,868 --> 01:24:58,048
Doug.
Doug's gone.

1291
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:02,122
Harold is gone.

1292
01:25:05,055 --> 01:25:07,689
Harold needed a little help.

1293
01:25:08,756 --> 01:25:10,838
Okay.
Rob, you got to get yourself down.

1294
01:25:10,863 --> 01:25:12,520
Where are you?

1295
01:25:17,511 --> 01:25:19,237
Guy.

1296
01:25:19,261 --> 01:25:21,712
I'm in the...
in the little...

1297
01:25:21,738 --> 01:25:24,966
in the little deep just below
the South Summit.

1298
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:26,820
Alright, you can do this.

1299
01:25:26,845 --> 01:25:29,182
You just go to, you know,
pull yourself out of that deep,

1300
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,422
and slide the rest of the way.

1301
01:25:31,448 --> 01:25:33,546
Guy, send them boys.

1302
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:37,520
Okay.
I'm going to need a little help.

1303
01:25:37,546 --> 01:25:40,703
I got some Sheapas coming
up there with 3 oxygen.

1304
01:25:40,728 --> 01:25:42,485
You just got to
come on down, mate.

1305
01:25:42,511 --> 01:25:44,557
Aye, come on down.

1306
01:25:46,306 --> 01:25:47,818
Rob.

1307
01:25:52,551 --> 01:25:54,707
Can you patch Jan through?

1308
01:25:54,731 --> 01:25:57,399
- To what?
- Pat-Patch her through.

1309
01:25:57,423 --> 01:25:59,243
Let's-Let's just try it.
Let's just...

1310
01:25:59,268 --> 01:26:02,729
put the satphone next to the radio
and uh.

1311
01:26:02,755 --> 01:26:05,935
If anyone can motivate him
to move, then Jan will.

1312
01:26:07,155 --> 01:26:08,719
Guy to Rob.

1313
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:10,603
Guy to Rob.

1314
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:15,958
Guy to Rob.
Can you read me?

1315
01:26:21,354 --> 01:26:23,804
- Rob, are you there?
- We're getting him now.

1316
01:26:26,076 --> 01:26:27,962
Rob, this is Helen.

1317
01:26:29,899 --> 01:26:31,518
Copy.

1318
01:26:31,725 --> 01:26:34,856
Rob, I got Jan for you.

1319
01:26:36,354 --> 01:26:38,108
My Jan?

1320
01:26:38,132 --> 01:26:39,462
Yeah. She's just here.

1321
01:26:39,488 --> 01:26:41,907
- Jan, you're on.
- Okay.

1322
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,096
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

1323
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,466
Hi, my love.

1324
01:26:50,492 --> 01:26:51,639
I'm a bit

1325
01:26:51,663 --> 01:26:53,807
a bit cold.

1326
01:26:54,069 --> 01:26:55,985
My love, I'm okay.

1327
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:57,838
I know you are.

1328
01:26:57,863 --> 01:27:00,501
But the sun will warm you soon.

1329
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:04,905
Sweetheart.
You got to get moving.

1330
01:27:05,069 --> 01:27:07,445
You got to come on down.

1331
01:27:08,269 --> 01:27:10,409
My hands...

1332
01:27:12,787 --> 01:27:14,582
frozen.

1333
01:27:15,868 --> 01:27:16,993
My...

1334
01:27:17,493 --> 01:27:20,113
My feet are frozen.

1335
01:27:20,518 --> 01:27:24,293
We're sending people up to you
with tea and "O"s

1336
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:27,595
But, you got to get moving, Rob.
Can you hear me?

1337
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:30,219
You got to get
your circulation going.

1338
01:27:30,243 --> 01:27:32,350
Okay, my love.

1339
01:27:32,503 --> 01:27:35,914
You do it.
Do it right now!

1340
01:27:38,226 --> 01:27:39,998
I love you.

1341
01:27:40,863 --> 01:27:42,917
Over and out.

1342
01:27:52,515 --> 01:27:54,333
Come on, Rob.

1343
01:28:44,206 --> 01:28:46,426
We can't carry them.

1344
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,753
That's not possible.

1345
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:51,502
He's good.

1346
01:28:52,809 --> 01:28:54,742
It's going to take all of your...

1347
01:28:54,766 --> 01:28:56,952
just to get ourselves down.

1348
01:28:59,207 --> 01:29:01,202
Oh, damn it.

1349
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:08,421
Helen, it's Mike here.
Do you copy?

1350
01:29:09,265 --> 01:29:11,060
Come in, Mike.
What do you got?

1351
01:29:11,085 --> 01:29:13,890
Yasuko and Beck,

1352
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:16,476
did not make it back to camp.

1353
01:29:20,917 --> 01:29:23,586
Okay, Mike.
Thanks for letting us know.

1354
01:29:58,485 --> 01:29:59,993
Meg.

1355
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:04,104
Bud.

1356
01:30:36,695 --> 01:30:39,048
Hello, Base Camp.
Hello, Base Camp.

1357
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:40,890
Hello, Base Camp.

1358
01:30:41,733 --> 01:30:43,591
Ang Dorjee, this is Helen.

1359
01:30:43,617 --> 01:30:45,865
We have to turn back!

1360
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:49,045
There is a very bad storm again.

1361
01:30:49,814 --> 01:30:51,895
- Your call, Ang Dorjee.
- Sorry.

1362
01:30:51,921 --> 01:30:55,060
We'll try it again,
when the storm pass.

1363
01:30:55,086 --> 01:30:57,266
We'll leave some tea
and oxygen here.

1364
01:30:57,292 --> 01:30:58,841
Sorry.

1365
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:08,097
We have to tell Rob
they're not coming.

1366
01:31:09,243 --> 01:31:10,753
Okay.

1367
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:20,845
Hey, Rob.
It's Guy, mate.

1368
01:31:20,869 --> 01:31:22,466
Guy.

1369
01:31:24,222 --> 01:31:28,020
Can't stop shaking, Guy.

1370
01:31:28,289 --> 01:31:31,203
Boys hit a bit of a high wind.
And...

1371
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:34,215
your best shot is going
to be to get lower.

1372
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,381
Let me think about it.

1373
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:44,670
Don't think I can hang out
here another night.

1374
01:31:49,579 --> 01:31:52,204
Which will I get first thing, okay.

1375
01:33:00,847 --> 01:33:02,078
Helen?

1376
01:33:02,104 --> 01:33:03,483
Yeah.

1377
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:06,016
Yeah, he's still there.

1378
01:33:07,009 --> 01:33:09,716
He's just below the South Summit.

1379
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:12,756
He's got oxygen
but...

1380
01:33:12,782 --> 01:33:14,733
it's iced up.

1381
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:17,686
We don't know whether
he's been able to free it.

1382
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:22,073
Is anybody with him?

1383
01:33:22,099 --> 01:33:23,618
No.

1384
01:33:24,038 --> 01:33:25,546
No.

1385
01:33:26,243 --> 01:33:29,640
You have to get him down before dark.
He won't survive another night.

1386
01:33:29,765 --> 01:33:31,382
We know.

1387
01:33:32,631 --> 01:33:36,302
But the storms come back,
real bad.

1388
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:39,783
We can't get anyone
up to him tonight.

1389
01:33:39,807 --> 01:33:41,679
We tried.

1390
01:33:45,006 --> 01:33:47,451
He might as well be on the moon.

1391
01:33:50,184 --> 01:33:51,426
Uh.

1392
01:33:53,373 --> 01:33:55,728
Can you put me on
with him again?

1393
01:33:55,752 --> 01:33:57,572
Of course.

1394
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,936
Guy.
Get Rob.

1395
01:34:07,024 --> 01:34:08,965
Hi, Rob.
It's Guy.

1396
01:34:09,948 --> 01:34:12,108
I've got Jan for you.

1397
01:34:12,681 --> 01:34:14,145
Hold on.

1398
01:34:14,635 --> 01:34:16,476
Give me a second.

1399
01:34:30,853 --> 01:34:32,657
Okay.

1400
01:34:41,078 --> 01:34:43,373
Hi, sweetheart.

1401
01:34:44,029 --> 01:34:46,211
How are you?

1402
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:50,884
I'm thinking about you.

1403
01:34:54,737 --> 01:34:56,729
Please say, "I'm good."

1404
01:34:58,939 --> 01:35:01,217
Are you warm, my love.

1405
01:35:01,891 --> 01:35:04,742
I might have a little frostbite.

1406
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,761
I'm looking forward
to making it all better.

1407
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:15,181
I'm waiting for you
to come home.

1408
01:35:17,902 --> 01:35:20,225
How's Sarah?

1409
01:35:20,305 --> 01:35:22,029
Sarah?

1410
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:24,515
Yeah.

1411
01:35:25,596 --> 01:35:27,884
Yes, Sarah is good.

1412
01:35:29,381 --> 01:35:32,088
Will you call her that for me?

1413
01:35:32,365 --> 01:35:34,256
Yes, I will.

1414
01:35:36,837 --> 01:35:40,270
I don't think I'm going
to get to meet her.

1415
01:35:43,353 --> 01:35:46,011
I'm so sorry.

1416
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:52,153
Don't say that.

1417
01:35:54,006 --> 01:35:56,756
If anyone can make it, you can.

1418
01:35:56,782 --> 01:35:58,421
Remember.

1419
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:04,154
I love you.

1420
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:08,666
Please don't worry too much.

1421
01:36:14,395 --> 01:36:17,038
Good bye, my love.

1422
01:36:30,141 --> 01:36:32,596
I love you, Rob.

1423
01:36:36,087 --> 01:36:37,912
I love you.

1424
01:38:20,692 --> 01:38:24,359
(Come on.)
(Come on.)

1425
01:38:37,869 --> 01:38:40,188
(Come on, Dad.)

1426
01:40:01,626 --> 01:40:03,288
Beck.

1427
01:40:06,335 --> 01:40:08,543
Helen, it's Mike here.

1428
01:40:08,689 --> 01:40:10,911
Helen, do you copy?

1429
01:40:10,935 --> 01:40:12,737
Mike, come in.

1430
01:40:12,761 --> 01:40:14,586
Beck's still alive.

1431
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:16,748
He walked himself into camp.

1432
01:40:16,774 --> 01:40:19,219


1433
01:40:07,243 --> 01:40:10,162
I got to get him down to Camp 1.

1434
01:40:23,501 --> 01:40:25,381
Thanks, Mike.

1435
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:33,259
We don't even know how,
but he is alive.

1436
01:40:33,529 --> 01:40:35,173
Thing is, Peach,

1437
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:36,949
we can't get him down the Icefall.

1438
01:40:36,975 --> 01:40:38,426
Oh no.
I'll get him down.

1439
01:40:38,452 --> 01:40:40,645
- I'll get him down. Okay.
- Dad.

1440
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:43,668
Okay, what do we need?
We need a helicopter, right?

1441
01:40:43,694 --> 01:40:48,662
Yeah, but they can't a helicopter up
that high because the air is too thin.

1442
01:40:48,686 --> 01:40:51,658
We should try, but it is
one heck of a rescue.

1443
01:40:51,684 --> 01:40:53,545
And he's not in a
 good way, Peach.  So...

1444
01:40:53,569 --> 01:40:56,498
I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

1445
01:41:01,335 --> 01:41:03,131
1 step at a time.

1446
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,601
- You got to keep moving.
- I'm tired.

1447
01:41:07,627 --> 01:41:09,059
- I know.
- I'm tired.

1448
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:11,496
I know you are.
I know you are. Come on.

1449
01:41:13,207 --> 01:41:15,097
Slow and steady.

1450
01:41:16,481 --> 01:41:18,606
Come on, keep moving.

1451
01:41:18,967 --> 01:41:23,567
Yes, I like the number of the
American Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal.

1452
01:41:23,721 --> 01:41:24,840
Yes, Nepal.

1453
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,389
Ambassador, please.
No. Sweets, I can't hold.

1454
01:41:27,413 --> 01:41:28,605
No.
You listen, sir.

1455
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:31,628
My husband has already died once
as you've seen on the news.

1456
01:41:31,654 --> 01:41:36,007
Trust me. Having him die a second
time is not going to play well on CNN.

1457
01:41:36,148 --> 01:41:38,554
There we go, buddy.

1458
01:41:39,112 --> 01:41:41,492
That's it, alright.

1459
01:41:42,244 --> 01:41:45,375
Camp 2

1460
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,478
- Beck.
- Uh-huh.

1461
01:41:49,273 --> 01:41:50,404
How're you doing?

1462
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:53,170
Oh, you know,
third amendment.

1463
01:41:53,462 --> 01:41:55,033
Warm enough?

1464
01:41:55,862 --> 01:41:57,838
I'm not sure yet.

1465
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,488
Look like you are,
a little bit.

1466
01:42:02,715 --> 01:42:04,720
How's Rob doing?

1467
01:42:07,432 --> 01:42:10,152
Rob's still up there right now.

1468
01:42:12,329 --> 01:42:14,917
And Doug,
what's he up to?

1469
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:21,497
Doug's gone, Beck.

1470
01:42:37,362 --> 01:42:40,048
I don't know. No one's ever try
to fly higher than Base Camp before.

1471
01:42:40,073 --> 01:42:41,972
They gonna give it a go.

1472
01:42:41,997 --> 01:42:44,487
Just find an LZ. Just make up
with whatever you can.

1473
01:42:44,511 --> 01:42:46,162
Okay.
Worth a try.

1474
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,579
Thanks, Guy.

1475
01:42:47,606 --> 01:42:49,472
Grab a Gatorade.
Got a chopper coming in.

1476
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,088
We need to make a LZ

1477
01:42:51,113 --> 01:42:53,692
We got a chopper coming in!

1478
01:42:54,346 --> 01:42:56,914
- Clear the rope back to the tents!
- Okay.

1479
01:42:56,939 --> 01:42:58,001
Thanks.

1480
01:42:58,025 --> 01:43:00,615
Keep it clear.
Keep this whole area clear.

1481
01:43:01,261 --> 01:43:02,900
Come on.
Come on.

1482
01:43:17,792 --> 01:43:19,865
You can't pause zipping.

1483
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:22,926
You land here,
we'll never get back up.

1484
01:43:29,155 --> 01:43:31,453
Okay, Major, let's go back.

1485
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:52,161
- That's it.
- Can't get any more out.

1486
01:43:52,185 --> 01:43:54,351
it's as light as
we're going to get it.

1487
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:58,220
- Tango to Charlie.
- Tango to Charlie.

1488
01:44:09,149 --> 01:44:11,462
Right here!
Right here!

1489
01:44:13,579 --> 01:44:16,100
Come on!
Come closer!

1490
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:45,712
Come, Beck.

1491
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,279
Right there.

1492
01:44:50,155 --> 01:44:51,917
Okay.
Come on.

1493
01:44:54,519 --> 01:44:55,690
Get closer.

1494
01:44:55,716 --> 01:44:58,462
- Only 1 hand, sir.
- Just hand, just 1.

1495
01:44:58,487 --> 01:45:01,051
- Alright.
- There you go.

1496
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:05,769
You good?

1497
01:45:06,097 --> 01:45:09,270
I'm going to lift the tail up.
Flies over the edge.

1498
01:45:09,442 --> 01:45:11,563


1499
01:44:59,587 --> 01:45:01,858
- Is that okay with you?
- I'm with you.

1500
01:45:13,882 --> 01:45:15,677
Good, man.

1501
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:24,488
It's alright.

1502
01:46:30,011 --> 01:46:32,506
I'm so sorry, Helen.

1503
01:46:32,925 --> 01:46:35,292
Come on.
Let's get you inside.

1504
01:46:56,886 --> 01:46:58,689
Hi, Peachy.

1505
01:47:03,242 --> 01:47:04,671
Beck.

1506
01:47:17,427 --> 01:47:19,828
Thank you so much, darling.

1507
01:47:40,212 --> 01:47:42,560
Oh, Jan.
I'm so sorry.

1508
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:20,229
Rob's body remains on the mountain
with the others who lost their lives.

Beck Weathers lost both his hands and nose.

1515
01:49:03,065 --> 01:49:07,462
He still lives in Dallas with his wife, Peach.

1516

In July 1996, Jan gave birth to a baby.
