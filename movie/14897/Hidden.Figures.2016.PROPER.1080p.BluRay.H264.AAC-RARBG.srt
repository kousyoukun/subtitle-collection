1
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,090
14, 15...

2
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,000
16, prime...

3
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,360
18, prime...

4
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,440
20...

5
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,520
21...

6
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,040
22, prime...

7
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,540
West Virginia
Collegiate Institute

8
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,200
is the best school for
Negros in the state.

9
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,640
It's the only school
past the eighth grade

10
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,730
anywhere near here.

11
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,840
Isosceles.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,920
Scalene.

13
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,680
Equilateral.

14
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,750
Rhombus.

15
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,720
Trapezoid.

16
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,880
Katherine's in the sixth grade.

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,100
They want to take her early.

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,760
Tetrahedron.

19
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,600
Dodecahedron.

20
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,460
They're offering
a full scholarship.

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,960
All you have to do is get there.

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,870
Ms. Coleman...

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,760
why don't you solve
the equation on the board?

24
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,240
We took up a collection

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,720
amongst the teachers and such.

26
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,890
It's not a lot...

27
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,160
but it's enough
to help get you settled in.

28
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,550
That's more than kind,
Ms. Sumner.

29
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,820
If the product of two terms

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,920
is zero then common sense says

31
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,160
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,240
So if you move all the
terms over to one side,

33
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,440
you can put the quadratics
into a form

34
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,750
that can be factored...

35
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,520
allowing that side
of the equation

36
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,610
to equal zero.

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,900
Once you've done that,
it's pretty straightforward

38
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,930
from there.

39
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,970
In all my years of teaching...

40
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,440
I've never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.

41
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,450
Katherine!

42
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,280
Hurry on now, love.

43
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,320
You have to go.

44
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,800
Let Mama tuck you in.

45
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,640
You have to see
what she becomes.

46
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,360
Okay, try to turn it over now.

47
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,990
Katherine?

48
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,840
Mary!

49
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,330
Somebody!

50
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,450
Katherine!

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,000
Quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over.

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,310
I got it.

53
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm not deaf.

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,370
I wonder sometimes.

55
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,930
Here it goes.

56
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,840
Yeah, it's the starter.

57
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,840
That is definitely the starter.

58
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,840
This starter is starting
to make us late.

59
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,450
We are all gonna
end up unemployed...

60
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,910
riding around in this pile
of junk to work every day.

61
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,840
You're welcome
to walk the 16 miles.

62
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,040
Or sit in the back of the bus.

63
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,840
I won't do neither.

64
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,720
I'll hitchhike.

65
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,400
Girls.

66
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,640
No crime in a
broken-down car.

67
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,040
No crime being Negro neither.

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,350
Button it up, Mary.

69
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,430
Nobody wants to go to
jail behind your mouth.

70
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,130
I'll do my best, sugar.

71
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,270
Not a great place for three of
y'all be having car trouble.

72
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,490
We didn't pick the place,
Officer. It picked us.

73
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,160
You being disrespectful?

74
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,720
No, sir.

75
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,470
You have identification on you?

76
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,120
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

77
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,160
We're just on our way to work...

78
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,390
at Langley.

79
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,920
NASA, sir.

80
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,600
We do a great deal
of the calculating.

81
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,440
Getting our rockets into space.

82
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,120
All three of you?
Yes, sir.

83
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,290
Yes, Officer.

84
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,770
NASA.

85
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,120
Now that's something.

86
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,520
I had no idea they hired...

87
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,280
There are quite a few women
working in the space program.

88
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,960
Damn Russians are
watching us right now.

89
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,960
Sputniks.

90
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,120
You girls ever
meet those astronauts?

91
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,680
Mercury Seven?

92
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,280
Absolutely.

93
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,840
Uh, yes, sir. We work with
those gentlemen all the time.

94
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,200
Those boys are the best
we got. I'm sure of that.

95
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,260
We gotta get a man up there
before the commies do.

97
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,290
Yes.
Absolutely.

98
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,820
Whole damn country's
counting on them.

99
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,960
That's for certain.

100
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,680
Hard being of service
broken down

101
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,520
on the side of the road, though.

102
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,400
Right, right.

103
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,240
Well, do y'all need a tow
or something?

104
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,010
No, thank you, Officer.
I think I got it.

105
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,230
Just give me my...

106
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,680
Just need to bypass the starter.

107
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,040
She's good at this stuff.

108
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,800
Whoo! Attagirl.

109
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,930
We're all set.

110
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,470
Well, hell, least I can do
is give y'all an escort.

111
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,200
I imagine you're
running late to work.

112
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,040
No, sir. We wouldn't
wanna bother you.

113
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,490
That would be
wonderful, Officer.

114
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,040
Thank you so much, sir.

115
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,130
Follow me.

116
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,210
I'm driving.

117
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,060
Hurry up, Dorothy,
before he changes his mind.

118
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,240
- We're coming.
- Hold your horses.

119
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,140
Yes!
Whoa, slow down, Mary!

120
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,640
Mary, slow down!
You're too close!

121
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,860
Be quiet.
He said to follow him.

122
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,080
He didn't mean up his behind!

123
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,360
Dear Lord, I don't even
know where to begin!

124
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,880
Oh, I'll tell you
where to begin.

125
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,680
Three Negro women are chasing
a white police officer

126
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,600
down the highway
in Hampton, Virginia...

127
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,600
1961.

128
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,600
Ladies, that there
is a God-ordained miracle.

129
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,720
And, tomorrow,
I'm riding the bus.

130
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm moving over

131
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,550
I'm on a sidewalk

132
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,480
I'm going over

133
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,960
Lift off
is good. Trajectory is stable.

134
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,240
Show me.

135
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,560
No, exactly.

136
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,000
40.349110 degrees North.

137
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,400
Ascent angle 46. 56.

138
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,560
Approaching
7,400 miles per hour.

139
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,600
118 seconds.

140
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,120
Boosters have disengaged.

141
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,640
Second stage success.

142
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,450
Korabl-Sputnik 4 is orbital.

143
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,480
Orbital entry is established.

144
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,240
Russian orbital entry
is established.

145
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,840
Jim Webb.

146
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,600
Yes, Mr. President.

147
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,960
We certainly are, sir.

148
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,960
Uh, it looks like
they've achieved

149
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,400
at least one orbit, maybe two.

150
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,200
Chernushka is ready to go again.

151
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,840
So is our comrade, Ivan,
a brave space traveler.

152
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,640
We have proven life can
be sustained in space.

153
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,880
Now we will be first
to send a human.

154
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,040
A damn dog and a damn mannequin.

155
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,320
And then, a 1.6 megaton RDS-37
thermonuclear warhead...

156
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,200
drops down in the middle
of Des Moines.

157
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,770
Well, that's
a pretty big jump, sir.

158
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,850
What?

159
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,160
Just that...
Who the hell is he?

160
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,360
Paul Stafford,
our lead engineer, Mr. Webb.

161
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,730
I think what he meant to say...

162
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,290
is that speculation, at least
on our side of the equation...

163
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,360
by definition can be...

164
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,160
just a little dangerous.

165
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,360
Dangerous?

166
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,990
You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

167
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,200
Inaction and indecision.

168
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,000
The Russians
have a spy satellite

169
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,090
lapping the planet,

170
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,320
taking pictures
of God knows what!

171
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,830
The President is demanding
an immediate response.

172
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,570
No more delay.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn,

173
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,820
your uncle Bob,
it doesn't matter.

174
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,910
Get us up there, Harrison.

175
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,280
We can't justify a space program

176
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,720
that doesn't put
anything in space.

177
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,520
How'd that feel in there, Paul?

178
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,680
You think you enlightened
the administrator?

179
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,610
Hmm?

180
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,920
No, he didn't look
enlightened to me.

181
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,040
He look enlightened to you, Sam?

182
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,270
Not particularly.

183
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,510
And just so you know,

184
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,180
he's not wrong about
what he said in there.

185
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,600
You know that, right?

186
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,480
Because now that
they can get up there,

187
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,710
a bomb will follow.

188
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,720
It's what happens
to all our good ideas.

189
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,120
I imagine theirs too.
Where's...

190
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,760
Where's the machine?

191
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,930
Any day now,
Mr. Harrison.

192
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,200
Any day now.
Yes, sir.

193
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,710
What's it called?
The initials.

194
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,080
The IBM.

195
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,760
International Business Machines.

196
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,600
Space is a business.

197
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,600
I need a mathematician.

198
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,050
I'll put in
another request, sir.

199
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,330
"Another request."
Jesus Christ.

200
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,600
We don't have a single person
in this entire building

201
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,070
that can handle
analytic geometry?

202
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,290
That's what I've been told.

203
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,540
Tell me something else, Ruth...

204
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,000
like we're gonna find
such a person

205
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,560
before the Russians plant a flag

206
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,650
on the damn moon.

207
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,810
A real good time.

208
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,050
All right, Gloria.

209
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,730
You'll be with engineering,
building four.

210
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,920
Ladies, ladies.

211
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,620
If you're tardy,
you don't get an assignment.

212
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,740
If you don't get an assignment,

213
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,830
you don't have a job.

214
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,190
Eleanor.

215
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,960
Data Reduction, building 202.

216
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,280
Data Reduction?

217
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,000
You're welcome
to join the charmers

218
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,640
in Magnetoplasma Dynamics.

219
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,950
Oh, no, ma'am.

220
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,520
Thank you.
Data Reduction is just fine.

221
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,200
Mm-hmm.

222
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,600
Mary.
Present.

223
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,200
The Mercury Seven prototype
has arrived for testing.

224
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,320
Mr. Zielinski's
requesting you

225
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,320
for permanent assignment.

226
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,800
Are you serious?

227
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,970
Get moving.

228
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,160
Ooh, thank you, Jesus.

229
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,440
Thank you, Jesus!

230
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,040
Oh, thank you. Mary, Mary.
Keep it inside.

231
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,560
Okay. I'm sorry, Dor.

232
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,320
All right, Ms. Late.

233
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,520
You will also be supporting
the east group.

234
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,360
Mrs. Mitchell.

235
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,480
We're on double-time
this morning, girls.

236
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,950
I need these calculations
before lunch.

237
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,400
Space Task Group
needs a computer, ASAP.

238
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,150
Someone with a handle
on analytic geometry.

239
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,160
We can't fill that position
out of the east group.

240
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,470
Permanent or temp?

241
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,000
Everything's temporary, Dorothy.

242
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,200
You have someone?

243
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,560
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,680
Katherine's the gal for that.

245
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,000
She can handle any numbers
you put in front of her.

246
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,480
I'll check her credentials.

247
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,000
Didn't think I'd come
all the way down here.

248
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,880
Here. Finish passing
those out.

249
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,050
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,640
Mrs. Mitchell.

251
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,810
If I could...

252
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,750
My application
for supervisor, ma'am.

253
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,700
Was just wondering if they're
still considering me

254
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,080
for that position.

255
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,310
Yes.

256
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,560
Well, the official word is no.

257
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,810
They're not assigning a permanent
supervisor for the colored group.

258
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,920
May I ask why?

259
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,560
I don't know why.

260
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,240
I didn't ask why.

261
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,960
We need a supervisor, ma'am.

262
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,120
We haven't had one
since Miss Jansen got sick.

263
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,640
It's been almost a year.

264
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,400
Things are working
just fine as is.

265
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,360
I'm doing the work
of a supervisor.

266
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,880
Well, that's NASA for you.

267
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,360
Fast with rocket ships,
slow with advancement.

268
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,200
Get those trajectory
calcs worked out.

269
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,000
We need them
for the Redstone test.

270
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,880
Mach one tunnel test.
T-minus one minute.

271
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,520
No shoe is worth your life.

272
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,830
One moment.

273
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,920
T-minus 10, 9...

274
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,360
8...

275
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,450
7...

276
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,320
6, 5, 4...

277
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,000
Shut it down.

278
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,080
If we alter the exterior
from smooth to corrugated...

279
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,840
the capsule might have
more stability.

280
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,280
But the friction,
it is under during re-entry...

281
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,640
Most shield erosion occurs

282
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,720
on the posterior side
abutting the retro-boosters.

283
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,880
Conclusion?

284
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,400
The area closest to the boosters

285
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,840
is closest to the heat.

286
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,960
Coupled with rising
temperature on re-entry...

287
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,720
the contact softens.

288
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,000
We could consider
another fastener

289
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,400
other than the bolts.

290
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,590
Yes.

291
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes.

292
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,670
There is another opening

293
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,560
in the Engineer
Training Program.

294
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,920
Flat head rivets
would reduce wind drag.

295
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,800
Mary, a person
with engineer's mind

296
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,400
should be an engineer.

297
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,410
You can't be a computer
the rest of your life.

298
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,710
Mr. Zielinski...

299
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,040
I'm a Negro woman.

300
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm not gonna entertain
the impossible.

301
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,680
And I'm a Polish Jew

302
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,760
whose parents died
in a Nazi prison camp.

303
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,960
Now I'm standing
beneath a spaceship

304
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,080
that's going to carry an
astronaut to the stars.

305
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,720
I think we can say we are
living the impossible.

306
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,240
Let me ask you...

307
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,840
if you were a white male,

308
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,440
would you wish
to be an engineer?

309
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,000
I wouldn't have to.
I'd already be one.

310
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,400
Skirts must be worn
past the knee.

311
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,760
Sweaters are preferred
to blouses.

312
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,960
No jewelry.

313
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,160
A simple pearl necklace
is the exception.

314
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,080
Your supervisor
is Mr. Al Harrison,

315
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,400
Director of
the Space Task Group.

316
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,840
You'll write research,
proof calculations, so forth.

317
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,800
Do not talk to Mr. Harrison
unless he talks to you.

318
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,080
Not many computers last
more than a few days.

319
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,280
He's been through a dozen
in as many months.

320
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,280
Come on, keep up.

321
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,280
Things move fast around here.

322
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,920
Your clearance.

323
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,880
They've never had a colored
in here before, Katherine.

324
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,230
Don't embarrass me.

325
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,720
This wasn't emptied last night.

326
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm sorry, I'm not the...

327
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,800
custodian.

328
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,470
Excuse me, ma'am.

329
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,680
Mr. Harrison's computer
reporting.

330
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,520
Take the desk in the back.
I'll get you work in a bit.

331
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,080
Mr. Harrison won't warm up
to you. Don't expect it.

332
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,570
Do your work,
keep your head down.

333
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,330
Thank you.

334
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,560
Go on. Get settled.

335
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,890
Paul.

336
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,280
Why are we still losing shingles

337
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,600
off the heat shield?

338
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,120
We're working with a prototype
of the capsule, Al.

339
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,100
Its lid is one third the
size of what it's going...

340
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,130
I get that.

341
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,720
So, what do we do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

342
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,160
Turn it down?
No, Al. I don't think...

343
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,710
It was a joke.

344
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,960
Paul, if the heat shield
comes off...

345
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,810
what do you think happens
to our astronaut?

346
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,890
I know.

347
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,130
So we're gonna come up
with a solve, right?

348
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,370
Yes, sir.
We're working on it.

349
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,720
Ruth, what's the status
on that computer?

350
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,880
She's right behind you,
Mr. Harrison.

351
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,390
Does she handle
Analytic Geometry?

352
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,440
Absolutely.
And she speaks.

353
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,830
Yes, sir. I do.

354
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,600
Which one?
Both.

355
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,240
Geometry and speaking.

356
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,480
Ruth, get me the...

357
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,610
You think you...

358
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,100
You think you can find me
the Frenet frame

359
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,130
for this data?

360
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,560
Using the Gram-Schmidt...

361
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,720
Orthogonalization algorithm.
Yes, sir.

362
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,520
I prefer it over
Euclidean coordinates.

363
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,080
Okay, good.

364
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,170
Good, then I'm gonna need
it by the end of the day.

365
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes.

366
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,630
I'm also gonna ask you

367
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,810
to check
Mr. Stafford's math

368
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,320
as well as others' on this floor

369
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,470
from time to time.

370
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,650
I can handle that, Al.

371
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

372
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,320
But if that were the case

373
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,020
shingles wouldn't be flying
off the heat shield,

374
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,050
now would they?

375
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,920
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention

376
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,070
for a moment?

377
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,680
Thank you.

378
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,840
Just to be clear...

379
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,880
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven
will be here for training.

380
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,880
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

381
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,880
asking us questions
about our work.

382
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,160
I think that's pretty reasonable

383
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,280
given we're putting a human
on top of a missile,

384
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,490
shooting him into space,

385
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,000
and it's never been done before.

386
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,890
Because it's never been done,

387
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,350
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter.

388
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,600
It's gonna matter
to their wives...

389
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,320
to their children.

390
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,130
I believe it's gonna matter
to the whole damn country.

391
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,150
So this Space Task Group
will be as advertised.

392
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,560
America's greatest engineering
and scientific minds

393
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,280
are not gonna have a problem

394
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,800
with having their work checked.
Are they, Paul?

395
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,240
No, sir.

396
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,320
Good. So let's have
an amen, damn it.

397
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,490
Amen.

398
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,200
Amen!

399
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,990
All right.

400
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,200
My numbers are spot on.

401
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,120
I will double check them, sir.
No problem.

402
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,610
Uh...

403
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm not gonna be able to...
Work on what you can read.

404
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,600
The rest is classified.
You don't have clearance.

405
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,960
These are the numbers
Mr. Harrison gave me.

406
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,080
Yes, I'm absolutely...
Excuse me.

407
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,720
May I ask
where the ladies' room is?

408
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,390
Sorry. I have no idea
where your bathroom is.

409
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,680
Yes, sir.

410
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,240
Uh, yes, sir.

411
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,840
Summertime in
Virginia was an oven

412
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,160
All the kids eating
ice cream with their cousins

413
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,880
I was studyin' while you
was playing the dozens

414
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,560
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

415
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,360
Runnin' from the man

416
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,670
Runnin' from the badge

417
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,200
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

418
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,200
Runnin' toward our plans

419
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,720
And the judges hands

420
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,880
Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't

421
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,560
I know they say
you crawl before you walk

422
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,160
But in my mind I already jog

423
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,680
If I stand still
I cannot get far

424
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,480
They want the moon I'm on Mars

425
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,880
Sometime my mind dives deep
when I'm runnin'

426
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,630
Together we'll fly
But no more runnin'

427
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,090
Ruth!

428
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,250
Yes, Mr. Harrison?

429
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,040
Ruth, where's that girl
with the numbers?

430
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,320
On a... break.

431
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,480
We take breaks now?

432
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,760
Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'

433
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,450
I don't want no free ride

434
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,840
I'm just sick and tired
of runnin'

435
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,120
Together we fly
But no more runnin'

436
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,560
My God, where have you been?

437
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,910
Are you finished yet?

438
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,120
Uh...

439
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,880
Almost. He said
by the end of the day.

440
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,840
The end of the day around
here was yesterday.

441
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,520
I need those done first.

442
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,040
He wants those done first.
Okay.

443
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,210
Get going.

444
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,470
I'm sorry about that.

445
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,880
Somebody's working on it
right now.

446
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,790
Mr. Harrison.

447
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,640
Yeah. Uh, Just set it...
You know.

448
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,880
And Stafford's
heat shield calcs?

449
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,040
It's hard to be sure, sir.

450
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,200
Hard to be sure.

451
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,680
You know what we're doing here?

452
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,240
Trying to put
a man into space, sir.

453
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,600
That's right.

454
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,530
That's right. So you can
throw that in the trash.

455
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,960
Excuse me?

456
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,640
I said you can throw it away.

457
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,170
Here.

458
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,760
It's not an insult to your work.

459
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,480
It's just obsolete.

460
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,880
That's how fast things
are moving around here.

461
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,400
If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

462
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,350
What I'm asking you to do,

463
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,010
what I'm asking everyone
in that room...

464
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,240
all my geniuses...

465
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,080
is to look beyond the numbers.

466
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,920
To look around them.

467
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,720
Through them.

468
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,120
For answers to questions
we don't even know to ask.

469
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,960
Math that doesn't yet exist.

470
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,870
Because without it,
we're not going anywhere.

471
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,800
We're staying on the ground.

472
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,530
We're not flying into space.
We're not circling the Earth.

473
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,400
And we're certainly not
touching the Moon.

474
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,760
And in my mind...

475
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,320
In my mind, I'm already there.

476
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,570
Are you?

477
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,270
Yes, sir.

478
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,430
Good.

479
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,980
Because I don't need
another smart girl

480
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,230
with an adding machine.

481
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,920
Can I go, sir?

482
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, go.

483
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,680
Yes, you can go.

484
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,200
We've been waiting for hours.
Next time, you take the bus.

485
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,590
She's in a mood.

486
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,880
People talkin'
tryin' to break us up

487
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,160
Why won't they let us be?

488
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,800
Brick and stones
may break my bones

489
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,880
But talk don't bother me

490
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,080
I've been abused

491
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,600
In my heart

492
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,600
I haven't been late
one day in 10 years.

493
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,400
Haven't been out sick.
Haven't complained.

494
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,570
My work's on time.

495
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,040
It's done right.
It's done well.

496
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,560
It's not fair, that's a fact.

497
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,240
What's not fair is having

498
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,460
the responsibility
of a supervisor...

499
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,280
- but not the title or the pay.
- Mmm.

500
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,270
Watching you two move on.

501
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,040
Now, don't get me wrong.

502
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,770
Any upward movement
is movement for us all.

503
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,920
Just isn't movement for me.

504
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,090
Truth be told, Dorothy...

505
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,480
I don't even know
if I can keep up in that room.

506
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,920
I'll be back with
the computers in a week.

507
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,840
Or out of a job entirely.

508
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,040
Oh, please.

509
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,860
You're better with the numbers
than anyone in there,

510
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,970
Katherine, and you know it.

511
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,180
Just make that pencil move
as fast as your mind does...

512
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,680
you'll be fine.

513
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,720
And you, have some respect.

514
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,520
Get your damn feet
off my dashboard.

515
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,730
This isn't your living room.

516
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,840
I sound like a supervisor,
don't I?

517
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,560
A mean old salty one.

518
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,560
Riddled with authority,
no question.

519
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,800
You don't mess
with Mrs. Vaughan.

520
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,480
Turn that music up.

521
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,170
Good night, Katherine.

522
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,290
Bye, Kat.

523
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,370
Good night, ladies.

524
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,770
- See you in the morning.
- Bye.

525
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,610
Hey, baby.

526
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,830
Hello, Mama.

527
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,160
I was fixing to call
the National Guard.

528
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,950
Sorry, Mama.
New assignment.

529
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,920
Space Task Group.

530
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,080
Oh, my word.
That sounds important.

531
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,920
It's a promotion?

532
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,920
It might be a slight promotion.

533
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,040
But you want the job, right?

534
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,520
I think so.

535
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,440
It's a challenge, but...

536
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,680
It's nothing you
can't handle, Katherine.

537
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,280
Thank you, Mama.

538
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,950
Are they asleep yet?

539
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,760
They're pretending to be.

540
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,080
- What are you doing?
- I don't...

541
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,920
They're not pretending
well enough.

542
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,010
Constance!

543
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,960
Thank you, Mama.
Love you.

544
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,480
This is my bed.
No.

545
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,570
Get off!

546
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,040
Go back to yours!
I'm oldest! No.

547
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,420
- What are you doing?
- Get off!

548
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,670
What are you doing?

549
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,410
It's not fair how Joylette
gets to sleep by herself

550
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,240
because she's the oldest.

551
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,840
Yes, it is fair.
No, it's not.

552
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,500
- Yes, it is.
- Nuh-uh.

553
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,760
Constance, Kathy, sit.

554
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,080
Now, I understand...

555
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,960
you want to be grown
and have your own space.

556
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,800
So, whoever sleeps in that bed,

557
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,520
in Joylette's place...

558
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,440
will also do the dishes...

559
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,360
take out the trash...

560
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,480
and do all of Joylette's chores.

561
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,470
That's okay. Never mind.

562
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,360
Yeah, she's not so
terrible to share with.

563
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,730
Okay.

564
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,200
Then don't let me come home

565
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,320
and find you like
this again, you hear me?

566
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,950
You're supposed to been
asleep a long time ago.

567
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,640
We just wanted to say goodnight.

568
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,370
You've been gone for 300 hours.

569
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,680
I know. I work a
full-time job now.

570
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,360
You all know that.

571
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,120
I have to be Mommy and Daddy.

572
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,560
I miss your father
just as much as anyone.

573
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,520
He's with the angels.

574
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,640
Yes, he's with all the angels.

575
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,480
And he's watching over us.

576
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,920
Every minute, okay?

577
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,470
That's why we have to be strong.

578
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,570
All right?

579
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,000
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.

580
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,520
Y'all get some rest, okay?

581
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,090
Mama?

582
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,170
Yes, baby?

583
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,070
Are the Russians fixin'
to attack us?

584
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,830
Where'd you get that from?

585
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,530
We had to hide under
our desks today...

586
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,430
all scrunched up.

587
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,080
Okay, baby,
that's called a drill.

588
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,720
It means, uh...

589
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,360
you practice safety

590
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,830
just in case something happens.

591
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,280
Truth is, we don't know
what they're doing up there.

592
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,920
You going to space, too?

593
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,520
No, baby.

594
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,840
But I'm going to do what I can

595
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,040
to help those brave men
get there. Yes, I am.

596
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,040
You could fly up to space
if you wanted to, Mama.

597
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,680
You could be an astronaut.

598
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,760
Did you draw this?
Yes, Mama.

599
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,080
Is that me?

600
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,250
Mmm-hmm.

601
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,110
You see this?

602
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,200
Oh, my goodness.

603
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,960
I love you, baby.

604
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,050
I know.

605
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,600
Come here.

606
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,120
All right. Now this time
really go to bed.

607
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,730
Okay?

608
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,600
I love y'all.
Good night.

609
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,890
Good night.
Good night, Mama.

610
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,880
I love my picture, baby.

611
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,760
Thank you, Lord.

612
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,120
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

613
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,400
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

614
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,570
Hallelujah.

615
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,400
Praise God...

616
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,120
that change is coming.

617
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,440
From the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference...

618
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,600
to the good reverend
Dr. King...

619
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,080
Amen!
Hallelujah!

620
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,440
...to the students sitting in
at lunch counters

621
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,530
in North Carolina.

622
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,690
That's right.
Yes, sir.

623
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,640
His faith in us has no limit.

624
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,640
The good Lord
has our very own women

625
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,440
working on rocket ships.

626
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,640
And we have National Guardsmen

627
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,990
defending our freedom.

628
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,440
Give a shout of praise
for Colonel Jim Johnson.

629
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,120
Returning home,
by the grace of God

630
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,640
to set up a National Guard unit

631
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,280
right here in Hampton.

632
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,720
Can I get a hallelujah in here?

633
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,880
Hallelujah!

634
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,520
I just don't understand.

635
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,680
I don't understand it.

636
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,490
I don't wanna talk
about this again, okay?

637
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,240
A female engineer?

638
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,410
A female engineer?

639
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,080
We're Negro, baby.

640
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,530
Ain't no such thing.
Understand it.

641
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,000
It's not like that there, Levi.

642
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,480
You can't apply for freedom.

643
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,360
Freedom is never granted
to the oppressed.

644
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,040
It's got
to be demanded. Taken.

645
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,040
Stop quoting your slogans at me.

646
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,840
There is more than one way
to achieve something.

647
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,010
I don't want any greens.

648
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,000
Hey. I tell you
about interrupting?

649
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,840
Here. Try this, baby.

650
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,930
Yes.

651
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,800
You're gonna eat
them greens, too.

652
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,840
Kids need
to eat their vegetables.

653
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,720
You'd know that
if you was ever home.

654
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,000
You better settle down,
Levi Jackson.

655
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,840
Unless you want
this female's mind,

656
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,920
right here,
in front of everybody.

657
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,440
All I'm saying...

658
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,360
don't play the fool.

659
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,360
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

660
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,440
NASA's never ever
given you guys your due.

661
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,960
Having a couple of extra degrees

662
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,190
ain't gonna change that.

663
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,880
Civil rights ain't always civil.

664
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,200
I don't want any greens either.

665
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,400
No lip, little miss.

666
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,090
Your brother gets them,
and so do you.

667
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,440
I hear he's planning
on staying in the area.

668
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's good for him.

669
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,430
Katherine, go find
your way over there.

670
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,640
That Colonel Jim
is a tall glass of water.

671
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,080
That he is.

672
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,800
Tall, strong, commanding.

673
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,240
And I bet he's like that
day and night.

674
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,000
Mary, it's Sunday.

675
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,480
Please have some shame.

676
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,920
I will not.

677
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,110
Hmm, I think he's
smiling over here.

678
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,480
At you.

679
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,150
Well I'm not smiling back.

680
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,280
Yes, you are.
Oh, child.

681
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,200
You are all teeth right now.
I am not.

682
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,630
Come over here.

683
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,130
He's coming over.

684
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,620
Now, why would he be doing that?

685
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,330
- 'Cause Mary's waving at him.
- No!

686
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,140
Ladies, I'm not ready.
It's too late. Fix your hair.

687
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,170
Hello, Colonel.

688
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

689
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,740
That's Mary Jackson.
I believe you met her husband, Levi.

690
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,280
Yes, ma'am.
Good to meet y'all.

691
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,800
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

692
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,760
She's not married.
She's a widow...

693
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,120
...with three beautiful
little girls.

694
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,290
So well behaved.

695
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,600
Angels on earth is what
we like to call them.

696
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,440
Dorothy, slice of pie?

697
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,120
I'd love one.

698
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,760
Excuse me.

699
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,100
You already have
a slice of pie...

700
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,130
Uh-huh.

701
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,440
I was just, uh, fixing my
three babies some plates...

702
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,840
Let me help you.

703
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,030
Sure.

704
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,200
Fruit salad.
Mmm-hmm.

705
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,560
Pastor mentioned you're
a computer at NASA.

706
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,650
Yes.

707
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,040
What's that entail?

708
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,650
Oh.

709
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,960
We calculate
the mathematics necessary

710
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,690
to enable launch and landing
for the space program.

711
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,350
That's pretty heady stuff.

712
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,560
Yes, it is.

713
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,440
They let women
handle that sort of...

714
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,530
Uh...

715
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,030
That's not what I mean.

716
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,520
What do you mean?

717
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,640
I'm just surprised
that something so...

718
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,760
taxing...
Mmm-hmm.

719
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,360
Mr. Johnson.

720
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,680
If I were you,
I'd quit talking right now.

721
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,070
I didn't mean no disrespect.

722
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,600
I will have you know

723
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,840
I was the first
Negro female student

724
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,200
at West Virginia University
Graduate School.

725
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,150
On any given day...

726
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,440
I analyze the manometer levels

727
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,990
for air displacement,
friction, and velocity

728
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,640
and compute
over 10,000 calculations

729
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,440
by cosine, square root...

730
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,640
and, lately, analytic geometry.

731
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,730
By hand.

732
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,810
There are 20 bright,
highly capable

733
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,720
Negro women
in the West Computing Group.

734
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,360
And we're proud to be doing
our part for the country.

735
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,210
So, yes.

736
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,750
They let women do some things
at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

737
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,720
And it's not because
we wear skirts.

738
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,280
It's because we wear glasses.

739
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,920
Have a good day.

740
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,240
Scott, welcome to Langley.

741
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,720
Welcome to Langley.
Welcome.

742
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,240
Good to have
you here, gentlemen.

743
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,600
Thank you.

744
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,440
That's Alan Shepard,
U.S. Navy pilot.

745
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,440
He could be the
first man in space.

746
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,280
And that's Scott Carpenter
and Walter Schirra...

747
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,000
also Navy pilots.

748
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,920
All under 5'11", 180 pounds.

749
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,680
IQs over 130.
Mmm.

750
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,760
And handsome must be
a requirement too.

751
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,640
How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

752
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,810
It's equal rights.

753
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,920
I have the right to see
fine in every color.

754
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,240
And that's John Glenn.
He's the only Marine Corps pilot.

755
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,920
Gentlemen, if we may,
much to see around here.

756
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,010
Well, heck, we haven't
shaken all the hands yet.

757
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,690
We have a fairly tight
itinerary, Colonel.

758
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,770
Ruth, he's fine.

759
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,260
He's coming this way.
Look straight ahead.

760
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,290
I'm looking right at him.

761
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,440
Ladies, I didn't wanna run
off without saying hello.

762
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,120
Seem to be in a big
rush around here.

763
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,200
The Russians certainly
aren't slowing down any.

764
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,960
They can't build
a damn refrigerator.

765
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,650
How the heck did they
beat us into space?

766
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,260
And what do you ladies do
for NASA?

767
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,850
Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

768
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,020
You can't get anywhere
without the numbers.

769
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,050
No, sir.

770
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,000
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.
Engineering.

771
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,620
And I'm proud as the devil
to be working with you.

772
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,790
Thank you, Mary.

773
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,890
John.

774
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,800
John, let's take it inside.
Yes, sir.

775
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,600
Guys.
Nice meeting you guys.

776
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,250
Thank you, Colonel.
Good luck, sir.

777
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,640
God bless you all.

778
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,840
Thank you. That's wonderful.

779
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,650
Thank you!

780
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,560
Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm

781
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,360
launch and landing for the
Redstone rocket test.

782
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,600
I cannot work on what
I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.

783
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,830
It's illegible.

784
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,650
Those numbers have
already been confirmed

785
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,600
by two engineers in this
department and myself.

786
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,800
This is more or less
a dummy check.

787
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,410
You have one, we make it two.
Make it double, okay?

788
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,240
We gotta get it.
Just make it happen.

789
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,280
No one thought to measure
these things?

790
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm afraid not, sir.

791
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,600
Well, would you like us to stop?

792
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,760
No. No, just...

793
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,840
Actually, no.
Just keep going.

794
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,480
In fact, use the big hammer.

795
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,650
Yes, sir.

796
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,900
Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go.

797
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:13,930
Watch out.

798
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:40,970
Ma'am.

799
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,560
Our runner can pick up
your work, Dorothy.

800
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,200
You need to be working,
not walking.

801
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,640
Oh, it's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

802
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,480
Since you made the trip...

803
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,760
you can take that batch
over there.

804
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,320
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

805
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,520
You need something else?
Yes, ma'am.

806
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,020
I was wondering if you know
what they're building

807
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,050
over in the tech wing.

808
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,000
It's called an IBM.

809
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,640
A mainframe machine.

810
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,880
Apparently, it can
do our calculations

811
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,050
in a fraction of the time.

812
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,730
Hmm.

813
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,000
I guess that's good for NASA.

814
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,520
Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

815
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,270
Excuse me.

816
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,490
Hi.

817
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,800
What are you looking at, Paul?

818
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,560
Is that correct?

819
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,010
Yeah.

820
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:41,840
Whose work is that?

821
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,920
I said, whose work is that?

822
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,520
Katherine Goble, sir.

823
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,410
Hello.
Hi.

824
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,500
How did you know the Redstone

825
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,080
couldn't support orbital flight?

826
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,420
That's classified information.

827
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,450
It's top secret.

828
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,280
It's no secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing.

829
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,920
It's fine
for sub-orbital flight

830
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,120
but it can't handle
the weight of the capsule

831
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,290
and push it into space.

832
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,440
Numbers don't lie.

833
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,360
And you figured
all that out with this?

834
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,960
Half the data is redacted.

835
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,200
But what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

836
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:23,050
The distance from launch
to orbit, we know.

837
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,400
Redstone mass, we know.

838
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,440
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

839
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:29,440
And the speeds are there
in the data.

840
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,280
You did the math.

841
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:32,690
Yes, sir.

842
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,320
I looked beyond.

843
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,790
How do you know
about the Atlas rocket?

844
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,800
That's not math.

845
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,030
That data is not here.

846
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,840
Like you said, it's classified.

847
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,800
I held it up to the light.

848
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,320
You held it up to the light?

849
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,550
Yes, sir.

850
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,850
Well, there it is.

851
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,010
Mmm-hmm.

852
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,330
Atlas.

853
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,310
What's your name?

854
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,000
Katherine Goble.

855
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,680
Are you a spy, Katherine?

856
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,850
Am I what?

857
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,090
I said, are you a Russian spy?

858
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,520
No, sir.

859
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,040
I'm not Russian.

860
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,200
She's not Russian, sir.

861
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,840
All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

862
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,060
Give her everything she needs

863
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,340
to work on Shepard's
trajectories.

864
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,440
Without redaction.
Are we clear on that?

865
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,880
Are we sure about this?

866
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,090
What's the issue, Paul?

867
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,680
You heard her.

868
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:36,850
She's not a spy.

869
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,280
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

870
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,120
You know what I think's
a good idea? Darker ink.

871
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,570
I think darker ink's
a good idea.

872
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:45,780
Ruth, could you pass it along?

873
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,810
Yes, sir.

874
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,030
Thank you, Katherine.

875
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,350
Thank you, sir.

876
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,880
This interrogation's over.

877
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,600
You can probably get to the
moon and back with this.

878
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,160
Just not the bathroom.

879
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,480
At least they're not
blind of what you do.

880
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,730
It's not gonna matter soon.

881
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,520
This IBM's gonna
put us all out of work.

882
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,600
How you doing?
What can we do about it?

883
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,320
Only one thing to do.

884
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,200
Learn all we can,
make ourselves valuable.

885
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,260
Somewhere down the line,
a human being

886
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,580
is gonna have
to push the buttons.

887
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,000
That's right.

888
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,760
Oh, mercy.

889
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,520
Well, she must be lost.

890
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,900
NASA doesn't commission females

891
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,250
for the Engineer
Training Program.

892
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:51,150
That position is available
to any qualified applicant.

893
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,120
Right. Except, you don't have
the educational requirements.

894
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,350
I have a bachelor's degree

895
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,780
in mathematics
and physical science.

896
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,680
It's the same as most
engineers around here.

897
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,360
We now require advanced
extension courses

898
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,960
through the University
of Virginia.

899
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,320
It's in the employee
handbook. In addendum.

900
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:07,730
In case you haven't read it.

901
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,520
Every time we have a chance
to get ahead...

902
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,870
they move the finish line.

903
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,450
I just follow the rules
around here.

904
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,160
And I expect everyone
who works for me

905
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,290
to follow them as well.

906
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,640
There are no special
circumstances for anyone.

907
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,280
Y'all should be thankful
you have jobs at all.

908
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,600
"For those that cannot attend classes
at the University of Virginia...

909
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,150
"advanced extension courses
are available

910
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,120
"at the Hampton High School."

911
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,120
That's still a
segregated school, Mary.

912
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,750
Virginia acts like Brown
versus Board of Education

913
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,850
never happened.

914
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,320
They are never gonna
allow a colored woman

915
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,480
to just take classes
at an all-white school.

916
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,440
Well, sounds about right.

917
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,320
That's all you gonna say?

918
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,140
I'm not gonna sit here all day
and listen to you complain

919
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,360
about the way things are.

920
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,610
We're trying to play cards.

921
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,340
Petition the court.
Fight for what you want.

922
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,840
But quit talking about it.

923
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,480
I've been complaining?
For days.

924
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,650
Ladies.

925
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,960
Not one more peep about work.

926
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,190
Deal me in.

927
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,330
Katherine?

928
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:11,760
- Come on.
- Oh, no.

929
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,950
Right here.
You.

930
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,000
Child, I needed this.

931
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,210
Thank you.

932
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,880
Don't give her
anymore, Katherine.

933
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,200
I can't. She drank it all.

934
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,640
Listen, I'm fine.

935
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,680
I'm as fine as I have ever been.

936
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,640
You're drunk
as you've ever been.

937
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,560
Come on. Let's dance, ladies.

938
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,480
Come on, Kat. Let's dance.

939
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,970
Go and dance with her,
Katherine.

940
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,440
Come on.
Get out here.

941
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,640
Hide that.

942
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:40,820
We gonna teach you how to dance.

943
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:41,850
You go ahead.

944
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:43,880
All right.
It's too low.

945
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,680
We gonna teach you
how to get a man.

946
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,680
- Teach me? What?
- That's right. Come on!

947
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,400
You got to know how to dance.

948
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,040
Slow. Slow.
Come on.

949
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,160
Twirl it around.
Twirl, twirl.

950
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,480
Yes!
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

951
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,240
Whoo! Look at her,
Dorothy.

952
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,400
Can I win me one of those
fancy dance contests?

953
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,840
Whip it around.

954
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,420
Yeah, and on the outside.

955
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,720
Was it better than Mama's?

956
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,200
No, not really.

957
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,890
Segregation must go!

958
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:12,760
Segregation must go!

959
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,960
Segregation must go!

960
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,920
Segregation must go!

961
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,420
Don't pay attention to all that.

962
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,930
We're not part
of that trouble. Go on.

963
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,920
"Mind. They must have done..."

964
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,590
We don't want any trouble
in here.

965
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,400
Oh, I'm not here
for any trouble, ma'am.

966
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:48,630
What are you here for?

967
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,450
A book.

968
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,960
You have books
in the colored section.

969
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,960
It doesn't have
what I'm looking for.

970
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,280
That's just the way it is.

971
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,780
Go on, now.
You know better than this.

972
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,110
Get your hands off my boys!
Don't touch them.

973
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,080
You have a blessed day.

974
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:20,960
Separate and equal
are two different things.

975
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,680
Just 'cause it's the way,
doesn't make it right.

976
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,960
Understand?

977
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,010
Yes, Mama.

978
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,320
You act right, you are right.

979
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,120
That's for certain.

980
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,290
Understand?

981
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,480
Yes, Mama.

982
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,360
You took that book, Mama?

983
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,480
Son, I pay taxes.

984
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,680
And taxes pay for everything
in that library.

985
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,840
Can't take something
you already paid for.

986
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,000
"Fortran is a new
and exciting language...

987
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,520
"used by programmers
to communicate with computers.

988
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,000
"It is exciting, as it is
the wave of the future."

989
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,480
All right, everybody smile.

990
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,130
- Everybody smile.
- Aw!

991
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,530
Make a wish.
Make a wish.

992
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,160
Blow. Try again.

993
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,840
There you go.

994
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,000
Leonard, you need
to get you a job now.

995
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,130
Two jobs.

996
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,900
Your baby is nine.
What are you gonna do?

997
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:23,540
Thank you, man.
Yeah, you're just in time.

998
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,880
Look at that.

999
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,040
Look at what?
What a surprise.

1000
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,720
Can't complain, man.

1001
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,520
I'll say.

1002
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,720
Howard must have invited him.
Mmm-hmm.

1003
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,600
Let me go help them
with those flowers.

1004
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,200
Walter, you behave yourself.

1005
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,830
Now, you know,
I'm just... Yeah.

1006
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,440
That's right, baby.
Shake it.

1007
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,240
Yeah. There you go.

1008
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,240
Good to see you.
Yes. Thank you.

1009
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,920
I believe I owe you an apology.

1010
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,550
Well, was that it?

1011
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,040
Can I make it while we dance?

1012
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,650
I'm afraid I simply misspoke
the other day, Mrs. Goble.

1013
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:40,160
I've been away for a long time.

1014
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,920
I imagine I'm just
out of practice.

1015
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:45,800
Mmm-hmm.

1016
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,840
I was hoping you'd allow
me to start over.

1017
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,290
Mmm-hmm.

1018
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:53,640
See, the thing is...

1019
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,730
I have an interest in
getting to know you better.

1020
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:57,330
Mmm-hmm.

1021
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,970
You're one tough customer, huh?

1022
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,200
You haven't said
you're sorry yet.

1023
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,590
Right.

1024
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,800
Of course.

1025
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,800
I'm sorry, Katherine.

1026
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,150
For what, Jim?

1027
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,760
Underestimating you.

1028
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,440
And any other woman like you...

1029
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,800
Though I don't imagine
there's many.

1030
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,000
That's good practice,
right there.

1031
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,780
We interrupt
this musical programming

1032
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,520
with breaking news.

1033
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,840
The Soviet news agency
has announced

1034
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,040
that Russian cosmonaut,
Yuri Gagarin,

1035
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,360
has become
the first man in space.

1036
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,530
Gagarin completed

1037
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:44,890
one full orbit around the planet

1038
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:47,200
in 108 minutes.

1039
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,050
Stay tuned to this station
for more details

1040
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:50,520
as they become available.

1041
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,040
Guess that puts us
behind the curve.

1042
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,530
The Vostok-1 rocket...

1043
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,840
delivered Russian cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin's 3KA capsule...

1044
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,880
into orbit, at 6:07 UTC...

1045
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:05,390
Reentering Russian airspace
at 7: 55 UTC.

1046
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,120
Proving conclusively that man

1047
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,840
could survive
orbital space flight.

1048
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,560
Gagarin was awarded

1049
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:12,060
the Order of Lenin
and a Gold Star...

1050
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,880
Well, they beat
the pants off us.

1051
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,160
Let's go.

1052
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,380
He is also conferred
the title...

1053
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,650
Let's learn how to fly to space.

1054
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,920
"First Soviet Astronaut"...

1055
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,880
and has been proclaimed
a national hero.

1056
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,000
This is a day
of unprecedented triumph...

1057
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,920
for the Russian space program

1058
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,320
and a crushing blow for America

1059
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,400
in the race for space.

1060
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,400
I wanna thank everyone
for staying.

1061
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,720
I know it's late.
And after what I just saw,

1062
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,520
I'm sure everyone's probably
anxious to just go home.

1063
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:43,270
Before we do, I just
have to ask a question.

1064
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,760
The same one

1065
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,700
I've been asking myself
all the way over here...

1066
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,760
which is...

1067
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,120
How the hell did we find ourself

1068
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,120
in second place
in a two-man race?

1069
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:56,930
Anybody?

1070
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:58,930
Paul?

1071
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,930
And I think Glenn said it
pretty well.

1072
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,170
They're just outworking us.

1073
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,480
The reason I have to think that

1074
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,740
is because I refuse to believe

1075
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,320
that the Russians
are smarter than us

1076
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,000
or that they have
more technology,

1077
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,600
or that they care more.

1078
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,160
But I don't know.
Is that possible?

1079
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,680
Is it possible that it actually

1080
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,280
means more to them?

1081
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,960
We're in the fight
of our lives, people.

1082
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,430
We're not on some epic joy ride.

1083
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,280
I just saw seven faces

1084
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,440
who aren't sure
that we can get there.

1085
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,760
This is our problem.

1086
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,120
And so as of right now

1087
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:43,100
there's only two things you
need to know going forward.

1088
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,640
One is staying here,
working late,

1089
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:45,970
that's gonna be a fact of life.

1090
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,640
And two, don't expect
your paychecks

1091
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:50,300
to reflect the extra time
it's gonna take

1092
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,280
to catch up
and pass those bastards.

1093
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,780
For those of you
who can't work that way,

1094
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,160
I understand and thank you
for what you've done.

1095
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,800
For everyone else...

1096
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:04,040
I suggest you call your wives

1097
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,600
and tell them how it's gonna be.

1098
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,520
I'll start with mine.

1099
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,080
Sam, turn it up.
Turn it up.

1100
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,250
Yes, sir.

1101
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,080
John.
Morning, sir.

1102
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,080
7-5, 7-4, 7-3...

1103
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,720
End of the day.

1104
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,920
Okay, we're looking good.

1105
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,070
Okay.

1106
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,200
Sir, might be
the selector latch.

1107
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,550
I'm taking a walk.

1108
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,330
We're honored
to serve our country.

1109
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,720
So we don't think about danger.

1110
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,880
We don't have time to be scared.

1111
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:03,920
We got a job to do.

1112
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,120
Good morning.
Good morning.

1113
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,400
Mrs. Jackson.

1114
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,760
Colored seats are at the back
of the court room.

1115
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,280
Thank you, ma'am.

1116
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,320
So, which one of you
wants to go first?

1117
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:07,320
The IBM 7090
data processing system.

1118
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,680
It has the capability of solving

1119
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,840
over 24,000 multiplications

1120
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,170
per second.

1121
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,040
Holy Moses,
that's lightning fast.

1122
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,410
They'll never get that to work.

1123
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,800
Oh, it'll run eventually.

1124
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,010
And when it does, we have
to know how to program it.

1125
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,610
Unless you'd rather be
out of a job.

1126
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,160
No, ma'am.

1127
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,320
Mr. Z...

1128
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,840
I got a court date.

1129
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:41,200
"The computer uses it

1130
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,880
"as its high speed storage unit,

1131
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,080
"an information
holding device."

1132
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,210
Hmm.

1133
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,200
You have a brain.

1134
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,880
That I can work with.

1135
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,560
This is in the wrong spot.

1136
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,240
Attagirl.

1137
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:05,530
Ruth.

1138
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,300
Yes, sir. Get me the
Cape on the line.

1139
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,160
Shepard's trajectories
need to be updated.

1140
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,080
Wow.

1141
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:15,990
Where is she?

1142
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,170
You and I are no
different from each other

1143
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,320
Shut our eyes
when we slumber I see numbers

1144
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:30,120
Black and white
we're computers, I am color

1145
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,490
Don't act like
you was there when you wasn't

1146
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,040
I don't want no free ride

1147
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:48,360
Some nights I cry

1148
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,480
'Cause I can see the day comin'

1149
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,640
Together we fly

1150
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,040
Oh, but no more runnin'

1151
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:04,600
No more runnin'

1152
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:15,730
Where the hell have you been?

1153
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,360
Everywhere I look, you're not
where I need you to be.

1154
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:19,670
It's not my imagination.

1155
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,960
Now where the hell
do you go every day?

1156
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,440
To the bathroom, sir.

1157
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,800
To the bathroom?

1158
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,590
To the damn bathroom.

1159
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,150
For 40 minutes a day?

1160
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,720
What do you do in there?

1161
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,370
We're T-minus zero here.
I put a lot of faith in you.

1162
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,950
There's no bathroom for me here.

1163
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,540
What do you mean there is
no bathroom for you here?

1164
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,920
There is no bathroom.

1165
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:52,800
There are no colored
bathrooms in this building

1166
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,920
or any building
outside the West Campus,

1167
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,360
which is half a mile away.

1168
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:57,570
Did you know that?

1169
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:02,680
I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself.

1170
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,920
And I can't use
one of the handy bikes.

1171
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,000
Picture that, Mr. Harrison.

1172
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:08,830
My uniform...

1173
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:11,720
Skirt below my knees, my heels,

1174
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,200
and a simple string of pearls.

1175
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:15,040
Well, I don't own pearls.

1176
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,000
Lord knows you don't pay
coloreds enough

1177
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:18,600
to afford pearls!

1178
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,600
And I work like a dog,
day and night,

1179
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,880
living off of coffee from a pot

1180
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,440
none of you wanna touch!

1181
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,770
So, excuse me

1182
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,520
if I have to go to the restroom

1183
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,360
a few times a day.

1184
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,200
There you have it.

1185
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,960
No more colored restrooms.

1186
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,280
No more white restrooms.

1187
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,040
Just plain old toilets.

1188
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,760
Go wherever
you damn well please.

1189
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,960
Preferably closer to your desk.

1190
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,080
Here at NASA,
we all pee the same color.

1191
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,280
Heard you was fighting the flu.

1192
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,160
Figured you could use some soup.

1193
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,760
Hot meal for the girls.

1194
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,560
Come on in.

1195
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,000
Excuse me.

1196
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,600
Okay, ladies.
Let's say grace.

1197
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:13,160
Bow your heads.

1198
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,610
Dear Lord, thank you
for this meal.

1199
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,800
We ask that you bless this food

1200
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,920
so that it may bless our bodies.

1201
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,040
In Jesus's name we pray.

1202
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,600
Amen.
Amen.

1203
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:35,960
It's a historic day,
here at Cape Canaveral.

1204
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,440
And here's what we can expect.

1205
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:40,480
Alan Shepard and Freedom 7
will be launched into space

1206
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:43,320
at an altitude of about
116 miles an hour.

1207
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,360
Dorothy, come on, you gonna miss it!
Oh, boy! Go.

1208
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,700
- Come on, Dorothy.
- I'm coming.

1209
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:48,520
...then he will land
around 35 miles

1210
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:49,690
off the coast of Florida...

1211
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,000
where he'll be picked up

1212
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:52,540
by the men
of the USS Lake Champlain...

1213
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:53,570
Finally. Come over here.

1214
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:55,600
who set out
for this historic purpose.

1215
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,660
Freedom 7,
we're going to have to bleed off

1216
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,400
some of the pressure
inside the liquid oxygen tank.

1217
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,560
That should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule. Over.

1218
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,280
Any day now, CAPCOM.

1219
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,290
Fix your little problem
and light this candle.

1220
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,000
Roger that, Freedom 7.

1221
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:11,560
Stand by.

1222
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,940
Temperature is returning
to normal.

1223
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,920
Running one more
launch status check.

1224
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:16,150
All systems now go.

1225
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,840
Move to final countdown
sequence.

1226
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,520
Moving to final
countdown sequence.

1227
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,610
Roger that.

1228
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:22,840
We're at T-minus 10...

1229
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,590
nine...

1230
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:25,880
eight...

1231
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,360
seven...

1232
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,720
six...

1233
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,120
five...

1234
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,560
four...

1235
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:32,730
three...

1236
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,040
two...

1237
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:35,480
one...

1238
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,870
zero.

1239
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:40,390
We have ignition.

1240
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:42,360
And we have lift off.

1241
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:44,550
Get up there.

1242
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:46,960
Lift off,
and the clock is started.

1243
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,680
Fuel is go. 2.5G.

1244
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:54,910
Get on up there.

1245
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:56,280
- Come on!
- Lift off at

1246
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,240
34 minutes after the hour.

1247
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:21,040
Pitch 88.
Trajectory is good.

1248
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:25,600
Yaw is okay.

1249
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,560
Switching manual roll.

1250
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,720
Yes!

1251
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:33,680
For the eyes of the world

1252
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,960
now look into space,

1253
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:38,430
to the Moon
and to the planets beyond.

1254
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,530
Yes!
We did it!

1255
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:41,720
And we have vowed...

1256
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:44,240
that we shall not
see it governed...

1257
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,640
by a hostile flag of conquest...

1258
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:50,560
but by a banner
of freedom and peace.

1259
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:53,920
We set sail on this new sea...

1260
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:57,360
because there is new knowledge
to be gained...

1261
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,400
and new rights to be won.

1262
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:02,480
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade

1263
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:04,240
and do the other things...

1264
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,080
not because they are easy...

1265
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,040
but because they are hard.

1266
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,680
Suppose we should all
thank President Kennedy

1267
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,720
for the continued job security.

1268
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,200
Uh, Gus Grissom's up next.

1269
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:20,880
Another suborbital flight
with a Redstone.

1270
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,790
It's our last shot

1271
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,280
before we strap Glenn
to the Atlas

1272
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,880
and pray we can bring him
back down.

1273
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:28,560
Yes, and I imagine he'd like us

1274
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,400
to have the math
worked out beforehand.

1275
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,000
Good work, gentlemen.

1276
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:36,280
Go have dinner with your kids

1277
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:38,000
and let's get back to work.

1278
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:54,160
Look what you've done to me

1279
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:59,080
Make me behave like
I wouldn't ever

1280
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:01,440
I know you're the one for me

1281
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:07,160
Your essence is the ink
in the word "forever"

1282
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:13,110
I think it's high time that
I kissed you, Katherine.

1283
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,480
Oh, and why is that?

1284
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:21,600
Figured you attracted to me,
same as I to you.

1285
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,880
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

1286
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:28,150
Or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago.

1287
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,160
Haven't kissed a man
in a long time.

1288
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,640
Almost forgot how to.

1289
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,590
The FBI
has arrested four white men

1290
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:05,120
accused of throwing a fire bomb

1291
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:06,640
into a Freedom Rider bus

1292
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,840
outside of Anniston, Alabama...

1293
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,530
- Hi, babies.
- The bus filled rapidly

1294
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:11,820
Hi, Mama.
...with black smoke.

1295
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,070
We all hit the floor.

1296
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,480
All of us realized
the bus was on fire...

1297
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,720
and had to go out into the mob.

1298
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,100
The kids don't need
to be watching this.

1299
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:20,440
They need to see this.

1300
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,170
When we got off the bus
in Birmingham...

1301
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:23,680
Everybody needs to see this.

1302
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:25,600
...took me and forced me
out of the door...

1303
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:26,910
and threw me into the crowd.

1304
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,680
And then I was beaten by one
big guy and several others.

1305
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:33,000
We think we're rendering
a great service to our nation.

1306
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,880
For this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone.

1307
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:38,920
It is a struggle
to save the soul of America.

1308
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,200
Mary Jackson.

1309
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,880
Petition to attend courses
at Hampton High School.

1310
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,720
Good morning, Your Honor.

1311
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,920
Hampton High School is
a white school, Mrs. Jackson.

1312
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,320
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm aware of that.

1313
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:01,200
Virginia,
still a segregated state.

1314
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:03,280
Regardless of what
the federal government says,

1315
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,640
regardless of what
the Supreme Court says,

1316
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,600
our law is the law.

1317
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,600
Your Honor, if I may.

1318
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,440
I believe there are
special circumstances

1319
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:13,530
to be considered.

1320
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,320
What would warrant
a colored woman

1321
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:16,410
attending a white school?

1322
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,080
May I approach your bench, sir?

1323
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,210
Your Honor...

1324
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:36,440
you of all people
should understand

1325
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,000
the importance of being first.

1326
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,440
How's that, Mrs. Jackson?

1327
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,240
You were the first
in your family

1328
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:45,200
to serve in the Armed Forces.

1329
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,550
U.S. Navy.

1330
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,030
The first to attend university.

1331
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,720
George Mason.

1332
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,080
And the first state judge
to be recommissioned

1333
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:55,590
by three consecutive governors.

1334
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,440
You've done some research.

1335
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,200
Yes, sir.

1336
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:00,960
What's the point?

1337
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:02,440
The point is, Your Honor...

1338
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,800
no Negro woman
in the state of Virginia...

1339
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,310
has ever attended
an all-white high school.

1340
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,490
It's unheard of.

1341
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,240
Yeah. Unheard of.

1342
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:13,610
And before Alan Shepard
sat on top of a rocket,

1343
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,880
no other American
had ever touched space.

1344
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:18,360
And now, he will forever
be remembered

1345
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,950
as the U.S. Navy man
from New Hampshire,

1346
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,160
the first to touch the stars.

1347
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:26,030
And I, sir...

1348
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:28,720
I plan on being
an engineer at NASA,

1349
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,800
but I can't do that
without taking them classes

1350
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,640
at that all-white high school.

1351
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:36,130
And I can't change
the color of my skin.

1352
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,440
So I have no choice
but to be the first.

1353
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,200
Which I can't do
without you, sir.

1354
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,450
Your Honor...

1355
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:48,000
out of all the cases
you're gonna hear today...

1356
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,680
which one is gonna matter
100 years from now?

1357
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,280
Which one is gonna
make you the first?

1358
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,250
Hmm.

1359
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:07,120
Only the night classes...

1360
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:09,560
Mrs. Jackson.

1361
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:19,120
Yes, yes, yes!

1362
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,350
Yes!

1363
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:24,110
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

1364
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:49,700
How late did he say
he was gonna be?

1365
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,620
Excuse me.
No more than five minutes, sir.

1366
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,120
Gus Grissom's coordinates.

1367
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:56,240
Uh, I'd like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1368
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:59,250
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

1369
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:02,480
An orbital launch with an Atlas
rocket is going to take time.

1370
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:04,440
Is there a problem?

1371
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:06,960
Mr. Harrison...

1372
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,360
I was wondering.

1373
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,320
Uh-huh. I've been
wondering my whole life,

1374
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:13,040
so you just spit it out.

1375
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,120
Well, sir...

1376
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:20,600
I would like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1377
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:21,820
This isn't about
plugging in numbers,

1378
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,050
it's about inventing the math.

1379
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:24,900
And I think you and I
talked about that, right?

1380
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:25,930
It doesn't exist.

1381
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,090
I can do it, sir.

1382
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,680
Do you have any idea
how exacting

1383
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,280
these calculations have to be?

1384
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,870
It's like shooting a sawed-off
shotgun from a thousand feet

1385
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,740
and getting that one BB through a
hole so tiny, you can't even see it.

1386
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:36,780
Okay, let me see
what you've got.

1387
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:37,890
I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1388
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:40,520
How have the
Grissom numbers been?

1389
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,600
They've been spot on.

1390
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,510
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1391
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,740
But you run it all through
Stafford, you understand?

1392
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:50,770
Yes, sir.

1393
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:52,390
Thank you.

1394
01:14:56,610 --> 01:14:58,320
Computers don't author reports.

1395
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,720
CAPCOM, this is Liberty Bell 7.

1396
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:08,810
Loud and clear.

1397
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:12,880
Okay, it's a nice
ride up to now.

1398
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,050
Roger.

1399
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,760
Liberty Bell 7,
this is Hook 1 approaching.

1400
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:17,850
Ready to hook on. Over.

1401
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:20,240
I read you loud
and clear. Over.

1402
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:22,410
The hatch is blown, CAPCOM.

1403
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,640
The Liberty Bell 7
capsule is taking on water.

1404
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:27,720
Gus Grissom
is out of the capsule.

1405
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,400
Rescuers are now going
to pull him

1406
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:31,490
from the ocean waves.

1407
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:35,720
Unfortunately, the Liberty
Bell 7 capsule is lost.

1408
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:36,930
Mama.

1409
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:39,850
I can't, I can't.
Mary.

1410
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,180
Mr. Harrison,

1411
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,530
taxpayer money
sank into the ocean

1412
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:50,840
along with your capsule.

1413
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,010
So what makes you think

1414
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,880
you can bring
John Glenn home safely?

1415
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,050
Let me say first...

1416
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,530
discovery is never
just for the sake

1417
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:57,610
of discovery, gentlemen...

1418
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:59,800
but for the sake
of human survival.

1419
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:02,680
And it will always
come with a risk.

1420
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:06,360
Whoever gets there first
will make the rules.

1421
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:08,520
That's been true
of every civilization.

1422
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:10,680
And so, I think
the bigger question

1423
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:12,280
for this body to consider is...

1424
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:16,040
who do you want calling
the shots in space?

1425
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,680
We have to know
what's out there, Senator.

1426
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:20,920
We have to touch the stars,

1427
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:23,310
if only to ensure
our own survival.

1428
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,320
And only a man can do that.

1429
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,600
We'll get John Glenn home safely

1430
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:30,160
because we have to.

1431
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,360
Because he has to tell us
what he saw.

1432
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,920
The Redstone rocket
went straight up.

1433
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,360
But the capsule
didn't have enough speed

1434
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:42,970
to go into orbit,
so it came back down.

1435
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,160
Essentially a triangle.
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1436
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,920
That math was known.

1437
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:51,590
That took Shepard, took Grissom.

1438
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:53,960
That cannot take Glenn.

1439
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,520
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1440
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:59,120
that can push us into orbit.

1441
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:02,400
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1442
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:05,000
Earth's gravity
keeps pulling at it

1443
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,800
but it's going so fast,
it keeps missing the Earth.

1444
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,720
That's how it stays in orbit.

1445
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:12,160
Now, getting it back down...

1446
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,600
that's the math we don't know.

1447
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,690
Yes, Katherine.

1448
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,520
So the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever

1449
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,600
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1450
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:24,330
That's right.

1451
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:27,440
Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1452
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,200
at precisely the right amount,

1453
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,370
that's the task.

1454
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:34,530
Yes, Katherine.

1455
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:38,120
So it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit...

1456
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:41,720
to a parabolic orbit.

1457
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:42,930
Yes.

1458
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:45,760
That's the "Go/No-go."

1459
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,880
Now at this point,
it's a pin head.

1460
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,040
We bring him in too soon...

1461
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,840
He burns up on reentry.

1462
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:53,230
That's right.

1463
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,720
We bring him in too late...

1464
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:56,480
he's pushed
out of Earth's gravity.

1465
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:59,960
And any changes to mass,
weight, speed, time...

1466
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:03,480
distance, friction,
or a puff of wind...

1467
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,440
would alter the "Go/No-go."

1468
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:09,560
And we start
our calculations over.

1469
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:10,970
Yes.

1470
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:16,480
So we need to be able to
choose this reentry point.

1471
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,640
Now this "Go/No-go,"
this has to be exact.

1472
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:20,840
Sam.

1473
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,600
These are the latest
Redstone numbers

1474
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:25,000
in current capsule data.

1475
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,720
Obviously, we know
the launch spot.

1476
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:27,810
Thanks.

1477
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:29,640
A Pentagon briefing
should illuminate

1478
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:31,440
where the Navy
needs the recovery zone.

1479
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:33,480
Then we work backwards
from there.

1480
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:37,760
And the rest is on us,
so let's get to work.

1481
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:39,490
Uh, Mr. Stafford.

1482
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:40,810
What, Katherine?

1483
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,200
If I could attend the briefings,

1484
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:44,440
I'd be more useful
to the project.

1485
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:46,440
Pentagon briefings
are closed door.

1486
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:49,440
Yes, but if we don't
have the information

1487
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:50,840
of the changes...

1488
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:52,010
we can't keep up.

1489
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:53,500
I need those changes
as they occur.

1490
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:54,650
As you said, it's a pin head.

1491
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:56,560
Katherine, that's the job.

1492
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,280
You asked for this assignment,

1493
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:00,440
so just calculate
with what you have.

1494
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,560
Or we'll find someone who can.

1495
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,320
Okay.

1496
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,960
Attagirl.

1497
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,640
What the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here.

1498
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:28,840
Who are you?

1499
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:30,920
I'm with
the West Computing Group.

1500
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,390
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1501
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,280
This is a very delicate
piece of equipment.

1502
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:37,220
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

1503
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,480
Uh-huh.
Bill, we've got numbers.

1504
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:43,560
What kind of numbers?

1505
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,040
Well, I'll be.

1506
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:51,190
What's your name again?

1507
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:53,320
Dorothy Vaughan.

1508
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:55,960
Dorothy Vaughan.

1509
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:05,680
Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.

1510
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,440
Oh, this is all moot.

1511
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:09,440
We're altering the
window on the capsule.

1512
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:11,090
When did this happen?
Six minutes ago.

1513
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,680
The math is changing.
Start over.

1514
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:16,120
Sir, if I could attend the briefings,
I could stay current...

1515
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:17,760
Katherine, we have
been through this.

1516
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:18,930
It is not possible.

1517
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:20,660
There is no protocol
for women attending.

1518
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:21,830
There's no protocol for a man

1519
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,210
circling the Earth either, sir.

1520
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,880
Okay. That is just
the way things are.

1521
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,640
Colonel Glenn's
launch coordinates,

1522
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,210
accounting for
the window change, sir.

1523
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,550
I have told you this.

1524
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,170
Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

1525
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:08,400
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1526
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:10,480
That is not the way this works.

1527
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:13,000
Paul. What's
happening here?

1528
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:15,320
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

1529
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:16,550
And why is that?

1530
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:19,400
Sir, the data changes so fast.
The capsule changes.

1531
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:21,000
The weight and the landing zones

1532
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,600
are all changing, every day.

1533
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:25,000
I do my work, you attend
these briefings,

1534
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:26,090
I have to start over.

1535
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:28,560
Colonel Glenn launches
in a few weeks.

1536
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,650
We don't have the math
figured out yet.

1537
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:33,120
Why is it she can't attend?

1538
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:34,500
Because she doesn't
have clearance, Al.

1539
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:35,960
I cannot do my work effectively

1540
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,410
if I do not have all of the data

1541
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:39,680
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1542
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:41,500
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1543
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:43,200
Pentagon briefings
are not for civilians.

1544
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,460
It requires
the highest clearance.

1545
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:45,500
I feel like I'm the best person

1546
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:46,690
to present my calculations...

1547
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,780
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
No, I am not.

1548
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,760
And she is a woman.
There is no protocol

1549
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:51,980
for a woman
attending these meetings.

1550
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,320
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1551
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,880
But within these walls,

1552
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,360
who makes the rules?

1553
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,040
You, sir. You are the boss.

1554
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:04,840
You just have
to act like one. Sir.

1555
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,350
You keep quiet.

1556
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,310
Thank you.

1557
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,310
Good morning.

1558
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,470
Gentlemen.

1559
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:31,490
This is Katherine Goble

1560
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:33,920
with our Trajectory
and Launch Window division.

1561
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,240
Her work is pertinent
to today's proceedings.

1562
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:39,490
Come on.

1563
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,920
Wanna get her a chair?

1564
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:44,900
We have a
confirmed launch window...

1565
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,250
Get her a chair, please.
Yes, sir.

1566
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:47,380
We have a
confirmed launch window

1567
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:48,520
for Friendship 7.

1568
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:49,850
Let's discuss a landing zone.

1569
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:52,710
The Navy needs
a singular landing zone.

1570
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:55,160
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval.

1571
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:56,370
Outside of that

1572
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:58,240
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1573
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,680
We'd like three possible
recovery areas.

1574
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,210
We can't cover
half the damn ocean.

1575
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,000
With all due respect,

1576
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,840
our capsule's being
altered daily.

1577
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:09,040
We're orbiting the Earth
at what speed now?

1578
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:11,050
Uh...

1579
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:17,800
17,544 miles per hour...

1580
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:19,800
at the time the rocket
delivers the capsule

1581
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:21,120
into low space orbit.

1582
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:26,410
Well, that's one hell
of a speeding ticket.

1583
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:29,930
Okay.

1584
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,400
So we have the vehicle's speed,

1585
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:32,600
the launch window...

1586
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:34,400
and for argument's sake,
the landing zone

1587
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:35,760
is the Bahamas.

1588
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,640
Should be enough
to figure the "Go/No-go"?

1589
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,280
Yeah, in theory, sir.

1590
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:41,040
We need to be past
theory at this point.

1591
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,880
We'll be able to
calculate a "Go/No-go"

1592
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:44,480
with that information.

1593
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,560
When exactly
is that gonna happen?

1594
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:58,010
Katherine.

1595
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,520
Have a go at it.

1596
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:32,670
The "Go" point for re-entry
is 2,990 miles

1597
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:36,680
from where we want
Colonel Glenn to land.

1598
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:39,120
If we assume
that's the Bahamas...

1599
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:44,760
at 17,544 miles per hour...

1600
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,510
upon re-entry...

1601
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,040
370 feet...

1602
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:51,360
at a descent angle...

1603
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:54,880
of 46.56 degrees.

1604
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:56,530
Distance...

1605
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:00,680
velocity squared, sine...

1606
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,040
gravity squared.

1607
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:07,600
Sine, 32 feet.

1608
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:11,320
And the distance would be...

1609
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:17,240
20,530,372 feet...

1610
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:23,080
or 2,990 miles...

1611
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:28,920
or 46.33 degrees.

1612
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,670
Okay, so that puts
your landing zone

1613
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:37,390
at 5.0667 degrees North...

1614
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:40,560
77.3333 degrees West.

1615
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:43,560
Which is here.

1616
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:48,120
Right here.

1617
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,400
Give or take 20 square miles.

1618
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,560
I like her numbers.

1619
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,240
Thank you.

1620
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,880
That, of course, is assuming

1621
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:04,600
the capsule hits
the re-entry point exactly.

1622
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:07,240
How do we ensure that?

1623
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:09,960
That's the math we don't
have yet, gentlemen.

1624
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:11,880
We're working on it.

1625
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:15,270
Katherine.

1626
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,420
What's it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?

1627
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:23,800
We're just getting up
to speed here, Mr. Harrison.

1628
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:24,960
I need more manpower.

1629
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:26,920
I need programmers,
folks to feed the cards.

1630
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:28,560
Get them, for crying out loud.

1631
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:29,650
Okay.

1632
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:31,760
You're the IBM man, right?
Yes, sir.

1633
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:33,760
Go pull them out of the sky
if you have to.

1634
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:35,620
Let's get ahead of this thing
or I'm not paying you.

1635
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:36,870
Understood.

1636
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,240
I got that one, I got that one.

1637
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:45,400
I'm not paying any of you.

1638
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,010
Me?

1639
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:57,800
Temporarily, yes.

1640
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:00,080
We need the IBM
for Glenn's launch.

1641
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,210
The lead engineer says
you're good with the cards,

1642
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,560
programming and such.

1643
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,800
What about the girls here?

1644
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,430
Human computers can't
calculate an orbital flight

1645
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:09,920
in the time we have.

1646
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:11,520
They'll stay put for now.

1647
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:13,360
What about after now?

1648
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:16,590
After Glenn's launch,

1649
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,990
NASA's dissolving
the computing groups.

1650
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,280
I'm not accepting reassignment

1651
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:25,360
unless I bring my
ladies with me.

1652
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:27,280
Excuse me?

1653
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,960
We're gonna need a lot of
manpower to program that beast.

1654
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:31,350
I can't do it alone.

1655
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:34,680
My gals are ready.
They can do the work.

1656
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,350
Ladies.

1657
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:43,400
We've been reassigned.

1658
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:45,950
Leave your calculators.

1659
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:47,560
You won't need them
where we're going.

1660
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:49,800
Welcome, ladies.

1661
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:02,120
You know what your job is, Paul?

1662
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:05,640
Find the genius
among those geniuses.

1663
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,480
To pull us all up.

1664
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,440
We all get to the peak together

1665
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:13,040
or we don't get there at all.

1666
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:18,480
Yes.
Well, good night, sir.

1667
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:50,080
I don't know what time
I'm coming home.

1668
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,920
Class ends at nine.

1669
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:56,520
You got something to say?

1670
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:59,480
I thought you might need these.

1671
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:05,120
You can refill them with
any weight lead you want.

1672
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,360
You see, you just
hit the top like this.

1673
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:12,200
All right?
The lead comes out.

1674
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:14,680
You put the new lead in...

1675
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:17,720
and new pencil.

1676
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:23,640
You gonna make a fine engineer.

1677
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:25,650
You think so?

1678
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:26,870
Yes.

1679
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:30,800
And nobody dare stand
in the way...

1680
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:33,400
of Mary Jackson's dreams.

1681
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:34,960
Myself included.

1682
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,640
Don't make me mad again.

1683
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,030
Yes, ma'am.

1684
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:49,640
And don't make me late, either.

1685
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:51,330
You gonna be late.
I'mma make you late.

1686
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:52,920
You won't be late.

1687
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:00,550
All right, gentlemen.

1688
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:01,770
Tonight, we discuss

1689
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:05,000
Planck-Einstein
wavelength relationships.

1690
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:10,200
Yes?

1691
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:12,830
I'm Mary Jackson.

1692
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,360
I'm enrolled.

1693
01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:18,680
Well, the curriculum
is not designed

1694
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:19,910
for teaching a woman.

1695
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,600
I imagine it's the same
as teaching a man.

1696
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,360
I don't see a colored section.

1697
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:28,280
Should I just take any seat?

1698
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:34,880
Thank you.

1699
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,520
Okay. Uh...

1700
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:43,360
Planck-Einstein.

1701
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,250
The problem...

1702
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:49,480
is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit

1703
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,120
to a parabolic orbit.

1704
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:54,270
There's no mathematical
formula for that.

1705
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,920
Because we can calculate
launch and landing...

1706
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:58,440
but without this conversion

1707
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:00,960
the capsule stays in orbit,
we can't bring it back home.

1708
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,170
Maybe we've been thinking
about this all wrong.

1709
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:06,610
How's that?

1710
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:12,760
Maybe it's not new math at all.

1711
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:16,480
It could be old math.

1712
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,760
Something that looks
at the problem numerically,

1713
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:21,400
and not theoretically.

1714
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:23,320
Math is always dependable.

1715
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:25,680
For you it is.

1716
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:34,520
Euler's method.

1717
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:35,830
Yes.

1718
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,080
But that's ancient.
But it works.

1719
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:40,360
It works numerically.

1720
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:17,710
That's it.

1721
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,390
Let's type it up.

1722
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,570
Okay.

1723
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:26,470
Huh.

1724
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:48,880
Dorothy.

1725
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:51,080
Mrs. Mitchell.

1726
01:33:57,410 --> 01:33:59,240
You're working late today.

1727
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:02,560
Seems to always happen that way.

1728
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:04,720
Yes. Seems to.

1729
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:13,570
Thank you.

1730
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:20,440
I hear the IBM's
up to full capacity.

1731
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:23,240
You certainly
have a knack for it.

1732
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:26,720
My father taught me a thing
or two about mechanics.

1733
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:29,800
You know, I have a few
girls in the East Group

1734
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:32,270
that have an interest
in learning more about it.

1735
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,560
It is the future.

1736
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:36,030
I may bring them by,
if it's all the same to you.

1737
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:38,600
That's not my decision, ma'am.

1738
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,800
That would be the supervisor's.

1739
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:43,480
Yes, that's true.

1740
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:47,320
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

1741
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:50,760
You know, Dorothy.

1742
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:54,400
Despite what you may think...

1743
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:57,800
I have nothing against y'all.

1744
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,150
I know.

1745
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:02,480
I know you
probably believe that.

1746
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:16,330
Good night, Katherine.

1747
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:18,520
Good night.

1748
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:22,480
Mama!
Hey, babies.

1749
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:24,480
Mama.
Hi.

1750
01:35:25,170 --> 01:35:26,310
Hey.

1751
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:29,520
Oh, please don't tell me
I missed someone's birthday.

1752
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,690
No, you didn't.

1753
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:31,910
No, you didn't, Mama.

1754
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:33,680
Madame, your seat.

1755
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:35,600
Well, thank you.

1756
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,520
Wait, is it my birthday?

1757
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:39,830
No, Mama.

1758
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:42,520
You all look so pretty.

1759
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:47,880
Mama, what's going on?

1760
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:52,360
Good evening, Katherine.

1761
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:59,650
So you're not gonna
say anything?

1762
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,240
It's not my place.

1763
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:04,270
You, either?

1764
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:09,120
Okay, I'm not gonna
do this all night.

1765
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:13,520
Oh, mother of mercy.

1766
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,250
That's for me.

1767
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:20,680
Are you sad, Mama?
No.

1768
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:23,080
It's okay, Mama.
He's a good man.

1769
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:25,000
I know.

1770
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:26,460
I just can't help it.

1771
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,240
He hasn't even asked you yet.

1772
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:31,200
I know, but he is.

1773
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:32,370
You are, right?

1774
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:33,750
If y'all will let me.

1775
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:36,040
Well, go on.
She's already crying.

1776
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:37,560
Oh, hush.

1777
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,770
This was my mother's ring.

1778
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:41,000
It's beautiful.

1779
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:43,210
She and my father
were married for...

1780
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:44,590
For 52 years.

1781
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:48,600
Figure it's about as lucky
a ring as you can get.

1782
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:52,520
The day I met you,
I called my mother

1783
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:55,760
and I said, "Mom, I met the
woman I want to marry."

1784
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:57,120
What'd she say?

1785
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:58,820
She said, "She must be
something, Jimmy.

1786
01:36:58,850 --> 01:36:59,850
"Really something."

1787
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,110
Then what'd you say?

1788
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:02,510
I said, "No.

1789
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:05,600
"She's more than something.

1790
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:07,280
"She's everything."

1791
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:09,130
Now...

1792
01:37:09,970 --> 01:37:11,520
I planned on this being
more romantic.

1793
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:12,940
I'll make that
up to you real soon.

1794
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:14,030
It's okay.

1795
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:17,120
But I know marrying you

1796
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:19,640
includes marrying
your girls as well.

1797
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:23,120
Amen to that.

1798
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:24,810
I do.

1799
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,800
I didn't ask you yet.

1800
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:28,080
Hurry up.

1801
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:32,440
Oh, my goodness.

1802
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:34,290
Oh!

1803
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:39,160
My babies. Look, girls,
isn't it beautiful?

1804
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:41,240
Look, Mama.

1805
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:45,050
The
Mercury-Atlas space vehicle...

1806
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:46,210
which will put John Glenn,

1807
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,850
the first American,
into Earth's orbit...

1808
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:51,080
has already undergone
five unmanned flight tests.

1809
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,250
NASA has confirmed

1810
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:55,080
that the IBM 790
data processing system...

1811
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,400
has been utilized to confirm
all of the mission 's...

1812
01:37:57,570 --> 01:37:59,840
launch and recovery
system calculations.

1813
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:01,770
The modifications
and equipment installations

1814
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,120
are progressing on schedule.

1815
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:05,000
Yes, sir. Right in here.

1816
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:07,690
You wanted to see me, sir?

1817
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:08,850
Have a seat.

1818
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:11,640
Is there something wrong,
Mr. Harrison?

1819
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:13,360
No, there's nothing wrong.

1820
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:16,920
In fact, our IBM
is churning out numbers

1821
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:19,160
in fractions of the time
any human can.

1822
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,000
Present company included.

1823
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:23,160
That's good then.

1824
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:27,190
Maybe.

1825
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:29,690
The thing is,
the Cape's now insisting

1826
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:32,080
on doing all the backups
down there, on site.

1827
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:34,330
I see.

1828
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,360
So we won't be
running backups here.

1829
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:40,360
And truth be told, we can't
keep up with that IBM anyhow.

1830
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:45,560
Long story short,
we no longer need

1831
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:47,200
a computer in this department.

1832
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:50,720
Progress
is a double-edged sword.

1833
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:58,350
Let's have you report back
to the West Group for now.

1834
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:00,320
We'll see if we can find
another assignment.

1835
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:02,360
Thank you, sir.

1836
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:07,250
Katherine, I'm...

1837
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:11,000
I'm sorry about this.

1838
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:14,240
It's out of my hands,
if you can believe that.

1839
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:16,840
I understand.

1840
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:41,090
Katherine.

1841
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:44,920
We heard you got engaged.

1842
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:46,130
Yes.

1843
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:48,040
That's thoughtful of you.

1844
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:56,880
They're lovely.

1845
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:58,880
Mr. Harrison's idea, really.

1846
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:02,400
Although I suspect his
wife did the picking out.

1847
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:05,400
Can't imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers.

1848
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:08,280
Now you have a great wedding.

1849
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:11,800
You did good work
around here, Katherine.

1850
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,140
Hello there.
Good to see you.

1851
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,770
Hi, Reverend. How you doing?
How are you?

1852
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:49,200
I don't think I felt a thing
the first time I did this.

1853
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:50,840
I was so nervous.

1854
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:54,060
You're just as beautiful

1855
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,230
as you were back then.

1856
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:57,040
- You think so?
- Mmm.

1857
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:59,160
Just a little older.

1858
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:01,600
And a little fuller.

1859
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,000
But you look good.

1860
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:09,280
Well, here we go. Again.

1861
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:10,820
Project Mercury...

1862
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:12,200
named after the winged messenger

1863
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,720
of the gods in
Roman mythology. Today,

1864
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:17,370
three years, two months,
and three days afterwards...

1865
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:19,500
we're ready,
after 10 scheduled attempts...

1866
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:21,000
Attagirl.

1867
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:23,040
to try again to put
our first man into orbit...

1868
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:24,840
to put Colonel John Glenn
into orbit.

1869
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:27,490
Colonel John Glenn will be the
first American to orbit the Earth.

1870
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:29,090
As you can see, there are

1871
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:30,410
thousands of people here today

1872
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:32,360
to witness this historic event.

1873
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:34,880
Paul, something's off here.

1874
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:37,200
These landing coordinates
don't match yesterday's.

1875
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:40,880
The IBM just ran them.

1876
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:43,840
Well, then the IBM
was wrong yesterday.

1877
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:45,560
Right?

1878
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:47,880
Or the damn thing's wrong today.

1879
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:53,840
Paul, am I right?

1880
01:41:54,690 --> 01:41:56,240
It appears so.

1881
01:41:58,410 --> 01:42:01,040
The IBM's been spot-on
up to this point, John.

1882
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:03,240
But we'll run it again,
see what it comes up with.

1883
01:42:03,410 --> 01:42:05,120
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you, Al.

1884
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,240
When I fly, I fly the machine.

1885
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:09,760
And right now it seems like
this machine is flying me.

1886
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:11,090
We're on the same page, John.

1887
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:12,400
Our guys are on it.

1888
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,360
Let's get the girl
to check the numbers.

1889
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,880
- The girl?
- Yes, sir.

1890
01:42:18,810 --> 01:42:19,870
You mean Katherine?

1891
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:22,040
Yes, sir. The smart one.

1892
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:24,590
I mean, she says they're good,
I'm ready to go.

1893
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:26,930
All right. We'll get into it.

1894
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:28,310
Roger.

1895
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:31,410
Sam.

1896
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:33,760
Go find Katherine Goble.

1897
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:36,120
She needs to verify
Glenn's "Go/No-go,"

1898
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:37,490
or we're staying on the ground.

1899
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:38,750
Yes, sir.

1900
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:04,160
I'm looking for Katherine Goble.

1901
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:05,510
It's Katherine Johnson now.

1902
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:07,330
They need you to verify
these coordinates.

1903
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:11,000
...and tourists have poured
into Cocoa Beach for weeks.

1904
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,200
Took this whole area
surrounding Cape Canaveral

1905
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:14,800
and Florida, really.

1906
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:17,200
And all around the country,
it's as if time...

1907
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:19,440
All right, give her
some space. Let her work.

1908
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:23,280
...as we await
Colonel John Glenn's launch.

1909
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:25,360
A truly historic day
for America.

1910
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:28,320
The country has waited
for several months,

1911
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:31,520
through many failed unmanned
Atlas rocket tests

1912
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:34,680
and 10 scheduled
manned attempts...

1913
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:36,920
which were canceled
for various mechanical

1914
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,840
or system complications.

1915
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:39,930
Even the weather...

1916
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:41,660
All the final tests and checks

1917
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:42,800
are being conducted.

1918
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:45,680
John Glenn is ready to board
the Friendship 7.

1919
01:43:45,850 --> 01:43:48,080
But today we remain
truly optimistic,

1920
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:50,550
and it's a "Go" day
in all regards.

1921
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:52,320
The capsule is ready.

1922
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:54,200
The rocket itself is A-Okay,

1923
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:56,160
and the weather here
at Cape Canaveral...

1924
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:58,520
Anything from Langley?
Not yet.

1925
01:43:58,690 --> 01:43:59,830
We are being told

1926
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:01,520
that Mission Control at NASA

1927
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:03,920
is conducting
a final check of the launch

1928
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,190
and recovery coordinates.

1929
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:07,880
Including the "Go/No-go"
calculations...

1930
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:09,050
so crucial

1931
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:10,850
to a safe and successful
launch and recovery.

1932
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:13,570
After years of
waiting, and months of delay,

1933
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:16,760
Colonel Glenn is finally ready
for that space flight...

1934
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:19,050
that we've been waiting for
with so much anticipation.

1935
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:21,020
These last-minute
checks could indicate

1936
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:22,920
a hesitancy on NASA's behalf.

1937
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,570
But let us say,
without reservation...

1938
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:27,240
that the safety
of Colonel John Glenn

1939
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:28,610
is paramount to the mission...

1940
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,560
and to the nation itself.

1941
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:31,870
No, sir.
We're still a go.

1942
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,600
Yes, sir.

1943
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:38,370
That's it.

1944
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:45,170
What the devil are you doing?
Are you taking a break?

1945
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:50,560
Yes!

1946
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:53,080
Say yeah

1947
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,400
Yeah

1948
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:56,760
Say, yeah!

1949
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,610
Yeah

1950
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:04,280
Don't you know, we never ever

1951
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:07,280
Never know what makes us major

1952
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:11,240
Your and my alchemy

1953
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,440
Yes, we can

1954
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:15,280
One and one equals three

1955
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:16,590
Yes, we can

1956
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:18,880
I feel it like lightning
in the forest

1957
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:20,450
Yes, we can

1958
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:23,280
Pick a number, pick a note
Harmonize the chords

1959
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:25,520
You're my woman
don't need another

1960
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:27,290
Get behind the other
We can lift each other

1961
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:29,630
It's all very well
that we may never...

1962
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:30,810
Whoo!

1963
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,960
Do you have the time?

1964
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:36,360
Yes, we can

1965
01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:38,680
Like a solar system
they're surrounded by you

1966
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:40,450
Yes, we can

1967
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:43,120
Pick a number, pick a note
Harmonize the chords

1968
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:45,280
You're my woman
don't need another

1969
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:47,280
Get behind the other
we can lift each other

1970
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:49,480
...It's all very well
that we may never...

1971
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:50,770
Whoo!

1972
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:53,040
You're my woman
Don't need another

1973
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:55,480
Get behind the other
We can lift each other

1974
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,120
Whoo!

1975
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:06,530
Sir.

1976
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:12,160
Pad 14.

1977
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:25,210
Katherine.

1978
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:31,490
Come on.

1979
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:36,960
Sir, we've got
Pad 14 on the box.

1980
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:38,730
All right.
Let me in there.

1981
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:44,680
This is Langley, we have
the coordinates confirmed.

1982
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:46,370
Stand by, Langley.

1983
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:49,810
We can confirm...

1984
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,840
the "Go/No-go" point
for re-entry is...

1985
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:58,360
16.11984 degrees latitude...

1986
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:04,080
-165.2356 degrees longitude.

1987
01:47:05,330 --> 01:47:07,040
The launch window is a go.

1988
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:09,200
The landing coordinates match.

1989
01:47:09,410 --> 01:47:11,000
That is very good news, Al.

1990
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:14,330
It's a little hard to trust something
you can't look in the eyes.

1991
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:15,880
That's right, Colonel.

1992
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,760
Katherine did manage
to calculate

1993
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:20,040
a few decimal points further
than that hunk of metal.

1994
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:22,680
I will take every digit you got.

1995
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:23,890
Be sure to thank her for me.

1996
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:26,240
Gentlemen,
let's launch this rocket.

1997
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:27,720
Good luck, Friendship 7.

1998
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:29,360
Godspeed, Langley.

1999
01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:34,080
Here at Cape Canaveral...

2000
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:35,800
the countdown has resumed...

2001
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:37,520
as Colonel John Glenn...

2002
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:39,280
is now aboard
the Friendship 7...

2003
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:41,800
high above the
Atlas rocket on Pad 14.

2004
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:44,560
A height of over 93 feet.

2005
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:45,810
So far, the countdown is...

2006
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:48,270
These are pictures
from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

2007
01:47:48,490 --> 01:47:50,560
The gantry is now moving back.

2008
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:52,440
We are go for launch.

2009
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:55,200
The Mercury
spacecraft umbilical is out.

2010
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:58,080
T-minus 10 seconds,
and counting.

2011
01:47:58,290 --> 01:47:59,540
Water systems, go.
Mercury capsule, go.

2012
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:00,620
Eight, seven...

2013
01:48:00,650 --> 01:48:02,480
Six, five...
Ready engine. Start.

2014
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:03,740
four...

2015
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:05,920
three, two...
Good Lord, ride all the way.

2016
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:08,240
One, zero.

2017
01:48:08,410 --> 01:48:09,600
Ignition.

2018
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:11,750
Lift off.

2019
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:18,120
The M-A 6 vehicle
has lifted off.

2020
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:22,610
It's getting
a little bumpy along here.

2021
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:24,840
Roger that.
You are in Max Q.

2022
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:26,480
Roger that, CAPCOM.

2023
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:28,520
All systems are reported go.

2024
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:30,160
20 seconds to SECO.

2025
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:32,240
The trajectory
is still A-Okay.

2026
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:33,480
Go for SECO.

2027
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:37,120
Roger that, CAPCOM.
Go for SECO.

2028
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:44,200
Zero G and I feel fine.

2029
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:47,160
John Glenn reports
everything looks good.

2030
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:50,480
Oh, that view is tremendous!

2031
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:54,000
Roger that, Friendship 7.

2032
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:00,800
You are go for orbit.

2033
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:02,440
Thank you, CAPCOM.

2034
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,800
All right.
Ten and a half hours to go.

2035
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:11,400
If we make seven round trips.

2036
01:49:12,850 --> 01:49:14,160
I could use a coffee.

2037
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:18,000
Well, as we
approach the end of the day

2038
01:49:18,130 --> 01:49:19,680
here on the Eastern Seaboard...

2039
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:22,560
Colonel Glenn is just
beginning his third orbit...

2040
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:25,240
three-quarters of the way
across the African continent.

2041
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:27,000
We see he's currently
over Zanzibar...

2042
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:29,670
which is the next
tracking station coming up.

2043
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:32,000
Thankfully,
the F riendship 7 capsule is...

2044
01:49:40,850 --> 01:49:42,360
New assignment
came down the pike.

2045
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:48,080
Always changing around here.

2046
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,160
It's hard to keep up.

2047
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:54,220
Seems like they're going
to need a permanent team

2048
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:56,080
to feed that IBM.

2049
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,680
How big of a team?

2050
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:59,760
Thirty, to start.

2051
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:04,760
Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

2052
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:09,360
You're quite welcome,
Mrs. Vaughan.

2053
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:24,720
Hmm.

2054
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:55,760
We have a warning light.

2055
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:58,400
CAPCOM 7,
I have a warning light.

2056
01:50:58,570 --> 01:50:59,710
Stand by, Seven.

2057
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:02,280
Sir, we have a warning light.

2058
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:07,320
What are we looking at, Paul?

2059
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:08,520
Uh...

2060
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:10,640
The heat shield
may have come loose.

2061
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:12,880
Seven, will you confirm
the landing bag

2062
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:13,970
is in the off position?

2063
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:16,480
Affirmative, CAPCOM.

2064
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:17,960
Al, we need to get him down now.

2065
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:19,840
He could burn up
on re-entry.

2066
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:30,640
Come on, babies.

2067
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:31,920
There is a man in space.

2068
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:33,620
And we don't want to miss it,
so we gotta hurry.

2069
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:35,320
Something's wrong with Glenn!

2070
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:36,850
What's going on?
Come on, let's go.

2071
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:39,120
Come on. Hurry up, now.
Y'all follow me.

2072
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:42,680
We just learned
that the Friendship 7...

2073
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:45,840
is in danger of losing
its heat shield.

2074
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:48,040
Have you heard
any banging noises...

2075
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:49,840
or anything of this type
at higher rates?

2076
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:51,360
That is a negative, CAPCOM.

2077
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:53,320
This poses a grave danger
to the mission.

2078
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:57,270
Tell them not to jettison
the retro-package.

2079
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:58,860
NASA is confirming there is

2080
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:00,030
some sort of malfunction

2081
01:52:00,170 --> 01:52:01,300
with the capsule's
heat shield...

2082
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:03,630
and it may not stay in place.

2083
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:05,800
If the heat shield's loose...

2084
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:09,320
the retro-package straps
might hold it in place.

2085
01:52:09,490 --> 01:52:10,520
Will that work?

2086
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:12,360
It will work.

2087
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:15,090
It will hold it until he
reaches the "Go/No-go" point.

2088
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:16,250
It will work.

2089
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:20,400
Al, he has
to override the.05G.

2090
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:21,570
Do it.

2091
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:23,080
Friendship 7...

2092
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:26,080
we're recommending
that the retro-package not...

2093
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:28,320
I repeat, not be jettisoned.

2094
01:52:28,530 --> 01:52:32,360
This means that you will have
to override the. 05G switch.

2095
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,530
Roger.

2096
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:36,030
Is there a reason
for this? Over.

2097
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:37,210
Stand by, Seven.

2098
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:43,710
Not at this time, Seven.

2099
01:52:45,090 --> 01:52:46,520
Roger that, Command.

2100
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:49,200
I will make
a manual.05G entry...

2101
01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:51,710
and bring the scope in. Over.

2102
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:56,560
He knows.

2103
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:05,890
Without a heat shield...

2104
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:07,810
there is no way that
Colonel Glenn can get back

2105
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:09,060
through the Earth's atmosphere.

2106
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:10,760
The heat is simply
too overpowering.

2107
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:13,600
A malfunction in the automatic
control system...

2108
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:17,040
is causing the spacecraft
to yaw in a skid-like fashion.

2109
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:18,880
Thus putting the Friendship 7's

2110
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:21,240
re-entry point in jeopardy.

2111
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:24,760
Even now, Colonel Glenn is streaking
toward the United States.

2112
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:27,390
And he must begin
the retro-sequence

2113
01:53:27,490 --> 01:53:29,320
300 miles west of California...

2114
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:31,120
if he's to reenter
the atmosphere

2115
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:32,430
at the designated point...

2116
01:53:32,610 --> 01:53:34,480
and land in the recovery area

2117
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:37,440
700 miles south
and east of Florida.

2118
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:40,240
Stay tuned to this station
for further details.

2119
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:42,560
You're going to be
using fly-by-wire

2120
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:43,650
for re-entry.

2121
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:46,480
You'll need to maintain
a zero angle, over.

2122
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:48,760
Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire.

2123
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:50,960
Back it up with manual. Over.

2124
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:52,270
Keep talking to him.

2125
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:53,450
Roger.

2126
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,960
The weather,
the recovery area...

2127
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:58,430
three foot waves,
10 miles visibility.

2128
01:53:58,610 --> 01:54:00,960
CAPCOM, you're going out.

2129
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:02,960
He's crossing the
communication blackout zone.

2130
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:07,480
There's a real fireball outside.

2131
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:08,930
It's getting
a little hot in here.

2132
01:54:22,290 --> 01:54:23,600
CAPCOM, do you copy?

2133
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:55,150
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

2134
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:00,370
Again.

2135
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:02,520
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

2136
01:55:17,090 --> 01:55:19,240
Friendship 7,
do you copy? Over.

2137
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:34,800
Loud and clear, CAPCOM.

2138
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:37,160
Roger that.
How are you doing?

2139
01:55:38,730 --> 01:55:41,440
My condition is good.
That was a real fireball. Boy!

2140
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:42,610
Roger that.

2141
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:44,080
Let's get you all the way home.

2142
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:45,410
Roger that.

2143
01:55:45,450 --> 01:55:47,680
Here's hoping these landing
coordinates still hold.

2144
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:52,240
Approaching 16.11984.

2145
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:53,330
Roger.

2146
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:57,400
Approaching
minus 165.2356...

2147
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:00,520
in three, two, one.

2148
01:56:00,730 --> 01:56:02,200
Engaging chutes.

2149
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:05,240
Beautiful chute!

2150
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:07,360
How are we looking, CAPCOM?

2151
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:09,400
Your "'Go/No-go" is good.

2152
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:11,720
Landing coordinates
are spot on, 7.

2153
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:13,490
Roger that, CAPCOM.

2154
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:18,080
I've always wanted to swim
in the Bahamas. Over.

2155
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:25,120
John Glenn has splashed down
and he is being recovered.

2156
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:26,320
Thank you!

2157
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:30,720
John Glenn has
splashed down safely...

2158
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:33,320
and is being recovered
by the USS Noa.

2159
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:38,120
Good job. Great job, guys.

2160
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:39,290
Katherine.

2161
01:56:44,410 --> 01:56:45,410
Nice work.

2162
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:48,160
You too, Mr. Harrison.

2163
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:50,640
So, um...

2164
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:53,840
you think
we can get to the moon?

2165
01:56:55,970 --> 01:56:58,430
We're already there, sir.

2166
01:57:01,970 --> 01:57:02,970
Yeah.

2167
01:57:11,650 --> 01:57:13,120
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2168
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:43,880
Girls, this is
Mrs. Vaughan...

2169
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:45,400
your supervisor.

2170
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:47,000
She'll show you how things work.

2171
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:48,880
Come on in.

2172
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:55,240
The IBM 7090 data
processing system...

2173
01:57:55,370 --> 01:58:00,200
is capable of solving 24,000
multiplications per second.

2174
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:49,600
They'll call it a mystery

2175
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:52,630
But we're gonna call it Victory

2176
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:54,280
We'll be writing history

2177
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:55,960
It's gonna be

2178
01:59:56,330 --> 01:59:57,640
Victory

2179
01:59:57,770 --> 01:59:59,680
They'll be signs on top of signs

2180
01:59:59,770 --> 02:00:01,040
Just so you know the

2181
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:02,560
History

2182
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:04,520
It's saying victory

2183
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:07,640
Is with me

2184
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:10,680
Oh, let them laugh about it

2185
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:13,200
Don't worry
what the doubter's saying

2186
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:15,360
Yes, it's an uphill battle

2187
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:17,790
But guess who else is playin '

2188
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:20,670
The next time y'all in action

2189
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:22,840
And the ghost is in the room

2190
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:25,790
Watch you work
through the masses

2191
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:27,680
You know that we've been used

2192
02:00:27,890 --> 02:00:30,000
Don't let it be

2193
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:32,000
Don't let it be

2194
02:00:32,690 --> 02:00:37,040
No matter how deep

2195
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:42,680
I swear just believe

2196
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:44,720
You'll find victory

2197
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:47,360
Find your victory

2198
02:00:47,690 --> 02:00:49,920
They'll call it a mystery

2199
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:51,880
But we're gonna call it

2200
02:00:52,010 --> 02:00:53,010
Victory

2201
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:55,000
We'll be writing history

2202
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:56,720
It's gonna be

2203
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:58,110
Victory

2204
02:00:58,210 --> 02:01:00,160
They'll be signs on top of signs

2205
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:01,920
Just so you know the

2206
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:03,190
History

2207
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:05,040
It's saying victory

2208
02:01:07,050 --> 02:01:08,760
Is with me

2209
02:01:09,410 --> 02:01:12,000
The Bible says
you should pray for nothing

2210
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:13,960
'Cause every week
it's gonna be something

2211
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:17,000
You know the devil
can't wait to jump in

2212
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:19,080
And complicate
the things you trust in

2213
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:21,510
But I know my foundation

2214
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:24,200
Is solid
and can take some hating

2215
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:27,080
Prayer's gon' be
on this space station

2216
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:29,280
On the way to the master's apron

2217
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:32,040
They'll call it a mystery

2218
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:33,480
Victory

2219
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:35,720
We'll be writing history

2220
02:01:35,810 --> 02:01:36,840
It's gon' be

2221
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:38,560
Victory

2222
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:41,080
It's saying victory

2223
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:43,760
Is with me

2224
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:47,080
Hey!

2225
02:01:47,450 --> 02:01:49,240
Oh

2226
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:01,190
When I first got here

2227
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:03,280
I defined my way

2228
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:05,910
But the end of the days
were dark

2229
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:08,600
When I was not clear

2230
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:10,280
You showed me my mistakes

2231
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:13,440
But told me keep the pace
Don't get lost

2232
02:02:13,610 --> 02:02:18,160
So should I not fear, yeah

2233
02:02:19,090 --> 02:02:21,080
That's how it feels
when you love me

2234
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:23,680
And you're my sightseer

2235
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:25,800
'Cause before I'm in a rut

2236
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:28,880
You multiply by 10 times
what they took from me

2237
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:33,470
You send out a branch
from the longest tree

2238
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:36,640
When I'm in quicksand

2239
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:41,320
But in my mind
it's really your arm to me

2240
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:45,520
Can't believe it, what a
lift and hard to believe

2241
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:48,030
Surrender
But there's a difference

2242
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:50,360
Surrender, surrender

2243
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:53,160
'Cause I understand
Explain to me

2244
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:55,560
There's no coincidence

2245
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:57,680
Just confirmation

2246
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:59,320
Let me see them hands

2247
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:01,920
I was down on myself

2248
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:03,600
And I called you

2249
02:03:03,690 --> 02:03:08,680
And your answer is
"What can I do?"

2250
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:13,000
So much you do for me

2251
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:18,670
In the sound of my breath
seen all the years

2252
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:20,800
Of surrender

2253
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:24,360
Just know I'm here

2254
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:28,680
Reporting for duty

2255
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:32,320
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go

2256
02:03:32,410 --> 02:03:35,560
Don't ever let go, oh

2257
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:39,560
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go

2258
02:03:39,730 --> 02:03:41,240
Don't ever let go, oh

2259
02:03:41,530 --> 02:03:43,200
Don't ever let go, oh

2260
02:03:44,890 --> 02:03:46,030
Hard to believe

2261
02:03:46,330 --> 02:03:48,200
Surrender
but there's a difference

2262
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:50,240
Surrender, surrender

2263
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:53,600
'Cause I understand
Explain to me

2264
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:56,120
There's no coincidence

2265
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,920
Just confirmation

2266
02:03:58,730 --> 02:04:00,320
Let me see them hands

2267
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:01,630
Please, just wave

2268
02:04:01,730 --> 02:04:03,160
Wave, wave

2269
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:06,040
Wave, wave Wave

2270
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:07,350
In this place

2271
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:09,600
Just wave Wave

2272
02:04:09,730 --> 02:04:10,920
Wave your hands

2273
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:13,280
Wave, wave

2274
02:04:18,770 --> 02:04:22,360
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

2275
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:25,920
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

2276
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:29,760
Is it just your love
that's got me going crazy?

2277
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:32,440
Or are my eyes playing with me

2278
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:38,440
All day your love just
comes shining down

2279
02:04:39,410 --> 02:04:42,200
Just like the sweetest bees

2280
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:46,600
I feel you from
my root to my crown

2281
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:51,280
It's mighty good to me
Like caramel

2282
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:53,200
He's right beside me

2283
02:04:53,290 --> 02:04:55,280
My mind's his carousel

2284
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:57,280
It's how he rides me

2285
02:04:57,410 --> 02:04:59,440
So there's no parallels

2286
02:04:59,530 --> 02:05:03,120
Y'all know me very well

2287
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:05,080
It's yellow lightning

2288
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:09,800
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

2289
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:13,760
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

2290
02:05:14,770 --> 02:05:17,800
Is it just your love
that's got me going crazy

2291
02:05:17,930 --> 02:05:20,280
Or are my eyes playing with me

2292
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:22,640
Just like a mirage

2293
02:05:24,410 --> 02:05:28,160
I love you like you were gold

2294
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:30,910
Just like a mirage

2295
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:35,800
I love you like you were gold

2296
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:38,640
Just like a mirage

2297
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:42,760
I love you like you were gold

2298
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:44,600
Gold, gold

2299
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:47,520
And I'm sorry, baby

2300
02:05:47,690 --> 02:05:49,680
For the what ifs, maybes

2301
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:51,600
I've taken too far

2302
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:53,760
I know I must be looking crazy

2303
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:55,760
I'm sorry, baby

2304
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:57,840
For the what ifs, maybes

2305
02:05:57,970 --> 02:05:59,520
I take it too far

2306
02:05:59,730 --> 02:06:02,560
You know I must be looking crazy

2307
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:05,800
Try to understand the way
I've been behaving

2308
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:09,600
It's a funny thing
you really gotta see

2309
02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:13,800
Is it just your love that's
got me going crazy

2310
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:16,320
Or are my eyes playing with me

2311
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:21,840
I spent many nights
on my knees praying

2312
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:25,800
From the side effects
of all this heat

2313
02:06:26,850 --> 02:06:29,880
But I'm telling y'all
it does feel amazing

2314
02:06:30,170 --> 02:06:32,840
Or are my eyes playing with me
