1
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,051
14,15...

2
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,965
16, prime...

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,327
18, prime...

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,405
20...

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,485
21...

6
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,005
22, prime...

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,496
<i>West Virginia
Collegiate Institute</i>

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,171
is the best school for
Negros in the state.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,607
It's the only school
past the eighth grade

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,681
anywhere near here.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,805
Isosceles.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,885
Scalene.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,644
Equilateral.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,720
Rhombus.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,689
Trapezoid.

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,842
Katherine's in the sixth grade.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,056
They want to take her early.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,730
Tetrahedron.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,570
Dodecahedron.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,416
They're offering
a full scholarship.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,930
All you have to do is get there.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,841
Ms. Coleman...

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,723
why don't you solve
the equation on the board?

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,204
<i>We took up a collection</i>

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,691
<i>amongst the teachers and such.</i>

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,841
It's not a lot...

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,127
but it's enough
to help get you settled in.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,521
That's more than kind,
Ms. Sumner.

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,776
<i>If the product of two terms</i>

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,882
is zero then common sense says

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,129
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,204
So if you move all the
terms over to one side,

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,402
you can put the quadratics
into a form

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,720
that can be factored...

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,484
allowing that side
of the equation

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,561
to equal zero.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,856
Once you've done that,
it's pretty straightforward

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,881
from there.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,840
<i>In all my years of teaching.</i>

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,404
<i>I've never seen a mind like
the one your daughter has.</i>

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,401
Katherine!

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,244
Hurry on now, love.

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,290
<i>You have to go.</i>

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,764
Let Mama tuck you in.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,606
<i>You have to see
what she becomes.</i>

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,330
Okay, try to turn it over now.

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,961
Katherine?

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,806
Mary!

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,281
Somebody!

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,401
Katherine!

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,966
Quit staring off into space
and turn the damn car over.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,281
I got it.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,161
I'm not deaf.

54
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,321
I wonder sometimes.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,881
Here it goes.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,802
Yeah, it's the starter.

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,804
That is definitely the starter.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,803
This starter is starting
to make us late.

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
We are all gonna
end up unemployed...

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,881
riding around in this pile
of junk to work every day.

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,809
You're welcome
to walk the 16 miles.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,002
Or sit in the back of the bus.

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,804
I won't do neither.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,686
I'll hitchhike.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,365
Girls.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,605
No crime in a
broken-down car.

67
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,009
No crime being Negro neither.

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,321
Button it up, Mary.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,401
Nobody wants to go to
jail behind your mouth.

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,080
I'll do my best, sugar.

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,241
Not a great place for three of
y'all be having car trouble.

72
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,451
We didn't pick the place,
Officer. It picked us.

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,125
You being disrespectful?

74
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,691
No, sir.

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,440
You have identification on you?

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,090
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

77
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,128
We're just on our way to work...

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,361
at Langley.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,890
NASA, sir.

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,565
We do a great deal
of the calculating.

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,404
Getting our rockets into space.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,090
All three of you?
Yes, sir.

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,241
Yes, Officer.

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,721
NASA.

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,086
Now that's something.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,486
I had no idea they hired...

87
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,247
There are quite a few women
working in the space program.

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,922
Damn Russians are
watching <i>us</i> right now.

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,926
Sputniks.

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,089
You girls ever
meet those astronauts?

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,651
Mercury Seven?

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,251
Absolutely.

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,810
Uh, yes, sir. We work with those
gentlemen all the time.

94
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,161
Those boys are the best
we got. I'm sure of that.

95
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,367
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,216
We gotta get a man up there
before the commies do.

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,241
Yes.
Absolutely.

98
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,776
Whole damn country's
counting on them.

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,926
That's for certain.

100
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,650
Hard being of service
broken down

101
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,489
on the side of the road, though.

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,364
Right, right.

103
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,204
Well, do y'all need a tow
or something?

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,960
No, thank you, Officer.
I think I got it.

105
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,201
Just give me my...

106
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,648
Just need to bypass the starter.

107
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,008
She's good at this stuff.

108
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,762
Whoo! Attagirl.

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,881
We're all set.

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,441
Well, hell, least I can do
is give y'all an escort.

111
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,170
I imagine you're
running late to work.

112
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,004
No, sir. We wouldn't
wanna bother you.

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,446
That would be
wonderful, Officer.

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,006
Thank you so much, sir.

115
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,081
Follow me.

116
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,161
I'm driving.

117
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,016
Hurry up, Dorothy,
before he changes his mind.

118
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,202
- We're coming.
- Hold your horses.

119
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,096
Yes!
Whoa, slow down, Mary!

120
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,610
Mary, slow down!
You're too close!

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,816
Be quiet.
He said to follow him.

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,046
He didn't mean up his behind!

123
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,322
Dear Lord, I don't even
know where to begin!

124
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,845
Oh, I'll tell you
where to begin.

125
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,646
Three Negro women are chasing
a white police officer

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,564
down the highway
in Hampton, Virginia...

127
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,563
1961.

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,566
Ladies, that there
is a God-ordained miracle.

129
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,684
And, tomorrow,
I'm riding the bus.

130
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,769
I'm moving over

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,521
<i>I'm on a sidewalk</i>

132
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,443

134
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,206
Show me.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,526
No, exactly.

136
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,967
<i>40.349110 degrees North.</i>

137

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,084
<i>Boosters have disengaged.</i>

00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,611
<i>Second stage success.</i>

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
Of junk-Sputnik 4 <i>is</i> orbital.

143
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,442
<i>Orbital entry is established.</i>

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,204
<i>Russian orbital entry

145
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,806
Jim Webb.

146
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,570
Yes, Mr. President.

147
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,924
We certainly are, sir.

148
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,924
Uh, it looks like
they've achieved

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,365
at least one orbit, maybe two.

150
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,166
<i>Chernushka is ready to go again.</i>

151
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,803
<i>So is our comrade, Ivan,
a brave space traveler.</i>

152
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,611
<i>We have proven life can
be sustained in space.</i>

153
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,842
<i>Now we will be first
to send a human.</i>

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,004
A damn dog and a damn mannequin.

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,287
And then, a 1.6 megaton RDS-37
thermonuclear warhead...

156
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,161
drops down in the middle
of Des Moines.

157
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,731
Well, that's
a pretty big jump, sir.

158
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,801
What?

159
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,121
Just that...
Who the hell is he?

160
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,328
Paul Stafford, our lead
engineer, Mr. Webb.

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
I think what he meant to say...

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240
is that speculation, at least
on our side of the equation...

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,322
by definition can be...

164
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,130
just a little dangerous.

165
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,327
Dangerous?

166
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,960
You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

167
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,168
Inaction and indecision.

168
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,962
The Russians
have a spy satellite

169
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,041
lapping the planet,

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,282
taking pictures
of God knows what!

171
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,801
The President is demanding
an immediate response.

172
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,530
No more delay.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn,

173
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,776
your uncle Bob,
it doesn't matter.

174
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,881
Get us up there, Harrison.

175
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,247
We can't justify a space program

176
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,687
that doesn't put
anything in space.

177
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,483
How'd that feel in there, Paul?

178
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,642
You think you enlightened
the administrator?

179
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,561
Hmm?

180
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,882
No, he didn't look
enlightened to me.

181
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,004
He look enlightened to you, Sam?

182
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,241
Not particularly.

183
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,481
And just so you know,

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,136
he's not wrong about
what he said in there.

185
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,571
You know that, right?

186
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,444
Because now that
they can get up there,

187
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,681
a bomb will follow.

188
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,687
It's what happens
to all our good ideas.

189
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,083
I imagine theirs too.
Where's...

190
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,726
Where's the machine?

191
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,881
Any day now,
Mr. Harrison.

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,169
Any day now.
Yes, sir.

193
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,681
What's it called?
The initials.

194
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,046
The IBM.

195
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,730
International Business Machines.

196
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,565
Space is a business.

197
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,569
I need a mathematician.

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll put in
another request, sir.

199
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,280
"Another request."
Jesus Christ.

200
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,568
We don't have a single person
in this entire building

201
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,041
that can handle
analytic geometry?

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,280
That's what I've been told.

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,496
Tell me something else, Ruth...

204
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,965
like we're gonna find
such a person

205
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,531
before the Russians plant a flag

206
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,601
on the damn moon.

207
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,761
A real good time.

208
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,000
All right, Gloria.

209
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,680
You'll be with engineering,
building four.

210
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,886
Ladies, ladies.

211
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,576
If you're tardy, you
don't get an assignment.

212
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,696
If you don't get an assignment,

213
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,801
you don't have a job.

214
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,161
Eleanor.

215
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,924
Data Reduction, building 202.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,246
Data Reduction?

217
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,970
You're welcome
to join the charmers

218
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,605
in Magnetoplasma Dynamics.

219
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,921
Oh, no, ma'am.

220
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,487
Thank you. Data
Reduction is just fine.

221
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,165
Mm-hmm.

222
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,571
Mary.
Present.

223
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,166
The Mercury Seven prototype
has arrived for testing.

224
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,288
Mr. Zielinski's
requesting you

225
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,286
for permanent assignment.

226
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,771
Are you serious?

227
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,921
Get moving.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,128
Ooh, thank you, Jesus.

229
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,406
Thank you, Jesus!

230
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,007
Oh, thank you. Mary, Mary.
Keep it inside.

231
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,524
Okay. I'm sorry, Dor.

232
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,285
All right, Ms. Late.

233
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,488
You will also be supporting
the east group.

234
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,330
Mrs. Mitchell.

235
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,448
We're on double-time
this morning, girls.

236
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,921
I need these calculations
before lunch.

237
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,365
Space Task Group
needs a computer, ASAP.

238
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,121
Someone with a handle
on analytic geometry.

239
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,121
We can't fill that position
out of the east group.

240
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,441
Permanent or temp?

241
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,967
Everything's temporary, Dorothy.

242
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,167
You have someone?

243
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,526
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,643
Katherine's the gal for that.

245
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,962
She can handle any numbers
you put in front of her.

246
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,451
I'll check her credentials.

247
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,962
Didn't think I'd come
all the way down here.

248
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,849
Here. Finish passing
those out.

249
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,001
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,610
Mrs. Mitchell.

251
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,761
If I could...

252
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,721
My application
for supervisor, ma'am.

253
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,656
Was just wondering if they're
still considering me

254
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,045
for that position.

255
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,281
Yes.

256
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,522
Well, the official word is no.

257
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,760
They're not assigning a permanent
supervisor for the colored group.

258
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,891
May I ask why?

259
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,530
I don't know why.

260
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,210
I didn't ask why.

261
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,930
We need a supervisor, ma'am.

262
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,082
We haven't had one
since Miss Jansen got sick.

263
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,605
It's been almost a year.

264
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,364
Things are working
just fine as is.

265
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,325
I'm doing the work
of a supervisor.

266
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,847
Well, that's NASA for you.

267
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,331
Fast with rocket ships,
slow with advancement.

268
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,161
Get those trajectory
I'll check worked out.

269
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,964
We need them
for the Redstone test.

270
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,845
<i>Mach one tunnel test.
T-minus one minute.</i>

271
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,488
<i>No shoe is worth your life.</i>

272
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,801
One moment.

273
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,887
T-minus 10, 9...

274
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,326
<i>8...</i>

275
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
<i>7...</i>

276
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,284
<i>6, 5, 4...</i>

277
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,966
Shut it down.

278
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,045
If we alter the exterior
from smooth to corrugated...

279
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,806
the capsule might have
more stability.

280
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,248
But the friction, it is
under during re-entry...

281
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,609
Most shield erosion occurs

282
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,684
on the posterior side
abutting the retro-boosters.

283
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,846
Conclusion?

284
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,369
The area closest to the boosters

285
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,805
is closest to the heat.

286
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,921
Coupled with rising
temperature on re-entry...

287
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,684
the contact softens.

288
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,968
We could consider
another fastener

289
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,371
other than the bolts.

290
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,561
Yes.

291
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,966
Yes.

292
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,641
There is another opening

293
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,529
in the Engineer
Training Program.

294
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,887
Flat head rivets
would reduce wind drag.

295
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,771
Mary, a person
with engineer's mind

296
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,365
should be an engineer.

297
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,360
You can't be a computer
the rest of your life.

298
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,681
Mr. Zielinski...

299
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,004
I'm a Negro woman.

300
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,003
I'm not gonna entertain
the impossible.

301
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,650
And I'm a Polish Jew

302
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,722
whose parents died
in a Nazi prison camp.

303
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,929
Now I'm standing
beneath a spaceship

304
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,050
that's going to carry an
astronaut to the stars.

305
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,687
I think we can say we are
living the impossible.

306
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,209
Let me ask you...

307
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,805
if you were a white male,

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,405
would you wish
to be an engineer?

309
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,968
I wouldn't have to.
I'd already be one.

310
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,363
<i>Skirts must be worn
past the knee.</i>

311
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,727
Sweaters are preferred
to blouses.

312
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,927
No jewelry.

313
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,128
A simple pearl necklace
is the exception.

314
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,045
Your supervisor
is Mr. Al Harrison,

315
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,362
Director of
the Space Task Group.

316
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,803
You'll write research, proof
calculations, so forth.

317
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,770
Do not talk to Mr. Harrison
unless he talks to you.

318
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,046
Not many computers last
more than a few days.

319
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,248
He's been through a dozen
in as many months.

320
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,246
Come on, keep up.

321
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,245
Things move fast around here.

322
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,891
Your clearance.

323
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,846
They've never had a colored
in here before, Katherine.

324
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,201
Don't embarrass me.

325
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,691
This wasn't emptied last night.

326
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,569
I'm sorry, I'm not the...

327
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,766
custodian.

328
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,441
Excuse me, ma'am.

329
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,648
Mr. Harrison's computer
reporting.

330
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,491
Take the desk in the back.
I'll get you work in a bit.

331
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,049
Mr. Harrison won't warm up
to you. Don't expect it.

332
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,520
Do your work,
keep your head down.

333
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,281
Thank you.

334
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,524
Go on. Get settled.

335
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,841
Paul.

336
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,249
Why are we still losing shingles

337
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,566
off the heat shield?

338
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,087
We're working with a prototype
of the capsule, Al.

339
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,056
Its lid is one third the
size of what it's going...

340
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,081
I get that.

341
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,684
So, what do we do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

342
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,121
Turn it down?
No, Al. I don't think...

343
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,681
It was a joke.

344
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,929
Paul, if the heat shield
comes off...

345
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
what do you think happens
to our astronaut?

346
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,841
I know.

347
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
So we're gonna come up
with a solve, right?

348
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
Yes, sir.
We're working on it.

349
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,689
Ruth, what's the status
on that computer?

350
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,842
She's right behind you,
Mr. Harrison.

351
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,361
Does she handle
Analytic Geometry?

352
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,410
Absolutely.
And she speaks.

353
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,800
Yes, sir. I do.

354
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,570
Which one?
Both.

355
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,210
Geometry and speaking.

356
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,448
Ruth, get me the...

357
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,561
You think you...

358
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,056
You think you can find me
the Frenet frame

359
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,081
for this data?

360
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,526
Using the Gram-Schmidt...

361
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,688
Orthogonalization algorithm.
Yes, sir.

362
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,491
I prefer it over
Euclidean coordinates.

363
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,051
Okay, good.

364
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Good, then I'm gonna need
it by the end of the day.

365
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,286
Yes.

366
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,601
I'm also gonna ask you

367
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,761
to check
Mr. Stafford's math

368
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,285
as well as others' on this floor

369
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,441
from time to time.

370
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,601
I can handle that, Al.

371
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,649
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

372
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,290
But if that were the case

373
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,976
shingles wouldn't be flying
off the heat shield,

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,001
now would they?

375
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,889
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention

376
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,041
for a moment?

377
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,650
Thank you.

378
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,811
Just to be clear...

379
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,850
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven
will be here for training.

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,844
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,843
asking us questions
about our work.

382
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,131
I think that's pretty reasonable

383
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,248
given we're putting a human
on top of a missile,

384
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,441
shooting him into space,

385
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,965
and it's never been done before.

386
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
Because it's never been done,

387
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,321
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter.

388
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,564
It's gonna matter
to their wives...

389
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,285
to their children.

390
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,080
I believe it's gonna matter
to the whole damn country.

391
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,121
So this Space Task Group
will be as advertised.

392
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,523
America's greatest engineering
and scientific minds

393
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,251
are not gonna have a problem

394
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,766
with having their work checked.
Are they, Paul?

395
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,207
No, sir.

396
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,283
Good. So let's have
an amen, damn it.

397
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,441
Amen.

398
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,162
Amen!

399
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,961
All right.

400
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,170
My numbers are spot on.

401
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,087
I will double check them, sir.
No problem.

402
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,561
Uh...

403
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,776
I'm not gonna be able to...
Work on what you can read.

404
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,565
The rest is classified.
You don't have clearance.

405
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,927
These are the numbers
Mr. Harrison gave me.

406
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,048
Yes, I'm absolutely...
Excuse me.

407
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,690
May I ask
where the ladies' room is?

408
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,360
Sorry. I have no idea
where your bathroom is.

409
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,650
Yes, sir.

410
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,209
Uh, yes, sir.

411
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,806
<i>Summertime in
Virginia was an oven</i>

412
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,122
<i>All the kids eating
ice cream with their cousins</i>

413
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,846
<i>I was studyin' while you
was playing the dozens</i>

414
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,526
<i>Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't</i>

415
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,329
<i>Runnin' from the man</i>

416
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,640
<i>Runnin' from the badge</i>

417
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,167
<i>Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't</i>

418
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,170
<i>Runnin' toward our plans</i>

419
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,685
<i>And the judges hands</i>

420
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,848
<i>Don't act like you was there
when you wasn't</i>

421
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,526
<i>I know they say
you crawl before you walk</i>

422
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,125
<i>But in my mind I already jog</i>

423
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,650
<i>If I stand still
I cannot get far</i>

424
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,448
<i>They want the moon I'm on Mars</i>

425
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,845
<i>Sometime my mind dives deep
when I'm runnin'</i>

426
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,600
<i>Together we'll fly
But no more runnin'</i>

427
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,041
Ruth!

428
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,201
Yes, Mr. Harrison?

429
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,007
Ruth, where's that girl
with the numbers?

430
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,288
On a... break.

431
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,447
We take breaks now?

432
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,726
<i>Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'</i>

433
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,411
<i>I don't want no free ride</i>

434
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,811
<i>I'm just sick and tired
of runnin'</i>

435
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,087
<i>Together we fly
But no more runnin'</i>

436
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,526
My God, where have you been?

437
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,881
Are you finished yet?

438
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,087
Uh...

439
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,844
Almost. He said
by the end of the day.

440
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,809
The end of the day around
here was yesterday.

441
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,486
I need those done first.

442
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,005
He wants those done first. Okay.

443
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,161
Get going-

444
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,441
I'm sorry about that.

445
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,850
Somebody's working on it
right now.

446
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,761
Mr. Harrison.

447
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,602
Yeah. Uh, Just set it...
You know.

448
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,842
And Stafford's
heat shield PHARRELL?

449
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,004
It's hard to be sure, sir.

450
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,165
Hard to be sure.

451
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,650
You know what we're doing here?

452
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,203
Trying to put
a man into space, sir.

453
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,566
That's right.

454
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,483
That's right. So you can
throw that in the trash.

455
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,926
Excuse me?

456
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,608
I said you can throw it away.

457
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,121
Here.

458
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,730
It's not an insult to your work.

459
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,445
It's just obsolete.

460
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,841
That's how fast things
are moving around here.

461
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,367
If I said I was sorry,
I'd be saying it all day.

462
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,321
What I'm asking you to do,

463
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,970
what I'm asking everyone
in that room...

464
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,202
all my geniuses...

465
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,044
is to look beyond the numbers.

466
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,888
To look around them.

467
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,690
Through them.

468
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,081
For answers to questions
we don't even know to ask.

469
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,928
Math that doesn't yet exist.

470
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,841
Because without it,
we're not going anywhere.

471
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,764
We're staying on the ground.

472
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,491
We're not flying into space.
We're not circling the Earth.

473
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,369
And we're certainly not
touching the Moon.

474
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,726
And in my mind...

475
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,287
In my mind, I'm already there.

476
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,521
Are you?

477
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,241
Yes, sir.

478
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,400
Good.

479
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,936
Because I don't need
another smart girl

480
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,200
with an adding machine.

481
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,885
Can I go, sir?

482
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,969
Yeah, go.

483
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,651
Yes, you can go.

484
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,163
We've been waiting for hours.
Next time, you take the bus.

485
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,560
She's in a mood.

486
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,849
<i>People talkin'
tryin' to break us up</i>

487
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,130
<i>Why won't they let us be?</i>

488
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,766
<i>Brick and stones
may break my bones</i>

489
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,842
<i>But talk don't bother me</i>

490
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,049
<i>I've been abused</i>

491
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,571
<i>In my heart</i>

492
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,567
I haven't been late
one day in 10 years.

493
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,371
Haven't been out sick.
Haven't complained.

494
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,521
My work's on time.

495
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,011
It's done right.
It's done well.

496
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,525
It's not fair, that's a fact.

497
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,205
What's not fair is having

498
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,416
the responsibility
of a supervisor...

499
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,249
- but not the title or the pay.
- Mmm.

500
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,241
Watching you two move on.

501
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,009
Now, don't get me wrong.

502
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,731
Any upward movement
is movement for us all.

503
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,889
Just isn't movement for me.

504
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,041
Truth be told, Dorothy...

505
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,441
I don't even know
if I can keep up in that room.

506
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,886
I'll be back with
the computers in a week.

507
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,804
Or out of a job entirely.

508
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,007
Oh, please.

509
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,816
You're better with the numbers
than anyone in there,

510
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,920
Katherine, and you know it.

511
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,136
Just make that pencil move
as fast as your mind does...

512
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,650
you'll be fine.

513
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,689
And you, have some respect.

514
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,490
Get your damn feet
off my dashboard.

515
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,686
This isn't your living room.

516
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,804
I sound like a supervisor,
don't I?

517
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,530
A mean old salty one.

518
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,523
Riddled with authority,
no question.

519
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,764
You don't mess
with Mrs. Vaughan.

520
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,451
Turn that music up.

521
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,120
Good night, Katherine.

522
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,241
Bye, Kat.

523
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,321
Good night, ladies.

524
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,720
- See you in the morning.
- Bye.

525
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,561
Hey, baby.

526
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,801
Hello, Mama.

527
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,131
I was fixing to call
the National Guard.

528
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,921
Sorry, Mama.
New assignment.

529
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,889
Space Task Group.

530
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,042
Oh, my word.
That sounds important.

531
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,884
It's a promotion?

532
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,885
It might be a slight promotion.

533
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,011
But you want the job, right?

534
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,490
I think so.

535
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,404
It's a challenge, but...

536
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,648
It's nothing you
can't handle, Katherine.

537
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,250
Thank you, Mama.

538
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,921
Are they asleep yet?

539
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,724
They're pretending to be.

540
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,042
- What are you doing?
- I don't...

541
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,884
They're not pretending
well enough.

542
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,961
Constance!

543
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,929
Thank you, Mama.
Love you.

544
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,445
This is my bed.
No.

545
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,521
Get off!

546
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,011
Go back to yours!
I'm oldest! No.

547
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,376
- What are you doing?
- Get off!

548
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,640
What are you doing?

549
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,371
It's not fair how Joylette
gets to sleep by herself

550
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,210
because she's the oldest.

551
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,805
Yes, it is fair.
No, it's not.

552
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,456
- Yes, it is.
- Nuh-uh.

553
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,721
Constance, Kathy, sit.

554
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,042
Now, I understand...

555
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,925
you want to be grown
and have your own space.

556
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,768
So, whoever sleeps in that bed,

557
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,484
in Joylette's place...

558
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,404
will also do the dishes...

559
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,324
take out the trash...

560
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,448
and do all of Joylette's chores.

561
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,441
That's okay. Never mind.

562
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,329
Yeah, she's not so
terrible to share with.

563
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Okay.

564
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,171
Then don't let me come home

565
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,288
and find you like
this again, you hear me?

566
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,920
You're supposed to been
asleep a long time ago.

567
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,605
We just wanted to say goodnight.

568
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,331
You've been gone for 300 hours.

569
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,648
I know. I work a
full-time job now.

570
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,325
You all know that.

571
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,090
I have to be Mommy and Daddy.

572
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,522
I miss your father
just as much as anyone.

573
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,487
He's with the angels.

574
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,608
Yes, he's with all the angels.

575
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,444
And he's watching over us.

576
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,887
Every minute, okay?

577
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,441
That's why we have to be strong.

578
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,521
All right?

579
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,965
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.

580
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,485
Y'all get some rest, okay?

581
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,041
Mama?

582
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,121
Yes, baby?

583
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,041
Are the Russians fixin'
to attack us?

584
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,801
Where'd you get that from?

585
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,440
We had to hide under
our desks today“.

586
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,401
All scrunched up.

587
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,048
Okay, baby,
that's called a drill.

588
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,690
It means, uh...

589
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,330
you practice safety

590
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,801
just in case something happens.

591
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,244
Truth is, we don't know
what they're doing up there.

592
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,890
You going to space, too?

593
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,491
No, baby.

594
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,803
But I'm going to do what I can

595
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,004
to help those brave men
get there. Yes, I am.

596
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,004
You could fly up to space
if you wanted to, Mama.

597
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,650
You could be an astronaut.

598
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,729
Did you draw this?
Yes, Mama.

599
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,042
Is that me?

600
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,201
Mmm-hmm.

601
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,081
You see this?

602
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,164
Oh, my goodness.

603
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,924
I love you, baby.

604
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,001
I know.

605
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,571
Come here.

606
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,087
All right. Now this time
really go to bed.

607
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,681
Okay?

608
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,569
I love y'all.
Good night.

609
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,840
Good night.
Good night, Mama.

610
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,848
I love my picture, baby.

611
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,726
Thank you, Lord.

612
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,083
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

613
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,368
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

614
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,521
Hallelujah.

615
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,371
Praise God...

616
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,091
that change is coming.

617
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,402
From the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference...

618
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,562
to the good reverend
Dr. King...

619
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,051
Amen!
Hallelujah!

620
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,407
To the students sitting in
at lunch counters

621
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,481
in North Carolina.

622
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,641
That's right.
Yes, sir.

623
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,604
His faith in us has no limit.

624
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,608
The good Lord
has our very own women

625
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,410
working on rocket ships.

626
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,609
And we have National Guardsmen

627
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,961
defending our freedom.

628
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,407
Give a shout of praise
for Colonel Jim Johnson.

629
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,083
Returning home,
by the grace of God

630
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,607
to set up a National Guard unit

631
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,246
right here in Hampton.

632
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,685
Can I get a hallelujah in here?

633
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,842
Hallelujah!

634
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,491
I just don't understand.

635
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,645
I don't understand it.

636
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,440
I don't wanna talk
about this again, okay?

637
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,205
A female engineer?

638
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,361
A female engineer?

639
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,046
We're Negro, baby.

640
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,480
Ain't no such thing.
Understand it.

641
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,965
It's not like that there, Levi.

642
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,451
You can't apply for freedom.

643
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,331
Freedom is never granted
to the oppressed.

644
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,005
It's got
to be demanded. Taken.

645
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,003
Stop quoting your slogans at me.

646
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,807
There is more than one way
to achieve something.

647
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I don't want any greens.

648
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,968
Hey. I tell you
about interrupting?

649
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,804
Here. Try this, baby.

650
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,881
Yes.

651
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,769
You're gonna eat
them greens, too.

652
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,808
Kids need
to eat their vegetables.

653
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,689
You'd know that
if you was ever home.

654
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,963
You better settle down,
Levi Jackson.

655
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,804
Unless you want
this female's mind,

656
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,882
right here,
in front of everybody.

657
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,405
All I'm saying...

658
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,324
don't play the fool.

659
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,323
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

660
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,403
NASA's never ever
given you guys your due.

661
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,925
Having a couple of extra degrees

662
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,161
ain't gonna change that.

663
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,842
Civil rights ain't always civil.

664
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,164
I don't want any greens either.

665
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,367
No lip, little miss.

666
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
Your brother gets them,
and so do you.

667
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,407
I hear he's planning
on staying in the area.

668
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,763
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's good for him.

669
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,400
Katherine, go find
your way over there.

670
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,609
That Colonel Jim
is a tall glass of water.

671
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,046
That he is.

672
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,766
Tall, strong, commanding.

673
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,207
And I bet he's like that
day and night.

674
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,966
Mary, it's Sunday.

675
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,451
Please have some shame.

676
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,886
I will not.

677
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,080
Hmm, I think he's
smiling over here.

678
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,446
At you.

679
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,120
Well I'm not smiling back.

680
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,247
Yes, you are.
Oh, child.

681
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,163
You are all teeth right now.
I am not.

682
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
Come over here.

683
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
He's coming over.

684
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,576
Now, why would he be doing that?

685
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
- 'Cause Mary's waving at him.
- No!

686
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,096
Ladies, I'm not ready. It's too late.
Fix your hair.

687
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,121
Hello, Colonel.

688
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,406
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

689
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,696
That's Mary Jackson. I believe
you met her husband, Levi.

690
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,245
Yes, ma'am.
Good to meet y'all.

691
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,765
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

692
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,729
She's not married.
She's a widow...

693
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,087
with three beautiful
little girls.

694
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,241
So well behaved.

695
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,562
Angels on earth is what
we like to call them.

696
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,404
Dorothy, slice of pie?

697
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,085
I'd love one.

698
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,730
Excuse me.

699
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,056
You already have
a slice of pie...

700
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,081
Uh-huh.

701
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,411
I was just, uh, fixing my
three babies some plates...

702
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,806
Let me help you.

703
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Sure.

704
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,162
Fruit salad.
Mmm-hmm.

705
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,530
Pastor mentioned you're
a computer at NASA.

706
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Yes.

707
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,005
What's that entail?

708
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,601
Oh.

709
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,922
We calculate
the mathematics necessary

710
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,651
to enable launch and landing
for the space program.

711
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,321
That's pretty heady stuff.

712
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,527
Yes, it is.

713
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,409
They let women
handle that sort of...

714
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,481
Uh...

715
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,001
That's not what I mean.

716
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,491
What do you mean?

717
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,603
I'm just surprised
that something so...

718
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,726
taxing...
Mmm-hmm.

719
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,325
Mr. Johnson.

720
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,647
If I were you, I'd quit
talking right now.

721
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,040
I didn't mean no disrespect.

722
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,566
I will have you know

723
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,802
I was the first
Negro female student

724
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,167
at West Virginia University
Graduate School.

725
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,120
On any given day...

726
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,402
I analyze the manometer levels

727
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,960
for air displacement,
friction, and velocity

728
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,606
and compute
over 10,000 calculations

729
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,409
by cosine, square root...

730
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,608
and, lately, analytic geometry.

731
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,681
By hand.

732
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,771
There are 20 bright,
highly capable

733
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,689
Negro women
in the West Computing Group.

734
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,326
And we're proud to be doing
our part for the country.

735
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,161
So, yes.

736
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,721
They let women do some things
at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

737
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,687
And it's not because
we wear skirts.

738
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,242
It's because we wear glasses.

739
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,890
Have a good day.

740
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,206
Scott, welcome to Langley.

741
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,686
Welcome to Langley.
Welcome.

742
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,204
Good to have
you here, gentlemen.

743
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,566
Thank you.

744
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,411
That's Alan Shepard,
U.S. Navy pilot.

745
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,403
He could be the
first man in space.

746
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,251
And that's Scott Carpenter
and Walter Schirra...

747
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,970
also Navy pilots.

748
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,885
All under 5' 11", 180 pounds.

749
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,644
IQ's over 130.
Mmm.

750
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,723
And handsome must be
a requirement too.

751
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,611
How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

752
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,761
It's equal rights.

753
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,882
I have the right to see
fine in every color.

754
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,202
And that's John Glenn. He's
the only Marine Corps pilot.

755
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,888
Gentlemen, if we may,
much to see around here.

756
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,960
Well, heck, we haven't
shaken all the hands yet.

757
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,640
We have a fairly tight
itinerary, Colonel.

758
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,721
Ruth, he's fine.

759
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,216
He's coming this way.
Look straight ahead.

760
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,241
I'm looking right at him.

761
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,404
Ladies, I didn't wanna run
off without saying hello.

762
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,085
Seem to be in a big
rush around here.

763
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,163
The Russians certainly
aren't slowing down any.

764
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,924
They can't build
a damn refrigerator.

765
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,600
How the heck did they
beat us into space?

766
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,216
And what do you ladies do
for NASA?

767
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,811
Calculate your trajectories.
Launch and landing.

768
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,976
You can't get anywhere
without the numbers.

769
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,001
No, sir.

770
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,968
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn.
Engineering.

771
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,576
And I'm proud as the devil
to be working with you.

772
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,761
Thank you, Mary.

773
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,841
John.

774
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,770
John, let's take it inside.
Yes, sir.

775
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,570
Guys.
Nice meeting you guys.

776
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,200
Thank you, Colonel.
Good luck, sir.

777
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,611
God bless you all.

778
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,806
Thank you. That's wonderful.

779
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,601
Thank you!

780
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,531
Mr. Harrison wants you
to confirm

781
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,331
launch and landing for the
Redstone rocket test.

782
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,563
I cannot work on what
I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.

783
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,801
It's illegible.

784
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,604
Those numbers have
already been confirmed

785
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,569
by two engineers in this
department and myself.

786
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,768
This is more or less
a dummy check.

787
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
You have one, we make it two.
Make it double, okay?

788
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,209
We gotta get it.
Just make it happen.

789
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,247
No one thought to measure
these things?

790
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,050
I'm afraid not, sir.

791
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,568
Well, would you like us to stop?

792
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,722
No. No, just...

793
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,806
Actually, no.
Just keep going.

794
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,451
In fact, use the big hammer.

795
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,601
Yes, sir.

796
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,856
Come on, use the big hammer.
You heard the man. Let's go.

797
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,881
Watch out.

798
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,921
Ma'am.

799
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,521
Our runner can pick up
your work, Dorothy.

800
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,164
You need to be working,
not walking.

801
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,608
Oh, it's break time, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

802
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,444
Since you made the trip...

803
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,728
you can take that batch
over there.

804
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,289
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

805
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,487
You need something else?
Yes, ma'am.

806
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,976
I was wondering if you know
what they're building

807
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,001
over in the tech wing.

808
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,962
It's called an IBM.

809
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,610
A mainframe machine.

810
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,845
Apparently, it can
do our calculations

811
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,000
in a fraction of the time.

812
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,681
Hmm.

813
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,964
I guess that's good for NASA.

814
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,488
Hurry on, now. Best if
you do it in one trip.

815
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,241
Excuse me.

816
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,441
Hi.

817
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,764
What are you looking at, Paul?

818
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,525
Is that correct?

819
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,961
Yeah.

820
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,807
Whose work is that?

821
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,883
I said, whose work is that?

822
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,484
Katherine Goble, sir.

823
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Hello.
Hi.

824
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,456
How did you know the Redstone

825
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,050
couldn't support orbital flight?

826
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,376
That's classified information.

827
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,401
It's top secret.

828
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,247
It's no secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing.

829
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,890
It's fine
for sub-orbital flight

830
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,088
but it can't handle
the weight of the capsule

831
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,241
and push it into space.

832
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,405
Numbers don't lie.

833
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,322
And you figured
all that out with this?

834
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,923
Half the data is redacted.

835
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,168
But what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

836
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,004
The distance from launch
to orbit, we know.

837
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,366
Redstone mass, we know.

838
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,408
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

839
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,410
And the speeds are there
in the data.

840
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,250
You did the math.

841
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,641
Yes, sir.

842
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,283
I looked beyond.

843
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,761
How do you know
about the Atlas rocket?

844
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,762
That's not math.

845
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,001
That data is not here.

846
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,804
Like you said, it's classified.

847
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,769
I held it up to the light.

848
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,291
You held it up to the light?

849
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,521
Yes, sir.

850
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,801
Well, there it is.

851
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,961
Mmm-hmm.

852
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,281
Atlas.

853
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,281
What's your name?

854
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,965
Katherine Goble.

855
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,645
Are you a spy, Katherine?

856
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Am I what?

857
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,040
I said, are you a Russian spy?

858
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,485
No, sir.

859
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,005
I'm not Russian.

860
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,170
She's not Russian, sir.

861
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,803
All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

862
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,016
Give her everything she needs

863
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,296
to work on Shepard's
trajectories.

864
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,402
Without redaction.
Are we clear on that?

865
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,846
Are we sure about this?

866
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,041
What's the issue, Paul?

867
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,645
You heard her.

868
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,801
She's not a spy.

869
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,244
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

870
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,086
You know what I think's
a good idea? Darker ink.

871
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,520
I think darker ink's
a good idea.

872
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,736
Ruth, could you pass it along?

873
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,761
Yes, sir.

874
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,001
Thank you, Katherine.

875
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,321
Thank you, sir.

876
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,842
This interrogation's over.

877
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,562
You can probably get to the
moon and back with this.

878
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,131
Just not the bathroom.

879
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,442
At least they're not
blind of what you do.

880
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,681
It's not gonna matter soon.

881
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,486
This IBM's gonna
put us all out of work.

882
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,563
How you doing?
What can we do about it?

883
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,282
Only one thing to do.

884
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,169
Learn all we can,
make ourselves valuable.

885
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,216
Somewhere down the line,
a human being

886
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,536
is gonna have
to push the buttons.

887
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,971
That's right.

888
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,730
Oh, mercy.

889
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,484
Well, she must be lost.

890
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,856
NASA doesn't commission females

891
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,200
for the Engineer
Training Program.

892
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,121
That position is available
to any qualified applicant.

893
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,090
Right. Except, you don't have
the educational requirements.

894
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,321
I have a bachelor's degree

895
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,736
in mathematics
and physical science.

896
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,649
It's the same <i>as</i> most
engineers around here.

897
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,326
We now require advanced
extension courses

898
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,925
through the University
of Virginia.

899
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,287
It's in the employee
handbook. In addendum.

900
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,680
In case you haven't read it.

901
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,482
Every time we have a chance
to get ahead...

902
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,841
they move the finish line.

903
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,411
I just follow the rules
around here.

904
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,125
And I expect everyone
who works for me

905
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,241
to follow them as well.

906
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,609
There are no special
circumstances for anyone.

907
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,242
Y'all should be thankful
you have jobs at all.

908
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,562
"For those that cannot attend classes
at the University of Virginia...

909
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,121
"advanced extension courses
are available

910
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,089
"at the Hampton High School."

911
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,087
That's still a
segregated school, Mary.

912
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,720
Virginia acts like Brown
versus Board of Education

913
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,801
<i>never happened.</i>

914
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,287
They are never gonna
allow a colored woman

915
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,442
to just take classes
at an all-white school.

916
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,409
Well, sounds about right.

917
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,289
That's all you gonna say?

918
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,096
I'm not gonna sit here all day
and listen to you complain

919
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,326
about the way things are.

920
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,560
We're trying to play cards.

921
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,296
Petition the court.
Fight for what you want.

922
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,810
But quit talking about it.

923
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,450
I've been complaining?
For days.

924
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,601
Ladies.

925
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,928
Not one more peep about work.

926
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,161
Deal me in.

927
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Katherine?

928
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,731
- Come on.
- Oh, no.

929
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,921
Right here.
You.

930
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,969
Child, I needed this.

931
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,161
Thank you.

932
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,847
Don't give her
anymore, Katherine.

933
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,168
I can't. She drank it all.

934
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,607
Listen, I'm fine.

935
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,649
I'm as fine as I have ever been.

936
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,604
You're drunk
as you've ever been.

937
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,525
Come on. Let's dance, ladies.

938
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,446
Come on, Kat. Let's dance.

939
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,920
Go and dance with her,
Katherine.

940
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,405
Come on.
Get out here.

941
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,606
Hide that.

942
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,776
We gonna teach you how to dance.

943
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,801
You go ahead.

944
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,848
All right.
It's too low.

945
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,650
We gonna teach you
how to get a man.

946
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,643
Teach me? What? MARY: That's right.
Come on!

947
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,370
You got to know how to dance.

948
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,010
Slow. Slow.
Come on.

949
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,128
Twirl it around.
Twirl, twirl.

950
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,448
Yes!
Twirl, twirl, twirl.

951
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,204
Whoo! Look at her,
Dorothy.

952
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,362
Can I win me one of those
fancy dance contests?

953
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,806
Whip it around.

954
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,376
Yeah, and on the outside.

955
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,686
Was it better than Mama's?

956
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,166
No, not really.

957
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,840
Segregation must go!

958
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,722
Segregation must go!

959
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,928
Segregation must go!

960
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,889
Segregation must go!

961
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,376
Don't pay attention to all that.

962
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,890
We're not part
of that trouble. Go on.

963
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,887
"Mind. They must have done..."

964
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,561
We don't want any trouble
in here.

965
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,368
Oh, I'm not here
for any trouble, ma'am.

966
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,601
What are you here for?

967
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,401
A book.

968
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,927
You have books
in the colored section.

969
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,924
It doesn't have
what I'm looking for.

970
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,242
That's just the way it is.

971
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,736
Go on, now.
You know better than this.

972
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,081
Get your hands off my boys!
Don't touch them.

973
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,044
You have a blessed day.

974
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,928
Separate and equal
are two different things.

975
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,646
Just 'cause it's the way,
doesn't make it right.

976
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,926
Understand?

977
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
Yes, Mama.

978
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,287
You act right, you are right.

979
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,090
That's for certain.

980
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,241
Understand?

981
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,447
Yes, Mama.

982
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,324
You took that book, Mama?

983
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,448
Son, I pay taxes.

984
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,642
And taxes pay for everything
in that library.

985
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,802
Can't take something
you already paid for.

986
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,962
"Fortran is a new
and exciting language...

987
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,488
"used by programmers
to communicate with computers.

988
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,962
"It is exciting, as it is
the wave of the future."

989
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,450
All right, everybody smile.

990
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,080
- Everybody smile.
- Aw!

991
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,481
Make a wish.
Make a wish.

992
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,130
Blow. Try again.

993
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,805
There you go.

994
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,963
Leonard, you need
to get you a job now.

995
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,081
Two jobs.

996
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,856
Your baby is nine.
What are you gonna do?

997
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,496
Thank you, man.
Yeah, you're just in time.

998
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,851
Look at that.

999
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,002
Look at what?
What a surprise.

1000
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,685
Can't complain, man.

1001
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,484
I'll say.

1002
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,682
Howard must have invited him.
Mmm-hmm.

1003
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,567
Let me go help them
with those flowers.

1004
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,163
Walter, you behave yourself.

1005
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,800
Now, you know, I'm just... Yeah.

1006
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,409
That's right, baby.
Shake it.

1007
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,203
Yeah. There you go.

1008
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,207
Good to see you.
Yes. Thank you.

1009
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,888
I believe I owe you an apology.

1010
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,521
Well, was that it?

1011
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,004
Can I make it while we dance?

1012
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,611
I'm afraid I simply misspoke
the other day, Mrs. Goble.

1013
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,121
I've been away for a long time.

1014
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,884
I imagine I'm just
out of practice.

1015
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,766
Mmm-hmm.

1016
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,806
I was hoping you'd allow
me to start over.

1017
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,241
Mmm-hmm.

1018
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,610
See, the thing is...

1019
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,680
I have an interest in
getting to know you better.

1020
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,281
Mmm-hmm.

1021
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,930
You're one tough customer, huh?

1022
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,169
You haven't said
you're sorry yet.

1023
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,560
Right.

1024
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,767
Of course.

1025
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,769
I'm sorry, Katherine.

1026
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,121
For what, Jim?

1027
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,729
Underestimating you.

1028
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,409
And any other woman like you...

1029
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,767
Though I don't imagine
there's many.

1030
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,962
That's good practice,
right there.

1031
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,736
<i>We interrupt
this musical programming</i>

1032

<i>with breaking news.</i>

1033
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,802
<i>The Soviet news agency

<i>that Russian cosmonaut,
Yuri Gagarin,</i>

1035
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,327
<i>has become

1036
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,481
<i>Gagarin completed</i>

1037
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,880

<i>as they become available.</i>

1041
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,007
Guess that puts us
behind the curve.

1042
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,440
The Vostok-1 rocket...

1043
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,808
<i>delivered Russian cosmonaut
Yuri Gagarin's 3KA capsule...</i>

<i>Reentering Russian airspace

1050
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,849
Well, they beat

1051
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,126
Let's go.

1052
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,336
<i>He is also conferred
the title...</i>

1053
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,640
Let's learn how to fly to space.

1054
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,887
<i>"First Soviet Astronaut"...</i>

1055
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,850
<i>and has been proclaimed

1056
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,970

1057
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,884
<i>for the Russian space program</i>

1058
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,281
<i>and a crushing blow for America</i>

1059
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,362
<i>in the race for space.</i>

1060
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,363
I wanna thank everyone
for staying.

1061
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,682
I know it's late.
And after what I just saw,

1062
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,491
I'm sure everyone's probably
anxious to just go home.

1063
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,241
Before we do, I just
have to ask a question.

1064
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,729
The same one

1065
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,656
I've been asking myself
all the way over here...

1066
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,727
which is...

1067
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,090
How the hell did we find ourself

1068
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,089
in second place
in a two-man race?

1069
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,881
Anybody?

1070
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,881
Paul?

1071
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,880
And I think Glenn said it
pretty well.

1072
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,120
They're just outworking us.

1073
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,441
The reason I have to think that

1074
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,696
is because I refuse to believe

1075
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,290
that the Russians
are smarter than us

1076
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,965
or that they have
more technology,

1077
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,565
or that they care more.

1078
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,123
But I don't know.
Is that possible?

1079
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,646
Is it possible that it actually

1080
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,245
means more to them?

1081
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,923
We're in the fight
of our lives, people.

1082
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,401
We're not on some epic joy ride.

1083
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,244
I just saw seven faces

1084
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,403
who aren't sure
that we can get there.

1085
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,729
This is our problem.

1086
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,085
And so as of right now

1087
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,056
there's only two things you
need to know going forward.

1088
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,605
One is staying here,
working late,

1089
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,960
that's gonna be a fact of life.

1090
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,610
And two, don't expect
your paychecks

1091
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,256
to reflect the extra time
it's gonna take

1092
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,248
to catch up
and pass those bastards.

1093
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,736
For those of you
who can't work that way,

1094
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,127
I understand and thank you
for what you've done.

1095
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,770
For everyone else...

1096
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,007
I suggest you call your wives

1097
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,571
and tell them how it's gonna be.

1098
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,490
I'll start with mine.

1099
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,047
Sam, turn it up.
Turn it up.

1100
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,201
Yes, sir.

1101
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,050
John.
Morning, sir.

1102
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,044
7-5, 7-4, 7-3...

1103
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,685
End of the day.

1104
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,886
Okay, we're looking good.

1105
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,041
Okay.

1106
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,171
Sir, might be
the selector latch.

1107
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,520
I'm taking a walk.

1108
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,284
<i>We're honored
to serve our country.</i>

1109
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,681
<i>So we don't think about danger.</i>

1110
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,842
<i>We don't have time to be scared.</i>

1111
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,883
<i>We got a job to do.</i>

1112
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,082
Good morning.
Good morning.

1113
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,368
<i>Mrs. Jackson.</i>

1114
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,727
Colored seats are at the back
of the court room.

1115
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,245
Thank you, ma'am.

1116
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,289
So, which one of you
wants to go first?

1117
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,283
The IBM 7090
data processing system.

1118
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,642
It has the capability of solving

1119
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,804
over 24,000 multiplications

1120
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,121
per second.

1121
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,004
Holy Moses,
that's lightning fast.

1122
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,400
They'll never get that to work.

1123
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,768
Oh, it'll run eventually.

1124
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,968
And when it does, we have
to know how to program it.

1125
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,560
Unless you'd rather be
out of a job.

1126
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,130
No, ma'am.

1127
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,291
Mr. Z...

1128
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,804
I got a court date.

1129
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,171
"The computer uses it

1130
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,850
"as its high speed storage unit,

1131
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,048
"an information
holding device."

1132
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,161
Hmm.

1133
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,166
You have a brain.

1134
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,845
That I can work with.

1135
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,522
This is in the wrong spot.

1136
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,203
Attagirl.

1137
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,481
Ruth.

1138
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,256
Yes, sir. Get me the
Cape on the line.

1139
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,123
Shepard's trajectories
need to be updated.

1140
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,047
Wow.

1141
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,961
Where is she?

1142
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,128
<i>You and I are no
different from each other</i>

1143
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,284
<i>Shut our eyes
when we slumber I see numbers</i>

1144
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,083
<i>Black and white
we're computers, I am color</i>

1145
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,400
<i>Don't act like
you was there when you wasn't</i>

1146
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,011
<i>I don't want no free ride</i>

1147
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,331
<i>Some nights I cry</i>

1148
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,448
<i>'Cause I can see the day comin'</i>

1149
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,602
<i>Together we fly</i>

1150
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,006
<i>Oh, but no more runnin'</i>

1151
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,570
<i>No more runnin'</i>

1152
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,720
Where the hell have you been?

1153
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,327
Everywhere I look, you're not
where I need you to be.

1154
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,641
It's not my imagination.

1155
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,928
Now where the hell
do you go every day?

1156
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,404
To the bathroom, sir.

1157
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,766
To the bathroom?

1158
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,561
To the damn bathroom.

1159
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,120
For 40 minutes a day?

1160
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,685
What do you do in there?

1161
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,331
We're T-minus zero here.
I put a lot of faith in you.

1162
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,921
There's no bathroom for me here.

1163
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,496
What do you mean there is
no bathroom for you here?

1164
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,887
There is no bathroom.

1165
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,771
There are no colored
bathrooms in this building

1166
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,888
or any building
outside the West Campus,

1167
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,331
which is half a mile away.

1168
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,521
Did you know that?

1169
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,647
I have to walk to Timbuktu
just to relieve myself.

1170
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,882
And I can't use
one of the handy bikes.

1171
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,963
Picture that, Mr. Harrison.

1172
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,801
My uniform...

1173
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,691
Skirt below my knees, my heels,

1174
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,171
and a simple string of pearls.

1175
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,004
Well, I don't own pearls.

1176
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,969
Lord knows you don't pay
coloreds enough

1177
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,565
to afford pearls!

1178
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,565
And I work like a dog,
day and night,

1179
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,842
living off of coffee from a pot

1180
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,410
none of you wanna touch!

1181
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,731
So, excuse me

1182
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,484
if I have to go to the restroom

1183
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,324
a few times a day.

1184
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,171
There you have it.

1185
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,925
No more colored restrooms.

1186
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,241
No more white restrooms.

1187
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,004
Just plain old toilets.

1188
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,725
Go wherever
you damn well please.

1189
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,930
Preferably closer to your desk.

1190
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,042
Here at NASA, we all
pee the same color.

1191
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,250
Heard you was fighting the flu.

1192
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,129
Figured you could use some soup.

1193
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,725
Hot meal for the girls.

1194
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,529
Come on in.

1195
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,971
Excuse me.

1196
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,566
Okay, ladies.
Let's say grace.

1197
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,125
Bow your heads.

1198
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,571
Dear Lord, thank you
for this meal.

1199
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,768
We ask that you bless this food

1200
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,888
so that it may bless our bodies.

1201
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,008
In Jesus's name we pray.

1202
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,570
Amen.
Amen.

1203
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,924
It's a historic day,
here at Cape Canaveral.

1204
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,411
And here's what we can expect.

1205
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,450
Alan Shepard and Freedom <i>7</i>
will be launched into space

1206
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,285
at an altitude of about
116 miles an hour.

1207
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,328
Dorothy, come on, you gonna miss it!
Oh, boy! Go.

1208
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,656
- Come on, Dorothy.
- I'm coming.

1209
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,489
<i>Then he will land
around 35 miles</i>

1210
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,641
<i>off the coast of Florida...</i>

1211
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,966
<i>where he'll be picked up</i>

1212
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,496
<i>by</i> the men
of the USS Lake Champlain...

1213
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,521
Finally. Come over here.

1214
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,563
<i>Who set out
for this historic purpose.</i>

1215
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,616
Freedom 7,
we're <i>going</i> to have to bleed off

1216
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,371
<i>some of the pressure
inside the liquid oxygen tank.</i>

1217
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,523
<i>That should reduce the temperature
inside the capsule. Over.</i>

1218
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,250
Any day now, CAPCOM.

1219
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,240
<i>Fix your little problem
and light this candle.</i>

1220
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,971
<i>Roger that, Freedom 7.</i>

1221
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,531
<i>Stand by.</i>

1222
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,896
<i>Temperature is returning
to normal.</i>

1223
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,888
<i>Running one more
launch status check.</i>

1224
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,121
<i>All systems now go.</i>

1225
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,810
Move to final countdown
sequence.

1226
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,485
Moving to final
countdown sequence.

1227
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,561
<i>Roger</i> that.

1228
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,811
We're at T-minus 10...

1229
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,561
nine...

1230
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,846
eight...

1231
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,326
<i>seven...</i>

1232
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,686

<i>zero.</i>

1239
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,360
<i>We have ignition.</i>

1240
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,326
<i>And we have lift off.</i>

1241
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,520
Get up there.

1242
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,921
<i>Lift off,
and the clock is started.</i>

1243
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,644
<i>Fuel is go. 2.5 G.</i>

1244
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,881
Get on up there.

1245
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,246
- Come on!
<i>- Lift</i> off at

1246
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,209
<i>34 minutes after the hour.</i>

1247
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,007
Pitch 88.
Trajectory is good.

1248
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,564
Yaw is okay.

1249
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,529
Switching manual roll.

1250
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,682
Yes!

1251
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,648
For the <i>eyes</i> of <i>the</i> world

1252
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,928
<i>now look into space,</i>

1253
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,401
<i>to the Moon
and to the planets beyond.</i>

1254
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,481
Yes!
We did it!

1255
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,688
<i>And we have vowed...</i>

1256
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,207
<i>that we shall not
see it governed...</i>

1257
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,601
<i>by a hostile flag of conquest...</i>

1258
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,523
<i>but by a banner
of freedom and peace.</i>

1259
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,891
<i>We set sail on this new sea...</i>

1260
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,328
<i>because there is new knowledge
to be gained...</i>

1261
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,369
<i>and new rights to be won.</i>

1262
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,446
<i>We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade</i>

1263
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,210
<i>and do the other things...</i>

1264
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,044
<i>not because they are easy...</i>

1265
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,009
<i>but because they are hard.</i>

1266
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,649
Suppose we should all
thank President Kennedy

1267
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,689
for the continued job security.

1268
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,165
Uh, Gus Grissom's up next.

1269
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,841
Another suborbital flight
with a Redstone.

1270
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,761
It's our last shot

1271
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,251
before we strap Glenn
to the Atlas

1272
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,850
and pray we can bring him
back down.

1273
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,530
Yes, and I imagine he'd like us

1274
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,364
to have the math
worked out beforehand.

1275
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,964
Good work, gentlemen.

1276
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,248
Go have dinner with your kids

1277
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,970
and let's get back to work.

1278
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,125
<i>Look what you've done to me</i>

1279
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,043
<i>Make me behave like
I wouldn't ever</i>

1280
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,402
<i>I know you're the one for me</i>

1281
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,126
<i>Your essence is the ink
in the word "forever"</i>

1282
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,080
I think it's high time that
I kissed you, Katherine.

1283
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,446
Oh, and why is that?

1284
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,564
Figured you attracted to me,
same as I to you.

1285
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,843
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

1286
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,120
Or you would have told me to
get going a long time ago.

1287
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,126
Haven't kissed a man
in a long time.

1288
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,611
Almost forgot how to.

1289
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,560
<i>The FBI
has arrested four white men</i>

1290

<i>accused of throwing a fire bomb</i>

01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,441
<i>AH of us realized
the bus was on fire...</i>

1297
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,682
<i>and had to go out into the mob.</i>

1298
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,056
The kids don't need
to be watching this.

1299
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,411
They need to see this.

1300
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,120
<i>When we got off the bus
in Birmingham...</i>

1301
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,645
Everybody needs to see this.

1302
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,564
<i>Took me and forced me
out of the door...</i>

1303
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,881
<i>and threw me into the crowd.</i>

1304
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,646
<i>And then I was beaten by one
big guy and several others.</i>

1305
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,963
<i>We think we're rendering
a great service to our nation.</i>

1306
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,845
<i>For this is not a struggle
for ourselves alone.</i>

1307
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,884
<i>It is a struggle
to save the soul of America.</i>

1308
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,166
Mary Jackson.

1309
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,849
Petition to attend courses
at Hampton High School.

1310
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,691
Good morning, Your Honor.

1311
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,886
Hampton High School is
a white school, Mrs. Jackson.

1312
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,282
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm aware of that.

1313
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,164
Virginia,
still a segregated state.

1314
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,249
Regardless of what
the federal government says,

1315
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,602
regardless of what
the Supreme Court says,

1316
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,569
our law is the law.

1317
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,567
Your Honor, if I may.

1318
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,404
I believe there are
special circumstances

1319
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,481
to be considered.

1320
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,290
What would warrant
a colored woman

1321
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,361
attending a white school?

1322
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,044
May I approach your bench, sir?

1323
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,161
Your Honor...

1324
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,409
you of all people
should understand

1325
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,965
the importance of being first.

1326
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,410
How's that, Mrs. Jackson?

1327
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,202
You were the first
in your family

1328
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,169
to serve in the Armed Forces.

1329
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,521
U.S. Navy.

1330
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,001
The first to attend university.

1331
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,690
George Mason.

1332
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,047
And the first state judge
to be recommissioned

1333
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,561
by three consecutive governors.

1334
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,404
You've done some research.

1335
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,171
Yes, sir.

1336
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,931
What's the point?

1337
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,411
The point is, Your Honor...

1338
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,767
no Negro woman
in the state of Virginia...

1339
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,281
has ever attended
an all-white high school.

1340
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,441
It's unheard of.

1341
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,204
Yeah. Unheard of.

1342
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,571
And before Alan Shepard
sat on top of a rocket,

1343
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,842
no other American
had ever touched space.

1344
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,328
And now, he will forever
be remembered

1345
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,921
as the U.S. Navy man
from New Hampshire,

1346
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,128
the first to touch the stars.

1347
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,001
And I, sir...

1348
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,686
I plan on being
an engineer at NASA,

1349
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,763
but I can't do that
without taking them classes

1350
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,604
at that all-white high school.

1351
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,091
And I can't change
the color of my skin.

1352
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,407
Sol have no choice
but to be the first.

1353
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,163
Which I can't do
without you, sir.

1354
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
Your Honor...

1355
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,966
out of all the cases
you're gonna hear today...

1356
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,646
which one is gonna matter
100 years from now?

1357
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,245
Which one is gonna
make you the first?

1358
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,201
Hmm.

1359
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,084
Only the night classes...

1360
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,525
Mrs. Jackson.

1361
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,086
Yes. yes, yes!

1362
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,321
Yes!

1363
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,080
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe.

1364
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,656
How late did he say
he was gonna be?

1365
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,576
Excuse me. No
more than five minutes, sir.

1366
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,090
Gus Grissom's coordinates.

1367
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,204
Uh, I'd like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1368
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,200
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

1369
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,449
An orbital launch with an Atlas
rocket is going to take time.

1370
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,404
Is there a problem?

1371
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,926
Mr. Harrison...

1372
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,330
I was wondering.

1373
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,289
Uh-huh. I've been
wondering my whole life,

1374
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,010
so you just spit it out.

1375
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,083
Well, sir...

1376
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,562
I would like to get a jump
on John Glenn's trajectory.

1377
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,776
This isn't about
plugging in numbers,

1378
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,006
it's about inventing the math.

1379
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,856
And I think you and I
talked about that, right?

1380
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,881
It doesn't exist.

1381
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,041
I can do it, sir.

1382
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,645
Do you have any idea
how exacting

1383
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,245
these calculations have to be?

1384
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,841
It's like shooting a sawed-off
shotgun from a thousand feet

1385
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,696
and getting that one BB through a
hole so tiny, you can't even see it.

1386
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,736
Okay, let me see
what you've got.

1387
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,841
I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1388
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,488
How have the
Grissom numbers been?

1389
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,570
They've been spot on.

1390
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,480
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1391
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,696
But you run it all through
Stafford, you understand?

1392
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,721
Yes, sir.

1393
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,361
Thank you.

1394
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,289
Computers don't author reports.

1395
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,686
CAPCOM, <i>this is</i> Liberty Bell 7.

1396
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,761
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

1397
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,849
<i>Okay, it's a nice
ride up to now.</i>

1398
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,001
Roger.

1399
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,728
<i>Liberty</i> Bell <i>7,
this is Hook</i> 1 <i>approaching.</i>

1400
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,801
<i>Ready to hook on. Over.</i>

1401
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,201
<i>I read you loud
and clear. Over.</i>

1402
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,360
<i>The hatch is blown, CAPCOM.</i>

1403
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,609
<i>The Liberty Bell 7
capsule is taking on water.</i>

1404
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,683
<i>Gus Grissom
is out of the capsule.</i>

1405
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,366
<i>Rescuers are now going
to pull him</i>

1406
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,441
<i>from the ocean waves.</i>

1407
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,685
<i>Unfortunately, the Liberty</i>
Bell 7 <i>capsule is lost.</i>

1408
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,881
Mama.

1409
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,801
I can't, I can't.
Mary.

1410
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,136
Mr. Harrison,

1411
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,480
<i>taxpayer money
sank into the ocean</i>

1412
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,806
<i>along with your capsule.</i>

1413
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,961
<i>So what makes you think</i>

1414
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,849
<i>you can bring
John Glenn home safely?</i>

1415
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,001
<i>Let me say first...</i>

1416
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,480
<i>discovery is never
just for the sake</i>

1417
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,560
<i>of discovery, gentlemen...</i>

1418
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,762
<i>but for the sake
of human survival.</i>

1419
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,647
<i>And it will always
come with a risk.</i>

1420
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,322
<i>Whoever gets there first
will make the rules.</i>

1421
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,482
<i>That's been true
of every civilization.</i>

1422
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,651
<i>And so, I think
the bigger question</i>

1423
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,250
<i>for this body to consider is...</i>

1424
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,007
<i>who do you want calling
the shots in space?</i>

1425
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,643
<i>We have to know
what's out there, Senator.</i>

1426
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,891
<i>We have to touch the stars,</i>

1427
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,281
<i>if only to ensure
our own survival.</i>

1428
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,283
<i>And only a man can do that.</i>

1429
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,571
<i>We'll get John Glenn home safely</i>

1430
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,130
<i>because we have to.</i>

1431
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,327
<i>Because he has to tell us
what he saw.</i>

1432
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,882
The Redstone rocket
went straight up.

1433
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,324
But the capsule
didn't have enough speed

1434
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,920
to go into orbit,
so it came back down.

1435
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,122
Essentially a triangle.
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1436
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,884
That math was known.

1437
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,560
That took Shepard, took Grissom.

1438
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,925
That cannot take Glenn.

1439
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,484
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1440
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,089
that can push us into orbit.

1441
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,369
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1442
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,969
Earth's gravity
keeps pulling at it

1443
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,771
but it's going so fast,
it keeps missing the Earth.

1444
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,684
That's how it stays in orbit.

1445
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,127
Now, getting it back down...

1446
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,564
that's the math we don't know.

1447
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,641
Yes, Katherine.

1448
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,485
So the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever

1449
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,563
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1450
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,281
That's right.

1451
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,410
Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1452
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,164
at precisely the right amount,

1453
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,321
that's the task.

1454
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,481
Yes, Katherine.

1455
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,087
So it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit...

1456
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,682
to a parabolic orbit.

1457
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,881
Yes.

1458
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,722
That's the "Go/No-go."

1459
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,848
Now at this point,
it's a pin head.

1460
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,005
We bring him in too soon...

1461
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,810
He burns up on reentry.

1462
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,200
That's right.

1463
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,691
We bring him in too late...

1464
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,444
he's pushed
out of Earth's gravity.

1465
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,922
And any changes to mass,
weight, speed, time...

1466
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,448
distance, friction,
or a puff of wind...

1467
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,408
would alter the "Go/No-go."

1468
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,530
And we start
our calculations over.

1469
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,921
Yes.

1470
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,447
So we need to be able to
choose this reentry point.

1471
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,604
Now this "Go/No-go,"
this has to be exact.

1472
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,807
Sam.

1473
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,568
These are the latest
Redstone numbers

1474
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,971
in current capsule data.

1475
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,690
Obviously, we know
the launch spot.

1476
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,761
Thanks.

1477
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,604
A Pentagon briefing
should illuminate

1478
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,409
where the Navy
needs the recovery zone.

1479
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,443
Then we work backwards
from there.

1480
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,727
And the rest is on us,
so let's get to work.

1481
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,441
Uh, Mr. Stafford.

1482
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
What, Katherine?

1483
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,165
If I could attend the briefings,

1484
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,402
I'd be more useful
to the project.

1485
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,403
Pentagon briefings
are closed door.

1486
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,404
Yes, but if we don't
have the information

1487
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,811
of the changes...

1488
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,961
we can't keep up.

1489
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,456
I need those changes
as they occur.

1490
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,640
As you said, it's a pin head.

1491
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,524
Katherine, that's the job.

1492
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,250
You asked for this assignment,

1493
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,402
so just calculate
with what you have.

1494
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,528
Or we'll find someone who can.

1495
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,287
Okay.

1496
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,929
Attagirl.

1497
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,602
What the hell are you doing?
You can't be in here.

1498
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,807
Who are you?

1499
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,883
I'm with
the West Computing Group.

1500
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,360
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1501
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,249
This is a very delicate
piece of equipment.

1502
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,176
I'm sorry, sir. I'm just
trying to be helpful.

1503
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,441
Uh-huh.
Bill, we've got numbers.

1504
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,530
What kind of numbers?

1505
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,005
Well, I'll be.

1506
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,161
What's your name again?

1507
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,286
Dorothy Vaughan.

1508
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,925
Dorothy Vaughan.

1509
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,646
<i>Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.</i>

1510
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,405
Oh, this is all moot.

1511
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,403
We're altering the
window on the capsule.

1512
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,050
When did this happen?
Six minutes ago.

1513
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,651
The math is changing.
Start over.

1514
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,088
Sir, if I could attend the
briefings, I could stay current...

1515
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,730
Katherine, we have
been through this.

1516
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,881
It is not possible.

1517
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,616
There is no protocol
for women attending.

1518
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,801
There's no protocol for a man

1519
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,160
circling the Earth either, sir.

1520
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,851
Okay. That is just
the way things are.

1521
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,605
Colonel Glenn's
launch coordinates,

1522
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,160
accounting for
the window change, sir.

1523
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,520
I have told you this.

1524
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,120
Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

1525
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,368
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1526
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,443
That is not the way this works.

1527
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,967
Paul. What's
happening here?

1528
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,282
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

1529
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,521
And why is that?

1530
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,371
Sir, the data changes so fast.
The capsule changes.

1531
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,971
The weight and the landing zones

1532
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,565
are all changing, every day.

1533
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,961
I do my work, you attend
these briefings,

1534
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,041
I have to start over.

1535
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,523
Colonel Glenn launches
in a few weeks.

1536
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,600
We don't have the math
figured out yet.

1537
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,090
Why is it she can't attend?

1538
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,456
Because she doesn't
have clearance, Al.

1539
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,925
I cannot do my work effectively

1540
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,400
if I do not have all of the data

1541
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,647
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1542
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,456
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1543
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,164
Pentagon briefings
are not for civilians.

1544
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,416
It requires
the highest clearance.

1545
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,456
I feel like I'm the best person

1546
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,640
to present my calculations...

1547
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,736
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
No, I am not.

1548
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,728
And she is a woman.
There is no protocol

1549
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,936
for a woman
attending these meetings.

1550
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,291
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1551
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,845
But within these walls,

1552
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,330
who makes the rules?

1553
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,005
You, sir. You are the boss.

1554
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,811
You just have
to act like one. Sir.

1555
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,321
You keep quiet.

1556
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,281
Thank you.

1557
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,281
Good morning.

1558
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,440
Gentlemen.

1559
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,441
This is Katherine Goble

1560
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,887
with our Trajectory
and Launch Window division.

1561
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,207
Her work is pertinent
to today's proceedings.

1562
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,441
Come on.

1563
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,886
Wanna get her a chair?

1564
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,856
We have a
confirmed launch window...

1565
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,200
Get her a chair, please.
Yes, sir.

1566
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,336
We have a
confirmed launch window

1567
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,486
<i>for Friendship 7.</i>

1568
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,801
Let's discuss a landing zone.

1569
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,681
The Navy needs
a singular landing zone.

1570
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,127
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval.

1571
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,321
Outside of that

1572
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,209
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1573
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,647
We'd like three possible
recovery areas.

1574
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,160
We can't cover
half the damn ocean.

1575
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,966
With all due respect,

1576
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,809
our capsule's being
altered daily.

1577
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,007
We're orbiting the Earth
at what speed now?

1578
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,001
Uh...

1579
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,766
17,544 miles per hour...

1580
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,763
at the time the rocket
delivers the capsule

1581
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,086
into low space orbit.

1582
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,360
Well, that's one hell
of a speeding ticket.

1583
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,880
Okay.

1584
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,365
So we have the vehicle's speed,

1585
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,566
the launch window...

1586
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,370
and for argument's sake,
the landing zone

1587
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,726
is the Bahamas.

1588
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,609
Should be enough
to figure the "Go/No-go"?

1589
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,250
Yeah, in theory, sir.

1590
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,004
We need to be past
theory at this point.

1591
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,850
We'll be able to
calculate a "Go/No-go"

1592
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,445
with that information.

1593
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,523
When exactly
is that gonna happen?

1594
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:57,961
Katherine.

1595
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,484
Have a go at it.

1596
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,640
The "Go" point for re-entry
is 2,990 miles

1597
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,651
from where we want
Colonel Glenn to land.

1598
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,081
If we assume
that's the Bahamas...

1599
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,722
at 17,544 miles per hour...

1600
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,480
upon re-entry...

1601
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,004
370 feet...

1602
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,329
at a descent angle...

1603
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,842
of 46.56 degrees.

1604
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,481
Distance...

1605
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,647
velocity squared, sine...

1606
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,007
gravity squared.

1607
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,566
Sine, 32 feet.

1608
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,284
And the distance would be...

1609
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:17,209
20,530,372 feet...

1610
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:23,049
or 2,990 miles...

1611
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,887
or 46.33 degrees.

1612
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,640
Okay, so that puts
your landing zone

1613
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:37,361
at 5.0667 degrees North...

1614
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,524
77.3333 degrees West.

1615
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,524
Which is here.

1616
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,084
Right here.

1617
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,368
Give or take 20 square miles.

1618
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,526
I like her numbers.

1619
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,206
Thank you.

1620
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,844
That, of course, is assuming

1621
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,571
the capsule hits
the re-entry point exactly.

1622
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,208
How do we ensure that?

1623
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,922
That's the math we don't
have yet, gentlemen.

1624
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,845
We're working on it.

1625
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,241
Katherine.

1626
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,376
What's it gonna take to make
this thing worth the price tag?

1627
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,767
We're just getting up
to speed here, Mr. Harrison.

1628
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,927
I need more manpower.

1629
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,889
I need programmers,
folks to feed the cards.

1630
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,530
Get them, for crying out loud.

1631
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,601
Okay.

1632
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,728
You're the IBM man, right?
Yes, sir.

1633
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,723
Go pull them out of the sky
if you have to.

1634
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,576
Let's get ahead of this thing
or I'm not paying you.

1635
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,840
Understood.

1636
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,202
I got that one, I got that one.

1637
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,364
I'm not paying any of you.

1638
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,961
Me?

1639
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,770
Temporarily, yes.

1640
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,048
We need the IBM
for Glenn's launch.

1641
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,160
The lead engineer says
you're good with the cards,

1642
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,531
programming and such.

1643
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,764
What about the girls here?

1644
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,400
Human computers can't
calculate an orbital flight

1645
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,891
in the time we have.

1646
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,485
They'll stay put for now.

1647
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,324
What about after now?

1648
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,560
After Glenn's launch,

1649
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,961
NASA's dissolving
the computing groups.

1650
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,243
I'm not accepting reassignment

1651
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,322
unless I bring my
ladies with me.

1652
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,246
Excuse me?

1653
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,926
We're gonna need a lot of
manpower to program that beast.

1654
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,320
I can't do it alone.

1655
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,643
My gals are ready.
They can do the work.

1656
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,321
Ladies.

1657
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,364
We've been reassigned.

1658
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,921
Leave your calculators.

1659
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,525
You won't need them
where we're going.

1660
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,763
Welcome, ladies.

1661
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,082
You know what your job is, Paul?

1662
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,602
Find the genius
among those geniuses.

1663
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,445
To pull us all up.

1664
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,409
We all get to the peak together

1665
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,009
or we don't get there at all.

1666
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,442
Yes.
Well, good night, sir.

1667
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,042
I don't know what time
I'm coming home.

1668
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,884
Class ends at nine.

1669
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,485
You got something to say?

1670
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,449
I thought you might need these.

1671
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,082
You can refill them with
any weight lead you want.

1672
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,324
You see, you just
hit the top like this.

1673
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,162
All right?
The lead comes out.

1674
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,649
You put the new lead in...

1675
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,684
and new pencil.

1676
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,607
You gonna make a fine engineer.

1677
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,601
You think so?

1678
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,841
Yes.

1679
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,764
And nobody dare stand
in the way...

1680
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:33,366
of Mary Jackson's dreams.

1681
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,925
Myself included.

1682
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,601
Don't make me mad again.

1683
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,000
Yes, ma'am.

1684
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,603
And don't make me late, either.

1685
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,285
You gonna be late.
I'mma make you late.

1686
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,891
You won't be late.

1687
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,521
All right, gentlemen.

1688
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,721
Tonight, we discuss

1689
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,963
Planck-Einstein
wavelength relationships.

1690
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,166
Yes?

1691
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:12,801
I'm Mary Jackson.

1692
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,325
I'm enrolled.

1693
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,642
Well, the curriculum
is not designed

1694
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,881
for teaching a woman.

1695
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,562
I imagine it's the same
as teaching a man.

1696
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,328
I don't see a colored section.

1697
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,244
Should I just take any seat?

1698
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,846
Thank you.

1699
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,484
Okay. Uh...

1700
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,331
Planck-Einstein.

1701
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,200
<i>The problem...</i>

1702
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,449
is when the capsule moves
from an elliptical orbit

1703
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,085
to a parabolic orbit.

1704
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,241
There's no mathematical
formula for that.

1705
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,886
Because we can calculate
launch and landing...

1706
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,405
but without this conversion

1707
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,927
the capsule stays in orbit,
we can't bring it back home.

1708
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,120
Maybe we've been thinking
about this all wrong.

1709
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,561
How's that?

1710
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,730
Maybe it's not new math at all.

1711
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,444
It could be old math.

1712
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,727
Something that looks
at the problem numerically,

1713
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,370
and not theoretically.

1714
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,284
Math is always dependable.

1715
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,646
For you it is.

1716
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,487
Euler's method.

1717
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,801
Yes.

1718
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,042
But that's ancient.
But it works.

1719
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,324
It works numerically.

1720
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,681
That's it.

1721
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,360
Let's type it up.

1722
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,521
Okay.

1723
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,441
Huh.

1724
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,846
Dorothy.

1725
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,051
Mrs. Mitchell.

1726
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,203
You're working late today.

1727
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:02,527
Seems to always happen that way.

1728
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,682
Yes. Seems to.

1729
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,521
Thank you.

1730
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,405
I hear the IBM's
up to full capacity.

1731
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,210
You certainly
have a knack for it.

1732
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,690
My father taught me a thing
or two about mechanics.

1733
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,767
You know, I have a few
girls in the East Group

1734
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,241
that have an interest
in learning more about it.

1735
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,526
It is the future.

1736
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:36,001
I may bring them by,
if it's all the same to you.

1737
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,564
That's not my decision, ma'am.

1738
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,764
That would be the supervisor's.

1739
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,449
Yes, that's true.

1740
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,284
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

1741
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,730
You know, Dorothy.

1742
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,363
Despite what you may think...

1743
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,767
I have nothing against y'all.

1744
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,121
I know.

1745
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,442
I know you
probably believe that.

1746
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,286
Good night, Katherine.

1747
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,486
Good night.

1748
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,449
Mama!
Hey, babies.

1749
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,443
Mama.
Hi.

1750
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,281
<i>HEY-</i>

1751
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,491
Oh, please don't tell me
I missed someone's birthday.

1752
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,641
No, you didn't.

1753
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,881
No, you didn't, Mama.

1754
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,650
Madame, your seat.

1755
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,564
Well, thank you.

1756
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,483
Wait, is it my birthday?

1757
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,801
No, Mama.

1758
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,491
You all look so pretty.

1759
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,847
Mama, what's going on?

1760
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,325
Good evening, Katherine.

1761
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,606
So you're not gonna
say anything?

1762
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,205
It's not my place.

1763
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,240
You, either?

1764
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,088
Okay, I'm not gonna
do this all night.

1765
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,490
Oh, mother of mercy.

1766
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,201
That's for me.

1767
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,648
Are you sad, Mama?
No.

1768
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,041
It's okay, Mama.
He's a good man.

1769
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,964
I know.

1770
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,416
I just can't help it.

1771
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,204
He hasn't even asked you yet.

1772
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,169
I know, but he is.

1773
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,321
You are, right?

1774
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,720
If y'all will let me.

1775
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,008
Well, go on.
She's already crying.

1776
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,525
Oh, hush.

1777
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,720
This was my mother's ring.

1778
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,965
It's beautiful.

1779
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,165
She and my father
were married for...

1780
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,560
For 52 years.

1781
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,562
Figure it's about as lucky
a ring as you can get.

1782
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,482
The day I met you,
I called my mother

1783
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,723
and I said, "Mom, I met the
woman I want to marry."

1784
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,086
What'd she say?

1785
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,776
She said, "She must be
something, Jimmy.

1786
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,801
"Really something."

1787
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,081
Then what'd you say?

1788
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,480
I said, "No.

1789
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,569
"She's more than something.

1790
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,245
"She's everything."

1791
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,081
Now...

1792
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,490
I planned on this being
more romantic.

1793
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,896
I'll make that
up to you real soon.

1794
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,001
It's okay.

1795
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,084
But I know marrying you

1796
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,604
includes marrying
your girls as well.

1797
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,091
Amen to that.

1798
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,761
I do.

1799
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,763
I didn't ask you yet.

1800
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,046
Hurry up.

1801
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,404
Oh, my goodness.

1802
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,241
Oh!

1803
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,127
My babies. Look, girls,
isn't it beautiful?

1804
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,206
Look, Mama.

1805
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,000
The
Mercury-Atlas <i>space</i> vehicle...

1806
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,160
<i>Which will put John Glenn,</i>

1807
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,800
<i>the first American,
into Earth's orbit...</i>

1808
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,043
<i>has already undergone
five unmanned flight tests.</i>

1809
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,201
<i>NASA has confirmed</i>

1810
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,045
<i>that the IBM 790
data processing system...</i>

1811
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,362
<i>has been utilized to confirm
all of the mission's...</i>

1812
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,807
<i>launch and recovery
system calculations.</i>

1813
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,724
<i>The modifications
and equipment installations</i>

1814
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,086
<i>are progressing on schedule.</i>

1815
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,969
Yes, sir. Right in here.

1816
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,680
You wanted to see me, sir?

1817
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,801
Have a seat.

1818
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,604
Is there something wrong,
Mr. Harrison?

1819
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,330
No, there's nothing wrong.

1820
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,889
In fact, our IBM
is churning out numbers

1821
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,122
in fractions of the time
any human can.

1822
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,964
Present company included.

1823
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,130
That's good then.

1824
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,161
Maybe.

1825
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,640
The thing is,
the Cape's now insisting

1826
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,047
on doing all the backups
down there, on site.

1827
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
I see.

1828
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,322
So we won't be
running backups here.

1829
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,325
And truth be told, we can't
keep up with that IBM anyhow.

1830
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,523
Long story short,
we no longer need

1831
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,170
a computer in this department.

1832
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,683
Progress
is a double-edged sword.

1833
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,321
Let's have you report back
to the West Group for now.

1834
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,289
We'll see if we can find
another assignment.

1835
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,325
Thank you, sir.

1836
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,201
Katherine, I'm...

1837
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,964
I'm sorry about this.

1838
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,202
It's out of my hands,
if you can believe that.

1839
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,806
I understand.

1840
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,041
Katherine.

1841
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,884
We heard you got engaged.

1842
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,081
Yes.

1843
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,006
That's thoughtful of you.

1844
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,850
They're lovely.

1845
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,843
Mr. Harrison's idea, really.

1846
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,370
Although I suspect his
wife did the picking out.

1847
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,364
Can't imagine he has an eye
for anything but numbers.

1848
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,250
Now you have a great wedding.

1849
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,763
You did good work
around here, Katherine.

1850
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,096
Hello there.
Good to see you.

1851
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,720
Hi, Reverend. How you doing?
How are you?

1852
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:49,169
I don't think I felt a thing
the first time I did this.

1853
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,810
I was so nervous.

1854
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,016
You're just as beautiful

1855
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,201
as you were back then.

1856
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,004
- You think so?
- Mmm.

1857
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,130
Just a little older.

1858
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,562
And a little fuller.

1859
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,971
But you look good.

1860
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,243
Well, here we go. Again.

1861
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:10,776
<i>Project Mercury...</i>

1862
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,165
<i>named after the winged messenger</i>

1863
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,686
<i>of the gods in
Roman mythology. Today,</i>

1864
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,331
<i>three years, two months,
and three days afterwards...</i>

1865
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,456
<i>we're ready,
after 10 scheduled attempts...</i>

1866
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,970
Attagirl.

1867
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,009
<i>To try again to put
our first man into orbit...</i>

1868
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,810
<i>to put Colonel John Glenn
into orbit.</i>

1869
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,440
Colonel John Glenn will be the
first American to orbit the Earth.

1870
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,041
<i>As you can see, there are</i>

1871
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,360
<i>thousands of people here today</i>

1872
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,323
<i>to witness this historic event.</i>

1873
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,845
Paul, something's off here.

1874
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,162
These landing coordinates
don't match yesterday's.

1875
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,850
The IBM just ran them.

1876
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,802
Well, then the IBM
was wrong yesterday.

1877
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,527
Right?

1878
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:47,850
Or the damn thing's wrong today.

1879
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,802
Paul, am I right?

1880
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,210
It appears so.

1881
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,011
<i>The IBM's been spot-on
up to this point, John.</i>

1882
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,208
<i>But we'll run it again,
see what it comes up with.</i>

1883
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,089
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you, Al.

1884
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,208
When I fly, I fly the machine.

1885
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,727
<i>And right now it seems like
this machine is flying me.</i>

1886
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,040
We're on the same page, John.

1887
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,366
<i>Our guys are on it.</i>

1888
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,324
Let's get the girl
to check the numbers.

1889
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:16,844
<i>- The</i> girl?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1890
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:19,841
You mean Katherine?

1891
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,002
Yes, sir. The smart one.

1892
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,561
I mean, she says they're good,
I'm ready to go.

1893
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,881
All right. We'll get into it.

1894
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,280
<i>Roger.</i>

1895
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,361
Sam.

1896
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,730
Go find Katherine Goble.

1897
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,087
She needs to verify
Glenn's "Go/No-go,"

1898
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,480
or we're staying on the ground.

1899
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,721
Yes, sir.

1900
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,130
I'm looking for Katherine Goble.

1901
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,481
It's Katherine Johnson now.

1902
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:07,280
They need you to verify
these coordinates.

1903
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,971
And <i>tourists have poured
into Cocoa Beach for weeks.</i>

1904
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,168
<i>Took this whole area
surrounding Cape Canaveral</i>

1905
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,770
<i>and Florida, really.</i>

1906
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,161
<i>And all around the country,
it's as if time...</i>

1907
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,402
All right, give her
some space. Let her work.

1908
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,246
As <i>we await
Colonel John Glenn's launch.</i>

1909
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,323
<i>A truly historic day
for America.</i>

1910
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,290
<i>The country has waited
for several months,</i>

1911
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,489
<i>through many failed unmanned
Atlas rocket tests</i>

1912
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,650
<i>and 10 scheduled
manned attempts...</i>

1913
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,882
<i>which were canceled
for various mechanical</i>

1914
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,803
<i>or system complications.</i>

1915
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:39,881
<i>Even the weather...</i>

1916
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,600
<i>All the final tests and checks</i>

1917
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,766
<i>are being conducted.</i>

1918
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,651
John Glenn is ready to board
the <i>Friendship</i> 7.

1919
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,041
<i>But today we remain
truly optimistic,</i>

1920
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:50,521
<i>and it's a "Go" day
in all regards.</i>

1921
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,284
<i>The capsule is ready.</i>

1922
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,169
<i>The rocket itself is A-Okay,</i>

1923
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,129
and the weather here
at Cape Canaveral...

1924
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,487
Anything from Langley?
Not yet.

1925
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,801
<i>We are being told</i>

1926
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,485
<i>that Mission Control at NASA</i>

1927
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,881
<i>is conducting
a final check of the launch</i>

1928
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,161
<i>and recovery coordinates.</i>

1929
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,846
<i>Including the "Go/No-go"
calculations...</i>

1930
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
<i>so crucial</i>

1931
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,804
<i>to a safe and successful
launch and recovery.</i>

1932
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,531
<i>After years of
waiting, and months of delay,</i>

1933
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:16,724
<i>Colonel Glenn is finally ready
for that space flight...</i>

1934
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,008
<i>that we've been waiting for
with so much anticipation.</i>

1935
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,976
<i>These last-minute
checks could indicate</i>

1936
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,889
<i>a hesitancy on NASA's behalf.</i>

1937
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,520
<i>But let us say,
without reservation...</i>

1938
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,209
<i>that the safety
of Colonel John Glenn</i>

1939
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,560
<i>is paramount to the mission...</i>

1940
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,525
<i>and to the nation itself.</i>

1941
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,841
No, sir.
We're still a go.

1942
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,566
Yes, sir.

1943
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:38,321
That's it.

1944
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,120
What the devil are you doing?
Are you taking a break?

1945
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,526
<i>Yes!</i>

1946
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,043
<i>Say yeah</i>

1947
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,367
<i>Yeah</i>

1948
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,730
<i>Say, yeah!</i>

1949
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,561
<i>Yeah</i>

1950
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,242
<i>Don't you know, we never ever</i>

1951
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,247
<i>Never know what makes us major</i>

1952
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,211
<i>Your and my alchemy</i>

1953
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,406

<i>Get behind the other

1961
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,601
<i>It's all very well
that we may never...</i>

1962
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,761
<i>Whoo!</i>

1963
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,931
Do you have the time?

1964
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,327
<i>Yes, we can</i>

1965
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,641
<i>Like a solar system
they're surrounded by you</i>

1966
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,401
<i>Yes, we can</i>

1967
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,087
<i>Pick a number, pick a note

<i>Get behind the other

<i>Whoo!</i>

1975
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:06,481
Sir.

1976
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,127
Pad 14.

1977
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,161
Katherine.

1978
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,441
Come on.

1979
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:36,923
Sir, we've got
Pad 14 on the box.

1980
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,686
All right.
Let me in there.

1981
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,646
This is Langley, we have
the coordinates confirmed.

1982
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,320
Stand by, Langley.

1983
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,761
<i>We can confirm...</i>

1984
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,804
the "Go/No-go" point
for re-entry is...

1985
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:58,330
16.11984 degrees latitude...

1986
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:04,044
-165.2356 degrees longitude.

1987
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,009
The launch window is a go.

1988
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,162
The landing coordinates match.

1989
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:10,964
That is very good news, Al.

1990
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,280
It's a little hard to trust something
you can't look in the eyes.

1991
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,850
That's right, Colonel.

1992
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,729
Katherine did manage
to calculate

1993
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,008
a few decimal points further
than that hunk of metal.

1994
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,649
<i>I will take every digit you got.</i>

1995
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,846
<i>Be sure to thank her for me.</i>

1996
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,204
Gentlemen,
let's launch this rocket.

1997
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,691
<i>Good</i> luck, <i>Friendship 7.</i>

1998
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,330
Godspeed, Langley.

1999
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,051
Here at Cape Canaveral...

2000
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,770
<i>the countdown has resumed...</i>

2001

2003
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,767
<i>high above the

2004
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,528
<i>A height of over 93 feet.</i>

2005
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:45,760
<i>So far, the countdown</i> is...

2006
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,241
<i>These are pictures
from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</i>

2007
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,522
<i>The gantry is now moving back.</i>

2008
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,409
We are go for launch.

2009
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,166
<i>The Mercury
spacecraft umbilical is out.</i>

2010
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,048
<i>T-minus 10 seconds,
and counting.</i>

2011
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,496
<i>Water systems, go.
Mercury capsule, go.</i>

2012
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:00,576
<i>Eight, seven...</i>

2013
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,443
<i>Six, five...
Ready engine. Start.</i>

2014
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:03,696
Four...

01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,882
<i>three, two...
Good Lord, ride all the way.</i>

2016
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,208
One, zero.

2017
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:09,566

2018
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,721
<i>Lift Off.</i>

2019
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,088
<i>The M-A</i> 6 <i>vehicle
has lifted off.</i>

2020
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,560
It's getting
a little bumpy along here.

2021
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,802
Roger that.
You are in Max Q.

2022
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,450
<i>Roger that, CAPCOM.</i>

2023
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,483
<i>AH systems are reported go.</i>

2024
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,130
20 seconds to SECO.

2025
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:32,203
<i>The trajectory
is still A-Okay.</i>

2026
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,447
Go for SECO.

2027
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,091
<i>Roger that, CAPCOM.
Go for SE CO.</i>

2028
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,166
Zero G and I feel fine.

2029
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,126
<i>John Glenn reports
everything looks good.</i>

2030
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,446
Oh, that view is tremendous!

2031
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,968
<i>Roger</i> that, Friendship 7.

2032
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,769

2033
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,410
Thank you, CAPCOM.

2034
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,762
All right.
Ten and a half hours to go.

2035
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,365
If we make seven round trips.

2036
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,131
I could use a coffee.

2037
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,968
<i>Well, as we
approach the end of the day</i>

2038
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,650
<i>here on the Eastern Seaboard...</i>

2039
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,531
<i>Colonel Glenn is just
beginning his third orbit...</i>

2040
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,206
<i>three-quarters of the way

2041
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,964
<i>We see he's currently

2042
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,640
<i>which is the next

2043
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,962
Thankfully,
the Friendship <i>7</i> capsule is...

2044
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,325
New assignment
came down the pike.

2045
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,047
Always changing around here.

2046
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,123
It's hard to keep up.

2047
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,176
Seems like they're going
to need a permanent team

2048
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,043
to feed that IBM.

2049
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,645
How big of a team?

2050
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,723
Thirty, to start.

2051
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,721
Thank you for the information,
Mrs. Mitchell.

2052
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:09,330
You're quite welcome,
Mrs. Vaughan.

2053
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,687
Hmm.

2054
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,725
We have a warning light.

2055
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,368
CAPCOM 7,
I have a warning light.

2056
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,681
Stand by, Seven.

2057
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,243
Sir, we have a warning light.

2058
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,285
What are we looking at, Paul?

2059
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,487
Uh...

2060
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,608
The heat shield
may have come loose.

2061
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,842
Seven, will you confirm
the landing bag

2062
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:13,921
is in the off position?

2063
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,450
Affirmative, CAPCOM.

2064
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:17,931
Al, we need to get him down now.

2065
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,809
He could burn up
on re-entry.

2066
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,603
Come on, babies.

2067
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:31,886
There is a man in space.

2068
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,576
And we don't want to miss it,
so we gotta hurry.

2069
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,284
Something's wrong with Glenn!

2070
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,800
What's going on?
Come on, let's go.

2071
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,087
Come on. Hurry up, now.
Y'all follow me.

2072
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,641
<i>We just learned
that the Friendship</i> 7...

<i>This poses a grave danger

01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,324
It will work.

2087
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,051
It will hold it until he
reaches the "Go/No-go" point.

2088
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,201
It will work.

2089
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,370
Al, he has
to override the .05G.

2090
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,521
Do it.

2091
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,045
<i>Friendship</i> 7...

2092
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,044
we're recommending
that the retro-package not...

2093
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,282
I repeat, not be jettisoned.

2094
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,326
<i>This means that you will have
to override the .05G switch.</i>

2095
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,481
Roger.

2096
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,001
Is there a reason
for this? Over.

2097
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,161
Stand by, Seven.

2098
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,681
Not at this time, Seven.

2099
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,485
Roger that, Command.

2100
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,166
I will make
a manual .05G entry...

2101
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,681
<i>and bring the scope in. Over.</i>

2102
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,526
He knows.

2103
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,840
Without a heat shield...

2104
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,760
<i>there is no way that
Colonel Glenn can get back</i>

2105
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,016
<i>through the Earth's atmosphere.</i>

2106
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,724
<i>The heat is simply
too overpowering.</i>

2107
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,562
<i>A malfunction in the automatic
control system...</i>

2108
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,003
<i>is causing the spacecraft
to yaw in a skid-like fashion.</i>

2109
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,844
<i>Thus putting the Friendship 7's</i>

2110
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,207
<i>re-entry point in jeopardy.</i>

2111
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:24,728
<i>Even now, Colonel Glenn is streaking
toward the United States.</i>

2112
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,360
<i>And he must begin
the retro-sequence</i>

2113
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,283
<i>300 miles west of California...</i>

2114
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,090
<i>if he's to reenter
the atmosphere</i>

2115
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,401
<i>at the designated point...</i>

2116
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,449
<i>and land in the recovery area</i>

2117
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,404
<i>700 miles south
and east of Florida.</i>

2118
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,211
<i>Stay tuned to this station
for further details.</i>

2119
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:42,522
You're going to be
using fly-by-wire

2120
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,601
for re-entry.

2121
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,445
You'll need to maintain
a zero angle, over.

2122
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,728
Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire.

2123
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,922
Back it up with manual. Over.

2124
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,241
Keep talking to him.

2125
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,401
Roger.

2126
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:55,927
The weather,
the recovery area...

2127
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,401
three foot waves,
10 miles visibility.

2128
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,927
CAPCOM, you're going out.

2129
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:02,923
He's crossing the
communication blackout zone.

2130
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,451
There's a real fireball outside.

2131
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:08,880
It's getting
a little hot in here.

2132
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,571
<i>CAPCOM, do you copy?</i>

2133
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:55,120
<i>Friendship 7,
do you copy'? Over.</i>

2134
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,321
Again.

2135
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,482
<i>Friendship 7,
do you copy'? Over.</i>

2136
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,202
<i>Friendship 7,
do you copy'? Over.</i>

2137
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,761
Loud and clear, CAPCOM.

2138
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,127
Roger that.
How are you doing?

2139
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,411
My condition is good.
That was a real fireball. Boy!

2140
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:42,561
Roger that.

2141
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,045
Let's get you all the way home.

2142
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,360
<i>Roger that.</i>

2143
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,641
Here's hoping these landing
coordinates still hold.

2144
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:52,203
Approaching 16.11984.

2145
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,281
Roger.

2146
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:57,365
Approaching
minus 165.2356...

2147
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,490
in three, two, one.

2148
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:02,170
Engaging chutes.

2149
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:05,211
Beautiful chute!

2150
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,326
How are we looking, CAPCOM?

2151
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,363
<i>Your “Go/No-go" is good.</i>

2152
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:11,688
Landing coordinates
are spot on, 7.

2153
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,441
<i>Roger that, CAPCOM.</i>

2154
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:18,045
I've always wanted to swim
in the Bahamas. Over.

2155
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,082
<i>John Glenn has splashed down
and he is being recovered.</i>

2156
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:26,287
Thank you!

2157
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,686
<i>John Glenn has
splashed down safely...</i>

2158
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:33,286
<i>and is being recovered
by the USS Noe.</i>

2159
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,088
Good job. Great job, guys.

2160
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,241
Katherine.

2161
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:45,361
Nice work.

2162
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,125
You too, Mr. Harrison.

2163
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,606
So, um...

2164
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,804
you think
we can get to the moon?

2165
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,400
We're already there, sir.

2166
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:02,921
Yeah.

2167
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,090
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

2168
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,850
Girls, this is
Mrs. Vaughan...

your supervisor.

2170
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,965
She'll show you how things work.

2171
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:48,847
Come on in.

2172
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:55,205
The IBM 7090 data
processing system...

2173
