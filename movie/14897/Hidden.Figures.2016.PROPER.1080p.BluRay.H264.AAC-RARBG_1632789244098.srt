00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,794
真實事件改編

2
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,132
14，15…

3
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,052
16，質數

4
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,429
18，質數

5
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:54,263
「1926年  維吉尼亞州  白硫磺泉鎮」

6
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,264
20

7
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,600
21

8
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,478
22，質數    -西維吉尼亞高中學院

9
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,272
是本州黑人能唸的最好的學校

10
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,817
附近只有那裡有八年級以上的課程

11
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:08,944
等腰三角形

12
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:10,988
不等邊三角形

13
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,782
正三角形

14
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,825
菱形

15
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,786
梯形

16
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,913
凱薩琳現在才六年級

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,997
他們希望她跳級入學

18
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,832
四面體

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,668
十二面體

20
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,337
他們會提供全額獎學金

21
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,005
你們只要人去就好

22
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:30,966
柯曼小姐

23
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,845
你在黑板上寫算式，好嗎？

24
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,772
我們向教職員發起募款

25
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:45,856
雖然金額不大

26
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,192
但足夠讓你們安頓下來

27
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,654
桑納女士，你們真好心

28
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,501
如果兩個數的乘積是零

29
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,961
依照常識判斷

30
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,214
兩個數中至少有一個是零

31
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,342
如果把所有數移到同一邊

32
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,846
這個二次方程式因式分解后

33
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,682
方程式的那一邊會等於零

34
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,018
這樣一來就很簡單明瞭了

35
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,815
我教書這麼多年

36
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,527
從沒看過你女兒這麼聰明的孩子

37
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,362
凱薩琳

38
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,239
快跟上來，親愛的

39
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,408
你們必須去

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,827
讓媽媽抱你上車

41
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,711
你們必須看到她未來的成就

42
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,771
「1961年  維吉尼亞州  漢普頓」

43
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,447
好，發動看看

44
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,074
凱薩琳？

45
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,868
瑪莉

46
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,119
有人嗎？

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,454
凱薩琳

48
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,040
不要再發呆了，快發動車子

49
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,416
知道了

50
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,294
我又不是聾子

51
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,378
很難說

52
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:33,923
我要發動了

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,886
發動機壞了

54
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,931
一定是啟動器的問題

55
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,891
這個啟動器會害我們遲到

56
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,392
我們每天開這輛破車去上班

57
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,978
最後一定會丟了工作

58
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,939
你要走25公里的路也行

59
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,066
或是坐在巴士後排

60
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,902
這兩種方法我都不要

61
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,820
我會搭便車

62
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,493
姊妹們

63
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,667
車子拋錨又不犯法

64
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,127
身為黑人也不犯法

65
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,462
別說了，瑪莉

66
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,507
沒人想因為你說的話而坐牢

67
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:17,925
我儘量，蜜糖

68
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:28,185
「州警局」

69
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,357
這裡不是拋錨的好地方

70
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,527
我們也沒得選，警官

71
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,195
你在頂嘴嗎？

72
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,780
不，長官

73
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,532
你們有證件嗎？

74
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,200
有的，長官    -有，長官

75
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,204
我們正要去上班

76
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,497
在朗里

77
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,958
太空總署，長官

78
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,668
我們的工作是大量的計算

79
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,545
讓火箭飛入太空

80
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,213
你們三個都是    -對，長官

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,339
是的，長官

82
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,800
太空總署

83
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,218
很了不起嘛

84
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,555
我不知道他們還僱用…

85
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:08,309
太空計劃的成員有不少是女性

86
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,028
該死的俄國佬正在監視我們

87
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:20,821
那些史普尼克衛星

88
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,158
你們見過太空人嗎？

89
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,743
水星計劃的七人？

90
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,328
當然

91
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,832
見過，長官，我們是同事

92
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,251
他們是國家的希望

93
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,252
是的    -沒錯

94
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,379
我們要比共產黨先把人送上太空

95
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,255
對    -一定要

96
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,757
整個國家都靠他們了

97
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,008
絕對如此

98
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,677
但我們在路邊拋錨就幫不上忙了

99
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,430
是啊

100
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,265
你們需要拖車還是什麼嗎？

101
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,059
謝謝你，警官，我想我能處理

102
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,268
把那個給我

103
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,772
我只要繞過啟動器就好

104
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,109
她很行的

105
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,904
好女孩

106
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,947
我們弄好了

107
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,533
至少我能幫你們開路

108
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,285
我想你們應該遲到了

109
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,120
不，長官，我們不想麻煩你

110
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,538
那太好了，警官

111
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,124
非常謝謝你，長官

112
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,125
跟著我吧

113
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,126
我來開

114
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,961
桃樂斯快點，以免他改變主意

115
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,922
我們來了    -等一下

116
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,097
贊    -瑪莉，開慢點

117
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,808
慢點，你太近了    -別吵，他說跟著他

118
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,142
他沒說貼著他

119
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,398
老天，這到底是怎麼回事

120
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,982
我告訴你是怎麼回事

121
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,777
三個黑人女性追著白人警官的車

122
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,654
開在維吉尼亞州漢普頓的公路上

123
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,656
時間是1961年

124
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:49,660
各位女士，這是神註定的奇蹟

125
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,747
明天我要搭巴士

126
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,291
瑪莉

127
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,021
升空順利，軌道穩定

128
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,274
給我看

129
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,651
不，要詳細的

130
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,028
北緯40.349110度

131
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,453
上升角度46.56度

132
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,664
時速接近11,909公里

133
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,625
118秒

134
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,213
推進器分離

135
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,720
第二階段成功

136
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,224
史普尼克4號進入軌道

137
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,562
確認進入軌道

138
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,523
確認俄國進入軌道

139
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,901
我是吉姆韋伯

140
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,695
是，總統先生

141
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,989
我們絕對是，先生

142
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,368
他們成功進入一個軌道，可能兩個

143
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,248
小狗查努卡準備再次上太空

144
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,920
我們英勇的太空旅行同志伊凡也是

145
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,672
我們已經證明生命能在太空中維持

146
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,925
也將是最早送人類上太空的國家

147
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,094
一隻該死的狗和該死的假人

148
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:38,352
然後160萬噸的RDS-37熱核彈頭

149
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,271
就會直接丟在艾荷華州首府中央

150
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,856
這個結論跳得太快了，長官

151
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:43,690
什麼？

152
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,235
因為…    -他是哪根蔥？

153
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,445
他是主任工程師保羅史塔佛，長官

154
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,780
我想他的意思是…

155
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,282
您剛剛的推測，至少就我們的計算

156
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,451
在定義上而言…

157
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,203
是有一點點危險的

158
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,454
危險？

159
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,082
你懂什麼是危險嗎，史塔佛先生？

160
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,292
無所作為和猶豫不決

161
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,129
俄國佬有間諜衛星繞著地球轉

162
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,423
誰知道他們偷拍了什麼照片

163
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,885
總統要求我們立刻做出迴應

164
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,721
不能再拖了，不管是誰都沒差

165
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,973
把人弄上去就對了，哈里遜

166
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,308
要是太空計劃再沒有進展

167
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,811
我們就站不住腳了

168
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,606
剛剛感覺怎麼樣，保羅？

169
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,775
你覺得自己有讓長官瞭解了嗎？

170
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,654
不，我覺得他不瞭解

171
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,115
你覺得他了解了嗎，山姆？

172
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,324
沒有那種感覺

173
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,077
我告訴你，他剛剛說的沒錯

174
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,662
你也知道吧？

175
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,748
既然能上去了，下一步就是炸彈了

176
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,793
我們所有的好點子都是這樣

177
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,170
我想他們也不例外…東西呢？

178
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,839
機器呢？

179
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,007
隨時會到，哈里遜先生

180
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,259
隨時會到    -是，長官

181
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,803
那間公司叫什麼名字？

182
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,179
縮寫是IBM

183
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,848
國際商業機器公司

184
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,975
太空是一種商業活動

185
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,686
我需要數學家

186
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:03,979
我會另外提出要求，長官

187
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,355
又是要求，我的老天

188
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,691
整棟樓里沒有一個人…

189
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,152
能處理解析幾何嗎？

190
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,320
據我所知沒有

191
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,487
說點好訊息吧，茹絲

192
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,031
像是俄國人在月球插旗前

193
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,700
我們會找到這個人

194
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:27,878
真的很開心

195
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,505
葛洛莉雅，你去四號樓的工程組

196
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,716
「有色人種計算組」

197
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,009
各位女士

198
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,719
你要是遲到就分不到案子

199
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,888
你分不到案子就沒有工作

200
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,140
伊蓮娜

201
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,059
資料簡化，202大樓

202
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,310
資料簡化？

203
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,730
你想去和磁性電漿動力學作伴也行

204
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,065
不了，女士

205
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,567
謝謝，資料簡化很好

206
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,696
瑪莉    -我在

207
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,240
水星計劃的原型要開始測試了

208
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,409
茲林斯基先生要你…

209
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,411
長期負責這項任務

210
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,829
你說真的嗎？

211
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:03,997
動作快

212
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,251
感謝耶穌

213
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,503
感謝耶穌

214
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,089
瑪莉，你不用說出來

215
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,591
對喔，抱歉，桃樂斯

216
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,387
好了，蕾特女士

217
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,597
你也要支援東側計算組

218
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,433
米契爾女士

219
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
今天早上的動作要特別快，女孩們

220
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,063
這些東西午餐前要算出來

221
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,441
太空任務團隊需要計算人員，儘快

222
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,194
要能處理解析幾何的人

223
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,239
東側計算組找不到人

224
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,573
長期還是臨時？

225
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,034
一切都是臨時，桃樂斯

226
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,285
你有人能用？

227
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,620
我有，女士

228
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,747
凱薩琳是適合人選

229
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,083
她能處理任何數字運算

230
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,584
我會查一下她的資格

231
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,089
沒想到我居然會來這地方

232
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,966
這邊，把那些東西送出去

233
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,134
是，女士

234
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,640
米契爾女士

235
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,808
打擾一下…

236
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,770
我的主管申請，女士

237
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,065
他們是否還考慮讓我擔任主管職？

238
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,316
對

239
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,569
官方說法是沒有

240
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,780
他們不打算為有色人種組安排主管

241
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,907
我能問為什麼嗎？

242
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,576
我不知道為什麼

243
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,244
我沒有問為什麼

244
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,954
我們需要主管，女士

245
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,123
珍森小姐生病以後就沒有主管了

246
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,624
都快要一年了

247
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,418
目前運作也沒什麼問題啊

248
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,337
因為我在做主管的工作

249
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,757
太空總署就是這麼回事

250
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,177
做火箭急得很，陞官慢得很

251
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,096
把那些軌道計算弄好吧

252
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,848
紅石測試需要那些數字

253
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,717
一馬赫風洞測試，發射前一分鐘

254
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,398
你的命比鞋子重要吧

255
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,733
等一下

256
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,736
發射前倒數，10、9

257
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,238
8

258
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,197
7

259
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,200
6、5、4

260
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,894
關掉

261
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,946
如果把外殼從平滑改成波浪狀

262
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,699
座艙可能會更穩定

263
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,119
但是重回大氣層時會增加摩擦力

264
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,455
大部分的擋板腐蝕…

265
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,584
都在後端，后推進器附近的地方

266
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,752
結論呢？

267
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,717
最靠近推進器的地方最接近熱源

268
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,803
加上重返大氣層時溫度會升高

269
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,597
接觸面會變軟

270
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,268
我們可以考慮螺栓以外的固定方式

271
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,479
對

272
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,815
對

273
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,449
工程訓練計劃還有一個名額

274
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,785
平頭鉚釘可以減少風阻力

275
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:15,290
有工程師頭腦的人應該做工程師

276
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,250
你不能一輩子都在做計算

277
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,585
茲林斯基先生…

278
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,921
我是黑人女性

279
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,923
我不會癡人說夢

280
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,175
我是父母死於納粹集中營的

281
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,635
波蘭裔猶太人

282
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,846
現在我頭頂上這艘太空船

283
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,974
將會載著太空人飛向星空

284
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,603
我想可以說我們正在活出不可能

285
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,105
我問你，如果

286
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,317
你是白人男性，會想當工程師嗎？

287
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,863
我不用想，因為我會已經是了

288
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,282
裙子長度必須過膝

289
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,618
穿毛衣比寬鬆上衣好

290
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,038
除了簡單的珍珠項鍊外不能戴首飾

291
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,958
你的主管是艾爾哈里遜先生

292
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,293
他是太空任務團隊的主持人

293
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,713
你要寫研究報告，檢查計算結果等

294
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,675
只有哈里遜先生問你時你才能說話

295
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,970
大部分計算人員都撐不了幾天

296
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,138
這幾個月他已經趕走十幾個了

297
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,140
快跟上

298
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,142
這裡步調很快

299
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,310
「太空任務團隊」

300
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,812
你的通行證

301
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,732
這裡從來沒有黑人，凱薩琳

302
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,067
不要讓我丟臉

303
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,594
這個昨天沒有清

304
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,430
抱歉，我不是…

305
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,682
工友

306
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,365
抱歉，女士

307
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,576
我是哈里遜先生的計算人員

308
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,412
去後面的桌子，我等等就交辦工作

309
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,960
別期望哈里遜先生熱烈歡迎你

310
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,378
做好你的工作，別引人注意

311
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,047
謝謝你

312
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,424
快去把東西放好

313
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:41,811
保羅

314
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,482
為什麼防熱罩的擋板還是會掉？

315
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,984
我們正在設計座艙原型，艾爾

316
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,819
艙蓋尺寸是三分之一…

317
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:50,987
我知道

318
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,616
那個價值百萬的風扇該怎麼辦？

319
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,993
關掉嗎？    -不，艾爾，我不…

320
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,578
我是開玩笑的

321
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,831
保羅，如果防熱擋板掉了

322
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,583
你想我們的太空人會怎麼樣？

323
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,751
我知道

324
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,921
所以我們得想辦法解決，對吧？

325
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,130
是的，我們正在努力

326
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,591
茹絲，計算人員的事怎麼樣了？

327
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,760
她就在你後面，哈里遜先生

328
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,267
她能處理解析幾何嗎？

329
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,312
絕對可以，而且她會說話

330
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,688
是，先生，我會

331
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,483
會哪一個？    -都會

332
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,151
幾何學和說話

333
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,364
茹絲，給我…

334
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,996
你能算出這份資料的空間曲線嗎？

335
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,542
用格拉姆施…    -正交化演演算法

336
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,378
比歐幾里得座標來得好

337
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,966
好，很好

338
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,885
很好，下班前給我

339
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,178
好的

340
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,681
我還要你不時檢查一下

341
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,350
史塔佛先生和其他人的數學計算

342
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,518
那個我行的，艾爾

343
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,562
我知道你行，我確定他們都行

344
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,188
但如果真是那樣

345
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,899
防熱罩的擋板就不會脫落了吧？

346
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,904
打擾一下，大家聽我說好嗎？

347
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,575
謝謝

348
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,702
我要聲明

349
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,746
水星計劃的七人在14天后會來受訓

350
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,749
我非常肯定他們一定會…

351
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,835
問我們關於工作的問題

352
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,045
我想這是很合理的

353
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,173
畢竟我們要把人放上飛彈

354
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,340
發射到太空里

355
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,884
而且沒有前例可循

356
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,678
因為這是前所未見的

357
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,222
我們現在的所作所為都非常重要

358
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,434
對他們的妻子…

359
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,187
對他們的孩子都很重要

360
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,898
對整個國家都很重要

361
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:55,028
這個太空任務團隊會被大肆宣傳

362
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,448
美國最厲害的工程師及科學家

363
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,451
一定不反對自己的工作接受檢驗

364
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,619
是不是，保羅？

365
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,120
是的，長官

366
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,206
很好，讓我們一致阿們同意，媽的

367
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,373
阿們

368
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,126
阿們    -阿們

369
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,878
好了

370
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,116
我的數字絕對沒錯

371
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,995
我會驗算的，先生，沒問題

372
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,507
這樣我不能…    -檢查你能看的範圍

373
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,468
其他部分是機密，你不能看

374
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,821
這些是哈里遜先生給我的數字

375
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,948
是，我要…    -抱歉

376
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,616
請問洗手間在哪裡？

377
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,327
抱歉，我不清楚你的洗手間在哪裡

378
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,538
是，先生

379
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,124
是，先生

380
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,319
「女用洗手間」

381
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,742
「太空總署」

382
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:36,773
「有色人種女用洗手間」

383
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:55,958
茹絲

384
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,126
什麼事，哈里遜先生？

385
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,921
茹絲，算數字的女生呢？

386
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,256
去…休息

387
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,300
我們有休息時間嗎？

388
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,974
「西側計算組」

389
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,454
我的天，你去哪裡了？

390
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,789
你算完了嗎？

391
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,667
差不多，他說下班前完成

392
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,919
這裡說下班前意思是昨天前

393
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,338
先做那些

394
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:43,923
他要你先做這些    -好

395
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,091
快點

396
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,342
抱歉

397
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,803
有人在算了

398
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,778
「查克堅果咖啡」

399
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,661
哈里遜先生

400
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,499
喔，放著就好

401
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,754
史塔佛的防熱罩計算結果呢？

402
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,924
我很難確定，先生

403
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,092
很難確定

404
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,553
你知道我們在做什麼嗎？

405
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,098
想辦法把人送上太空，先生

406
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,433
沒錯

407
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,394
沒錯，所以那些可以丟了

408
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,896
您說什麼？

409
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,524
我說那可以丟了

410
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,025
給我

411
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,611
我不是污辱你的工作

412
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,363
只是這些都過時了

413
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,740
這裡的節奏就是這麼快

414
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,284
如果需要道歉，我會整天都在道歉

415
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,871
我要你和這裡的每個人做的…

416
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,123
這裡所有天才要做的

417
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,959
是跳脫眼前的數字

418
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,795
觀察數字的周圍

419
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,588
看穿這些數字

420
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,966
找出我們還沒想到的問題的答案

421
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,802
找到還不存在的數學

422
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,763
因為沒有這些，我們哪也去不了

423
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,640
我們只能留在地面上

424
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,393
我們飛不進太空，無法繞行地球

425
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,270
絕對無法登陸月球

426
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,646
但在我心裡…

427
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,149
在我心裡，我已經到月球了

428
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,444
你呢？

429
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,155
是的，長官

430
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,324
很好

431
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,119
因為我不需要另一個聰明的計算機

432
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,832
我可以走了嗎，先生？

433
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,837
可以，走吧

434
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,506
你可以走了

435
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,041
我們等了好久，下次你搭巴士吧

436
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,459
她心情不好

437
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,480
我這十年沒遲到過一天

438
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,232
沒有請過病假，沒有抱怨過

439
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,902
準時交出工作，做得又正確又好

440
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,403
不公平，這就是事實

441
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,198
不公平的是我要負主管的責任

442
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,908
但沒有頭銜沒有薪資水準

443
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,160
還要看著你們升職

444
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,913
不要誤會了

445
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,582
任何人升職都是提升我們的地位

446
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,752
只是我沒有任何進展

447
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,920
老實說，桃樂斯

448
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,339
我不知道自己能不能適應那裡

449
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,759
一週后我就會回到計算組了

450
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,719
或是直接丟了這份工作

451
00:27:58,886 --> 00:27:59,929
拜託

452
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,765
你是這裡數學最好的人，你也知道

453
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,892
你只要筆動得跟腦袋一樣快

454
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,560
你就沒問題了

455
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,604
然後你給我放尊重一點

456
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,607
腳不要放在儀表板，又不是你家客廳

457
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,697
我聽起來就像主管，對吧？

458
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,448
刻薄又嚴厲的老主管

459
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,450
而且大權在握，毫無疑問

460
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,620
別想跟范恩女士耍花招

461
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,373
音樂大聲一點

462
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:44,974
晚安，凱薩琳

463
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,142
再見，小凱

464
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,143
晚安，兩位

465
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,477
明天見    -再見

466
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:58,612
寶貝，你回來了

467
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,822
媽媽，我回來了

468
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,159
我正想通報國民警衛隊呢

469
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,955
對不起，媽媽，我有新工作

470
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,915
是太空任務團隊

471
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,084
我的天，聽起來好重要

472
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,919
是升職嗎？

473
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,964
應該算小升職吧

474
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,049
你想要這份工作吧？

475
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,511
應該是

476
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,430
雖然有點挑戰性…

477
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,766
沒有你應付不來的，凱薩琳

478
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,311
謝謝，媽媽

479
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,022
他們都睡了嗎？

480
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,815
他們假裝睡了

481
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,067
你在做什麼？    -我不…

482
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,986
他們裝得不夠好

483
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:39,904
康斯坦絲

484
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,989
謝謝媽媽，我愛你

485
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:43,699
這是我的床    -不是

486
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:44,533
下去啦

487
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,118
回你的床去，我比較大    -不要

488
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,328
你在幹嘛？    -下去啦

489
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,704
你們在做什麼？

490
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:51,457
喬樂黛可以自己睡，不公平

491
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,250
她只不過年紀最大而已

492
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,877
這樣很公平    -不公平

493
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,378
很公平    -才不是

494
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,756
康斯坦絲，凱西，坐下

495
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,095
我知道…

496
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,015
你們想長大，有自己的空間

497
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,561
所以睡在喬樂黛的位置的小孩

498
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,438
還需要洗碗

499
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,398
拿垃圾去倒

500
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,526
還有喬樂黛負責的所有家事

501
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,529
那算了，不用換了

502
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,572
跟她睡也沒那麼糟

503
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:26,617
好

504
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:30,371
別再讓我回家還看到你們這樣吵了

505
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,957
你們應該早就睡著了

506
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,667
我們只是想跟你說晚安

507
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,419
你去上班300個小時了

508
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,715
我知道，我現在做的是全職工作

509
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,384
你們都知道的啊

510
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,180
我要當媽媽，還有爸爸

511
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,603
我和你們一樣想你們爸爸

512
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,565
他和天使在一起

513
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,692
對，他和所有天使在一起

514
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,527
而且看顧著我們

515
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,946
分分秒秒，知道嗎？

516
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,490
所以我們要堅強

517
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,533
好嗎？

518
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,034
好，媽媽    -好，媽媽

519
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,578
你們都休息了，好嗎？

520
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,037
媽媽？

521
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,205
什麼事，寶貝？

522
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,125
俄國人打算攻擊我們嗎？

523
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,835
你從哪裡聽來的？

524
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,378
我們今天都要躲在桌子下

525
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,463
彎著身體縮在一起

526
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,133
好，寶貝，那是演習

527
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,759
意思是先練習

528
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,889
這樣萬一發生什麼事才能安全

529
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,311
我們其實也不知道他們想幹嘛

530
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,979
你也要上太空嗎？

531
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,522
沒有，寶貝

532
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,901
但我會盡我所能

533
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,070
幫那些勇敢的人上太空，就是這樣

534
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,073
你想的話也可以飛到太空，媽媽

535
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,700
你可以當太空人

536
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,785
這是你畫的？    -對，媽媽

537
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,122
那是我嗎？

538
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,290
對啊

539
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,167
你看到了嗎？

540
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,253
我的天啊

541
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,005
我愛你，寶貝

542
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,090
我知道

543
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,634
過來

544
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,178
好，真的要睡覺了喔

545
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:10,721
好嗎？

546
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,640
我愛你們    -晚安

547
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:13,807
晚安

548
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,893
我很喜歡你的畫，寶貝

549
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,819
感謝主

550
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,157
讚美神    -讚美神

551
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,451
哈利路亞    -哈利路亞

552
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,579
哈利路亞

553
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,457
讚美神

554
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,169
改變即將來臨

555
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:47,466
從南方基督教領袖會

556
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,593
到好牧師金恩博士

557
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,095
阿門    -哈利路亞

558
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,556
到坐在北卡萊納州餐廳抗議的學生

559
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:55,683
沒錯    -是，先生

560
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,727
祂毫無保留地信任我們

561
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,690
美善的主讓我們的女性

562
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,441
建造太空船

563
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,699
我們還有國民警衛隊

564
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,033
捍衛我們的自由

565
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,494
讓我們大聲讚美吉姆強生上校

566
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,124
神的恩惠帶他回鄉

567
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,336
在漢普頓這裡成立國民警衛隊

568
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,755
一起說哈利路亞吧

569
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,924
哈利路亞

570
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,555
我不懂

571
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,724
我不懂

572
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,308
我不想再講一次，好嗎？

573
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,269
女性工程師？

574
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,438
女性工程師？

575
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,524
我們是黑人，你知道那是不可能的

576
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,984
那邊不一樣，里凡

577
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,527
你不能申請獲得自由

578
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,405
受壓迫的人必須爭取自由

579
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,073
你要提出要求、去爭取

580
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,075
不要跟我說那些口號

581
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,828
要達到目標的方法不只一種

582
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:58,829
我不想吃蔬菜

583
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,956
我說過不要插嘴吧？

584
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,833
吃吃看這個，寶貝

585
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,794
好

586
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,755
小孩就是要吃蔬菜

587
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,882
小孩必須吃掉自己的蔬菜

588
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,759
你如果在家就會知道這件事

589
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,055
你最好別再說了，里凡傑克森

590
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,975
除非你想讓我在這裡說出真心話

591
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,479
我的意思是…

592
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,355
你別白費力氣

593
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,399
我不想看到你受傷

594
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,485
太空總署從來沒有善待過你們

595
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,237
多拿兩個學位也不會改變什麼

596
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,908
爭取人權的方法不一定文明

597
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,248
我也不想吃蔬菜了

598
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,458
不要頂嘴，小女孩

599
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,043
哥哥有吃，你也要吃

600
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,465
我聽說他打算留在這區

601
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,843
是嗎？那很好

602
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,471
凱薩琳，過去發展第二春啊

603
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,682
吉姆上校真是秀色可餐

604
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,142
的確是

605
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,853
又高又壯，還有權威

606
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,272
我打賭他晚上也是一樣

607
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,025
瑪莉，今天是禮拜日

608
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,527
拜託你收斂一點

609
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,903
我才不要

610
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,156
他在朝我們這裡笑

611
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,533
他在對你笑

612
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,288
我才不會迴應

613
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,248
你要對他笑

614
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,250
孩子，你嘴都合不攏了    -我沒有

615
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,669
過來這裡

616
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,129
他要過來了

617
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,505
他為什麼要過來？

618
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,257
因為瑪莉跟他揮手    -不要

619
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,050
我還沒準備好    -太晚了，快梳頭

620
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:35,968
你好，上校

621
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,470
我是桃樂斯范恩

622
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,597
她是瑪莉傑克森，她先生是里凡

623
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,307
我認識里凡，很高興認識你們

624
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,851
這是凱薩琳哥柏女士

625
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,769
她目前單身，是寡婦

626
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,105
有三個美麗的女兒

627
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,273
她們都很乖

628
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,650
我們都說她們是地上的天使

629
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,443
桃樂斯，要吃派嗎？

630
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,112
我很想吃

631
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,780
借過

632
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,949
你剛剛才吃過派    -又怎樣

633
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,497
我要幫三個孩子裝點食物

634
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,874
我來幫你

635
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,084
好啊

636
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,253
水果沙拉，對

637
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,632
牧師提到你在太空總署負責計算

638
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:16,550
是的

639
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,093
工作內容是什麼？

640
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,014
我們做必要的數學計算

641
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,725
實現太空計劃的發射和著陸

642
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,394
聽起來很嚴肅

643
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,604
是的

644
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,480
他們讓女人處理這種…

645
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,069
我不是那個意思

646
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,571
你是什麼意思？

647
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,702
我只是很驚訝這麼…

648
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,705
困難的事…

649
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,415
強生先生

650
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,710
如果我是你，現在就會閉嘴

651
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,128
我無意冒犯你

652
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,631
我是西維吉尼亞…

653
00:36:55,797 --> 00:37:00,260
州立大學研究所首位黑人女學生

654
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,221
我每天都在分析…

655
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:07,017
壓力計排氣量、摩擦力、速率資料

656
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:11,480
計算一萬多筆的三角函式與平方根

657
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,690
最近還在算解析幾何

658
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:14,691
用手算

659
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:19,780
西側計算組有20位聰明的黑人女性

660
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:22,366
為國家貢獻己力讓我們引以為榮

661
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,201
所以，是的

662
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,787
女效能在太空總署做事，強生先生

663
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,748
而且不是因為我們穿裙子

664
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,334
是因為我們戴眼鏡

665
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,962
祝你今天愉快

666
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,300
「太空總署」

667
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,227
史考特，歡迎來到朗里

668
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:52,771
歡迎來到朗里    -歡迎

669

謝謝

那是艾倫薛帕，美國海軍飛行員

672
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,497
他會是第一個進入太空的人

673
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,333
那是史考特卡本特、華特舒拉

674
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,043
都是海軍飛行員

675
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,963
大概都180公分，80公斤

676
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,715
智商超過130

677
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,800
而且長得帥一定也是條件之一

678
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,678
你怎麼能對那些白人拋媚眼？

679
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:28,015
我有平等的權利看各種膚色的帥哥

680
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,934
那是約翰格倫

681
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,269
他是唯一的海軍陸戰隊飛行員

682
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,980
各位先生，這裡還有很多要看的

683
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,898
可是我們還沒握完所有人的手

684
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,650
我們的行程很趕，上校

685

686
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,111

687
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:42,279
我正看著他

688
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:45,449
各位女士，我不想不告而別

689
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,117
我們好像有點趕時間

690
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,244
俄國人絕對沒有放慢腳步

691

692

你們在太空總署的工作是什麼？

693

694
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,088

695

格倫先生，工程部的瑪莉傑克森

696
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,510

697
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:06,887
謝謝，瑪莉

約翰

699
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,849
我們進去吧    -是，先生

700
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,642
各位    -很高興認識你們

701
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,144
謝謝你，上校    -祝您好運

我做不到

這部門已經有…

711
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,572
兩個工程師和我確認過數字

712
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,825

716
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,282

恐怕沒有，先生

你要我們停下來嗎？

720
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,752
不，就…

721
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,881
就繼續下去吧

722
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,509
事實上，用大鎯頭吧

723
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:10,635
是，長官

724
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,804
聽到了沒，去拿大鎯頭

725

現在是休息時間，沒有問題

731

既然你都來了

732
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,805

你知道技術部那邊在蓋什麼嗎？

737
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,988
叫IBM的東西

凱薩琳哥柏，長官

753
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,300
你好    -你好

754
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:58,136
你怎麼知道紅石撐不了軌道飛行？

755
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,304
那是機密資訊

756
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,430
是最高機密

757
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,266

764

765
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,078
我們知道發射地到軌道間的距離

766
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,456
知道紅石火箭和水星座艙的重量

不，長官

對，但是你不符合學歷要求

00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,944
儘管違憲，這裡還是有種族隔離

836
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,405
他們絕對不會讓黑人女性

837
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:47,574
在全白人的學校上課

838
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,492
聽起來沒錯

839
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,411
你只會說這個嗎？

840
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:54,455
我才不想聽你整天抱怨

841
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,623
我們在玩牌

842
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,292
去法院請願，爭取你要的

843
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,877
但不要光說不練

844
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,506
我在抱怨嗎？    -好幾天了

845
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:04,424
各位女士

846
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:08,011
不準再講工作的事了

847
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,304
算我一份

848
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,221
凱薩琳？

849
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,806
來吧    -糟了

850
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,016
過來    -你來

851
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,059
孩子，我就需要這個

852
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,227
謝謝你

853
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,982
不要再讓她喝了，凱薩琳

854
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,276
不會了，因為她喝完了

855
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:25,695
聽著，我沒事

856
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,780
我完全沒有問題

857
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,699
你完全喝醉了

858
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,660
我們來跳舞啦，姊妹們

859
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,538
來嘛，小凱，來跳舞

860
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:36,998
去和她跳舞，凱薩琳

861
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,666
快點，去玩啊

862
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,792
把它藏起來

863
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,836
我們教你跳舞    -你跳吧

864
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,922
就這樣    -音樂太小聲了

865
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,924
我們要教你怎麼追男人    -這就對了

866
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,675
教我？你說什麼？    -快點

867
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,469
你要知道怎麼跳舞

868
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,095
慢，慢    -就這樣

869
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,222
轉一圈    -轉、轉

870
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,850
對了    -轉、轉、轉

871
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,310
看看她，桃樂斯

872
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,479
這樣能在那些舞蹈比賽中獲勝嗎？

873
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:00,897
轉一圈

874
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,359
然後在外面啊

875
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,818
比媽媽的還好嗎？

876
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,236
其實沒有

877
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,613
結束種族隔離

878
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,032
結束種族隔離

879
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,784
結束種族隔離

880
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,036
結束種族隔離

881
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:16,955
結束種族隔離

882
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,084
「60年代的領袖，尼克森總統」

883
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,003

884
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,130

00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,976
「注意，他們必定…」

888
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,649
我們不想惹麻煩

889
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,443
我不是來找麻煩的，女士

890
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,736
你們在這裡幹嘛？

891
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,488
來找書

892
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,032
有色人種區也有書

893
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,035
但沒有我要找的書

894
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,329
那也沒辦法

895
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,001
「漢普頓公立圖書館」

896
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:03,710
走吧，你們很清楚規定

897
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,462
手拿開，不要碰我兒子

898
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,132
希望你今天愉快

899
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,019
隔離與平等是兩件事

900
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,771
現在的情況不代表就是對的

901
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,023
懂嗎？

902
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:26,858
知道了，媽媽

903
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:29,360
你們的行為正確，就沒有錯

904
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,154
這是一定的

905
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,321
懂嗎？

906
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,573
知道了，媽媽

907
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,456
你拿了那本書，媽媽？

908
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,541
兒子，我有繳稅

909
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,710
圖書館裡的一切都是用稅買的

910
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,879

00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,611
許願    -許願

916
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:13,196
吹蠟燭，再一次

917
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,864
很棒

918
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:18,034
里奧德，你該找工作了

919
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,077
兩份工作

920
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:21,829
你的小孩九歲了，你什麼打算？

921
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,498
謝謝，你來得正是時候

922
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:24,957
看看誰來了

923
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,085
誰？    -真是驚喜

924
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,795
沒什麼好抱怨的

925
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:30,880
最好是驚喜

926
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,800
一定是霍華邀請他的    -對

927
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:36,677
我去幫忙弄花

928
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,231
華特，你乖一點

929
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,900
你知道，我…    -對

930
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,529
寶貝就是這樣，扭一扭

931
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,323
對，就是這樣

932
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,329
很高興見到你    -謝謝

933
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,965
我應該向你道歉

934
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,718
剛剛算嗎？

935
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:21,097
能讓我在跳舞時道歉嗎？

936
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,736
我那天好像說錯話了，哥柏女士

937
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:40,241
我離開有一陣子了

938
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,953
我想我有點脫節了

939
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:45,830
嗯

940
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,916
我希望你再給我一次機會

941
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,377
嗯

942
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,671
老實說

943
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,506
我想多認識你一些

944
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:57,425
嗯

945
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,053
你很難取悅

946
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,266
你還沒說對不起

947
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:06,642
也是

948
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:07,894
沒錯

949
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:13,858
對不起，凱薩琳

950
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:15,234
為什麼，吉姆？

951
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,820
我小看你了

952
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,489
小看了像你這樣的女性

953
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,827
但我想能和你並駕齊驅的也不多

954
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,040
這樣才算正式的道歉

955
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,546
音樂暫停播出，新聞快報

956
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,924
蘇聯新聞單位宣佈

957
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:42,428
俄國太空人尤里加加林成為首位…

958
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,972
在太空完成繞行地球軌道的人

959
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,225
耗時108分鐘

960
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,603
繼續收聽本臺隨時提供的最新訊息

961
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,106
看來我們被拋在後頭了

962
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,483
東方號火箭

963
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,485
將俄國太空人加加林的3KA座艙…

966

7點55分重新進入俄國領空

967
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,871

加加林獲頒列寧勳章與金星…

969
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,918
我們輸得一敗塗地

970
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,211
走吧

971
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,588
並獲得…    -去搞清楚怎麼飛到太空

972
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,007
蘇聯第一太空人頭銜

973
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,969
被尊稱為國家英雄

974
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:26,055
這是前所未有的勝利之日

975
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:28,015
俄國太空計劃

976
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:32,478
在太空競賽中痛擊美國

977
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,480
謝謝各位留下來

978
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,775
我知道很晚了，看到那些…

979
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,569
我相信大家都急著想回家

980
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,364
在回去前，我要問一個問題

981
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:48,577
也是我一直問自己的一個問題

982
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:49,829
也就是…

983
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:55,209
我們怎麼會在兩人賽中拿第二名？

984
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:56,919
有人能回答我嗎？

985
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:58,963
保羅？

986
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,175
我想格倫說得對，他們比我們努力

987
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,553
我必須這麼想，因為…

988
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,389
我拒絕相信俄國人比我們聰明

989
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,684
或是他們比較進步，比較認真

990
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:15,229
但我不知道，這可能嗎？

991
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,317
有沒有可能他們就是比較在乎？

992
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:24,030
我們現在處於危及存亡之秋

993
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:26,490
不是什麼輕鬆愉快之旅

994
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:30,494
有七張臉孔露出不信任我們的表情

995
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,792
這是我們的問題

996
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,211
所以現在…

997
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,049
你們只需要記住兩件事

998
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:46,052
一，留下來加班就是你們的人生

999
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,181
二，不要妄想你們會領到加班費

1000

而其他人…

1004
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,111
我建議你們打電話回家

他們弄不好那個系統的

什麼叫「沒有你的洗手間」？

這裡沒有洗手間

1067

喔，我沒有珍珠

因為有色人種拿的薪水買不起珍珠

「漢普頓晚報：甘迺迪瞄準月球」

1165
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:10,754
我們應該要感謝甘迺迪總統

1166
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,839
幫我們保住了工作

1167
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,553
古斯葛利森是下一個

1168
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,014
他也要搭紅石火箭進行次軌道飛行

1169
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,351
這是格倫搭擎天神號前的最後機會

1170
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:27,020
老天保佑我們能讓他回來

1171
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,524
對，我猜他會希望我們先算好數學

1172
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,069
做得好，各位

1173
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:36,363
回去陪小孩吃飯吧

1174
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,073
然後再回來工作

1175
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,233
我想這是親你的好時機

1176
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:16,570
為什麼？

1177
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,741
我想你也喜歡我，像我喜歡你一樣

1178
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:24,953
是嗎？    -對

1179
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,248
不然你早就要我回家了

1180
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:45,265
我很久沒和男人接吻了

1181
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,767
幾乎快忘記怎麼做了

1182
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,202
FBI逮捕涉嫌在阿拉巴馬州…

1183
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,955
攻擊黑人解放團體巴士的四名白人

1184
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,540
寶貝    -巴士里很快…

1185
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,791
媽媽    -瀰漫黑煙

1186
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,168
我們都趴在地上

1187
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,545
所有人都發現巴士著火了

1188
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,797
必須逃出去才行

1189
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,508
小孩不需要看這些    -他們需要看

1190
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,219
我們在伯明罕逃出巴士后

1191
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,803
每個人都該看

1192
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,680
有人硬把我拉出門

1193
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,015
然後被丟進人群里

1194
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:29,809
後來有個大傢伙和幾個人一起揍我

1195
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,146
我們認為自己是為國家奉獻

1196
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,982
這不只是爲了我們而奮鬥

1197
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,985
是爲了拯救美國的靈魂而奮鬥

1198
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,320
瑪莉傑克森

1199
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,990
請願前往漢普頓高中修課

1200
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,870
早安，庭上

1201
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,002
漢普頓高中是白人學校，女士

1202
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,422
是的，庭上，我瞭解

1203
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,341
維吉尼亞州還是實施種族隔離

1204
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,385
不管聯邦政府怎麼說

1205
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,720
不管最高法院怎麼說

1206
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:07,681
我們的法律才是法律

1207
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:10,684
庭上，請容我說句話

1208
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,603
我相信有些特殊情況可以考慮

1209
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,523
有什麼能讓黑人女性唸白人學校？

1210
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,193
我能上前嗎，庭上？

1211
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,374
庭上

1212
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:38,086
您應該最能瞭解首開先例的重要性

1213
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,547
怎麼說，傑克森女士？

1214
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:45,302
您是家族中最早加入美軍的成員

1215
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,636
美國海軍

1216
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,139
最早念大學的家族成員

1217
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:50,807
喬治梅森大學

1218
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,226
也是最早連任的州法官

1219
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,729
連續三位州長都任命您

1220
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,564
你有做功課

1221
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,274
是的，庭上

1222
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,067
你的重點是什麼？

1223
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,569
重點是，庭上

1224
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:04,904
維吉尼亞州從未有黑人女性

1225
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,407
曾經到全白人學校念過書

1226
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:08,575
這是前所未聞的事

1227
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,327
是的，前所未聞

1228
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,747
在艾倫薛帕坐在火箭上之前

1229
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,957
沒有美國人曾經到過太空

1230
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,460
現在，他將永遠被世人記住

1231
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:21,087
這個出身新罕布夏州的美國海軍

1232
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,797
是第一個進入星空的人

1233
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,134
而我，庭上

1234
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,803
我要成為太空總署的工程師

1235
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,930
但沒有修白人學校的課程

1236
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,766
我就做不到這件事

1237
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:36,186
我不能改變我的膚色

1238
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:40,523
所以我不得不選擇做先鋒

1239
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:43,318
但沒有您，我無法成功

1240
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,445
庭上

1241
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:48,114
您今天將聽見各種案件

1242
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:51,451
100年後，哪一個案子是重要的？

1243
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:54,371
哪一個案子能讓您首開先例？

1244
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:07,300
只能上夜校

1245
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:09,636
傑克森女士

1246
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,187
太好了

1247
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:20,480
太好了

1248
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,192
我的天，我不敢相信

1249
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:31,199
「葛利森發射著陸計劃  作者…」

1250
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:45,422
「保羅史塔佛與凱薩琳哥柏」

1251
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:50,093
他說他會遲到多久？    -抱歉

1252
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,553
最多五分鐘

1253
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,221
古斯葛利森的座標

1254
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:56,391
我想先算約翰格倫的軌道

1255
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,185
你知道自己在說什麼嗎？

1256
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:02,605
擎天神火箭的軌道發射需要時間

1257
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,524
有什麼問題嗎？

1258
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,026
哈里遜先生

1259
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,446
我在想…

1260
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:13,116
我這輩子都在想，你就說吧

1261
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:15,201
長官

1262
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:20,707
我想先算約翰格倫的軌道

1263
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:23,126
這不是加加減減，是要發明數學

1264
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:26,045
我們討論過了，那種數學不存在

1265
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:27,213
我做得到，長官

1266
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,383
你知道這些計算要多精準嗎？

1267
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:33,052
像從300公尺外發射短型霰彈槍

1268
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,889
子彈還要通過小得看不見的洞一樣

1269
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,974
我看看    -我的槍法很準，長官

1270
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,060
葛利森的數字怎麼樣？

1271
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,729
完全正確

1272
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,608
試算格倫的軌道吧

1273
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,736
但要和史塔佛確認，懂嗎？

1274
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:50,653
是，長官

1275
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,489
謝謝您

1276
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,453
計算人員不能列為作者

1277
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,377
座艙指揮中心，這裡是自由鐘7號

1278
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:07,086
「1961年7月21日」

1279
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:07,795
「收回古斯葛利森」

1280
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:08,838
很清楚

1281
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,967
好，到現在為止都很好

1282
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:13,927
收到

1283
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:17,931
自由鐘7號，杭特1號準備伸勾回收

1284
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,308
自由鐘7號聽見了，結束

1285
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,352
艙口蓋爆炸了，座艙指揮中心

1286
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:25,772
自由鐘7號座艙下沉

1287
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:27,815
古斯葛利森已經離開座艙

1288
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:31,611
救援人員要把他從海水中拉出來

1289
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:35,823
可惜自由鐘7號座艙無法回收

1290
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,991
媽媽

1291
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:39,953
不行，我不行    -瑪莉

1292
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,462
哈里遜先生，納稅人的錢和座艙…

1293
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:50,964
一起沉到海底了

1294
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,967
你怎麼能確保約翰格倫安全回來？

1295
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,051
先聽我說

1296
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,637
發現的目的不是爲了發現本身

1297
01:15:57,804 --> 01:15:59,889
而是爲了人類的生存

1298
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,809
而且必然伴隨著風險

1299
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,479
先成功的人就能制訂規則

1300
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,648
所有文明都是如此

1301
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,360
所以，我認為各位更應該考慮的是

1302
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:16,197
你們希望誰在太空中發號施令？

1303
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,825
我們必須知道外面有什麼，參議員

1304
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:23,413
我們必須進入太空才能保障生存

1305
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,415
只有一個人能做到這件事

1306
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,253
我們會，也必須讓格倫安全回來

1307
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,506
因為他要告訴我們他看到什麼

1308
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:39,012
紅石火箭直接往上飛

1309
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,849
但座艙速度太慢無法進入軌道

1310
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:47,228
飛行路線是地球、次軌道、地球

1311
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,022
這是已知的計算方式

1312
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:51,691
成功讓薛帕、葛利森進入太空

1313
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,027
但不適用于格倫

1314
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:56,613
那麼擎天神火箭…

1315
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:59,198
能將我們推進軌道

1316
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,535
向上升，讓座艙進入橢圓軌道

1317
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,079
讓地球的重力拉住它

1318
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,874
但是速度夠快所以不會撞上地球

1319
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:09,792
所以才能停留在軌道上

1320
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,253
至於讓它回來…

1321
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,714
是我們還不知道的計算

1322
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:17,759
凱薩琳，請說

1323
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,595
所以座艙會一直繞著地球

1324
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:22,722
因為沒有減速的力量？

1325
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:24,390
沒錯

1326
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,560
使它在正確的時刻慢下來

1327
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:29,270
慢的程度也要恰到好處

1328
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:30,438
就是我們要算的

1329
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:34,609
凱薩琳，請說

1330
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:38,237
所以它要從橢圓軌道…

1331
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,824
進入拋物線軌道

1332
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:42,992
對

1333
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,828
這就是返航關鍵點

1334
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,997
完全沒有犯錯的空間

1335
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:50,124
如果他太快掉回來…

1336
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,918
重返大氣層時會著火

1337
01:17:52,085 --> 01:17:53,336
沒錯

1338
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:54,796
如果回來得太慢…

1339
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,589
他會被地球的重力推走

1340
01:17:56,756 --> 01:18:00,093
任何改變，質量、重量、速度

1341
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:03,596
時間、距離、摩擦力、風吹草動

1342
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,516
都會改變返航關鍵點

1343
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:09,644
我們就要重新計算

1344
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,104
對

1345
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:16,609
我們要能選擇重返大氣層的位置

1346
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:19,779
這個返航關鍵點必須很精確

1347
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:20,655
山姆

1348
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:25,118
這些是目前紅石座艙的最新數字

1349
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,953
顯然我們知道發射點

1350
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:27,787
謝謝

1351
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:31,541
國防部的簡報會說明海軍回收區

1352
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,168
然後我們再往回推算

1353
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:37,839
剩下就靠我們了，開始工作吧

1354
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:39,549
史塔佛先生

1355
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:40,800
什麼事，凱薩琳？

1356
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:44,512
如果讓我參加簡報對計劃會更有用

1357
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:46,514
國防部簡報不對外開放

1358
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:50,977
對，但如果我們不知道改變

1359
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:52,145
就不能立刻跟上

1360
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,731
我需要馬上知道改變，這不能出錯

1361
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,649
凱薩琳，我們的工作就是這樣

1362
01:18:56,816 --> 01:19:00,528
你要做，就用現有的資料算

1363
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:02,655
不然我們就找做得到的人來

1364
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,413
好

1365
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:24,385
好女孩

1366
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,722
你在幹嘛？你不能進來這裡

1367
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:28,931
你是誰？

1368
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,017
我是西側計算組的

1369
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,519
我是桃樂斯范恩，先生

1370
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,354
這是很精密的裝置

1371
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,190
抱歉，先生，我只是想幫忙

1372
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,065
最好是

1373
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,609
比爾，數字出來了

1374
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:43,696
哪一種數字？

1375
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,118
真想不到

1376
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:51,287
你剛說你叫什麼名字？

1377
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:53,414
桃樂斯范恩

1378
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,042
桃樂斯范恩

1379
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:03,090
「友誼7號發射預測」

1380
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:05,676
長官，這是友誼7號的參數

1381
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,386
這些都還沒確定

1382
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,430
我們要修改座艙的窗戶

1383
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,057
什麼時候改的？    -6分鐘前

1384
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:12,683
數字改變了，重算

1385
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:16,103
長官，讓我參加簡報就能即時…

1386
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,772
凱薩琳，我們談過這件事了

1387
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:20,066
不可能，沒有女性與會的相關規定

1388
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,069
也沒有男性繞行地球的相關規定

1389
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:25,863
總之事情就是這樣

1390
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:50,638
「友誼7號發射預測  作者…」

1391
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,604
「保羅史塔佛與凱薩琳哥柏」

1392
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:03,150
窗戶變更后的格倫上校發射座標

1393
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:06,112
我說過計算人員不能署名，重做

1394
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:08,406
那些是我算的，應該有我的名字

1395
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:10,449
事情就不是這樣的

1396
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,952
保羅，怎麼回事？

1397
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:15,329
哈里遜先生，我想參加今天的簡報

1398
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:16,581
為什麼？

1399
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,417
數據改變得很快，座艙設計也會變

1400
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:22,587
重量和著陸區每天都在變

1401
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:26,090
你們開完會，本來算好的又要重算

1402
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,968
格倫上校還有幾周就要升空了

1403
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,344
我們還沒算出正確的數字

1404
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,139
為什麼她不能開會？

1405
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,307
因為她等級不夠，艾爾

1406
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:35,975
如果我不能儘快…

1407
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:38,477
拿到數據和資訊

1408
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,645
工作就沒有效率

1409
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,355
我要一起開會，同步獲得資訊

1410
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:44,442
平民不能參加國防部機密簡報

1411
01:21:44,609 --> 01:21:46,485
我覺得我是說明計算的最佳人選

1412
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,487
你不會放棄的吧？    -我不會

1413
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:50,698
她是女人，沒有相關規定…

1414
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:53,326
讓女性參加會議    -聽到了，保羅

1415
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,872
但是在這些墻後面…

1416
01:21:58,873 --> 01:22:00,374
是誰制訂規則？

1417
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,001
是您，您才是長官

1418
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:04,837
只是你得展現長官的魄力

1419
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,348
你要安靜

1420
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:17,266
謝謝您

1421
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:19,310
早安

1422
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:21,479
各位先生

1423
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:33,866
這是軌道與發射時機處的凱薩琳

1424
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,244
她的工作和今天的內容相關

1425
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:39,497
過來

1426
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:41,874
給她張椅子吧？

1427
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:44,710
我們已經確認發射時機…

1428
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:46,170
請給她椅子    -是，長官

1429
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:48,506
我們確認了友誼7號的發射時機

1430
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:49,840
現在討論著陸區

1431
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:52,718
海軍需要單一著陸區

1432
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:55,179
我們能回收的區域是52平方公里

1433
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:56,347
超出這個範圍

1434
01:22:56,514 --> 01:22:58,224
座艙可能就無法回收

1435
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:00,685
我們希望有三個可能的回收點

1436
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:01,936
我們不可能涵蓋大半個海洋

1437
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,856
無意冒犯，但座艙設計每天都在變

1438
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,026
現在繞行地球的速度是多少？

1439
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,785
火箭把座艙送到低軌道的速度…

1440
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:21,122
是每小時28,234公里

1441
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:26,210
這張超速罰單可有得瞧了

1442
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:29,797
好

1443
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:32,591
我們有飛行速度、發射時機

1444
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,761
現在討論的著陸區是巴哈馬群島

1445
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:37,638
這樣可以算出返航關鍵點了嗎？

1446
01:23:37,805 --> 01:23:39,265
理論上來說可以

1447
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:41,058
現在不能只有理論了

1448
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:44,478
我們用這些資訊就能算出返航關鍵點

1449
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,605
什麼時候能算好？

1450
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:57,950
凱薩琳

1451
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,580
開始算吧

1452
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:32,693
可成功重新進入大氣層的位置

1453
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:36,697
距離格倫上校的著陸點4,812公里

1454
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:39,116
假設著陸點在巴哈馬群島

1455
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:44,789
時速28,234公里

1456
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,540
重新進入大氣層

1457
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,043
113公尺

1458
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:51,378
傾斜角度是…

1459
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:54,840
46.56度

1460
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:56,383
距離…

1461
01:24:57,176 --> 01:25:00,679
速率的平方，正弦

1462
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,057
重力的平方

1463
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,645
正弦，10公尺

1464
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,315
這樣的距離是…

1465
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:17,238
6,257,657公尺…

1466
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,742
或4,812公里…

1467
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:28,916
或46.33度

1468
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:37,383
好，著陸區是北緯5.0667度

1469
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:40,553
西經77.3333度

1470
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,556
也就是這裡

1471
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:48,060
就在這裡

1472
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,396
加減52平方公里

1473
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:56,569
我喜歡她的數字

1474
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:59,238
謝謝

1475
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,577
前提是座艙重返大氣層的位置正確

1476
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:07,246
我們要怎麼確定這一點？

1477
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:09,957
這部分我們還沒算出來，各位

1478
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:11,876
我們正在努力

1479
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,087
凱薩琳

1480
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,260
這東西什麼時候能發揮它的價值？

1481
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:23,762
我們正在努力，哈里遜先生

1482
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:24,930
我需要更多人力

1483
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:26,932
要程式設計師輸入資訊卡

1484
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:29,602
敲鑼打鼓地去找    -好

1485
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,770
你是IBM的負責人對嗎？    -是的

1486
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,772
不擇手段也要找到人

1487
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,482
你要搞定，不然我就不付錢

1488
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:36,901
瞭解

1489
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,239
那個對了，那個也對

1490
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,409
你們全都拿不到薪水

1491
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,003
我？

1492
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:57,796
對，是暫時的

1493
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:00,090
我們需要IBM讓格倫升空

1494
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:03,594
主任工程師說你會寫程式卡之類的

1495
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,804
那這邊的女孩怎麼辦？

1496
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:09,934
計算人員來不及算出軌道飛行數字

1497
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,477
暫時會留在這裡

1498
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:13,354
以後呢？

1499
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:18,984
格倫升空后太空總署會解散計算組

1500
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:25,366
我不接受調職，除非她們跟著我

1501
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,284
你說什麼？

1502
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,954
我們需要人力才能寫程式

1503
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,330
我一個人做不來

1504
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:34,667
這些女孩都準備好了，隨時能上工

1505
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,380
各位

1506
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:43,384
我們調職了

1507
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:47,513
放下計算機，新工作用不到它們了

1508
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:12,538
「西側計算組」

1509
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,742
歡迎各位女士

1510
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,087
知道你的工作是什麼嗎，保羅？

1511
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,632
在人材中找到天才

1512
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:07,468
讓我們成功

1513
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:10,429
我們要不一起達到頂峰

1514
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:13,057
要不就全軍覆沒

1515
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:18,479
是，晚安，長官

1516
01:29:47,925 --> 01:29:50,094
我不知道幾點會到家

1517
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,929
學校九點下課

1518
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,517
你有什麼要說嗎？

1519
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:59,478
我想你可能需要這個

1520
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,109
你可以裝各種不同筆芯

1521
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:09,321
只要壓上面這邊

1522
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:12,157
然後筆芯會掉出來

1523
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,701
你再放新的進去

1524
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,663
就是新的筆了

1525
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,627
你會是一個好工程師的

1526
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:25,629
真的嗎？

1527
01:30:25,796 --> 01:30:26,880
真的

1528
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:30,801
沒有人能阻擋瑪莉傑克森

1529
01:30:30,968 --> 01:30:32,845
實現她的夢想

1530
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:34,972
連我也不能

1531
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:42,646
別再惹我生氣了

1532
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:44,022
是的，夫人

1533
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,653
也別害我遲到了

1534
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:51,321
你會遲到，我要讓你遲到

1535
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:52,906
你不會遲到啦

1536
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:00,539
好，各位先生

1537
01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:05,002
今天要講普朗克愛因斯坦波長關係

1538
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:10,215
有事嗎？

1539
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:12,843
我是瑪莉傑克森

1540
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,344
我註冊入學了

1541
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,892
這門課沒有對女性授課

1542
01:31:20,601 --> 01:31:22,603
教學方式應該不分男女都一樣

1543
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,356
我沒看到有色人種區

1544
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,275
我可以隨便坐嗎？

1545
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:34,865
謝謝

1546
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:40,746
好

1547
01:31:42,372 --> 01:31:43,373
普朗克-愛因斯坦

1548
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,126
問題出在…

1549
01:31:46,293 --> 01:31:51,089
座艙從橢圓軌道移到拋物線軌道

1550
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:54,301
這裡沒有數學公式

1551
01:31:54,468 --> 01:31:56,929
因為我們能計算髮射與著陸

1552
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,430
但沒有軌道轉換公式

1553
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:00,974
座艙就會留在軌道上，回不來地球

1554
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,103
也許我們根本想錯了

1555
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:06,605
怎麼說？

1556
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,778
也許根本不需要新的算式

1557
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:16,490
可能是舊的演算法

1558
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:21,411
用數字而不是理論來思考

1559
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,330
數學永遠是最可靠的

1560
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:25,666
對你來說是這樣

1561
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:33,340
歐拉公式

1562
01:32:33,507 --> 01:32:34,508
歐拉公式

1563
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:35,801
對

1564
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,136
那超古老的    -但是有用

1565
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:40,347
數學上行得通

1566
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,718
就是這個

1567
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:21,388
把它打出來

1568
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:22,556
好

1569
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:32,858
「友誼7號發射著陸分析  史塔佛」

1570
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:48,874
桃樂斯

1571
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,084
米契爾女士

1572
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:59,217
你今天加班了

1573
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:02,554
好像總是這樣

1574
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:04,723
對，好像是

1575
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:13,565
謝謝

1576
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:20,447
我聽說IBM發揮全力了

1577
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,241
你真的有能力使用它

1578
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:26,703
我爸爸教過我一些機械的知識

1579
01:34:27,621 --> 01:34:29,748
東側組這邊有幾個女生

1580
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:32,292
也想學習相關知識

1581
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:33,543
這是未來趨勢

1582
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:36,046
如果你不介意，我可以帶她們過去

1583
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:38,590
這不是我能決定的，女士

1584
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:40,801
主管才能決定

1585
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,428
你說的沒錯

1586
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,307
晚安，米契爾女士

1587
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:50,769
聽我說，桃樂斯

1588
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:54,398
不管你怎麼想…

1589
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,818
我對你們都沒有偏見

1590
01:34:57,984 --> 01:34:59,152
我知道

1591
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,489
我知道你可能真的這麼以為

1592
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:16,294
晚安，凱薩琳

1593
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:18,505
晚安

1594
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:22,467
媽媽    -寶貝

1595
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,469
媽媽    -我回來了

1596
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:26,304
親愛的

1597
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:29,474
我沒有錯過誰的生日吧

1598
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:30,642
沒有啦

1599
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:31,935
沒有，媽媽

1600
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:33,645
夫人，請坐

1601
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:35,147
謝謝你羅

1602
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,525
今天是我的生日嗎？

1603
01:35:38,692 --> 01:35:39,818
不是，媽媽

1604
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:42,487
你們都好漂亮

1605
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:47,868
媽媽，怎麼回事？

1606
01:35:50,996 --> 01:35:52,372
晚安，凱薩琳

1607
01:35:58,336 --> 01:35:59,629
你什麼都不打算說嗎？

1608
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,298
我不是主角

1609
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,301
你們也不說？

1610
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:09,139
好吧，我才不要整晚…

1611
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:13,518
我的老天

1612
01:36:14,186 --> 01:36:15,187
這是給我的

1613
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:20,692
你很傷心嗎，媽媽？    -沒有

1614
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:23,069
沒關係，媽媽    -他是好人

1615
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:24,988
我知道

1616
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,323
我只是忍不住

1617
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,241
他還沒問你喔

1618
01:36:29,326 --> 01:36:31,203
我知道，但他會的

1619
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,370
你會吧？

1620
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:33,705
如果你讓我開口的話

1621
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:36,041
快點，她都在哭了

1622
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,542
安靜

1623
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:38,668
這是我媽媽的戒指

1624
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,004
好美

1625
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,215
她和我父親結婚了…

1626
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:44,591
52年

1627
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:48,595
我想這是世界上最幸運的戒指了

1628
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,516
認識你那天，我打電話給我媽媽

1629
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:55,769
說：「媽，我找到結婚的對象了」

1630
01:36:55,936 --> 01:36:57,062
她說什麼？

1631
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:59,856
她說：「她一定很不平凡」

1632
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,066
那你說什麼？

1633
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:02,526
我說：「不」

1634
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:05,570
「她不只不平凡」

1635
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,280
「她勝過一切」

1636
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:09,115
現在…

1637
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:12,786
我打算更浪漫的，我很快會補償你

1638
01:37:12,953 --> 01:37:14,037
沒關係

1639
01:37:15,372 --> 01:37:17,082
但我知道娶了你…

1640
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,584
也包括娶了你的女孩們

1641
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,088
讚美上帝

1642
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:24,631
我願意

1643
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:26,800
我還沒問你

1644
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:28,093
快點

1645
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,430
我的天哪

1646
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,104
我的寶貝，你們看，很美是不是？

1647
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:41,231
你看，媽媽

1648
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:44,943
水星-擎天神太空船將使格倫…

1649
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,737
成為首位進入地球軌道的美國人

1650
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:51,074
目前已進行五次無人飛行測試

1651

1652
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:57,414
已確認本次任務的…

1653
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:59,791
發射與收回系統計算結果

1654
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:03,128
調整與裝置安裝都符合進度

1655
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:04,963
是，先生，就在這裡

1656
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:07,632
您找我，長官？

1657
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:08,800
坐下吧

1658
01:38:09,968 --> 01:38:11,636
有什麼問題嗎，哈里遜先生？

1659
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:13,346
不，沒有問題

1660
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:19,144
其實IBM計算的速度超過任何人類

1661
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:20,979
甚至比你還快

1662
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,148
那是好事啊

1663
01:38:26,026 --> 01:38:27,193
也許吧

1664
01:38:28,153 --> 01:38:29,654
卡納維爾角基地那邊堅持

1665
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:32,115
要在那裡進行所有後援準備

1666
01:38:33,325 --> 01:38:34,200
我懂

1667
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:36,369
所以這裡就不做後援了

1668
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:40,457
老實說，我們根本比不上IBM

1669
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:47,213
總之，這個部門不需要計算人員了

1670
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:50,717
進步是一把雙面刃

1671
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:58,350
你要回去西側計算組了

1672
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:00,852
我們會看看有沒有其它職位

1673
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:02,354
謝謝您，長官

1674
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:07,192
凱薩琳，我…

1675
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:10,987
覺得很遺憾

1676
01:39:12,072 --> 01:39:14,240
這超出我的職權，希望你瞭解

1677
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:16,826
我瞭解

1678
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,059
凱薩琳

1679
01:39:43,228 --> 01:39:44,938
我們聽說你訂婚了

1680
01:39:45,105 --> 01:39:46,106
是的

1681
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:48,024
你們真貼心

1682
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:56,866
好漂亮

1683
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:58,868
其實是哈里遜先生的主意

1684
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:02,414
但我想應該是他老婆挑的

1685
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:05,417
他眼裡除了數字應該沒別的了

1686
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,253
祝你婚禮順利

1687
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:11,047
你在這裡做得很好，凱薩琳

1688
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:42,912
你好，很高興見到你

1689
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,372
牧師，你好嗎？    -你好嗎？

1690
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:49,085
第一次我根本沒什麼感覺

1691
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,670
我太緊張了

1692
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:55,133
你跟那時候一樣美麗

1693
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,468
你覺得嗎？

1694
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,636
只是老了一點

1695
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:00,472
還有胖了一點

1696
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,849
但你很美

1697
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:09,147
我們來吧，又一次

1698
01:41:09,647 --> 01:41:10,565
水星計劃

1699
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:14,152
以羅馬神話中的雙翼信使為名

1700
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:16,154
三年兩個月又三天後的今天…

1701
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:17,322
「1962.2.20  約翰格倫升空」

1702
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:20,867
在十次失敗后，總算…    -好女孩

1703
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:22,911
我們再次嘗試把美國人送上軌道

1704
01:41:23,078 --> 01:41:25,205
讓約翰格倫上校進入軌道

1705
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:27,373
他會是首位進入地球軌道的美國人

1706
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:30,210
各位可以看到這裡有數千人

1707
01:41:30,376 --> 01:41:32,295
要見證這個歷史事件

1708
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:34,756
保羅，這邊有問題

1709
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:37,133
這些著陸座標跟昨天的不一樣

1710
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:40,804
是IBM跑出來的結果

1711
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,723
那IBM就是昨天出錯了

1712
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:45,475
對嗎？

1713
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:47,769
或是該死的在今天出錯了

1714
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:53,775
保羅，我說的對嗎？

1715
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:56,194
看起來是這樣

1716
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,364
「卡納維爾角基地」

1717
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:00,949
在這之前IBM都沒有問題

1718
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:03,159
但我們會重跑一次看看

1719
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,036
我要老實說，艾爾

1720
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,163
我當飛行員時，是我控制機器

1721
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,666
現在好像是機器控制我

1722
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:10,875
我們看法一致，約翰

1723
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:12,335
我們的人在處理了

1724
01:42:12,502 --> 01:42:14,295
去找那個女孩來驗算

1725
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,756
那個女孩？    -對，長官

1726
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:19,759
你是說凱薩琳？

1727
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:21,928
對，聰明的那個

1728
01:42:22,095 --> 01:42:24,556
如果她說數字沒問題，我就出發

1729
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,808
好，我們會去聯絡

1730
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:28,226
收到

1731
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:31,271
山姆

1732
01:42:32,188 --> 01:42:33,648
去找凱薩琳哥柏

1733
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:37,318
她要確認數字，否則我們飛不了

1734
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,653
是，長官

1735
01:43:02,468 --> 01:43:04,095
我要找凱薩琳哥柏

1736
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:05,430
我現在是凱薩琳強生

1737
01:43:05,597 --> 01:43:06,723
他們要你來確認座標數字

1738
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:10,852
觀光客數週前就蜂擁到可可亞海灘

1739
01:43:11,019 --> 01:43:14,689
佔領了卡納維爾角周邊和佛州

1740
01:43:14,856 --> 01:43:17,108
全國各地，彷彿時間…

1741
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:19,319
好，給她一點空間工作

1742
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:23,156
我們在等待格倫上校升空

1743
01:43:23,323 --> 01:43:25,283
這是美國曆史性的一日

1744
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:28,244
全國等待了好幾個月

1745
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:31,456
無人擎天神火箭測試失敗多次

1746
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:34,584
人類操縱計劃也取消過10次

1747
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:38,713
都是因為各種機械或系統問題

1748
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:39,714
就連天氣…

1749
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:42,675
最終測試與檢查已完成

1750
01:43:42,842 --> 01:43:45,595
約翰格倫準備登上友誼7號

1751
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:50,475
我們肯定今天是最適合起飛的日子

1752
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:52,185
座艙已經準備好

1753
01:43:52,352 --> 01:43:56,022
火箭一切正常，這裡的天氣…

1754
01:43:56,189 --> 01:43:58,399
朗里那邊有訊息嗎？    -還沒

1755
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:01,444
我們得知太空總署控制中心…

1756
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:05,114
正在最後確認發射與返航座標

1757
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:07,742
包括最後的返航關鍵點計算

1758
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,703
這是安全成功發射與返航的關鍵

1759
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:13,498
多年的等待，數月的延後

1760
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:16,668
格倫上校終於準備好這次太空飛行

1761
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:18,962
我們滿懷期望，等待已久

1762
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:22,840
最後確認可能暗示太空總署的遲疑

1763
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:24,342
但我們毫無保留地說

1764
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:28,471
約翰格倫上校的安全是首要條件

1765
01:44:28,972 --> 01:44:30,473
也是國家最重視的

1766
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,808
不，長官，我們還是會飛

1767
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:33,518
是，長官

1768
01:44:37,438 --> 01:44:38,273
就是這樣

1769
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,779
你搞什麼？居然在休息？

1770
01:44:59,669 --> 01:45:02,380
「州立警局」

1771
01:45:05,258 --> 01:45:09,095
「太空總署」

1772
01:45:32,452 --> 01:45:33,870
現在幾點？

1773
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:06,444
長官

1774
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,033
14號發射臺

1775
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,004
凱薩琳

1776
01:46:30,343 --> 01:46:31,344
快點

1777
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:36,891
長官，14號發射臺連線

1778
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:38,643
好，讓我跟他們說

1779
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:44,607
這裡是朗里，座標已確認

1780
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:45,900
待命，朗里

1781
01:46:48,694 --> 01:46:49,695
我們可以確定

1782
01:46:49,862 --> 01:46:52,698
重返大氣層的關鍵位置

1783
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:58,246
是緯度16.11984

1784
01:46:58,413 --> 01:47:04,001
經度-165.2356

1785
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:06,963
發射時機確認

1786
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,090
著陸座標正確

1787
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:10,883
這是很好的訊息，艾爾

1788
01:47:11,676 --> 01:47:14,095
要信任看不到的東西有點困難

1789
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:15,805
沒錯，上校

1790
01:47:15,972 --> 01:47:17,682
凱薩琳算出來的…

1791
01:47:17,849 --> 01:47:19,934
還比那個大機器多幾個小數點

1792
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:23,771
我會參照你的每個數字，幫我謝謝她

1793
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:26,149
各位，火箭準備發射

1794
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:27,650
祝你好運，友誼7號

1795
01:47:27,817 --> 01:47:29,235
一路順風，朗里

1796
01:47:32,572 --> 01:47:33,948
這裡是卡納維爾角

1797
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:35,700
繼續升空倒數…

1798
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:37,410
約翰格倫上校

1799
01:47:37,577 --> 01:47:39,203
登上友誼7號

1800
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:41,706
位在14號發射臺的擎天神火箭

1801
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:44,417
高23公尺

1802
01:47:44,584 --> 01:47:45,585
目前倒數計時…

1803
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:48,212
這些是佛州卡納維爾角的畫面

1804
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:50,423
發射臺往後退了

1805
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:52,341
我們準備升空

1806
01:47:52,508 --> 01:47:55,094
水星號脫離燃料供應纜

1807
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:58,014
倒數10秒開始

1808
01:47:58,181 --> 01:48:00,391
供水開始，水星號準備    -8、7

1809
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:02,393
6、5    -引擎啟動

1810
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,519
4

1811
01:48:03,686 --> 01:48:05,855
3、2    -老天，一路順風

1812
01:48:06,022 --> 01:48:08,107
1、0

1813
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:09,484
點火

1814
01:48:10,485 --> 01:48:11,736
升空

1815
01:48:15,907 --> 01:48:18,034
水星擎天神6號升空了

1816
01:48:20,953 --> 01:48:22,413
這裡有點顛簸啊

1817
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:23,414
收到

1818
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:24,749
現在是最大動壓

1819
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:26,417
收到，座艙指揮中心

1820
01:48:26,584 --> 01:48:28,419
所有系統都在運作

1821
01:48:28,586 --> 01:48:30,087
第二引擎關閉還有20秒

1822
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:32,131
軌道依舊完美

1823
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:33,382
第二引擎關閉

1824
01:48:34,342 --> 01:48:37,053
收到，第二引擎關閉

1825
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:44,101
零重力，我感覺很好

1826
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:47,021
約翰格倫回報一切都好

1827
01:48:48,189 --> 01:48:50,399
這個景象太驚人了

1828
01:48:51,943 --> 01:48:53,903
收到，友誼7號

1829
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,660
你可以進入軌道了

1830
01:49:00,826 --> 01:49:02,370
謝謝，座艙指揮中心

1831
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,669
好，還有十個半小時

1832
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:11,379
如果成功繞七次的話

1833
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:14,048
我要咖啡

1834
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:19,554
東岸時間接近午夜

1835
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:22,473
格倫上校開始第三趟繞行

1836
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,142
跨越四分之三的非洲大陸

1837
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:26,936
在東非尚吉巴上空可以看到…

1838
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:29,605
他將抵達的下一個追蹤站

1839
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:31,857
感謝老天，友誼7號座艙…

1840
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,243
新任務來了

1841
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,999
這裡總是在改變

1842
01:49:48,165 --> 01:49:50,042
很難跟上他們

1843
01:49:50,209 --> 01:49:52,545
「太空總署IBM計算中心主管」

1844
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:56,007
他們要一個長期小組負責操作IBM

1845
01:49:56,173 --> 01:49:57,550
多少人？

1846
01:49:57,717 --> 01:49:59,677
初期要30人

1847
01:50:02,388 --> 01:50:05,141
謝謝你的訊息，米契爾女士

1848
01:50:06,309 --> 01:50:09,228
不客氣，范恩女士

1849

「有色計算人員」

1850
01:50:52,438 --> 01:50:54,065
「熱擋板」

1851
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:55,733
這裡出現警告燈號

1852
01:50:56,317 --> 01:50:58,277
座艙指揮中心7號，有警告燈號

1853
01:50:58,444 --> 01:50:59,612
待命，7號

1854
01:51:00,321 --> 01:51:02,198
長官，出現警告燈號

1855
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:07,244
什麼情況，保羅？

1856
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:10,498
熱擋板可能鬆了

1857
01:51:10,665 --> 01:51:13,876
7號，請確認著陸氣囊是關的嗎？

1858
01:51:14,919 --> 01:51:16,379
確定，座艙指揮中心

1859
01:51:16,545 --> 01:51:17,838
艾爾，他現在就得回來

1860
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:19,757
否則他重返大氣層時會被燒燬

1861
01:51:28,683 --> 01:51:29,475
「祝約翰格倫與友誼7號好運」

過來，寶貝

1863
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:31,811
太空里有個人

1864
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:33,396
我們不想錯過，所以要快

1865
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:35,189
格倫出事了

1866
01:51:35,356 --> 01:51:36,649
怎麼回事？    -好，過來

1867
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:38,984
快點    -你們跟著我

1868
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:40,152
「布萊蕭電器」

1869
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:42,613
我們剛剛得知友誼7號…

1870
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:45,700
熱擋板有脫落的危險

1871
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:47,952
你有聽到敲擊的聲音嗎？

1872
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:49,704
或是比較頻繁的這種聲音？

1873
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:51,288
沒有，座艙指揮中心

1874
01:51:51,455 --> 01:51:53,249
這使得任務面臨極大危險

1875
01:51:53,416 --> 01:51:55,126
叫他們不要拋出回航裝置

1876
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:57,169
叫他們不要拋出回航裝置

1877
01:51:57,670 --> 01:52:01,048
太空總署確認座艙熱擋板有問題

1878
01:52:01,215 --> 01:52:03,592
可能會脫落

1879
01:52:03,759 --> 01:52:05,678
如果熱擋板鬆脫

1880
01:52:05,845 --> 01:52:09,181
回航裝置的綁繩也許能固定擋板

1881
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:10,433
這樣有用嗎？

1882
01:52:10,599 --> 01:52:12,226
會有用的

1883
01:52:12,393 --> 01:52:14,979
直到他到達返航位置

1884
01:52:15,146 --> 01:52:16,105
可以撐到那時候

1885
01:52:16,272 --> 01:52:20,317
艾爾，他必須手動進入大氣層

1886
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:21,485
就這麼辦

1887
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:22,987
友誼7號

1888
01:52:23,154 --> 01:52:25,990
我們建議你不要拋出…

1889
01:52:26,157 --> 01:52:28,242
回航裝置，重複，不要拋出

1890
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:32,246
所以你必須手動操縱重返大氣層

1891
01:52:32,413 --> 01:52:33,414
收到

1892
01:52:33,581 --> 01:52:35,958
有原因嗎？結束

1893
01:52:36,125 --> 01:52:37,126
請待命，7號

1894
01:52:42,423 --> 01:52:43,674
目前沒有，7號

1895
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:49,096
收到，指揮中心，我會手動操縱

1896
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:51,640
收回潛望鏡，結束

1897
01:52:55,227 --> 01:52:56,437
他知道了

1898
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:05,696
如果沒有熱擋板

1899
01:53:05,863 --> 01:53:08,824
格倫上校不可能通過地球大氣層

1900
01:53:08,991 --> 01:53:10,659
因為溫度太高了

1901
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,537
自動控制系統失靈

1902
01:53:13,704 --> 01:53:16,916
造成太空船傾斜飄移

1903
01:53:17,082 --> 01:53:21,128
使友誼7號通過大氣層時有危險

1904
01:53:21,295 --> 01:53:24,673
此刻格倫正朝著美國俯衝

1905
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:29,220
他要在加州以西483公里開始返航

1906
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:32,348
才能在預定的回收區著陸

1907
01:53:32,515 --> 01:53:37,311
降落在佛州東南1,127公里處

1908
01:53:37,478 --> 01:53:40,105
鎖定本臺瞭解更多詳細報導

1909
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:43,567
你要用電傳飛操系統重返大氣層

1910
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:46,403
必須維持零角度，結束

1911
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:48,697
收到，切換到電傳飛操

1912
01:53:48,864 --> 01:53:50,866
手動操縱是備案，結束

1913
01:53:51,033 --> 01:53:52,201
繼續和他說話

1914
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:53,369
收到

1915
01:53:53,536 --> 01:53:55,830
回收區的天氣

1916
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:58,332
浪高0.9公尺，能見度16.1公里

1917
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:00,835
座艙指揮中心，我聽不清楚

1918
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,920
他正經過通訊中斷區

1919
01:54:05,965 --> 01:54:08,467
外面有個真正的火球，裡面好熱

1920
01:54:22,147 --> 01:54:23,482
座艙指揮中心，聽見了嗎？

1921
01:54:52,595 --> 01:54:55,055
友誼7號，聽得見嗎？結束

1922
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:00,227
再一次

1923
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:02,396
友誼7號，聽得見嗎？結束

1924
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:19,204
友誼7號，聽得見嗎？結束

1925
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:33,928
非常清楚，座艙指揮中心

1926
01:55:34,803 --> 01:55:37,097
收到，你還好嗎？

1927
01:55:38,641 --> 01:55:41,352
我很好，剛剛真的有顆火球啊

1928
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:42,436

讓我們帶你回家吧

1930

1931
01:55:45,356 --> 01:55:47,566
希望著陸點沒有變

1932
01:55:47,733 --> 01:55:50,486

接近-165.2356

1936

1939
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:07,252
情況如何，座艙指揮中心？

1940
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:09,338
你完全吻合返航點計算結果

Ms. Coleman...

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,723
why don't you solve the equation on the board?

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,204
MS. SUMNER: We took up a collection

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,691
amongst the teachers and such.

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,841
It's not a lot...

27

That's more than kind, Ms. Sumner.

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,645
YOUNG KATHERINE: If the product of two terms

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,882
is zero then common sense says

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,129
at least one of the two terms has to be zero to start with.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,204
So if you move all the terms over to one side,

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,402
you can put the quadratics into a form

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,720
that can be factored...

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,484
allowing that side of the equation

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,561
to equal zero.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,805
Once you've done that, it's pretty straightforward

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,881
from there.

And then, a 1.6 megaton RDS-37 thermonuclear warhead...

168

drops down in the middle of Des Moines.

Just that... Who the hell is he?

Paul Stafford, our lead engineer, Mr. Webb.

173
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,686
I think what he meant to say...

174
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,167
is that speculation, at least on our side of the equation...

175
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,322
by definition can be...

176
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,130
just a little dangerous.

00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,327
Dangerous?

178
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,960
You know what's dangerous, Mr. Stafford?

179

Get us up there, Harrison.

187

We can't justify a space program

188

Hmm?

193
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,882
No, he didn't look enlightened to me.

Not particularly.

he's not wrong about what he said in there.

You know that, right?

199

Because now that they can get up there,

200
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,681

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,209
Let me ask you...

325
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,805
if you were a white male,

326
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,405
would you wish to be an engineer?

327
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,968
I wouldn't have to. I'd already be one.

328
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,363

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,927
No jewelry.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,128
A simple pearl necklace is the exception.

332
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,045
Your supervisor is Mr. Al Harrison,

333
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,362
Director of the Space Task Group.

334
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,803
You'll write research, proof calculations, so forth.

335

Do not talk to Mr. Harrison unless he talks to you.

He's been through a dozen in as many months.

338
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,246
Come on, keep up.

339

Take the desk in the back. I'll get you work in a bit.

352
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,049
Mr. Harrison won't warm up to you. Don't expect it.

353
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,486
Do your work, keep your head down.

354
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,281
Thank you.

355
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,524

Why are we still losing shingles

off the heat shield?

359
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,087
We're working with a prototype of the capsule, Al.

360
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,924
Its lid is one third the size of what it's going...

361
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,081
AL: I get that.

362
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,684
So, what do we do with our million dollar fan, Karl?

363
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,121
Turn it down? No, Al. I don't think...

364
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,681
It was a joke.

365
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,929
Paul, if the heat shield comes off...

366
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,684
what do you think happensto our astronaut?

367
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,841
I know.

368
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,004
So we're gonna come up with a solve, right?

369
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,207
Yes, sir. We're working on it.

370
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,689
Ruth, what's the status on that computer?

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,842
She's right behind you, Mr. Harrison.

372
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,361
Does she handle Analytic Geometry?

373
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,410
Absolutely. And she speaks.

374
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,800
Yes, sir. I do.

375
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,570
Which one? Both.

376
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,210

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,448

You think you can find me the Frenet frame

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,491
I prefer it over Euclidean coordinates.

384
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,051
Okay, good.

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,009
Good, then I'm gonna needitbythe end of the day.

386
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,286
Yes.

387
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,601
I'm also gonna ask you

388
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,761
to check Mr. Stafford's math

389
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,285
<i>as</i> well as others' on this floor

390
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,441
from time to time.

391
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,601
I can handle that, Al.

392
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,649
I'm sure you can, Paul. I'm sure they all can.

393
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,290
But if that were the case

394
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,885
shingles wouldn't be flying off the heat shield,

395
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,001
now would they?

396
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,889
Excuse me, could I have everyone's attention

397
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,041
for a moment?

398
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,650
Thank you.

399
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,811
Just to be clear...

400
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,850
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven will be here for training.

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,844
And I have no doubt in my mind that they're going to be

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,843
asking us questions about our work.

403
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,131
I think that's pretty reasonable

404
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,248
given we're putting a human on top of a missile,

405

406

(ALL LAUGH)

408
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,761
Because it's never been done,

409
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,321
everything we do between now and then is gonna matter.

410
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,564
It's gonna matter to their wives...

411
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,285
to their children.

412
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,928
I believe it's gonna matter to the whole damn country.

413
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,121

No, sir.

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,283
Good. So let's have an amen, damn it.

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,481
in North Carolina.

657
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,641
That's right. Yes, sir.

658
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,604
PASTOR AYRES: His faith in us has no limit.

659
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,608
The good Lord has our very own women

660
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,410
working on rocket ships.

661
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,125
(ALL APPLAU D)

662
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,609
And we have National Guardsmen

663
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,961
defending our freedom.

664
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,407
Give a shout of praise for Colonel Jim Johnson.

665
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,925
(ALL APPLAU D)

666
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,083
Returning home, by the grace of God

667
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,607
to set up a National Guard unit

668
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,246
right here in Hampton.

669
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,685
Can I get a hallelujah in here?

670
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,842
Hallelujah!

671
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,491
I just don't understand.

672
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,645
I don't understand it.

673
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,290
I don't wanna talk about this again, okay?

674
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,205
A female engineer?

675
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,361
A female engineer?

676
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,046
We're Negro, baby.

677
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,451
Ain't no such thing. Understand it.

678
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,965
It's not like that there, Levi.

679
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,451
You can't apply for freedom.

680
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,331
Freedom is never granted to the oppressed.

681
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,005
It's got to be demanded. Taken.

682
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,003
Stop quoting your slogans at me.

683
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,807
There is more than one way to achieve something.

684
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,927
I don't want any greens.

685
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,968
Hey. I tell you about interrupting?

686
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,804
Here. Try this, baby.

687
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,881
Yes.

688
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,769
You're gonna eat them greens, too.

689
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,808
Kids need to eat their vegetables.

690
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,689
You'd know that if you was ever home.

691
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,963
You better settle down, LeviJackson.

692
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,804
Unless you want this female's mind,

693
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,882
right here, in front of everybody.

694
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,405
All I'm saying...

695
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,324
don't play the fool.

696
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,323
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

697
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,403
NASA's never ever given you guys your due.

698
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,925
Having a couple of extra degrees

699
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,161
ain't gonna change that.

700
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,842
Civil rights ain't always civil.

701
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,164
I don't want any greens either.

702
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,367
No lip, little miss.

703
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,005
Your brother gets them, and so do you.

704
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,407
I hear he's planning on staying in the area.

705
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,763
Oh, yeah? Well, that's good for him.

706
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,400
Katherine, go find your way over there.

707
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,609
That Colonel Jim is a tall glass of water.

708
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,046
That he is.

709
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,766
Tall, strong, commanding.

710
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,207
And I bet he's like that day and night.

711
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,966
(CHUCKLES) Mary, it's Sunday.

712
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,451
Please have some shame.

713
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,886
I will not.

714
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,080
Hmm, I think he's smiling over here.

715
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,446
At you.

716
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,120
Well I'm not smiling back.

717
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,247
Yes, you are. Oh, child.

718
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,163
You are all teeth right now.  I am not.

719
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
(MOUTHING) Come over here.

720
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,041
DOROTHY: He's coming over.

721
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,440
KATHERINE: Now, why would he be doing that?

722
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,204
'Cause Mary's waving at him. KATHERINE: No!

723
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,970
Ladies, I'm not ready.  It's too late. Fix your hair.

724
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,121
Hello, Colonel.

725
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,406
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

726
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,562
That's Mary Jackson. I believe you met her husband,LevL

727
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,245
Yes, ma'am. Good to meet y'all.

728
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,765
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

729
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,729
She's not married. She's a widow...

730
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,087
...with three beautiful little girls.

731
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,241
So well behaved.

732
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,562
Angels on earth is what we like to call them.

733
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,404
Dorothy, slice of pie?

734
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,085
I'd love one.

735
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,730
Excuse me.

736
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,001
You already have a slice of pie...

737
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,081
Uh-huh.

738
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,411
I was just, uh, fixing my three babies some plates...

739
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,806
Let me help you.

740
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,000
Sure.

741
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,162
Fruit salad. Mmm-hmm.

742
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,530
Pastor mentioned  you're a computer at NASA.

743
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,567
Yes.

744
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,005
What's that entail?

745
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,601
Oh.

746
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,922
We calculate the mathematics necessary

747
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,651
to enable launch and landing for the space program.

748
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,321
(LAUG H I NG) That's pretty heady stuff.

749
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,527
Yes, it is.

750
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,409
They let women handle that sort of...

751
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,481
Uh...

752
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,001
That's not what I mean.

753
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,491
What do you mean?

754
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,603
I'm just surprised that something so...

755
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,726
taxing... Mmm-hmm.

756
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,325
Mr. Johnson.

757
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,647
If I were you, I'd quit talking right now.

758
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,040
I didn't mean no disrespect.

759
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,566
I will have you know

760
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,802
I was the first Negro female student

761
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,167
at West Virginia University Graduate School.

762
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,120
On any given day...

763
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,402
I analyze the manometer levels

764
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,960
for air displacement, friction, and velocity

765
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,606
and compute over 10,000 calculations

766
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,409
by cosine, square root...

767
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,608
and, lately, analytic geometry.

768
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,681
By hand.

769
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,771
There are 20 bright, highly capable

770
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,689
Negro women in the West Computing Group.

771
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,326
And we're proud to be doing our part for the country.

772
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,161
So, yes.

773
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,721
They let women do some things at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

774
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,687
And it's not because we wear skirts.

775
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,242
It's because we wear glasses.

776
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,890
Have a good day.

777
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,602
(BAND PLAYING) (ALL APPLAUDING)

778
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,206
Scott, welcome to Langley.

779
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,686
Welcome to Langley. Welcome.

780
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,204
Good to have you here, gentlemen.

781
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,566
Thank you.

782
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,411
That's Alan Shepard, U.S. Navy pilot.

783
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,403
He could be the first man in space.

784
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,251
And that's Scott Carpenter and Walter Schirra...

785
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,970
also Navy pilots.

786
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,885
All under 5' 11", 180 pounds.

787
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,644
|Qs over 130. Mmm.

788
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,723
And handsome must be a requirement too.

789
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,611
How could you possibly be ogling these white men?

790
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,761
It's equal rights.

791
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,882
I have the right to see fine in every color.

792
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,202
And that's John Glenn. He's the only Marine Corps pilot.

793
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,888
Gentlemen, if we may, much to see around here.

794
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,809
VVeH,heck, we haven't shaken all the hands yet.

795
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,570
We have a fairly tight itinerary, Colonel.

796
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,721
Ruth, he's fine.

797
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,081
He's coming this way. Look straight ahead.

798
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,241
I'm looking right at him.

799
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,404
Ladies, I didn't wanna run off without saying hello.

800
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,085
Seem to be in a big rush around here.

801
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,163
The Russians certainly aren't slowing down any.

802
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,924
They can't build a damn refrigerator.

803
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,126
How the heck did they beat us into space?

804
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,811
(ALL LAUGHING)

805
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,081
And what do you ladies do for NASA?

806
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,811
Calculate your trajectories. Launch and landing.

807
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,921
You can't get anywhere without the numbers.

808
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,001
No, sir.

809
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,968
Mary Jackson, Mr. Glenn. Engineering.

810
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,451
And I'm proud as the devil to be working with you.

811
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,761
Thank you, Mary.

812
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,841
John.

813
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,770
John, let's take it inside. Yes, sir.

814
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,570
Guys. Nice meeting you guys.

815
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,126
Thank you, Colonel. Good luck, sir.

816
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,611
God bless you all.

817
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,806
Thank you. That's wonderful.

818
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,601
Thank you!

819
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,531
Mr. Harrison wants you to confirm

820
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,331
launch and landing for the Redstone rocket test.

821
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,563
I cannot work on what I cannot see, Mr. Stafford.

822
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,801
It's illegible.

823
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,604
Those numbers have already been confirmed

824
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,569
by two engineers in this department and myself.

825
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,768
This is more or less a dummy check.

826
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,249
You have one, we make it two. Make it double, okay?

827
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,209
We gotta get it. Just make it happen.

828
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,247
No one thought to measure these things?

829
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,050
I'm afraid not, sir.

830
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,568
Well, would you like us to stop?

831
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,722
No. No, just...

832
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,806
Actually, no. Just keep going.

833
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,451
In fact, use the big hammer.

834
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,601
Yes, sir.

835
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,722
Come on, use the big hammer. You heard the man. Let's go.

836
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,881
Watch out.

837
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,921
Ma'am.

838
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,521
Our runner can pick up your work, Dorothy.

839
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,164
You need to be working, not walking.

840
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,608
Oh, it's break time, ma'am. No trouble at all.

841
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,444
Since you made the trip...

842
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,728
you can take that batch over there.

843
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,289
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

844
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,487
You need something else? Yes, ma'am.

845
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,890
I was wondering if you know what they're building

846
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,001
over in the tech wing.

847
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,962
It's called an IBM.

848
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,610
A mainframe machine.

849
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,845
Apparently, it can do our calculations

850
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,961
in a fraction of the time.

851
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,681
Hmm.

852
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,964
I guess that's good for NASA.

853
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,488
Hurry on, now. Best if you do it in one trip.

854
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,841
(GRUNTS)

855
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,241
Excuse me.

856
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,441
Hi.

857
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,764
What are you looking at, Paul?

858
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,525
ls that correct?

859
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,961
Yeah.

860
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,807
Whose work is that?

861
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,883
I said, whose work is that?

862
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,484
Katherine Goble, sir.

863
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,327
Hello. Hi.

864
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,401
PAUL: How did you know the Redstone

865
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,050
couldn't support orbital flight?

866
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,247
That's classified information.

867
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,401
It's top secret.

868
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,247
It's no secret why the Redstone tests keep failing.

869
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,890
It's fine for sub-orbital flight

870
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,088
but it can't handle the weight of the capsule

871
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,241
and push it into space.

872
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,405
Numbers don't lie.

873
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,322
And you figured all that out with this?

874
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,923
Half the data is redacted.

875
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,168
But what's there tells a story if you read between the lines.

876
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,004
The distance from launch to orbit, we know.

877
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,366
Redstone mass, we know.

878
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,408
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

879
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,410
And the speeds are there in the data.

880
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,250
You did the math.

881
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,641
Yes, sir.

882
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,283
I looked beyond.

883
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,761
How do you know about the Atlas rocket?

884
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,762
That's not math.

885
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,001
That data is not here.

886
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,804
Like you said, it's classified.

887
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,769
I held it up to the light.

888
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,291
You held it up to the light?

889
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,521
Yes, sir.

890
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,801
Well, there it is.

891
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,961
Mmm-hmm.

892
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,281
Atlas.

893
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,281
What's your name?

894
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,965
Katherine Goble.

895
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,645
Are you a spy, Katherine?

896
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,767
Am I what?

897
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,001
I said, are you a Russian spy?

898
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,485
No, sir.

899
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,005
I'm not Russian.

900
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,170
She's not Russian, sir.

901
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,803
All right then, we have nothing to lose here.

902
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,961
Give her everything she needs

903
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,166
to work on Shepard's trajectories.

904
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,402
Without redaction. Are we clear on that?

905
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,846
Are we sure about this?

906
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,041
What's the issue, Paul?

907
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,645
You heard her.

908
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,801
She's not a spy.

909
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,244
I just don't think it's a good idea.

910
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,086
You know what I think's a good idea? Darker ink.

911
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,480
I think darker ink's a good idea.

912
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,687
Ruth, could you pass it along?

913
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,761
Yes, sir.

914
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,001
Thank you, Katherine.

915
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,321

This IBM's gonna put us all out of work.

924

How you doing? What can we do about it?

925
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,282
Only one thing to do.

926
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,169
Learn all we can, make ourselves valuable.

is gonna have to push the buttons.

That position is available to any qualified applicant.

Right. Except, you don't have the educational requirements.

1114
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,490
I've been asking myself all the way over here...

1115
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,727
which is...

1116
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,090
How the hell did we find ourself

1117
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,089
in second place in a two-man race?

1118
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,881
Anybody?

1119
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,881
Paul?

1120
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,845
And I think Glenn said it pretty well.

1121
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,041
They're just outworking us.

1122
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,441
The reason I have to think that

1123
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,647
is because I refuse to believe

1124
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,290
that the Russians are smarter than us

1125
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,965
or that they have more technology,

1126
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,565
or that they care more.

1127
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,123
But I don't know. ls that possible?

1128
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,646
ls it possible that it actually

1129
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,245
means more to them?

1130
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,923
We're in the fight of our lives, people.

1131
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,401
We're not on some epicjoy ride.

1132
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,244
I just saw seven faces

1133
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,403
who aren't sure that we can get there.

1134
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,729
This is our problem.

1135
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,085
And so as of right now

1136
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,929
there's only two things you need to know going forward.

1137
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,605
One is staying here, working late,

1138
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,926
that's gonna be a fact of life.

1139
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,610
And two, don't expect your paychecks

1140
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,085
to reflect the extra time it's gonna take

1141
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,248
to catch up and pass those bastards.

1142
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,605
For those of you who can't work that way,

1143
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,127
I understand and thank you for what you've done.

1144
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,770
For everyone else...

1145
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,007
lsuggest you call your wives

1146
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,571
and tell them how it's gonna be.

1147
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,490
I'll start with mine.

1319

to the Moon and to the planets beyond.

1320

Yes! We did it!

1321
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,688
And we have vowed...

1322
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,207
that we shall not see it governed...

We set sail on this new sea...

1326
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,328
because there is new knowledge to be gained...

not because they are easy...

1331

Yes, Your Honor. I'm aware of that.

I believe there are special circumstances

Your Honor...

1394
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,409

01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,767
no Negro woman in the state of Virginia...

1409
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,281
has ever attended an all-white high school.

1410
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,441
It's unheard of.

1411

Yeah. Unheard of.

1412
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,571
And before Alan Shepard sat on top of a rocket,

1413
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,842
no other American had ever touched space.

1414
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,328
And now, he will forever be remembered

1415
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,921
as the U.S. Navy man from New Hampshire,

1416
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,128
the first to touch the stars.

1417

Mr. Harrison...

1444
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,330
I was wondering.

1445
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,289
Uh-huh. I've been wondering my whole life,

1446
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,010
so you just spit it out.

1447
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,083
Well, sir...

1448
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,562
I would like to get a jump on John Glenn's trajectory.

1449
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,721
This isn't about plugging in numbers,

1450
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,006
it's about inventing the math.

1451
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,810
And I think you and I talked about that, right?

1452
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,881
It doesn't exist.

1453
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,041
I can do it, sir.

1454

Do you have any idea how exacting

1455
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,245
these calculations have to be?

1456
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,841
It's like shooting a sawed-off shotgun from a thousand feet

1457
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,645
and getting that one BB through a hole so tiny, you can't even see it.

1458
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,687
Okay, let me see what you've got.

1459
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,841
I'm an excellent shot, sir.

1460

How have the Grissom numbers been?

1461
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,570
They've been spot on.

1462
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,480
Give Glenn's orbit a go.

1463

01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,366
Rescuers are now going to pull him

1478
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,441
from the ocean waves.

1479
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,685
Unfortunately, the Liberty Bell 7 capsule is lost.

1480
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,881
Mama.

1481
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,801
I can't, I can't. Mary.

1482
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,081
SENATOR PATRICK: Mr. Harrison,

1483
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,321
taxpayer money sank into the ocean

1484
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,806
along with your capsule.

1485
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,961
So what makes you think

1486
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,849
you can bring John Glenn home safely?

1487
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,001
Let me say first...

1488
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,445
discovery is never just for the sake

1489
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,521
of discovery, gentlemen...

1490
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,762
but for the sake of human survival.

1491
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,647
And it will always come with a risk.

1492
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,322
Whoever gets there first will make the rules.

1493
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,482
That's been true of every civilization.

1494
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,651
And so, I think the bigger question

1495
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,250
for this body to consider is...

1496
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,007
who do you want calling the shots in space?

1497
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,643
We have to know what's out there, Senator.

1498
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,891
We have to touch the stars,

1499
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,281
if only to ensure our own survival.

1500
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,283
And only a man can do that.

1501
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,571
We'll get John Glenn home safely

1502
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,130
because we have to.

1503
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,327
Because he has to tell us what he saw.

1504
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,882
The Redstone rocket went straight up.

1505
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,324
But the capsule didn't have enough speed

1506
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,731
to go into orbit, so it came back down.

1507
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,122
Essentially a triangle. Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1508
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,884
That math was known.

1509
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,560
That took Shepard, took Grissom.

1510
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,925
That cannot take Glenn.

1511
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,484
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1512
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,089
that can push us into orbit.

1513
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,369
Goes up, delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit.

1514
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,969
Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it

1515
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,771
but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.

1516
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,684
That's how it stays in orbit.

1517
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,127
Now, getting it back down...

1518
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,564
that's the math we don't know.

1519
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,641
Yes, Katherine.

1520
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,485
So the capsule will spin around the Earth forever

1521
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,563
because there's nothing to slow it down?

1522
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,281
That's right.

1523
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,410
Slowing it down at precisely the right moment,

1524
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,164
at precisely the right amount,

1525
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,321
that's the task.

1526
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,481
Yes, Katherine.

1527
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,087
So it needs to move from an elliptical orbit...

1528
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,682
to a parabolic orbit.

1529
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,881
Yes.

1530
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,722
That's the "Go/No-go."

1531
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,848
Now at this point, it's a pin head.

1532
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,005
We bring him in too soon...

1533
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,810
He burns up on reentry.

1534
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,200
That's right.

1535
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,691
We bring him in too late...

1536
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,444
he's pushed out of Earth's gravity.

1537
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,922
And any changes to mass, weight, speed, time...

1538
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,448
distance, friction, or a puff of wind...

1539
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,408
would alter the "Go/No-go."

1540
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,530
And we start our calculations over.

1541
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,921
Yes.

1542
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,447
So we need to be able to choose this reentry point.

1543
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,604
Now this "Go/No-go," this has to be exact.

1544
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,807
Sam.

1545
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,568
These are the latest Redstone numbers

1546
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,971
in current capsule data.

1547
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,690
Obviously, we know the launch spot.

1548
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,761
Thanks.

1549
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,604
A Pentagon briefing should illuminate

1550
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,409
where the Navy needs the recovery zone.

1551
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,443
Then we work backwards from there.

1552
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,727
And the rest is on us, so let's get to work.

1553
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,441
Uh, Mr. Stafford.

1554
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,727
What, Katherine?

1555
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,165
If I could attend the briefings,

1556
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,402
I'd be more useful to the project.

1557
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,403
Pentagon briefings are closed door.

1558
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,404
Yes, but if we don't have the information

1559
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,811
of the changes...

1560
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,961
we can't keep up.

1561
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,400
I need those changes as they occur.

1562
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,606
As you said, it's a pin head.

1563
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,524
Katherine, that's the job.

1564
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,250
You asked for this assignment,

1565
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,402
so just calculate with what you have.

1566
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,528
Or we'll find someone who can.

1567
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,287
Okay-

1568
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,929
Attagirl. (CHUCKLES)

1569
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,602
What the hell are you doing? You can't be in here.

1570
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,807
Who are you?

1571
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,883
I'm with the West Computing Group.

1572
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,360
Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1573
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,249
This is a very delicate piece of equipment.

1574
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,050
I'm sorry, sir. I'm just trying to be helpful.

1575
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,441
BILL: Uh-huh. Bill, we've got numbers.

1576
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,530
What kind of numbers?

1577
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,005
Well, I'll be.

1578
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,161
What's your name again?

1579
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,286
Dorothy Vaughan.

1580
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,925
Dorothy Vaughan.

1581
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,646
Sir, the parameters for Friendship 7.

1582
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,405
Oh, this is all moot.

1583
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,403
We're altering the window on the capsule.

1584
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,050
When did this happen? Six minutes ago.

1585
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,651
The math is changing. Start over.

1586
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,088
Sir, if I could attend the briefings, I could stay current...

1587
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,730
Katherine, we have been through this.

1588
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,881
It is not possible.

1589
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,565
There is no protocol for women attending.

1590
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,801
There's no protocol for a man

1591
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,046
circling the Earth either, sir.

1592
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,851
Okay. That is just the way things are.

1593
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,605
Colonel Glenn's launch coordinates,

1594
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,125
accounting for the window change, sir.

1595
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,520
I have told you this.

1596
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,090
Computers don't author reports. Fix it.

1597
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,368
Those are my calculations. My name should be on it.

1598
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,443
That is not the way this works.

1599
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,967
Paul. What's happening here?

1600
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,282
Mr. Harrison, I would like to attend today's briefing.

1601
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,521
And why is that?

1602
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,371
Sir, the data changes so fast. The capsule changes.

1603
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,971
The weight and the landing zones

1604
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,565
are all changing, every day.

1605
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,961
I do my work, you attend these briefings,

1606
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,041
I have to start over.

1607
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,523
Colonel Glenn launches in a few weeks.

1608
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,320
We don't have the math figured out yet.

1609
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,090
Why is it she can't attend?

1610
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,327
Because she doesn't have clearance, Al.

1611
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,925
lcannotdo my work effectively

1612
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,326
if I do not have all of the data

1613
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,647
and all of the information as soon as it's available.

1614
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,325
I need to be in that room, hearing what you hear.

1615
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,164
Pentagon briefings are not for civilians.

1616
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,366
It requires the highest clearance.

1617
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,407
lfeelhke I'm the best person

1618
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,606
to present my calculations...

1619
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,643
You're not gonna let this go, are you?  No, lam not.

1620
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,728
And she is a woman. There is no protocol

1621
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,841
for a woman attending these meetings.

1622
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,291
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1623
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,845
But within these walls,

1624
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,330
who makes the rules?

1625
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,005
You, sir. You are the boss.

1626
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,811
You just have to act like one. Sir.

1627
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,321
You keep quiet.

1628
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,281
Thank you.

1629
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,281
Good morning.

1630
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,440

This is Katherine Goble

1634
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,887
with our Trajectory and Launch Window division.

1635
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,207
Her work is pertinent to today's proceedings.

1636
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,441
Come on.

1637
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,886
Wanna get her a chair?

1638

Let's discuss a landing zone.

1643
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,681
The Navy needs a singular landing zone.

1644

20 miles square is what we can service for retrieval.

Outside of that

1646
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,209
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1647
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,647
We'd like three possible recovery areas.

1661

1662
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,726
is the Bahamas.

1663
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,609

Yeah, in theory, sir.

1665

We need to be past theory at this point.

1666

01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,521
Okay-

1805
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,441
Huh.

1806

(DOOR OPENS)

1807
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,846
Dorothy.

1808
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,051
Mrs. Mitchell.

1809
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,203
You're working late today.

1810
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:02,527
Seems to always happen that way.

1811
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,682
Yes. Seems to.

1812

(VIVIAN CLEARS TH ROAT)

1813
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,521
Thank you.

1814
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,405
I hear the IBM's up to full capacity.

1815
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,210
You certainly have a knack for it.

1816
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,690
My father taught me a thing or two about mechanics.

1817
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,767
You know, I have a few girls in the East Group

1818
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,241
that have an interest in learning more about it.

1819
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,526
It is the future.

1820
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:36,001
I may bring them by, if it's all the same to you.

1821
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,564
That's not my decision, ma'am.

1822
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,764
That would be the supervisor's.

1823
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,449
Yes, that's true.

1824
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,284
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

1825
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,730
You know, Dorothy.

1826
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,363
Despite what you may think...

1827
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,767
I have nothing against y'all.

1828
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,121
I know.

1829
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,442
I know you probably believe that.

1830
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,286
DOROTHY: Good night, Katherine.

1831
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,486
Good night.

1832
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,449
Mama! Hey, babies.

1833
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,443
Mama. Hi.

1834
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,281
Hey-

1835
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,491
Oh, please don't tell me I missed someone's birthday.

1836
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,641
No, you didn't.

1837
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,881
No, you didn't, Mama.

1838
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,650
Madame, your seat.

1839
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,564
Well, thank you. (CHUCKLES)

1840
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,483
Wait, is it my birthday?

1841
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,801
CHILDREN: No, Mama.

1842
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,491
You all look so pretty.

1843
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,001
(CHUCKLES)

1844
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,847
Mama, what's going on?

1845
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,325
Good evening, Katherine.

1846
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,606
So you're not gonna say anything?

1847
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,205
It's not my place.

1848
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,240
You, either?

1849
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,088
Okay, I'm not gonna do this all night.

1850

(KATHERINE GASPS)

1851
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,490
Oh, mother of mercy.

1852
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,201
That's for me.

1853
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,648
Are you sad, Mama? No.

1854
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,041
It's okay, Mama. He's a good man.

1855
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,964
I know.

1856
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,281
(VOICE BREAKING) I just can't help it.

1857
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,204
He hasn't even asked you yet.

1858
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,169
I know, but he is.

1859
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,321
You are, right?

1860
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,720
If y'all will let me.

1861
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,008
Well, go on. She's already crying.

1862
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,525
Oh, hush.

1863
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,681
This was my mother's ring.

1864
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,965
It's beautiful.

1865
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,165
She and my father were married for...

1866
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,560
For 52 years.

1867
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,562
Figure it's about as lucky a ring as you can get.

1868
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,482
I know, but he is.

1869
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,723
and I said, "Mom, I met the woman I want to marry."

1870
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,086
What'd she say?

1871
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,730
She said, "She must be something, Jimmy.

1872
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,801
"Really something."

1873
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,081
Then what'd you say?

1874
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,480
I said, "No.

1875
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,569
"She's more than something.

1876
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,245
"She's everything."

1877
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,081
Now...

1878
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,490
I planned on this being more romantic.

1879
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,766
I'll make that up to you real soon.

1880
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,001
It's okay.

1881
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,084
But I know marrying you

1882
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,604
includes marrying your girls as well.

1883
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,091
Amen to that.

1884
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,761
I do.

1885
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,763
(CHUCKLES) I didn't ask you yet.

01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,690
the first American, into Earth's orbit...

1895
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:51,043
has already undergone five unmanned flight tests.

1896
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,201
NASA has confirmed

1897
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,045
that the IBM 790 data processing system...

1898
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,362
has been utilized to confirm all of the mission's...

launch and recovery system calculations.

1900

are progressing on schedule.

1902
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,969
Yes, sir. Right in here.

1903
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,641
You wanted to see me, sir?

1904
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,801
Have a seat.

1905
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,604
ls there something wrong, Mr. Harrison?

1906
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,330
No, there's nothing wrong.

1907
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,889
In fact, our IBM is churning out numbers

1908
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,122
in fractions of the time any human can.

1909
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,964
Present company included.

1910
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,130
That's good then.

1911
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,161
Maybe.

1912
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:29,605
The thing is, the Cape's now insisting

1913
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,047
on doing all the backups down there, on site.

1914
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,247
I see.

1915
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,322
So we won't be running backups here.

1916
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,325
And truth be told, we can't keep up with that IBM anyhow.

1917
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,523
Long story short, we no longer need

1918
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,170
a computer in this department.

1919
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,683
Progress is a double-edged sword.

1920
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,321
Let's have you report back to the West Group for now.

1921

I'm sorry about this.

01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,202
It's out of my hands, if you can believe that.

Mr. Harrison's idea, really.

1935
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,370
Although I suspect his wife did the picking out.

1936
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:05,364
Can't imagine he has an eye for anything but numbers.

1937
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,250
Now you have a great wedding.

1938

Hi, Reverend. How you doing?  How are you?

1942
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:49,169
I don't think I felt a thing the first time I did this.

1943
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:50,810
I was so nervous.

You think so? DOROTHY: Mmm.

Just a little older. (GASPS)

three years, two months, and three days afterwards...

1958
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,009

<i>to put Colonel John Glenn into orbit-</i>

1960

Colonel John Glenn will be the first American to orbit the Earth.

1961
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,041
As you can see, there are

thousands of people here today

1963
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,323

Well, then the IBM was wrong yesterday.

1968

01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,410
Thank you, CAPCOM.

2132
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,762
All right. Ten and a half hours to go.

2133
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,365
If we make seven round trips.

2134
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,131
I could use a coffee.

2135
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,968
NEWSCASTER: Well, as we approach the end ofthe day

2136
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,650
here on the Eastern Seaboard...

2137
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,531
Colonel Glenn is just beginning his third orbit...

2138
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,206
three-quarters of the way across the African continent.

2139
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,964
We see he's currently over Zanzibar...

2140
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,640
which is the next tracking station coming up.

2141
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,962
Thankfully, the Friendship 7 capsule is...

2142
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,325
New assignment came down the pike.

2143
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,047
Always changing around here.

2144
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,123
It's hard to keep up.

2145
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,131
Seems like they're going to need a permanent team

2146
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,043
to feed that IBM.

2147
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,645
How big of a team?

2148
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,723
Thirty, to start.

2149
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,721
Thank you for the information, Mrs. Mitchell.

2150
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:09,330
You're quite welcome, Mrs. Vaughan.

2151
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,687
Hmm.

2152
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,725
We have a warning light.

2153
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,368
CAPCOM 7, I have a warning light.

2154
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,681
Stand by, Seven.

2155
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,243
Sir, we have a warning light.

2156
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,285
What are we looking at, Paul?

2157
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,487
Uh...

2158
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,608
The heat shield may have come loose.

2159
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,842
Seven, will you confirm the landing bag

2160
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:13,921
is in the off position?

2161
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,450
Affirmative, CAPCOM.

2162
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:17,931
Al, we need to get him down now.

2163
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,809
He could burn up on re-entry.

2164
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,603
Come on, babies.

2165
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:31,886
There is a man in space.

2166
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,445
And we don't want to miss it, so we gotta hurry.

2167
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,284
MAN: Something's wrong with Glenn!

2168
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,726
What's going on? Come on, let's go.

2169
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,087
Come on. Hurry up, now. Y'all follow me.

2170
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,641
We just learned that the Friendship 7...

2171
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:45,810
is in danger of losing its heat shield.

2172
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:48,008
Have you heard any banging noises...

2173
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,810
or anything of this type at higher rates?

2174
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,325
That is a negative, CAPCOM.

2175
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,289
This poses a grave danger to the mission.

2176
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,240
Tell them not to jettison the retro-package.

2177
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,761
MAN: (ON RADIO) NASA is confirming there is

2178
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,001
some sort of malfunction

2179
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,121
with the capsule 's heat shield...

2180
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,601
and it may not stay in place.

2181
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,768
If the heat shield's loose...

2182
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:09,288
the retro-package straps might hold it in place.

2183
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:10,487
Will that work?

2184
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,324
It will work.

2185
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,051
It will hold it until he reaches the "Go/No-go" point.

2186
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,201
It will work.

2187
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,370
Al, he has to override the .05G.

2188
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,521
Do it.

2189
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,045
Friendship 7...

2190
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,044
we're recommending that the retro-package not...

2191
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,282
I repeat, not be jettisoned.

2192
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,326
This means that you will have to override the .05G switch.

2193
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:33,481
Roger.

2194
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,001
ls there a reason for this? Over.

2195
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,161
Stand by, Seven.

2196
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,681
Not at this time, Seven.

2197
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,485
Roger that, Command.

2198
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,166
I will make a manual .05G entry...

2199
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,681
and bring the scope in. Over.

2200
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:56,526
He knows.

2201
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,725
MAN: (OVER RADIO) Without a heat shield...

2202
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,684
there is no way that Colonel Glenn can get back

2203
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,887
through the Earth's atmosphere.

2204
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,724
The heat is simply too overpowering.

2205
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,562
A malfunction in the automatic control system...

2206
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,003
is causing the spacecraft to yaw in a skid-like fashion.

2207
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,844
Thus putting the Friendship 7's

2208
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,207
re-entry point in jeopardy.

2209
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:24,728
Even now, Colonel Glenn is streaking toward the United States-

2210
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,360
And he must begin the retro-sequence

2211
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,283
300 miles west of California...

2212
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,090
if he's to reenter the atmosphere

2213
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,401
at the designated point...

2214
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,449
and land in the recovery area

2215
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,404
700 miles south and east of Florida.

2216
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,211
Stay tuned to this station for further details.

2217

COMMANDER: You're going to be using fly-by-wire

2218
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,601
for re-entry.

2219
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,445
You'll need to maintain a zero angle, over.

2220
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,728
Roger. I'm on fly-by-wire.

He's crossing the communication blackout zone.

2228
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,451
There's a real fireball outside.
