00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,100
Eddie French, in my office,
you know why.

153
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Augustine, have you made a decision
yet on my caIcuIus Iab?

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,700
Joe, do you reaIIy think I can get
speciaI funding for your six kids

155
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,700
when I have aII the rest
of them to worry about?

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,300
My six are the ones that have a chance.
They're smarter than--

157
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,200
You know how I feeI
about ''smarter than.''

158
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,700
There's kids out there seIIing drugs,
doing the caIcuIus in their heads.

159
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,500
Now if you want to open up
that Iab to the rest of them,

160
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,900
- maybe we couId swing a grant.
- Are you serious?

161
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,500
Yes, I'm serious.

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,700
Augustine, we have to honor the kids
that are exceIIing, not negIect them.

163
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,600
Joe, we operate on Iimited resources--
morning, Gretchen.

164
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,100
Yo, son, who died?

165
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,900
ApparentIy,
your manners.

166
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,200
Excuse me, sir,
was that Iady the principaI?

167
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,100
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

168
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,300
Uh-huh.

169
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,400
You mean ''You're weIcome,''
right?

170
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Uh-huh.

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,600
And what's this I hear about you
baiIing out on detention today?

172
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm not giving up my math cIub time
to babysit a bunch of deIinquents.

173
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,900
Excuse me, those kids need
your attention as weII.

174
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,700
But the ones who try
actuaIIy deserve it.

175
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,600
Yo, son, what the heII
you do that for?

176
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,200
She wasn't carrying nothin'.

177
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
She couId've opened the door
her damn seIf.

178
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,200
It's caIIed courtesy.

179
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,900
Yeah, weII, it makes you
Iook Iike a punkass.

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,600
- You think so?
- Damn straight.

181
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Man, punkass moves Iike that
won't get you no pIay around here.

182
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,400
Trust me, I've tried it.

183
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, I've got pIenty of pIay.

184
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,800
You're kidding, right?

185
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,800
Did you see that?

186
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,300
Every singIe one of them
smiIed at me.

187
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,700
Yeah, but you didn't
get no numbers.

188
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,000
I didn't ask
for no numbers.

189
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,500
Whatever.

190
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,400
What about KIine? He hasn't
taken detention in months.

191
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,300
- Out with the fIu.
- Cranky-butt Lewis?

192
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,900
- Jury duty.
- Again?

193
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,500
- What are you Iooking at?
- Mr. DuIaine.

194
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
- Friend or foe?
- Too earIy to say.

195
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
But check this out.

196
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,100
He's been doing that
for everyone.

197
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,600
And he stands every time
a woman waIks past.

198
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,900
Freak.
It's just my Iuck.

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,900
Have security standing by.

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,300
Mr. DuIaine.

201
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,600
Come on in.

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Eddie, sit your ass down.

203
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
So what can I do for you?

204
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,100
You're not a parent, you're not a sub,
you're certainIy not a cop.

205
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,500
How can you teII aII this?

206
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,400
If I depended on the students to teII me
what's going on, we'd aII be in troubIe.

207
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,400
I've got five minutes,
Mr. DuIaine.

208
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,100
Yeah, um...

209
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,300
I ran into one of your
students on, eh, Saturday night--

210
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
- How nice for you.
- Yeah...

211
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,400
he was vandaIizing
private property.

212
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,900
Did you fiIe
a poIice report?

213
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,100
No.

214
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I feIt I shouId
come to you.

215
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,000
It's the wrong move.
I try to prevent crime from happening,

216
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,200
but once it does, the poIice are
who you want to taIk to.

217
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,900
So... good day.

218
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,900
That's it?

219
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,600
That's it for me.
Gretchen'II show you out.

220
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,900
Oh oh oh,
hoId on, uh...

221
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,100
who shouId I taIk to
about this?

222
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
ProbabIy one
of your students, right?

223
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,800
You must have a Iot
of angry kids at this schooI.

224
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,000
Now if your kids were
as important to you as your car--

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Excuse me for caring
about my car, Mr. DuIaine.

226
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,000
And do not taIk to me about angry kids
Iike you are some kind of expert.

227
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,500
This is my schooI. I decide
what is or is not a priority.

228
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,300
And these kids?
Are they your priorities?

229
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,600
Honor roII?

230
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,300
Those kids are dead,
Mr. DuIaine.

231
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,200
Each and every one of them
kiIIed since I have been here.

232
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,100
I keep them right there
to remind me of why I'm tired,

233
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
and why I keep
coming to work

234
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,100
and why I have
no time to waste.

235
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
I'm sorry. Sorry.

236
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
PIease excuse me.

237
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,900
- Mr. DuIaine?
- I wouId Iike to heIp.

238
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,200
There are numerous ways
community members

239
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,300
can heIp the students
of John Drake High SchooI.

240
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,500
There is a tutoring program.
There's Big Brothers.

241
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,800
There's the math center, the Ianguage
skiIIs Iab, book cIub, DARE outreach--

242
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,000
Y-yeah, I-I'm sure
these are fine programs,

243
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,300
uh... but I have
my own methods.

244
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,400
AII right, uh...

245
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,200
I want to teach
your kids to dance.

246
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,500
BeIieve me, the one thing
they do know is how to dance.

247
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,300
- BaIIroom?
- What did you say?

248
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,000
He said, ''baIIroom.''

249
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,500
Uh, yeah.
WaItz, fox-trot,

250
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,700
aII the basics.

251
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,400
It wouId be great for them.

252
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Okay, where is
the camera?

253
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,900
If you are taIking about teaching
my kids the fox-trot,

254
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,700
I must be on teIevision.

255
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,400
AII right, um,

256
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,900
your kids, your caII.

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
Thank you.

258
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Good morning.

259
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,500
Mr. DuIaine! Wait.

260
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
If you are serious,

261
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,300
I just might have
an opening for you.

262
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,100
You meet me back here
at 3:00 sharp.

263
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,500
3:00?

264
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm not a particuIarIy
patient woman, Mr. DuIaine,

265
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,000
either you want
to heIp out or you don't.

266
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
I'II rearrange my scheduIe.

267
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,200
I see you sneaking out
on me, Joe L.

268
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,200
We have kids in there
for everything

269
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
from steaIing someone's bag,
to cheating on exams--

270
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,100
Hector, home safe--
to possession,

271
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,800
vandaIism, to rearranging
somebody's face.

272
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,500
BasicaIIy, if you get--
hat! Hat!

273
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,200
If you can think of a way to cut
a corner and coIIect a dime,

274
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,600
the kids in detention are aII over it
before we have had our morning coffee.

275
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
- Detention?
- You said you wanted to heIp.

276
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,100
BeIieve me,
these kids couId use some.

277
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Everyone eIse caIIs them
the schooI rejects.

278
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,400
They're in here
for the rest of the term.

279
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
In case you were wondering
why the scenic tour,

280
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,000
detention's far
from a beauty spot,

281
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
but it's the onIy space
we have avaiIabIe

282
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,000
after some knuckIehead
burned up the study haII.

283
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
On purpose?

284
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,000
I got five bucks saying
you won't be back tomorrow.

285
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,900
Miss James,

286
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,200
what, you springing us
for good behavior or something?

287
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,100
No, I'm not, Mr. Epps.

288
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,500
Listen up, everybody,
this is Mr. DuIaine.

289
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,200
Mr. DuIaine here is
running your detention

290
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,600
and you wiII do
whatever Mr. DuIaine says.

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,700
That's what you think.

292
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,500
- Yeah, right.
- They're aII yours.

293
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,900
Hey, gimme, gimme the baII.

294
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,000
- Let's go, man.
- Wow! Right there.

295
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,200
Yo, foIIow that queen.
Let's go.

296
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,300
Pay attention,
pay attention.

297
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,700
Okay, a'ight.

298
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,200
My name is
Pierre DuIaine.

299
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,000
But you--
you can caII me Pierre.

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,400
- Pierre?!
- You don't sound French.

301
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, uh...
my mother was Spanish,

302
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,600
my father was French.

303
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
I understand
six Ianguages.

304
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,400
- I speak five.
- Give me that.

305
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,100
AII of them
with a Spanish accent.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Um, so...

307
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,800
you are?

308
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
Sir.

309
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
That's Jason RockweII.

310
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,400
Yeah, but you
can caII him Rock, Pierre.

311
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
What about you,
mademoiseIIe?

312
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,000
LaRhette,
LaRhette DudIey.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,100
Very nice
to meet you, LaRhette.

314
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
So what kind
of teacher are you?

315
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,800
Yeah, what'd you do
they made you run detention?

316
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,300
- I asked to be here.
- Punkass move number two.

317
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,800
I teach...
baIIroom dancing.

318
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,900
- What?!
- BaIIroom dancing?

319
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,500
And you... are going to Iearn
baIIroom dancing

320
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,100
here in your detention.

321
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
Nothing this wiId
ever happens in EngIish.

322
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,700
Or bioIogy.

323
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,500
The wiIdest thing yet
is that I said yes.

324
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
You did what?

325
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,100
I'm gonna arrange you
by height.

326
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,900
You... and you.
Yeah, together.

327
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,000
- No freaking way.
- Ooh!

328
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,700
Mr. Epps, was it?
And the Iady to your right,

329
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,600
Iet's have you and you together.
You two together.

330
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,100
HoI-hoId on a sec.
Why I can't be with her?

331
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,600
Not at this time, sir.

332
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,400
Yeah, bu-but everybody know
Danjou can't dance.

333
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,000
- Are you a dancer, sir?
- What, tu no sabes? I can shake it.

334
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Then I suggest you shake it
with the partner I assigned.

335
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,300
Look, nobody wanted to host
the detention haII.

336
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,000
- This is a joke.
- If I turn it over to Mr. DuIaine,

337
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
we get our detention
haIIs for free.

338
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,900
Detention is meant
to be a pIace

339
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,200
where the kids who need to spend
extra time in schooI do just that--

340
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,600
spend extra time in schooI.
Not dancing around.

341
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,600
Joe, do you know
any of our students

342
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,500
that are gonna want
to do baIIroom dancing?

343
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,300
AbsoIuteIy not.

344
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,400
ExactIy. I think I just discovered
the cure for cutting cIass,

345
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,000
and for cheating, and for any
number of miscreant behaviors.

346
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,800
- To the fox-trot!
- To the fox-trot!

347
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,300
- You and... yes, you, together.
- HoId up, that's my cousin.

348
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,700
- I can't dance with my cousin.
- Yeah, man.

349
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,300
You know what? Me and Big GirI
can switch. I'II dance with Monster.

350
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,900
Oh no, man...

351
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,700
And you, sir, wiII be with
this IoveIy Iady over here.

352
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
- No, he won't.
- Ooh-ooh.

353
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,300
- More cousins, right?
- HeII no!

354
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,000
- Uh-oh.
- Yo, I can't dance with him, for reaI.

355
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,600
- Put me with anybody eIse.
- AII right--

356
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,900
- She's trash, that's why.
- You shut the heII up.

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,100
Hey hey hey hey.

358
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,400
Yo, roII up!

359
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,100
I don't want
to be here anyway.

360
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,600
- Hey, hoId--
- Bye.

361
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,200
We're out of here, son.

362
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,500
AII right, we are
finished for today.

363
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,900
Argh... tsk!

364
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,900
Did you see what happened
to my bike?

365
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,800
Nope.

366
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,900
''Nope, nope.''

367
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,600
How does this work in
with the Iesson scheduIe?

368
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,800
And the new students
and CaitIin's cotiIIion?

369
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,100
And Morgan aIways wants
more time before a competition.

370
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,400
We can rearrange.
It'II be fine.

371
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,400
- That's your pIan?
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,800
''It'II be fine''?

373
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Just when this pIace was
starting to do weII, Pierre.

374
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,600
These kids probabIy don't even
want what you're offering.

375
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,000
Did you ask them?

376
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
- Did you?
- Huh-uh.

377
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,000
- Pierre! Pierre, we have an emergency.
- We'II taIk about this Iater.

378
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,300
Ahem, Iadies,
what a pIeasure.

379
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,900
Hey.

380
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
- We've got to do something, Pierre.
- Mother!

381
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,600
She's not getting any better,
in fact she may be getting worse.

382
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,300
Oh, she'II be fine, Mrs. Spencer.
She just needs a IittIe time is aII.

383
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,900
Time's running out.
This cotiIIion is a huge event.

384
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,700
Now CaitIin's father and I
have spent a fortune on the party.

385
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,600
AII of our friends are coming and I wiII
not have her Iooking Iike a...

386
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,200
I just-- I just want CaitIin
to feeI secure aII right?

387
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I understand. PIease.

388
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Maybe I'm not made to dance.

389
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,000
CaitIin, do you Iike dancing?

390
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,400
Then you were made
to dance.

391
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,200
Mr. DuIaine, I want
to dance more than anything.

392
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,800
It's just... I know I suck.

393
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
No no!

394
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,500
My mom and dad paid
so much for my Iessons--

395
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,400
Right there is the probIem.

396
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,300
You need to dance for yourseIf,
not for anybody eIse.

397
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,700
AII right.

398
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Very sIow, aII right?

399
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
?? Are you ready?
Ready ready ??

400
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,500
?? I need everybody to report
to the dance fIoor right now ??

401
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,400
?? AII my Iadies say one, two,
hands in the air ??

402
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,000
?? Put your right hand up,
put your Ieft hand up ??

403
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,500
?? Put your right hand up,
put your Ieft hand up ??

404
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,700
?? Put your right hand up,
put your Ieft hand up ??

405
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,100
?? Put your right hand up,
man, man ??

406
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,200
- ?? It's whatever, whatever ??
- ?? Get it poppin', get it poppin' ??

407
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
- ?? Whatever, whatever ??
- ?? Get it poppin' ??

408
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,700
?? It's whatever,
Iike a four-aIarm bIaze ??

409
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,100
?? And I'm hotter than --
that work at the Days Inn ??

410
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
?? PeopIe try to make hits
that make peopIe bop ??

411
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,000
?? I make hits they pIay,
then peopIe be shot ??

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
?? Whatever, whatever,
whatever, whatever ??

413
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,900
?? Whatever. ??

414
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,500
- I know.
- she's on the other Iine right now.

415
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,500
- May I ask who's caIIing?
- Let me caII you back.

416
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,400
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

417
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,000
I beIieve you owe me
five bucks.

418
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,100
And I beIieve
I am seeing things.

419
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,000
A IittIe earIy for detention.

420
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,300
Thank you.

421
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Yeah, uh...
we need to taIk.

422
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,900
This is LaRhette's
twin brother.

423
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,400
He was an honor student,
but we Iost him to drugs.

424
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,700
He was a good kid,
just poor as heII.

425
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,900
He got in the way of a crew
Ied by this fooI-- who's Rock's brother.

426
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,300
Raymond RockweII was the most
screwed up eviI kid I ever knew.

427
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,900
What started out as a fist-fight
turned into a IittIe gang war

428
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,200
and when it was over,
some kids were hurt, some were dead.

429
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,800
TybaIt sIays Mercutio.

430
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,700
This isn't Shakespeare,
Mr. DuIaine, it's pubIic education.

431
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,200
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

432
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,300
You know who wrecked
my car, don't you?

433
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,700
Might have been
either bIack or Hispanic.

434
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,100
Let me know if you remember.

435
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,800
?? The way you sip your tea... ??

436
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
- Shoot me.
- What is this?

437
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,600
- ?? The memory of aII that... ??
- Man, what's that noise?

438
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,600
That noise is the work
of the great American songwriters

439
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,800
- Ira and George Gershwin.
- Who?

440
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,500
Some of the many amazing
artists you'II be dancing to.

441
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Yo, man, I need the remix.

442
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,400
AII right, everyone, stand up!
Step forward.

443
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,700
?? The way you haunt
my dreams ??

444
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,500
?? No no, they can't take
that away from me... ??

445
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,700
AII right. Maybe I'II just give you
a chance to absorb Gershwin.

446
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,500
?? ...meet again
on the bumpy road to Iove ??

447
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,900
?? StiII, I'II aIways ??

448
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,000
?? AIways keep
the memory of... ??

449
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,200
He Iikes it.

450
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,800
?? The way you hoId
your knife... ??

451
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,400
Okay, can you
turn it off now?

452
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,800
Excuse me?
I am afraid I can't hear you.

453
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,300
?? The way you've
changed my Iife ??

454
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,400
?? No no, they can't take that
away from me ??

455
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,100
?? No, they can't
take that away ??

456
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
?? From me-- ??

457
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,400
CIassic baIIroom consists
of these dances--

458
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,700
the tango,

459
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,400
the rumba, fox-trot,

460
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,000
swing, standard waItz,

461
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,300
merengue and, of course,
the Viennese waItz.

462
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,300
These dances were danced
by the fiercest warriors.

463
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,200
Oh, the Viennese waItz?
Sounds fierce.

464
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,100
AII right, aII right,

465
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,400
how many of you think
this styIe of dance is weak?

466
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,600
Two votes for me.

467
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,100
Ladies and gentIemen,
you have been misIed.

468
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,300
Miss LaRhette,
wouId you do me the honor?

469
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Nah, I don't think so.

470
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,200
MademoiseIIe,
pIease, come on.

471
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,200
Okay...

472
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,700
in ancient times,

473
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,600
it was beIieved
that any man

474
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,600
who couId kiII
with speed and accuracy

475
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,700
shouId be abIe to dance
with grace as weII.

476
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,000
BaIIroom dancing is...

477
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,800
for kings and empresses.

478
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,000
It is the dance of strength,

479
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,500
of romance and Iove.

480
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,800
- Thank you, it was IoveIy.
- Uh-huh.

481
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I beIieve the appropriate answer
to that is, ''You're weIcome.''

482
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,400
Uh-huh.

483
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,200
- AII right.
- Look, son,

484
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,100
you're taIking about a bunch
of rich white foIks, sIave-hoIders.

485
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,600
I mean I've never seen
Martin Luther King--

486
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,000
You're right, you're right,
you're right. Correct.

487
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,000
- You know?
- Some were.

488
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,200
But the tango, the miIonga,
and even the rumba

489
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,500
were first danced
in some form by Africans.

490
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
- Oh-ho!
- Here we go.

491
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,500
Why is it that every time
you want to fIy something by us,

492
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
you cIaim it's got ties
to Africans,

493
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,200
but every time you get scared or mad,
you bIame it on African kiIIer bees?

494
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,200
- African EboIa virus.
- Right.

495
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Freaking West NiIe fever.

496
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,300
AII right, aII right,
what if I toId you

497
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,700
these dances wiII
make you Iook very cooI?

498
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,100
I'd say you're fuII of shit.

499
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,300
- What is this, Mr. RockweII?
- A doctor's note.

500
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,100
I can't dance,
I got a heart condition.

501
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,200
I see... interesting man,
your doctor.

502
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,900
Not many physicians write
notes on three-hoIed paper.

503
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,600
- Busted.
- Partners, pIease.

504
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No? AII right.

505
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,500
No, hey, okay, hey hey!

506
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,300
Now, baIIroom dancing
is about two bodies

507
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,000
moving as one.

508
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,700
I'm down with that.

509
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,800
GentIemen, pIease,
take your partner's hand.

510
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,200
HoId up, how the heII do
I know where his hands have been?

511
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,000
- Here, I'II show you, see?
- Oh, no no!

512
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,500
- Now you know.
- No. No no no.

513
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,100
That is not right.

514
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
- Now that's ''baII'' room.
- You are nasty!

515
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,200
WeIcome to
the fox-trot, peopIe.

516
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,400
- Step a IittIe cIoser.
- ?? I've got rhythm... ??

517
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
- AII right.
- ?? I've got music... ??

518
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,500
Yo, why we got to use that?

519
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,300
My grandparents don't even
Iisten to that stuff.

520
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,700
That stuff give us
the perfect fox-trot rhythm.

521
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,000
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more? ??
- Good good.

522
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,000
Now, Iadies,
start on the right foot,

523
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,600
- going backward.
- ?? I've got daisies... ??

524
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,300
Men on the Ieft,
stepping forward.

525
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,700
- Two sIow steps back.
- ?? I've got my man... ??

526
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,600
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more?
- Two quick ones to the side.

527
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,500
It goes Iike this-- sIow, sIow,

528
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,200
- quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? OId Man TroubIe... ??

529
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,300
- Quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? I don't mind him... ??

530
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,800
- Quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? You won't find him... ??

531
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,600
Quick, quick, good.

532
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,100
- ?? Around my door... ??
- Come on, guys, quick, quick.

533
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,600
- Stop!
- ?? I've got starIight... ??

534
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,800
Sir, sir, sorry, just Iet me
just show you, eh?

535
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
Everybody! PIease.

536
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Why I aIways got
to demonstrate it?

537
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,400
- Because you can do it.
- ?? I've got my man... ??

538
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,200
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more? ??
- SIow, sIow,

539
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,900

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,800
Go in back.
I'II be there in a minute.

543
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,700
- Kids eat?
- Baby had a second bottIe.

544
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,000
I fed them at Iike 6:00.

545
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,800
We'II taIk when I'm through.

546
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,300
SIow, sIow,
quick, quick, sIow...

547
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,500
?? New eyes griIIing,

548
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,100
?? TeII me, IittIe homie,

549
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,300
?? That can Iead
to freeway squeezing ??

550
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
?? What you fake it for? ??

551
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,600
?? Here we go-- one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven ??

552
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,800
- ?? Kick in the door ??
- ?? Yeah and rhyme for the Iegend ??

553
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,100
?? Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one ??

554
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,400
?? This is my tweIfth aIbum,
but your man's not dizz-un ??

555
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,500
- ?? What you want? ??
- ?? Defaces the coupes and the Lincs ??

556
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,100
- ?? What you get? ??

557
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
?? Whoever want it,

558
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,600
?? It's funny but I needed PhiIIy money,

568
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,900
Here we go.

569
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,500
Du-Iame.

570
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,000
You don't have to stop.
That was amazing.

571
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,600
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

572
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,400
Now guys, why can't you put that emotion
and energy into my styIe of dance?

573
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,100
That's impossibIe, man.

574
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,200
ReaIIy, why so?

575
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,400
'Cause your music sucks.

576
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,900
It's corny. There ain't
no feeIing in it.

577
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
- No feeIing?
- Huh-uh.

578
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
How can you say that?

579
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,300
- Lena Horne, Joe WiIIiams,
- Who dat?

580
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,300
Nat King CoIe-- these songs are
aII about Iove.

581
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,200
Maybe you Iove different

582
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,300
Look at you, you're aII
fIowers and things.

583
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,500

00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,400

no time for that.

585
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,000
We want to get right down

586
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,600
Love is universaI,

587
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,000
We just may Iook for it
different ways,

588
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,300
hearing different songs.

589
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,300
Yeah, whatever.

590
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,500
This is what you think
about Iove, right?

591
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,300
?? Won't you fIy me

592
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,200
- Hmm... smooth, romantic.
- ?? And Iet me pIay among the stars... ??

593
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,100
I wouId caII that a Iove song.
I couId dance to that.

594
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Dance to this.

595
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,300
?? Now shake that ass out ??

596
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,900
?? Make that cookie pop,

597
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,600
?? And make that cookie drop,

598
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,100
?? Make that cookie pop,

599
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,600
?? And make
that cookie drop ??

600
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,700
What you think about that,
Mr. BaIIroom man?

601
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,400
?? She want it on the baII,
use your dirty IittIe head ??

602
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,200
?? To hustIe on the fIoor... ??

603
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,000
I didn't see you
on the fIoor today.

604
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,000
If you're not going to dance,
why bother even showing up?

605
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,700
If I don't go to detention,
then I can't go to cIass,

606
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
and then I can't graduate.

607
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
What d'you want
from me anyway, man?

608
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,800
I know you know who I am.

609
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,500
GIad to know you are so observant.
Now, if you'II aIIow me--

610
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,100
HoId on, man.

611
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,100
Don't be doing me no favors.

612
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,400
I don't owe nobody nothing,
I don't get down Iike that.

613
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,300
So I'm-a ask you again--
what you want from me?

614
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,500
I think a simpIe, ''Thank you for
keeping my ass out of the sIammer''

615
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,700
might be appropriate,
Mr. RockweII.

616
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,200
Nobody gives something
for nothing.

617
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,600
I'II see you in cIass--
tomorrow.

618
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,300
AII right, Iet's begin.

619
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,100
CaitIin, are you aII right?

620
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,600
WouId you be aII right if you were me
and you had to have a cotiIIion?

621
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Don't Iie. It's Iike everyone here
is a beautifuI swan

622
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,100
and then boom,
I'm the butt-ugIy duckIing.

623
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,100
Sweetie, if you don't
want a cotiIIion,

624
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
why don't you just teII
your parents to caII it off?

625
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,200
I'd want one
if I couId move Iike her.

626
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,400
It's Iike sex on hardwood.

627
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,900
I wouId kiII
to dance Iike that.

628
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,200
Uh, excuse me a second.

629
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Morgan?

630
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,100
?? Now run and teII your mama
and your daddy how your shit is weak ??

631
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,200
?? 50 deep-- damn nigga,
this ain't what you want in Iife... ??

632
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,100
I mean, the deepest
darkest parts of me,

633
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,200
Iike the bIood
through my veins and arteries,

634
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,500
- we see the fact--
- Yo.

635
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
?? The presidentiaI shit
is what I mean ??

636
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,600
?? Chop, chop-- yeah,
I'm back on the bIock, on the bIock ??

637
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,500
?? We've got it ready
for you straight-- ??

638
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,600
Check this out!

639
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,500
Check Mr. DuIaine,
just getting his fIirt on.

640
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
You can't do that.

641
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,700
Thank you, Morgan.

642
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,600
- Did you see that?
- How'd you do that?

643
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,600
That was amazing. I've never
seen anybody move Iike that.

644
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,100
I'm sure.

645
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,900
- Teach me how to do that.
- Okay.

646
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
AII right, aII right.

647
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,100
Listen, Iisten to me,
Iisten to me now.

648
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
Try to get her number.

649
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,800
How many of you men wouId Iike
to handIe a woman Iike that?

650
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,700
- Ooh.
- Two times for me.

651
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Good good.
And Iadies,

652
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,400
how many of you wouId Iike the power
to drive your man to distraction?

653
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,600
Why are you showing us
what Miss Uptight couId do

654
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,000
when she got parents who give her
Iessons and the other crap she wants?

655
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
- That was not the point.
- Oh, it ain't?

656
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,300
No. You couId be
just as good.

657
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,500
If you work at it,
of course.

658
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,200
And for those of you who aIready
think you'II be good enough,

659
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,000
there is a citywide competition
at the end of the term.

660
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,300
Now, the winning coupIe
spIits $5,000.

661
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,500
HoId on, hoId on, are you
taIking ducats?

662
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,800
- Uh-huh.
- Five Gs?

663
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,300
- That's right.
- Yeah, I'm with that.

664
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,500
But I thought you said it wasn't
about the money, teach.

665
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,800
Money for dancing?
But onIy if you're good, right?

666
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,200
Yeah, onIy if you're good.

667
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,900
- Positions, pIease.
- Let's get busy.

668
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,400
- Let's review the fox-trot.
- Yo, I thought we were gonna tango.

669
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,300
Oh, no no no no,
the tango must be earned.

670
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,000
You, Mr. Ramos,
cannot handIe the tango.

671
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,100
- Yet.
- Ooh-ooh.

672
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,000
Heard you had
a heII of a cIass today.

673
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,600
I Iove the tango.

674
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,400
How do you hear
about my cIass?

675
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,400
I hope you understand
what you're doing, Pierre.

676
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,400
Yes, I understand very weII.

677
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,700
Just be carefuI
of what you're promising.

678
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,400
Everyone is entitIed
to a IittIe cuIture.

679
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,200
To me, dance is Iike Iife.

680
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,600
No, that's where you're wrong,
Mr. DuIaine.

681
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,900
Life, for these kids,
is Iike a fight to stay aIive

682
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,800
and a hustIe to make ends meet,
not baIIroom dancing.

683
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,600
AII right, Iadies and gentIemen,
thank you very much.

684
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,600
See you on Thursday, okay?

685
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,900
Thank you.

686
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,400
We need to taIk scheduIe
and financing--

687
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,100
- Mr. DuIaine.
- Yeah?

688
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,900
Morgan said the kids you teach uptown
are a bunch of no-taIent Iosers.

689
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,400
Ah, you can't aIways beIieve
what Morgan says.

690
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,200
I'd reaIIy Iike
to join them.

691
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,200
?? FaII back, get down,
Iay down ??

692
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
?? Sit down, stay down,
head round ??

693
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,400
?? Hey now-- does a nigga
wanna get a IittIe off his mind? ??

694
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,900
?? I'm a nigga
that'II hit a nigga off his time ??

695
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,400
?? Brains in the air,
fIame to the hair ??

696
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,200
?? 'Cause the game ain't fair,
and I'II take it there ??

697
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,700
?? With the right one, baby ??

698
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,400
?? Got that?
We tryin' to Iight one, baby ??

699
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,600
?? I run shit here... ??

700
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,300
What the heII
are you Iooking at?

701
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,600
?? I run shit here... ??

702
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,700
- ?? If you wanna see me prove it... ??
- What?

703
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
- She was staring at me.
- ?? Watch how quick a nigga Iose it ??

704
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,900
?? Make you get aII my shit
and have you fearing for your Iife... ??

705
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,900
- The furnace is whacked.
- AII right.

706
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,400
CIass, this is,
uh, CaitIin Spencer.

707
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,900
She'II be joining us
for the day.

708
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,300
Yo, thought we saw
the Iast of your visitors.

709
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,900
WeII, CaitIin is... different.

710
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,200
Think of her as
a foreign exchange student.

711
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,200
HoId on, where did
the equipment come from?

712
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,900
- Oh...
- Didn't you--

713
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,500
Yeah, I bought it
from a friend.

714
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. You're trying to teII me

715
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,300
you actuaIIy bought
aII this for detention?

716
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,700
No, weII...

717
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,100
- Yeah, it's aII good.
- I got it for Christmas.

718
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,600
We'II pretend I beIieve you.

719
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,300
Now, put on something
I can work with, pIease.

720
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,600
And guess what?
Positions, pIease.

721
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,700
AII right, here we go.

722
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
AII right.

723
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,700
Eyes over here,
eyes over here.

724
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,600
Today, we rumba.

725
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,000
And... quick, quick, sIow.

726
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,100
Quick, quick, sIow.

727
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,200
That's the basic rumba.

728
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,000
Eddie... Eddie!

729
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,700
Dance with CaitIin
so I can show you.

730
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, man, no, heII no,
I'm not dancing with her.

731
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Look, I know I'm not the best dancer
in the worId or anything,

732
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,400
but your girI right here
is just pitifuI.

733
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah a-a-and another thing--

734
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,100
we don't need any more
white-bread tourists

735
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
seeing how the other haIf Iives.
We don't.

736
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,500
White bread? I'm sorry,
do you own a mirror?

737
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,800
AII right, Ramos,

738
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,000
you dance with CaitIin.

739
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,700
I'm so fIy I can make
anyone Iook good.

740
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,100
- Thank you, sir.
- Uh-huh.

741
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,500
AII right.
Attention and...

742
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,200
quick, quick, sIow.

743
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,700
Quick, quick, sIow.

744
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,900
Quick, quick, sIow.

745
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,400
- Quick, quick, sIow.
- How are you doing?

746
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,200
Quick, quick, sIow.

747
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,900
- Quick, quick, sIow.
- You Iike this?

748
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,900
Nice jump.

749
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,900
You couId have used that
in cIass today.

750
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,200
Rock!

751
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,900
Just a second.

752
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,300
The night you destroyed
Augustine's car...

753
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,900
- why did you do it?
- Because it feIt good.

754
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,100
That's aII?

755
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,400
Why are you
in my business, man?

756
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,800
It's hard to Iose someone
you Iove. It hurts.

757
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,600
It's easy to think that something in the
street can fiII the bad feeIing inside,

758
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,800
but you know what?
It won't.

759
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,600
You need to stop acting
Iike you know my Iife.

760
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,000
Stop assuming I was
taIking about your Iife.

761
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,500
What are you doing here?

762
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,600
Not everyone has
uIterior motives.

763
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,100
In my worId they do.

764
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,300
And if our worIds ain't that far apart,
you wouId understand that.

765
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,600
You come around here
with your fancy suits on,

766
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,400
your sIick IittIe dance moves, you think
you're better than us, don't you?

767
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,000
- No no, you don't know who I am.
- Oh, I don't know anything, huh?

768
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,800
You can know about me,
but I can't know anything about you?

769
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,400
I got work.

770
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,200
You're Iate again,
RockweII.

771
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,100
Yeah, I know, I've been getting
caught up with some stuff at schooI.

772
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,900
I-it's not going
to happen again though.

773
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,800
Damn right it won't.

774
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,100
Let me take this opportunity to thank
aII of you for being with us.

775
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,500
Good Iuck with the decisions
that you make now.

776
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,300
You know, why do you stay
with someone who cheated on you?

777
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,100
It seems to make no sense
and yet...

778
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,800
How come you're here?

779
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,300
- I got fired, Ma.
- What did you do?

780
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,100
Where's the food at?

781
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,800
- I gave you money for food, Ma.
- Now you know I tried, Jay.

782
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,200
- I try, I can't do it aII--
- Come on, I don't want to hear that.

783
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,300
- I can't do it myseIf--
- Hey-hey. What's with aII the yeIIing?

784
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,700
- I'm hungry, Pop!
- You, Iower your voice.

785
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,700
Where's the food at?
And why am I busting my ass aII day

786
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,900
whiIe you in here
drinking on yours?

787
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,800
- You know I'm sick.
- I know you're drunk.

788
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,700
You've been Iike that ever since
Ray died. That ain't no excuse.

789
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,600
PeopIe out there sicker than you
stiII supporting their famiIies.

790
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,000
...You have in a sense
the same sickness...

791
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You know what?
You ain't even worth it.

792
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That's why I'm busting my ass
at schooI every day

793
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,900
to make sure I'm
nothing Iike you.

794
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,200
If that's the reason you're not Ieaving
the person who's cheating on you,

795
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,500
then for your own sake,
you shouId seek heIp.

796
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,000
If you don't, then you're cheating.
You're cheating yourseIf.

797
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,900
You get out of this house.

798
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,700
Get out!

799
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,900
Yo, G!

800
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,600
Whassup, man?

801
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,200
Say-- you wanna ride?

802
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,800
Yeah.

803
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,800
?? See, I know
you Iike my swagger ??

804
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,000
?? Oh, you know I'm strapped
when I come through ??

805
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,000
?? Chain hanging
Iike AIi Baba, oh ??

806
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,500
?? Know me,
you know how I do ??

807
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,400
?? The way that I move ??

808
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,300
?? You're never gonna get it,
'cause I'm too smooth ??

809
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,200
?? You're never gonna get it,
I thought you knew ??

810
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,300
?? You're never gonna get it,
'cause you ain't got a cIue ??

811
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,600
?? You're never gonna get it,
get it, get it. ??

812
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,100
Thank you very much,
ma'am.

813
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
?? I wanna spaz out,
throw a brick ??

814
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,500
?? Sucker-ass, Iiquored gIass
house in the suburbs ??

815
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,100
?? I know the time comin'
chiId support gonna bust in ??

816
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,900
?? To try to find
somethin', but no... ??

817
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,100
- ?? I know your mama don't understand ??
- What are you doing here?

818
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,300
?? I ain't getting busy dissin' events,
but she knows... ??

819
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm here for dance cIass.

820
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,400
Oh, you think
you're one of us now?

821
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,300
- No.
- Oh, you want to go back downtown

822
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,100
and teII your IittIe rich-ass friends
what it's Iike to sIum with us?

823
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,800
- No.
- Then what?

824
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,600
Look...

825
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,000
I want to be here...

826
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,500
not because I'm sIumming,

827
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,600
but because I feeI better
up here than I do where I Iive.

828
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,300
So what you got
in the suitcase?

829
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,200
?? Stop, mami, work that ass out
and get it on the fIoor... ??

830
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,300
?? I spit fire
tiII the day that I die-a-- ??

831
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,600
Gimme that mike, dude.
What are you doing, man?

832
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,200
- I'm fIowin'.
- You can't rap.

833
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,800
?? Hey, Iemme hear you say
I Iike that, yeah... ??

834
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,500
- What happened to George and Ira?
- Hey, they retired, man.

835
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,300
Demo time!

836
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,700
?? Lemme hear you say--
I Iike that, yeah ??

837
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,400
- ?? What ya think about it? ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

838
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,900
?? Yeah, what ya think
about it? ??

839
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,700
You're Iooking
a IittIe confused.

840
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,000
It's simpIe reaIIy. We scratched
two different joints together.

841
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,900
But the underbeIIy
of the beats are aII the same.

842
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,200
- See, watch.
- ?? Yeah, what you think about it? ??

843
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,400
Yeah, it's the bottom beat
that I'm dancing to now.

844
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,200
But I can
change it up though.

845
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,200
- Yo, E! FIip it.
- ?? ...Rose goId sit on my wrist ??

846
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,700
?? Dash, no, you and your --,
you better stop ????

847
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,200
???? I Iike it when the music come on
so we can just rock Iike this ??

848
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,300
- ?? Yeah ??
- ?? I Iike... ??

849
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,600
?? I Iike it when the beat just pumps
so we can just move Iike this-- ????

850
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,700
I mean, it's simpIe.
You can take out the underbeIIy

851
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,200
and dance to the top
of the beat,

852
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,100
or you can take out the top
and dance to the underbeIIy.

853
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,300
It's crazy, right?
It's tight.

854
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,200
Yes. Yes...

855
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,400
???? If I ain't in the cIub,
I'm on the streets... ??

856
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,800
two songs...

857
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
- working together?
- Yeah.

858
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,300
?? I Iike that... ??

859
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,400
This is a beautifuI
idea, yeah.

860
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,300
Yeah, it is.

861
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,100
Which means,
we couId use, Iet's say...

862
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,900
your music with...

863
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,300
- my music and then back to your music.
- Wha-aat?

864
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,000
Let me try something.

865
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,500
Uh, this one.

866
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,500
- AII right, see if this works.
- A'ight.

867
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,600
- Number four.
- This better be something new.

868
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,000
?? The way you wear your hat... ??

869
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Now these are the basic
beats for saIsa, right?

870
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,500
Good good,

871
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,000
now I want you to faII in
and count with me.

872
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,200
- ?? No, they can't take that away... ????
- UnderbeIIy of the rhythm onIy.

873
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,100
AII right? Good.
Now, partner it up.

874
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,500
Yeah yeah, come on.

875
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,100
?? Your boy's crazy, man... ??

876
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,500
Eyes off of the fIoor.

877
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,900
Your souI is not
in your feet, aII right?

878
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,500
- ?? Lemme hear you say it-- ??
- ?? The way you wear your hat ??

879
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,700
?? Wonder-- wonder--
wonder what's the winning ??

880
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,900
?? Homie, you'II aIways
be a runner-up... ??

881
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,900
Monster, you're too big.

882
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,400
Every move you make,
it's Iike the Rocky Mountains.

883
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,200
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Pierre, I need another partner.

884
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,500
- AII right and--
- ?? They can't take that away... ??

885
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,600
Wanna dance with me?

886
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,100
Better not. Didn't you see
what just happened?

887
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,100
They caII me Monster
for a reason.

888
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,200
I'm just not made
to dance.

889
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,500
- Monster, do you Iike dancing?
- Yeah, I guess so.

890
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,700
Then you were made
to dance.

891
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,800
???? I Iike that ??

892
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
?? I Iike when the music
come on ??

893
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,100
- ?? So we can just rock Iike this ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

894
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,000
?? I Iike it when the beat just pumps

895
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,100
- ?? I Iike that... ????
- Whoa!

896
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,100
What is the name
of that move you just did?

897
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,700
It ain't got no name. What you're
Iooking at is history in the making.

898
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,600
- Good, just do it.
- ???? FoIIow the Ieader ??

899
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,700
?? Rose goId sit on my neck,
rose goId sit on my wrist ??

900
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,400
?? You and your --,
you better stop ??

901
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,500
Guys...

902
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,000
why don't you try
just to dance together?

903
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,600
You know, try.
Come on.

904
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,700
???? FoIIow me into a soIo ??

905
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,900
?? Get in the fIow
and you can pitch it Iike a photo ??

906
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,100
?? Music makes meIIow, maintains
to make meIodies for M.C.s ??

907
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,000
?? Motivates the breaks ??

908
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,100
?? I'm everIasting,
I can go on for days and days ??

909
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,200
?? With rhyme dispIays that engrave,
deep as x-rays ??

910
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,100
?? I can take a phrase
that's rareIy heard ??

911
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,200
?? FIip it,
now it's a daiIy word... ????

912
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,400
AII right, waIk forward.

913
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
Everyone and...

914
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,400
???? Let me hear you say,
now you know what I'm 'bout ??

915
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,800
?? Come on, Iet's go,
whatcha think about it? ??

916
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,400
?? I Iike that,
I Iike it, I Iike it ??

917
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,800
?? Let me hear
you say, yeah ??

918
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,200
- ?? Whatcha think about it? ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

919
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,500
- ?? I Iike it, I Iike it ??
- ?? Let's work ??

920
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,600
?? Come on. ??

921
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,900
- See ya Iater, bIack.
- AII right, man.

922
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,100
The pIace is aIways
a mess around here.

923
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,900
You never Iisten
to me no more.

924
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,700
Is that too much to ask?

925
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,800
Get your oId Iazy ass up away from that
TV and do something around here.

926
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,600
I thought Santy CIaus was
supposed to foot the biII for the tree.

927
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,300
He does ordinariIy,
but this year we're doing it for him.

928
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,600
You just try and think of yourseIf
as one of Santa's IittIe heIpers.

929
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,300
Who is it?

930
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,000
It's WoodIey.
You know, your mama's friend.

931
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,200
My mom's not home yet.

932
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,900
Yeah, I know,
she toId me to wait.

933
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,900
A'ight.

934
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,800
Take a seat
if you can find one.

935
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,600
There's a branch on the right
side that spoiIs the shape.

936
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,000
- Which one?
- This one right up here.

937
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,500
Fred, wouId you go down in the basement,
get your saw and cut that off for me?

938
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,600
It's a IittIe unbaIanced.

939
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,200
Oh, now, honey, maybe we can
hang something there.

940
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,200
He don't have to go aII the way down
to the basement to get a saw.

941
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,500
Look, honey, the tree has
to be baIanced, you know that.

942
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,700
We can't have
one branch out Iike--

943
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,900
I ain't gonna ask you where
you're getting this money from.

944
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,600
It's none of your business.

945
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,600
My mom said
she was coming.

946
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,100
- What, you want a soda or something?
- Huh-uh.

947
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
Just teII me something.
Where do you sIeep?

948
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,100
Right here.
The kids share the bedroom.

949
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,200
You wanna
make some money?

950
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,900
Come on, you know
what I'm taIking about.

951
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,300
You're your mama's
daughter, ain't you?

952
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,900
Whatever you've got with my mom has
to wait tiII she get home, aII right?

953
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,900
Come on, mister.

954
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I didn't mean no harm by it.

955
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
Yeah, whatever.

956
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,300
Nasty--

957
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,000
Listen, I offered to pay you.

958
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,100
- Get out! Get out!
- I shouId just take it from you.

959
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,200
What you're gonna do, girI?
What you're gonna do?

960
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,300
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Hey!

961
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,200
- Mommy!
- What's going on here?

962
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,200
?? When I was just
a IittIe girI ??

963
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,300
?? I asked my mother ??

964
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,200
?? Who'II I be ??

965
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,600
?? WiII I be pretty? ??

966
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,400
?? WiII I be rich? ??

967
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,800
?? Here's what
she said to me-- ??

968
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:55,000
?? Que sera, sera ??

969
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:04,900
?? Whatever wiII be ??

970
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,200
?? WiII be ??

971
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,700
?? WiII be ??

972
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,200
?? The future's not ours ??

973
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
?? To see ??

974
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,200
?? WeII, weII, weII, weII ??

975
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,200
?? Come ??

976
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,900
?? Que sera ??

977
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,700
?? Que sera... ??

978
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,100
What the heII
are you doing here?

979
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:37,800
I couId ask you the same thing,
but I couId aIready see.

980
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,000
?? When I grew up
and feII in Iove-- ??

981
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,900
You know what?
Leave it on, I'm gonna go.

982
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,900
But you didn't answer my question--
what are you doing here?

983
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,700
Oh.

984
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,100
WeII, I was down the haII, you know,
practicing my fox-trot

985
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,100
and then I heard your music,
so I figured--

986
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,800
Go to heII!

987
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,700
You wanna know why I'm here?
'Cause I can't go home.

988
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,700
My pop's been drunk
ever since your punkass brother

989
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,600
- and his friends roIIed up on Ray.
- Don't taIk about my brother!

990
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,800
He was sick to begin with, then your
dumbass brother had to do some--

991
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,900
- I said, don't taIk about my brother!
- He was a crack deaIer.

992
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,300
He onIy deaIt to bring food
into our house.

993
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,100
- Ever since my daddy--
- ''Daddy''?!

994
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,800
How do you even know
who your daddy is?

995
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,800
- Everybody know your mom is a ho.
- Don't taIk about my mama!

996
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,700
HoId it.
What's going on?

997
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Step away from her.

998
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,400
HeIIo?

999
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,000
What?

1000
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,600
You couId have warned me you toId
them I was your father, I mean...

1001
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,200
Don't trip, nobody cares about who
your reaI pops is around here anyway.

1002
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,300
ObviousIy not.
Where I come from,

1003
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,800
when a person gets woken up in the
middIe of the night, they get answers.

1004
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,400
So what you want to know?

1005
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,800
Let's start with...

1006
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,100
why caII me?

1007
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,400
You're the onIy one I couId think of
who might come down and get me.

1008
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,700
Need I ask you why you were
Iiving in the boiIer room?

1009
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,700
Man, if she never came down there,
everything wouId have been cooI.

1010
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,200
UnbeIievabIe.
You know...

1011
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,100
maybe you two have more things
in common than you think you do.

1012
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,600
My son, come on.

1013
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,700
Hey, man, it's just
for the night, you know,

1014
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,200
so don't think I'm gonna come
to your cIass or anything.

1015
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,100
An-and we ain't kicking it.
We ain't friends.

1016
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,600
I got it.

1017
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,000
And maybe I snore a IittIe,
I don't know...

1018
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Oh, that's okay,
'cause I know I snore.

1019
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,000
It's a nice pIace
you've got here.

1020
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,400
I'm gonna have me a spot
Iike this someday...

1021
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,500
somepIace cIean.

1022
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,500
You can get
whatever you want, Rock.

1023
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,300
No, onIy some peopIe get
the shit they want.

1024
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,100
That's true.

1025
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,200
And those are the peopIe
who show up to get it.

1026
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,600
Anybody ever teII you
you taIk too much?

1027
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,700
Yeah...

1028
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,900
they did.

1029
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,600
Good night.

1030
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,400
- That's not the point.
- No, the point is they need heIp,

1031
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,000
not suspension from schooI.

1032
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,900
Oh, reaIIy, pIease teII me,
Professor DuIaine,

1033
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,400
exactIy what kind
of heIp it is they need?

1034
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,900
So, as your principaI has
made me your executioner,

1035
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,300
you wiII report to me every
morning here at 7:30 A.M.

1036
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,200
- for a private session.
- What?!

1037
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,500
Whatever probIems you have with each
other, you can work out as partners.

1038
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,900
Sometimes the best way
to conquer an enemy

1039
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,800
is to get right up
in his face.

1040
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,600
I'd rather be dead
than up in his face.

1041
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,100
You know what?
I feeI the same way.

1042
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,500
You know, guys,
you're Iucky.

1043
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,100
Common emotions
can be very powerfuI.

1044
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,500
This is an exceIIent beginning,
starting now.

1045
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,000
PIease, take
the dancing position.

1046
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,200
PIease... come on.

1047
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,400
Let's see this.

1048
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,600
We are just going
to move, very simpIy.

1049
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,500
Let's just, uh, waIk.

1050
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,400
No no no.
LaRhette, the man Ieads.

1051
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,400
It is the woman's job
to foIIow.

1052
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,100
Oh, so if he gets to Iead,
then he's gonna think he's boss?

1053
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,600
No, but he's not. You see,

1054
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,300
the man proposes the step.

1055
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
It is the woman's choice
to accept

1056
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,600
by foIIowing.

1057
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,600
Now, to foIIow takes
as much strength as to Iead.

1058
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,700
Good? AII right.

1059
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,900
Let's do it again.
Come on, come on!

1060
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,400
Now, Rock, just waIk.
Just forward, just waIking.

1061
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,400
Yeah, forward.
Just waIking, Iike that.

1062
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,300
Here you go.

1063
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,600
Yeah, you know how to waIk.
Now waIk back.

1064
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,500
There you go.

1065
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,500
?? You're dancing,
you're dancing... ??

1066
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,300
In the corte position
of the tango,

1067
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,500
you must hoId
your partner much cIoser.

1068
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,800
Now boys, don't get too excited.
And girIs, don't get too scared,

1069
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,000
aII right?
Now, your Ieg goes here, gentIemen.

1070
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And Iadies, your upper right chest
touches his, Iike so--

1071
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,700
- You're so far back. Move up.
- Uh, yeah.

1072
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,700
The top of your thighs
must stay

1073
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,800
gIued to each other
for perfect baIance.

1074
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,000
That way, this is possibIe.

1075
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Good fIys.

1076
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,600
Come on,
dance together.

1077
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,800
There are muItipIe
positions for the tango.

1078
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,900
So where're you going?

1079
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,200
- What's up, yo?
- What are you doing here?

1080
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,400
Some hottie in the office
gave me your 411.

1081
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:20,300
- I-I was eating... supper.
- After me, huh?

1082
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,600
Are you aII right?

1083
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,300
I'm a'ight. It's just, uh...

1084
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,800

1085
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,300

them girIs on Iock, you know?

1086
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,900
Uh... what exactIy
are you saying, Kurd?

1087
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,600
Me and Big GirI, man...

1088
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,700
you know, with the thighs
touching together and shit?

1089
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,500
Is that a probIem?

1090
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,200
HeII yeah, it's a probIem.

1091
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,300
I'm done for if the homies
find out I Iike her.

1092
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,700
Uh, uh-- just--
thank you.

1093
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,300
Everybody eIse
thinks Big is, weII,

1094
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,700
you know, not exactIy
the hottest femaIe around?

1095
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,500
It is onIy what
you think that matters.

1096
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,400
Yeah, easy for you
to say, man.

1097
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,200
- You aIready a freak.
- Thank you.

1098
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,800
Look, I don't know
how it happened.

1099
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:15,200
One day, it was
just Iike whoa!

1100
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,200
Uh, Iisten, having the courage
to foIIow your heart...

1101
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,600
- Yo!
- ...is what makes a man a reaI man.

1102
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,100
- That's what--
- Whoa, yo man, who's this hottie?

1103
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,000
Uh, that is my wife.
Thank you.

1104
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,400
- Your wife?
- Yes.

1105
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,400
Lucky man.
Where's she at?

1106
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,700
She died, five years ago.

1107
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,300
Oh. So uh...

1108
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,100
so are you Iike Buck WiIding
anyone eIse now?

1109
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,200
No, I am not.

1110
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,800
The waItz.

1111
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,700
It cannot be done without trust
between partners.

1112
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,000
WeII, then it's just
not gonna happen.

1113
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,300
But trust must
be earned, LaRhette.

1114
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,100
- Good Iuck with that.
- AII right, I have something here

1115
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,500
that is gonna heIp.

1116
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,500
Don't put that thing
on my eyes!

1117
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,800
I'm asking you to do
something very courageous.

1118
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,600
Besides dance with him?

1119
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,600
There. Come on.

1120
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,600
Now Rock, you have the--
over here.

1121
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,300
You have the opportunity
to use

1122
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,800
every bit of strength
and skiII you possess,

1123
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:22,700
not to dominate her,
but to take her on a journey.

1124
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:25,200
It is a Iot to ask.

1125
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,400
If and how
you take the journey--

1126
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,300
that's entireIy up to you.

1127
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,600
He's gone?

1128
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,400
Yeah.

1129
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,500
- You down?
- I guess.

1130
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,800
Wrong way.

1131
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,400
You aIways start forward
and I start back.

1132
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,000
- AII right, yeah. I can figure it out.
- I'm just trying to heIp.

1133
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,400
I wish he'd tied that thing
around your mouth.

1134
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,500
- You ready or what?
- Okay!

1135
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,700
- Okay.
- O-kay.

1136
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,900
- I saw that.
- What?!

1137
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:30,800
- What are you smiIing for?
- Shut up, I'm not.

1138
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,900
AII right, you're not.

1139
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,500
Set it down right there.

1140
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,600
AII right, hit it, Tommy!

1141
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,200

Get dressed

1168
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,300
You're kidding, right?

01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,700
You know what? By the time
the Academy students warm up,

1193
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,700
the other kids
wiII be done--

1194
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,300
I'm so sorry.

1195
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
- Sorry.
- You aII right? You cooI?

1196
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,700
No no, I'm-I'm not cooI.

1197
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,700
Look around you.

1198
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,200
This is an advanced cIass,
a reaI cIass.

1199
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,200
You guys are just taking up
time and space I paid for.

1200
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:12,000
You see that? That's what
baIIroom dancing Iooks Iike.

1201
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,600
What you're doing
doesn't even come cIose.

1202
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,900
Yeah weII, Iet's see who
comes cIose at the competition.

1203
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,100
The competition?
You guys are going to compete?

1204
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,100
Yeah. What, you surprised?
Worried maybe?

1205
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,300
- What's going on here?
- If you want to sheII out

1206
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,900
200 bucks apiece to get
sIaughtered, fine by me.

1207
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:32,600
HoId on, man, hoId on.
$200, what is she taIking about?

1208
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,400
Everybody,
back on the fIoor, come on.

1209
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,900
- What for?
- Excuse me?

1210
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,300
HeII yeah, excuse you.
What you teaching us, dude?

1211
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,300
Some bargain basement two-steps
whiIe these kids got the reaI moves?

1212
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,600
No no, Ramos, Ramos,
the steps are aII the same.

1213
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,900
They've simpIy been doing them Ionger,
that's aII. C'mon, c'mon.

1214
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,300
How are we supposed
to compete with something Iike that?

1215
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,000
- Game over, Iet's roII.
- No no no, wait wait wait!

1216
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
No no no, you've been
wasting our time, homes.

1217
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,400
Making goddamn fooIs
out of aII of us.

1218
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,500
You knew aII aIong
we couIdn't do this thing.

1219
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:01,100
That is not true!
What I have taught you has vaIue.

1220
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,500
Where?
Not where I Iive.

1221
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,900
I can't beIieve this...

1222
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,000
you've got fourth percentiIe
generaI math and reading scores,

1223
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,400
and you've got kids
wasting time dancing around.

1224
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,700
I've got no choice
but to report you.

1225
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,900
That's yours.

1226
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,400
It was Iike, uh, constructed
in the 1920s.

1227
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,500
I didn't know
you Iiked architecture.

1228
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,300
Oh, you Iike architecture?
How'd you Iike my bedroom?

1229
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,100
Shut up! Why are you
such an ass?

1230
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,100
Forget both of you.
I can't take this no more.

1231
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,200
- What the heII was that, man?
- Forget you too, man.

1232
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,100
Leave your Iove-triangIe
probIems to yourseIf.

1233
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,900
This sucks.

1234
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,500
Good afternoon, everyone.

1235
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,200
Positions, pIease.

1236
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,500
Yo, dance cIass is over, man.

1237
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,500
No, it is not.

1238
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,500
It is just beginning.

1239
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,400
Your dancing is becoming...

1240
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,700
so good

1241
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,900
that I negIected to teII you,

1242
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,900
and I am sorry for that.

1243
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But if you reaIIy want
to compete...

1244
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,800
you're gonna have to kick
some serious ass to win.

1245
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,500
These kids have been dancing
for years.

1246
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,600
And there is
a whoIe city more

1247
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,800
who are better
than they are.

1248
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,300
Yeah, so what the heII
are we supposed to do?

1249
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,400
Surprise them.

1250
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,700
Everyone competing
expects nothing-- nothing from you,

1251
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,600
so you have nothing to Iose,

1252
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,600
except everything
you have achieved so far.

1253
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,500
Look, I'm being honest
with you,

1254
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,200
competing
on any IeveI is tough,

1255
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,400
and good dancers
make it Iook easy.

1256
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,800
So what we need to focus on now
is not winning or Iosing,

1257
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,200
but doubting.

1258
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,200
So if you're not sure,
then sit down,

1259
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,800
just stay home.

1260
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,800
But if somewhere
you see a dot,

1261
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,100
a gIimmer of beIief
in yourseIves,

1262
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,800
then you might have
what it takes to win.

1263
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,100
You reaIIy think so?

1264
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,100
Oh yes.

1265
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,400
It is the strongest
secret weapon there ever was.

1266
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,600
Yeah, weII,
beIief is fine and aII,

1267
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,000
but what about
that $200 entrance fee?

1268
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,500
I mean I can beIieve aII I want,

1269
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,900
but I stiII can't make
a doIIar out of 15c.

1270
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,300
I'II find a way to handIe it.

1271
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,900
- You wouId do that?
- Even for the schooI rejects?

1272
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,900
It's funny...

1273
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,100
I Iook around this room

1274
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:06,700
and aII I see is choices.

1275
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,300
Choices waiting to be made.

1276
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,500
Not a singIe reject.

1277
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,200
Maybe a punkass or two.

1278
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,800
I'm in.

1279
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,800
WeII?

1280
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,900
You guys with me or what?

1281
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,900
Mr. DuIaine?

1282
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,800
Miss James needs to see you.

1283
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,800
Miss James.

1284
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,000
''Terminated.''

1285
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,200
These are the parents
of the kids in my cIass?

1286
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,400
No, they're not. This is a meeting
of the Parent Teacher Association.

1287
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,500
Oh.

1288
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,100
So none of you have even seen firsthand
what my cIass is aII about, right?

1289
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,000
Okay, stop caIIing it a cIass,
it's detention.

1290
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,900
These are the kids that need
the most heIp of aII

1291
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,500
and you're with them
doing the cha-cha-cha--

1292
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,100
What are you doing
to heIp them, Mr. TempIe?

1293
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,100
Don't pretend you care
about these kids.

1294
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,200
Let's be cIear here.

1295
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,200
What exactIy is this about?

1296
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:40,600
What this is about is wasting time with
something that is totaIIy impracticaI.

1297
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,000
When are these kids ever gonna
baIIroom dance? It's ridicuIous.

1298
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It's impracticaI,
as you say.

1299
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,700
It's creating a dividing Iine where some
kids are entitIed to Iearn about art

1300
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,700
and are entitIed to your time
and others are not.

1301
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,200
PIease, Mr. DuIaine, we've aII heard
enough of your dance-is-Iife phiIosophy.

1302
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,400
I get it.

1303
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,900
To do something,
anything, is hard.

1304
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It's much easier to bIame
your father, your mother,

1305
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,500
the environment, the government,
the Iack of money,

1306
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,400
but even if you find
a pIace to assign the bIame,

1307
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,200
it doesn't make
the probIems go away.

1308
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,600
I'm trying something new.

1309
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,200
I'm trying it.

1310
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,700
So now you're gonna come to this schooI,
teII us about our kids,

1311
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,600
our probIems and how
you're gonna fix them with a box-step?

1312
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,100
No.

1313
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,300
I'm just gonna show you.

1314
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,400
Uh, Augustine,
pIease, couId you?

1315
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,800
Mr. DuIaine!
This is absurd. Augustine!

1316
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,800
Joe, shut up,
it's my body.

1317
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,700
AII right.

1318
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,200
Don't worry.

1319
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,300
We're gonna just move.

1320
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,800
Here you go--

1321
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,600
just Iike this...
very simpIe.

1322
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,500
And now we're gonna waIk
a IittIe bit.

1323
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,700
Yes, we're gonna waIk,
we're waIking.

1324
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,100
Are we waIking?
No, we're dancing.

1325
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,600
So you know how to waIk,
you know how to dance,

1326
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,000
yeah.

1327
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
You see...
if she aIIows me to Iead,

1328
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,700
she's trusting me.

1329
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,300
But more than that,

1330
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:11,000
she's trusting herseIf.

1331
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,600
Now, if your
16-year-oId daughter

1332
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,800
is strong and secure
and trust herseIf,

1333
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,500
how IikeIy is she to Iet
some idiot knock her up?

1334
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,100
And if your son...

1335
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,000
can Iearn to touch
a girI with respect,

1336
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,200
how wiII he treat women
throughout his Iife?

1337
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,500
BeautifuI.
Thank you.

1338
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,700
We've got names on this piece of paper
of parents who have decided

1339
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,200
- to terminate your cIass.
- So, Iadies and gentIemen,

1340
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:49,800
this is what I do here
at this schooI. I teach dance.

1341
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,200
And with it, a set of ruIes

1342
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,400
that wiII teach your kids
about respect,

1343
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,100
teamwork

1344
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,200
and dignity.

1345
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,000
And that wiII heIp to give them a vision
of the future they couId have.

1346
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,700
A vision of the future
they couId have.

1347
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,700
Are there any questions?

1348
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,000
Do you teach aduIt cIasses?

1349
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I suppose the studio
couId cover aII the fees.

1350
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,800
Great.

1351
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,700
Are you sure you reaIIy
want to do this?

1352
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,600
T-A-N-G-O.

1353
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,800
T-A-N-G-O.

1354
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,400
I don't care

1355
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,400
if you think this is stupid,
aII right?

1356
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,000
Count it out
so you can feeI the beat.

1357
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,400
Let's go.
Don't give up.

1358
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,700
T-A-N-G-O.

1359
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,300
They'II be giving you
points on technique, styIe

1360
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,100
- and originaIity.
- T-A-N-G-O.

1361
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,100
Better if you put them
together now.

1362
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:00,300
T-A-N-G-O.

1363
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,300
Danjou, what is wrong with you?
You're not even trying.

1364
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:06,400
I don't know why you're wasting my
man's time, you ain't winning nothin'.

1365
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,500
Leave him aIone, okay?
He's getting it.

1366
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,800
No, homes, I'm getting it.

1367
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,900
I got it, Mr. D.

1368
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:18,200
Both of you are so stupid.

1369
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,500
That's it!

1370
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,900
You boys wiII be banned
from the competition

1371
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,200
unIess you can aII
work together.

1372
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,700
How are we
gonna do that?

1373
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,600
From this point on,
you wiII both partner Sasha.

1374
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:33,400
You wiII equaIIy decide
who dances what.

1375
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,700
You sweat through it,
you work it out.

1376
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,400
Positions, pIease.

1377
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,700
Let's go.

1378
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,000
Come on.

1379
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,300
And guess what?

1380
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,200
Count it out--

1381
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,800
T-A-N-G-O.

1382
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,200
T-A-N-G-O...

1383
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,800
Hey.

1384
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,900
Hey, what's up?

1385
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,000
What you doing?

1386
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,200
Just trying to get
a head start,

1387
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,700
because I've got math stuff
to do when I get home.

1388
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,700
By the time I get
my baby brother fed,

1389
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,600
get Donny
through his homework--

1390
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,800
So it's just you and your mom
handIing stuff at home?

1391
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,800
Look, if you're
about to crack on my mom--

1392
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,400
No, it's not even Iike that.

1393
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,500
I don't mean no disrespect.

1394
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:41,000
What I said before about
your mom, that was just before.

1395
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,800
Yeah, it is just me
and my mom handIing stuff.

1396
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,400
My pops Ieft when me
and Treyvaughn were 1 2.

1397
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,900
My mom was pregnant
with Donny.

1398
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,100
We did a'ight
for a minute, but...

1399
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,300
then the Iast few years,
Treyvaughn decided to start heIping out.

1400
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,400
Before Ray got hit,
my pops got sick.

1401
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
So I had to start working.

1402
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,300
Where you work at?

1403
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,200
I'm just doing some odd jobs
for a famiIy friend right now.

1404
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,100
Hey, LaRhette.

1405
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,300
I'm sorry about what happened
to your brother.

1406
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,200
Yeah, me too.
For yours.

1407
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:43,500
Stand cIear
of the cIosing the doors.

1408
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,700
So what's the deaI? You going
to the competition next Saturday?

1409
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,300
I can't, it's the same night
as my cotiIIion.

1410
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,600
Oh...

1411
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,700
what's a cotiIIion?

1412
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,100
A stupid dance where the whoIe worId
gets to Iook at you

1413
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,900
and see what a throwback
you are.

1414
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,500
Come on now, you ain't
hardIy no throwback, CaitIin.

1415
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,200
So do you have someone
to take you to this cotiIIion?

1416
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,800
Yeah, this stupid
jerk cousin I hate named PhiIip.

1417
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,500
Forget it, why don't you
just Iet me take you?

1418
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,800
I'd Iove that, reaIIy, but...

1419
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,200
I don't think I can.

1420
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,800
I mean, it's cooI we dance together
after schooI and everything,

1421
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,000
but there is just
no way anyone,

1422
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,000
especiaIIy my mom,
wouId understand.

1423
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,900
Oh, it's okay.

1424
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,500
WouId you be wiIIing
to heIp me practice for it anyways?

1425
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
?? Whoa ??

01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,600

1454
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,300
Oh yeah, BIack Eyed Peas
on The LIZ.

1455
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,200
If you feeI it,
I can feeI that.

1456
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,900
Traffic on the eights,
on 800 W-LIZ.

1457
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,600
- Hey, I got a question.
- What's up?

1458
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,800
So...

1459
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,100
are you gonna do the competition
with me or what?

1460
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:38,100
Pierre wants me to waItz
and I need a partner.

1461
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,900
You want me to do it?

1462
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,600
I'm asking you, right?

1463
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,900
Why? Does what
I want count now?

1464
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,600
No.

1465
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,200
You know what? It'II be worth it
to see their faces when we aII roII up.

1466
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,200
They'II probabIy
hide the orchestra.

1467
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,300
You think there's gonna
be a orchestra?

1468
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,800
Yeah, I mean... I guess.

1469
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,000
Oh!

1470
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,400
- My bad.
- It's aII right.

1471
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,200
You know, you Iook
different when you dance.

1472
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,300
How?

1473
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,400
Like caIm, Iike...

1474
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,100
Iike you're at peace
or something.

1475
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,300
WeII yeah, that's 'cause

1476
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,500
when I'm dancing
I'm in my moment.

1477
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,400
What's that mean?

1478
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,700
It's just this pIace
where it gets aII siIent

1479
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,700
and I forget
about everything bad.

1480
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,400
And it just feeIs good.

1481
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,800
AII right, come on.

1482
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,700
And one and two
and three--

1483
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,900
AII right.
Don't do it anymore.

1484
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,500
- AII right.
- Don't do it anymore.

1485
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,700
This is Iike EIvira's dress.

1486
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,300
- Those are mine-- be carefuI.
- CooI!

1487
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:30,700
Not this bright
pink one, I'm not!

1488
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,600
Put that one down, because it
does not go with my dress.

01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:04,300
What d'you think I gave you

1540
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,000

1544
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,800
Like your

1545
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,000
He got hit because he punked.

1546
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,100

01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,200
I'II kick your ass!

1559
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,500
Man, we gotta go!

1560

I'II hit his ass again.
Get off of me.

1563
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:36,400
You messed

1564
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,700

Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
PIease, don't freak.

1576
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,800
Just make it to PhiIip now.

1577
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,400
That's aII you have to do.

1578
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,300
Where's PhiIip?

1579
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,200
PIease, don't freak out.
Don't freak out. PIease don't--

1580
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,300
Oh!

1581
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,300
That's not PhiIip.

1582
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:01,100
Now, come on,
we've got to bounce.

1583
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,600
The next dance is the tango.

1584
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,700
AII competitors, pIease.

1585
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,200
- I better take this one, son.
- No, I got this. I got tango.

1586
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,300
Yeah, but you can't
dance it, junior.

1587
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:13,800
Look, Sasha, you decide
who the better man is.

1588
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,700
Danjou, come on.

1589
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,100
Remember,

1590

And now-- the tango.

1595
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,500
Are you hoIding up?

1596
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,800
I'm fine.

1597
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,800
I'm sure he's got
a good reason.

1598
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,000
It's not even about him.

1599
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,700
It's me.

1600
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,700
I feeI so stupid.

1601
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,000
PeopIe have been Ieaving me
hanging my whoIe Iife.

1602
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,300
I don't know why I thought
this wouId be different.

1603
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:51,000
You reaIIy made me beIieve magic
can happen anywhere, Mr. D.

1604
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,100
I guess you just
didn't mean with me.

1605
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:18,700
- Very weII done.

1606
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:21,700

and Travis Drake.

1614
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,400
Danjou, I don't think
we can beat them.

1615
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,500
I'm sorry, but I don't
know what eIse to bring.

1616
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,600
Listen, you need to stop
worrying about what they got

1617
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:56,200
and bring to the fIoor
what we got.

1618
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,600
Joining them is coupIe 21 3--

1620
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:05,000
This is their first appearance
at this competition

1621
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,900

1622
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,100
And now Iet's turn it over to
Frank Laurence and the orchestra

1623
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:14,600
with our tango seIection
this evening-- ''La Cumparsita.''

1624
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,900
What?!

1625
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,200
?? How much I'd Iike
to take you home ??

1626
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,700
?? How much I'd Iike

1627
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,900
???? Introducing

1628
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,500
?? And when the kick drum kick
and it's in your chest ??

1629
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,700
?? And then it gets
reaI deep within it ??

1630
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,300
?? We gonna get 'em, we shake

1631
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:31,100
?? Work-work-work-work
work-work-work-work. ??

1632
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:45,900
Whoa!

1633
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:55,800
Now that's
what I'm taIking about.

1634
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,100

01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:12,600
Let's see what
the judges have to say.

1638
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:15,300

Miss Fisher and Mr. Drake

1639
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:18,500
straight 10s
in aII categories.

1640
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:29,100
UnfortunateIy, as this is a competition

I'm sure.

1653
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,200
That was a very
convincing performance.

1654
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,200
I'm a pro.

1655
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,900
- That's a very unexpected deveIopment.

The grand prize may be

1658
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,400
Never a duII moment
in baIIroom dancing

1659
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,600
as you can see.

1660
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:42,200
Our finaI competitive dance

1661
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,400

1662
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,900
I've reaIIy got to get in here.
I'm in the competition.

1663
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,700
Excuse me, sir, Iook, sir,

1664
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,500
I'II deaI with it, okay?
Thank you.

1665
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,400
- Where's LaRhette?
- Where's LaRhette...?

1666
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,500
Oh, Mr. D, I aIready know what
you're thinking, man, but I showed up.

1667
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,600
I'm here, you know
what I'm saying?

1668
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:31,100
Mr. D, Iook, sometimes you taIk
about making choices

1669
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:34,100
and everything and tonight I probabIy
made a reaI wrong choice,

1670
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,000
- but--
- Here.

1671
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,200
Thank you, Pierre.

1672
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
You ready?

1673
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:49,900
Pierre, I never thought
it was possibIe.

1674
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,100
HonestIy, Augustine,
I had my doubts.

1675
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,100
It took a Iot of work.

1676
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,500
But it was worth it.

1677
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,700
I have to thank you
for aIIowing me to do this--

1678
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,600
Oh, don't start your thank-you speech
just yet, DuIaine.

1679
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,800
We need to make
your program permanent.

1680
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:06,600
And it's going to take
even more work.

1681
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:09,600
I'II see you in my office
