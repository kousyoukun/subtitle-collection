00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,197
I do not wanna have to see
your drawers. Good morning.

158
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:34,134
Chin, if I see you on that cell
phone one more time, it's mine.

159
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,369
Eddie French, in my office,
you know why.

160
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,206
Augustine, have you made a
decision yet on my calculus lab?

161
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,275
Joe, do you think I get special
funding for your six kids

162
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,912
when I have the rest
of them to worry about?

163
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,947
My six have a chance.
They're smarter than--

164
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,216
You know how I feel
about "smarter than".

165
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,952
There's kids selling drugs,
doing calculus in their heads.

166
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,022
If you wanna open up that
lab to the rest of them

167
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,024
maybe we could swing a grant.

168
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,027
- Yes, I'm serious.

169
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,163
We have to honor the kids that
are excelling, not neglect them.

170
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,233
Joe, we operate on limited
resources. Morning, Gretchen.

171
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,070
Look, I need these, like..

172
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,305
At a couple of
different places

173
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,573
is that gonna be..

174
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,909
Yo, son, who died?

175
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,913
Apparently,
good manners.

176
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,184
Excuse me, sir.
Was that lady the principal?

177
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,255
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

178
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,223
Uh-huh.

179
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,993
You mean,
"You're welcome," right?

180
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,095
Uh-huh.

181
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,539
What's this I hear about you
bailing out on detention today?

182
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,910
I'm not giving up my math club
time to babysit delinquents.

183
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,645
Excuse me, those kids need
your attention as well.

184
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,115
But the ones who try
actually deserve it.

185
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,869
Yo, son, what the hell
you do that for?

186
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,370
She wasn't carrying nothin'.

187
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,240
She coulda opened the door
her damn self.

188
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,075
It's called courtesy.

189
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,511
Yeah, well, it makes you
look like a punk-ass.

190
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,147
- Damn straight.

191
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,283
Punk-ass moves like that won't
get you no play around here.

192
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,420
- Trust me, I've tried it.
- Oh, I got plenty of play.

193
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,491
You kiddin', right?

194
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,907
Did you see that?

195
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:57,144
Every single one of them
smiled at me.

196
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,512
Yeah, but you didn't
get no numbers.

197
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,949
I didn't ask
for no numbers.

198
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,954
Whatever.

199
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,057
'What about Kline? He hasn't
taken detention in months.'

200
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,025
- I wonder what the--

201
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,394
- Jury duty.
'

202
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,529
What are you looking at?

203
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,498
Mr. Dulaine.

204
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,668
- Too early to say.

205
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,337
'But check this out.'

206
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,840
He's been doing that
for everyone.

207
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,677
And he stands every time
a woman walks past.

208
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,680
Freak. It's just my luck.

209
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,449
'Have security standing by.'

210
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,651
Mr. Dulaine.

211
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,320
Come on in.

212
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,898
Eddie, sit your ass down.

213
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,135
Please.

214
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,004
What can I do for you?

215
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,506
You're not a parent,
you're not a sub

216
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,408
you're certainly not a cop.

217
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,910
How can you tell all this?

218
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,379
If I depended on the students
to tell me what was going on

219
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,150
we'd all be in trouble. I got
five minutes, Mr. Dulaine.

220
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,584
Yeah, um..

221
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,988
I ran into one of your
students on, uh, Saturday night.

222
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,024
- How nice for you.
- Yeah.

223
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,059
He was vandalizing
private property.

224
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,860
Did you file
a police report?

225
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,896
No.

226
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,731
I though I should
come to you.

227
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,567
It's the wrong move. I try to
prevent crime from happening.

228
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:31,304
But once it does, the police
are who you wanna talk to.

229
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,007
So...good day.

230
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,144
That's it?

231
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,813
That's it for me.
Gretchen will show you out.

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,750
Oh, oh, oh,
hold on, uh..

233
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,319
Who should I talk to
about this?

234
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,757
Probably one
of your students, right?

235
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,593
You must have a lot
of angry kids at this school.

236
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,129
If your kids were
as important as your car--

237
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,431
Excuse me for caring
about my car, Mr. Dulaine.

238
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,934
And do not talk to me
about angry kids

239
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,669
like you are some
kind of expert.

240
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,906
This is my school. I decide
what is or is not a priority.

241
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:10,944
And these kids?
Are they your priorities?

242
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,279
Honor roll?

243
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,481
Those kids are dead,
Mr. Dulaine.

244
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,550
'Each and every one of them
killed since I have been here.'

245
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,920
I keep them right there
to remind me of why I'm tired

246
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,423
and why I keep
coming to work

247
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,925
and why I have
no time to waste.

248
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,894
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

249
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,263
Please excuse me.

250
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,268
- I would like to help.

251
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,706
There are numerous ways
community members

252
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,142
can help the students
of John Drake High School.

253
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,144
There's a Tutoring Program.
There's Big Brothers.

254
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,279
There's the Math Center,
the Language Skills Lab

255
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,348
Book Club,
DARE outreach.

256
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,683
Y-yeah, I-I'm sure
these are fine programs.

257
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,987
Uh...but I have
my own methods.

258
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,589
Alright, um..

259
00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:00,927
I want to teach
your kids to dance.

260
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,231
Believe me, the one thing
they do know is how to dance.

261
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,768
He said, "ballroom."

262
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,672
Uh, yeah.
Waltz, fox-trot.

263
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,973
'All the classics.'

264
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,344
It would be great for them.

265
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,313
Okay, where is the camera?

266
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,583
If you are talking about
teaching my kids the fox-trot

267
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,618
I must be on television.

268
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,155
Alright, um..

269
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,058
Your kids, your call.

270
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,693
Thank you.

271
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,395
Good morning.

272
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,602
Mr. Dulaine! Wait.

273
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,505
If you are serious..

274
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,774
...I just might have
an opening for you.

275
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,410
You meet me back here
at three o'clock sharp.

276
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,811
Three?

277
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,047
I'm not a particularly
patient woman, Mr. Dulaine.

278
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,083
Either you wanna
help out or you don't.

279
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,451
I'll rearrange my schedule.

280
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,161
I see you sneaking out
on me, Joe L.

281
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,929
We have kids in there
for everything

282
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,832
from stealing someone's bag,
to cheating on exams..

283
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:13,966
Hector, home safe.

284
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,768
...to possession, vandalism

285
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,605
to rearranging somebody's face.
Basically, if you..

286
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,207
Hat! Hat!

287
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,076
If you think of ways to cut
corners and collect dimes

288
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,112
these kids in detention
are all over it

289
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,546
before we've had
our morning coffee.

290
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,149
- You said you wanted to help.

291
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,684
Believe me,
these kids could use some.

292
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,087
'Everyone else calls them
the school rejects.'

293
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,323
'They're in here
for the rest of the term.'

294
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,558
'In case you were wondering
why the scenic tour?'

295
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,593
Detention's far
from a beauty spot

296
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,629
but it's the only space
we have available

297
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,998
after some knucklehead
burned up the Study Hall.

298
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,834
On purpose?

299
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,738
I have five bucks say
you won't be back tomorrow.

300
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,519
'Miss James.'

301
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,955
What, you springing us
for good behavior or something?

302
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,590
No, I'm not, Mr. Epps.

303
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,226
Listen up, everybody,
this is Mr. Dulaine.

304
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,695
Mr. Dulaine here is
running your detention

305
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,298
and you will do
whatever Mr. Dulaine says.

306
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,367
That's what you think.

307
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,702
- 'Yeah, right.'
- They're all yours.

308
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,541
'Hey, give me,
give me the ball.'

309
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,043
- 'Let's go, man.'
- Pow! Right there.

310
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,780
Yo, follow that queen.
Let's go.

311
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,849
Pay attention,
pay attention.

312
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,618
- Okay.
- Like this..

313
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:42,021
My name is, uh,
Pierre Dulaine.

314
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,258
But, uh,
you can call me, Pierre.

315
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,527
- You don't sound French.

316
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,897
Yeah, uh,
my mother was Spanish

317
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,565
'my father was French.'

318
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,534
I understand
six languages.

319
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,403
- 'I speak five.'
- Give me that.

320
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,805
All of them
with a Spanish accent.

321
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,844
Um, so...you are?

322
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,488
Sir.

323
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,993
It's Jason Rockwell.

324
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,432
'Yeah, but you
can call him Rock, Pierre.'

What about you,
mademoiselle?

326
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,070
LaRhette.
LaRhette Dudley.

327
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,172
Very nice
to meet you, LaRhette.

328
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,741

teacher are you?

329

What'd you do
they made you run detention?

330

- I asked to be here.
- Punk-ass move number two.

331
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,949
I teach, uh,
ballroom dancing.

332
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,685
- Ballroom dancing.

333
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:49,456
And you...are going to learn
ballroom dancing

334
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,890
here in your detention.

335
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,199
Nothing this wild
ever happens in English.

336
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,734
Or biology.

337
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,737
The wildest thing yet
is that I said yes.

338
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,205
You did what?

339
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:09,075
I am gonna arrange you
by height.

340
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:13,480
You...and you.
Yeah. Together.

341
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,015
- No freakin' way.
- 'Ooh!'

342
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,786
'Mr. Epps, was it?
And the lady to your right.'

343
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:23,290
Let's have you and you together.
You two together.

344
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,925
Hol-hold on a sec.
Why can't I be with her?

345
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,560
Not at this time, sir.

346
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,029
Yeah, bu-but everybody know
Danjou can't dance.

347
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,564
Are you a dancer, sir?

348
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,633
What, tu nosabes?
I can shake it.

349
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,504
Then I suggest you shake it
with the partner I assigned.

350
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,539
Look, nobody wanted to host
the detention hall.

351
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,140
'This is a joke.'

352
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:45,011
If I turn it over to him, we get
our detention halls for free.

353
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,913
Detention is a place
where the kids

354
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,749
who need to spend extra time
in school do just that.

355
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,919
Spend extra time in school.
Not dancing around.

356
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,954
Joe, do you know
any of our students

357
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,189
that are gonna want
to do ballroom dancing?

358
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,493
- Absolutely not.
- Exactly.

359
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,929
I think I just discovered
the cure for cutting class

360
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,799
and for cheating and for any
number of miscreant behaviors.

You and, uh, yes,
you, together.

364
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,575
Hold up, that's my cousin.
I can't dance with my cousin.

365
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,109
- Yeah, man.

366
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,079
Me and Big Girl can switch.
I'll dance with Monster.

Oh, no, man!

You, sir, will be with
this lovely lady over here.

369

- No, he won't.

- Alright.

373

I'm outta here, son.

379
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,518
Alright, we are
finished for today.

380
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,574
Ah!

381
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:27,046
Did you see what happened
to my bike?

382
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:30,383
- Nope.
- "Nope. Nope."

with the lesson schedule?'

'And the new students
and Caitlin's cotillion?'

385
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,690
Morgan always wants
more time before a competition.

386
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:40,192
You can rearrange.
It'll be fine.

387
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,194
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,730
"It'll be fine?"

389
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,933
Just when this place was
starting to do well, Pierre.

390
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,536
These kids probably don't even
want what you're offering.

391
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,070
Did you ask them?

392
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,905
- Mm-mm.

393
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,642
- Pierre, we have an emergency.
- We'll talk about this later.

394
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,111
Ahem, ladies,
what a pleasure.

Hey.

she may be getting worse.

Oh, she'll be fine,

a little time, that's all.

This cotillion is a huge event.

spent a fortune on the party.

not have her looking like a..

403

to feel secure, alright?

00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,102

Caitlin...do you like dancing?

407
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,783
Then you were made
to dance.

408
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:41,120
Mr. Dulaine, I want
to dance more than anything.

409
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:44,557
- It's just...I know I suck.
- No, no.

410

My mom and dad paid
so much for my lessons.

Right there is the problem.

412
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,000
You need to dance for yourself,
not for anybody else.

Just forward, just walking.

Just walking, like that.'

Here you go.

01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,370
you must hold
your partner much closer.

Girls, don't get too scared.

Yeah, easy for you
to say, man.

1120

- You already a freak.
- Thank you.

1121
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,874
Look, I don't know
how it happened.

One day, it was
just like whoa!

1123

Uh, listen, having the courage
to follow your heart

1124

is what makes
a man a real man.

Where's she at?

Oh. So, uh..

No, I'm not.

The waltz.

It cannot be done without
trust between partners.

1135
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,981
Well, then it's just
not gonna happen.

But trust must be
earned, LaRhette.

on my eyes.

Now, Rock, you have
the...over here.

every bit of strength
and skill you possess

1146

not to dominate her

1147
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,213
but to take her
on a journey.

1148
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,650
It is a lot to ask.

1149
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:30,320
If and how you take
the journey..

1150

up to you.

Yeah.

- Okay.

the steps are all the same.

1239
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,769
They've simply been doing them
longer, that's all.

1240
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:48,405
How are we supposed to compete
with something like that?

1241
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:49,839
- Game over, let's roll.
- No, wait!

1242
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,675
No, you've been
wasting our time, homes.

1243
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,977
Making goddamn fools
out of all of us.

1244
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,413
You knew all along
we couldn't do this thing.

1245
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,782
That is not true!

1246
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,785
What I have taught you
has value.

1247
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:04,421
Where?
Not where I live.

1248
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:08,525
Come on.

1249
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:34,884
I can't believe this.

1250
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,687
You've got fourth percentile
general math and reading scores

1251
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:40,356
and you've got kids
wasting time dancing around.

1252
01:12:40,424 --> 01:12:42,892
I've got no choice
but to report you.

1253
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,130
That's yours.

1254
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:55,238
It was like, uh,
constructed in the 1920s.

1255
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,040
I didn't know
you liked architecture.

1256
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,975
- I love it--

1257
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,811
- Shut up! You're such an ass.

1258
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,847
Forget both of you.
Can't take this anymore.

1259
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:05,882
- Forget you too.

1260
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:08,518
Leave your love triangle
problems to yourself.

1261
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:11,488
- This sucks.
- Good afternoon, everyone.

1262
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:16,059
- Positions, please.
- Yo, dance class is over, man.

1263
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,061
No, it is not.

1264
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,329
It is just beginning.

1265
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,099
Your dancing is becoming..

1266
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:24,668
...so good..

1267
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,003
'...that I neglected
to tell you'

1268
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,539
and I am sorry for that.

1269
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:32,909
But if you really
want to compete..

1270
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:35,979
...you're gonna have to kick
some serious ass to win.

1271
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:40,850
These kids have been
dancing for years.

1272
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:45,254
And there is
a whole city more

1273
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:46,690
who are better
than they are.

1274
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,493
Yeah, so what the hell
are we supposed to do?

1275
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:51,194
Surprise them.

1276
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:57,667
Everyone competing expects
nothing, nothing from you.

1277
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,603
'So you have nothing to lose'

1278
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:02,506
'except everything
you have achieved so far.'

1279
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,942
Look, I'm being
honest with you.

1280
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:07,811
Competing on any level
is tough

1281
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:10,246
'and good dancers
make it look easy.'

1282
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:13,917
'So what we need to focus on now
is not winning or losing'

1283
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:16,052
but doubting.

1284
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,088
So if you're not sure,
then sit down.

1285
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:20,590
Just stay home.

1286
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,562
But if somewhere
you see a dot

1287
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:28,498
a glimmer of belief
in yourselves

1288
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:32,068
then you might have
what it takes to win.

1289
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,137
You really think so?

1290
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,872
Oh, yes.

1291
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:39,208
It is the strongest
secret weapon there ever was.

1292
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:41,578
'Yeah, well,
belief is fine and all'

1293
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:45,081
but what about that
$200 entrance fee?

1294
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,382
I can believe all I want

1295
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:49,553
but I still can't make
a dollar out of 15 cents.

1296
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:51,187
I'll find a way
to handle it.

1297
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,761
It's funny.

1298
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:02,899
I look around this room..

1299
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:06,102
...and all I see is choices.

1300
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:11,207
Choices waiting to be made.

1301
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:15,078
Not a single reject.

1302
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:20,416
Maybe a punk ass or two.

1303
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,688
I'm in.

1304
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,493
Well?

1305
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,295
You guys with me or what?

1306
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,687
Mr. Dulaine?

1307
01:15:57,754 --> 01:16:00,990
Miss James needs
to see you.

1308
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,592
Miss James.

1309
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:05,962
Terminated.

1310
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:10,066
These are the parents
of the kids in my class?

1311
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:13,436
No. This is a meeting of the
Parent-Teacher Association.

1312
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,104
Oh.

1313
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:16,940
So none of you
have even seen

1314
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,975
'firsthand what my class
is all about, yes?'

1315
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,878
Okay, stop calling it a class,
it's detention.

1316
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:23,713
These kids need
help most of all

1317
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,048
and you're doing
the cha-cha-cha--

1318
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:29,719
What are you doing
to help them, Mr. Temple?

1319
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:32,889
Don't pretend you care
about these kids.

1320
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:36,292
Let's be clear here.
What exactly is this about?

1321
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:37,927
What this is about

1322
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:40,396
is wasting time with something
that is totally impractical.

1323
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:44,901
When are these kids ever gonna
ballroom dance? It's ridiculous.

1324
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:47,737
It's impractical,
as you say.

1325
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:49,138
It's creating
a dividing line

1326
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:51,174
where some kids are
entitled to learn about

1327
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,510
art and are entitled
to your time and others are not.

1328
01:16:54,577 --> 01:16:58,381
Please, we've heard enough of
your dance-is-life philosophy.

1329
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,218
I get it.

1330
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:05,889
To do something,
anything is hard.

1331
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:08,424
'It's much easier to blame
your father, your mother'

1332
01:17:08,491 --> 01:17:11,260
the environment, the government,
the lack of money

1333
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:14,230
but even if you find
a place to assign the blame

1334
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:18,301
it doesn't make
the problems go away.

1335
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,203
I'm trying something new.

1336
01:17:20,904 --> 01:17:22,338
I'm trying it.

1337
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:24,974
You'll come to this school,
tell us about our kids

1338
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:28,244
our problems and how you're
gonna fix them with a box step?

1339
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,879
No.

1340
01:17:29,946 --> 01:17:33,216
I'm just gonna show you. Uh,
Augustine, please, could you?

1341
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:35,752
Mr. Dulaine!
This is absurd. Augustine!

1342
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:38,587
Joe, shut up.
It's my body.

1343
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:39,689
'Alright.'

1344
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:41,290
'Don't worry.'

1345
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:43,659
We're gonna just move.

1346
01:17:43,727 --> 01:17:44,794
Here you go.

1347
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:47,596
Just like this.
Very simple.

1348
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,632
And now we're gonna
walk a little bit.

1349
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,701
Yes, we're gonna walk,
we're walking.

1350
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:54,003
'Are we walking?
No, we're dancing.'

1351
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:57,473
'So you know how to walk,
you know how to dance.'

1352
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,875
Yeah.

1353
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:02,145
You see,
if she allows me to lead

1354
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:04,748
she is trusting me.

1355
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:07,450
But more than that..

1356
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,920
...she is trusting herself.

1357
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:14,423
Now, if your
16-year-old daughter

1358
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:18,795
'is strong and secure
and trusts herself'

1359
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:23,366
how likely is she to let
some idiot knock her up?

1360
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,101
'And if your son'

1361
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,937
can learn to touch
a girl with respect

1362
01:18:28,004 --> 01:18:31,841
how will he treat women
throughout his life?

1363
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:38,547
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

1364
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:41,684
We've got names on this paper
of parents who have decided--

1365
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:43,319
So, ladies and gentlemen

1366
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:47,423
this is what I do here
at this school.

1367
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,859
I teach dance.

1368
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:51,795
And with it,
a set of rules

1369
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:56,532
that will teach your kids
about respect

1370
01:18:56,599 --> 01:19:00,169
teamwork and dignity.

1371
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,370
And that will help

1372
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:04,207
to give them a vision
of the future they could have.

1373
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:07,944
A vision of the future
they could have.

1374
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:13,049
Are there any questions?

1375
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,351
Do you teach adult classes?

1376
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:23,692
I suppose the studio
could cover all the fees.

1377
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,929
Great.

1378
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:29,966
Are you sure you really
want to do this?

1379
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:33,636
T-A-N-G-O.

1380
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:36,940
T-A-N-G-O.

1381
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:39,075
'I don't care'

1382
01:19:39,142 --> 01:19:41,377
if you think this
is stupid, alright?

1383
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:44,080
Count it out
so you can feel the beat.

1384
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:46,382
Let's go.
Don't give up.

1385
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:49,718
T-A-N-G-O.

1386
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,688
'They'll be giving you
points on technique'

1387
01:19:52,755 --> 01:19:55,058
'style and originality.'

1388
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,193
Better get your program
together now.

1389
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,929
T-A-N-G-O.

1390
01:19:59,996 --> 01:20:03,099
Danjou, what is wrong with you?
You're not even trying.

1391
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,334
I don't know why you're
wasting my man's time.

1392
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:07,370
- You ain't winning nothin'.

1393
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:11,407
- He's getting it.
- No, homes, I'm gettin' it.

1394
01:20:13,009 --> 01:20:14,510
I got it, Mr. D.

1395
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:18,314
Both of you are so stupid.

1396
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:20,116
That's it!

1397
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:24,020
You boys will be banned
from the competition

1398
01:20:24,087 --> 01:20:25,889
unless you can
all work together.

1399
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:27,490
How are we
gonna do that?

1400
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,459
From this point on,
you will both partner Sasha.

1401
01:20:30,526 --> 01:20:33,262
You will equally decide
who dances what.

1402
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:37,200
You sweat through it,
you work it out.

1403
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:40,136
'Positions, please.'

1404
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,740

1405
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:46,910
Come on.

1406
01:20:46,976 --> 01:20:49,612
Guess what?

1407
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:50,846
Count it out.

1408
01:20:50,914 --> 01:20:54,683
T-A-N-G-O.

1409
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:58,221
T-A-N-G-O..

1410
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:08,031
Hey.

1411
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:10,233
Hey, what's up?

1412
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:16,172
What you doing?

1413
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:18,107
Just trying to get
a head start

1414
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:21,911
because I've got math stuff
to do when I get home.

1415
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:24,313
By the time I get
my baby brother fed

1416
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,149
get Donny through
his homework..

1417
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:30,186
So it's just you and your mom
handling stuff at home?

1418
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:32,588
Look, if you're about
to crack on my mom..

1419
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:36,559
No, it's not even like that.
I don't mean no disrespect.

1420
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,463
What I said before about
your mom, that was just before.

1421
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:47,436
Yeah, it is just me
and my mom handling stuff.

1422
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:55,278
My pops left when me
and Treyvaughn were 12.

1423
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:57,846
My mom was pregnant
with Donny.

1424
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,116
We did a'ight
for a minute, but..

1425
01:22:00,183 --> 01:22:02,285
In the last few years

1426
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:04,653
Treyvaughn decided
to start helping out.

1427
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:11,694
Before Ray got hit,
my pops got sick.

1428
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,896
So I had to start working.

1429
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:16,465
Where you work at?

1430
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:19,935
I'm just doing some odd jobs
for a family friend right now.

1431
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,314
Hey, LaRhette.

1432
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:38,021
I'm sorry about what happened
to your brother.

1433
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,456
Yeah, me too.
For yours.

1434
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:54,470
So what's the deal?

1435
01:22:54,537 --> 01:22:57,006
You going to the competition
next Saturday?

1436
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:59,742
I can't, it's the same night
as my cotillion.

1437
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:00,909
Oh..

1438
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,511
What's a cotillion?

1439
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:05,781
A stupid dance where the whole
world gets to look at you

1440
01:23:05,848 --> 01:23:07,616
and see what a throwback
you are.

1441
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:11,787
Come on, now, you ain't
hardly no throwback, Caitlin.

1442
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:15,158
So do you have someone
to take you to this cotillion?

1443
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:18,627
Yeah, this stupid jerk cousin
I hate named Philip.

1444
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:21,730
Forget it, why don't you
just let me take you?

1445
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,636
I'd love that, really, but..

1446
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:29,572
I don't think I can.

1447
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:32,141
I mean, it's cool
we dance together

1448
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,642
after school
and everything

1449
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:37,313
but there is just
no way anyone

1450
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,615
especially my mom,
would understand.

1451
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:43,686
Oh, it's okay.

1452
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:49,425
Would you be willing to help me
practice for it anyways?

So..

Are you gonna do the competition
with me or what?

1492

No.

You know what?

1496
01:25:50,446 --> 01:25:53,216
It'll be worth to see their
faces when we roll up.

1497
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:54,783
They'll probably
hide the orchestra.

1498
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,320
You think there's gonna
be an orchestra?

- My bad.
- It's alright.

01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,724
You know, you look
different when you dance.

On Saturday?
You said this Saturday?

1548
01:29:09,445 --> 01:29:11,447
Yeah, this Saturday, fool.

1549
01:29:16,419 --> 01:29:18,921
- 'Shoot it.'
- 'He's being lazy.'

1550
01:29:18,987 --> 01:29:21,390
'Yo, you playing or what?'

1551
01:29:25,828 --> 01:29:28,397
Get up, get up!

1552
01:29:28,464 --> 01:29:30,032
Game point, game point.

1553
01:29:42,177 --> 01:29:43,712
Nice bike.

1554
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:48,917
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1555
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,321
Good evening and welcome

1556
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:03,091
to the 25th Annual
Grand Ballroom Competition.

1557
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:05,327
'I see many, many
familiar faces here tonight.'

1558
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:07,162
And a whole lot
of new black ones.

1559
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:10,232
'So at this time
if you'd like to warm up'

1560
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:13,335
please take a partner
and join me on the dance floor

1561
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:15,571
for our first all in waltz.

1562
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:16,839
'Our orchestra this evening'

1563
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:18,707
'is under the direction
of Frank Lawrence.'

1564
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:21,677
'Please give them
a very warm welcome.'

1565
01:31:23,779 --> 01:31:25,213
Man, she know she wrong.

1566
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,050
You oughta give it to her
though, the girl is bad.

1567
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:30,385
'

1568
01:31:56,912 --> 01:31:59,815
Yo, Ease.
This don't feel alright, man.

1569
01:31:59,882 --> 01:32:02,217
- If somebody comes--
- You shoot 'em.

1570
01:32:02,284 --> 01:32:05,487
What d'you think I gave you
the piece for

1571
01:32:05,554 --> 01:32:07,790
I ain't about
to shoot nobody.

1572
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:16,599
So what you gonna do?
Dance em' outta here?

1573
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:18,667
Give me that back.

1574
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:21,570
If you're gonna punk out,
punk out now.

1575
01:32:21,637 --> 01:32:22,938
You understand me?

1576
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:28,410
Like your goddamn
brother, dude.

1577
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:30,879
He got hit because
he punked.

1578
01:32:30,946 --> 01:32:33,448
'Now I'm not
sayin' that I did it.'

1579
01:32:33,515 --> 01:32:36,785
So...you're gonna be
like him, huh?

1580
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:39,888
Huh?

1581
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,092
No.

1582
01:32:46,328 --> 01:32:47,329
Good.

1583
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,166
Handle your business, man.

1584
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:00,308
The next category
will be the salsa.

1585
01:33:01,844 --> 01:33:03,712
'Dancer's ready?'

1586
01:34:01,603 --> 01:34:03,338
Whoa, dawg.

1587
01:34:03,405 --> 01:34:04,773
Come on, man.

1588
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,710
What you gonna do with that?

1589
01:34:09,912 --> 01:34:11,379
What did you
do that for?

1590
01:34:11,446 --> 01:34:14,549
Doing what my brother should've
done when he had the chance.

1591
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:16,785
Kick your ass!

1592
01:34:16,852 --> 01:34:18,721
Man, we gotta go.

1593
01:34:21,523 --> 01:34:24,492
You know who you
messin' with, son?

1594
01:34:24,559 --> 01:34:25,961
- Let's go, Easy.

1595
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:29,631
Get off me!

1596
01:34:34,803 --> 01:34:36,471
You messed with
the wrong brother.

1597
01:34:36,538 --> 01:34:39,742
Leave that fool there.
Come on man, let's go.

1598
01:34:43,746 --> 01:34:45,513
Numbers 14

1599
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,482
'212'

1600
01:34:47,549 --> 01:34:50,853
'and 346, remain.'

1601
01:34:50,919 --> 01:34:54,489
'All others, please
clear the floor.'

1602
01:34:54,556 --> 01:34:56,524
'Presenting our next deb..'

1603
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:58,260
Oh my God.
Here she comes.

1604
01:34:58,326 --> 01:35:00,195
'...Caitlin Spencer.'

1605
01:35:01,764 --> 01:35:03,766
Don't freak out.
Please don't freak out.

1606
01:35:03,832 --> 01:35:06,201
Don't screw up.
Please don't screw up.

1607
01:35:06,268 --> 01:35:08,236
Please don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

1608
01:35:08,303 --> 01:35:10,205
'Please don't freak out.
Don't freak out.'

1609
01:35:10,272 --> 01:35:13,641
Just make it to Philip now.
That's all you have to do.

1610
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,210
Where is Philip?

1611
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:17,212
Please don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

1612
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:19,114
- 'Please don't, ah!'
- Oh!

1613
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,222
That's not Philip.

1614
01:35:58,887 --> 01:36:00,755
Now, come on,
we've gotta bounce.

1615
01:36:02,624 --> 01:36:04,592
The next dance is the tango.

1616
01:36:04,659 --> 01:36:06,228
'All competitors, please..'

1617
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:09,297
- I better take this one, son.
- I got this. I got tango.

1618
01:36:09,364 --> 01:36:11,133
Yeah, but you can't
dance it, junior.

1619
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:13,902
Look, Sasha, you decide
who the better man is.

1620
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:15,503
Danjou, come on.

1621
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:17,172
'Remember, ladies and gentlemen'

1622
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,975
'that the $5000 grand prize'

1623
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:22,077
'is awarded to the couple
scoring the highest'

1624
01:36:22,144 --> 01:36:23,879
'in any single round.'

1625
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:25,881
'And I'll announce the winners'

1626
01:36:25,948 --> 01:36:29,017
'at the end of the evening.'

1627
01:36:29,084 --> 01:36:31,920
'And now the tango.'

1628
01:37:20,735 --> 01:37:23,138
'
- I'm fine.

1629
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:28,043
I'm sure he's got
a good reason.

1630
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:30,712
It's not even about him.

1631
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:32,814
It's me.

1632
01:37:32,881 --> 01:37:34,549
I feel so stupid.

1633
01:37:37,552 --> 01:37:40,288
People have been leavin'
me hangin' my whole life.

1634
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:43,158
I don't know why I thought
this will be different.

1635
01:37:47,429 --> 01:37:49,631
You really made me
believe magic could happen

1636
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,599
anywhere, Mr. D.

1637
01:37:53,435 --> 01:37:56,171
I guess you just
didn't mean with me.

1638
01:38:15,857 --> 01:38:17,325
'Very well done.'

1639

'Please show your appreciation,
ladies and gentlemen'

'Morgan Fisher
and Travis Drake.'

1648
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:50,625
Danjou, I don't think
we can beat them.

1649
01:38:50,692 --> 01:38:53,261
I'm sorry, but I don't
know what else to bring.

1650
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:56,098
Stop worrying about what they
got and bring what we got.

Now that's what
I'm talking about.

'Thank you.'

1669

'Thank you,

'Let's see what
the judges have to say.'

1673

The judges have awarded
Miss Fisher and Mr. Drake

1674
01:42:15,763 --> 01:42:19,701
straight 10s
in all categories.

1675
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:27,209
Unfortunately,
as this is a competition

1676
01:42:27,275 --> 01:42:28,876
'for couples and not teams'

1677
01:42:28,943 --> 01:42:32,947
Miss Keane, Mr. Epps
and Mr. Ramos could not score.

'The round, therefore, goes to
Morgan Fisher and Travis Drake.'

1679
01:42:37,252 --> 01:42:38,720

1680
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:41,289
'This perfect score
puts them firmly in the lead'

'Miss Fisher, if you please.'

1685
01:42:56,137 --> 01:42:58,340
Let's call this round a tie.

1686
01:43:00,542 --> 01:43:02,610
- It better be a tie.
- A tie!

1687
01:43:07,415 --> 01:43:09,984
I've never seen anybody move
like that in my life.

1688
01:43:10,051 --> 01:43:11,553
I'm sure.

1689
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:18,059
That was a very
convincing performance.

1690
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:20,595
I'm a pro.

1691
01:43:20,662 --> 01:43:23,631
- 'An unexpected development.'
- Yes!

1692
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,900
'So, ladies
and gentlemen, a tie.'

1693
01:43:25,967 --> 01:43:29,771
'The grand prize
may be shared this evening.'

1694

'Never a dull moment
in ballroom dancing'

1695

'as you can see.'

1696
01:43:38,746 --> 01:43:42,250
Our final competitive dance
is the waltz.

1697
01:44:10,378 --> 01:44:12,113
- 'Excuse me.'
- 'I'm sorry, sir--'

1698
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:15,016
'I've gotta get in there.
I'm in the competition.'

1699
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,384
Excuse me, sir, look, sir.

1700
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:18,453
I
Thank you.

1701
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:23,325
Mr. D., I already know
