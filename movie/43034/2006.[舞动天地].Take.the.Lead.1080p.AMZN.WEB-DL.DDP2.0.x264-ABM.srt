155
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,080
* Call me dirty dirty but I shine so clean *

156
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,949
* Push birdy birdies now I got a new scene *

157
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,383
* Me and Timmy T droppin' out a limousine *

158
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,885
* While the girls fix their lipsticks *

159
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,920
* Zipping their blue jeans *

00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,889
* We sippin' that blue thing and it feels so good *

00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,960
* My location conversation relation help me hood *

163

* The rotation of my records every second made me good *

164
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,180
禁止携带刀械
* I ain't trying to have relations *

165
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,865
* Dirt trying to wood *

166
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,466
* Strong penetration it hurts when it's good *

167
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,135
* Should I choose you or your girl I choose both *

168
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,137
* Call Timmy and enforce my nigga it's time to go *

172
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,740
你来干嘛？参加葬礼？
What you here for? A funeral or somethin'?

173
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,494
我不要改装，修好就行了啦
I don't want it pimped, I want it fixed.

174
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:22,623
好了，回去教室，别站在走廊上
Alright, you've got somewhere to be and it is not in my hallway.

175
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,625
快去啊，动作快！
Get there and get there fast.

176
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,668
保罗洛培兹
Paul Lopez, put a belt in those pants.

177
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,462
要M皮带，我不想看你的内裤

178
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,547
早安
I do not wanna have to see your drawers. Good morning.

179
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,423
小秦
Chin, if I see you on that cell phone one more time, it's mine.

180
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,592
再让我看到你打手机，我就没收

181
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,468
艾迪弗兰
Eddie French, in my office, you know why.

182
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,220
去我办公室，原因你心e有数

183
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,223
我的微积分研究室你决定了吗？
Augustine, have you made a decision yet on my calculus lab?

184
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,475
你以为我会不管别人
Joe, do you think I get special funding for your six kids

185
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,811
替你争取６个学生的资金？
when I have the rest of them to worry about?

186
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,731
他们是资优生，比别的...
My six have a chance. They're smarter than--

187
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,733
你很清楚我对资优生的看法
You know how I feel about "smarter than".

188
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:51,652
有学生在贩毒，算盘打得更精
There's kids selling drugs, doing calculus in their heads.

189
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,572
只要你开放给别的学生参加
If you wanna open up that lab to the rest of them

190
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,574
说不定就准了
maybe we could swing a grant.

191
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,075
你是认真的？
- Yes, I'm serious.

192
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,618
我很认真

193
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:02,496
我们要奖励资优生，不能忽略
We have to honor the kids that are excelling, not neglect them.

194
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,540
本校的资源有限
Joe, we operate on limited resources. Morning, Gretchen.

195
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,083
早安，桂珍

196
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,070
Look, I need these, like..

197
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,305
At a couple of different places

198
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,843
"少年家"，谁死了？
is that gonna be..

199
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,909
Yo, son, who died?

200
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,597
看得出来很有礼貌
Apparently, good manners.

201
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,602
请问那位女士是校长吗？
Excuse me, sir. Was that lady the principal?

202
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,145
对
- Yeah. - Thank you.

203
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,938
谢谢

204
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,735
你是说不客气吧？
Uh-huh.

205
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,993
You mean, "You're welcome," right?

206
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,095
Uh-huh.

207
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,248
今天留校察看你怎麽跑了？
What's this I hear about you bailing out on detention today?

208
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,042
我不想牺牲数学社
I'm not giving up my math club time to babysit delinquents.

209
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,377
去照顾不良少年

210
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,712
那些小孩也需要你指导
Excuse me, those kids need your attention as well.

211
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,423
但资优生更值得指导
But the ones who try actually deserve it.

212
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,611
"少年家"，你干嘛那样？
Yo, son, what the hell you do that for?

213
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,407
她又没拿东西，可以自己开门
She wasn't carrying nothin'.

214
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,240
She coulda opened the door her damn self.

215
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,575
这叫礼貌
It's called courtesy.

216
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,828
你这样很驴耶
Yeah, well, it makes you look like a punk-ass.

217
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,162
是吗？
- Damn straight.

218
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,747
没错

219
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,750
你那样耍白痴就把不到妹啦
Punk-ass moves like that won't get you no play around here.

220
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,377
相信我，我试过了
- Trust me, I've tried it. - Oh, I got plenty of play.

221
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,462
我很吃得开的

222
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,758
别开玩笑了
You kiddin', right?

223
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,149
看见没？
Did you see that?

224
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,318
她们每个人都对我笑
Every single one of them smiled at me.

225
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,863
对，但你没要到电话
Yeah, but you didn't get no numbers.

226
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,449
我又没要电话
I didn't ask for no numbers.

227
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,828
随便啦
Whatever.

228
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:09,498
克莱好几个月没去留校察看
'What about Kline? He hasn't taken detention in months.'

229
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:10,332
他请病假
- I wonder what the--

230
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,459
怪胎罗伊斯？

231
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,460
去当陪审团员
- Jury duty. '

232
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:13,711
又去？

233
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,880
你在看什麽？
What are you looking at?

234
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,007
杜兰先生
Mr. Dulaine.

235
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,342
是敌是友？
- Too early to say.

236
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,344
还看不出来

237
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,346
你来看
'But check this out.'

238
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,307
他替每个人开门
He's been doing that for everyone.

239
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:30,144
每次有女人要过他就站起来
And he stands every time a woman walks past.

240
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,980
怪人！我还真衰咧
Freak. It's just my luck.

241
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,107
叫保全来守著
'Have security standing by.'

242
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,902
杜兰先生！
Mr. Dulaine.

243
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,653
进来吧
Come on in.

244
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,456
艾迪，给我坐好
Eddie, sit your ass down.

245
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,585
请吧
Please.

246
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,337
有何贵干？
What can I do for you?

247
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,881
你不是家长，也不是代课老师
You're not a parent, you're not a sub

248
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,800
更不是警察
you're certainly not a cop.

249
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,551
你怎麽知道？
How can you tell all this?

250
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,179
要等学生来告诉我出什麽事
If I depended on the students to tell me what was going on

251
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,264
麻烦就大了
we'd all be in trouble. I got five minutes, Mr. Dulaine.

252
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,350
给你五分钟

253
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,685
好
Yeah, um..

254
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,230
我礼拜六晚上遇到你们的学生
I ran into one of your students on, uh, Saturday night.

255
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:15,398
很好啊
- How nice for you. - Yeah.

256
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,399
是啊

257
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,359
他在破坏私人物品
He was vandalizing private property.

258
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:20,361
你有报警吗？
Did you file a police report?

259
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,530
没有
No.

260
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,323
我想应该先来找你
I though I should come to you.

261
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,533
错啦
It's the wrong move. I try to prevent crime from happening.

262
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:28,077
我要避免刑案发生，但一旦发生

263
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:30,538
还是报警处理吧
But once it does, the police are who you wanna talk to.

264
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,874
恕我不接待了
So...good day.

265
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,585
就这样？
That's it?

266
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:39,630
我这边就这样，桂珍会送你出去
That's it for me. Gretchen will show you out.

267
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,174
等一下
Oh, oh, oh, hold on, uh..

268
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,886
我应该找谁谈？
Who should I talk to about this?

269
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,558
可能是你的学生
Probably one of your students, right?

270
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:53,269
想必你有很多愤怒的学生
You must have a lot of angry kids at this school.

271
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,896
若学生和你的车子一样重要...
If your kids were as important as your car--

272
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,566
我关心我的车子有错吗？
Excuse me for caring about my car, Mr. Dulaine.

273
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,693
什麽愤怒的学生？
And do not talk to me about angry kids

274
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,069
你又不是什麽专家
like you are some kind of expert.

275
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,320
这是我的学校
This is my school. I decide what is or is not a priority.

276
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:06,198
什麽事先处理由我决定

277
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:10,161
这些学生呢？你优先处理吗？
And these kids? Are they your priorities?

278
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,246
荣誉榜？
Honor roll?

279
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,540
那些学生都死了
Those kids are dead, Mr. Dulaine.

280
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,043
全都是我上任以后死的
'Each and every one of them killed since I have been here.'

281
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:20,129
挂他们的照片是提醒我为什麽累
I keep them right there to remind me of why I'm tired

282
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:22,798
为什麽要每天来上班
and why I keep coming to work

283
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,343
为什麽没时间可以浪费了
and why I have no time to waste.

284
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,595
对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

285
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,722
请恕我失陪
Please excuse me.

286
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:33,309
杜兰先生
- I would like to help.

287
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,728
我想帮忙

288
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,106
有很多社区机构
There are numerous ways community members

289
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,067
可以协助本校学生
can help the students of John Drake High School.

290
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:42,443
有家教机构
There's a Tutoring Program. There's Big Brothers.

291
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,612
照护连线组织、数学中心

292
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,155
语言技能中心
There's the Math Center, the Language Skills Lab

293
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,074
读书会、烟毒防治教育
Book Club, DARE outreach.

294
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,951
我相信这些机构都很好
Y-yeah, I-I'm sure these are fine programs.

295
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,329
但我有自己的方法
Uh...but I have my own methods.

296
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,664
好吧
Alright, um..

297
00:15:56,123 --> 00:16:00,378
我想教你的学生跳舞
I want to teach your kids to dance.

298
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:04,173
相信我，他们最会的就是跳舞了
Believe me, the one thing they do know is how to dance.

299
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,466
国标舞？

300
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,759
你说什麽？

301
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,844
他说国标舞
He said, "ballroom."

302
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,014
对，华尔滋、狐步舞
Uh, yeah. Waltz, fox-trot.

303
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,016
各种国际标准舞
'All the classics.'

304
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,394
对他们有好处
It would be great for them.

305
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,814
好吧，摄影机在哪儿？
Okay, where is the camera?

306
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,858
你说想教我的学生狐步舞
If you are talking about teaching my kids the fox-trot

307
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,819
我一定是上电视了
I must be on television.

308
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,237
好吧
Alright, um..

309
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,323
你学生的事...
Your kids, your call.

310
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,242
...由你决定

311
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,660
谢谢你
Thank you.

312
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,995
告辞
Good morning.

313
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,877
杜兰先生！等一下
Mr. Dulaine! Wait.

314
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:47,508
若你是认真的，或许可以聘任你
If you are serious..

315
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,774
...I just might have an opening for you.

316
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:49,552
３点整来这e找我
You meet me back here at three o'clock sharp.

317
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,303
３点？
Three?

318
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,472
我没什麽耐心
I'm not a particularly patient woman, Mr. Dulaine.

319
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,641
你不想帮忙就算了
Either you wanna help out or you don't.

320
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,144
我会挪出时间
I'll rearrange my schedule.

321
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,153
你好像在躲著我，裘埃
I see you sneaking out on me, Joe L.

322
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,363
e面什麽学生都有
We have kids in there for everything

323
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,199
偷东西、考试作弊
from stealing someone's bag, to cheating on exams..

324
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,367
海特，要平安回家
Hector, home safe.

325
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,245
还有藏毒、破坏公物
...to possession, vandalism

326
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:17,997
打烂别人的脸
to rearranging somebody's face. Basically, if you..

327
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:18,831
基本上...
Hat! Hat!

328
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:19,832
帽子！
If you think of ways to cut corners and collect dimes

329
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,834
只要能捡便宜赚到钱的事

330
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,461
留校察看的学生
these kids in detention are all over it

331
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:25,421
就会趁我们不注意去做

332
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,048
留校察看？
before we've had our morning coffee.

333
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,507
你说你想帮忙
- You said you wanted to help.

334
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,052
相信我，这些学生需要帮忙
Believe me, these kids could use some.

335
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:33,387
大家都说他们是问题学生
'Everyone else calls them the school rejects.'

336
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,264
要留到学期结束
'They're in here for the rest of the term.'

337
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,808
你可能不知道我干嘛带你参观
'In case you were wondering why the scenic tour?'

338
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,227
留校察看不是什麽好事
Detention's far from a beauty spot

339
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,605
但学生自修室被人烧掉以后
but it's the only space we have available

340
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:45,066
就只能选在这e了
after some knucklehead burned up the Study Hall.

341
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,401
故意的？
On purpose?

342
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,237
我赌５美元你明天不会再来
I have five bucks say you won't be back tomorrow.

343
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,990
把球丢过来

344
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,420
詹姆斯校长
'Miss James.'

345
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,297
我们表现良好要提前放人？
What, you springing us for good behavior or something?

346
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:10,049
才怪咧，艾斯先生
No, I'm not, Mr. Epps.

347
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,635
大家听好，这位是杜兰先生
Listen up, everybody, this is Mr. Dulaine.

348
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,179
杜兰先生要监督你们留校察看
Mr. Dulaine here is running your detention

349
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,182
你们要听他的话
and you will do whatever Mr. Dulaine says.

350
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,433
少作梦了
That's what you think.

351
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,685
对啊
- 'Yeah, right.' - They're all yours.

352
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,311
交给你了

353
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,357
球给我
'Hey, give me, give me the ball.'

354
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,025
去打球啦，妈的

355
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:30,611
我再多一点
- 'Let's go, man.' - Pow! Right there.

356
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,780
Yo, follow that queen. Let's go.

357
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,617
大家注意
Pay attention, pay attention.

358
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:41,789
我是皮耶杜兰
- Okay. - Like this..

359
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:42,021
My name is, uh, Pierre Dulaine.

360
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,250
你们可以叫我皮耶
But, uh, you can call me, Pierre.

361
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,292
皮耶？
- You don't sound French.

362
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:46,919
你的口音不像法国人

363
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,295
对
Yeah, uh, my mother was Spanish

364
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,966
家母是西班牙人，家父是法国人

365
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:53,926
我懂６种语言
'my father was French.'

366
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,594
会讲５种
I understand six languages.

367
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,806
每种都有西班牙口音
- 'I speak five.' - Give me that.

368
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,805
All of them with a Spanish accent.

369
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,477
你...
Um, so...you are?

370
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:04,979
叫什麽名字？

371
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,281
同学？
Sir.

372
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,536
他是杰森洛克威尔
It's Jason Rockwell.

373
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,331
对，你可以叫他洛克，皮耶
'Yeah, but you can call him Rock, Pierre.'

374
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:27,043
这位小姐，你呢？
What about you, mademoiselle?

375
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:28,961
乐芮
LaRhette. LaRhette Dudley.

376
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,921
乐芮达德利

377
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,548
幸会，乐芮
Very nice to meet you, LaRhette.

378
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:33,966
你是什麽老师？
So, what kinda teacher are you?

379
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,135
干嘛叫你监督留校察看？
What'd you do they made you run detention?

380
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,428
是我自愿来的
- I asked to be here. - Punk-ass move number two.

381
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,722
猪头二号

382
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:43,267
我教的是国标舞
I teach, uh, ballroom dancing.

383
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,019
国标舞
- Ballroom dancing.

384
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:50,524
你们留校察看期间要学国标舞
And you...are going to learn ballroom dancing

385
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,890
here in your detention.

386
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,530
你说什麽？

387
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,825
英文课没发生过这麽荒唐的事
Nothing this wild ever happens in English.

388
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,035
生物课也没有
Or biology.

389
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,996
打娘胎没见过这麽荒唐的事
The wildest thing yet is that I said yes.

390
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,831
你做了什麽？
You did what?

391
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,376
我要按照身高来分配
I am gonna arrange you by height.

392
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:09,502
你
You...and you. Yeah. Together.

393
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,462
还有你

394
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,922
对，两个一组

395
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,965
才不要咧
- No freakin' way. - 'Ooh!'

396
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:18,803
艾斯先生吗？你和右边那位小姐
'Mr. Epps, was it? And the lady to your right.'

397
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:21,514
你和你一组
Let's have you and you together. You two together.

398
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:22,682
你们两个一组

399
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,226
等一下，为什麽不能跟她？
Hol-hold on a sec. Why can't I be with her?

400
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:26,394
这次不行
Not at this time, sir.

401
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,313
但大家都说丹朱不会跳舞
Yeah, bu-but everybody know Danjou can't dance.

402
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,648
你会跳舞吗？
Are you a dancer, sir?

403
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,484
你不知道？我很会扭耶
What, tu nosabes? I can shake it.

404
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,112
那就和我安排的舞伴一起扭吧
Then I suggest you shake it with the partner I assigned.

405
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,533
没人想监督留校察看
Look, nobody wanted to host the detention hall.

406
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,576
只要交给杜兰先生
'This is a joke.'

407
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:44,036
就有人免费监督了
If I turn it over to him, we get our detention halls for free.

408
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,288
留校察看是处罚犯错的学生
Detention is a place where the kids

409
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,208
留在学校接受监督
who need to spend extra time in school do just that.

410
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,753
留在学校不是让他们跳舞的
Spend extra time in school. Not dancing around.

411
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,797
乔，你知道哪个学生
Joe, do you know any of our students

412
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,882
会想跳国标舞吗？
that are gonna want to do ballroom dancing?

413
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,467
不可能啦
- Absolutely not. - Exactly.

414
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,760
那就对了

415
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,304
我刚发现解决跷课问题的好方法
I think I just discovered the cure for cutting class

416
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,514
还有考试作弊
and for cheating and for any number of miscreant behaviors.

417
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,308
还有各种不良行径

418
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,811
敬狐步舞！
To the fox-trot!

419
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,646
你
To the fox-trot!

420
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:11,814
跟你一组
You and, uh, yes, you, together.

421
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:12,982
等一下
Hold up, that's my cousin. I can't dance with my cousin.

422
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:14,984
他是我表哥，我不能跟表哥跳舞

423
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:15,776
对啊
- Yeah, man.

424
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,321
我和胖妞交换，我跟怪兽跳舞
Me and Big Girl can switch. I'll dance with Monster.

425
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,948
不会吧
Oh, no, man!

426
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,617
你和这位美女一组
You, sir, will be with this lovely lady over here.

427
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:25,494
不行啦
- No, he won't. - 'Oo-oh.'

428
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:26,370
又是表兄妹？
- Hell no!

429
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,414
才不是！

430
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:30,666
我不能跟他跳舞啦
- 'Uh-oh.' - Yo, I can't dance with him.

431
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,126
我要跟别人一组
- Put me with anybody else-- - Alright.

432
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,002
她很烂
- She's trash, that's why. - Don't call her trash.

433
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:33,878
不准骂她烂
You shut the hell up.

434
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:35,296
你闭嘴！

435
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,800
Hey, hey, hey.

436
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:41,469
回去啦

437
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:42,636
我们走吧
- 'Yo, roll up!' - 'I don't wanna be here.'

438
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:44,221
闪人！

439
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:47,641
反正我也不想来，闪人了
- Hey, hold.. - Bye.

440
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,518
我们走吧
I'm outta here, son.

441
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:58,235
好，今天到此为止
Alright, we are finished for today.

442
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,574
Ah!

443
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:25,846
有没有看到我的脚踏车怎麽了？
Did you see what happened to my bike?

444
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:27,765
没呀
- Nope. - "Nope. Nope."

445
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:29,558
没呀

446
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,309
没呀
'How does this work in with the lesson schedule?'

447
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,395
这对课程有什麽影响？

448
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,022
还有新学生和凯琳的社交舞？
'And the new students and Caitlin's cotillion?'

449
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,108
摩根要在比赛前多上点课
Morgan always wants more time before a competition.

450
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,735
可以安排，没问题
You can rearrange. It'll be fine.

451
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,737
那是你的计画？
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:43,239
没问题？
"It'll be fine?"

453
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:46,450
这e何时开始赚钱了？
Just when this place was starting to do well, Pierre.

454
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,869
这些学生可能根本不要你指导
These kids probably don't even want what you're offering.

455
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,413
你问过他们？
Did you ask them?

456
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,998
你有吗？
- Mm-mm.

457
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:54,083
待会儿再谈
- Pierre, we have an emergency. - We'll talk about this later.

458
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,085
皮耶，有急事
Ahem, ladies, what a pleasure.

459
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,921
两位女士，幸会

460
00:22:59,088 --> 00:22:59,797
嗨
Hey.

461
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,674
一定要想办法
- We've got to do something. - Mother.

462
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,635
她没进步，可能还退步了
She's not getting any better, she may be getting worse.

463
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,345
没事的，史宾瑟太太
Oh, she'll be fine, Mrs. Spencer.

464
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,222
她只是要多花点时间
She just needs a little time, that's all.

465
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:11,392
没时间了，社交舞比赛是大事
Time's running out. This cotillion is a huge event.

466
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,936
我和凯琳的爸爸花大钱在宴会上
Caitlin's father and I have spent a fortune on the party.

467
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:17,481
朋友都会来，不能让她像个...
All our friends are coming, I'll not have her looking like a..

468
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,276
我只是想给凯琳安全感
I just, I just want Caitlin to feel secure, alright?

469
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:22,737
我t解，请吧
I understand. Please.

470
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,284
或许我没跳舞的天分
Maybe I'm not made to dance.

471
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:32,038
凯琳，你喜欢跳舞吗？
Caitlin...do you like dancing?

472
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,208
那你就有跳舞的天分
Then you were made to dance.

473
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,918
杜兰先生...
Mr. Dulaine, I want to dance more than anything.

474
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,755
跳舞是我最爱做的事

475
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:41,839
只是...
- It's just...I know I suck. - No, no.

476
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,466
我知道我跳得很烂

477
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:44,300
别胡说
My mom and dad paid so much for my lessons.

478
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,469
我爸妈花了很多钱让我学舞

479
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,846
问题就在这儿
Right there is the problem.

480
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:51,682
你要为自己跳舞
You need to dance for yourself, not for anybody else.

481
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:54,727
不是为别人

482
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,439
好吧
Alright.

483
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:03,110
慢慢来
Very slow, alright?

484
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,650
* Are you ready? *

485
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:14,120
* I need everybody to report to the dance floor right now *

486
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,590
* All my ladies say one two hands in the air *

487
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,792
* Put your right hand up put your left hand up *

488
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,094
* Put your right hand up put your left hand up *

489
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,531
* Put your right hand up put your left hand up *

490
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,766
* Put your right hand up man man *

491
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,301

493
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:34,006
* It's whuteva like the four alarm blaze *

494
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,809
* And I'm hotter than hoes that work at the Days Inn *

495
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,878
* People tryin' to make shit to make people bop *

496
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,681
* I make hits they play then people get shot *

497
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:45,417
* Whuteva whuteva It's whuteva it's whuteva *

498
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,987
* It's whuteva **

499
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,122
我知道
- 'I know.' - 'Good morning.'

500
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:57,248
早安
Let me call you back.

501
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:58,749
我再回你电话

502
00:24:58,874 --> 00:24:59,959
早安
- Good morning. - Good morning.

503
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:00,960
早安

504
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:03,587
你欠我５美元
I believe you owe me five bucks.

505
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:06,507
这大概是我的幻觉吧
And I believe I am seeing things.

506
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,718
留校察看时间还没到
A little early for detention?

507
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,011
谢谢
Thank you. Yeah, uh, we need to talk.

508
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,596
我们有必要谈谈

509
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:14,849
他是乐芮的双胞胎哥哥
'This is LaRhette's twin brother.'

510
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:16,350
他是资优生
He was an honor student, but we lost him to drugs.

511
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,436
结果因毒品而死

512
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,646
他是个好孩子，只是家徒四壁
He was a good kid, just poor as hell.

513
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,858
被越这个笨蛋率领的帮派斗殴
He got in the way of a crew led by this fool, Rock's brother.

514
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:25,067
他是洛克的哥哥

515
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,319
雷蒙洛克威尔是我见过
Raymond Rockwell was the most screwed up evil kid I ever knew.

516
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:29,488
最糟糕、最坏的学生

517
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,700
本来是斗殴，却演变成帮派械斗
What started out as a fistfight turned into a little gang war

518
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:33,951
到最后...
and when it was over, some kids were hurt, some were dead.

519
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,871
有几个学生受伤，有几个死了

520
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:39,081
泰伯杀了莫邱修
Tybalt slays Mercutio.

521
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,334
这不是莎士比亚的戏剧
This isn't Shakespeare, Mr. Dulaine

522
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:42,918
这是公立学校
it's public education.

523
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:43,961
谢谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

524
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,629
多谢你了

525
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:48,591
你知道谁砸了我的车吧？
You know who wrecked my car, don't you?

526
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:53,471
不是黑人，就是拉丁美洲人
Might have been either black or Hispanic.

527
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:55,806
想起来再告诉我
Let me know if you remember.

528
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:01,312
女士们，要换新耳环，我也有

529
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:03,647
你的耳垂太单调了，乐芮

530
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,443
很诡异耶
[June Christy singing "They Can't Take That Away from Me"]

531
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:11,103
* The way you sip your tea.. *

532
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,324
这是什麽？
- Ah! - Ow!

533
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:14,575
拜
- 'Shoot me.' '

534
00:26:14,742 --> 00:26:15,993
什麽噪音？
Man, what's that noise?

535
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:17,536
那个噪音...
That noise is the work of the great American songwriters

536
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,830
是伟大的美国作曲家

537
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,083
伊拉和乔治葛许温的作品
Ira and George Gershwin.

538
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,418
你们要用他们的舞曲来跳舞
Who?

539
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,462
我要混音版的啦
'Some of the amazing artists you'll be dancing to.'

540
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:30,174
大家站起来，向前走一步
Man, I need the remix.

541
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:30,056
Alright, everyone, stand up. Step forward.

542
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,967
我才不要
* The way you haunt my dreams.. *

543
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,095
今天不要
Not today.

544
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,389
好吧
Alright.

545
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:39,266
给你们吸收葛许温乐曲的机会
Maybe I'll just give you a chance to absorb Gershwin.

546
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,727
别闹了！
Ow!

547
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,069

* The way you hold your knife.. *

553
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,743
现在可以关掉了吗？
Okay, can you turn it off now?

554
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:00,788
你说什麽？我听不见
Excuse me? I am afraid I can't hear you.

555
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,925
* The way you've changed my life *

556
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,961
只是想叫他关掉啦
* No no they can't take that away from me *

557
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,422
能不能小声一点？

558
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:14,867
* No they can't take that away *

559
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,869
* From me **

560

乐芮小姐
Miss LaRhette...would you do me the honor?

577
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:54,342
我有这个荣幸吗？

578

这是代表力、浪漫和爱的舞蹈
It is the dance of strength

589
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,308
of romance and love.

590
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,549
谢谢你，达德利小姐
- Thank you, it was lovely. - Uh-huh.

591
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:39,804
你应该回答不客气才对
I believe the appropriate answer to that is, "You're welcome."

592
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,223
"少年家"...
- Uh-huh. - Alright.

593
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:45,017
你讲的是有钱的白人，蓄奴的
Look, son, you're talking about a bunch of rich white folks

594
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,894
没看过马汀路德金恩跳华尔滋
slaveholders. I mean, I've never seen Martin Luther King--

595
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,063
你说对了...
You're right, you're right, you're right. Correct.

596
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:51,107
有些是这种人
- Some were.

597
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,109
但探戈、米兰加
But the tango, the milonga, and even the rumba

598
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:54,402
甚至是伦巴

599
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:57,363
最初都是非洲黑人在跳的
were first danced in some form by Africans.

600
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:58,114
又来了
Why is it that every time you wanna fly something by us

601
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,032
干嘛每次想说服我们

602
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:02,118
就要说跟非洲有关？
'you claim it's got ties to Africans?'

603
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,036
但每次害怕或生气
But every time you get scared or mad, you blame it

604
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,372
又要怪给非洲杀人蜂？
on African killer bees. African Ebola virus.

605
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:07,915
非洲伊波拉病毒？
Right.

606
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,834
什麽西尼罗热？
- Freakin' West Nile fever. - Alright, alright.

607
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,252
好啦...

608
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:14,880
要是我说这些舞跳起来很酷呢？
What if I told you these dances will make you look very cool?

609
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,757
鬼扯淡
I'd say you're full of shit.

610
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,509
洛克威尔先生，这是什麽？
- Doctor's note.

611
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,386
医生写的

612
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,221
我不能跳舞，心脏有毛病
I can't dance, I got a heart condition.

613
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,433
这样啊，你的医生很有意思
I see. Interesting man, your doctor.

614
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,936
很少医生用三孔活页纸写东西
Not many physicians write notes on three-hole paper.

615
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,146
被抓包了
- Busted. - Partners, please.

616
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,106
请分组

617
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:35,317
不要？好吧
No? Alright.

618
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:38,044
- Whoa! - Hey, hey, hey!

619
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:40,197
现在...
Now, ballroom dancing is about two bodies

620
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:41,657
国标舞...

621
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:43,743
是两个人的身体

622
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:45,411
合而为一舞动
moving as one.

623
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,121
我乐意配合啦
I'm down with that. Mm-mm.

624
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:51,083
男士们，牵起舞伴的手
Gentlemen, please, take your partner's hand.

625
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,168
等一下
Hold up. How the hell do I know where his hands have been?

626
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,503
我怎麽知道他手不会乱摸？

627
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,796
来吧，我示范给你看
- Oh, no, no, no!

628
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:56,672
看见没？

629
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,299
不对...
- Now you know. - No, he didn't!

630
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,845
你弄错了啦...
That is not right. That is not right.

631
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:04,263
这样不对...
That is not right.

632
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:06,307
这才是国标舞
- Now, that's ballroom. - You are nasty.

633
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:07,683
你好邪恶

634
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:20,404
欢迎入门狐步舞
'Welcome to the fox-trot, people.'

635
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,531
靠过来一点
Step a little closer. Alright.

636
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,326
好了
* I got music.. *

637
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:26,452
干嘛用这种音乐？
Yo, why we got to use that?

638
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:28,704
连我阿公阿嬷都不听
My grandparents don't even listen to that stuff.

639
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:32,208
这种音乐最适合狐步舞了
That stuff give us the perfect fox-trot rhythm.

640
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,793
很好
Good, good.

641
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,544
女士们...
Now, ladies, start on the right foot

642
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:38,881
从右脚开始，往后退

643
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,973
going backward.

644
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,343
男生从左脚开始
Men on the left, stepping forward.

645
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,719
往前踏

646
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,014
慢慢往后踏两步
Two slow steps back.

647
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,267
往旁边快步踏两次
Two quick ones to the side.

648
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:51,769
像这样
It goes like this, slow, slow.

649
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,604
慢、慢

650
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,730
快、快
'Quick, quick. Slow, slow.'

651
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:56,732
慢、慢

652
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:57,775
快、快
Quick, quick. Slow, slow.

00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,610

00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,655
慢、慢

656
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,698
快、快
'Quick, quick, good.'

657
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:05,241
很好

658
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,952
再跳啊，快、快
Come on, nice. Quick, quick.

659
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:12,790
这位先生...
Ow!

660
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:14,606
Sir, sir, just, let me just show you, eh?

661
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:13,833
我来示范吧

662
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:15,793
仔细看
Everybody. Please.

663
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,336
干嘛每次都找我示范？
Why I always got to demonstrate it?

664
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:18,921
因为你会跳
- Because you can do it. - 'Alright. Hold on.'

665
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,381
好吧，等一下，是...

666
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,966
慢、慢
Slow, slow.

Hi, mommy.

00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,027
先去我房间，我马上过去
'Go on back. I'll be there in a minute.'

677
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:48,034
弟弟妹妹都吃了吗？
- Baby had a second bottle.

678
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,952
宝宝喝了第二瓶

679
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,079
６点左右喂他们的
I fed them at like six.

680
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:55,416
等我办完事再说
We'll talk when I'm through.

681
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,469
慢、慢
Slow, slow. Quick, quick. Slow..

682

干嘛啦？
What you doin'?

707
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,894
你在干嘛？
What the hell you turn the music off for?

708
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,646
把音乐关掉

709
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:00,981
他来了
'Here he is...life of the party.'

开始吧
Here we go.

杜兰
Du-lame.

713
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,367
不必停下来
You don't have to stop. That was amazing.

714
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:12,410
跳得很好
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

715

谢谢

716

不客气

717
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,123
各位...
Now, guys, why can't you put that emotion and energy

718
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:18,916
何不把那种情绪和活力

719
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,543
融入我的国标舞？
into my style of dance?

720
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,169
门儿都没有
That's impossible, man.

721
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,672
是吗？为什麽？
Really

722
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,632
因为你的音乐太烂
'Cause your music sucks.

723
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,218
太老土了，根本没感情
It's corny. There ain't no feelin' in it.

724
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:31,012
没感情？
- Mm-mm.

725
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:32,555
你怎麽能这样讲？
How can you say that?

730
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,396
你的爱情可能跟我们不一样
Well, maybe you love different than we do.

731
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:43,190
看看你讲什麽罗曼蒂克
Look at you, you're all flowers and things.

讲些废话想逗她高兴
Sayin' shit tryin' to make her feel nice.

我们没空玩这些
We ain't got no time for that.

735
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,448
要直捣黄龙啊
We want to get right down to the ill na-na.

Love is universal, my friend.

她是凯琳史宾瑟

883
00:42:10,797 --> 00:42:12,132
今天要和我们一起上课
She's joining us for the day.

884
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:13,967
你不是没访客了？
Thought we saw the last of your visitors.

885
00:42:14,134 --> 00:42:15,927
凯琳和别人...
Well, Caitlin is, uh...different.

886
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:16,928
...不一样
Think of her as a foreign exchange student.

887
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:19,556
就当她是外籍交换学生吧

888

Hold on, where did the equipment come from?

我跟朋友买的
- Yeah, bought it from a friend. - Yeah.

891
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:29,774
你是说你为了留校察看去买？
You're telling me, you actually bought all this for detention?

892
00:42:29,899 --> 00:42:33,069
这是合法的

893
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,408
这是圣诞礼物
- 'Yeah, it's all good.' - 'I got it for Christmas.'

894
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:40,785
假装我相信你吧
We'll pretend I believe you.

895
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:43,121
请你放点我可以跳舞的音乐
Now, put on something I can work with, please.

And guess what? Positions, please.

Eyes over here. Eyes over here.

今天要跳伦巴
Today, we rumba.

904
00:42:57,677 --> 00:42:58,428
再来...
And...quick, quick, slow.

905
00:42:58,553 --> 00:43:00,305
快、快、慢

906
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,100
快、快、慢，这是伦巴基本舞步
Quick, quick, slow. That's the basic rumba.

907
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:06,311
艾迪？
'Eddie. Eddie!'

908
00:43:06,436 --> 00:43:07,395
艾迪！
Dance with Caitlin so I can show you.

909
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,730
跟凯琳跳舞，我示范给你看

910
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:11,941
拜，不要啦，我才不跟她跳舞
Oh, man, no, hell no, I'm not dancing with her.

911
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:14,527
我知道我的舞技不够精湛
I know I'm not the best dancer in the world or anything

912
00:43:14,694 --> 00:43:17,405
但这个女的太逊了啦
but your girl right here is just pitiful.

913
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,157
还有一件事
Yeah, a-a-and another thing

914

不要再有白鬼来观光了啦
we don't need any more white-bread tourists

915
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:25,038

seein' how the other half lives. We don't.

916

白鬼？
White I'm sorry, do you own a mirror?

917

抱歉，你有镜子吗？

918
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,212

好了，拉摩
Alright, Ramos. You dance with Caitlin.

等一下
Just a second.

937
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:40,113
你那天晚上砸了奥格丝婷的车子
The night you destroyed Augustine's car.

938
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:42,574
是为了什麽？
- Because it felt good.

939
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:44,451
因为我爽

940
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:46,035
就这样？
That's all?

941
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:48,163
我的事要你管？
Why you in my business, man?

942
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:50,957
失去亲人是很痛苦的
It's hard to lose someone you love. It hurts.

943
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:52,208
伤痛欲绝
It's easy to think that something on the street can fill

944

00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,023
[Jae Millz singing "I Like That"]

1028
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,958
* Stop mummy work that ass out and get it on the floor.. *

1029
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,194
I spit fire till the day that I die--

1030
00:49:55,595 --> 00:49:57,889
麦克风给我，你干嘛？
Give me that mike, dude. What you doing?

1031
00:49:58,056 --> 00:49:59,432
你又不会唱饶舌
- I'm flowin'. - You can't rap.

1032
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,300
* Hey let me hear you say I like that yeah.. *

1033
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:03,394
乔治和伊拉怎麽了？
What happened to George and Ira?

1034
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,521
他们退休了
- They retired, man. - Demo time!

1035
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:06,064
示范时间！

1036
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:08,673
* Now let me hear you say I like that yeah *

1037
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,708
* What you think about it * * I like that *

1038
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:12,737
你好像有点困惑
* Yeah what you think about it.. *

1039
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:13,905
听著
You're looking a little confused.

1040
00:50:14,072 --> 00:50:16,908
其实很简单，只要混合两种音乐
It's simple really. We scratch two different joints together.

1041
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:19,661
但两种节奏结构是一样的
But the underbelly of the beats are all the same.

1042
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:20,912
看好了
See, watch.

1043
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:23,081
快、快、慢

1044
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:24,707
这是我现在跳的基本节奏
It's the bottom beat that I'm dancing to now.

1045
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:26,084
也可以改掉
But I can change it up though. Yo, E. Flip it.

1046
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:28,211
艾迪，弄给他听

1047
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,430
* No you and your... you better stop *

1048
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:34,165
* I like it when the music come on so we can just *

1049
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,201
* Rock like this yeah I like *

1050
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:39,264
看吧？很简单
* I like it when the beat just pumps so we can just.. **

1051
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:42,392
主节奏消音，这样还是可以跳
You can take out the underbelly

1052
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,707
and dance to the top of the beat.

1053
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,145
其他节奏消音，主节奏可以跳舞
You can take out the top and dance to the underbelly.

1054
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:47,272
疯狂吧？超厉害的
It's crazy, right? It's tight.

1055
00:50:47,439 --> 00:50:49,274
是啊
Yes. Yes.

1056
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:53,945
两首曲子
Two songs.

1057
00:50:54,112 --> 00:50:55,864
混合在一起？
- Yeah.

1058
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:00,034
好主意啊
This is a beautiful idea. Yeah.

1059
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,537
对，我喜欢

1060
00:51:02,662 --> 00:51:04,998
这表示我们可以...
Yeah, it is.

1061
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:05,696
Which means, we could use, let's say

1062
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:07,625
用你的音乐混合我的音乐
your music with my music and then back to your music.

1063
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:09,961
再回到你的音乐

1064
00:51:10,462 --> 00:51:11,421
让我来试试
- Let me try something.

1065
00:51:11,546 --> 00:51:12,714
让我来试试
Uh, this one.

1066
00:51:13,506 --> 00:51:14,841
就这张吧

1067
00:51:15,216 --> 00:51:16,426
看看行不行得通
- Alright, see if this works. - 'Alright.'

1068
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:17,302
第４首
- Number four. - 'It better be something new.'

1069
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:18,845
最好来点新鲜的

1070
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,313
["I Like That You Can't Take That Away from Me"]

1071
00:51:22,098 --> 00:51:23,933
快、快、慢...
* The way you wear your hat.. *

1072
00:51:25,477 --> 00:51:28,521
这是莎莎舞的基本节奏
'Now, these are the basic beats for salsa, right?'

1073
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:30,023
懂吗？

1074
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,441
很好
Good, good. Now, I want you to fall in and count with me.

1075
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:34,319
现在你们一起跳，跟著我打拍子

1076
00:51:35,904 --> 00:51:37,947
只要主节奏
Underbelly rhythm only.

1077
00:51:38,073 --> 00:51:39,699
好了吗？很好
'Alright? Good. Now, partner it up.'

1078
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,326
现在分组吧

1079
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:42,702
好了
Yeah, yeah.

1080
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:43,745
大家来吧...

1081
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,330

* Your boy's crazy man *

1083

别看著地板
Eyes off of the floor.

1084
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,961
你的灵魂不在脚上
Your soul is not in your feet, alright?

1085
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:57,014
* Lemme hear you say it * * The way you wear your hat *

1086
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,284
* Wonder wonder wonder what's the winning *

1087
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,986
* Homie you'll always be a runner-up *

1088
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,014
怪兽，你块头太大了
Monster, you're too big.

1089
00:52:03,139 --> 00:52:05,517
每个动作都像洛矶山
Every move you make, it's like the Rocky Mountains.

1090
00:52:05,683 --> 00:52:06,392
对不起
- I'm sorry. - I need another partner.

1091
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,020
皮耶先生，我要换舞伴

1092
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,895
Alright and..

想不想跟我跳？
- Better not.

1094
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,903
最好不要，刚才你没看到吗？
Didn't you see what just happened?

1095
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,863
他们叫我怪兽是有原因的
They call me Monster for a reason.

1096
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,032
我没跳舞的天分
I'm just not made to dance.

1097
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,326
怪兽，你喜欢跳舞吗？
- Yeah, I guess so.

1098
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:25,120
大概吧

1099
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:27,372
那你就有跳舞的天分
Then you were made to dance.

1100
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,816
* I like that I like it when the music come on *

1103
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,457
* So we could just move like this I like that *

1104
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,429
那是什麽舞步？
Whoa!

1105
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,727
What is the name of that move?

1106
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:45,056
没名字，是我发明的
Got no name. You're looking at history in the making.

1107
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:46,641
很好，管跳吧
Good, just do it.

1108
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:50,801
* Rows go sit on my neck rows go sit on my wrist *

1109
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:54,104

1120
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,700

1121
00:53:24,137 --> 00:53:25,138

你不听我的话了，搞什麽独立嘛
'You never listen to me no more. Is that too much to ask?'

1136
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:10,892

圣诞老人应该要付圣诞树的钱
'Wasn't Santy Claus supposed to foot the bill for the tree?'

'She told me to wait.'

1151

我不想问你钱从哪来的
I ain't gonna ask where this is from.

00:56:10,678 --> 00:56:11,846
我又没要伤害你
- I didn't mean no harm by it. - Yeah, whatever.

1175
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:13,848
随你怎麽说

1176
00:56:16,976 --> 00:56:18,061
色狼
- Nasty-- - Listen, I offered to pay you.

1177
00:56:19,187 --> 00:56:20,146
我是要付你钱耶

1178
00:56:20,313 --> 00:56:20,939
出去！
- Get out! Get out! - I should take it from you.

1179
00:56:21,064 --> 00:56:21,773
我早该硬上了

1180
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,274
走开！

1181
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,442
你想怎样？来嘛
- Get off of me!

1182
00:56:24,609 --> 00:56:26,277
走开！

1183
00:56:26,403 --> 00:56:27,404
妈！
- Hey! - Mommy!

1184
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:29,155
怎麽回事？
What's going on here?

你干嘛来这e？
What the hell are you doing here?

1204
00:58:34,155 --> 00:58:37,200
我也想问你，但我看得出来
I could ask you the same thing, but I could already see.

* When I grew up and fell in love **

1206
00:58:40,328 --> 00:58:41,996
开著吧，我要走了
- Leave it on. I'm gonna go. - You didn't answer my question.

1207
00:58:42,122 --> 00:58:43,748
你还没回答我

1208
00:58:43,915 --> 00:58:45,792
你来这e干嘛？
- Oh.

1209
00:58:47,377 --> 00:58:50,338
我在隔壁练习狐步舞
I was down the hall, you know, practicing my fox-trot

1210
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:51,881
听到你的音乐就...
then I heard your music, so I--

1211
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:53,842
少放屁了
Go to hell.

1212
00:59:00,473 --> 00:59:02,767
你想知道我来干嘛？我回不了家
You wanna know why I'm here? 'Cause I can't go home.

1213
00:59:02,892 --> 00:59:04,853
你哥打死小雷以后我爸就酗酒
My pop's been drunk ever since your brother--

1214
00:59:04,978 --> 00:59:06,146
别提我哥的事
- Don't talk about my brother! - He was sick.

1215
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:08,565
他病了，结果你哥又干鸟事

1216
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,024
别提我哥的事
- Then your brother had to-- - I said don't talk about him!

1217
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,942
他是毒贩
- He was a crack dealer. - He only dealt to bring food.

1218
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:13,445
他贩毒是为了养家活口

1219
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:14,279
自从我爸...
- Ever since my daddy-- "

1220
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:15,447
爸爸？
Do you know who your daddy is? Everybody know your mom's a ho.

1221
00:59:15,613 --> 00:59:16,573
你知道你爸是谁？

1222
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,116
大家都知道你妈是妓女

1223

不要说我妈
- Don't talk about my mama! '

Hello?

1227
00:59:33,423 --> 00:59:34,799
什麽？
What?

1228
00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:37,844
应该早点讲你跟他们说我是你爸
You could've warned me you told them I was your father. I mean..

1229
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:41,431
别激动，没人管你是不是我爸
Relax. Nobody cares who your real pops is around here anyway.

1230
00:59:41,556 --> 00:59:42,974
我想也是
Obviously not.

1231
00:59:43,141 --> 00:59:44,976
我只知道半夜被人吵醒
Where I'm from, when a person gets woken up

1232
00:59:45,143 --> 00:59:46,811
要有好理由
in the middle of the night, they get answers.

1233
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:48,646
你想知道什麽？
What you wanna know?

1234
00:59:48,813 --> 00:59:50,565
第一件事
Let's start with, uh why call me?

1235
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,984
为什麽打电话给我？

1236
00:59:54,277 --> 00:59:57,489
只有你和另一个人会来救我
You're the only one I could think of

1237
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:59,163
who might come down and get me.

1238
00:59:58,656 --> 01:00:01,659
请问你为什麽住锅炉室？
Need I ask you why you were living in the boiler room?

1239
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:07,290
要不是她去闹场就不会被发现了
Man, if she never came there, everything would've been cool.

1240
01:00:07,457 --> 01:00:09,292
不可思议
Unbelievable. You know..

1241
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:12,045
你们的共同点可能比你想像更多
...maybe you two have more things in common than you think.

1242
01:00:12,212 --> 01:00:13,755
孩子，走吧
My son, come on.

1243
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,850
我只是想过一夜
Hey, man, it's just for the night, you know

1244
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:28,478
别以为我会去上你的课
'so don't think I'm coming to class or anything.'

1245
01:00:28,645 --> 01:00:30,271
我们处不来，不算是朋友
We ain't kickin' it. We ain't friends.

1246
01:00:30,396 --> 01:00:32,023
我知道
I got it.

1247
01:00:32,982 --> 01:00:34,859
我可能会打呼哦
And maybe I snore a little, I don't know..

1248
01:00:35,026 --> 01:00:36,236
没关S
Oh, that's okay, 'cause I know I snore.

1249
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:38,238
因为我也会打呼

1250
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:50,083
你家好漂亮
It's a nice place you got here.

1251
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:53,169
我以后也要住这种房子
I'm gonna have me a spot like this someday.

1252
01:00:53,837 --> 01:00:56,005
乾乾QQ的
Someplace clean.

1253
01:00:57,465 --> 01:01:00,009
你想要什麽都可以
You can get whatever you want, Rock.

1254
01:01:01,177 --> 01:01:03,930
只不过有些人要什麽有什麽
No, only some people get the shit they want.

1255
01:01:04,097 --> 01:01:06,558
这倒是
That's true.

1256
01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:09,769
他们是勇于追求才能得到
And those are the people who show up to get it.

1257
01:01:13,773 --> 01:01:16,735
有没有人说你话太多？
Anybody ever tell you you talk too much?

1258
01:01:17,277 --> 01:01:19,154
有啊
Yeah. They did.

1259
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:23,032
晚安
'Goodnight.'

1260
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:38,882
那不是重点
- That's not the point. - The point is they need help.

1261
01:01:39,007 --> 01:01:40,717
重点是他们需要帮忙

1262
01:01:40,842 --> 01:01:41,885
不是留校察看
Not suspension from school.

1263
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:42,635
真的吗？
Oh, really. Please tell me, Professor Dulaine

1264
01:01:42,802 --> 01:01:44,763
请告诉我，杜兰教授

1265
01:01:44,929 --> 01:01:47,348
他们需要什麽帮忙
exactly what kind of help it is they need?

1266
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:51,895
校长要我来监督你们
'So, as your principal has made me your executioner'

1267
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,563
你们每天早上７点半
'you'll report every morning at 7:30 a.m.'

1268
01:01:53,688 --> 01:01:55,607
就来向我报到个别指导
'for a private session.'

1269
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:56,524
什麽？
What?

1270
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,569
彼此看不顺眼就当舞伴来和好吧
Whatever problems you have, you can work out as partners.

1271
01:01:59,569 --> 01:02:03,156
有时候征服敌人最好的方法
Sometimes the best way to conquer an enemy

1272
01:02:03,281 --> 01:02:04,741
就是面对面交手
is to get right up in his face.

1273
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:06,659
我宁死也不跟他面对面
- I'd rather be dead. - I feel the same way.

1274
01:02:06,785 --> 01:02:08,078
我有同感

1275
01:02:08,244 --> 01:02:09,287
两位...
You know, guys, you're lucky.

1276
01:02:09,454 --> 01:02:10,705
你们很幸运

1277
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,916
共通情绪可以很强烈
'Common emotions can be very powerful.'

1278
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:15,001
这是很好的开始
This is an excellent beginning, starting now.

1279
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:16,461
从现在开始

1280
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:18,004
请吧
Please, take the dancing position.

1281
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:19,839
就定跳舞位置

1282
01:02:19,964 --> 01:02:21,257
请吧
Please...come on.

1283
01:02:21,674 --> 01:02:22,967
跳吧

1284
01:02:25,845 --> 01:02:27,388
我来看看
Let's see this.

1285
01:02:27,514 --> 01:02:30,642
只要慢慢跳就好了
We are just going to move, very simply.

1286
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:32,268
像走路一样
Let's just, uh, walk.

1287
01:02:32,435 --> 01:02:35,814
不对，乐芮，由男生带舞
No, no, no. LaRhette, the man leads.

1288
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,273
女生跟上去就够了
It's the woman's job to follow.

1289
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:40,110
让他带舞就表示他才是老大？
So if he gets to lead, then he's gonna think he's boss?

1290
01:02:40,235 --> 01:02:44,447
不对，负责带舞的是男生
No, but he's not. You see..

1291
01:02:44,572 --> 01:02:48,451
女生只能跟上去表示接受邀请
The man proposes the step.

1292
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:49,166
It is the woman's choice to accept...by following.

1293
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:52,914
跟舞和带舞一样自主
Now, to follow takes as much strength as to lead.

1294
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,291
可以吗？好了
Good? Alright.

1295
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:57,710
再来一次，来吧
Let's do it again. Come on, come on!

1296
01:02:57,836 --> 01:02:58,920
来吧

1297
01:03:00,004 --> 01:03:02,090
洛克，走路就好了
Now, Rock, just walk. Just forward, just walking.

1298
01:03:02,215 --> 01:03:03,425
往前进，像走路一样

1299
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,510
前进，像那样走路
'Yeah, forward. Just walking, like that.'

1300
01:03:06,261 --> 01:03:08,179
这就对了
Here you go.

1301
01:03:08,304 --> 01:03:09,764
对，你们都会走路
Yeah, you know how to walk. Now walk back.

1302
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:11,808
再走回来

1303
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:13,226
很好
There you go.

1304
01:03:14,352 --> 01:03:16,521
这就是在跳舞了啊
* You're dancing you're dancing **

1305
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:22,694
探戈的截步姿势
In the corte position of the tango

1306
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:25,655
是要把舞伴拉近一点
you must hold your partner much closer.

1307
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:29,159
男生别太兴奋，女生别太害怕
Boys, don't get too excited. Girls, don't get too scared.

1308
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:31,828
男士们，腿往这边伸
Alright? Now, your leg goes here, gentlemen.

1309
01:03:31,995 --> 01:03:34,873
女士们，右上胸像这样碰他
And, ladies, your upper right chest touches his, like so..

1310
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,000
你离太远了，靠过来
- You're so far back. Move up. - Uh, yeah.

1311
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:37,834
对啦
'The top of your thighs must stay'

1312
01:03:38,001 --> 01:03:39,377
大腿上半部不动

1313
01:03:39,502 --> 01:03:41,629
彼此贴紧以保持平衡
glued to each other for perfect balance.

1314
01:03:41,755 --> 01:03:44,048
接著才能这样做
That way, this is possible.

1315
01:03:46,634 --> 01:03:47,343
干得好
- Good. - Come on, dance together.

1316
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,678
大腿贴紧

1317

探戈还有很多}合姿势
'There are multiple positions for the tango.'

1318
01:03:51,014 --> 01:03:52,265
你要去哪儿？
Where you going?

1319
01:04:08,573 --> 01:04:09,741
怎样？

1320
01:04:09,908 --> 01:04:10,867
你来干嘛？

1321
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:13,203
办公室有个辣妹给我你的地址
Some hottie in the office gave me your 411.

1322
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:15,205
我正在吃...
- I-I was eating...supper.

1323
01:04:15,914 --> 01:04:17,123
...晚饭

1324
01:04:17,248 --> 01:04:18,958
我先请？

1325
01:04:24,339 --> 01:04:25,632
你还好吧？
Are you alright?

1326
01:04:25,757 --> 01:04:28,093
我很好，只是...
I'm a'ight. It's just, uh..

1327
01:04:28,426 --> 01:04:30,720
像我这种人
It's just for a player like me..

1328
01:04:30,845 --> 01:04:33,389
我把妹很有一套
...man, I gotta keep them girls on lock, you know?

1329
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:37,393
柯德，你到底想说什麽？
Uh...what exactly are you saying, Kurd?

1330
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:40,480
我和胖妞
Me and Big Girl, man..

1331
01:04:41,439 --> 01:04:44,567
大腿要贴紧什麽的
...you know, with the thighs touching together and shit?

1332
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:48,988
有问题吗？
Is that a problem?

1333
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:51,533
对，有问题
Hell yeah, it's a problem.

1334
01:04:51,658 --> 01:04:54,411
被人发现我喜欢她，我就完了
I'm done for if the homies find out I like her.

1335
01:04:54,953 --> 01:04:56,204
谢谢
Uh, uh, just, thank you.

1336
01:04:56,788 --> 01:04:59,249
别人都觉得胖妞...
Everybody else thinks Big is, well..

1337
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,626
不算是辣妹啦
...you know, not exactly the hottest female around?

1338
01:05:01,793 --> 01:05:03,420
你怎麽想的最重要
It is only what you think that matters.

1339
01:05:03,586 --> 01:05:06,297
说得倒轻，你本来就是怪胎了
Yeah, easy for you to say, man.

1340
01:05:06,423 --> 01:05:07,298
谢谢
- You already a freak. - Thank you.

1341
01:05:08,049 --> 01:05:09,801
我不知道是怎麽回事
Look, I don't know how it happened.

1342
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:11,428
有一天...
One day, it was just like whoa!

1343
01:05:11,594 --> 01:05:13,555
就突然来电了

1344
01:05:15,098 --> 01:05:17,517
有勇气追求你想要的
Uh, listen, having the courage to follow your heart

1345
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:19,561
这样才是真正的男子汉
is what makes a man a real man.

1346
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:22,355
这个辣妹是谁？
- That's what..

1347
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,731
她是我老婆
Uh, that is my wife. Thank you.

1348
01:05:23,857 --> 01:05:24,524
你老婆？
- Yes.

1349
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:25,233
对

1350
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:27,068
好狗运啊，她人呢？
Lucky man. Where's she at?

1351
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:29,612
她５年前过世了
She died...five years ago.

1352
01:05:31,614 --> 01:05:34,159
那...
Oh. So, uh..

1353
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:37,203
你又把到别人了吗？
So are you like buck wilding anyone else now?

1354
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:39,789
没有
No, I'm not.

华尔滋
The waltz.

1356
01:05:44,753 --> 01:05:47,630
彼此不信任就跳不成了
It cannot be done without trust between partners.

1357
01:05:47,797 --> 01:05:49,966
那就别跳了啊
Well, then it's just not gonna happen.

1358
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:52,719
要搏取信任，乐芮
But trust must be earned, LaRhette.

1359
01:05:53,178 --> 01:05:54,262
祝你好运
- Good luck with that. - Alright.

1360
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:58,224
好吧，我有个办法可以帮上忙

1361
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:59,256
I have something here that is gonna help.

1362
01:05:58,641 --> 01:06:00,393
别拿那个蒙我眼睛啦
Don't put that thing on my eyes.

1363
01:06:00,518 --> 01:06:03,104
我想请你做一件勇敢的事
I'm asking you to do something very courageous.

1364
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:05,231
除了和他跳舞以外？
Besides dance with him?

1365
01:06:05,607 --> 01:06:07,317
好，来吧
There. Come on.

你有机会用尽你的体力和技巧
You have the opportunity to use

1370
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:17,807
every bit of strength and skill you possess

1371
01:06:16,743 --> 01:06:19,412
不是要支配她
not to dominate her

1372
01:06:19,537 --> 01:06:21,790
而是要带她神游
but to take her on a journey.

1373
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:24,959
这个要求很高
It is a lot to ask.

1374
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:29,005
能不能和怎麽神游
If and how you take the journey..

1375
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,132
都由你决定
...that's entirely up to you.

1376
01:06:42,393 --> 01:06:44,354
他走了？
He's gone?

1377
01:06:44,521 --> 01:06:46,272
对
Yeah.

1378
01:06:49,234 --> 01:06:50,693
你要来吗？
- I guess.

1379
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:52,362
好吧

1380
01:06:54,531 --> 01:06:55,990
错边了
Wrong way.

1381
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:58,493
你要先前进，我先后退
You always start forward and I start back.

1382
01:06:58,618 --> 01:06:59,536
我自己会
- Alright. I can figure it out. - I'm just trying to help.

1383
01:06:59,702 --> 01:07:01,371
我只是想帮忙

1384
01:07:01,538 --> 01:07:04,249
拿布条蒙住你的嘴啦
I wish he'd tied that thing around your mouth.

1385
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:06,543
准备好了吗？

我看到了
- I saw that.

1390
01:07:24,978 --> 01:07:26,104
什麽？

1391
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:27,689
你笑什麽？
- Shut up. I'm not.

1392
01:07:27,814 --> 01:07:30,150
闭嘴，我没笑

1393
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:35,155
好吧，你没笑
Alright, you're not.

1394
01:07:52,881 --> 01:07:54,632

对，装在那e
Set it down right there.

有用了

1398
01:08:03,975 --> 01:08:05,602
好了，启动吧，汤米
'Alright, hit it, Tommy!'

1399
01:08:08,605 --> 01:08:12,067
好了，请不要穿布鞋踏进舞池

你在干嘛？
What the hell are you doing?

1442

解释起来有点}杂啦，我...
Well, it's kind of complex to explain what's going on.

You guys are just taking up time and space I paid for.

1464
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:08,243
看见没？
You see that? That's what ballroom dancing looks like.

01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:10,912
那才叫国标舞

1466
01:11:11,037 --> 01:11:13,873
你们跳的根本是半调子
What you're doing doesn't even come close.

1467
01:11:13,998 --> 01:11:16,960
比赛时再看看谁是半调子
Yeah, well, let's see who comes close at the competition.

1468
01:11:17,127 --> 01:11:18,586
比赛？
The competition? You guys are going to compete?

1469
01:11:18,753 --> 01:11:19,754
你们要参加比赛？

1470
01:11:19,879 --> 01:11:23,133
对，惊讶吗？还是担心？
Yeah. What, you surprised?

1471
01:11:23,258 --> 01:11:24,092
怎麽回事？
If you wanna shell out 200 bucks apiece to get slaughtered

1472
01:11:24,217 --> 01:11:26,636
想每个人缴两百美元等著出糗

1473
01:11:26,803 --> 01:11:28,346
随便你们
fine by me.

1474
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:30,056
等一下，两百美元？
Hold on, man, hold on. $200, what is she talking about?

1475
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:31,057
她在胡说什麽？

1476
01:11:31,182 --> 01:11:32,809
各位，回舞池去
Everybody, back on the floor, come on.

1477
01:11:32,976 --> 01:11:33,810
要干嘛？

1478
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:34,602
你说什麽？

1479
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:35,770
最好是听不懂啦
Hell yeah, excuse you. What you teaching us, dude?

1480
01:11:35,895 --> 01:11:36,938
你随便教我们几招

1481
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:39,607
却留高招教这些人？
Some bargain basement two-steps

1482
01:11:39,774 --> 01:11:42,694
不，舞步都一样
while these kids got the real moves?

1483
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:43,733
No, no, Ramos, Ramos, the steps are all the same.

1484
01:11:42,819 --> 01:11:44,738
他们只是学得比较久
They've simply been doing them longer, that's all.

1485
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:47,198
我们拿什麽跟人比？
How are we supposed to compete with something like that?

1486
01:11:47,323 --> 01:11:48,324
游戏结束，闪吧
- Game over, let's roll. - No, wait!

1487
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:49,325
等一下
No, you've been wasting our time, homes.

1488
01:11:49,451 --> 01:11:50,618
你在浪费我们的时间

1489
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:53,496
害我们出洋相
Making goddamn fools out of all of us.

1490
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:55,165
你早就知道我们跳不好
You knew all along we couldn't do this thing.

1491
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:57,834
才不是呢
That is not true!

1492
01:11:58,001 --> 01:12:00,545
我教给你们的很有价值
What I have taught you has value.

1493
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,963
在哪e？
Where? Not where I live.

1494
01:12:02,088 --> 01:12:04,132
不适合我住的环境

1495
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:07,844
我们走吧
Come on.

1496
01:12:32,285 --> 01:12:33,203
我真不敢相信
I can't believe this.

1497
01:12:33,369 --> 01:12:36,664
数学和阅读能力排名倒数

1498
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,687
You've got fourth percentile general math and reading scores

1499
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:39,459
你还有学生在浪费时间跳舞
and you've got kids wasting time dancing around.

1500
01:12:39,584 --> 01:12:41,753
我别无选择，只能举发你
I've got no choice but to report you.

1501
01:12:44,839 --> 01:12:46,341
那份给你
That's yours.

1502
01:12:51,888 --> 01:12:54,557
这是１９２０年代建造的
It was like, uh, constructed in the 1920s.

1503
01:12:54,682 --> 01:12:56,184
我不知道你喜欢建筑
I didn't know you liked architecture.

1504
01:12:56,309 --> 01:12:57,018
我超爱的
- I love it--

1505
01:12:57,143 --> 01:12:59,354
你喜欢建筑？喜欢我房间吗？

1506
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:01,397
闭嘴，你干嘛这麽讨人厌？
- Shut up! You're such an ass.

1507
01:13:01,523 --> 01:13:02,816
不管你们了
Forget both of you. Can't take this anymore.

1508
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:03,900
那是什麽？
- Forget you too.

1509
01:13:04,025 --> 01:13:04,609
也不管你了

1510
01:13:04,734 --> 01:13:07,570
三角问题留给你自己处理
Leave your love triangle problems to yourself.

1511
01:13:07,695 --> 01:13:08,947
逊毙了
- This sucks. - Good afternoon, everyone.

1512
01:13:09,072 --> 01:13:10,698
大家午安

1513
01:13:10,865 --> 01:13:12,158
请就位
- Positions, please. - Yo, dance class is over, man.

1514
01:13:12,283 --> 01:13:14,994
舞蹈课结束了

1515
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,871
还没有
No, it is not.

1516
01:13:16,996 --> 01:13:19,290
才开始而已
It is just beginning.

1517
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:21,751
你们的舞技变得...
Your dancing is becoming..

1518
01:13:21,876 --> 01:13:23,878
...很优秀
...so good..

1519
01:13:24,003 --> 01:13:28,550
我忘了告诉你们，很抱歉
'...that I neglected to tell you'

1520
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,539
and I am sorry for that.

1521
01:13:28,675 --> 01:13:31,428
要是有人想参加比赛
But if you really want to compete..

1522
01:13:32,262 --> 01:13:35,348
要费心练习才能赢
...you're gonna have to kick some serious ass to win.

1523
01:13:37,475 --> 01:13:40,353
这些学生都学了很多年
These kids have been dancing for years.

1524
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:44,607
本市还有更多人
And there is a whole city more

1525
01:13:44,732 --> 01:13:45,900
跳得比他们好
who are better than they are.

1526
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:48,570
对，那要我们怎样？
Yeah, so what the hell are we supposed to do?

1527
01:13:48,695 --> 01:13:50,572
让他们跌破眼镜
Surprise them.

1528
01:13:52,657 --> 01:13:54,701
每个人参赛都没抱什麽期望
Everyone competing expects nothing, nothing from you.

1529
01:13:54,826 --> 01:13:56,619
没指望你们怎样

1530
01:13:56,745 --> 01:13:58,496
你们不会有什麽损失
'So you have nothing to lose'

1531
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:02,000
只有目前为止的成就
'except everything you have achieved so far.'

1532
01:14:02,876 --> 01:14:04,836
我坦白告诉你们
Look, I'm being honest with you.

1533
01:14:04,961 --> 01:14:06,629
不管程度如何，比赛都很难
Competing on any level is tough

1534
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:09,466
好舞者会表现得轻自若
'and good dancers make it look easy.'

1535
01:14:09,591 --> 01:14:12,844
但我们现在的重点不是输赢
'So what we need to focus on now is not winning or losing'

1536
01:14:12,969 --> 01:14:14,971
而是要质疑
but doubting.

1537
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,891
不确定就坐下来
So if you're not sure, then sit down.

1538
01:14:18,016 --> 01:14:20,435
留在家e
Just stay home.

1539
01:14:21,978 --> 01:14:24,814
但只要看到一点点
But if somewhere you see a dot

1540
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:27,358
自己心e闪过一点信念
a glimmer of belief in yourselves

1541
01:14:27,484 --> 01:14:30,153
那你可能就有胜算了
then you might have what it takes to win.

1542
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:33,114
你真的这麽认为？
You really think so?

1543
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:35,075
对啊
Oh, yes.

1544
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,286
这是潜在最大的秘密武器
It is the strongest secret weapon there ever was.

1545
01:14:38,453 --> 01:14:41,164
对，有信心是好事
'Yeah, well, belief is fine and all'

1546
01:14:41,289 --> 01:14:43,917
但两百美元的报名费呢？
but what about that $200 entrance fee?

1547
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:45,335
我想相信什麽都可以
I can believe all I want

1548
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:48,630
可惜还是凑不出钱
but I still can't make a dollar out of 15 cents.

1549
01:14:48,755 --> 01:14:50,507
我会想办法解决
I'll find a way to handle it.

1550
01:14:50,673 --> 01:14:51,633
你会吗？

1551
01:14:51,758 --> 01:14:54,177
为了问题学生？

1552
01:14:55,678 --> 01:14:57,722
很奇怪
It's funny.

1553
01:14:58,515 --> 01:15:01,184
我环顾这个房间
I look around this room..

1554
01:15:02,143 --> 01:15:03,853
眼前只看到...
...and all I see is choices.

1555
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:06,231
...选择

1556
01:15:08,066 --> 01:15:10,568
等著被决定的选择
Choices waiting to be made.

1557
01:15:12,028 --> 01:15:14,906
没半个问题学生
Not a single reject.

1558
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,078
可能有一、两个猪头吧
Maybe a punk ass or two.

1559
01:15:22,205 --> 01:15:24,332
我要参加
I'm in.

1560
01:15:27,377 --> 01:15:29,379
怎样？
Well?

1561
01:15:29,546 --> 01:15:31,923
你们要不要？
You guys with me or what?

1562
01:15:54,571 --> 01:15:56,364
杜兰先生？
Mr. Dulaine?

1563
01:15:56,865 --> 01:15:59,117
詹姆斯校长找你
Miss James needs to see you.

1564
01:15:59,993 --> 01:16:01,745
詹姆斯校长
Miss James.

1565
01:16:03,538 --> 01:16:05,540
结束了
Terminated.

1566
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,668
这些是我班上学生的家长？
These are the parents of the kids in my class?

1567
01:16:08,793 --> 01:16:12,881
不是，这是家长教师会在开会
No. This is a meeting of the Parent-Teacher Association.

1568
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:17,886
你们都没亲眼看过我上课？
Oh.

1569
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:16,940
So none of you have even seen

1570
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:20,555
那不是上课，是留校察看
'firsthand what my class is all about, yes?'

1571
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,878
Okay, stop calling it a class, it's detention.

1572
01:16:20,722 --> 01:16:23,767
他们最需要帮忙，你却在教跳舞
These kids need help most of all

1573
01:16:23,933 --> 01:16:27,270
你有帮过他们吗？
and you're doing the cha-cha-cha--

1574
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:29,719
What are you doing to help them, Mr. Temple?

1575
01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:31,775
少假装你关心这些学生了
Don't pretend you care about these kids.

1576
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,693
丑话说在前头
Let's be clear here. What exactly is this about?

1577
01:16:33,818 --> 01:16:35,320
这是干嘛？

1578
01:16:35,445 --> 01:16:39,491
你是在用不实际的事浪费时间
What this is about

1579
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:40,396
is wasting time with something that is totally impractical.

1580
01:16:39,616 --> 01:16:41,576
这些学生何时要跳国标舞？
When are these kids ever gonna ballroom dance? It's ridiculous.

1581
01:16:41,701 --> 01:16:44,162
太离谱了嘛

1582
01:16:44,287 --> 01:16:48,083
套你的话，不实际的是差别待遇
It's impractical, as you say.

1583
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:50,168
认定某些学生有资格学艺术
It's creating a dividing line

1584
01:16:50,293 --> 01:16:51,836
值得你教导
where some kids are entitled to learn about

1585
01:16:51,961 --> 01:16:53,379
某些学生不值得
art and are entitled to your time and others are not.

1586
01:16:53,505 --> 01:16:57,717
拜，少废话什麽跳舞是你的命
Please, we've heard enough of your dance-is-life philosophy.

1587
01:16:59,594 --> 01:17:01,054
我懂了
I get it.

1588
01:17:01,179 --> 01:17:03,556
要做点什麽事
To do something, anything is hard.

1589
01:17:03,681 --> 01:17:05,517
不管什麽事都很困难

1590
01:17:05,642 --> 01:17:08,478
责怪家长和环境要简单多了
'It's much easier to blame your father, your mother'

1591
01:17:08,603 --> 01:17:10,188
责怪政府，抱怨缺钱
the environment, the government, the lack of money

1592
01:17:10,313 --> 01:17:13,024
但就算你们找到冤大头
but even if you find a place to assign the blame

1593
01:17:13,149 --> 01:17:16,152
问题还是解决不了
it doesn't make the problems go away.

1594
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,656
我在尝试新方法
I'm trying something new.

1595
01:17:20,323 --> 01:17:21,116
我在努力
I'm trying it.

1596
01:17:21,241 --> 01:17:24,077
你想谈我们的学生和我们的问题
You'll come to this school, tell us about our kids

1597
01:17:24,202 --> 01:17:26,788
用方块舞就能解决？
our problems and how you're gonna fix them with a box step?

1598
01:17:26,955 --> 01:17:28,832
不是
No.

1599
01:17:28,957 --> 01:17:30,917
我想证明给你们看
I'm just gonna show you. Uh, Augustine, please, could you?

1600
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:32,293
奥格丝婷，请你...

1601
01:17:32,419 --> 01:17:34,170
杜兰先生，这太荒唐了
Mr. Dulaine! This is absurd. Augustine!

1602
01:17:34,337 --> 01:17:34,796
奥格丝婷...
Joe, shut up. It's my body.

1603
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:37,340
乔，闭嘴，身体是我的

1604
01:17:37,674 --> 01:17:39,717
好了，放心吧
'Alright.'

1605
01:17:39,843 --> 01:17:42,637
只要动一动就好了
'Don't worry.'

1606
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:43,659
We're gonna just move.

1607
01:17:43,096 --> 01:17:44,889
很好，就是这样
Here you go.

1608
01:17:45,014 --> 01:17:46,641
很简单
Just like this. Very simple.

1609
01:17:46,766 --> 01:17:48,268
现在要走走路
And now we're gonna walk a little bit.

1610
01:17:48,393 --> 01:17:49,853
好，我们要走路了
Yes, we're gonna walk, we're walking.

1611
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:53,231
在走路吗？不对，是跳舞

1612
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:54,003
'Are we walking? No, we're dancing.'

1613
01:17:53,356 --> 01:17:55,859
你会走路就会跳舞
'So you know how to walk, you know how to dance.'

1614
01:17:57,777 --> 01:18:01,156
看吧？只要她让我带舞
Yeah.

1615
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:02,145
You see, if she allows me to lead

1616
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:03,700
就是信任我了
she is trusting me.

1617
01:18:04,117 --> 01:18:06,202
但不只如此
But more than that..

1618
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:08,621
她也信任自己
...she is trusting herself.

1619
01:18:09,914 --> 01:18:11,416
现在...
Now, if your 16-year-old daughter

1620
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:13,543
若你１６岁的女儿

1621
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:15,712
坚强又有安全感
'is strong and secure and trusts herself'

1622
01:18:15,879 --> 01:18:17,630
而且信任自己

1623
01:18:17,756 --> 01:18:21,843
她怎麽会莫名其妙未婚怀孕？
how likely is she to let some idiot knock her up?

1624
01:18:22,218 --> 01:18:24,053
只要你的儿子
'And if your son'

1625
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:27,098
能学会尊重地碰触女生
can learn to touch a girl with respect

1626
01:18:27,223 --> 01:18:31,436
他这辈子会怎麽对待女人？
how will he treat women throughout his life?

1627
01:18:34,481 --> 01:18:35,690
漂亮
- Beautiful. - Thank you.

1628
01:18:35,815 --> 01:18:37,192
谢谢你

1629
01:18:37,984 --> 01:18:39,527
有特定几位家长
We've got names on this paper of parents who have decided--

1630
01:18:39,652 --> 01:18:40,653
决定正式结束你的课程

1631
01:18:40,779 --> 01:18:42,072
各位女士先生...
So, ladies and gentlemen

1632
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:45,909
这是我在本校做的事
this is what I do here at this school.

1633
01:18:46,034 --> 01:18:47,744
我教跳舞
I teach dance.

1634
01:18:48,953 --> 01:18:50,872
顺便教一套规矩
And with it, a set of rules

1635
01:18:50,997 --> 01:18:53,625
能让你们的小孩
that will teach your kids about respect

1636
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,376
学会尊重别人

1637
01:18:55,502 --> 01:18:56,920
团队合作
teamwork and dignity.

1638
01:18:57,045 --> 01:18:59,172
还有礼仪

1639
01:18:59,297 --> 01:19:02,926
这样能帮助他们对未来有所展望
And that will help

1640
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:04,207
to give them a vision of the future they could have.

1641
01:19:03,093 --> 01:19:07,514
对未来有所展望
A vision of the future they could have.

1642
01:19:09,808 --> 01:19:11,726
有疑问吗？
Are there any questions?

1643
01:19:12,185 --> 01:19:14,938
你教不教成人？
Do you teach adult classes?

1644
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:22,387
教学中心应该可以代付报名费
I suppose the studio could cover all the fees.

1645
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,806
太好了
Great.

1646
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:28,518
你确定真的要这麽做？
Are you sure you really want to do this?

1647
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:32,481
TANGO
T-A-N-G-O.

1648
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:36,485
TANGO
T-A-N-G-O.

1649
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:40,405
我不管你是不是觉得这样很蠢
'I don't care'

1650
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:43,533
大声打拍子，感受节奏
if you think this is stupid, alright?

1651
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:44,080
Count it out so you can feel the beat.

1652
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:44,701
来吧
Let's go. Don't give up.

1653
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:45,619
不要停

1654

TANGO...
T-A-N-G-O.

评审会针对技巧
'They'll be giving you points on technique'

1656
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,336
风格和创意来评分
'style and originality.'

1657
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:56,630
最好快点熟悉舞步吧
Better get your program together now.

1658

T-A-N-G-O.

1659
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:02,803
你哪根筋不对？根本没试嘛
Danjou, what is wrong with you? You're not even trying.

1660
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,471
我不知道你干嘛浪费他的时间
I don't know why you're wasting my man's time.

1661
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:05,430
反正赢不了
- You ain't winning nothin'.

1662
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:08,016
少惹他，他快摸透了啦

1663
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:10,227
不对，摸得到的是我
- He's getting it. - No, homes, I'm gettin' it.

1664
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,064
让我来
I got it, Mr. D.

1665
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:17,359
你们怎麽搞的？两个都是大笨蛋
Both of you are so stupid.

1666
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:19,403
够了！
That's it!

1667
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:23,448
两个男生都不准参赛
You boys will be banned from the competition

1668
01:20:23,573 --> 01:20:25,534
除非你们好好相处
unless you can all work together.

1669
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:26,702
两个怎麽抢一个？
How are we gonna do that?

1670
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:30,038
从现在起，两个都是莎夏的舞伴
From this point on, you will both partner Sasha.

1671
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:33,041
平权决定谁跳什麽
You will equally decide who dances what.

1672
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:35,877
你们一起努力，一起想办法
You sweat through it, you work it out.

1673
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:39,881
请就位
'Positions, please.'

1674
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,552
来吧
'Let's go.'

1675
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:45,512
快点啊
Come on.

1676
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:48,223
猜猜怎麽著
Guess what?

1677
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:50,142

Hey.

你好啊
Hey, what's up?

1682
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:15,417
你在干嘛？
What you doing?

1683
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:18,587
只是想多练习一下
Just trying to get a head start

1684
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:21,089
回家还有一大堆事要做
because I've got math stuff to do when I get home.

1685
01:21:21,214 --> 01:21:23,634
等我喂完我弟弟
By the time I get my baby brother fed

1686
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,469
陪唐妮写完作业...
get Donny through his homework..

1687
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:28,847
家e就你和你妈在打理？
So it's just you and your mom handling stuff at home?

1688
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:32,100
你又想讲我妈怎样...
Look, if you're about to crack on my mom..

1689
01:21:32,225 --> 01:21:36,063
不是啦，我没有不尊重的意思
No, it's not even like that. I don't mean no disrespect.

1690
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:37,648
我之前是讲过你妈
What I said before about your mom, that was just before.

1691
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:40,817
那是过去的事

1692
01:21:43,153 --> 01:21:47,949
对，家e只有我和我妈在打理
Yeah, it is just me and my mom handling stuff.

1693
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:54,831
我和崔凡才１２岁，我爸就跑了
My pops left when me and Treyvaughn were 12.

1694
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:57,042
我妈肚子e怀著唐妮
My mom was pregnant with Donny.

1695
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,293
有段时间过得还好
We did a'ight for a minute, but..

1696
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,588
但最近几年

1697
01:22:00,183 --> 01:22:02,285
In the last few years

1698
01:22:01,713 --> 01:22:04,091
崔凡也得开始帮忙
Treyvaughn decided to start helping out.

1699
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:09,972
小雷被打死之前，我爸生病了
Before Ray got hit, my pops got sick.

1700
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:13,141
于是我就开始工作
So I had to start working.

1701
01:22:13,308 --> 01:22:15,268
你在哪儿工作？
Where you work at?

1702
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:19,189
只是帮我爸的朋友打点零工啦
I'm just doing some odd jobs for a family friend right now.

1703

乐芮！
Hey, LaRhette.

1704
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,622
你哥的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about what happened to your brother.

1705
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:38,709
我也是
Yeah, me too. For yours.

1706
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,544
对你哥的事

1707
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:56,059
怎样？你下礼拜六要比赛吗？
So what's the deal?

1708
01:22:54,537 --> 01:22:57,006
You going to the competition next Saturday?

1709
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:59,396
不能去，我要去社交舞会
I can't, it's the same night as my cotillion.

1710
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:01,940
社交舞会是什麽？
Oh..

1711
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:04,318
全世界的人都来看
What's a cotillion?

1712
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:05,781
A stupid dance where the whole world gets to look at you

1713
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:06,862
你有多逊脚的愚蠢舞会
and see what a throwback you are.

1714
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:09,865
别这样，你不是逊脚
Come on, now, you ain't hardly no throwback, Caitlin.

1715
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,411
有人陪你去社交舞会吗？
So do you have someone to take you to this cotillion?

1716
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:18,290
有，我的笨蛋表哥菲力普
Yeah, this stupid jerk cousin I hate named Philip.

1717
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:21,001
别理他，我陪你去
Forget it, why don't you just let me take you?

1718
01:23:23,503 --> 01:23:25,339
我很乐意
I'd love that, really, but..

1719
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:26,006
真的

1720
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,967
但恐怕不行

1721
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:32,387
我们放学后一起跳舞是没关S啦
I don't think I can.

1722
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:32,141
I mean, it's cool we dance together

1723
01:23:32,512 --> 01:23:36,516
但不可能有人理解
after school and everything

1724
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:37,313
but there is just no way anyone

1725
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:39,436
尤其是我妈
especially my mom, would understand.

1726
01:23:41,647 --> 01:23:43,732
好吧，没关S
Oh, it's okay.

1727
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:48,403
你要不要帮我练舞？
Would you be willing to help me practice for it anyways?

1751
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,619
* Can you Feel It in your body-ah *

1752
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:53,189
* Can you Feel It in your body-ah *

1753
01:24:53,256 --> 01:24:55,624
* 'Cause I can Feel It in my body-ah *

1754
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:57,860
* It feels good to my body-ah *

1755
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:01,530
* To my body to my body to my body-ah *

1756
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:05,000
* Body to my body-ah body-ah *

1757
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:07,170
* Da ba da da da da *

1758
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:10,105
* Da ba da da da da da *

1759
01:25:10,173 --> 01:25:12,475
* Ta ra ba doo be doo be *

1760

* La da da doo la da da da **

1761
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:19,536
黑眼豆豆合唱团的演唱
'Oh, yeah, Black Eyed Peas..'

1762
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,204
感觉一下，我感觉到了
'If you feel it, I can feel that.'

1763
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:24,082
８００千赫WLIZ，路况报导
'Traffic on the eights, on 800 WLIZ.'

1764
01:25:24,207 --> 01:25:26,168
现在是４点３８分

1765
01:25:26,335 --> 01:25:27,669
我有疑问
- Hey, I got a question.

1766
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:28,920
怎样？

1767
01:25:29,046 --> 01:25:30,839
你...
So..

1768
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:33,508
你要不要跟我一起参加比赛？
Are you gonna do the competition with me or what?

1769
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:37,304
皮耶要我跳华尔滋，我需要舞伴
Pierre wants me to waltz and I need a partner.

1770
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,139
你要我去？

1771
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:41,475
我不是在问你了吗？

1772
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:44,478
我想怎麽重要吗？
Why? Does what I want count now?

1773
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:46,438
不重要
No.

1774
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:49,900
你知道吗？
You know what?

1775
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:52,402
上场时看到他们的表情就值得了
It'll be worth to see their faces when we roll up.

1776
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:54,071
可能会把交响乐团藏起来
They'll probably hide the orchestra.

1777
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:56,531
会有交响乐团吗？
You think there's gonna be an orchestra?

1778
01:25:56,698 --> 01:25:58,909
会啊，大概吧
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

1779
01:26:26,982 --> 01:26:27,983
Oh!

1780
01:26:28,522 --> 01:26:29,272
是我不好
- My bad. - It's alright.

1781
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:30,732
没关S

1782
01:26:32,776 --> 01:26:35,112
你跳舞时看起来不一样
You know, you look different when you dance.

1783
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:36,530
怎样？
How?

1784
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:38,365
很平静
Like calm, like..

1785
01:26:38,782 --> 01:26:41,034
好像很安详
...like you're at peace or something.

1786
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:45,038
对，那是因为我跳舞时很陶醉
Well, yeah, that's 'cause

1787
01:26:43,466 --> 01:26:45,701
when I'm dancin', I'm in my moment.

1788
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:46,707
什麽意思？
What's that mean?

1789
01:26:46,832 --> 01:26:51,545
就是完全安静下来
It's just this place where it gets all silent

1790
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:53,964
忘了所有不好的事
and I forget about everything bad.

1791
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:56,300
感觉好舒服
And it just feels good.

1792
01:27:01,138 --> 01:27:03,307
好吧，来跳舞
Alright, come on.

1793
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:13,191
一、二、三
'And one and two and three..'

1794
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:15,277
来吧

1795
01:27:15,444 --> 01:27:17,112
来吧

1796
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,490
好，我来拿，别再这样了
Alright. Don't do it anymore.

1797
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:24,077
这是什麽鬼衣服？我不要穿
- Alright. - Don't do it anymore.

1798
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,839
This is like Elvira's dress.

1799
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:26,705
那是我的，小心点
- 'Those are mine. Be careful.' - 'Cool!'

1800
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,415
够炫！

1801
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,083
我不穿这件亮粉红色的
Not this bright pink one, I'm not!

1802
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:33,378
放下，不配我的礼服
Put that one down, because it does not go with my dress.

1803
01:27:33,503 --> 01:27:34,880
你很帅嘛
- You look good. - Hm.

1804
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:36,214
拜！
- Wow. - Hello.

1805
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,591
好性感！
- Sexy. - Hello.

1806
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,926
好了，试试这件
Okay, try this one.

1807
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:42,638
蒂娜
Tina?

1808
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,599
谢谢你
Thank you.

1809
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,366
* Let me tell them let me show them let me tell them *

1810
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,023
这件才对
* Ya yayaya yayaya *

1811
01:27:53,482 --> 01:27:55,317
好看
Fasten this up.

1812
01:27:55,484 --> 01:27:56,693
我喜欢
Nice.

1813
01:27:57,778 --> 01:28:00,197
你那样做她好著迷
'You know it kills her when you do that.'

1814
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:01,657
你说什麽？
What was that?

1815
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:03,617
蒂娜
Tina, the hand on the shoulder thing?

1816
01:28:03,742 --> 01:28:06,953
把手放在她肩膀上

1817
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:08,580
她好著迷
It kills her.

1818
01:28:09,706 --> 01:28:13,335
我知道你想聊天
Look, I know how you love to talk about

1819
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:15,087
谈爱情和魔法
romance and magic and two bodies

1820
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:18,006
两个人的身体合而为一
moving as one and everything.

1821
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:21,927
但我要你t解一件事
But let me see if I can make you understand something.

1822
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:23,929
她喜欢你
She likes you.

1823
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:29,351
你看看我在街上捡到什麽
- I found this on the street. - 'Eddie, Eddie.'

1824
01:28:29,476 --> 01:28:30,686
艾迪...

1825
01:28:30,852 --> 01:28:32,187
我只是闹著玩啦
I'm just playin'. These was on hold for my brother's wedding.

1826
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:34,356
这等我哥结婚再穿

1827
01:28:34,523 --> 01:28:35,440
要小心不能弄v
We've gotta be real careful with them.

1828
01:28:35,565 --> 01:28:38,527
不然我就完了，懂吗？
Get them back on time or my ass is family history.

1829
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:40,028
你们看我有什麽
Hey, look, what I got, yo.

1830
01:28:40,153 --> 01:28:41,154
"少年家"，可以拿吗？

1831
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:42,698
别闹了啦

1832
01:28:44,687 --> 01:28:46,822
Whassup

1833
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:51,623
就是你
- Ah! - Shoot it, shoot it!

1834
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,041
快投篮啊
Man, shoot it!

1835
01:29:03,885 --> 01:29:05,512
我去接你

1836
01:29:05,637 --> 01:29:08,181
等一下，你是说这礼拜六？
On Saturday? You said this Saturday?

1837
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,559
对，就是这礼拜六
Yeah, this Saturday, fool.

1838
01:29:12,352 --> 01:29:13,770
小心背后！

1839
01:29:13,895 --> 01:29:15,480
你看不到那麽远！

1840
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:17,024
投篮！
- 'Shoot it.' - 'He's being lazy.'

1841
01:29:17,482 --> 01:29:19,860
你到底打不打球？

1842
01:29:18,987 --> 01:29:21,390
'Yo, you playing or what?'

1843
01:29:24,823 --> 01:29:26,199
快点！跳投啊！
Get up, get up!

1844
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:27,367
可以啦

1845
01:29:27,951 --> 01:29:29,536
致胜的一分
Game point, game point.

1846
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:42,883
好炫的脚踏车
Nice bike.

1847
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:47,262
谢谢
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1848
01:29:47,429 --> 01:29:48,847
不客气

1849
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:57,124
第２５届国标舞大赛

1850
01:30:57,249 --> 01:30:58,041
大家好
Good evening and welcome

1851
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:02,462
欢迎光临第２５届国标舞大赛
to the 25th Annual Grand Ballroom Competition.

1852
01:31:02,587 --> 01:31:05,340
我今晚看到很多熟面孔
'I see many, many familiar faces here tonight.'

1853
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:06,883
还有很多黑人新面孔
And a whole lot of new black ones.

1854
01:31:07,009 --> 01:31:10,637
现在要暖身的话，请找个舞伴
'So at this time if you'd like to warm up'

1855
01:31:10,804 --> 01:31:14,558
和我一起踏进舞池跳集体华尔滋
please take a partner and join me on the dance floor

1856
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:17,853
今晚乐团指挥是法兰克劳伦兹
for our first all in waltz.

1857
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:16,839
'Our orchestra this evening'

1858
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,981
请给他们热烈掌声鼓励
'is under the direction of Frank Lawrence.'

1859
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:21,677
'Please give them a very warm welcome.'

1860
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:24,776
天哪，她知道她错了
Man, she know she wrong.

1861
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:27,487
但不得不佩服她，她真有一套
You oughta give it to her though, the girl is bad.

1862
01:31:27,612 --> 01:31:28,655
舞者准备好了吗？
'

1863
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:29,906
可以吗？

1864
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:48,967
我不知道这小子怎麽了

1865
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,179
他是我朋友，只剩十分钟了

1866
01:31:56,391 --> 01:31:59,478
伊西，我觉得不太对劲
Yo, Ease. This don't feel alright, man.

1867
01:31:59,603 --> 01:32:00,395
要是有人来...
- If somebody comes-- - You shoot 'em.

1868
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:04,399
毙了他们，我不是有给你枪吗？

1869
01:32:02,284 --> 01:32:05,487
What d'you think I gave you the piece for

1870
01:32:04,858 --> 01:32:07,235
我不对任何人开枪
I ain't about to shoot nobody.

1871
01:32:12,074 --> 01:32:14,451
你要一路陪他们玩吗？
So what you gonna do? Dance em' outta here?

1872
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:17,704
给我啦
Give me that back.

1873
01:32:18,205 --> 01:32:19,498
你想要开溜
If you're gonna punk out, punk out now.

1874
01:32:19,623 --> 01:32:22,959
就现在开溜吧，懂吗？

1875
01:32:21,637 --> 01:32:22,938
You understand me?

1876
01:32:24,127 --> 01:32:26,838
跟你哥一样没用
Like your goddamn brother, dude.

1877
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:30,509
他是因为落跑才被杀的
He got hit because he punked.

1878
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:32,552
不是我杀的啦
'Now I'm not sayin' that I did it.'

1879
01:32:32,678 --> 01:32:36,098
你想跟他一样吗？
So...you're gonna be like him, huh?

1880
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:39,888
Huh?

1881
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,563
不想
No.

1882
01:32:45,273 --> 01:32:46,858
那就好
Good.

1883
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,737
把你份内的事做好
Handle your business, man.

1884
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:59,788
下一项是莎莎舞
The next category will be the salsa.

1885
01:33:00,956 --> 01:33:02,374
舞者准备好了吗？
'Dancer's ready?'

1886
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:03,977
老兄，别激动
Whoa, dawg.

1887
01:34:04,102 --> 01:34:05,729
你想怎样？
Come on, man.

1888
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,710
What you gonna do with that?

1889
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:10,525
你干嘛那样？
What did you do that for?

1890
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,903
完成我哥没做好的事
Doing what my brother should've done when he had the chance.

1891
01:34:13,028 --> 01:34:14,446
去死啦！

1892
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:16,785
Kick your ass!

1893
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:17,532
我们快走！
Man, we gotta go.

1894
01:34:18,033 --> 01:34:19,493
快起来！

1895
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:23,038
你知道你惹了谁吗？
You know who you messin' with, son?

1896
01:34:23,205 --> 01:34:24,331
闪人！
- Let's go, Easy.

你知道你惹了谁吗？走开！

1898
01:34:28,669 --> 01:34:30,253
我要闪了！
Get off me!

1899
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:31,880
快点！

1900
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:35,676
你惹错人了啦
You messed with the wrong brother.

1901
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:38,178
别管那个笨蛋了！我们快走！
Leave that fool there. Come on man, let's go.

其他参赛者请离场
'All others, please clear the floor.'

1906

下一位初入社交界的少女
'Presenting our next deb..'

1907
01:34:55,904 --> 01:34:56,989
天哪，她来了
Oh my God. Here she comes.

1908
01:34:57,114 --> 01:34:58,949
凯琳史宾瑟
'...Caitlin Spencer.'

1909
01:35:01,201 --> 01:35:02,911
别怯场，千万别怯场
Don't freak out. Please don't freak out.

1910
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:04,329
别搞砸了
Don't screw up. Please don't screw up.

1911
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:05,539
千万别搞砸

1912
01:35:05,706 --> 01:35:06,665
千万别怯场...
Please don't freak out. Don't freak out.

1913
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:09,668
千万别怯场...

1914
01:35:09,793 --> 01:35:12,754
走到菲力普那儿，这样就好了
'Please don't freak out. Don't freak out.'

1915
01:35:10,272 --> 01:35:13,641
Just make it to Philip now. That's all you have to do.

1916
01:35:12,879 --> 01:35:14,589
菲力普人呢？
Where is Philip?

1917
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:18,093
千万别怯场...
Please don't freak out. Don't freak out.

1918
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:19,114
- 'Please don't, ah!' - Oh!

1919
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,893
他不是菲力普
That's not Philip.

1920
01:35:58,133 --> 01:35:59,718
来吧，我们走了
Now, come on, we've gotta bounce.

1921
01:36:01,762 --> 01:36:03,972
下一项是探戈
The next dance is the tango.

1922
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:05,515
所有参赛者请出场
'All competitors, please..'

1923
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:06,975
这次让我来吧
- I better take this one, son. - I got this. I got tango.

1924
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,310
不行，我要跳探戈

1925
01:36:08,477 --> 01:36:10,145
你又不会跳
Yeah, but you can't dance it, junior.

1926
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:13,315
你来决定谁比较适合
Look, Sasha, you decide who the better man is.

1927
01:36:13,482 --> 01:36:14,900
丹朱，我们走
Danjou, come on.

1928
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:18,820
各位请记住５千美元的大奖
'Remember, ladies and gentlemen'

1929
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,975
'that the $5000 grand prize'

1930
01:36:18,945 --> 01:36:23,116
将颁给任一回合最高分的一组
'is awarded to the couple scoring the highest'

1931
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:27,954
我会在结束前宣鸦袷ぷ楸
'in any single round.'

1932
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:25,881
'And I'll announce the winners'

1933
01:36:25,948 --> 01:36:29,017
'at the end of the evening.'

1934
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,791
现在是...探戈
'And now the tango.'

1935
01:37:19,923 --> 01:37:20,674
你还好吧？
' - I'm fine.

1936
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:22,301
我很好

1937
01:37:24,052 --> 01:37:26,680
我相信他不是无故缺席
I'm sure he's got a good reason.

1938
01:37:27,222 --> 01:37:29,641
我又不是为了他
It's not even about him.

1939
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:32,060
是我自己
It's me.

1940
01:37:32,185 --> 01:37:34,938
我觉得自己好驴
I feel so stupid.

1941
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:39,526
这辈子一天到晚出洋相
People have been leavin' me hangin' my whole life.

1942
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:42,362
搞不懂我怎麽会以为这次不一样
I don't know why I thought this will be different.

1943
01:37:46,742 --> 01:37:50,871
你真的让我相信可能出现奇
You really made me believe magic could happen

1944
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:51,599
anywhere, Mr. D.

1945
01:37:53,123 --> 01:37:55,584
但你讲的八成不是我吧
I guess you just didn't mean with me.

1946
01:38:15,103 --> 01:38:17,230
表现得很好
'Very well done.'

1947
01:38:18,106 --> 01:38:20,400
各位，请掌声鼓励
'Please show your appreciation, ladies and gentlemen'

1948
01:38:20,525 --> 01:38:22,277
在等待结果的同时
'for these wonderful dancers'

1949
01:38:22,444 --> 01:38:24,738
嘉奖这些优秀舞者
'as we wait for the results.'

1950
01:38:31,953 --> 01:38:34,206
１１１号
'Numbers 111'

1951
01:38:34,331 --> 01:38:37,209
以及２１３号两组入围
'and 213, stay.'

1952
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:40,003
其他参赛者请离场
'All others, please clear the floor.'

1953
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:41,880
１１１号
'Couple 111 took home the $5000 grand prize last year'

1954
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:46,093
去年抱回本项目的５千美元大奖

1955
01:38:46,218 --> 01:38:48,053
摩根费雪和崔维德雷克
'in this category.'

1956
01:38:48,178 --> 01:38:49,763
应该赢不了他们
'Morgan Fisher and Travis Drake.'

1957
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:51,682
抱歉，我不知道还能怎样
Danjou, I don't think we can beat them.

1958
01:38:51,807 --> 01:38:55,143
别再管他们，尽力表现就好了
I'm sorry, but I don't know what else to bring.

1959
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:56,098
Stop worrying about what they got and bring what we got.

1960
01:38:55,268 --> 01:38:57,437
和他们较劲的是２１３号
'Joining them is couple 213.'

1961
01:38:57,604 --> 01:39:01,650
丹朱艾斯和莎夏基恩
'Mr. Danjou Epps and Miss Sasha Keane.'

1962
01:39:01,817 --> 01:39:04,111
这是他们第一次参赛
'This is their first appearance at this competition'

1963
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:06,279
祝他们好运
'and we wish them well.'

1964
01:39:06,405 --> 01:39:07,072
现在...
'Now let's turn it over to Frank Lawrence'

1965
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:09,616
交给法兰克劳伦斯和乐团吧

1966
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:11,785
演奏今晚的探戈舞曲
'and the orchestra'

1967
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:13,745
探戈乐章
'with our tango selection this evening'

1968
01:39:12,847 --> 01:39:14,182
'La Cumparsita.'

1969
01:39:54,536 --> 01:39:56,079
什麽？
What?

1970
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:08,563
* Introducing the best of the best *

1971
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:10,465
* And when the kick drum kick and it's in your chest *

1972
01:41:10,532 --> 01:41:11,866
* And then it gets real deep within it *

1973
01:41:11,933 --> 01:41:13,468
* We gonna get 'em we shake *

1974
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:15,837
* And vibrate and take the rhythm *

1975
01:41:28,783 --> 01:41:31,353
* Work-work-work-work work-work-work-work *

1976
01:41:44,866 --> 01:41:46,000
Whoa!

1977
01:41:53,697 --> 01:41:55,657
我就是这个意思嘛
Now that's what I'm talking about.

1978
01:41:59,828 --> 01:42:00,954
谢谢
'Thank you.'

1979
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:03,290
谢谢各位
'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.'

1980
01:42:03,518 --> 01:42:04,486
Bravo!

1981
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:08,253
比赛很刺激吧？
'Well! Wasn't that exciting?'

1982
01:42:08,378 --> 01:42:11,048
听听评审们怎麽说
'Let's see what the judges have to say.'

1983
01:42:12,049 --> 01:42:14,968
评审给费雪小姐和德雷克先生
The judges have awarded Miss Fisher and Mr. Drake

1984
01:42:15,093 --> 01:42:17,804
各项都是满分１０分
straight 10s in all categories.

1985
01:42:23,977 --> 01:42:25,395
可惜...
Unfortunately, as this is a competition

1986
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,315
这是双人比赛，不是团体竞赛

1987
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:31,193
基恩小姐、艾斯先生和拉摩先生
'for couples and not teams'

1988
01:42:28,943 --> 01:42:32,947
Miss Keane, Mr. Epps and Mr. Ramos could not score.

1989
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,152
不能得分

1990
01:42:32,277 --> 01:42:33,320
什麽？

1991
01:42:33,487 --> 01:42:35,739
因此本项目由摩根费雪
'The round, therefore, goes to Morgan Fisher and Travis Drake.'

1992
01:42:35,864 --> 01:42:37,699
和崔维德雷克获胜
That's a bunch of bull!

1993
01:42:37,866 --> 01:42:38,825
他们得了满分
'This perfect score puts them firmly in the lead'

1994
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:42,996
再度稳坐今年的冠军宝座

1995
01:42:41,356 --> 01:42:45,193
'for the grand prize again this year.'

1996
01:42:44,539 --> 01:42:46,166
谢谢各位
'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.'

1997
01:42:47,376 --> 01:42:48,669
谢谢
'Thank you.'

1998
01:42:48,794 --> 01:42:50,921
费雪小姐，请吧
'Miss Fisher, if you please.'

1999
01:42:55,217 --> 01:42:57,761
这一回合算是平手
Let's call this round a tie.

2000
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:02,516
太好了，最好是平手啦
- It better be a tie. - A tie!

2001
01:43:06,603 --> 01:43:09,064
了不起，没见过有人那样跳舞
I've never seen anybody move like that in my life.

2002
01:43:09,231 --> 01:43:10,649
我想也是
I'm sure.

2003
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:16,446
你的表现令人赏
That was a very convincing performance.

2004
01:43:17,197 --> 01:43:18,824
我是职业的嘛
I'm a pro.

2005
01:43:20,701 --> 01:43:22,911
情况有出人意表的发展
- 'An unexpected development.' - Yes!

2006
01:43:23,078 --> 01:43:25,414
各位，本项目平手
'So, ladies and gentlemen, a tie.'

2007
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:28,709
今晚的大奖由两组平分
'The grand prize may be shared this evening.'

2008
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:33,380
看得出来，国标舞比赛绝无冷场
'Never a dull moment in ballroom dancing'

2009
01:43:33,007 --> 01:43:34,576
'as you can see.'

2010
01:43:37,843 --> 01:43:40,470
最后的比赛项目是...
Our final competitive dance is the waltz.

2011
01:43:40,595 --> 01:43:42,055
华尔滋

2012
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:11,209
抱歉
- 'Excuse me.' - 'I'm sorry, sir--'

2013
01:44:11,335 --> 01:44:13,128
我真的非进去不可
'I've gotta get in there. I'm in the competition.'

2014
01:44:13,253 --> 01:44:14,421
我要参加比赛

2015
01:44:14,588 --> 01:44:16,757
抱歉，我来处理
Excuse me, sir, look, sir.

2016
01:44:16,923 --> 01:44:17,799
谢谢你
I Thank you.

2017
01:44:17,966 --> 01:44:19,009
乐芮呢？

2018
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:20,469
乐芮...

2019
01:44:20,594 --> 01:44:23,930
我知道你在想什麽，但我出席了
Mr. D., I already know what you're thinking, man.

2020
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:26,308
我来了，你懂我的意思吗？
But I showed up.

2021
01:44:24,826 --> 01:44:27,595
I'm here, you know what I'm saying?

2022
01:44:27,017 --> 01:44:28,602
杜兰先生...
Mr. D., look, sometimes you talk about making choices

2023
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:31,146
有时候你到抉择之类的事

2024
01:44:31,313 --> 01:44:33,857
今晚我可能作错了选择，可是...
and everything and-and tonight

2025
01:44:33,982 --> 01:44:35,317
换上吧
I probably made a real wrong choice, but..

2026
01:44:34,936 --> 01:44:36,404
Here.

2027
01:44:43,367 --> 01:44:44,951
谢谢你，皮耶
Thank you, Pierre.

2028
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:52,417
准备好了吗？
You ready?

2029
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:48,974
皮耶，没想到真的有这种事
Pierre, I never thought it was possible.

2030
01:45:49,099 --> 01:45:51,101
坦白说，我也怀疑过
Honestly, Augustine, I had my doubts.

2031
01:45:51,226 --> 01:45:52,728
我费了很大的心力
It took a lot of work. But it was worth it.

2032
01:45:52,894 --> 01:45:55,105
但绝对值得

2033
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:57,774
我要感谢你让我这麽做
I've to thank you for allowing me to do this--

2034
01:45:57,899 --> 01:46:00,944
先别急著发表感谢词
Oh, don't start your thank-you speech just yet, Dulaine.

2035
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,196
我们要让你的课程变成常设
We need to make your program permanent.

2036
01:46:03,322 --> 01:46:06,074
要花费更大的心力
And it's going to take even more work.

2037
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:09,119
礼拜一早上９点到办公室找我
