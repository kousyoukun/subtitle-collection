1
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,189
Two men standing at the Pearly Gates.

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,158
The first man says,
"How'd you die?"

3
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,256
Second says,
"I froze to death.

4
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,392
How 'bout you?"

5
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,494
And the, uh, second man says,

6
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,906
"Well, I thought my... my wife
was being unfaithful to me,

7
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,671
- so I ran all the way home."
- Come on.

8
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,303
"And burst into the bedroom."

9
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,335
There's nothin' here.

10
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,370
- "She just..."
- Look over there.

11
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,404
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,350
Make sure there's men on...

13
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,943
Here!

14
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,419
We're here!

15
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,553
You take him first.

16
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,857
But, captain, he's as good as...

17
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,227
That's an order.

18
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,424
Sergeant.

19
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,132
Hey, watch it. Careful. Corporal!

20
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,468
Watch his leg.

21
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,662
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

22
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,005
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

23
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,510
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

24
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,514
Victory!

25
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,113
Getting a little ahead of ourselves,
don't you think?

26
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,282
Will, Lee surrendered to Grant,
so have a drink.

27
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,314
- Freddie, have you seen him yet?
- A dozen rebel armies still in the field.

28
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,758
I'd say peace is far from in hand.

29
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,658
Hamilton, you could put frost on a fire.

30
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,789
No, I haven't, but half his cabinet's here.
There's Interior...

31
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,800
and Postmaster.

32
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,299
Treasury.

33
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,633
Secretary of Navy.

34
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,366
Where's War?

35
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,839
Ooh, there he is.

36
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,102
God, what I would give to meet him.

37
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,804
What? Wait.
Where are you going?

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,947
You coming or not?

39
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,472
Are you... Are you mad?

40
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,747
You can't approach Edwin Stanton
without an introduction.

41
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,014
Really?

42
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,819
Frederick Aiken.

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,382
I've been to Creation and back
lookin' for you.

44
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,553
Senator.
Uh, Baker, Hamilton,

45
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,962
allow me to introduce the distinguished
senator from Maryland,

46
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,296
- Mr. Reverdy Johnson.
- Great honor, senator.

47
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,564
Gentlemen, you've done this nation proud.

48
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,900
Thank you, sir.

49
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:30,103
Ladies. Ladies, may I present
two genuine war heroes.

50
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,337
Now you all get acquainted

51
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,777
while I introduce the counselor
to some of my,

52
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,474
uh, esteemed associates.

53
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,504
- Ladies.
- Hello.

54
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,743
It's, uh, quite a turnout.

55
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,752
- Hello.
- It's an honor to meet the lovely...

56
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,481
Victory is like shit to flies, Freddie.

57
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,580
Why, Ed, what a delightful surprise.

58
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,388
Life's full of them, Reverdy.

59
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,055
This is our War secretary,
Mr. Edwin Stanton.

60
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,156
Yeah. It's a... it's a very great
pleasure, sir.

61
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,759
Mr. Aiken had two horses
shot from under him

62
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,201
and never quit the field.

63
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,234
Could use a loyal man like you
over at the War Department, Captain.

64
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,265
Sir.

65
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,175
Captain's back to bein' a lawyer.

66
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,238
Time to heal the nation, Ed,
not wage more war.

67
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,846
Pleasure as always, Senator.

68
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,375
- Captain.
- Sir.

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,253
I'm sorry you won't be able to meet
the president this evening.

70
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,484
Will he not be attending?

71
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,788
It seems Mrs. Lincoln
prefers an evening of theater

72
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,227
to a room full of soldiers.

73
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,634
Anything. I can play anything.

74
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,657
<i>Poor Blind Boy?</i>

75
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,033
I don't know that one.
Uh, anything...

76
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,059
Oh, thank you, Nicholas.

77
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,734
Sarah... oh, my God.
You look beautiful.

78
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,299
Sarah, glad to see you.

79
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,436
Fred didn't mention you'd be
joining us this evening.

80
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,845
- That sounds like Fred.
- What sounds like Fred?

81
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,439
Nothing you need to worry about.

82
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,312
How many bottles is that now, Nick?

83
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,048
Uh, nothing you need
to worry about, Fred.

84
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,487
Shall we take a stroll?

85
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,750
It's good to have you boys back.

86
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,317
It's good to be back.

87
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,296
It's very good to be back.

88
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,701
Oh, quite right.

89
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:15,077
Some gals and their mothers
would look...

90
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,296
Mr. Vice President.

91
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,323
Yes, Senator?

92
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,428
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,
but I need your authorization on this.

93
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,598
Is it really necessary right now?
I have so many guests.

94
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm afraid it's relatively urgent.

95
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,277
You have to keep the sun
out of your eyes,

96
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,336
look straight, pull strong,

97
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,369
calculate the distance,

98
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,609
and you'll hit the mark every time.

99
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,960
- What?
- Not sure.

100
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,055
Sir?

101
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,226
Yes, I have a package
for Secretary Seward.

102
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,532
We are old friends, Mr. Trenchard,

103
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,596
and you needn't be afraid of us.

104
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,038
I ain't afraid of you,

105
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,372
both of you together.

106
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,753
Want another?

107
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,389
Sir?

108
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,638
Secretary Stanton is a smart man.

109
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,374
The War Department
would be lucky to have you.

110
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,112
It was an honor to meet the man, but...

111
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,848
I'm eager to put the war behind me.

112
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,854
You do look awfully handsome
in your uniform.

113
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,163
I suppose I'm going
to have to get used to you

114
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,359
in civilian clothing again.

115
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,401
So you did miss me?

116
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,433
On occasion.

117
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,715
Now I've no fortune,

118
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,048
but I am filled over with affection

119
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,713
that I am ready to pour over you

120
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,350
like apple sass over roasted pork.

121
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,383
Mr. Trenchard!

122
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:45,227
You are addressing my daughter,
and in my presence!

123
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,894
Yes! I'm offering her my heart
and my hand just as she wants them,

124
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,301
with nothing in 'em.

125
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,741
Now, I'm aware, Mr. Trenchard,

126
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,006
that you are not used
to the manner of polite...

127
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,783
Pardon me. I'm sor...

128
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,852
Oh.

129
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,500
Shit.

130
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,644
- Oh, no!
- Hold it!

131
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,314
Stop! No!

132
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,819
No, please! Don't!

133
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,855
Ohh! Unh!

134
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,620
Help!

135
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,389
Somebody help!

136
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,399
Help!

137
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,266
...to which you have fallen guilty.

138
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,307
Well, I guess I know enough
to turn you inside out, old gal,

139
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,507
you sockdologizing old man-trap...

140
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,310
Ohh!

141
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,922
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

142
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,431
The South is avenged!

143
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,591
He's getting away!

144
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,225
Stop him!

145
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,198
Come on.

146
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,233
Come on.

147
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,870
Come here, you son of a bitch!

148
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,505
Can't get... let you out of here!

149
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,955
What is it?

150
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,559
- Major?
- What's happened?

151
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,586
Lincoln's been shot.

152
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,928
- What?
- He's been shot.

153
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,456
You stay here.

154
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,966
Open the door.

155
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,403
Sergeant.

156
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,428
Stand aside.

157
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,462
Over there.

158
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,338
Across the street.

159
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,207
Make way!

160
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,836
Please, stand aside.

161
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,039
Please.

162
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,573
Move back! Please!

163
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,491
- Coming through.
- Clear the way!

164
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,056
Back! Stand aside!

165
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,228
Can you see anything?

166
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,168
Open the door!

167
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,404
Open the door!

168
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,140
Try the other door.

169
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,807
Find another way!

170
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,309
Stand aside.

171
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,686
Over here!

172
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,492
Over here!

173
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,132
Come on inside!

174
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,973
Back here. Back here.

175
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,586
Set him down easy.

176
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,126
Where's the doctor?

177
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,355
Get some towels.

178
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,133
Mr. Secretary, wait, sir.

179
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,162
No. I want to see him.

180
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,005
Make way!

181
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,978
Out of my way!

182
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,071
Move aside!

183
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,713
Out! Move!

184
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,685
- Where is he?
- He's down there, sir.

185
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,821
There, sir.

186
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,629
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

187
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,139
Take his pulse.

188
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,925
Mr. Secretary, it was the actor,
John Wilkes Booth.

189
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,488
Are you certain?

190
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,291
They've performed with him many times.
They're positive.

191
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,590
We haven't done anything wrong.
It's gonna be all right.

192
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,505
Well, one man did not orchestrate
all of this on his own.

193
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,529
Where's Grant?

194
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,836
He's on a train to Philadelphia.

195
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,366
Bring him to me.

196
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,605
I want the commander
of the Union army here.

197
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,670
- Move.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,614
Put the forts on alert, all guns manned.

199
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,618
And find out which members of the Cabinet
are still unaccounted for.

200
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,849
Sir, we should move to the War Department
to facilitate operations.

201
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,057
- I'm not leaving him.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,353
Damn the rebels.

203
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,298
Damn them all to hell.

204
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,391
Mr. Secretary, sir.

205
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,095
Several names have come up, sir,

206
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,535
including an intimate of Booth's,

207
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,560
a John Surratt.

208
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,936
What is known of him?

209
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,372
21 years old, lives here.

210
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,501
His mother runs
a boarding house in town.

211
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,533
Find him.

212
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,045
I want the city closed.

213
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,376
If any of these assassins

214
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,177
get south of the Potomac
or up into Canada,

215
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,342
they will never be found.

216
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,612
Right away, sir.

217
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,745
Also the vice president wishes
to pay his respects.

218
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,517
When I say it is safe
for him to do so.

219
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,149
And keep him away
from the liquor.

220
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,216
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,726
Take that woman out,
and do not let her in again.

222
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,515
Let's go.

223
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,611
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

224
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,481
Move it!

225
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,720
Get up, you!

226
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,159
No!

227
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,189
Booth.

228
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,721
That's for the judge to decide.

229
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,519
Sir.

230
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,159
Well, nice of you
to show, Mr. Aiken.

231
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,169
I'm sorry for being late, Senator.

232
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,536
You aware the trial of the conspirators
begins today?

233
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,473
Yes, sir.
There's not a seat to be had.

234
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,373
Well, now you have one.

235
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,100
How's that, sir?

236
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,639
I've taken one of the cases,

237
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,978
and I want you
to be my second chair.

238
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,985
I thought the government
was planning a military tribunal.

239
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,646
Oh, indeed. Stanton has chosen

240
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,317
nine of his most loyal officers
to be judges, all for Union.

241
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,725
In fact, he's picked one of Lincoln's pallbearers
to head the Commission.

242
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,990
Uh, let's go.

243
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,327
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.

244
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,389
I might be being a little slow,

245
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,866
but won't the War Department

246
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,300
be handling the prosecution?

247
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,567
Stanton's most trusted
judge advocate general,

248
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,574
Joseph Holt, will be in charge.

249
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,269
Then what are we to do?

250
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,243
Defend one of the eight.

251
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,543
Defend one of the assassins?

252
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,243
Alleged assassins, counselor.

253
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,718
I had a letter from the lady this morning.

254
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,914
She runs a boarding house,
a Mrs. Mary...

255
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,944
Surratt?

256
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,048
Yes, that's it.

257
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,059
Sir, her son John was Booth's right hand.

258
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,359
Well, if they suspect her son,
they should try him.

259
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,729
[laughs] They would
if they could find him,

260
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,394
but they've got 250 agents
out looking for him.

261
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,564
She built the nest
that hatched this plot.

262
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,869
President Johnson said it himself.

263
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,706
Well, I know this goes hard
with you, Freddie,

264
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,041
but... but what they're plannin',

265
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,707
which is a military trial of civilians,

266
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,737
is an atrocity.

267
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,875
No, no. What she did is an atrocity.

268
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,215
There's no presumption of innocence,

269
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,187
no burden of proof,
no jury of your peers and no appeal.

270
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,554
All right, you were one
of Lincoln's pallbearers, too.

271
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,252
How can you represent her?

272
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,784
She's entitled to a defense, Freddie,

273
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,490
so I shall defend her.

274
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,763
Mary E. Surratt,

275
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,774
in aid of the existing armed rebellion
against the United States,

276
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,268
you are charged with having received,
entertained, harbored, concealed,

277
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,304
aided and assisted John Wilkes Booth,

278
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,182
John A. Surratt
and their confederates...

279
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,346
David E. Herold...

280
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,016
Lewis Payne...

281
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,289
George A. Atzerodt...

282
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,319
Michael O'L aughlen...

283
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,827
Edmund Spangler...

284
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,005
Samuel A. Mudd...

285
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,734
and Samuel Arnold...

286
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,867
in traitorous and murderous conspiracy

287
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,845
to kill then-President Abraham Lincoln,

288
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,642
Vice President Andrew Johnson

289
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,139
and Secretary of State
William Seward.

290
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,212
Pursuant to special orders
number 211 and 216,

291
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,120
how do you plead?

292
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,551
What say you, madam?

293
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,392
Guilty or not?

294
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,199
I am innocent.

295
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,432
In that case,
as each of the defendants

296
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,101
has entered a not-guilty plea,
we will begin.

297
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,043
Judge Advocate Holt,
please proceed.

298
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,270
Just a moment, Your Honor.

299
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,681
What is it, Senator?

300
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,685
I... I wish to request an adjournment.

301
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,688
An adjournment? We just got here.

302
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,816
My client has been in custody
for a month,

303
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,418
wasn't allowed to contact counsel
until yesterday.

304
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:34,694
General Hunter, a delay will only serve
to prolong the nation's sorrow.

305
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,893
My learned colleague,

306
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,232
you've had over four weeks
to prepare your case,

307
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,568
no doubt assisted by
the entire War Department.

308
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,939
I believe the defendant is entitled
to equal consideration.

309
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:49,608
Senator Johnson, our fellow citizens
must be permitted to put this tragedy to rest.

310
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,583
The sooner we dispose of this matter,
the better... for everyone.

311
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,745
Everyone but my client.

312
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,452
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.

313
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,857
In that case, I move for termination.

314
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,155
Termination?

315
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,993
On the grounds
this trial is unconstitutional.

316
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,862
The defendant is a civilian

317
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,630
entitled to a public trial
before a jury of her peers.

318
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,232
The attorney general has affirmed
the legitimacy of this proceeding.

319
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,709
Has he furnished a verdict as well?

320
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,740
Senator.

321
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,238
You will mind the horror
which summons us.

322
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,650
Indeed.

323
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,484
We all mourn the loss
of our leader,

324
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:34,219
but in our grief, let us not betray
our betterjudgment

325
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,659
and partake in an inquisition.

326
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,686
Inquisition? How dare you?

327
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,528
Sounds to me like we have
the enemy among us.

328
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:45,229
Maryland not being among our most loyal
of states during the war,

329
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,330
its senator ought to certify his allegiance
to this court.

330
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,308
I have served this nation
as its attorney general.

331
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,640
That is certification enough.

332
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,839
Nevertheless,
we may require counsel

333
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,974
to sign this oath of loyalty

334
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,779
as prescribed by Congress.

335
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,343
I am a member of Congress,

336
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,981
the same body that creates armies,

337
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,753
authorizes military tribunals

338
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,660
and makes major generals like you.

339
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,291
Our authorization comes
from the War secretary, Edwin Stanton,

340
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,301
and by order of the president.

341
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,738
If our founding fathers
had desired tyranny to prevail,

342
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,297
the president
and his War secretary

343
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,867
would have been granted
such indiscriminate powers,

344
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,879
but they drafted a Constitution

345
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,211
with laws against such powers.

346
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,048
They did so precisely for times like this.

347
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,492
Order! Order! Order!

348
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,589
I really want you to do this for me, Freddie.

349
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,690
You're not serious.

350
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,259
As serious as the charges
against our client.

351
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,895
Me? Defend her?

352
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,738
She doesn't stand a chance

353
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,043
with an old Southerner
like me defending her.

354
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,072
She needs a Yankee captain like you.

355
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,278
I'm sorry, sir. I... I can't do it.

356
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,877
No, you'll do fine, son.

357
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,114
Experience matters for nothing

358
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,521
when they're making up the rules
as they go along.

359
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,125
Besides, this government
has never executed a woman.

360
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,130
They've never considered a woman,
nor a man for that matter,

361
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,496
capable of murdering the president.

362
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,468
Sir, I can find you a rebel
to defend her,

363
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,437
but I ca... I won't do it.

364
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,371
There is no court in the Union

365
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,137
that would fairly judge that woman
with a Confederate counsel.

366
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,803
I won't betray my country.

367
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,210
I won't betray my friends
who died defending it.

368
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,216
I'm not asking you to betray
your allegiances, Freddie.

369
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,810
I'm simply askin' you...
rather tellin' you...

370
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:45,255
to obey your oath as a... as an attorney
and do yourjob.

371
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,295
He wants me to represent Mary Surratt.

372
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,161
What?

373
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,862
- What?
- Yeah.

374
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,634
He can't be serious.

375
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,503
They're the actors from the theater.

376
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,870
Open up.

377
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,617
Thank you, soldier.

378
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,246
That'll be all.

379
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,565
This conversation is privileged.

380
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,192
Sorry, sir. Orders.

381
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,465
Where is Senator Johnson?

382
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,674
The senator has instructed me
to handle your case.

383
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,879
You understand what you've been
charged with?

384
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,905
Conspiring to murder the president,

385
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,316
secretary of State
and the vice president...

386
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,286
if found guilty, you could hang?

387
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,885
No disrespect, Mr...

388
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,558
Aiken.

389
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,259
Mr. Aiken.

390
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,359
How many years have you?

391
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,593
27.

392
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,539
So you've handled cases
like this before?

393
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,736
There's never been
a case like this before.

394
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,574
But you have defended others.

395
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,314
They've left nothing to chance.

396
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,411
Very well.

397
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,384
You own a boarding house
on 541 H Street?

398
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,415
Is that correct?

399
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,688
Yes.

400
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,022
How long you been there?

401
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,993
Ma'am?

402
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,969
All I know about you
is what I read in the papers.

403
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,029
It's not flattering.

404
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,806
I moved to Washington a year ago

405
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,814
with my son and daughter
after my husband passed.

406
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,750
And the assassins were frequent
visitors to your home.

407
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,049
Yes.

408
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,282
Well, you... heh.

409
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,949
You don't even deny
having been acquainted

410
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,050
with John Wilkes Booth
and the others behind bars?

411
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,027
No, sir, I do not.

412
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,734
My husband died a drunk, Mr. Aiken,

413
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,565
and left me loads of debt.

414
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:22,266
I had to support my family,
so I rented rooms to boarders.

415
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,138
Those men were customers,
nothing more.

416
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,575
And you never considered
their allegiances?

417
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,079
I didn't ask about their allegiances.

418
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,911
What about yours, ma'am?

419
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,144
I am a Southerner.

420
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,482
I'm a Catholic

421
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,954
and a devoted mother
above all else...

422
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,658
but I am no assassin.

423
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:45,288
Your freedom is gonna require
greater assurances than that.

424
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,999
Then you tell me what I should say
to those generals.

425
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,666
Oh, you can't say a thing.

426
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,505
You're prohibited from testifying
in your own defense.

427
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,205
Perhaps your son could speak for you.

428
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,873
Any idea where he's hiding?

429
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,142
No, I don't.

430
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:10,110
All right. Is there anyone
who will give your version of events?

431
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,055
You mean the truth?

432
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,025
Well, obviously the government
believes your version is not the truth.

433
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,618
Based on what?

434
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,720
They're not releasing their list of witnesses

435
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,822
or the evidence they'll use against you.

436
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,492
And can they do that?

437
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,831
This kind of proceeding,

438
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,859
they can do to you
whatever they want.

439
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,701
Well, then what difference
does it make?

440
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,570
Those generals
have made up their minds.

441
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,411
I can tell by the way
they look at me.

442
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,175
The way they look at you?

443
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:40,048
Just the same way
you're looking at me.

444
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,217
I have to go.

445
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,587
Good day.

446
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,325
Mr. Aiken, I haven't a word
from my daughter since I've been here.

447
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,390
Would you look in on her for me?

448
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,867
I'd be most grateful.

449
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,403
Thank you.

450
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,863
Soldier.

451
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,924
Frederick Aiken,
lawyer to Mary Surratt.

452
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,164
It's perfect.

453
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,233
Pardon?

454
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,273
Anna Surratt?

455
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,009
My name is Frederick Aiken.

456
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,482
I'm representing your mother.

457
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,247
What's perfect?

458
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,944
Uh, nothing.

459
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,549
No, do tell.

460
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,755
I'm sure I've heard much worse.

461
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:34,128
Well, I was just thinking
that this would be the perfect place

462
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,860
to conspire to overthrow
the government.

463
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,925
No one would ever suspect.

464
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,061
Right?

465
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,129
You alone here?

466
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,505
Yes.

467
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,569
Why? Are you afraid
to be seen with me?

468
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,878
Your mother asked
that I look in on you.

469
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,250
Please tell her not to worry,

470
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,816
since I'm a prisoner in my own house.

471
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,681
Where's your brother's room?

472
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,489
Second floor, on the left.

473
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,738
Did you find what you were looking for?

474
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,574
Uh, yes.

475
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,585
Did your brother share a room
with an L.J. W?

476
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,348
Louis J. Weichmann.

477
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,251
He was like a son to my mother.
He'll swear she's innocent.

478
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,724
I suppose he's disappeared, too.

479
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,622
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Aiken?

480
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,831
Kill any on our side?

481
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,372
Miss, do you have any documents

482
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,399
indicating who stayed here
or a ledger of accounts?

483
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,444
Do you want me to help
your mother or not?

484
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,794
Is there anything else
you're concealing?

485
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,924
Such as?

486
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,627
Your brother, to start.
Look, if you know...

487
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,980
Did you see who threw that?

488
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,038
No, sir.

489
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,287
Are you hurt?

490
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,516
I'm fine.

491
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,692
Mr. Aiken, if you have no further
need of me...

492
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,022
Here. I'll give you two to sell.

493
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,120
You have the latest on this one?

494
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,425
That, I'll take two.

495
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,327
Cigars! Jars!

496
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,335
Picture frames!

497
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,996
Original, right here, ma'am.

498
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,471
Who wants a cigar?

499
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,201
Fresh roasted nuts here.

500
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,469
Fresh roasted nuts.

501
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,278
Move along.
Mustn't keep it blocked.

502
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:53,620
Thank you very much.

503
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:54,682
Left.

504
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,192
Left, right, left.

505
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,558
- Cigars!
- Left...

506
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:01,756
Cigars!

507
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,427
Left. Left. Left.

508
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,369
Left, right, left.

509
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,962
Left...

510
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,571
Company, arms rest.

511
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,440
- March.
- Shoulder arms.

512
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,776
Quick step.

513
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,213
Left.

514
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,443
Left, right, left.

515
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,748
A chance to get it back?

516
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:28,782
There he is.

517
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,225
- Fred.
- Hey.

518
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,855
Hamilton here has offered
to be your second chair.

519
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,888
Oh. Re... Not a chance in hell.

520
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,490
- No? You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

521
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,865
I'll carry his briefcase,
but I'm not...

522
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,168
- Sarah.
- Fred.

523
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,505
Why are you here?

524
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,442
I'm trying to understand
why you're here.

525
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,074
I suppose I should wish you luck.

526
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,462
Come to order.

527
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,959
How is Anna, Mr. Aiken?

528
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,025
She's fine...

529
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,794
looking forward
to when you come home.

530
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,576
That's very nice of you to say, Mr. Aiken.

531
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,480
Judge Advocate Holt,
will you please proceed?

532
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,485
In the matter of Mary Surratt,

533
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,955
the prosecution calls as its first witness
Mr. Louis Weichmann.

534
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,327
I thought he was like family.
Why are they calling him?

535
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,359
Place your right hand on this Bible.

536
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,394
I don't know.

537
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,339
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

538
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,501
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

539
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,532
I do.

540
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,602
Please.

541
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,045
Are you acquainted with the defendant,
Mary Surratt?

542
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,110
Yes. Yes, I am.

543
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,918
I attended Divinity College
with her son John.

544
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,083
And until recently,

545
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,716
you resided at the boarding house

546
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,624
owned by Mary Surratt.
Is that correct?

547
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,458
That is correct, sir.

548
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:18,158
Were any of these men
ever present in her home?

549
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,499
Yes, sir.

550
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,300
These three over there

551
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,399
on several occasions.

552
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:28,412
Let the record reflect
that the witness has identified

553
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,938
the prisoners Herold,
Payne and Atzerodt.

554
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,514
And who invited these men?

555
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,817
John Surratt.

556
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,880
Objection.

557
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,085
Objection?

558
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,822
Uh, uh...

559
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,887
There's no way to prove
that John Surratt

560
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,195
even knew these men,
let alone invited them.

561
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,796
Mr. Surratt's absence
from this proceeding

562
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,328
is Mr. Surratt's problem.

563
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,568
Objection overruled.
Continue, Mr. Holt.

564
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,176
Was John Wilkes Booth
also a frequent guest of John Surratt?

565
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,479
Indeed, but all the Surratts adored him...

566
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,077
John, his sister Anna
and their mother, too.

567
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,747
And were there ever meetings

568
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,518
held at the boarding house
involving Mr. Booth?

569
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:17,323
Many, sometimes lasting
two, three hours

570
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,091
and always in secret,
behind closed doors.

571
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,064
And did you ever see Mary Surratt

572
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,262
object to these, uh, meetings?

573
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,703
No, sir.

574
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,605
Or to the presence of those men?

575
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,699
No, she did not.

576
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,878
- Thank you.
- She appeared to welcome them.

577
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,078
Thank you. That'll be all,
Mr. Weichmann.

578
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:14,584
How long did you say these
secret meetings lasted?

579
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,849
At least two, three hours.

580
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,412
You were timing them?

581
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,193
Eh, if you were timing them,

582
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,525
I suppose these secret meetings

583
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,191
were not, in fact, kept secret from you.

584
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,460
I knew about them, sir,

585
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,968
but I had no knowledge
of what they were about.

586
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:35,597
And that is because you never attended
any yourself, correct?

587
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,402
Exactly.

588
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,933
Why was that?

589
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,003
I thought them suspicious.

590
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,446
Suspicious?

591
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,349
Well, then, you see, you did know
what they were about.

592
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,320
No, sir, I did not.

593
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,322
Then why were
your suspicions aroused?

594
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,950
By the snatches
of rebel conversation

595
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,928
I overheard in the hallways
and by their frequent whisperings.

596
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,832
Well, in that case, if it was
of such great concern to you,

597
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,769
why did you not report your suspicions
to your superiors at the War Department?

598
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,203
I did.

599
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,228
Excuse me?

600
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,604
I did reveal my suspicions.

601
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,008
I made a confidant of Captain Gleason
in the War Department.

602
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,784
Mr. Aiken, if there's nothing else...

603
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,689
Counselor, will that be all?

604
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:32,851
Uh, yes.

605
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,330
Uh, no.

606
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,461
No. No, I do have something else.

607
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,199
Tell me, Mr. Weichmann. Tell us all.

608
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,672
- You ever been in Richmond?
- Objection.

609
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,508
I merely wish to know if the witness

610
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,879
has ever visited the capital
of the Confederacy.

611
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,816
I don't recall.

612
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,252
Then perhaps this train receipt
will refresh your memory.

613
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,153
It indicates passage to Richmond,

614
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,057
and it has your initials on it.

615
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,021
Yes.

616
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,086
That's right.

617
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,729
I considered continuing my divinity studies
there after the war.

618
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,737
I plan on becoming a priest.

619
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,999
That's very nice.

620
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,007
Do you recall, Mr. Weichmann,

621
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,909
at which institute in Richmond
you were thinking of enrolling?

622
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:21,934
The name?

623
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,310
Yes, Mr. Weichmann, the name.

624
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,439
Well, uh...

625
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,211
- There is no academy of the kind...
- Objection.

626
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,615
...in Richmond, is there,
Mr. Weichmann?

627
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,516
- In fact, perhaps you visited Richmond...
- Objection, General.

628
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,850
...for another purpose entirely.

629
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,048
Objection sustained.

630
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,889
You worked for the general in charge
of rebel prisoners, did you not?

631
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,054
Yes.

632
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,120
So?

633
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,601
Perhaps a distinguished clerk like yourself
knew certain information.

634
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,125
What sort of information?

635
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,003
Information that might have been
of divine interest

636
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,564
to certain rebels within the capital
of the Confederacy.

637
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:52,598
Objection, General.

638
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,474
The witness is not on trial here.

639
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,036
Well, he ought to be!

640
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,138
Objection sustained.

641
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,774
The witness is not on trial.

642
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,116
Sir, I am merely trying to establish
the witness' credibility

643
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,088
or rather the lack of credibility
of this man.

644
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:09,183
Mr. Aiken, you are incriminating
the witness.

645
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,420
Incriminating? Sir,

646
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,089
Louis Weichmann shared a room
with John Surratt.

647
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,690
I have a ticket that puts him
in Richmond.

648
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,462
I think it reasonable to assume

649
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,163
that he knows more about this plot
to assassinate our president

650
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,762
than he supposedly reported.

651
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,239
What Mr. Aiken thinks
is entirely immaterial.

652
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,904
Counselor, unless you have something
more relevant to ask,

653
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,572
the witness will step down.

654
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,739
No.

655
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,911
No, I have nothing more... relevant to ask.

656
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,403
You never... you never ask a question

657
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,428
you don't know the answer to.

658
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,633
I know. I know.

659
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,542
How... How did you know Weichmann
was lying about Richmond, Fred?

660
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,205
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

661
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,339
S-so you gambled twice?

662
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,282
How did you pass the bar?

663
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,377
Well, Will, it worked.

664
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,787
I mean, Fred made Weichmann
look as guilty as the others.

665
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,484
- It was perfect.
- You're right.

666
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,293
And that's the problem.

667
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,828
They all look guilty.

668
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:20,989
Freddie, I'm sorry.

669
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,226
First the senator drops your client
like a load,

670
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,633
and then with all these
secret meetings taking place,

671
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,700
either she knew what was going on...

672
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,002
Or she damn well should have known.

673
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,404
Senator?

674
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,144
In here.

675
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,823
I think she's as guilty as Booth.

676
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,852
How could I possibly defend her?

677
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,967
You assume that she's guilty,
like the Commission.

678
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,663
You don't have any proof.

679
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:00,829
Proof or no,

680
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,536
don't give a damn what happens to her.

681
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,208
I tell you what.

682
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,238
If you can prove that she's guilty,

683
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,580
you can take yourself off the case.

684
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,245
Thank you, sir.

685
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,948
You think it'll be that easy?

686
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,422
I know it.

687
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,099
Pardon me, Father.

688
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,401
I wish to confer with the prisoner.

689
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,237
Alone, if you don't mind.

690
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,072
It's... It's quite all right, Mary.

691
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,738
I... I must be going anyway.

692
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,408
All right. Well, thank you
for visiting, Father.

693
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,349
I'll see you soon.

694
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,784
Your words were most comforting.

695
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,185
The Lord's with you.

696
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,125
She's refusing to eat.

697
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,363
I've tried to convince her to no avail.

698
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,235
Perhaps you could help her.

699
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,212
"Search me, and know my heart.

700
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,214
"Try me, and know my thoughts.

701
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,348
And see if there be any wicked way in me."

702
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,223
"The Lord knows the way of the wicked.

703
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,020
And the way of the wicked will perish."

704
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,391
You know your Proverbs, young man.

705
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,896
My father was a minister.

706
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,865
He taught them to me as a child.

707
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:43,270
So, what is it you wish to know?

708
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,435
Why Booth and his associates
were constants in your home.

709
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,002
I ran a boarding house, Mr. Aiken.

710
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,345
Forgive me if I chose
to fill it with boarders.

711
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,043
I checked your registry, ma'am.

712
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,780
There's no record Booth ever
stayed at your home.

713
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,449
No, the fact is he stayed at the National
whenever he came to Washington,

714
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,483
so why was Booth in your home?

715
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,826
I suppose my son invited him.
They were friends.

716
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,025
Famous actor like Booth?

717
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,057
Engaging your son
out of friendship?

718
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,434
Mr. Aiken, my son is no less
a gentleman than you

719
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,929
and very capable of forming
acquaintances in society.

720
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:21,206
I've... I've read all about
your family's acquaintances, ma'am,

721
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:26,205
about how your late husband contributed
to the Confederate cause

722
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,081
and about your Gentleman Johnny.

723
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,018
What about him?

724
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:35,047
He made quite a sum as a courier
carrying rebel secrets across Union lines.

725
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,855
Oh, I'm well aware

726
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,522
of what your family's capable of,
Mrs. Surratt,

727
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:43,329
so I know you're not
telling me the truth.

728
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,801
Well, then you know what I do not.

729
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,100
You were despondent
over losing the war,

730
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,107
and you would have done anything
you could to save the Confederacy,

731
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,631
including using your own son John.

732
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:53,904
Honestly, Mr. Aiken.

733
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,208
So you arranged a meeting with Booth,

734
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,305
figuring he'd befriend your son
because of what he knew,

735
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,781
what expert couriers do know.

736
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,217
And what might that be?

737
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,345
The best escape routes out of town.

738
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:09,287
Your son was supposed to lead the others
to freedom that night, wasn't he?

739
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,419
Except he was the only one
that got away.

740
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,588
My son was in Canada that day.

741
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:15,928
Can you prove that?

742
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,833
I received a letter on April 14,

743
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:22,305
same day as the assassination,

744
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,068
sent from Montreal.

745
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,098
Where is this letter?

746
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,701
I don't know.

747
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,575
I'm done,

748
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,910
done defending your lies.

749
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,212
You're so blind with hatred, Mr. Aiken,

750
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,649
you can't even see the truth.

751
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,314
Yes, my son hated the North.
We all did.

752
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:42,155
How can a Southerner feel anything
but bitterness toward your side?

753
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,161
But my son did not conspire
to kill your president.

754
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,690
He conspired to kidnap him.

755
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,405
All right, here he comes.

756
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,342
Ready your mount.

757
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,005
Surratt, where the hell's Booth?

758
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,570
He'll be here.

759
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,984
All right, steady.

760
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,689
Wait!

761
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,024
He's not coming!

762
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,891
Lincoln's changed his plans.

763
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,695
- What?
- He's still in town.

764
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,827
He just gave a speech
at the National.

765
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,976
Anna, back upstairs.

766
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,955
Who was in the carriage?

767
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,896
Doesn't matter. What matters
is he wasn't in the carriage.

768
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,921
You should have known.

769
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:56,955
What about the weapons?

770
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,228
We need to hide these weapons.

771
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,462
We can take them to Lloyd's.

772
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,492
I'll take 'em.

773
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,027
You'd shoot your own foot off.

774
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,096
I said I'd do it.

775
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,232
Don't push me.

776
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,866
Enough!

777
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:09,106
Fools like you are the reason
we can lose this fight.

778
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,880
Johnny Surratt,
I'd like a word with you, please.

779
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,915
Well, answer, Johnny.
Your mama's callin'.

780
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,189
They planned on ransoming
Lincoln in exchange

781
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,258
for all the Confederate soldiers
in your prisons.

782
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,826
Why didn't you report them
to the authorities?

783
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,430
Because one of them was my son.

784
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,701
So rather than kidnap him,

785
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,436
your son helped murder
the president instead.

786
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,465
No.

787
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,377
They nearly got the vice president
and the secretary of State.

788
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,937
No, it's not true. It's not my Johnny.

789
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,177
Damn it, ma'am, you just said
he was Booth's right hand.

790
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,845
My son is not a murderer, Mr. Aiken.

791
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,751
All right, then.

792
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,380
Swear to it.

793
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,552
Supper will be ready shortly.

794
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,022
John?

795
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,124
Can't stay, mama.

796
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,260
I have to leave town straightaway.

797
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,634
What's so pressing?

798
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,366
Nothing that need worry you.

799
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,136
Just some cotton speculatin'. T hat's all.

800
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,302
Don't sport with me, son.

801
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,403
You're not steppin' outside this house.

802
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,437
Don't talk to me like I'm a child!

803
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,882
Richmond's falling.
Something must be done.

804
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:24,080
Johnny, I'm aware of the news
from Richmond,

805
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,089
and it pains me terribly.

806
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,181
Supper's ready.

807
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,125
Wh-what is it?

808
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,149
I'm leaving town.

809
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,627
No, you're not leaving town.

810
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:33,651
Yes, I am.

811
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,324
You and Anna are the only family I've got left,

812
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,925
and I'll be damned if I let you go out there
and do something else foolish.

813
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,094
- Foolish?
- Johnny...

814
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,331
What I'm fightin' for is far more important
than any of us.

815
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,100
Your family is more important
than anything.

816
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,266
That is your responsibility!

817
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:47,333
All of our men are buried underground
right now.

818
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,810
- The war is over.
- Oh, you're wrong about that.

819
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,278
There is nothing left for you to do.

820
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,110
The war is far from over,
and there's still plenty I can do.

821
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,343
- Johnny, please.
- Unhand me, Mother.

822
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,577
- Unhand me, Mother.
- Please, Anna.

823
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:55,915
John!

824
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,419
Mother.

825
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,081
John, are you coming or not?

826
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,316
Johnny, please.

827
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,417
If this cause ain't worth fightin' for,
then what is?

828
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,830
So that was the last time
you saw your son?

829
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:08,956
Yes.

830
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,967
Less than two weeks
before the assassination?

831
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:11,990
Yes.

832
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,764
So then, you see, you admit

833
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,136
that your son conspired to kill
President Lincoln.

834
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,266
I don't know.

835
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,868
May God help you.

836
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,278
Honestly, Mr. Aiken, I don't know.

837
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,978
Lord, I pray not.

838
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:35,390
All I know is that I did not.

839
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,895
I swear.

840
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,718
Miss Surratt.

841
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,917
You have to tell me exactly...

842
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,946
How is my mother?

843
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,652
She's managing.
You have to tell me

844
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:10,682
exactly what happened here.

845
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:11,887
What do you mean?

846
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,055
Do you know that Louis Weichmann,
uh, your friend,

847
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,088
testified against your mother

848
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,567
after you told me
he was like a son to her?

849
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,498
What went on here?

850
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,062
Why should I trust you?

851
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,937
Because your mother
told me everything.

852
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,738
She told me about John.

853
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,846
She told me about the plot to kidnap
President Lincoln.

854
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:37,444
Anna, did you try and stop him?

855
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,455
How was I supposed to do that?

856
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,854
'Cause you're his older sister.

857
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,086
You don't know how stubborn
my brother can be.

858
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,527
All right. Did your brother
conspire to kill the president?

859
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,394
My brother left town weeks
before the assassination.

860
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,898
It proves nothing. Look, the night
he left the boarding house...

861
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:50,922
I've said all I will.

862
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,628
Miss Surratt, I'm trying...

863
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,069
I'm trying to help.

864
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,198
By condemning my brother?

865
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,233
Mr. Aiken, my mother would never
allow that, and neither would I.

866
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:05,146
Oh. All right. All right, look,
you knew about Weichmann.

867
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,913
If you know any potential witnesses
the prosecution might call

868
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,250
or what evidence
they'll use against her,

869
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,619
you must tell me.

870
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,458
Will you help me?

871
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,560
Let us proceed with events

872
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,587
following the assassination
of President Lincoln.

873
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,326
On the night of April 17,

874
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,061
what were your duties, Major Smith?

875
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,001
I was charged with finding John Surratt,

876
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,097
and we were searching the house.

877
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,869
Major, I found these.

878
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,604
They were here
in the daughter's bedroom.

879
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:47,621
Major Smith, please read aloud
what's inscribed here.

880
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,488
<i>"Sic semper tyrannis."</i>

881
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,256
Could you translate?

882
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,354
Of course.
"Thus always for tyrants."

883
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,126
Are those words familiar to you?

884
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,360
Indeed.

885
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,369
Booth yelled them
after he cut down our president.

886
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,167
You found the same three days later

887
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,606
in her daughter's bedroom
next to a photograph

888
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,870
of the assassin himself.

889
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,771
Like a shrine, sir.

890
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,178
Uh...

891
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,772
Please continue.

892
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,182
Uh, objection.

893
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,153
<i>Sic semper tyrannis</i>
is the state motto of Virginia.

894
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,157
It hardly constitutes proof
of a shrine to Booth.

895
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,284
No further proof is needed,
Mr. Aiken.

896
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,486
Proceed, Mr. Holt.

897
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,260
Continue, Major Smith.

898
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,732
As I was fixing to take the Surratts
to headquarters for questioning,

899
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,394
there was a knock at the door.

900
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,527
You all right, ma'am?

901
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,677
I... I must be mistaken.

902
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,651
Wait a minute.

903
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,984
Whom do you wish to see?

904
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,751
Uh, Mrs. Surratt.

905
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,020
This is her place.
Bring him in.

906
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:06,758
Is she expecting you?

907
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,171
She sent for me, asked me
to dig a gutter for her.

908
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,673
At this time of night?

909
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:15,235
In the morning. I just wanted
to know what time.

910
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,270
Bring Mrs. Surratt in here.

911
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:26,783
Ma'am, did you hire this man
to dig a gutter for you?

912
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,548
No, sir.

913
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,059
Do you know this man?

914
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,766
No, sir.

915
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,300
Is this the man
she denies knowing?

916
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,898
No, sir.

917
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,240
Is this the man
she denies knowing?

918
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,748
Yes, sir.

919
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,550
Lewis Payne.

920
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,520
The same man boarded at the Surratts'

921
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:03,720
prior to daggering the secretary of State
and his kin.

922
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,022
Yes.

923
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,154
Thank you, Major.
Nothing further.

924
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:29,608
Major Smith, are you aware
that Lewis Payne

925
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,950
boarded at the Surratts' under an alias,

926
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:35,082
claiming to be a Baptist minister
from Baltimore named Wood?

927
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,854
That's what she claimed.

928
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,882
She claimed?

929
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:43,365
I would like to submit into evidence
this ledger of guest accounts

930
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,425
from the Surratt boarding house.

931
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:49,427
Supposing, as this evidence would seem
to suggest, that that were the truth...

932
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,406
suppose Mrs. Surratt simply failed that night

933
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,068
to recognize Wood the preacher

934
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,669
in the guise of Payne the ditch digger.

935
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:59,512
He was standing in full view of her
not three paces.

936
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:04,086
General Hunter, since accepting this case,

937
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,614
I have come to learn that my client's
eyesight is defective.

938
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:13,095
I have here a sworn affidavit
from her doctor stating just that.

939
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,690
Major Smith, it was dark.
It was nighttime.

940
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:20,362
Isn't it possible Mary Surratt simply...

941
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,893
failed to see him?

942
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,598
If I saw a man dressed as a preacher

943
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,370
and two months later a laborer,

944
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,809
then I would recognize him
as the same person.

945
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:29,834
Thank you, Major Smith.

946
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,972
A simple yes or no will do.

947
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,745
Is it possible she failed
to see him properly?

948
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,185
Yes, I suppose it's possible.

949
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,188
No further questions.

950
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:43,215
The prosecution seems unable
to present any proof of guilt

951
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,284
beyond a reasonable doubt.

952
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:58,566
Uh, could somebody bring me
the transcript of today's trial?

953
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,371
Shall I read it aloud to you?

954
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,434
Oh, Ed.

955
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,580
Your young associate is
putting up a spirited defense.

956
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:10,916
Reminds me of a certain lawyer
I had to face 25 years ago.

957
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,286
Ah, he learned to fight in your army.

958
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,086
Can I get you a drink?

959
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:18,116
No, no. No, I won't be staying long.
Reverdy...

960
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,298
You've done as much for this nation
as any man I know.

961
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,065
Oh. Feeling's mutual, Ed.

962
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:32,200
Don't you think it's time for us two
old war horses to call a truce?

963
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,673
Not if you insist on staging
this travesty.

964
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,807
This trial will do more
to keep the peace

965
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,817
than any paper treaty could.

966
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,285
Heh. How'd you convince
yourself of that?

967
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,880
Because justice, swift and firm,

968
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,892
will help deter the South
from ever conspiring again,

969
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:52,895
as well as discouraging the North
from seeking revenge.

970
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,829
What about the rule of law?

971
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,732
My first responsibility is to ensure
that this war stays won.

972
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,030
Oh, and this is how you do it,

973
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,537
by keeping fear alive
as long as you see fit?

974
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,473
Look. " Stanton warns
of future rebel plots,"

975
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:08,102
uh, water supplies poisoned, um...

976
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,305
firebombing cities.

977
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,372
Uh, yellow fever spreading
all over the place.

978
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,112
This is a frightened country, Ed.

979
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:17,676
You don't need to scare us anymore.

980
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,086
And who is to say that none
of these things could happen?

981
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,958
The unspeakable already has...

982
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:26,223
Our president assassinated,
600,000 dead.

983
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:28,093
The world has changed, Reverdy.

984
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:32,329
Abandoning the Constitution
is not the answer.

985
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,599
You may prefer dining alone.

986
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,667
I just hope your young associate
does as well.

987
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,303
If he pushes too hard,

988
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,144
he will make enemies
who will not soon forget.

989
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,948
On this, you know I'm right.

990
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,417
I'm here to see Secretary Stanton, boys.

991
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,983
Stand down.

992
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,694
Sorry, sir. Mr. Stanton doesn't see anyone
without an appointment.

993
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,287
Well, good morning, Mr. Aiken.

994
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,321
Morning.

995
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,597
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

996
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,161
If you can arrange an appointment
for me with the secretary, you can.

997
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,332
Unfortunately he's quite busy right now,

998
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,535
but perhaps you'd care
to have a word with me instead.

999
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:48,938
Please.

1000
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,680
My client is unwell.

1001
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,207
So I hear.
Touch of the woman's curse.

1002
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:59,619
I'm sure she'll be well enough
to continue her trial in a few days.

1003
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,954
She's been in solitary confinement
for over a month.

1004
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,084
She hasn't eaten in over a week.

1005
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,287
She's refusing to eat.

1006
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,296
All the prisoners are fed daily.

1007
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,627
Soft bread and salted meat.

1008
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,099
Unless she has a proper meal
and some fresh air,

1009
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,965
I can't guarantee
she'll be fit for trial.

1010
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,199
One of the conspirators
refuses to be guarded by a Negro,

1011
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,639
and the other insists on only eating
his mother's cooking.

1012
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,869
We can't accommodate every whim.

1013
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:23,470
Come now. I am merely asking for you
to stop treating her like a savage.

1014
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,545
How dare you accuse us of savagery?

1015
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,312
Have you forgotten how our own
were treated by the rebels?

1016
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,342
Of course not.

1017
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:32,376
Well...

1018
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,220
But Mary Surratt is in serious decline.

1019
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:38,921
If this treatment of her continues,
she will not be sound of mind.

1020
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,556
And I trust that is something
the government wishes to avoid.

1021
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:49,001
I may have a way to serve all interests.

1022
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:53,134
I'll deny ever telling you this.
Understood?

1023
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,952
Father.

1024
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,018
Counselor.

1025
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,460
Feel that sun.

1026
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,664
Do I have you to thank for this?

1027
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,873
Well, thank you.

1028
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:33,279
Well, if I could just get you
to start eating.

1029
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,742
Left. Left.

1030
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,151
Left, right, left.

1031
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,280
Company halt.

1032
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,723
Mary, there's something
I need to ask you.

1033
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,954
I've never seen you at a loss for words,
young man.

1034
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,060
Do you know where your son is hiding?

1035
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,161
Johnny?

1036
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,262
Of course not.

1037
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,796
Government believes you do.

1038
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,477
What do you believe?

1039
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:08,817
I believe you know more
than you're willing to tell me.

1040
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:15,518
Uh, have you ever cared for something
greater than yourself?

1041
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,395
I've spent these last four years

1042
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,829
fighting for something
greater than myself,

1043
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,696
so don't...

1044
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,429
Then we are the same.

1045
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:37,512
Mary, you have to tell us
where your son is.

1046
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,209
Us?

1047
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,444
I have to tell "us"?

1048
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,952
Whose side are you on?

1049
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,453
I'm trying to defend you.

1050
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,616
By suggesting I trade
my son for myself?

1051
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:53,119
You're trying to save you, Mr. Aiken.

1052
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:56,962
I wish I could give you
what you need. I truly do.

1053
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,457
But if you want out,
you'll have to find another way.

1054
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,405
I'm gonna take a walk.

1055
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,740
It's so nice out.

1056
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,110
Do you care to walk with me?

1057
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,074
So we're stuck
in these shallow trenches.

1058
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,278
We're surrounded on all sides.

1059
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,117
Nobody knows what to do.
Nobody knows what to say.

1060
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,316
We're frozen,
completely petrified.

1061
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,847
And then from somewhere
up on the hill,

1062
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,053
we hear this loud
booming Southern voice.

1063
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,322
It's the rebel general.

1064
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,592
He yells, "Y'all boys
better say your prayers,

1065
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,122
because there are 400 of us
and only 100 of you."

1066
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,498
You can stop right there, Baker.

1067
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,730
And so then this madman,
he stands up,

1068
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,965
and he yells back to him,
and he says...

1069
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,167
he says, " Hundred?
Heck, we've got less than that.

1070
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,369
But we don't surrender,
so come and get us."

1071
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,434
And with that,

1072
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,844
he pulls down his pants
and bares his arse.

1073
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,538
You didn't.

1074
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,676
- I didn't.
- What?

1075
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,688
It doesn't seem as though Fred
ever intends to surrender.

1076
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,451
Ah, it appears he already has.

1077
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,288
She's fair, fit and 40.

1078
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,793
Is it true Mrs. Surratt is a Catholic,

1079
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,593
wears black from head to toe?

1080
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:06,124
I hear she spits in the faces
of every Union soldier she encounters.

1081
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,296
Apparently she wears a necklace
made from the bone of a Union soldier.

1082
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,330
Seriously, Fred, do you honestly
doubt she's guilty?

1083
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,180
So, okay, who would like to dance?

1084
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,149
- Yes.
- Yes. Good.

1085
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,466
Dance?

1086
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,128
It's more like a wake.

1087
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,660
I suppose I should have dressed
more like Mrs. Surratt.

1088
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,003
Fred, what are you doing?

1089
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:50,308
I'm enduring the pain
of having to listen to Baker.

1090
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,540
You know what I mean.

1091
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:55,048
If she's found guilty,
they'll say you weren't up to the task.

1092
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,242
And God forbid you prevail.

1093
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,347
They'll think you just as much
a traitor as she.

1094
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,689
Baker, how 'bout something
a little happier?

1095
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:07,723
- Little happier?
- Yeah.

1096
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:10,630
All right, Fred.
Happier, he wants.

1097
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,035
William's right, you know.

1098
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,374
Either outcome, you cannot prevail.

1099
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:23,810
Sarah.

1100
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:27,680
What is it about Mary Surratt
you find so compelling?

1101
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:31,380
These are criminal,
despicable people, Fred.

1102
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,682
They're... they're
the same sort of people

1103
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,690
you risked your life
fighting against,

1104
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,851
and she helped kill
your commander in chief.

1105
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,792
I don't know what she's guilty of.

1106
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,366
May I ask you one more thing?

1107
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,460
What is it, Sarah?

1108
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,472
Does the captain
remember how to dance?

1109
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:55,901
Of course.

1110
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,882
Few people will forget
what side you fought on.

1111
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:07,787
Trust me. It can be lonely.

1112
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,848
I'm just upholding my oath
as an attorney

1113
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,951
and doing my job.
It's what you asked.

1114
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,825
It's what you told me to do.

1115
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:17,230
This habit of quoting me back to me
could become most irritating.

1116
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:20,667
You have your mother's convictions
and your father's annoying habits.

1117
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,900
Well, " Mary Surratt is entitled
to a defense, Freddie,

1118
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:25,668
so I shall defend her."

1119
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:32,471
If they want John Surratt,

1120
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,209
then you should serve him up
on a platter.

1121
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:41,690
I... I don't mean, uh, physically.
I mean in spirit.

1122
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,158
You have to prove to the Commission

1123
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:47,185
that he is responsible, not her.

1124
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:50,756
She's not gonna like that.

1125
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,333
Mr. Lloyd, you are a tenant
of Mary Surratt, are you not?

1126
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,428
Yes, sir.

1127
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,939
I run a tavern some 10 miles
from the city

1128
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,601
on a property she owns.

1129
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:04,875
And on the afternoon
that President Lincoln was assassinated,

1130
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,212
did Mary Surratt pay you a visit?

1131
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:11,345
Yes, sir, in the company
of Louis Weichmann.

1132
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,658
And she brought you a package,
did she not?

1133
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,126
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.

1134
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,026
Small package
wrapped in newspaper.

1135
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:27,869
Did she tell you where
the package came from?

1136
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,303
Said it came from
John Wilkes Booth.

1137
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,006
John Wilkes Booth!

1138
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:36,876
And what exactly did she give you?

1139
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,345
Objection.

1140
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,746
There's no way the defendant
could have known what was inside.

1141
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,512
He just testified the package
was wrapped.

1142
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,113
Overruled.

1143
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,814
Witness will answer the question.

1144
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,915
Mr. Lloyd, what was inside the package?

1145
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,291
Field glasses, sir.

1146
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,522
Field glasses?

1147
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:54,859
Field glasses like these?

1148
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,057
Exactly.

1149
01:08:56,098 --> 01:09:00,467
With the initials "J.W.B."
inscribed on them.

1150
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,535
Did she give you any instructions?

1151
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:07,041
Sir?

1152
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,135
Instructions, Mr. Lloyd?

1153
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,669
Instructions which may affect this trial?

1154
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:15,810
Oh. Yes, sir.

1155
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,443
Ahem. She told me,

1156
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,649
"Lloyd, get those
shootin' irons ready.

1157
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:24,216
There will be parties here tonight
who will call for them."

1158
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,249
You liar!

1159
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,283
Order!

1160
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,420
- He's a liar!
- Order!

1161
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:28,521
- It's a lie.
- Order!

1162
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,631
Control yourself, madam.

1163
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,994
Such outbursts will only
prejudice your case.

1164
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,302
Oh, Lord.

1165
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:43,078
I just don't see how I could possibly
further prejudice this case, sir.

1166
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:46,445
Counselor,
you will control your client.

1167
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,074
General.

1168
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,211
Shooting irons!

1169
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,419
Shooting irons.

1170
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,424
And to what was she referring?

1171
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,823
Army rifles, sir,

1172
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,920
hidden in the joist
above the dining room.

1173
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,430
And what else did she tell you?

1174
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,922
She said I was to get two bottles
of whiskey ready, too.

1175
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,071
And were these things called for,

1176
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,040
as per the defendant's instructions?

1177
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,064
Yes, sir.

1178
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:15,406
About midnight, sir,

1179
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,241
the night of the assassination,

1180
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,407
by two men on horses, one...

1181
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,777
I'd seen before.

1182
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,148
T'bther was a stranger to me.

1183
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:33,722
I brought the items, thinking these
were the parties Mrs. Surratt meant.

1184
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,303
Two of 'em rode off so fast,

1185
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:56,341
they could have outrun Creation
and give it two-mile a start.

1186
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:00,780
Your witness.

1187
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,425
I did not...

1188
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,693
Mr. Lloyd.

1189
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,766
Mr. Lloyd, you just testified

1190
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:19,240
that Louis Weichmann accompanied
the defendant that afternoon.

1191
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,537
Right.

1192
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,543
So then I can correctly assume

1193
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:26,207
that he would also testify
to having heard her instructions to you.

1194
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,772
No.

1195
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:31,175
She took me out by the woodpile
out of earshot.

1196
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,088
So you're saying that nobody
heard this conversation,

1197
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,489
just you and her.

1198
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,590
Way it happened, sir.

1199
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:40,419
Of course it is.

1200
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:42,293
Of course it is.

1201
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:47,996
When did you learn of President Lincoln's
assassination?

1202
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,338
Well, who can forget when they heard?

1203
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,001
The next morning,
a Captain Cottingham told me.

1204
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,608
He was searching for the assassins.

1205
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,511
No doubt, you were most upset.

1206
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,314
Indeed.

1207
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,417
I got myself right smart in liquor.

1208
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:09,891
Yes, you're... you're right smart
in liquor most days,

1209
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,085
- aren't you, Mr. Lloyd?
- Objection.

1210
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,720
In fact, I hear that you're
your own best customer.

1211
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:14,751
Objection.

1212
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,890
Sustained.

1213
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,400
This Captain Cottingham,

1214
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:24,600
did he ask you anything in reference
to the assassins?

1215
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,272
He asked if any parties
had passed through.

1216
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,471
Naturally I told him
about the two I knew.

1217
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,605
Actually, you did not.

1218
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:39,214
According to this witness report,

1219
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,552
you said nothing for two days.

1220
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:43,990
I was frightened is all.

1221
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,227
I feared the assassins
might come for me.

1222
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,730
Perhaps, though, you were afraid
that the authorities

1223
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:52,063
might consider you an accessory.

1224
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:56,629
Well, it was through the Surratts
that I got myself in such difficulty.

1225
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:57,900
The Surratts.

1226
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,807
Don't you mean John Surratt,
to be more precise?

1227
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,373
Wasn't it he who brought
the shooting irons

1228
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,778
to your tavern door
in the first place?

1229
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:06,803
Yeah.

1230
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,646
And he showed you
where to hide them?

1231
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,015
I didn't want to.

1232
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:13,283
So you're saying that he asked you,

1233
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,950
forced you to do so against your will.

1234
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:18,957
Yes.

1235
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,588
So he brought them to you,

1236
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:23,958
he showed you where to hide them,

1237
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,661
and he forced you to hide them
against your will?

1238
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,398
That's right. Yes, exactly.

1239
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,503
If John Surratt was capable

1240
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,839
of putting Mr. Lloyd,
Louis Weichmann

1241
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,435
and Lord knows
how many others at risk,

1242
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,412
who's to say he didn't do
the same to his mother?

1243
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,641
- Objection.
- Stop this!

1244
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,774
- Sir, it seems the...
- Stop it right now, Mr. Aiken.

1245
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,284
- It seems the only thing...
- Objection.

1246
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,445
- General, objection.
- that Mary Surratt might be guilty of

1247
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,854
- is having given birth to her son John.
- How dare you?

1248
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,451
Objection sustained.
That will be all, Mr. Aiken.

1249
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,125
Just to be clear, Mr. Lloyd,

1250
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,136
it was the defendant, Mary Surratt,

1251
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,365
who just hours before
the assassination

1252
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:04,838
brought you field glasses

1253
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,536
and instructed you to prepare rifles
and two bottles of whiskey?

1254
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,135
Yeah.

1255
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,205
Thank you.

1256
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,308
General Hunter,

1257
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:18,546
members of the Commission,

1258
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:22,455
the government rests its case
against Mary Surratt.

1259
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:25,688
That'll be all, Mr. Lloyd.
You may step down.

1260
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:31,063
What did they promise you
to say that, Mr. Lloyd?

1261
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,396
Counselor, I'm warning you.

1262
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,403
Bet a case of whiskey's all it took.

1263
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,837
You best hush up.
I'll put you in the ground, boy.

1264
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,068
Mr. Aiken, you will sit down, sir.

1265
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,541
You shut him up.

1266
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,067
Sit down, sir.

1267
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:51,951
Now...

1268
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:54,780
we will adjourn.

1269
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,515
When we resume,

1270
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,492
the defense may call its first witness.

1271
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,264
Left. Left.

1272
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,441
Excuse me, sirs.

1273
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:22,643
Uh, Captain Cottingham?

1274
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,307
Yes.

1275
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,980
Can I have a word with you, please?

1276
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:28,645
Sir.

1277
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,983
And did you interview John Lloyd,

1278
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:34,323
the man who runs the tavern
on Mrs. Surratt's property?

1279
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,853
Yes, right after the assassination.

1280
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:40,267
And did he tell you that Mrs. Surratt

1281
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,667
asked for rifles and whiskey?

1282
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:45,966
Yes. Lloyd said Mrs. Surratt asked him
to do all those things.

1283
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,640
Uh, excuse me?

1284
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,444
Did we not talk just yesterday?

1285
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:56,576
We did.

1286
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:58,245
And did you not say

1287
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:02,781
that Mrs. Surratt never asked for whiskey
or rifles of John Lloyd?

1288
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,117
I do not deny that.

1289
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:06,987
And now you're swearing,

1290
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,725
under oath,
that what you told me then was a lie.

1291
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:14,134
Yes. I lied to you 'bause I thought
you had no business to ask me.

1292
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,261
No business? I...

1293
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,565
You're my witness.

1294
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,135
Should I not expect the truth?

1295
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,743
I state here that I did lie to you,

1296
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:26,270
but under oath,
now I'm telling the truth.

1297
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,822
Mr. Holt, do you wish
to question the witness?

1298
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:37,950
Uh, no. I believe what we've heard
is more than sufficient.

1299
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:41,360
Captain, you may step down.

1300
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,024
As you know, tonight marks

1301
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:47,263
Washington's celebration
honoring our troops,

1302
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,633
so we will adjourn.

1303
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,970
It's not enough, is it, Mr. Holt?

1304
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:00,981
It's not enough that you, uh...

1305
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:04,144
you set the rules.
You... You pick the judges.

1306
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,347
Now you have to turn
my witness as well.

1307
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,582
Counselor, control yourself.

1308
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,386
Control the prosecution.

1309
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:10,413
Mr. Aiken.

1310
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,724
Every witness I wish to call has either
been turned by jail or the threat of it.

1311
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:14,751
That's enough!

1312
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,629
There is no limit to how far
the prosecution is willing to go!

1313
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,464
Stand down, counselor,
or I will hold you in contempt.

1314
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:26,433
You had better comport yourself
in a more appropriate manner,

1315
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,467
or you will find yourself
incarcerated with the others.

1316
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,945
Good evening.

1317
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,948
Good evening, Douglas.

1318
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,051
- Ma'am.
- Good evening.

1319
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:49,063
Mr. Aiken, may I have
a word with you?

1320
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,792
Of course.
Would you excuse me?

1321
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,998
MAN: His first day on the job.

1322
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,313
I'm sorry, Mr. Aiken.

1323
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,821
It's all right, Douglas.
It's not your fault.

1324
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,322
Frederick!

1325
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:18,884
Uh, Nick, would you escort Sarah
upstairs for me, please?

1326
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,361
Sure, but, uh...

1327
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,387
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

1328
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:25,289
Come on, Sarah.

1329
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:28,393
Even with one good leg,
I can still outdance him.

1330
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:29,461
Another night, Nick.

1331
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,675
Sarah.

1332
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,538
Sarah, where are you going?

1333
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,713
"Conduct unbecoming."

1334
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,240
I'm sorry about the party.

1335
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:44,513
You think I care about the party?

1336
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,350
Please. Everything will be all right.
I promise you.

1337
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,787
You are just like that woman,

1338
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:51,691
ready to go to the gallows
for the most pointless cause.

1339
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,854
People do get left behind
when you do that.

1340
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,795
I can't ignore what's going on
in that courtroom.

1341
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:58,129
But you can ignore me, us?

1342
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,929
I didn't say that.
Please, I have to do this.

1343
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:00,957
Do you?

1344
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,665
I find your devotion to this frightening.

1345
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:07,903
I waited such a long time for you.

1346
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,001
I'm so sorry.

1347
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:11,103
I know. But I'm back now.

1348
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,046
No, you're not.

1349
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,070
I am. I... ple...

1350
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,743
Sarah, please, will you just...

1351
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,082
We have to...
we have to talk about this.

1352
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,884
Fred, I love you. I...

1353
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,789
I wish I could do this.
I just... I can't.

1354
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,690
I just can't.

1355
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,621
Wait. Let me see you home at least.

1356
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:28,788
Please wait.

1357
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:39,703
Uh, Mr. Secretary.

1358
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,704
I have to speak with you.

1359
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:44,507
Mr. Aiken, perhaps this isn't
the best time.

1360
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:47,014
What is happening to Mary Surratt
is an abomination.

1361
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,072
Stand down, Captain.

1362
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,310
It's all right.

1363
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:51,319
Would you escort Mrs. Stanton in?

1364
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:52,980
I'll just be a moment.

1365
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,045
Yes, sir.

1366
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,947
Young man...

1367
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,751
always indebted to you
for your courage in the field,

1368
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,387
but you must learn to tread lightly.

1369
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,418
Tread lightly?

1370
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,056
I will not tread lightly.

1371
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,930
You have predetermined her fate.

1372
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,458
Mary Surratt's fate rests entirely
with the Commission.

1373
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,437
My concern is preserving our Union.

1374
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,839
Why did I fight for the Union
if my rights aren't assured?

1375
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,899
You tell me.

1376
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:17,275
Fine words for rallying the troops,
not for running a nation.

1377
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,371
They assassinated our president,

1378
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:21,644
and someone must be
held accountable.

1379
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:23,514
The people want that.

1380
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,112
It's John Surratt you want.
You don't even want Mary.

1381
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,212
I'll settle for either one.

1382
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:29,519
If you'll excuse me,
my wife is waiting.

1383
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:26,077
Mr. Aiken.

1384
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:27,674
May I come in?

1385
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,047
- It's late.
- I know.

1386
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,189
I need you to testify.

1387
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:42,690
Very well.

1388
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,291
I'll tell them my mother's innocent.

1389
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,627
I need you to tell them
that your brother is not.

1390
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,104
I won't do it.

1391
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,972
You know what'll happen
to her if you don't?

1392
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:58,611
Anna...

1393
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:02,008
Your brother does not need
to be saved right now.

1394
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:03,743
Your mother does.

1395
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,014
Mr. Aiken,

1396
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:13,220
are there any other
witnesses you wish to call?

1397
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,196
Uh, yes.

1398
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:19,166
The... The defense

1399
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,829
would like to call Miss Anna Surratt.

1400
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:30,802
General Hunter, what is...

1401
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,620
Place your right hand on this Bible.

1402
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:40,643
Where's my mother?

1403
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:42,054
Anna, she's just right here,

1404
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,887
behind these men.

1405
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:45,859
Why won't they let me see her?

1406
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:47,156
I don't know.

1407
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:50,096
Please, Miss Surratt.

1408
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,437
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

1409
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,405
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

1410
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:02,433
Miss Anna.

1411
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:05,873
I do.

1412
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,409
It'll be all right.

1413
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:17,119
Miss Surratt, can you tell us

1414
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:20,594
when your brother first became acquainted
with John Wilkes Booth?

1415
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:29,631
Miss Surratt, you will
answer the question.

1416
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:35,202
I believe my brother
met him January last.

1417
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,734
Three months before
the assassination.

1418
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:41,545
He must have been mighty pleased
to have befriended such a famous actor.

1419
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,941
You'll have to ask him.

1420
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:45,748
Well, I'm sure we'd all like to ask him.

1421
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:51,685
Your brother proudly called himself
a friend of Booth's, did he not?

1422
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:52,556
Mr. Aiken, what are you doing?

1423
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:53,583
Mother!

1424
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:55,027
Miss Surratt.
Miss Surratt, please.

1425
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:57,822
Miss Surratt.

1426
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:00,823
I never...

1427
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,703
asked what my brother's
relationship was to Booth.

1428
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,037
It was at John's invitation

1429
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,236
that he first came to your home,
was it not?

1430
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,404
Yes.

1431
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:20,154
Does this picture of Booth
belong to you?

1432
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:27,050
I found it in a gallery one day,
and I bought it.

1433
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:32,530
Your brother must have been pleased
that you held his friend in such high regard.

1434
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,994
- No.
- No?

1435
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,600
No. He told me to tear it up
and throw it away.

1436
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:39,703
Why?

1437
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:41,867
Why did your brother
tell you to destroy

1438
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,537
a photograph of his friend, Booth?

1439
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:45,306
No, Mr. Aiken!

1440
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:46,643
- Please.
- I beg of you.

1441
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:47,978
- Please.
- Order!

1442
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:49,005
Miss Surratt, please.

1443
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:50,976
Answer my question.

1444
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,349
I suppose he was trying to protect us.

1445
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:58,985
He was trying to protect
you and your mother?

1446
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:00,994
Yes.

1447
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,589
Why would he need
to protect his family?

1448
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,037
Anna, you have to choose.

1449
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:16,937
I suppose...

1450
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,509
he and Booth
were planning something.

1451
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,414
He was planning something.

1452
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:26,682
Did you know what?

1453
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,556
Of course not.

1454
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,388
When did you last see your brother?

1455
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,827
He left at the beginning of April.

1456
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,763
Days before the assassination.

1457
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:39,266
Did he tell you where he was going
or what he might be planning?

1458
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,131
He only said he had to leave.

1459
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,199
And did you or your mother
try to stop him?

1460
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:46,938
Yes.

1461
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:52,011
- But we couldn't.
- How could you? He was angry.

1462
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:53,673
He was frustrated with the war.

1463
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:54,773
He hated the Union.

1464
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,148
He would have done
anything in his power,

1465
01:25:57,185 --> 01:26:00,348
even risk his own family
to aid Booth in his cause.

1466
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:04,290
But, Miss Surratt, did your mother conspire
with John Wilkes Booth?

1467
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,190
Absolutely not.

1468
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,287
Thank you.

1469
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:11,992
There are no more questions.

1470
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,169
General Hunter,
the government understands

1471
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:19,173
why Miss Surratt would be moved

1472
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:22,938
to the most extraordinary lengths
to conceal her mother's guilt,

1473
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:26,413
including incriminating
her own brother.

1474
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,677
My mother is innocent.

1475
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:31,082
Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.

1476
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:31,949
The government no longer
deems it necessary to hold you.

1477
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:34,321
You are free to leave.

1478
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:35,879
I just want to see my mother.

1479
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:39,325
Please. I'm sorry, mother.

1480
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,918
I'm sorry.

1481
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:44,159
Please.
Please, let me see her.

1482
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,996
Sir, the defense would push
for the Commission

1483
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,007
to show some compassion
and allow a mother

1484
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,033
to see her daughter
for a brief moment only.

1485
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,115
We will reconvene in the morning.

1486
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,976
Frederick, it's me.

1487
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:40,010
Anna.

1488
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,715
What are you doing here?

1489
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:48,656
You never asked why
I had Booth's photo.

1490
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:54,335
Tear that up and throw it away.

1491
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:57,867
That man is gonna get us all
in trouble, if not worse.

1492
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,173
I should have thrown it away,

1493
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,944
but I didn't.

1494
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:21,320
So you were infatuated with Booth.

1495
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,488
I swear I didn't know
what he was capable of.

1496
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,433
I believe you.
But your brother did.

1497
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:33,400
Can you save my mother without him?

1498
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,432
Can you, Frederick?

1499
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:39,871
Probably not.

1500
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,182
Father Walter!

1501
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:51,590
Father?

1502
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:57,061
Will you excuse us for a minute?

1503
01:28:58,299 --> 01:28:59,288
Counselor.

1504
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,894
I need to see John Surratt right away.

1505
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:05,429
Anna Surratt sent me.

1506
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:09,136
Well, as I told Miss Surratt,
I can only pass along a message.

1507
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:10,770
Where is he?

1508
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,245
I don't know.

1509
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,117
Only that some in the church have chosen
to provide him sanctuary.

1510
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,415
You don't seem troubled by their choice.

1511
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:22,651
You prefer he be crucified by this mob?

1512
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,783
John is hardly the Prince of Peace.

1513
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,623
He's wanted for murder and treason.

1514
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,562
Harboring him is not only immoral,
Father, it's illegal.

1515
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:33,693
Our laws are written here, counselor,
our allegiance to God.

1516
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:34,463
You forgive me, Father,

1517
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:36,902
but that's a bunch
of cock and bull.

1518
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:39,668
Bible bears as many interpretations
as anything else.

1519
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,370
Is there a message
you wish me to pass along?

1520
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,844
My case summary is tomorrow,

1521
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,005
so you tell John Surratt

1522
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,344
that unless he surrenders himself,

1523
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,909
his mother will most likely be
punished for his crimes.

1524
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,123
Mr. Aiken.

1525
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:12,737
For the lawyer as well as the soldier,

1526
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:16,266
there is an equally imperative command.

1527
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:20,906
That duty is to shelter from injustice
the innocent,

1528
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,149
to protect the weak from oppression

1529
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:26,210
and, when necessity demands,

1530
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,884
to rally to the defense
of those being wronged.

1531
01:30:33,294 --> 01:30:37,560
After the most thorough investigation
in our nation's history,

1532
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:40,431
the government's entire case
against Mary Surratt

1533
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:41,457
rests on three acts...

1534
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,200
one,
her acquaintance with Booth,

1535
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,832
two,
her alleged instructions to Lloyd,

1536
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:50,241
and, three,
her nonrecognition of Payne.

1537
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:54,510
It is these three acts
that constitute the sum total

1538
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:59,851
of Mary Surratt's part in this traitorous
and murderous conspiracy.

1539
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:03,485
By themselves,
they constitute no crime.

1540
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:06,416
Any one of you or I
might have done the same,

1541
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:10,295
but the government insists
she did them with evil intent,

1542
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:12,963
largely based on the testimony of two men,

1543
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,127
John Lloyd
and Louis Weichmann.

1544
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:20,098
Yet, at best, the actions of these men
undermine their credibility,

1545
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:23,304
and, at worst,
they have done the unspeakable...

1546
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:25,312
they have gained their freedom

1547
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:28,838
by falsely accusing another
of their crime.

1548
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:33,750
There can be no doubt as
to the principal and real reason

1549
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:35,722
that Mary Surratt is here today.

1550
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:37,986
It's because of her son, John Surratt.

1551
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:41,617
He invited Booth into her home.
She did not.

1552
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:45,063
And he hid rifles and ammunition
in Lloyd's Tavern.

1553
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,566
She did not.

1554
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,728
If John Surratt was part
of this conspiracy,

1555
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,466
I pray to God that he receives
every punishment known to man,

1556
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,739
but if his mother can be convicted
on such insufficient evidence,

1557
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:59,473
I tell you none of you are safe.

1558
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:03,810
Members of the Commission,

1559
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:07,886
do not permit this injustice
to Mary Surratt

1560
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:11,722
by sacrificing our sacred rights
out of revenge.

1561
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:16,159
Too many of us have laid down
our lives to preserve them.

1562
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:28,708
Gentlemen.

1563
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:32,745
Gentlemen.

1564
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:40,179
One bullet may have killed
our beloved president.

1565
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:45,022
One bullet, but not one man.

1566
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:55,566
Sit with me.

1567
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:06,971
Is there any word?

1568
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:11,314
No. They're still deliberating.

1569
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:13,946
I mean about my son.

1570
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:18,415
I held him too close.

1571
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,960
I didn't want John turning out
like his father,

1572
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,227
so I kept him near.

1573
01:33:29,203 --> 01:33:33,367
And when the war broke out,
he wanted to enlist,

1574
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:35,766
but I wouldn't let him.

1575
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:42,314
My son just needed to break free...

1576
01:33:44,418 --> 01:33:45,442
be his own man.

1577
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:50,584
And this is the way he did it.

1578
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:58,830
All those in favor?

1579
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:01,561
Aye.

1580
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,698
Well, then, we are all agreed

1581
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:09,505
on the penalty of death
for the prisoners

1582
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:12,307
Herold, Atzerodt and Payne.

1583
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:16,715
What about the woman?

1584
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:24,086
Regarding Mary Surratt,

1585
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:27,116
all those in favor, gentlemen?

1586
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:45,234
No.

1587
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:48,104
Damn it!

1588
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:49,377
No.

1589
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:54,244
No, she must be punished
to the full extent.

1590
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,688
I want these people
buried and forgotten.

1591
01:34:56,724 --> 01:35:01,058
The majority prefer
a more merciful sentence,

1592
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:06,356
life in prison
on account of her age, gender.

1593
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:08,027
I give Mr. Aiken credit.

1594
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:10,697
He knew just how
to use the daughter.

1595
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:11,864
It seems so.

1596
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:15,774
You made my sentiments known
to the Commission?

1597
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:18,335
Their minds are made.

1598
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:24,148
Then let us change them.

1599
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:39,594
"After mature consideration
of the evidence,

1600
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:43,165
"Commission finds you,

1610

01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:30,250
Mary Surratt to meet her doom!

1614
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:33,310
Four assassins die tomorrow at noon!

1615
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,126
Mr. Surratt.

1616
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,191
Here, sir.

1617
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,621
There must be something we can do.

1618
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:11,886
You have three options:

1619
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:14,394
Petition the president
for a stay of execution...

1620
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:15,952
but, uh, he won't do that,

1621
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:17,827
because if he did,
people would think

1622
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:19,423
he was part of the conspiracy.

1623
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:22,902
Uh, two, apply for
a writ of habeas corpus

1624
01:37:22,937 --> 01:37:24,427
to retry her in a civilian court,

1625
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:26,405
but no judge would oppose Stanton

1626
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,738
or the might of the War Department.

1627
01:37:28,776 --> 01:37:32,439
Uh, and, three, John Surratt

1628
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:35,243
shows himself before noon tomorrow.

1629
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:37,079
Are you going somewhere?

1630
01:37:37,117 --> 01:37:39,312
I have business in Baltimore.

1631
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:40,377
What?

1632
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:42,355
You... You can't leave now!

1633
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:45,351
It's over.

1634
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:51,894
Freddie, she's not your mother.

1635
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:55,697
If John Surratt won't
give himself up for her,

1636
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:57,437
then why should you?

1637
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,135
Freddie!

1638
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:09,081
Frederick Sebastian Aiken,
we know you're in there!

1639
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:11,641
Open the door now. Come on.

1640
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:13,983
Fred... ah, there he is.

1641
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:17,286
Well, if it isn't
the reclusive Master Aiken.

1642
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,456
We thought you could use this.

1643
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,593
Hamilton, how well
do you know Judge Olin?

1644
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:24,686
What are you doing?

1645
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,563
You think he'll give me
a writ of habeas corpus?

1646
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,965
You can't pursue a writ.

1647
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:29,526
They won't allow me
to appeal this verdict,

1648
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,094
so I'm gonna appeal for a new trial.

1649
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:32,662
If you do this,
you will humiliate Stanton,

1650
01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:34,139
and he will destroy you.

1651
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:35,641
The hell with Stanton.

1652
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:38,543
Why do you... Why do you insist
on standing by her?

1653
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,342
Hey. Hey, it makes no sense.

1654
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:43,012
What they're doing to her is wrong.

1655
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,610
If John Wilkes Booth himself
was tried in the same manner,

1656
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:47,985
it would still be wrong.

1657
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:52,516
Hamilton, she's to hang
in less than 12 hours.

1658
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:55,218
Judge Olin's out of town.

1659
01:38:55,262 --> 01:38:56,889
He would have been my first choice.

1660
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:58,057
What about Wylie?

1661
01:38:58,098 --> 01:38:59,497
Maybe Wylie.

1662
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:02,434
He's, uh- -he's always been known
as a Free Thinker.

1663
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:05,563
Yes. He's been around for ages,
but he was the closest to Lincoln.

1664
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:06,504
Then what about Carter?

1665
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:09,907
Not a chance. He was with Stanton
on the night of the assassination.

1666
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,878
Besides, they have dinner
together once a week.

1667
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:14,176
Then you're saying that Wylie
is my best option.

1668
01:39:14,214 --> 01:39:16,739
No. Your best option is
to stop this nonsense

1669
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:18,479
and help us empty this bottle.

1670
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:20,180
Better listen to the man.

1671
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,028
Judge Wylie?

1672
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:41,196
I, uh... I need to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus.

1673
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,703
At this hour of the night?

1674
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,143
I'm sorry, sir. It can't wait.

1675
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:47,511
Interrupting an old man's sleep?

1676
01:39:47,548 --> 01:39:50,676
I'd say you're getting off
on the wrong foot, son.

1677
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:51,980
It's for Mary Surratt.

1678
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:06,423
A new trial...

1679
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:11,198
in a civil court
by a jury of her peers.

1680
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:12,728
Is that what you want, Mr. Aiken?

1681
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:14,240
Yes, please, Your Honor.

1682
01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:18,176
So we can relive our president's
assassination all over again.

1683
01:40:18,212 --> 01:40:19,144
That's not my intention.

1684
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:20,806
Then to what intent?

1685
01:40:21,949 --> 01:40:24,679
Might this not result
in exactly the same thing?

1686
01:40:24,718 --> 01:40:28,745
Perhaps, but results should not be
our only measure ofjustice.

1687
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:31,257
Are you going
to lecture me on justice?

1688
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:32,280
Sorry, sir.

1689
01:40:32,326 --> 01:40:36,888
You realize that I was personally
appointed by President Lincoln.

1690
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,919
Yes.

1691
01:40:37,965 --> 01:40:40,297
And yet you still come to me.

1692
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:43,528
Forgive me, Your Honor,

1693
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:48,166
but are we not obligated
to follow the law at all times,

1694
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:49,800
regardless of our emotions?

1695
01:40:49,843 --> 01:40:51,868
And is this not driven by emotions?

1696
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:53,004
Isn't that what this is all about?

1697
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,742
It's about preventing injustice.

1698
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,018
Now, I know that the people
are still angry.

1699
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,644
Yes, they are, and so am I.

1700
01:40:59,686 --> 01:41:01,483
But I hope,
I trust that President Lincoln

1701
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:06,619
appointed you because you hold
the Constitution sacred.

1702
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:09,857
Whether you believe Mary Surratt
is guilty or innocent,

1703
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,387
the Constitution was intended...

1704
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:13,024
And now you're gonna
lecture me on the Constitution.

1705
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:16,833
...to protect the rights of all citizens
at all times in peace or war.

1706
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:18,462
And in a matter of hours,

1707
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:21,997
it will have failed to protect her
unless you sign that writ.

1708
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:25,809
You believe she's innocent?

1709
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:28,542
I don't know.

1710
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:32,450
But if we don't get a proper trial,
we never will.

1711
01:41:35,322 --> 01:41:36,789
You can't go in there! Wait!

1712
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:42,992
I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I tried to stop him.

1713
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,160
It's all right.

1714
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:58,104
Good morning, Joseph.

1715
01:41:58,145 --> 01:41:59,203
Good morning.

1716
01:41:59,246 --> 01:42:03,615
It appears that Mr. Aiken has procured
a writ signed by Judge Wylie.

1717
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:04,844
Good day.

1718
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:07,683
Before you go, Captain,

1719
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:09,513
tell me...

1720
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:13,860
when you first learned
that our secretary of State

1721
01:42:13,894 --> 01:42:15,384
had been butchered
to within an inch of his life

1722
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:18,455
and that they put a bullet in the back
of our president's head,

1723
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:20,160
when this city was in chaos,

1724
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,829
did you not wish to see order restored
and justice served,

1725
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:28,274
or were you just concerned
with the rights of the assassins?

1726
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:31,209
It's notjustice you're after.
It's revenge.

1727
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:35,842
I would never go to such lengths
out of vengeance,

1728
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:40,980
but to ensure the survival of this nation,
I would do anything.

1729
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:46,957
Mary Surratt was a party
to the most grievous crime in our history.

1730
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:52,728
Necessity demands that she be given
a swift, sure and harsh sentence.

1731
01:42:52,766 --> 01:42:57,032
I, too, hold sacred
our rights, counselor,

1732
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:02,372
but they count not at all
if our nation ceases to exist.

1733
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:05,271
Please see to it that Mary Surratt

1734
01:43:05,312 --> 01:43:08,611
is delivered to Judge Wylie's courtroom
no later than noon...

1735
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:09,704
sir.

1736
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,891
Let's go. Come on. Stay there.

1737
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,099
You will have to stand trial again,

1738
01:43:35,142 --> 01:43:37,872
but it will be a civilian trial.

1739
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,173
And a civilian trial has no generals.

1740
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:40,544
That's correct. No generals.

1741
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:43,982
Bless you, son.

1742
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:45,507
Bless you.

1743
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:51,222
Oh, Mama.

1744
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:52,282
Anna.

1745
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,359
Should only be three.

1746
01:44:04,871 --> 01:44:05,997
It's time, ma'am.

1747
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:08,503
What are you doing?

1748
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:10,237
We need to prepare her
with the others.

1749
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:13,804
No. No, she is to be transferred
to Judge Wylie's court.

1750
01:44:13,847 --> 01:44:16,145
I advise sedating the young lady.

1751
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:17,616
You'll do no such thing.

1752
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:21,553
Anna. I have procured a writ
that says she is to get a new trial.

1753
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:26,183
Presidentjust suspended your writ.

1754
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:33,564
I'm sorry.

1755
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,363
She's to hang with the others.

1756
01:44:35,402 --> 01:44:36,391
No.

1757
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,529
No. Frederick, do something.

1758
01:44:40,207 --> 01:44:42,539
I...

1759
01:44:42,576 --> 01:44:44,703
I'm so sorry.

1760
01:44:44,745 --> 01:44:46,212
Oh, no.

1761
01:44:46,246 --> 01:44:47,713
No. No, no, no, no.

1762
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:49,045
No, Mama. No.
No, Mama. No.

1763
01:44:49,082 --> 01:44:50,549
I'll always be with you.

1764
01:44:50,584 --> 01:44:53,678
No! No!
Oh, Mama, no!

1765
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,984
I love you, Anna.
I love you.

1766
01:44:56,023 --> 01:44:57,388
No!

1767
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,517
Oh, God, no!

1768
01:45:01,028 --> 01:45:03,019
Mama!

1769
01:45:23,016 --> 01:45:26,508
<i>Inter arma, silent leges</i>.

1770
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:31,452
"In times of war,
the law falls silent."

1771
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:33,683
It shouldn't.

1772
01:45:38,131 --> 01:45:42,568
Word is the last Confederate general
surrendered to Union troops.

1773
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:43,899
Peace.

1774
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:45,404
Peace at last.

1775
01:47:57,871 --> 01:47:59,702
I am hereby commanded

1776
01:47:59,739 --> 01:48:01,536
to cause David E. Herold,

1777
01:48:01,575 --> 01:48:03,338
G. A. Atzerodt,

1778
01:48:03,376 --> 01:48:05,071
Lewis Payne

1779
01:48:05,111 --> 01:48:08,046
and Mary E. Surratt

1780
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:10,476
to be executed

1781
01:48:10,517 --> 01:48:13,816
in accordance with the order of the president
of the United States,

1782
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,151
Andrew Johnson.

1783
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:27,095
The Almighty God bless you.

1784
01:49:08,675 --> 01:49:10,336
Stand your prisoners up.

1785
01:49:13,747 --> 01:49:14,975
Step them to the noose.

1786
01:50:59,786 --> 01:51:00,775
Okay, sir.
I'll show you where he's at...

1787
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,185
No, I know the way.

1788
01:51:23,977 --> 01:51:25,672
Mr. Aiken.

1789
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:29,110
I didn't think you'd come.

1790
01:51:29,149 --> 01:51:31,640
I don't know what help
I can be to you.

1791
01:51:32,585 --> 01:51:34,075
I've left the law.

1792
01:51:34,888 --> 01:51:35,946
I just wanted to thank you

1793
01:51:35,989 --> 01:51:38,480
for the kindness
that you showed my mother.

1794
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,656
Believe me, Mr. Aiken,

1795
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:43,686
I never thought they'd kill her.

1796
01:51:54,841 --> 01:51:57,435
Father Walter asked
that I give you these.

1797
01:51:58,611 --> 01:52:00,340
They were your mother's.

1798
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:05,976
I hope they can be
of some comfort to you.

1799
01:52:07,954 --> 01:52:09,387
They belong to you.

1800
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,890
You were more of a son to her
than I ever was.

1801
01:52:24,471 --> 01:52:25,529
Thank you.
