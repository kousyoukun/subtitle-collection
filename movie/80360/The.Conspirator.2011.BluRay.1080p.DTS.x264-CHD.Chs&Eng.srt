5
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,090
共  犯

6
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,090
天国之门前站着两个人
Two men standing at the Pearly Gates.

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,060
其中一个问另一个  "你怎么死的"
The first man says, "How'd you die?"

8
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,140
另一个回答  "我是冻死的
Second says, "I froze to death.

9
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,310
你呢"
How 'bout you?"

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,400
另一个人说道
And the, uh, second man says,

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,820
"我怀疑...老婆出轨
"Well, I thought my... my wife was being unfaithful to me,

12
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,570
所以我跑回家"  撑住
so I ran all the way home." Come on.

13
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,200
"冲进卧室"
"And burst into the bedroom."

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
屋里空空荡荡
There's nothin' here.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
-"她就..."  -到那边看看
- "She just..." - Look over there.

16
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,330
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,250
要确定幸存的人...
Make sure there's men on...

18
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,830
这边
Here!

19
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,330
我们在这儿
We're here!

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,460
先救他
You take him first.

21
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,760
可是  上尉  他就快...
But, captain, he's as good as...

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,130
这是命令
That's an order.

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,340
中士
Sergeant.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,010
小心  仔细点  下士
Hey, watch it. Careful. Corporal!

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,390
小心他的腿
Watch his leg.

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,890
两年后

27
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,470
1865年4月14日

28
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,430
为胜利干杯
Victory!

29
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,020
胜利言之尚早  你们觉得呢
Getting a little ahead of ourselves, don't you think?

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,190
威尔  李向格兰特投降了  值得干一杯
Will, Lee surrendered to Grant, so have a drink.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
弗雷迪  看见他了吗
Freddie, have you seen him yet?

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
还有大批的叛军逍遥法外
A dozen rebel armies still in the field.

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,650
和平还远着呢
I'd say peace is far from in hand.

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,570
汉密尔顿  你就爱煽风点火
Hamilton, you could put frost on a fire.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,670
我没看见  不过一半内阁成员都来了
No, I haven't, but half his cabinet's here.

36
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,700
内政部的...
There's Interior...

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,700
和邮政局长
and Postmaster.

38
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,210
财政局的
Treasury.

39
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,540
海军部长
Secretary of Navy.

40
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,250
陆军部长哪去了
Where's War?

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,750
在那呢
Ooh, there he is.

42
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,010
天哪  能认识他要我干什么都行
God, what I would give to meet him.

43
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,720
怎么了  等等  你要去哪
What? Wait. Where are you going?

44
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,840
你还想不想认识他了
You coming or not?

45
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,390
你是要...你疯了吗
Are you... Are you mad?

46
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,640
没人引荐怎么接近埃德温・斯坦顿
You can't approach Edwin Stanton without an introduction.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,930
真的吗
Really?

48
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,730
弗雷德里克・艾金
Frederick Aiken.

49
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,270
我都去上帝那兜一圈子才找到你
I've been to Creation and back lookin' for you.

50
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,440
参议员  贝克  汉密尔顿
Senator. Uh, Baker, Hamilton,

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,860
请允许我介绍这位出众的马里兰州参议员
allow me to introduce the distinguished senator from Maryland,

52
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,200
-勒韦迪・约翰逊先生  -见到你很荣幸  参议员
- Mr. Reverdy Johnson. - Great honor, senator.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,450
先生们  你们为国争光
Gentlemen, you've done this nation proud.

54
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,780
谢谢夸奖  长官
Thank you, sir.

55
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,160
女士们  女士们
Ladies. Ladies,

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,000
允许我介绍这两位真正的战斗英雄
may I present two genuine war heroes.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,250
你们相互认识认识吧
Now you all get acquainted

58
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,670
而我要把这位律师介绍给我的一些
while I introduce the counselor to some of my,

59
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,380
受人尊敬的同僚们
uh, esteemed associates.

60
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
-女士们  -你好
- Ladies. - Hello.

61
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,630
人来的不少
It's, uh, quite a turnout.

62
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,630
-你好  -很荣幸认识这位可爱的...
- Hello. - It's an honor to meet the lovely...

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,380
人人对于胜利趋之若鹜  弗雷迪
Victory is like shit to flies, Freddie.

64
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,470
你怎么来了  埃德  真是个惊喜
Why, Ed, what a delightful surprise.

65
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,300
活着就有惊喜  勒韦迪
Life's full of them, Reverdy.

66
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,970
这位是陆军部长  埃德温・斯坦顿先生
This is our War secretary, Mr. Edwin Stanton.

67
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,060
见到您真是...太荣幸了  长官
Yeah. It's a... it's a very great pleasure, sir.

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,650
艾金腹部中了两枪
Mr. Aiken had two horses shot from under him

69
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,110
依然坚持战斗
and never quit the field.

70
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,650
陆军部正需像你一样的忠诚之士
Could use a loyal man like you over at the War Department,

71
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,150
上尉
Captain.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,150
长官
Sir.

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,070
从前线回来后  上尉成了一名律师
Captain's back to bein' a lawyer.

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,970
该整理下这个国家了  埃德
Time to heal the nation, Ed,

75
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,160
不能再生战事了
not wage more war.

76
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,750
全心全意一如既往  参议员
Pleasure as always, Senator.

77
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,290
-上尉  -长官
- Captain. - Sir.

78
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,170
很抱歉你今晚见不到总统了
I'm sorry you won't be able to meet the president this evening.

79
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,380
他不会出席了吗
Will he not be attending?

80
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,670
比起一屋子军人的房子
It seems Mrs. Lincoln prefers an evening of theater

81
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,130
林肯夫人好像更愿意去剧院
to a room full of soldiers.

82
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,510
什么都行  我什么都能演
Anything. I can play anything.

83
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,550
比如可怜的小瞎子吗
Poor Blind Boy?

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,930
那我还真不知道  什么都行...
I don't know that one. Uh, anything...

85
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,970
谢谢你  尼古拉斯
Oh, thank you, Nicholas.

86
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,640
萨拉...天哪  你太美了
Sarah... oh, my God. You look beautiful.

87
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,190
萨拉  见到你很高兴
Sarah, glad to see you.

88
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,360
弗雷德没说你今晚也会来
Fred didn't mention you'd be joining us this evening.

89
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,480
还真像弗雷德会做的事
That sounds like Fred.

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,730
什么像弗雷德会做的事
What sounds like Fred?

91
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,360
不是什么值得一提的事
Nothing you need to worry about.

92
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,200
你现在喝了多少瓶了  尼克
How many bottles is that now, Nick?

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,950
不是什么值得一提的数目  弗雷德
Uh, nothing you need to worry about, Fred.

94
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,410
去散散步吗
Shall we take a stroll?

95
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,660
你们回来了  太好了
It's good to have you boys back.

96
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,250
能回来真是太好了
It's good to be back.

97
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,210
能回来真是太棒了
It's very good to be back.

98
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,600
没错
Oh, quite right.

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,980
有些姑娘和她们的母亲会看...
Some gals and their mothers would look...

100
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,200
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

101
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,250
什么事  参议员
Yes, Senator?

102
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,610
很抱歉打扰您  先生
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,

103
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,330
但我需要您对此的授权
but I need your authorization on this.

104
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,500
非要赶现在吗  我有许多客人
Is it really necessary right now? I have so many guests.

105
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,710
恐怕这事更紧要些
I'm afraid it's relatively urgent.

106
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,170
你的眼睛得避开阳光
You have to keep the sun out of your eyes,

107
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,260
直视目标  用力扣动扳机
look straight, pull strong,

108
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,260
计算好距离
calculate the distance,

109
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,510
就能枪枪命中
and you'll hit the mark every time.

110
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,860
-怎么了  -不清楚
- What? - Not sure.

111
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,940
先生
Sir?

112
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,110
是的  我有个给苏厄德部长的包裹
Yes, I have a package for Secretary Seward.

113
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,450
我们是老朋友了  特伦查德先生
We are old friends, Mr. Trenchard,

114
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,490
而且你不用害怕我们
and you needn't be afraid of us.

115
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,950
我才不怕你
I ain't afraid of you,

116
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,290
你们两个加在一起也不怕
both of you together.

117
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,680
再来一杯吗
Want another?

118
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,310
先生
Sir?

119
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,530
斯坦顿部长是个聪明人
Secretary Stanton is a smart man.

120
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,280
有你是陆军部的福气
The War Department would be lucky to have you.

121
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,000
见到他确实很荣幸  可是...
It was an honor to meet the man, but...

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,750
我想远离战事
I'm eager to put the war behind me.

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,750
你穿军服真的很帅
You do look awfully handsome in your uniform.

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,050
估计我又要去习惯你
I suppose I'm going to have to get used to you

125
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,260
身着平头百姓的衣服了
in civilian clothing again.

126
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,310
那你确实有想我吧
So you did miss me?

127
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,350
偶尔吧
On occasion.

128
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,610
我现在没什么财产
Now I've no fortune,

129
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,950
但是我的感情充斥着我
but I am filled over with affection

130
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,620
令我蓄势待发要扑向你
that I am ready to pour over you

131
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,240
正如炖苹果扑在烤猪肉上
like apple sass over roasted pork.

132
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,290
特伦查德先生
Mr. Trenchard!

133
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,130
你在我面前  跟我女儿滔滔不绝起来了
You are addressing my daughter, and in my presence!

134
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,880
没错  只要她想
Yes! I'm offering her my heart

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,800
我的心以及我的手都可以奉上
and my hand just as she wants them,

136
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,210
不过心空空  手也空空
with nothing in 'em.

137
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,640
现在我明白了  特伦查德先生
Now, I'm aware, Mr. Trenchard,

138
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,930
你还没学会礼貌这件事...
that you are not used to the manner of polite...

139
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
抱歉  不好意...
Pardon me. I'm sor...

140
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,420
见鬼

00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,570
我知道这对你来说很难  弗雷迪
Well, I know this goes hard with you, Freddie,

285
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,910
但是...但是他们安排的
but... but what they're plannin',

286
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,580
是一场针对公民的军事审判
which is a military trial of civilians,

287
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
是一场暴行
is an atrocity.

288
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,750
不  不是的  她做的才叫暴行
No, no. What she did is an atrocity.

289
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,080
没有无罪的可能
There's no presumption of innocence,

290
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,010
证据无关紧要
no burden of proof,

291
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,040
没有同辈陪审团  也不准上诉
no jury of your peers and no appeal.

292
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,420
很好  你也是林肯的拥趸
All right, you were one of Lincoln's pallbearers, too.

293
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,130
那你怎么能代表她呢
How can you represent her?

294
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,630
她有辩护权  弗雷迪
She's entitled to a defense, Freddie,

295
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,340
所以我要为她辩护
so I shall defend her.

296
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,630
玛丽・E・苏拉特
Mary E. Surratt,

297
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,640
因参与帮助武装叛乱
in aid of the existing armed rebellion against the United States,

298
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,740
你被控招待  窝藏  
you are charged with having received, entertained,

299
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,180
救助以及协助约翰・威尔科斯・布思
harbored, concealed, aided and assisted John Wilkes Booth,

300
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,020
约翰・A・萨拉特及其同伙
John A. Surratt and their confederates...

301
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,190
戴维・E・赫罗尔德
David E. Herold...

302
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,860
刘易斯・佩恩
Lewis Payne...

303
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,160
乔治・A・阿泽特
George A. Atzerodt...

304
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
迈克尔・劳克兰
Michael O'Laughlen...

305
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,700
埃德蒙・斯潘格勒
Edmund Spangler...

306
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,880
塞缪斯・A・马德
Samuel A. Mudd...

307
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,590
以及塞缪斯・阿诺德
and Samuel Arnold...

308
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,410
密谋刺杀前总统
in traitorous and murderous conspiracy to

309
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,720
亚伯拉罕・林肯
kill then-President Abraham Lincoln,

310
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,510
副总统安德鲁・约翰逊
Vice President Andrew Johnson

311
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,010
以及国务卿威廉・苏厄德的叛国行动
and Secretary of State William Seward.

312
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,060
根据特令211及216
Pursuant to special orders number 211 and 216,

313
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,980
你要如何抗辩
how do you plead?

314
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,400
你怎么说  女士
What say you, madam?

315
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,270
有罪还是无罪
Guilty or not?

316
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,070
我是清白的
I am innocent.

317
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,280
那样的话  由于被告各方都作了
In that case, as each of the defendants

318
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,950
无罪抗辩  我们将要开席
has entered a not-guilty plea, we will begin.

319
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,910
军法官霍特  请开始审讯
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.

320
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,130
等一下  法官大人
Just a moment, Your Honor.

321
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,540
什么事  参议员
What is it, Senator?

322
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,550
我...我想提请暂停审讯
I... I wish to request an adjournment.

323
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,550
暂停审讯吗  我们刚刚开始
An adjournment? We just got here.

324
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,680
我的委托人被拘留一个月
My client has been in custody for a month,

325
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,260
昨天才准许与律师联络
wasn't allowed to contact counsel until yesterday.

326
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,060
亨特上将  
General Hunter,

327
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,560
延期只会延长全民的哀伤
a delay will only serve to prolong the nation's sorrow.

328
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,770
我博学的同僚
My learned colleague,

329
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,110
你花了四个多星期准备这个案子
you've had over four weeks to prepare your case,

330
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,440
并且得到了陆军部的帮助
no doubt assisted by the entire War Department.

331
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,780
我认为被告有权受到平等对待
I believe the defendant is entitled to equal consideration.

332
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,780
约翰逊参议员  
Senator Johnson,

333
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,450
我们的同胞都应该早日平息此痛
our fellow citizens must be permitted to put this tragedy to rest.

334
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,420
尽早将此事处理完毕  
The sooner we dispose of this matter,

335
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,450
对大家都有好处
the better... for everyone.

336
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,620
我的委托人除外
Everyone but my client.

337
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,290
霍特法官  请继续
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.

338
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,710
这样的话  我请求此案终止
In that case, I move for termination.

339
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,010
终止
Termination?

340
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,840
因为这种审判是违宪的
On the grounds this trial is unconstitutional.

341
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,720
被告也是美国公民
The defendant is a civilian

342
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,470
有权在同辈陪审团前接受公开审判
entitled to a public trial before a jury of her peers.

343
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,160
总检察长已经
The attorney general has

344
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,100
肯定了此次审判程序的合法性
affirmed the legitimacy of this proceeding.

345
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,560
他是不是把最终裁决也定好了呢
Has he furnished a verdict as well?

346
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,610
参议员
Senator.

347
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,110
你要考虑我们内心的伤痛
You will mind the horror which summons us.

348
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,490
当然
Indeed.

349
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,320
我们都对总统之死沉痛万分
We all mourn the loss of our leader,

350
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,600
但哀思之时  
but in our grief,

351
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,080
也请大家不要因此作出错误判断
let us not betray our better judgment

352
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,500
成为异端审判的一员
and partake in an inquisition.

353
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
异端审判  此话何意
Inquisition? How dare you?

354
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,380
看来我们中有内敌啊
Sounds to me like we have the enemy among us.

355
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,090
马里兰州在战争中就不在我们一方
Maryland not being among our most loyal of states during the war,

356
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,180
州参议员就更应该表明自己的立场
its senator ought to certify his allegiance to this court.

357
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,180
我堂堂司法部长  尽职尽责  
I have served this nation as its attorney general.

358
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,510
这还不足以证明我的立场吗
That is certification enough.

359
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,680
不过我们仍需要辩护律师
Nevertheless, we may require counsel

360
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,850
签署这份效忠宣誓
to sign this oath of loyalty

361
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,650
这是国会的规定
as prescribed by Congress.

362
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,190
我也是国会的一员
I am a member of Congress,

363
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,860
是我们组建了军队
the same body that creates armies,

364
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,610
授权军事裁决
authorizes military tribunals

365
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,530
任命像你这样的少将
and makes major generals like you.

366
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,160
我们是由陆军部长埃德温・斯坦顿亲自授权的
Our authorization comes from the War secretary, Edwin Stanton,

367
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,160
并由总统直接下达指令
and by order of the president.

368
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,580
如果我们的开国元勋们奉行暴政
If our founding fathers had desired tyranny to prevail,

369
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,170
那么他们会纵容
the president and his War secretary

370
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,710
总统和战争部长滥用权利
would have been granted such indiscriminate powers,

371
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,720
而事实上  他们起草了宪法
but they drafted a Constitution

372
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,050
用法律禁止了权利滥用
with laws against such powers.

373
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,930
正是为了防止现在这样的情况发生
They did so precisely for times like this.

374
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,360
肃静  肃静
Order! Order! Order!

375
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,440
我真心希望你能帮助我  弗雷迪
I really want you to do this for me, Freddie.

376
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,570
你不会是认真的吧
You're not serious.

377
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,110
委托人被控重罪  岂能儿戏
As serious as the charges against our client.

378
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,780
我  替她辩护
Me? Defend her?

379
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,580
要是我这样的南方老头给她辩护
She doesn't stand a chance

380
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,920
她必输无疑
with an old Southerner like me defending her.

381
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,920
她需要一个像你这样的北方上尉
She needs a Yankee captain like you.

382
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,130
很抱歉  长官  我无能为力
I'm sorry, sir. I... I can't do it.

383
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,760
不  你能行  小伙子
No, you'll do fine, son.

384
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,970
现在他们随心所欲制定规则
Experience matters for nothing

385
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,390
我的经验毫无用武之地
when they're making up the rules as they go along.

386
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,970
而且  政府从没有对女人处以绞刑
Besides, this government has never executed a woman.

387
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,970
他们从未料到会有人  不管是男是女
They've never considered a woman, nor a man for that matter,

388
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,350
能谋杀总统
capable of murdering the president.

389
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,310
先生  我可以找个叛贼来给她辩护
Sir, I can find you a rebel to defend her,

390
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,270
但我自己不能  也不会这样做
but I ca... I won't do it.

391
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,230
要是用南部联邦的辩护律师
There is no court in the Union

392
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,360
全国没有一个法庭
that would fairly judge that

393
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,990
会对那个女人进行公正裁决
woman with a Confederate counsel.

394
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,660
我不会背叛我的国家
I won't betray my country.

395
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,070
也不会背叛为国捐躯的兄弟们
I won't betray my friends who died defending it.

396
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,080
我并不是让你背叛忠心  弗雷迪
I'm not asking you to betray your allegiances, Freddie.

397
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,660
我只是请求你  或者说告诉你
I'm simply askin' you... rather tellin' you...

398
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,130
要遵守律师的职业操守  全力而为  
to obey your oath as a... as an attorney and do your job.

399
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,130
他要我替玛丽・萨拉特辩护
He wants me to represent Mary Surratt.

400
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,010
什么
What?

401
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,720
-什么  -是啊
- What? - Yeah.

402
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,520
他不是认真的吧
He can't be serious.

403
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,380
他们都是剧院的演员
They're the actors from the theater.

404
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,720
开门
Open up.

405
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,430
谢谢你  
Thank you, soldier.

406
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,060
不客气
That'll be all.

407
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,400
谈话是保密的
This conversation is privileged.

408
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,030
抱歉  先生  这是命令
Sorry, sir. Orders.

409
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,280
约翰逊参议员在哪儿
Where is Senator Johnson?

410
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,490
参议员让我接手你的案子
The senator has instructed me to handle your case.

411
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,710
知道你被指控什么罪名吗
You understand what you've been charged with?

412
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,710
密谋杀害总统
Conspiring to murder the president,

413
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,130
国务卿和副总统
secretary of State and the vice president...

414
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,090
如果罪名成立  你会被处以绞刑  
if found guilty, you could hang?

415
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,720
恕我冒昧  贵姓
No disrespect, Mr...

416
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,390
艾金
Aiken.

417
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,060
艾金先生
Mr. Aiken.

418
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,190
你多大了
How many years have you?

419
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,400
二十七
27.

420
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,360
你以前接过这样的案子吗
So you've handled cases like this before?

421
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,570
以前根本就没有这种案子
There's never been a case like this before.

422
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,410
但你替别人辩护过
But you have defended others.

423
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,120
我到底还是没希望啊
They've left nothing to chance.

424
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,250
行了
Very well.

425
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,210
你在H街 541号有一处客栈
You own a boarding house on 541 H Street?

426
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,250
是吗
Is that correct?

427
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,510
是的
Yes.

428
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,840
你在那儿住多久了
How long you been there?

429
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,800
女士
Ma'am?

430
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,770
我对你的了解不过是报纸上的那些
All I know about you is what I read in the papers.

431
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,850
不是恭维
It's not flattering.

432
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,610
一年前  丈夫死后  
I moved to Washington a year ago

433
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,610
我带着儿子女儿搬到华盛顿
with my son and daughter after my husband passed.

434
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,570
刺客们是你家的常客
And the assassins were frequent visitors to your home.

435
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,870
是的
Yes.

436
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,120
那你
Well, you... heh.

437
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,780
你都不否认你认识约翰・威尔科斯・布思
You don't even deny having been acquainted

438
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,870
和别的犯人吗
with John Wilkes Booth and the others behind bars?

439
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,830
不  不否认
No, sir, I do not.

440
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,550
我丈夫酗酒而死  艾金先生
My husband died a drunk, Mr. Aiken,

441
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,380
给我留了一屁股债
and left me loads of debt.

442
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,820
我要养活全家  
I had to support my family,

443
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,090
所以把房子租给了那些寄宿的
so I rented rooms to boarders.

444
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,970
他们只不过是我的房客
Those men were customers, nothing more.

445
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,390
你就没有考虑过他们的政治立场吗
And you never considered their allegiances?

446
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,890
没有问过
I didn't ask about their allegiances.

447
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,730
你效忠哪一方
What about yours, ma'am?

448
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,980
我是南方人
I am a Southerner.

449
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,310
信天主教
I'm a Catholic

450
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,780
但最重要的  我是个尽责的母亲
and a devoted mother above all else...

451
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,490
不是杀手
but I am no assassin.

452
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,120
你想重获自由  光凭这句保证远远不够
Your freedom is gonna require greater assurances than that.

453
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,830
那你说我应该跟那些将军说些什么
Then you tell me what I should say to those generals.

454
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,500
你得保持沉默
Oh, you can't say a thing.

455
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,340
你不能为自己辩护
You're prohibited from testifying in your own defense.

456
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,010
不过你儿子倒是可以帮你这个忙
Perhaps your son could speak for you.

457
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,680
你知道他藏在哪儿吗
Any idea where he's hiding?

458
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,970
不知道
No, I don't.

459
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,930
那好吧  有人向你解释过这件事吗
All right. Is there anyone who will give your version of events?

460
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,850
你是说事实吗
You mean the truth?

461
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,180
很显然政府
Well, obviously the government

462
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,850
并不相信你说的是事实
believes your version is not the truth.

463
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,440
凭什么
Based on what?

464
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,520
他们不愿公布目击者名单
They're not releasing their list of witnesses

465
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,650
和指控你的证据
or the evidence they'll use against you.

466
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,320
这合法吗
And can they do that?

467
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,650
走这种程序
This kind of proceeding,

468
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
都是他们说了算
they can do to you whatever they want.

469
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,530
那还折腾什么
Well, then what difference does it make?

470
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,410
那些将军已经下定论了
Those generals have made up their minds.

471
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,210
从他们看我的眼神就知道
I can tell by the way they look at me.

472
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,000
看你的眼神
The way they look at you?

473
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,880
和你看我的眼神一样
Just the same way you're looking at me.

474
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,050
我得走了
I have to go.

475
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,430
祝你愉快
Good day.

476
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,140
艾金先生  进来后我就没了女儿的消息
Mr. Aiken, I haven't a word from my daughter since I've been here.

477
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,230
你能顺便帮我看望她一下吗
Would you look in on her for me?

478
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,690
我感激不尽
I'd be most grateful.

479
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,230
谢谢
Thank you.

480
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,680
士兵
Soldier.

481
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,760
我是弗雷德里克・艾金  玛丽・萨拉特的律师
Frederick Aiken, lawyer to Mary Surratt.

482
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:10,970
好极了
It's perfect.

483
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,050
你说什么
Pardon?

484
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,100
安娜・萨拉特吗
Anna Surratt?

485
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,810
我叫弗雷德里克・艾金
My name is Frederick Aiken.

486
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,310
我是你母亲的辩护律师
I'm representing your mother.

487
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,060
什么好极了
What's perfect?

488
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,780
没什么
Uh, nothing.

489
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,360
说说看
No, do tell.

490
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,570
比这更难听的话我都听过
I'm sure I've heard much worse.

491
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,540
我只是在想   
Well, I was just thinking that this would be

492
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,660
这是个密谋推翻政府的好地方
the perfect place to conspire to overthrow the government.

493
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,750
不会招人怀疑
No one would ever suspect.

494
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,870
不是吗
Right?

495
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
就你一个人吗
You alone here?

496
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,340
是的
Yes.

497
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,380
怎么了  你怕被人看到和我在一起吗
Why? Are you afraid to be seen with me?

498
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,720
你母亲让我来看望你
Your mother asked that I look in on you.

499
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,060
告诉她别担心
Please tell her not to worry,

500
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,640
我也不过是个关在家里的囚犯
since I'm a prisoner in my own house.

501
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
你弟弟的房间在哪儿
Where's your brother's room?

502
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,310
二楼左手边
Second floor, on the left.

503
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,560
找到要找的了吗
Did you find what you were looking for?

504
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,400
找到了
Uh, yes.

505
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,400
你弟弟跟L.J. W同住吗
Did your brother share a room with an L.J. W?

路易斯・J・怀克曼
Louis J. Weichmann.

507
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,720
他和我妈亲如母子  
He was like a son to my mother.

508
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,080
他会证明我妈是无辜的
He'll swear she's innocent.

509
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,540
他也失踪了吧
I suppose he's disappeared, too.

510
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,460
你参与内战了吗  艾金先生
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Aiken?

511
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,670
杀过我们的人吗
Kill any on our side?

512
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,180
小姐  你有没有什么房客名单
Miss, do you have any documents

513
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,220
或者账本之类的文件
indicating who stayed here or a ledger of accounts?

514
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,270
你想不想让我帮你母亲
Do you want me to help your mother or not?

515
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,620
还藏了什么东西吗
Is there anything else you're concealing?

516
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,740
比如说
Such as?

517
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,450
比如说你弟弟  如果你知道...
Your brother, to start. Look, if you know...

518
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,800
看到是谁扔的吗
Did you see who threw that?

519
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,880
没有  先生
No, sir.

520
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,100
你没伤着吧
Are you hurt?

521
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,350
我没事
I'm fine.

522
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,520
艾金先生  没什么事的话  我先失陪了
Mr. Aiken, if you have no further need of me...

523
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,850
我要买两个
Here. I'll give you two to sell.

524
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,930
你有这个的新款吗
You have the latest on this one?

525
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,270
我拿两个
That, I'll take two.

564
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,770
第一证人路易斯・怀克曼先生
the prosecution calls as its first witness Mr. Louis Weichmann.

565
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,430
他跟你们不是很亲么  
I thought he was like family.

566
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,160
为什么传唤他
Why are they calling him?

567
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
把你的右手放在圣经上
Place your right hand on this Bible.

568
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,200
我不知道
I don't know.

569
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,360
你是否发誓说出真相
Do you swear to tell the truth,

570
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,340
毫无保留  不加掩饰的真相  
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

571
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,330
以此让上帝帮助你
so help you, God?

572
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,370
我发誓
I do.

573
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,410
请
Please.

574
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,880
你认识被告玛丽・萨拉特吗 
Are you acquainted with the defendant, Mary Surratt?

575
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
是的  我认识
Yes. Yes, I am.

576
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,720
他儿子约翰是我在神学院的同学
I attended Divinity College with her son John.

577
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,550
最近  你住在玛丽・萨拉特的客栈里
And until recently, you resided at the boarding house

578
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,430
是吗
owned by Mary Surratt. Is that correct?

579
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,270
是的  先生
That is correct, sir.

580
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,980
这其中有人在她家里出现过吗
Were any of these men ever present in her home?

581
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,310
有的  先生
Yes, sir.

582
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,110
那边的三个
These three over there

583
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,240
去过几次
on several occasions.

584
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,240
证人指认了
Let the record reflect that the witness has identified

585
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,790
赫罗尔德  佩恩和阿泽特三位犯人
the prisoners Herold, Payne and Atzerodt.

586
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,290
是谁请他们来的
And who invited these men?

587
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,580
约翰・萨拉特
John Surratt.

588
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,670
反对
Objection.

589
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,880
反对
Objection?

590
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,680
根本无法证明约翰・萨拉特认识这些人
There's no way to prove that John Surratt

591
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,970
何来邀请之说呢
even knew these men, let alone invited them.

592
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,560
萨拉特无法出庭
Mr. Surratt's absence from this proceeding

593
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,100
是他自己的问题
is Mr. Surratt's problem.

594
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,350
反对无效  继续  霍特先生
Objection overruled. Continue, Mr. Holt.

595
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,940
约翰・威尔科斯・布思是不是约翰・萨拉特的常客
Was John Wilkes Booth also a frequent guest of John Surratt?

596
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,240
没错  但萨拉特全家都很喜欢他
Indeed, but all the Surratts adored him...

597
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,860
约翰  他姐姐安娜还有他们的母亲
John, his sister Anna and their mother, too.

598
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,530
那么布思先生有没有
And were there ever meetings

599
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,290
参加客栈的密谋
held at the boarding house involving Mr. Booth?

600
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,080
参加了多次  有的时候一开就是两三个小时
Many, sometimes lasting two, three hours

601
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,870
而且都是关门秘密进行
and always in secret, behind closed doors.

602
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,840
那你有没有看到
And did you ever see Mary Surratt

603
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,050
玛丽・萨拉特反对这些会议
object to these, uh, meetings?

604
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,470
没有  先生
No, sir.

605
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,390
或者不允许这些人参加
Or to the presence of those men?

606
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,470
不  她没有
No, she did not.

607
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,640
-谢谢  -她似乎很欢迎他们
- Thank you. - She appeared to welcome them.

608
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,850
谢谢  无需补充  怀克曼先生
Thank you. That'll be all, Mr. Weichmann.

609
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,350
你说这些秘密会议一般开多久
How long did you say these secret meetings lasted?

610
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,640
至少两三个小时
At least two, three hours.

611
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,180
你计时的吗
You were timing them?

612
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,980
如果你计了时
Eh, if you were timing them,

613
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,320
那我猜想  这些秘密会议
I suppose these secret meetings

614
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,980
对你来说  不是秘密了吧
were not, in fact, kept secret from you.

615
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,240
我只是知道有这么回事  先生
I knew about them, sir,

616
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,740
但我不知道会议内容是什么
but I had no knowledge of what they were about.

617
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,370
是不是因为你自己从来不参加
And that is because you never attended any yourself, correct?

618
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,200
正是
Exactly.

619
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,710
为什么呢
Why was that?

620
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,790
我觉得他们可疑
I thought them suspicious.

621
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,210
可疑
Suspicious?

622
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,130
你看  你又不知道会议内容
Well, then, you see, you did know what they were about.

623
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,090
我不知道  先生
No, sir, I did not.

624
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,090
那你怎么会觉得可疑
Then why were your suspicions aroused?

625
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,720
因为我听到了有关叛变的只言片语
By the snatches of rebel conversation

626
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,440
我在门厅里无意中听到的  
I overheard in the hallways

627
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
而且他们总是窃窃私语
and by their frequent whisperings.

628
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,600
好吧  既然你这么在意
Well, in that case, if it was of such great concern to you,

629
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,990
为什么不把这个疑点
why did you not report your

630
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,520
上报给陆军部的长官们呢
suspicions to your superiors at the War Department?

631
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,980
我报了
I did.

632
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,030
是吗
Excuse me?

633
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,360
我的确上报了
I did reveal my suspicions.

634
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,780
还有幸结交陆军部的格里森上尉
I made a confidant of Captain Gleason in the War Department.

635
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,580
艾金先生  如果没有什么
Mr. Aiken, if there's nothing else...

636
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,460
律师先生  你问完了吗
Counselor, will that be all?

637
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,630
完了
Uh, yes.

638
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,090
不
Uh, no.

639
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,260
不  我还有一些要问的
No. No, I do have something else.

640
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,980
告诉我  怀克曼先生  告诉我们大家
Tell me, Mr. Weichmann. Tell us all.

641
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,440
-你有没有去过里士满  -反对
- You ever been in Richmond? - Objection.

642
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,270
我只是想知道证人
I merely wish to know if the witness

643
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,650
有没有去过南部联邦的首都
has ever visited the capital of the Confederacy.

644
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,570
我不记得了
I don't recall.

645
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:57,030
这张车票收据或者可以唤起你的记忆
Then perhaps this train receipt will refresh your memory.

646
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,910
上面显示目的地是里士满
It indicates passage to Richmond,

647
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,830
还有签有你名字的首字母
and it has your initials on it.

648
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,790
是的
Yes.

649
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,870
的确如此
That's right.

650
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,500
我打算战后在那里继续学习神学
I considered continuing my divinity studies there after the war.

651
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,510
我想成为一名牧师
I plan on becoming a priest.

652
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,760
很好
That's very nice.

653
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,760
你记得吗  怀克曼先生
Do you recall, Mr. Weichmann,

654
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,680
你打算进入里士满的哪所学校呢
at which institute in Richmond you were thinking of enrolling?

655
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
学校的名字吗
The name?

656
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,100
是的  怀克曼先生  学校名字
Yes, Mr. Weichmann, the name.

657
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,980
-当地没有这类的学校  -反对
- There is no academy of the kind... - Objection.

658
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,400
在里士满有吗  怀克曼先生
...in Richmond, is there, Mr. Weichmann?

659
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,840
事实上  你去里士满肯能是为了  
In fact, perhaps you visited Richmond...

660
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,270
反对  上将
Objection, General.

661
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,610
完全为了其他目的
...for another purpose entirely.

662
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,820
反对有效
Objection sustained.

663
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,670
你在主管叛军囚犯的上将
You worked for the general

664
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,660
的手下工作  是吧
in charge of rebel prisoners, did you not?

665
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,820
是的
Yes.

666
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,910
又如何
So?

667
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,450
像你这样出色的职员
Perhaps a distinguished

668
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,370
可能知道一些消息
clerk like yourself knew certain information.

669
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,910
哪方面的消息
What sort of information?

670
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,790
让南部首都叛党
Information that might have been of divine interest

671
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,340
十分感兴趣的消息
to certain rebels within the capital of the Confederacy.

672
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
反对  上将
Objection, General.

673
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,260
证人不是审判席的被告
The witness is not on trial here.

674
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,840
他本应受审
Well, he ought to be!

675
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,930
反对有效
Objection sustained.

676
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,550
证人不是来受审的
The witness is not on trial.

677
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,890
长官  我只是在求证证人的可信度
Sir, I am merely trying to establish the witness' credibility

678
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,850
准确来讲  是证明此人不可信
or rather the lack of credibility of this man.

679
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,980
艾金先生  你在给证人入罪
Mr. Aiken, you are incriminating the witness.

680
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,190
这算入罪吗  长官
Incriminating? Sir,

681
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,860
路易斯・怀克曼和约翰・萨拉特住同一个房间
Louis Weichmann shared a room with John Surratt.

682
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,490
我手头上有一张车票表明他去过里士满
I have a ticket that puts him in Richmond.

683
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,240
我认为有足够的理由相信
I think it reasonable to assume

684
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,950
他对此次刺杀总统的阴谋的了解
that he knows more about this plot to assassinate our president

685
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,530
比他告诉我们的要多
than he supposedly reported.

686
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,990
艾金先生的猜测缺乏实质根据
What Mr. Aiken thinks is entirely immaterial.

687
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,660
辩方律师  如果你没有相关的问题
Counselor, unless you have something more relevant to ask,

688
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,330
证人就退下了
the witness will step down.

689
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,500
没有问题了
No.

690
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,710
没有相关的问题了
No, I have nothing more... relevant to ask.

691
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,190
你绝对不能问一个
You never... you never ask a question

692
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,190
你不知道答案的问题
you don't know the answer to.

693
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,400
我明白
I know. I know.

694
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,510
你怎么知道怀克曼
How... How did you know Weichmann

695
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,320
在里士满的问题上撒谎呢  弗雷德
was lying about Richmond, Fred?

696
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,990
-我不知道  -你居然不知道
- I didn't. - You didn't?

697
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,120
那你是赌了两次啊
S-so you gambled twice?

698
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,040
你怎么通过律师考试的
How did you pass the bar?

699
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,160
但是这招管用
Well, well, it worked.

700
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,540
弗雷德让怀克曼看上去跟其他人一样有罪
I mean, Fred made Weichmann look as guilty as the others.

701
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,250
-好极了  -那是
- It was perfect. - You're right.

702
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,090
这就是问题所在
And that's the problem.

703
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,590
他们都貌似有罪
They all look guilty.

704
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,760
弗雷迪  抱歉
Freddie, I'm sorry.

705
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,010
首先参议员把你当事人当作包袱一样扔掉
First the senator drops your client like a load,

706
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,430
接着所有密谋的会议
and then with all these secret meetings taking place,

707
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,470
或者她知道其内情
either she knew what was going on...

708
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,770
还是她该死的"被知道"呢
Or she damn well should have known.

709
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,190
参议员
Senator?

710
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,940
在里面
In here.

711
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:50,580
我认为她跟布思一样有罪
I think she's as guilty as Booth.

712
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,620
我又怎能为她辩护呢
How could I possibly defend her?

713
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,750
你跟审判委员会一样  预设了她是有罪的
You assume that she's guilty, like the Commission.

714
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,420
你没有任何证据和证明
You don't have any proof.

715
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,630
无论有没有证据
Proof or no,

716
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,300
都不会改变她做过的事情
don't give a damn what happens to her.

717
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,970
我可以告诉你
I tell you what.

718
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,020
如果你可以证明她有罪
If you can prove that she's guilty,

719
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,350
你就不用再管这案子
you can take yourself off the case.

720
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,020
谢谢你  长官
Thank you, sir.

721
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,730
你觉得事情会很简单吗
You think it'll be that easy?

722
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,190
我明白
I know it.

723
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,870
抱歉  神父
Pardon me, Father.

724
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,170
我想跟犯人谈一谈
I wish to confer with the prisoner.

725
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,000
如果你不介意  我想单独谈一谈
Alone, if you don't mind.

726
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,840
没问题  玛丽
It's... It's quite all right, Mary.

727
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,510
我也正要走了
I... I must be going anyway.

728
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,180
好的  谢谢你来看我  神父
All right. Well, thank you for visiting, Father.

729
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,140
再见
I'll see you soon.

730
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,560
你的话让我很安慰
Your words were most comforting.

731
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,970
主与你同在
The Lord's with you.

732
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,900
她绝食
She's refusing to eat.

733
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,150
我已经尽量说服她这样是没好处的
I've tried to convince her to no avail.

734
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,030
可能你可以帮她
Perhaps you could help her.

735
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,000
求你鉴察我  知道我的心思
"Search me, and know my heart.

736
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:21,130
 旧约圣经  诗篇

737
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,000
试炼我  知道我的意念
Try me, and know my thoughts.

738
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,130
看在我里面有什么恶行没有
And see if there be any wicked way in me."

739
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,010
主洞悉罪恶
"The Lord knows the way of the wicked.

740
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,800
 旧约圣经  箴言篇

741
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,800
罪恶将消失
And the way of the wicked will perish."

742
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,180
你熟读箴言  年轻人
You know your Proverbs, young man.

743
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,680
我父亲是牧师
My father was a minister.

744
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,640
小时候他教我的
He taught them to me as a child.

745
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:43,070
那么  你想知道什么
So, what is it you wish to know?

746
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,240
为什么布思和他的同党是你家的常客呢
Why Booth and his associates were constants in your home.

747
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,780
我开客栈的  艾金先生
I ran a boarding house, Mr. Aiken.

748
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,120
招待房客有何不妥
Forgive me if I chose to fill it with boarders.

749
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,830
我查过客栈的入住登记  太太
I checked your registry, ma'am.

750
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,580
并没有显示布思曾经入住
There's no record Booth ever stayed at your home.

751
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,880
事实上
No, the fact is he stayed

752
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,250
他每次来华盛顿都住在国家广场附近
at the National whenever he came to Washington,

753
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,250
那为什么布思会在你家呢
so why was Booth in your home?

754
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,590
估计是我儿子请他来的  他们是朋友
I suppose my son invited him. They were friends.

755
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,800
像布思这样的著名演员
Famous actor like Booth?

756
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,850
会跟你儿子这么熟吗
Engaging your son out of friendship?

757
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,220
艾金先生  我儿子是跟你一样的年轻人
Mr. Aiken, my son is no less a gentleman than you

758
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,730
善于结交朋友
and very capable of forming acquaintances in society.

759
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,980
我问过你家的所有熟人
I've... I've read all about your family's acquaintances, ma'am,

760
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,990
关于你的丈夫对南方邦联事业的贡献
about how your late husband contributed to the Confederate cause

761
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,860
以及你的乖儿子约翰尼
and about your Gentleman Johnny.

762
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,780
他怎么了
What about him?

763
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,450
他通过在北方联邦边界
He made quite a sum as a

764
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,830
传送叛军秘密情报赚了一大笔
courier carrying rebel secrets across Union lines.

765
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:38,190
我很清楚你们一家子的底细  
Oh, I'm well aware of what your family's capable of,

766
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,290
萨拉特太太
Mrs. Surratt,

767
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,130
我知道你没说真话
so I know you're not telling me the truth.

768
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,590
说说看我隐瞒什么了
Well, then you know what I do not.

769
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,880
你为战败沮丧
You were despondent over losing the war,

770
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,890
你想必竭尽所能挽救南方邦联
and you would have done anything you could to save the Confederacy,

771
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,430
包括利用你的儿子
including using your own son John.

772
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,680
老实说  艾金先生
Honestly, Mr. Aiken.

773
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,970
你安排与布思见面
So you arranged a meeting with Booth,

774
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,100
估计他会因为你儿子作为一个情报员
figuring he'd befriend your son because of what he knew,

775
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,560
所知道的消息而去帮助他
what expert couriers do know.

776
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,980
那会是什么情报呢
And what might that be?

777
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,150
逃出本城的最佳路线
The best escape routes out of town.

778
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,130
那个晚上你儿子应该是负责
Your son was supposed to lead

779
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,070
带其他人逃跑的  对吧
the others to freedom that night, wasn't he?

780
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,200
否则怎么可能只有他一个逃得掉呢
Except he was the only one that got away.

781
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,370
那晚我儿子在加拿大
My son was in Canada that day.

782
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:15,700
你能证明吗
Can you prove that?

783
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,620
四月十四日  我收到一封信
I received a letter on April 14,

784
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,080
正是刺杀当日
same day as the assassination,

785
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,840
那封信是从蒙特利尔寄来的
sent from Montreal.

786
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,880
现在信在哪里
Where is this letter?

787
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,510
我不知道
I don't know.

788
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,340
算了
I'm done,

789
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,680
我没法继续为你的谎言辩护
done defending your lies.

790
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,010
怨恨使你盲目  艾金先生
You're so blind with hatred, Mr. Aiken,

791
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,430
让你看不见真相
you can't even see the truth.

792
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,100
是的  我儿子憎恨北方  我们所有人都是
Yes, my son hated the North. We all did.

793
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,580
除了对你们的怨恨
How can a Southerner feel anything

794
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,940
南方人还能有什么感想
anything but bitterness toward your side?

795
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,940
但是我儿子没有合谋刺杀你们的总统
But my son did not conspire to kill your president.

796
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,480
他只是合谋绑架他
He conspired to kidnap him.

797
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,200
好  他来了
All right, here he comes.

798
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,120
准备好马匹
Ready your mount.

799
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,790
萨拉特  布思哪里去了
Surratt, where the hell's Booth?

800
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:04,380
他会来的
He'll be here.

801
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,760
好  稳住了
All right, steady.

802
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,470
等一下
Wait!

803
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,810
他不来了
He's not coming!

804
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,680
林肯改变了计划
Lincoln's changed his plans.

805
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,480
-什么  -他还在城里
- What? - He's still in town.

806
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,610
他在国家广场发表演讲
He just gave a speech at the National.

807
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,790
安娜  回到楼上去
Anna, back upstairs.

808
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,760
马车里的是谁
Who was in the carriage?

809
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,680
这不重要  问题是他不在马车里
Doesn't matter. What matters is he wasn't in the carriage.

810
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,720
你应该知道的
You should have known.

811
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,760
武器怎么办
What about the weapons?

812
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,010
我们要把武器藏起来
We need to hide these weapons.

813
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,260
可以放在劳埃德家里
We can take them to Lloyd's.

814
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:00,260
交给我吧
I'll take 'em.

815
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:01,810
你这是自绝死路
You'd shoot your own foot off.

816
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,890
我能办好
I said I'd do it.

817
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,020
不要推我
Don't push me.

818
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,650
够了
Enough!

819
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,900
就是你们这样的笨蛋让我们吃败仗的
Fools like you are the reason we can lose this fight.

820
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,660
约翰尼・萨拉特  我有话要跟你说
Johnny Surratt, I'd like a word with you, please.

821
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,700
约翰尼  你妈喊你呢
Well, answer, Johnny. Your mama's callin'.

822
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,960
他们计划用林肯作为人质
They planned on ransoming Lincoln in exchange

823
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,050
交换监狱里的南方邦联士兵
for all the Confederate soldiers in your prisons.

824
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,630
为什么你不向当局报告这件事
Why didn't you report them to the authorities?

825
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,220
因为他们其中一个是我儿子
Because one of them was my son.

826
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,470
所以现在不是绑架了
So rather than kidnap him,

827
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,220
你儿子成了刺杀总统的帮凶
your son helped murder the president instead.

828
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,260
不
No.

829
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,140
他们几乎抓了副总统和国务卿
They nearly got the vice president and the secretary of State.

830
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,730
不是这样的  不是我的约翰尼做的
No, it's not true. It's not my Johnny.

831
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,480
拜托  太太 
Damn it, ma'am,

832
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,980
你刚刚才说他是布思的得力助手
you just said he was Booth's right hand.

833
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,650
我儿子不是凶手  艾金先生
My son is not a murderer, Mr. Aiken.

834
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,520
那好
All right, then.

835
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,190
对着它发誓
Swear to it.

836
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,370
马上可以吃晚饭了
Supper will be ready shortly.

837
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,830
约翰
John?

838
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,910
我得走了  妈
Can't stay, mama.

839
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,040
我要马上出城
I have to leave town straightaway.

840
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,370
什么事情这么急
What's so pressing?

841
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,130
不用担心
Nothing that need worry you.

842
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,880
只是去处理一些棉花投资生意  没什么
Just some cotton speculatin'. That's all.

843
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,050
别骗我  儿子
Don't sport with me, son.

844
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,130
不说清楚别指望踏出家门一步
You're not steppin' outside this house.

845
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,180
别把我当小孩
Don't talk to me like I'm a child!

846
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,640
里士满快要沦陷  必须有所行动
Richmond's falling. Something must be done.

847
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,810
约翰尼  我也知道里士满的局势
Johnny, I'm aware of the news from Richmond,

848
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,810
也感到很痛心
and it pains me terribly.

849
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:26,930
晚饭做好了
Supper's ready.

850
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,850
怎么回事
Wh-what is it?

851
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,900
我要离开本城
I'm leaving town.

852
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,360
不  你不能走
No, you're not leaving town.

853
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,400
我必须走
Yes, I am.

854
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,070
我只剩你和安娜两个亲人了
You and Anna are the only family I've got left,

855
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,040
如果我让你出去干傻事
and I'll be damned if I let

856
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,650
我会受到报应的
you go out there and do something else foolish.

857
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,820
-傻事  -约翰尼
- Foolish? - Johnny...

858
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,140
我正在做的这事
What I'm fightin' for is

859
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,070
比我们任何一个人都重要
far more important than any of us.

860
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,830
你的家人才是最重要的
Your family is more important than anything.

861
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:43,990
这是你的责任
That is your responsibility!

862
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,080
我们家的男人都死了
All of our men are buried underground right now.

863
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,540
-战争结束了  -你错了
- The war is over. - Oh, you're wrong about that.

864
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,000
没有事情需要你去战斗了
There is nothing left for you to do.

865
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,800
战争远没结束  
The war is far from over,

866
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,830
还有很多事情需要我去做
and there's still plenty I can do.

867
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,090
-约翰尼  求你了  -放开我  妈
- Johnny, please. - Unhand me, Mother.

868
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,340
放开我  妈  
Unhand me, Mother.

869
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,670
约翰
John!

870
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,170
妈
Mother.

871
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,840
约翰  你还来不来
John, are you coming or not?

872
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,050
约翰尼  求你了
Johnny, please.

873
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,180
如果这不值得我去战斗  那什么值得
If this cause ain't worth fightin' for, then what is?

874
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,560
那是不是你最后一次见到你儿子
So that was the last time you saw your son?

875
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,680
是的
Yes.

876
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,730
在刺杀之前不到两个礼拜
Less than two weeks before the assassination?

877
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:11,730
是
Yes.

878
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,520
看  你承认
So then, you see, you admit

879
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,860
你儿子合谋刺杀林肯总统了
that your son conspired to kill President Lincoln.

880
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,030
我不知道
I don't know.

881
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,610
但愿上帝能帮你
May God help you.

882
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,030
说真的  艾金先生  我不知道
Honestly, Mr. Aiken, I don't know.

883
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,750
主  我真的不知道
Lord, I pray not.

884
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:35,130
我所知道的就是我没做过
All I know is that I did not.

885
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,630
我发誓
I swear.

886
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,450
萨拉特小姐
Miss Surratt.

887
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,660
你必须老老实实告诉我...
You have to tell me exactly...

888
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,700
我妈怎样了
How is my mother?

889
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,410
她还撑得住  你必须告诉我
She's managing. You have to tell me

890
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,410
这里到底发生了什么事情
exactly what happened here.

891
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,620
什么意思
What do you mean?

892
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,790
你知道你们的朋友路易斯・怀克曼
Do you know that Louis Weichmann, uh, your friend,

893
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,840
指证你的母亲
testified against your mother

894
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,300
你之前还告诉我他像你妈的儿子一样
after you told me he was like a son to her?

895
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,260
到底怎么回事
What went on here?

896
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
我为什么要相信你
Why should I trust you?

897
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,680
因为你母亲已经把所有事情告诉我了
Because your mother told me everything.

898
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,470
她讲了约翰的事情
She told me about John.

899
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,600
还有绑架林肯总统的阴谋
She told me about the plot to kidnap President Lincoln.

900
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,190
安娜  你有没有尝试阻止他
Anna, did you try and stop him?

901
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:39,190
为什么觉得我要那样做
How was I supposed to do that?

902
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,610
因为你是他姐姐
'Cause you're his older sister.

903
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,820
你不知道我弟弟多么顽固
You don't know how stubborn my brother can be.

904
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,280
好  你弟弟有合谋刺杀总统吗
All right. Did your brother conspire to kill the president?

905
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,120
我弟弟在刺杀之前数周就已经出城了
My brother left town weeks before the assassination.

906
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,620
这证明不了什么  他离开客栈的当晚
It proves nothing. Look, the night he left the boarding house...

907
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,660
我已经把知道的全告诉你了
I've said all I will.

908
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,370
萨拉特小姐  
Miss Surratt, I'm trying...

909
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,790
我在尽力帮你们
I'm trying to help.

910
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,960
以给我弟弟入罪的方式吗
By condemning my brother?

911
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,170
艾金先生  我妈绝不同意这样做  
Mr. Aiken, my mother would never allow that,

912
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:00,960
我也不同意
and neither would I.

913
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:04,880
好  看  你见识过怀克曼了
Oh. All right. All right, look, you knew about Weichmann.

914
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,640
如果你知道谁可能会被检控作为证人传召
If you know any potential witnesses the prosecution might call

915
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,970
或者一些对她不利的证据
or what evidence they'll use against her,

916
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,350
务必告诉我
you must tell me.

917
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,190
你会帮我吗
Will you help me?

918
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,320
让我们跟进一些
Let us proceed with events

919
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,320
总统被刺杀后发生的事情
following the assassination of President Lincoln.

920
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,070
四月十七日晚上
On the night of April 17,

921
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,820
你的职责是什么  史密斯少校
what were your duties, Major Smith?

922
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,740
我负责追捕约翰・萨拉特
I was charged with finding John Surratt,

923
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,830
我们正在搜查房子
and we were searching the house.

924
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,620
少校  我找到这些
Major, I found these.

925
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,370
在他们家女儿的房间找到的
They were here in the daughter's bedroom.

926
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:47,340
史密斯少校  请读出这里题铭的内容
Major Smith, please read aloud what's inscribed here.

927
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,220
暴君必死
"Sic semper tyrannis."

928
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,220
 拉丁文  据说出自刺杀凯撒

929
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,010
可以翻译一下吗
Could you translate?

930
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,100
当然  暴君必死
Of course. "Thus always for tyrants."

931
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,850
这句话你很熟悉吗
Are those words familiar to you?

932
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,100
确实
Indeed.

933
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,110
布思刺杀总统之后喊出了这句话
Booth yelled them after he cut down our president.

934
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,900
事发后三天  你在她女儿房间
You found the same three days later

935
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,360
在杀手照片的旁边
in her daughter's bedroom next to a photograph

936
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,610
看到这句话
of the assassin himself.

937
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:09,530
像是暗语
Like a shrine, sir.

938
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,530
请继续
Please continue.

939
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,910
反对
Uh, objection.

940
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,870
暴君必死  是佛吉尼亚州的格言
Sic semper tyrannis is the state motto of Virginia.

941
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,880
很难证明是布思的暗语
It hardly constitutes proof of a shrine to Booth.

942
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,050
不需要进一步的证据  艾金先生
No further proof is needed, Mr. Aiken.

943
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,260
继续  霍特先生
Proceed, Mr. Holt.

944
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,010
继续  史密斯少校
Continue, Major Smith.

945
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:28,870
正当我准备把
As I was fixing to take

946
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,470
萨拉特一家带回总部问话
the Surratts to headquarters for questioning,

947
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,140
这时有人敲门
there was a knock at the door.

948
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,260
还好吧  太太
You all right, ma'am?

949
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,400
恐怕我找错门了
I... I must be mistaken.

950
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,410
等一等
Wait a minute.

951
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,740
你想找谁
Whom do you wish to see?

952
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,490
萨拉特太太
Uh, Mrs. Surratt.

953
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,790
这里是她家  让他进来
This is her place. Bring him in.

954
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,510
她约了你吗
Is she expecting you?

955
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,930
她让我帮她挖一条排水沟
She sent for me, asked me to dig a gutter for her.

956
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,430
要在晚上这个时候挖吗
At this time of night?

957
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,970
明早  我来问下确切时间
In the morning. I just wanted to know what time.

958
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,020
把萨拉特太太带过来
Bring Mrs. Surratt in here.

959
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,530
太太  你雇了这位先生为你挖水沟吗
Ma'am, did you hire this man to dig a gutter for you?

960
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,280
没有  长官
No, sir.

961
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,820
你认识这个人吗
Do you know this man?

962
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,490
不认识  长官
No, sir.

963
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,040
她否定认识的是这个人吗
Is this the man she denies knowing?

964
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,670
不是
No, sir.

965
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,970
她否定认识的是这个人吗
Is this the man she denies knowing?

966
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,510
是的
Yes, sir.

967
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,300
刘易斯・佩恩
Lewis Payne.

968
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:01,760
就是他  在刺杀国务卿及其亲戚之前 
The same man boarded at the Surratts' prior to

969
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,480
去了萨拉特那里
daggering the secretary of State and his kin.

970
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,770
是的
Yes.

971
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:06,900
谢谢  少校  我没什么要问的了
Thank you, Major. Nothing further.

972
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,340
史密斯少校  你知不知道刘易斯・佩恩
Major Smith, are you aware that Lewis Payne

973
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,100
来到萨拉特客栈时  
boarded at the Surratts'

974
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:31,670
自称是一名
under an alias,

975
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,740
来自巴尔的摩教会的牧师
claiming to be a Baptist minister from Baltimore

976
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,840
名叫伍德
named Wood?

977
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,600
那是萨拉特夫人说的
That's what she claimed.

978
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,640
是吗
She claimed?

979
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,520
我现在要呈交一份证物
I would like to submit

980
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,100
这是萨拉特客栈的
into evidence this ledger of guest accounts

981
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,190
房客入住登记
from the Surratt boarding house.

982
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,620
假如真是这样的话
Supposing, as this evidence

983
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,190
那么根据这件证物
would seem to suggest, that that were the truth...

984
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,150
则可以推测那晚萨拉特夫人
suppose Mrs. Surratt simply failed that night

985
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,820
并没有认出
to recognize Wood the preacher

986
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,410
乔装成挖沟人佩恩的伍德牧师
in the guise of Payne the ditch digger.

987
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:59,240
他就站在她面前  只有三步之遥
He was standing in full view of her not three paces.

988
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,830
亨特上将  我接手这个案子后发现
General Hunter, since accepting this case,

989
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:08,380
我的当事人视力存在缺陷
I have come to learn that my client's eyesight is defective.

990
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,740
我这有一份
I have here a sworn affidavit

991
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,840
她医生的起誓证明
from her doctor stating just that.

992
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,430
史密斯少校  当时是夜里  周围漆黑
Major Smith, it was dark. It was nighttime.

993
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:20,100
玛丽・萨拉特有没有可能
Isn't it possible Mary Surratt simply...

994
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,640
没认出他来
failed to see him?

995
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,350
如果是我  看到一个人打扮成牧师
If I saw a man dressed as a preacher

996
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,100
而两个月后变成一个苦力
and two months later a laborer,

997
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,560
我照样能认出他来
then I would recognize him as the same person.

998
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,570
谢谢  史密斯少校
Thank you, Major Smith.

999
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,730
请简单的回答  是或是不是
A simple yes or no will do.

1000
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,490
有没有可能  她就是没有看清
Is it possible she failed to see him properly?

1001
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,910
有  我说有这可能
Yes, I suppose it's possible.

1002
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,910
我的提问结束了
No further questions.

1003
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:42,950
控方看来除了合理的怀疑之外  
The prosecution seems unable to present any proof of guilt

1004
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,040
不能出示任何有罪的证明
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1005
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,300
有谁能给我拿一份今天的开庭记录
Uh, could somebody bring me the transcript of today's trial?

1006
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,100
我大声读给你听吗
Shall I read it aloud to you?

1007
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,180
埃德
Oh, Ed.

1008
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,310
你那位小朋友现在展开了激烈的辩护
Your young associate is putting up a spirited defense.

1009
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:10,650
让我想起了25年前对簿公堂的某位律师
Reminds me of a certain lawyer I had to face 25 years ago.

1010
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,030
他在你的军队里学会了战斗
Ah, he learned to fight in your army.

1011
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,820
我给你来一杯
Can I get you a drink?

1012
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,860
不  不  我就待一小会儿  勒韦迪
No, no. No, I won't be staying long. Reverdy...

1013
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,040
我了解你为这个国家鞠躬尽瘁
You've done as much for this nation as any man I know.

1014
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,790
咱俩都是  埃德
Oh. Feeling's mutual, Ed.

1015
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,370
你不觉得咱们这两个
Don't you think it's time

1016
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,960
老头子是时候该休战了吗
for us two old war horses to call a truce?

1017
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,420
只要你停止这场闹剧就行
Not if you insist on staging this travesty.

1018
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,550
这项审判对于和平
This trial will do more to keep the peace

1019
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,550
比任何纸上的协议  都要来得重要
than any paper treaty could.

1020
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,010
你怎么能够就那么确信
Heh. How'd you convince yourself of that?

1021
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,640
因为公正  迅速且坚定的判决
Because justice, swift and firm,

1022
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,650
会使南部诸州的任何阴谋势力望而却步
will help deter the South from ever conspiring again,

1023
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:52,650
也能使北部的复仇势力失去勇气
as well as discouraging the North from seeking revenge.

1024
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,570
那法律的原则该怎么办
What about the rule of law?

1025
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,430
我的第一要务就是
My first responsibility is to ensure that

1026
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,490
保证这场战争的胜利
this war stays won.

1027
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,780
这就是你的方式吗
Oh, and this is how you do it,

1028
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,280
通过利用恐惧来达到你的目的
by keeping fear alive as long as you see fit?

1029
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,200
看  "斯坦顿警告今后叛党的阴谋"
Look. "Stanton warns of future rebel plots,"

1030
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,830
水中下毒
uh, water supplies poisoned, um...

1031
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,040
焚烧城市
firebombing cities.

1032
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,130
黄热病蔓延整个地区
Uh, yellow fever spreading all over the place.

1033
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,840
这已经是一个足够叫人害怕的国家  埃德
This is a frightened country, Ed.

1034
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,420
不需要你再来添把手
You don't need to scare us anymore.

1035
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,840
那谁能说这种事情不会发生
And who is to say that none of these things could happen?

1036
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,680
如此难以想象的事情已经发生了
The unspeakable already has...

1037
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,970
我们的总统被暗杀  六十万人死去
Our president assassinated, 600,000 dead.

1038
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,850
勒韦迪  世界已经变了
The world has changed, Reverdy.

1039
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:32,060
可放弃宪法绝不是办法
Abandoning the Constitution is not the answer.

1040
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,360
你也许更喜欢独自用餐
You may prefer dining alone.

1041
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,410
我只是希望你那位小朋友也明白
I just hope your young associate does as well.

1042
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,030
如果他逼得太紧了
If he pushes too hard,

1043
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,910
那么他要面对的敌人会让他一生难忘
he will make enemies who will not soon forget.

1044
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:48,700
对于这点  你最清楚
On this, you know I'm right.

1045
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,160
我来见斯坦顿部长  伙计们
I'm here to see Secretary Stanton, boys.

1046
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,750
退下
Stand down.

1047
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,280
抱歉  先生
Sorry, sir. Mr. Stanton

1048
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,460
没有预约的话  斯坦顿先生不见任何人
doesn't see anyone without an appointment.

1049
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,040
好吧  早上好  艾金先生
Well, good morning, Mr. Aiken.

1050
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,090
早上好
Morning.

1051
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:39,340
我也许能给点帮助
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

1052
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,170
你能给
If you can arrange an

1053
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,920
我和秘书长安排个预约吗
appointment for me with the secretary, you can.

1054
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,090
不走运  他最近非常忙
Unfortunately he's quite busy right now,

1055
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,300
要不你先跟我说几句吧
but perhaps you'd care to have a word with me instead.

1056
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:48,680
请
Please.

1057
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,440
我的委托人情况不太好
My client is unwell.

1058
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,940
我也听说了  女人的诅咒
So I hear. Touch of the woman's curse.

1059
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,160
我要确保她在几天之后
I'm sure she'll be well

1060
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,360
可以正常出庭
enough to continue her trial in a few days.

1061
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,690
她已经被单独囚禁了一个多月了
She's been in solitary confinement for over a month.

1062
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,820
一个多星期都没进食
She hasn't eaten in over a week.

1063
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,030
是她拒绝进食
She's refusing to eat.

1064
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,030
所有的囚犯每天都提供伙食
All the prisoners are fed daily.

1065
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,370
软面包和腌肉
Soft bread and salted meat.

1066
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,830
除非她能得到适当的饮食和一些新鲜空气
Unless she has a proper meal and some fresh air,

1067
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,700
否则我不能保证她能正常出庭
I can't guarantee she'll be fit for trial.

1068
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,960
其中一个共犯拒绝黑人看守
One of the conspirators refuses to be guarded by a Negro,

1069
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,380
而另一个坚持只吃他妈做的饭
and the other insists on only eating his mother's cooking.

1070
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,630
我们不可能每个人都要满足
We can't accommodate every whim.

1071
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,070
算了吧   我只是在请求你们
Come now. I am merely asking

1072
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,220
不要把她当成野蛮人那样对待
for you to stop treating her like a savage.

1073
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:26,300
你竟敢指责我们野蛮
How dare you accuse us of savagery?

1074
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,060
你难道忘记了反叛者是如何对待我们的
Have you forgotten how our own were treated by the rebels?

1075
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,100
当然没有
Of course not.

1076
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,980
但是玛丽・萨拉特现在病得很重
But Mary Surratt is in serious decline.

1077
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,970
如果再这么下去
If this treatment of her continues,

1078
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,650
她早晚会垮掉
she will not be sound of mind.

1079
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:42,320
而我相信这是政府想要避免的
And I trust that is something the government wishes to avoid.

1080
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,740
那我想想办法  尽量照顾各方利益
I may have a way to serve all interests.

1081
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:52,870
这事别跟别人说   明白了吗
I'll deny ever telling you this. Understood?

1082
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,680
神父
Father.

1083
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,760
律师
Counselor.

1084
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,230
阳光真好
Feel that sun.

1085
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,400
我是不是该向你道谢
Do I have you to thank for this?

1086
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,610
谢谢
Well, thank you.

1087
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:33,030
但愿你能有个好胃口
Well, if I could just get you to start eating.

1088
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,460
一  一
Left. Left.

1089
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,870
一  二  一
Left, right, left.

1090
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,000
立定
Company halt.

1091
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,420
玛丽  有些事我必须问清楚
Mary, there's something I need to ask you.

1092
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,670
年轻人  你总是这么多问题
I've never seen you at a loss for words, young man.

1093
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,760
你知道你儿子藏在哪里吗
Do you know where your son is hiding?

1094
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:54,850
约翰尼
Johnny?

1095
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:55,970
当然不知道
Of course not.

1096
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,520
政府认为你知道
Government believes you do.

1097
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,190
你相信吗
What do you believe?

1098
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,530
我认为你还有很多事情没告诉我
I believe you know more than you're willing to tell me.

1099
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,190
你有没有比你自己  
Uh, have you ever cared for something

1100
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,240
更加关心的事
greater than yourself?

1101
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,080
我花费将近四年时间
I've spent these last four years

1102
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,540
为比我更加重要的事而奋斗
fighting for something greater than myself,

1103
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,420
所以不必...
so don't...

1104
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,130
那么我们是同一种人
Then we are the same.

1105
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,220
玛丽  你必须要告诉我们你的儿子在哪
Mary, you have to tell us where your son is.

1106
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,890
你们
Us?

1107
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,150
我必须得告诉"你们"
I have to tell "Us"?

1108
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,650
你到底是站在哪边
Whose side are you on?

1109
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:45,150
我在努力帮你辩护
I'm trying to defend you.

1110
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,320
那就建议我为了自己而出卖儿子吗
By suggesting I trade my son for myself?

1111
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,820
你是在努力保护你自己  艾金先生
You're trying to save you, Mr. Aiken.

1112
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,660
我也很想告诉你  你需要的东西  真的
I wish I could give you what you need. I truly do.

1113
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,160
但你如果想  还是换换别的法子吧
But if you want out, you'll have to find another way.

1114
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,090
我要去散步
I'm gonna take a walk.

1115
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,420
外面真好
It's so nice out.

1116
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,800
要跟我一起来吗
Do you care to walk with me?

1117
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,760
所以我们被困在这些浅壕里
So we're stuck in these shallow trenches.

1118
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,970
四面被围
We're surrounded on all sides.

1119
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,810
没人知道该干什么  该说什么
Nobody knows what to do. Nobody knows what to say.

1120
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,020
我们一动不动  呆若木鸡
We're frozen, completely petrified.

1121
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,560
然后就在附近某个山头
And then from somewhere up on the hill,

1122
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,770
我们听到了大量南方反叛军的声音
we hear this loud booming Southern voice.

1123
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,020
这时反叛军官大声喊道
It's the rebel general.

1124
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,280
"你们这帮家伙最好开始祈祷吧"
He yells, "Y'all boys better say your prayers,

1125
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,820
"因为你们才一百人  而我们是四倍于你"
because there are 400 of us and only 100 of you."

1126
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,200
贝克  你停下别说了
You can stop right there, Baker.

1127
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,450
然后这个疯狂的男人  站了起来
And so then this madman, he stands up,

1128
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:36,660
他大声回答道
and he yells back to him, and he says...

1129
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,870
"见鬼  我们连一百人都没有"
he says, "Hundred? Heck, we've got less than that.

1130
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,080
"但是我们绝不投降  你们来吧"
But we don't surrender, so come and get us."

1131
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,120
同时
And with that,

1132
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,540
他脱下了裤子  用屁股朝向敌军
he pulls down his pants and bares his arse.

1133
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,250
你不会的
You didn't.

1134
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,380
-当然不会  -什么
- I didn't. - What?

1135
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,380
我认为弗雷德是个不会投降的人
It doesn't seem as though Fred ever intends to surrender.

1136
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,130
不过现在看来他已经学会投降了
Ah, it appears he already has.

1137
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,010
她四十岁  美丽  端庄
She's fair, fit and 40.

1138
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,470
萨拉特夫人是名天主教徒
Is it true Mrs. Surratt is a Catholic,

1139
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,310
而且从头到脚穿着黑色的衣服  是真的吗
wears black from head to toe?

1140
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:03,540
我听说她只要遇到联邦军人
I hear she spits in the

1141
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,810
就会向士兵脸上吐痰
faces of every Union soldier she encounters.

1142
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,960
她还带着一条
Apparently she wears a necklace made

1143
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,980
用联邦士兵骨头制成的项链
from the bone of a Union soldier.

1144
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,030
说真的  弗雷德  你真觉得她没罪吗
Seriously, Fred, do you honestly doubt she's guilty?

1145
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:18,870
好吧  谁想要来跳支舞
So, okay, who would like to dance?

1146
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,870
-好的  -好的  不错
- Yes. - Yes. Good.

1147
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,180
这曲子?
Dance?

1148
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,850
都要让人睡着了
It's more like a wake.

1149
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:40,960
为了配合这曲子  
I suppose I should have

1150
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,390
我该学学萨拉特夫人的穿着
dressed more like Mrs. Surratt.

1151
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,690
弗雷德  你在干什么
Fred, what are you doing?

1152
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:50,020
我在忍受贝克的琴声
I'm enduring the pain of having to listen to Baker.

1153
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,230
你知道我说是什么意思
You know what I mean.

1154
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,510
如果她被判有罪  
If she's found guilty,

1155
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:54,740
他们就会说你玩忽职守
they'll say you weren't up to the task.

1156
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:57,950
即使万一你胜利了
And God forbid you prevail.

1157
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:01,030
他们也会把你跟她同归于卖国贼
They'll think you just as much a traitor as she.

1158
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,410
贝克  来个开心点的曲子怎么样
Baker, how 'bout something a little happier?

1159
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,420
-开心点的  -是的
- Little happier? - Yeah.

1160
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,340
好的  弗雷德要求开心一点的
All right, Fred. Happier, he wants.

1161
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,720
威廉说的对
William's right, you know.

1162
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,060
无论选哪条路  你都不会获胜
Either outcome, you cannot prevail.

1163
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,520
萨拉
Sarah.

1164
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,390
到底是玛丽・萨拉特哪方面如此吸引你
What is it about Mary Surratt you find so compelling?

1165
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,060
那些人都是些卑鄙的罪犯  弗雷德
These are criminal, despicable people, Fred.

1166
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:32,400
他们都是同一类人
They're... they're the same sort of people

1167
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,400
你在冒着生命危险来抗衡
you risked your life fighting against,

1168
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,570
而她却是杀死总统的帮凶
and she helped kill your commander in chief.

1169
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,490
我不知道她犯了什么罪
I don't know what she's guilty of.

1170
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,080
那我能再问你一件事吗
May I ask you one more thing?

1171
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,160
萨拉  是什么
What is it, Sarah?

1172
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,170
上尉还记得怎么跳舞吗
Does the captain remember how to dance?

1173
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:55,630
当然
Of course.

1174
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,600
人们不会忘记你曾为这个国家而战斗
Few people will forget what side you fought on.

1175
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,480
相信我  就是有些孤独
Trust me. It can be lonely.

1176
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,560
我只用心是在做一名律师的本分工作
I'm just upholding my oath as an attorney

1177
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,650
这是你曾对我的要求
and doing my job. It's what you asked.

1178
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,520
也是你告诉我该做的
It's what you told me to do.

1179
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,890
引用我的话来反驳我  
This habit of quoting me back to me

1180
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:16,940
真让人恼火
could become most irritating.

1181
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,080
你有你母亲的说服力
You have your mother's

1182
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,360
还继承了你父亲的臭毛病
convictions and your father's annoying habits.

1183
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:23,620
"弗雷迪  既然玛丽・萨拉特享有辩护的权利"
Well, "Mary Surratt is entitled to a defense, Freddie,

1184
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,370
"那么我就该为她辩护"
so I shall defend her."

1185
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:32,170
如果他们想要约翰・萨拉特
If they want John Surratt,

1186
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,920
那就应该把他送上法庭
then you should serve him up on a platter.

1187
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,380
我的意思不是指他本人  而是他的罪行
I... I don't mean, uh, physically. I mean in spirit.

1188
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,850
你要向陪审团证明是他的责任
You have to prove to the Commission

1189
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:46,890
而不是萨拉特夫人
that he is responsible, not her.

1190
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,480
我想她应该不会同意这样做
She's not gonna like that.

1191
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:54,020
劳埃德先生  你是玛丽・萨拉特的一名租户  是吗
Mr. Lloyd, you are a tenant of Mary Surratt, are you not?

1192
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,150
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

1193
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:57,650
我租了她的一块地开家酒馆
I run a tavern some 10 miles from the city

1194
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,320
离市区10英里远
on a property she owns.

1195
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,570
在林肯遇刺的当天下午
And on the afternoon that President Lincoln was assassinated,

1196
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,910
玛丽・萨拉特去找你了吗
did Mary Surratt pay you a visit?

1197
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:12,020
是的  在路易斯・怀克曼的陪同下
Yes, sir, in the company of Louis Weichmann.

1198
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,320
她给了你一个包裹  有没有
And she brought you a package, did she not?

1199
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,820
是的  没错  先生
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.

1200
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,700
小包裹  用报纸包着的  
Small package wrapped in newspaper.

1201
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,840
包裹从哪里来的  她告诉你了吗
Did she tell you where the package came from?

1202
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,300
约翰・威尔科斯・布思那里来的
Said it came from John Wilkes Booth.

1203
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,010
约翰・威尔科斯・布思
John Wilkes Booth!

1204
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:36,850
她给你的包裹里到底是什么
And what exactly did she give you?

1205
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:38,310
反对
Objection.

1206
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:40,730
被告根本不清楚里面是什么东西
There's no way the defendant could have known what was inside.

1207
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,520
他只是证明了那东西被报纸包着
He just testified the package was wrapped.

1208
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,110
反对无效
Overruled.

1209
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,820
证人继续回答问题
Witness will answer the question.

1210
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,910
劳埃德  那个包裹里是什么东西
Mr. Lloyd, what was inside the package?

1211
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:52,280
是望远镜  先生
Field glasses, sir.

1212
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,490
望远镜
Field glasses?

1213
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:54,830
这种望远镜吗
Field glasses like these?

1214
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:56,040
没错
Exactly.

1215
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,460
上面刻着"J.W.B"
With the initials "J.W.B." Inscribed on them.

1216
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,550
那她跟你交代了什么
Did she give you any instructions?

1217
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,010
什么
Sir?

1218
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,130
她对你的交代  劳埃德先生
Instructions, Mr. Lloyd?

1219
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,680
那个会影响这次审判走向的交代
Instructions which may affect this trial?

1220
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,810
是的  先生
Oh. Yes, sir.

1221
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:17,430
她跟我交代
Ahem. She told me,

1222
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,640
"劳埃德  把那些枪准备好"
"Lloyd, get those shootin' irons ready.

1223
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:24,190
"今晚会有人来取走它们"
There will be parties here tonight who will call for them."

1224
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:25,230
你个骗子
You liar!

1225
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,280
肃静
Order!

1226
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,400
-他是个骗子  -肃静
- He's a liar! - Order!

1227
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,530
-这是骗人的  -肃静
- It's a lie. - Order!

1228
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,610
请你克制一下  女士
Control yourself, madam.

1229
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:35,990
大吵大闹  只会加重别人对你的偏见
Such outbursts will only prejudice your case.

1230
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,290
主啊
Oh, Lord.

1231
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,990
我就是不明白
I just don't see how I could

1232
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,040
对我怎么还能更加偏见  先生
possibly further prejudice this case, sir.

1233
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,420
律师  约束下你的委托人
Counselor, you will control your client.

1234
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,090
上将
General.

1235
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:52,220
枪
Shooting irons!

1236
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,390
枪
Shooting irons.

1237
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,390
她还说了什么
And to what was she referring?

1238
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:57,810
是军用步枪  先生
Army rifles, sir,

1239
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:00,890
藏在餐厅顶子上的栅栏里
hidden in the joist above the dining room.

1240
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,390
还有什么
And what else did she tell you?

1241
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,940
她还让我去准备两瓶威士忌
She said I was to get two bottles of whiskey ready, too.

1242
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:11,070
你刚所说的内容
And were these things called for,

1243
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,030
都是被告交代你去做的吗
as per the defendant's instructions?

1244
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:14,070
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

1245
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,410
然后半夜的时候  先生
About midnight, sir,

1246
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,240
就是刺杀行动当晚
the night of the assassination,

1247
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:20,410
两个骑马的人来找我
by two men on horses, one...

1248
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,790
一个认识
I'd seen before.

1249
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,130
另一个不认识 
T'other was a stranger to me.

1250
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,360
我认为他们就是
I brought the items,

1251
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,520
萨拉特夫人交代拿货的人  
thinking these were the parties

1252
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,720
所以就把东西交给他们
Mrs. Surratt meant.

1253
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,280
那两个骑马的立刻就走了
Two of 'em rode off so fast,

1254
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,320
一溜烟就奔出去两英里
they could have outrun Creation and give it two-mile a start.

1255
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:00,790
换你提问
Your witness.

1256
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,410
我不会...
I did not...

1257
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,670
劳埃德先生
Mr. Lloyd.

1258
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,760
劳埃德先生  你刚刚证实
Mr. Lloyd, you just testified

1259
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,400
那天下午路易斯・怀克曼
that Louis Weichmann accompanied

1260
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,220
一直陪着被告
the defendant that afternoon.

1261
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,510
是的
Right.

1262
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,520
那么就是说
So then I can correctly assume

1263
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,990
他也能证明
that he would also testify

1264
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:26,190
萨拉特夫人对你的交代
to having heard her instructions to you.

1265
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,770
不会
No.

1266
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:31,150
她把我叫到远处的柴堆  跟我说的
She took me out by the woodpile out of earshot.

1267
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:35,070
那么你是说没人能听到这段谈话
So you're saying that nobody heard this conversation,

1268
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,490
除了你和她
just you and her.

1269
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,570
就是这样  先生
Way it happened, sir.

1270
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:42,290
当然
Of course it is.

1271
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:48,000
你什么时候听说林肯总统遇刺的
When did you learn of President Lincoln's assassination?

1272
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,340
谁能忘记
Well, who can forget when they heard?

1273
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,010
第二天早晨  科廷厄姆上尉告诉我的
The next morning, a Captain Cottingham told me.

1274
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,590
他正在搜查刺客
He was searching for the assassins.

1275
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,510
你当时感到非常不安吧
No doubt, you were most upset.

1276
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,310
确实
Indeed.

1277
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,390
所以我灌了一大口酒
I got myself right smart in liquor.

1278
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,860
是啊  你大多数时间都醉醺醺的
Yes, you're... you're right smart in liquor most days,

1279
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,060
-不是吗  劳埃德  -反对
- aren't you, Mr. Lloyd? - Objection.

1280
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:14,090
事实上我听说你最好的顾客就是你自己
In fact, I hear that you're your own best customer.

1281
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:14,740
反对
Objection.

1282
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,900
反对有效
Sustained.

1283
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,370
这个科廷厄姆上尉
This Captain Cottingham,

1284
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:24,880
有没有问你任何有关刺客的情况
did he ask you anything in reference to the assassins?

1285
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,250
他问我有没有什么人经过
He asked if any parties had passed through.

1286
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,460
我就告诉他那两个我认识的
Naturally I told him about the two I knew.

1287
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,590
事实上  你并没有
Actually, you did not.

1288
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:39,220
根据这份目击者证词
According to this witness report,

1289
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:42,550
你整整两天都保持缄默
you said nothing for two days.

1290
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,270
我只是害怕了
I was frightened is all.

1291
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:47,230
我担心刺客会冲着我来
I feared the assassins might come for me.

1292
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:50,540
也有可能  你担心当局会认为
Perhaps, though, you were afraid that the authorities

1293
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:51,800
你是同谋
might consider you an accessory.

1294
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,020
是萨拉特一家
Well, it was through the

1295
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,610
让我陷入了这种局面
Surratts that I got myself in such difficulty.

1296
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,790
萨拉特一家
The Surratts.

1297
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:02,000
更确切地说  是约翰・萨拉特吗
Don't you mean John Surratt, to be more precise?

1298
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,370
最初是不是他
Wasn't it he who brought the shooting irons

1299
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:05,740
将枪带去你的酒馆的
to your tavern door in the first place?

1300
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:06,790
是的
Yeah.

1301
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:09,430
他是当着你的面把枪藏起来的吗
And he showed you where to hide them?

1302
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:10,620
我并不想的
I didn't want to.

1303
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,250
你是说他要求你  逼迫你
So you're saying that he asked you,

1304
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,960
去做你本不想做的事
forced you to do so against your will.

1305
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:18,920
是的
Yes.

1306
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,590
所以他带着枪去了你那
So he brought them to you,

1307
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,930
当着你的面藏了起来
he showed you where to hide them,

1308
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:27,910
又逼迫你违背自己的意愿去藏枪
and he forced you to hide them against your will?

1309
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:29,390
是这样的  就是这样的
That's right. Yes, exactly.

1310
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:32,480
如果约翰・萨拉特有能力
If John Surratt was capable

1311
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,820
置劳埃德先生  路易斯・怀克曼
of putting Mr. Lloyd, Louis Weichmann

1312
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,440
和其他人于险境
and Lord knows how many others at risk,

1313
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,400
谁说他不会对自己的母亲也做一样的事呢
who's to say he didn't do the same to his mother?

1314
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,610
-反对  -停下来
- Objection. - Stop this!

1315
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,680
长官  看起来...  
Sir, it seems the...

1316
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,780
立刻停止  艾金先生
Stop it right now, Mr. Aiken.

1317
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,280
-看起来唯一...-反对
- It seems the only thing... - Objection.

1318
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:43,980
反对  上将  
General, objection.

1319
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,450
也许玛丽・萨拉特唯一的罪过
That Mary Surratt might be guilty of

1320
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,670
就是生了她的儿子约翰  
is having given birth to her son John.

1321
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:48,830
你怎么敢这么说
How dare you?

1322
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:51,860
反对有效  到此为止  艾金先生
Objection sustained. That will be all, Mr. Aiken.

1323
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,130
只是确认一下  劳埃德先生
Just to be clear, Mr. Lloyd,

1324
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,130
在暗杀前几小时
it was the defendant, Mary Surratt,

1325
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:03,340
给你双筒望远镜并交代
who just hours before the assassination

1326
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,800
准备步枪和两瓶威士忌的
brought you field glasses

1327
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,130
就是被告  
and instructed you to prepare rifles

1328
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:09,120
也就是玛丽・萨拉特  是吗
and two bottles of whiskey?

1329
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,140
是的
Yeah.

1330
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,950
谢谢
Thank you.

1331
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:16,450
亨特上将
General Hunter,

1332
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,040
委员们
members of the Commission,

1333
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,830
控方停止对玛丽・萨拉特的辩论
the government rests its case against Mary Surratt.

1334
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:26,500
劳埃德先生  你可以退席了
That'll be all, Mr. Lloyd. You may step down.

1335
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,830
他们给你什么让你扯谎  劳埃德先生
What did they promise you to say that, Mr. Lloyd?

1336
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,050
律师  我警告你
Counselor, I'm warning you.

1337
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,840
估计一箱威士忌也就够了
Bet a case of whiskey's all it took.

1338
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,960
闭嘴  不然我就揍扁你  小子
You best hush up. I'll put you in the ground, boy.

1339
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,050
艾金先生  坐下来  长官
Mr. Aiken, you will sit down, sir.

1340
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,510
让他闭嘴
You shut him up.

1341
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,050
坐下来  长官
Sit down, sir.

1342
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:51,930
现在
Now...

1343
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:54,770
休庭
we will adjourn.

1344
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,520
重新开庭的时候
When we resume,

1345
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,480
辩方可以传唤第一位证人
the defense may call its first witness.

1346
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,200
一  一 
Left. Left.

1347
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,880
抱歉  先生们
Excuse me, sirs.

1348
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,090
你是科廷厄姆上尉吗
Uh, Captain Cottingham?

1349
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,260
是的
Yes.

1350
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,930
能借一步说话吗
Can I have a word with you, please?

1351
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,600
长官
Sir.

1352
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:31,900
你是否询问过约翰・劳埃德
And did you interview John Lloyd,

1353
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,910
那个在萨拉特女士土地上开酒馆的人呢
the man who runs the tavern on Mrs. Surratt's property?

1354
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,560
是的  就在刺杀发生之后
Yes, right after the assassination.

1355
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,430
他是否告诉你萨拉特女士
And did he tell you that Mrs. Surratt

1356
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:43,250
要求步枪和威士忌呢
asked for rifles and whiskey?

1357
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,470
是的  劳埃德说萨拉特女士要求他准备这些东西
Yes. Lloyd said Mrs. Surratt asked him to do all those things.

1358
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,730
你说什么
Uh, excuse me?

1359
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:56,200
我们不是昨天才谈过吗
Did we not talk just yesterday?

1360
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,090
是的
We did.

1361
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,470
你不是说过
And did you not say

1362
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,530
萨拉特女士从未
that Mrs. Surratt never

1363
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:03,550
要求过约翰・劳埃德准备威士忌和步枪吗
asked for whiskey or rifles of John Lloyd?

1364
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,760
我并未否认
I do not deny that.

1365
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,600
但你现在发誓说
And now you're swearing,

1366
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,770
你曾跟我说的一切都是谎言
under oath, that what you told me then was a lie.

1367
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,700
是的  我骗你是因为
Yes. I lied to you 'cause

1368
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,920
我觉得你无权过问
I thought you had no business to ask me.

1369
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,570
无权过问  我
No business? I...

1370
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,120
你是我的证人
You're my witness.

1371
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,480
我难道不该知道真相吗
Should I not expect the truth?

1372
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,020
我站在这里说  我骗了你
I state here that I did lie to you,

1373
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:27,150
但在誓约之下  现在我说的是实话
but under oath, now I'm telling the truth.

1374
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:35,570
霍特先生  你要对证人提问吗
Mr. Holt, do you wish to question the witness?

1375
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:38,810
不  我相信我们所听到的已经足够了
Uh, no. I believe what we've heard is more than sufficient.

1376
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,100
上尉  你可以退席了
Captain, you may step down.

1377
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,390
众所周知  今晚政府
As you know, tonight marks

1378
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:47,620
要为我们的军队举办庆典
Washington's celebration honoring our troops,

1379
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,890
因此休庭
so we will adjourn.

1380
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,840
这还不够  是吗  霍特先生
It's not enough, is it, Mr. Holt?

1381
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,610
你定下了规则   你指定了法官 
It's not enough that you, uh... you set the rules.

1382
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:04,760
这还不够吗
You... You pick the judges.

1383
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,920
现在你又策反了我的证人
Now you have to turn my witness as well.

1384
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,370
被告律师  自重
Counselor, control yourself.

1385
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,820
控方也请自重
Control the prosecution.

1386
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:10,790
艾金先生
Mr. Aiken.

1387
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,520
所有我想要找的证人
Every witness I wish to call has

1388
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,480
不是被关进了监狱就是被此威胁
either been turned by jail or the threat of it.

1389
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,390
够了
That's enough!

1390
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:18,220
控方则是为所欲为  丝毫没有限制
There is no limit to how far the prosecution is willing to go!

1391
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:21,350
被告律师退席  否则视作藐视公堂
Stand down, counselor, or I will hold you in contempt.

1392
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,000
你的行为最好更得体一点
You had better comport yourself in a more appropriate manner,

1393
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,330
不然你会和他们一样被关起来的
or you will find yourself incarcerated with the others.

1394
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,320
晚上好
Good evening.

1395
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:44,900
晚上好  道格拉斯
Good evening, Douglas.

1396
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:45,980
-夫人  -晚上好
- Ma'am. - Good evening.

1397
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:49,810
艾金先生  能借一步说话吗
Mr. Aiken, may I have a word with you?

1398
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,270
当然  失陪一下
Of course. Would you excuse me?

1399
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,950
他第一天上班
His first day on the job.

1400
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:07,740
基于行为不当
弗雷德里克・A・艾金的会员身份即刻被取消

1401
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,080
我很抱歉  艾金先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Aiken.

1402
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,570
这没什么  道格拉斯  不是你的错
It's all right, Douglas. It's not your fault.

1403
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,260
弗雷德里克
Frederick!

1404
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,590
尼克  能陪萨拉上楼吗
Uh, Nick, would you escort Sarah upstairs for me, please?

1405
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,280
当然  不过
Sure, but, uh...

1406
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,910
-一切都还好吗  -一切都好
- Is everything all right? - Everything's fine.

1407
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,720
来吧  萨拉
Come on, Sarah.

1408
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,780
即使只有一条好腿  我也跳得比他好
Even with one good leg, I can still outdance him.

1409
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:29,980
改天吧  尼克
Another night, Nick.

1410
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:36,570
萨拉
Sarah.

1411
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:39,550
萨拉  你去哪
Sarah, where are you going?

1412
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:41,660
"行为不当"
"Conduct unbecoming."

1413
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,210
关于舞会  我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry about the party.

1414
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,190
你以为我在乎什么舞会吗
You think I care about the party?

1415
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:47,050
拜托了  一切都会好起来的  我保证
Please. Everything will be all right. I promise you.

1416
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:48,390
你和那个女人一样
You are just like that woman,

1417
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,960
都准备为了毫无意义的事奔赴刑场
ready to go to the gallows for the most pointless cause.

1418
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,300
在你这么做的时候把所有人都抛下了
People do get left behind when you do that.

1419
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,180
我没办法无视在法庭发生的一切
I can't ignore what's going on in that courtroom.

1420
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,520
但你可以无视我  无视我们
But you can ignore me, us?

1421
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,840
我没这么说  拜托  我必须这么做
I didn't say that. Please, I have to do this.

1422
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,660
是吗
Do you?

1423
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:04,590
你全部心思都在这件危险的事上
I find your devotion to this frightening.

1424
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:08,190
我等了这么长时间
I waited such a long time for you.

1425
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:09,560
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1426
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,320
我知道  但是我现在回来了
I know. But I'm back now.

1427
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,570
你没回来
No, you're not.

1428
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:14,630
我  我...
I am. I... ple...

1429
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:15,700
萨拉  拜托了  你能不能就
Sarah, please, will you just...

1430
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,390
我们得  我们得谈谈
We have to... we have to talk about this.

1431
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:21,070
弗雷德  我爱你  我
Fred, I love you. I...

1432
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:24,050
我希望我能做到  只是  我不能
I wish I could do this. I just... I can't.

1433
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,970
我就是没办法
I just can't.

1434
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,930
等等  至少让我送你回家
Wait. Let me see you home at least.

1435
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,150
等我  好吗
Please wait.

1436
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:39,980
部长先生
Uh, Mr. Secretary.

1437
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,870
我得跟你谈谈
I have to speak with you.

1438
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:44,760
艾金先生  这也许不是什么好时机
Mr. Aiken, perhaps this isn't the best time.

1439
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,550
发生在玛丽・萨拉特身上事是不能容忍的
What is happening to Mary Surratt is an abomination.

1440
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:48,630
退下  上尉
Stand down, Captain.

1441
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:49,550
没事
It's all right.

1442
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:52,030
能陪斯坦顿夫人进去吗
Would you escort Mrs. Stanton in?

1443
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:53,680
我就来
I'll just be a moment.

1444
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,490
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1445
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,290
年轻人
Young man...

1446
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,580
你的勇气总是令人赞赏
always indebted to you for your courage in the field,

1447
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,880
但你必须学会谨言慎行
but you must learn to tread lightly.

1448
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,610
谨言慎行
Tread lightly?

1449
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:04,460
我是不会谨言慎行的
I will not tread lightly.

1450
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,280
你早就认定了她的命运
You have predetermined her fate.

1451
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,100
玛丽・萨拉特的命运完全由委员会决定
Mary Surratt's fate rests entirely with the Commission.

1452
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,450
我关心的是保护我们的联邦
My concern is preserving our Union.

1453
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:13,000
如果我自己的权力都无法得到保障  
Why did I fight for the Union

1454
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,030
又为何要为联邦奋斗呢
if my rights aren't assured?

1455
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:14,840
你来告诉我
You tell me.

1456
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,900
巧言辞令可以召集军队  却不能管理国家
Fine words for rallying the troops, not for running a nation.

1457
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,950
他们暗杀了总统
They assassinated our president,

1458
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,240
必须有人为之责任
and someone must be held accountable.

1459
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,970
人民需要这样
The people want that.

1460
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:26,600
你想要的是约翰・萨拉特  你根本不想要玛丽
It's John Surratt you want. You don't even want Mary.

1461
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,970
有一个我就满足了
I'll settle for either one.

1462
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:30,360
如果你不介意的话  我太太在等我
If you'll excuse me, my wife is waiting.

1463
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,150
蓝天鹅

1464
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,340
艾金先生
Mr. Aiken.

1465
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:27,950
我能进来吗
May I come in?

1466
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,630
-很晚了  -我知道
- It's late. - I know.

1467
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,360
我需要你去作证
I need you to testify.

1468
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,210
很好
Very well.

1469
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:45,310
我会告诉他们我妈是无辜的
I'll tell them my mother's innocent.

1470
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,910
我需要你告诉他们你哥哥有罪
I need you to tell them that your brother is not.

1471
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,180
我不会这么做的
I won't do it.

1472
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,130
如果不这么做  你知道她会怎么样吗
You know what'll happen to her if you don't?

1473
01:21:58,090 --> 01:21:59,170
安娜
Anna...

1474
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,020
你哥哥目前并不需要被拯救
Your brother does not need to be saved right now.

1475
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,130
但你母亲需要
Your mother does.

1476
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,160
艾金先生
Mr. Aiken,

1477
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,600
你还想要传唤别的证人吗
are there any other witnesses you wish to call?

1478
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,840
是的
Uh, yes.

1479
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,400
辩方
The... The defense

1480
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,120
想要传唤安娜・萨拉特小姐
would like to call Miss Anna Surratt.

1481
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,100
亨特上将  这是要
General Hunter, what is...

1482
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,870
请将右手放在圣经上
Place your right hand on this Bible.

1483
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:41,290
我妈在哪
Where's my mother?

1484
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,700
安娜  她就在这
Anna, she's just right here,

1485
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:43,860
在这些人后面
behind these men.

1486
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,340
为什么不让我看到她
Why won't they let me see her?

1487
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,170
我不知道
I don't know.

1488
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:50,080
萨拉特小姐  请
Please, Miss Surratt.

1489
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,810
你是否发誓说出真相  毫无保留
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth

1490
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:59,000
不加掩饰的真相  以此让上帝帮助你?
and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

1491
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:02,730
安娜小姐
Miss Anna.

1492
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,780
我发誓
I do.

1493
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:13,910
不会有事的
It'll be all right.

1494
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,140
萨拉特小姐  你能否告诉我们
Miss Surratt, can you tell us

1495
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,810
你哥哥是什么时候认识
when your brother first became acquainted

1496
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,980
约翰・威尔科斯・布思的
with John Wilkes Booth?

1497
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,920
萨拉特小姐  回答问题
Miss Surratt, you will answer the question.

1498
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,130
我想我哥是一月份认识他的
I believe my brother met him January last.

1499
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:37,920
暗杀前三个月
Three months before the assassination.

1500
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,930
能和这么有名的演员作朋友
He must have been mighty

1501
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,790
他一定很高兴
pleased to have befriended such a famous actor.

1502
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,270
这你得问他了
You'll have to ask him.

1503
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,210
我们都很希望能问他
Well, I'm sure we'd all like to ask him.

1504
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:49,480
你哥哥很自豪地宣称
Your brother proudly called

1505
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,640
自己是布思的朋友  是吗
himself a friend of Booth's, did he not?

1506
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,720
艾金先生  你在做什么
Mr. Aiken, what are you doing?

1507
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,550
妈
Mother!

1508
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:55,860
萨拉特小姐  萨拉特小姐  
Miss Surratt. Miss Surratt, please.

1509
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,020
萨拉特小姐
Miss Surratt.

1510
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,670
我从未
I never...

1511
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:05,030
问过我哥哥和布思的关系怎么样
asked what my brother's relationship was to Booth.

1512
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:07,210
是约翰首先
It was at John's invitation

1513
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,550
邀请他去你家的  是吗
that he first came to your home, was it not?

1514
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:10,930
是的
Yes.

1515
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:20,410
这张布思的照片是你的吗
Does this picture of Booth belong to you?

1516
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:26,060
有天我在画廊发现了这张照片  
I found it in a gallery one day,

1517
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,360
我就买了下来
and I bought it.

1518
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:30,660
自己的朋友如此受重视
Your brother must have been

1519
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,460
你哥哥一定很高兴
pleased that you held his friend in such high regard.

1520
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,170
-不是的  -不是
- No. - No?

1521
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:39,370
他叫我把照片撕了扔掉
No. He told me to tear it up and throw it away.

1522
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,070
为什么
Why?

1523
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:42,120
为什么你哥哥要让你
Why did your brother tell you to destroy

1524
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,290
毁了他朋友  布思的照片呢
a photograph of his friend, Booth?

1525
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,850
别这样  艾金先生
No, Mr. Aiken!

1526
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:47,390
-请回答  -我求你了
- Please. - I beg of you.

1527
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,480
-请回答  -肃静
- Please. - Order!

1528
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,800
萨拉特小姐  请回答
Miss Surratt, please.

1529
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:51,720
回答我的问题
Answer my question.

1530
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:56,290
我觉得他是想保护我们
I suppose he was trying to protect us.

1531
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:59,550
他想要保护你和你母亲?
He was trying to protect you and your mother?

1532
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:00,950
是的
Yes.

1533
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:03,400
为什么他需要保护他的家庭
Why would he need to protect his family?

1534
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,660
安娜  你得作出选择
Anna, you have to choose.

1535
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,250
我觉得
I suppose...

1536
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:21,150
他和布思在计划什么
he and Booth were planning something.

1537
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,370
他在计划什么
He was planning something.

1538
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,880
你知道是什么吗
Did you know what?

1539
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,260
当然不知道
Of course not.

1540
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:31,930
你最后一次见到你哥哥是什么时候
When did you last see your brother?

1541
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,470
他四月初就走了
He left at the beginning of April.

1542
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:37,380
就在暗杀的前几天
Days before the assassination.

1543
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,850
他有没有告诉你他要去哪  
Did he tell you where he was going

1544
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:39,760
或者他在计划什么吗
or what he might be planning?

1545
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,840
他只是说他必须离开
He only said he had to leave.

1546
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:44,660
你和母亲有试图阻止他吗
And did you or your mother try to stop him?

1547
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,440
是的
Yes.

1548
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,780
但我们阻止不了  
But we couldn't.

1549
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:52,200
你们怎么能阻止的了呢  他很愤怒
How could you? He was angry.

1550
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:54,140
他对战争满心沮丧
He was frustrated with the war.

1551
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,520
他痛恨联邦
He hated the Union.

1552
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,640
他愿意做任何事来帮助布思
He would have done anything in his power,

1553
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,610
即使让他的家庭陷入危险
even risk his own family to aid Booth in his cause.

1554
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:02,020
但是  萨拉特小姐
But, Miss Surratt, did

1555
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,710
你母亲有没有和约翰・威尔科斯・布思合谋呢
your mother conspire with John Wilkes Booth?

1556
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:06,460
绝对没有
Absolutely not.

1557
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,760
谢谢
Thank you.

1558
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,690
没有更多问题了
There are no more questions.

1559
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,570
亨特上将  政府能够理解
General Hunter, the government understands

1560
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,510
萨拉特小姐愿意做任何事
why Miss Surratt would be moved

1561
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:23,030
来掩盖她母亲的罪行
to the most extraordinary lengths to conceal her mother's guilt,

1562
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:26,920
包括归罪于她的亲哥哥
including incriminating her own brother.

1563
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,090
我妈是无辜的
My mother is innocent.

1564
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:31,330
萨拉特小姐  你可以离开了
Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.

1565
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:33,500
政府认为不再有必要扣留你
The government no longer deems it necessary to hold you.

1566
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,780
你可以走了
You are free to leave.

1567
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,680
我只想见见我妈
I just want to see my mother.

1568
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,540
求你了  对不起  妈
Please. I'm sorry, mother.

1569
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,970
对不起
I'm sorry.

1570
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:44,110
求你了  求你了  让我见见她
Please. Please, let me see her.

1571
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,520
长官  辩方请求委员会
Sir, the defense would push for the Commission

1572
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,000
让一位母亲见见她的女儿
to show some compassion and allow a mother

1573
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,320
只要一会儿就行
to see her daughter for a brief moment only.

1574
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,180
明天早上再开庭
We will reconvene in the morning.

1575
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:37,980
弗雷德里克  是我
Frederick, it's me.

1576
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:39,500
安娜
Anna.

1577
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:42,010
你在这干吗
What are you doing here?

1578
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:49,210
你从没问过为什么我会有布思的照片
You never asked why I had Booth's photo.

1579
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:54,610
撕了它  把它扔掉
Tear that up and throw it away.

1580
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:57,570
他会让我们都陷入麻烦的  
That man is gonna get us all in trouble,

1581
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:58,490
甚至更糟
if not worse.

1582
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:07,440
我应该把它扔掉
I should have thrown it away,

1583
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,040
但是我没有
but I didn't.

1584
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:21,240
你迷恋上布思了
So you were infatuated with Booth.

1585
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:25,810
我发誓我不知道他会做什么
I swear I didn't know what he was capable of.

1586
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,330
我相信你  但是你哥哥知道
I believe you. But your brother did.

1587
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:33,300
没有我哥哥你能救我妈吗
Can you save my mother without him?

1588
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,680
能吗  弗雷德里克
Can you, Frederick?

1589
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,800
大概不行
Probably not.

1590
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,530
沃尔特神父
Father Walter!

1591
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,820
神父
Father?

1592
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,990
能失陪一下吗
Will you excuse us for a minute?

1593
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,120
律师
Counselor.

1594
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,140
我现在就要见约翰・萨拉特
I need to see John Surratt right away.

1595
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,780
安娜・萨拉特让我来的
Anna Surratt sent me.

1596
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:08,440
就像我告诉萨拉特小姐的一样  
Well, as I told Miss Surratt,

1597
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,420
我只能传递消息
I can only pass along a message.

1598
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,670
他在哪
Where is he?

1599
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,170
我不知道
I don't know.

1600
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,030
只有教堂的人
Only that some in the

1601
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:17,010
能给他提供避难所
church have chosen to provide him sanctuary.

1602
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:19,300
看来他们的选择并没有让你陷入麻烦
You don't seem troubled by their choice.

1603
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,860
你因为这个就送他去绞刑架吗
You prefer he be crucified by this mob?

1604
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,980
可他也不是什么好人
John is hardly the Prince of Peace.

1605
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,330
他因为谋杀与叛国罪正被通缉
He's wanted for murder and treason.

1606
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,930
窝藏罪犯不仅不道德  神父  而且非法
Harboring him is not only immoral, Father, it's illegal.

1607
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:34,150
我的法在这儿  律师  我只听上帝的
Our laws are written here, counselor, our allegiance to God.

1608
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,650
恕我直言  神父
You forgive me, Father,

1609
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:36,900
你讲的都是废话
but that's a bunch of cock and bull.

1610
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:40,260
人们对圣经的看法各有不同
Bible bears as many interpretations as anything else.

1611
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,480
你有什么口信要我转达的
Is there a message you wish me to pass along?

1612
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:45,250
我的案子明天结案
My case summary is tomorrow,

1613
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:49,250
所以你告诉约翰・萨拉特  除非他自首
so you tell John Surratt that unless he surrenders himself,

1614
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,910
否则他母亲将因为他犯的罪而受惩罚
his mother will most likely be punished for his crimes.

1615
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:57,910
艾金先生
Mr. Aiken.

1616
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:13,190
律师也好  士兵也好
For the lawyer as well as the soldier,

1617
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,220
都有一种急迫的使命感
there is an equally imperative command.

1618
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:21,170
我们有义务去为无辜者伸张正义
That duty is to shelter from injustice the innocent,

1619
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:24,440
去保护弱者反抗压迫
to protect the weak from oppression

1620
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:26,750
必要时
and, when necessity demands,

1621
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,300
为那些冤民鼓舞打气
to rally to the defense of those being wronged.

1622
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,050
在经历了我国历史上
After the most thorough

1623
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:37,830
最完整的一次调查之后
investigation in our nation's history,

1624
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:40,470
政府对玛丽・萨拉特的指控
the government's entire case against Mary Surratt

1625
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,910
基于三点
rests on three acts...

1626
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,430
一  她与布思的相识
one, her acquaintance with Booth,

1627
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,450
二  她对劳埃德作的指示
two, her alleged instructions to Lloyd,

1628
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:50,570
三  否认与佩恩相识
and, three, her nonrecognition of Payne.

1629
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:54,820
就是这三点构成了
It is these three acts that constitute the sum total

1630
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,700
玛丽・萨拉特
of Mary Surratt's part

1631
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,950
参与叛国与谋杀的罪状
in this traitorous and murderous conspiracy.

1632
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,210
他们认为自己是无辜的
By themselves, they constitute no crime.

1633
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,660
你和我也许做过同样的事情
Any one of you or I might have done the same,

1634
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:10,760
但是政府坚持认为她用心险恶
but the government insists she did them with evil intent,

1635
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,450
大部分基于约翰・劳埃德与
largely based on the testimony of two men,

1636
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,490
路易斯・怀克曼的证词
John Lloyd and Louis Weichmann.

1637
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,010
到现在为止  最好的可能是
Yet, at best, the actions

1638
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,320
这些人出尔反尔
of these men undermine their credibility,

1639
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:23,930
最坏的可能是  他们干了见不得人的勾当
and, at worst, they have done the unspeakable...

1640
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:25,820
他们为了洗脱罪名
they have gained their freedom

1641
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:29,010
而去撒谎诬陷别人
by falsely accusing another of their crime.

1642
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:33,870
我们相信玛丽・萨拉特今天在这里
There can be no doubt as to the principal and real reason

1643
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:35,830
有她自己真正的原因
that Mary Surratt is here today.

1644
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:38,150
就是她的儿子  约翰・萨拉特
It's because of her son, John Surratt.

1645
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,130
是他请布思去他家的  不是她
He invited Booth into her home. She did not.

1646
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:46,310
是他把枪和弹药藏在劳埃德的酒馆里
And he hid rifles and ammunition in Lloyd's Tavern.

1647
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:47,040
不是她
She did not.

1648
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,920
如果约翰・萨拉特是个共犯
If John Surratt was part of this conspiracy,

1649
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,690
我祈求上帝
I pray to God that he receives

1650
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:52,840
用各种方法惩罚他
every punishment known to man,

1651
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:56,050
而如果他母亲因为不足的证据
but if his mother can be convicted

1652
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,680
被判有罪的话
on such insufficient evidence,

1653
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,550
你们会有报应的
I tell you none of you are safe.

1654
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:03,810
各位庭审法官们
Members of the Commission,

1655
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,590
请还玛丽・萨拉特一个公道
do not permit this injustice to Mary Surratt

1656
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:11,740
而不是出于报复而牺牲我们的天赋人权
by sacrificing our sacred rights out of revenge.

1657
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:16,060
为了捍卫它们而倒下的人已经太多了
Too many of us have laid down our lives to preserve them.

1658
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:29,140
先生们
Gentlemen.

1659
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:40,080
我们敬爱的总统被一颗子弹就夺走了生命
One bullet may have killed our beloved president.

1660
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:45,710
一颗子弹  但不是一个人干的
One bullet, but not one man.

1661
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:56,150
过来坐
Sit with me.

1662
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,740
有什么消息吗
Is there any word?

1663
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:11,690
没有  他们还在审议
No. They're still deliberating.

1664
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:14,240
我是说我儿子
I mean about my son.

1665
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,390
我把他管得太紧了
I held him too close.

1666
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:25,570
我不想约翰变成他父亲那样
I didn't want John turning out like his father,

1667
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:26,760
所以我看着他
so I kept him near.

1668
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:32,960
战争爆发时  他想参军
And when the war broke out, he wanted to enlist,

1669
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,820
我没让他去
but I wouldn't let him.

1670
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,930
我儿子只想冲破牢笼
My son just needed to break free...

1671
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,160
做一回自己
be his own man.

1672
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:51,010
就用了这样的方式
And this is the way he did it.

1673
01:33:58,030 --> 01:33:59,860
都赞成吗
All those in favor?

1674
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:01,690
赞成
Aye.

1675
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:06,940
好  我们都同意了
Well, then, we are all agreed

1676
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,650
被判死刑的犯人是
on the penalty of death for the prisoners

1677
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:12,640
赫罗尔德・阿泽特和佩恩
Herold, Atzerodt and Payne.

1678
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,130
那女人呢
What about the woman?

1679
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,140
关于玛丽・萨拉特
Regarding Mary Surratt,

1680
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,020
都赞成吗  先生们
all those in favor, gentlemen?

1681
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:45,130
不行
No.

1682
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
该死
Damn it!

1683
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,300
不行
No.

1684
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,830
她必须要接受惩罚
No, she must be punished to the full extent.

1685
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:57,030
我要这些人立刻消声灭迹
I want these people buried and forgotten.

1686
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,610
大多数人倾向于一个比较宽容的判决
The majority prefer a more merciful sentence,

1687
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:06,310
基于她年龄  性别的无期徒刑
life in prison on account of her age, gender.

1688
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,150
艾金先生很能干
I give Mr. Aiken credit.

1689
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:10,820
他知道怎么利用她女儿
He knew just how to use the daughter.

1690
01:35:11,470 --> 01:35:12,890
没错
It seems so.

1691
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,780
你向委员会传达了我的意思了吗
You made my sentiments known to the Commission?

1692
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:18,480
判决已经定了
Their minds are made.

1693
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:25,280
那我们改变他们
Then let us change them.

1694
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,390
在对证据的反复考量之后
After mature consideration of the evidence,

1695
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,530
本委员会判你  玛丽・E・苏拉特
Commission finds you, Mary E. Surratt,

1696
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:45,480
有罪
Guilty...

1697
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:48,380
企图谋杀亚伯拉罕・林肯总统
Guilty of conspiring to kill and murder

1698
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,390
之罪名成立
President Abraham Lincoln,

1699
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:54,970
企图谋杀美国副总统安德鲁・约翰逊
Guilty of conspiring to kill and murder

1700
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:55,980
之罪名成立
andrew Johnson, vice president of the United States,

1701
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,170
企图谋杀美国国务卿威廉・H・苏厄德
Guilty of conspiring to kill and murder

1702
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,840
之罪名成立
William H. Seward, secretary of State.

1703
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,830
本委员会由此宣判你
The Commission does therefore sentence you

1704
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,870
处以绞刑
to be hanged by the neck until you be dead.

1705
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,600
玛丽・萨拉特死期已到
Mary Surratt to meet her doom!

1706
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:26,640
四名刺客午时处死
Four assassins die tomorrow at noon!

1707
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:27,580
给你  先生
Here you go, sir.

1708
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,640
玛丽・萨拉特死期已到
Mary Surratt to meet her doom!

1709
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,530
四名刺客午时处死
Four assassins die tomorrow at noon!

1710
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:48,450
萨拉特先生  给  先生
Mr. Surratt. Here, sir.

1711
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,490
一定还有办法救她
There must be something we can do.

1712
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,300
你有三个选择
You have three options:

1713
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,690
请求总统暂缓行刑
Petition the president for a stay of execution...

1714
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:16,680
但是  他不会那么做
but, uh, he won't do that,

1715
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:17,930
因为如果他做了
because if he did,

1716
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:19,790
人们会认为 他也是个共犯
people would think he was part of the conspiracy.

1717
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:22,780
第二  申请个书面人身保护令
Uh, two, apply for a writ of habeas corpus

1718
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:24,330
带她去民事法庭
to retry her in a civilian court,

1719
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:26,290
但是没有哪个法官愿意得罪斯坦顿
but no judge would oppose Stanton

1720
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:28,620
或者陆军部的人
or the might of the War Department.

1721
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:32,330
还有  第三  约翰・萨拉特
Uh, and, three, John Surratt

1722
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:35,130
在明天中午之前自首
shows himself before noon tomorrow.

1723
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:36,960
你要出差吗
Are you going somewhere?

1724
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:39,220
我在巴尔的摩有笔生意
I have business in Baltimore.

1725
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:40,260
什么
What?

1726
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,260
你现在可不能走
You... You can't leave now!

1727
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,260
都结束了
It's over.

1728
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:51,810
弗雷迪  她不是你的母亲
Freddie, she's not your mother.

1729
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:55,610
如果约翰・萨拉特都不想救他妈
If John Surratt won't give himself up for her,

1730
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,320
你为什么要救呢
then why should you?

1731
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:06,030
弗雷迪
Freddie!

1732
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,260
弗雷德里克・塞巴斯蒂安・艾金
Frederick Sebastian Aiken,

1733
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:08,950
我们知道你在
we know you're in there!

1734
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,540
快开门  快
Open the door now. Come on.

1735
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,880
弗雷德  你在啊
Fred... ah, there he is.

1736
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,170
如果你还不想隐居  艾金
Well, if it isn't the reclusive Master Aiken.

1737
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:19,340
我们还可以喝一杯
We thought you could use this.

1738
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:22,510
汉密尔顿  你对奥林法官了解多少
Hamilton, how well do you know Judge Olin?

1739
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,600
干什么
What are you doing?

1740
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,470
你认为他会给我签人身保护令吗
You think he'll give me a writ of habeas corpus?

1741
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:27,850
你不能这样做
You can't pursue a writ.

1742
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:29,430
他们不让我上诉
They won't allow me to appeal this verdict,

1743
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:30,980
那我就申请一个新法庭
so I'm gonna appeal for a new trial.

1744
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,560
如果你这样做  是在羞辱斯坦顿
If you do this, you will humiliate Stanton,

1745
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,020
然后他会毁了你
and he will destroy you.

1746
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:35,520
让斯坦顿见鬼去吧
The hell with Stanton.

1747
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:38,440
你为什么  为什么坚持帮她
Why do you... Why do you insist on standing by her?

1748
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,240
喂喂  根本没有用
Hey. Hey, it makes no sense.

1749
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:42,910
他们那样对她是不对的
What they're doing to her is wrong.

1750
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:45,490
如果那样对待约翰・威尔科斯・布思
If John Wilkes Booth himself was tried in the same manner,

1751
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:47,870
也是不对的
it would still be wrong.

1752
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:52,410
汉密尔顿  她离上绞刑架不到12小时了
Hamilton, she's to hang in less than 12 hours.

1753
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,130
奥林法官出城了
Judge Olin's out of town.

1754
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:56,790
他会是我的第一选择
He would have been my first choice.

1755
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,960
怀力怎么样
What about Wylie?

1756
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,380
也许吧
Maybe Wylie.

1757
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:02,340
他  他一直被认为是个自由思想者
He's, uh- -he's always been known as a Free Thinker.

1758
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:03,850
是啊  这么多年老练世故
Yes. He's been around for ages,

1759
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:05,470
但是他跟林肯交情最深
but he was the closest to Lincoln.

1760
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:06,390
那卡特怎么样
Then what about Carter?

1761
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:07,690
没门儿  刺杀那晚
Not a chance. He was with

1762
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:09,810
他跟斯坦顿在一起
Stanton on the night of the assassination.

1763
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:11,770
再说  他们每周聚一次会餐
Besides, they have dinner together once a week.

1764
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:14,060
那你意思是怀力是我的最佳选择
Then you're saying that Wylie is my best option.

1765
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,650
不是  你的最佳选择是别再发疯了
No. Your best option is to stop this nonsense

1766
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:18,360
陪我们喝光这瓶酒
and help us empty this bottle.

1767
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,070
最好听他的话
Better listen to the man.

1768
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,920
怀力法官吗
Judge Wylie?

1769
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:41,090
我  我需要申请一张人身保护令
I, uh... I need to apply for a writ of habeas corpus.

1770
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,590
在这个时候
At this hour of the night?

1771
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:45,050
抱歉  先生  实在等不了了
I'm sorry, sir. It can't wait.

1772
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:47,390
那就要把一个老人吵醒吗
Interrupting an old man's sleep?

1773
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:50,560
我想你走错门了  小伙子
I'd say you're getting off on the wrong foot, son.

1774
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,890
是玛丽・萨拉特的案子
It's for Mary Surratt.

1775
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,280
重新开庭
A new trial...

1776
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:11,030
一个由她同辈的陪审团组成的民事法庭
in a civil court by a jury of her peers.

1777
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,580
那就是你的目的吗  艾金先生
Is that what you want, Mr. Aiken?

1778
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,080
是  求您了  法官大人
Yes, please, Your Honor.

1779
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:18,040
所以我们能再次经历一次总统被刺的过程
So we can relive our president's assassination all over again.

1780
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,000
那可不是我的本意
That's not my intention.

1781
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,670
那你的本意是什么
Then to what intent?

1782
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:24,550
也许结果会不一样吗
Might this not result in exactly the same thing?

1783
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:26,190
也许吧  但是结果
Perhaps, but results

1784
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:28,590
不应该成为评判公义的标尺
should not be our only measure of justice.

1785
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,100
你在教训我不懂什么是公义吗
Are you going to lecture me on justice?

1786
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,140
不敢  先生
Sorry, sir.

1787
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:36,730
你知道我是被林肯总统亲自任命的
You realize that I was personally appointed by President Lincoln.

1788
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:37,770
是
Yes.

1789
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:40,150
那你还来找我
And yet you still come to me.

1790
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:43,400
恕我直言  法官大人
Forgive me, Your Honor,

1791
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:48,030
我们不是在任何时候都有义务去坚持法理
but are we not obligated to follow the law at all times,

1792
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:49,660
而忽略情理吗
regardless of our emotions?

1793
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,740
这个不是你一时冲动吗
And is this not driven by emotions?

1794
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:52,870
难道不是吗
Isn't that what this is all about?

1795
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:54,620
这是为了不冤枉好人
It's about preventing injustice.

1796
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:57,870
我知道人们还是愤愤不平
Now, I know that the people are still angry.

1797
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,500
对  没错  我也是
Yes, they are, and so am I.

1798
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:02,350
可我希望  我坚信林肯总统
But I hope, I trust that President Lincoln

1799
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,470
任命你是因为你手上握着神圣的宪法
appointed you because you hold the Constitution sacred.

1800
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:09,720
不管你相信玛丽・萨拉特有罪还是无辜的
Whether you believe Mary Surratt is guilty or innocent,

1801
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,260
宪法的宗旨就在于
the Constitution was intended...

1802
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:12,890
现在你又要给我上宪法课了
And now you're gonna lecture me on the Constitution.

1803
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:14,240
无论在战时或和平时期
...to protect the rights

1804
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,680
他会保护所有公民的所有权利不受侵犯
of all citizens at all times in peace or war.

1805
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:18,310
再过几个小时
And in a matter of hours,

1806
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:21,860
宪法将被践踏  除非你在那上面签字
it will have failed to protect her unless you sign that writ.

1807
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,650
你确信她是无辜的吗
You believe she's innocent?

1808
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:28,400
我不知道
I don't know.

1809
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:30,640
但是如果得不到一个公平审判
But if we don't get a proper trial,

1810
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,320
我们永远不会知道
we never will.

1811
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,660
你不能进去  喂
You can't go in there! Wait!

1812
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,830
真抱歉  部长先生  我拦不住他
I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary. I tried to stop him.

1813
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,000
没事
It's all right.

1814
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:57,970
早上好  约瑟夫
Good morning, Joseph.

1815
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,060
早上好
Good morning.

1816
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:00,340
看来艾金先生
It appears that Mr. Aiken

1817
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:03,480
要了一张怀力法官签名的保护令
has procured a writ signed by Judge Wylie.

1818
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,690
再见
Good day.

1819
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:07,530
等一下  上尉
Before you go, Captain,

1820
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,360
告诉我
tell me...

1821
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:13,700
当你第一次听说我们的国务卿
when you first learned that our secretary of State

1822
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:15,240
被搞得焦头烂额
had been butchered to within an inch of his life

1823
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,470
他们把一粒子弹
and that they put a bullet

1824
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:18,330
送进了我们总统的脑袋
in the back of our president's head,

1825
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:20,000
让这个城市混乱不堪时
when this city was in chaos,

1826
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,810
你难道不希望看到秩序得到恢复
did you not wish to see order restored

1827
01:42:21,810 --> 01:42:23,670
正义得到伸张吗
and justice served,

1828
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:26,120
或许你只关心那些
or were you just concerned with

1829
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,130
刺客的权利
the rights of the assassins?

1830
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:31,050
你关心的不是正义  而是报复
It's not justice you're after. It's revenge.

1831
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:35,680
我不会出于复仇而如此低声下气
I would never go to such lengths out of vengeance,

1832
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:38,940
但是为了这个国家的生存
but to ensure the survival of this nation,

1833
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:40,850
我会不择手段
I would do anything.

1834
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:44,640
玛丽・萨拉特是有史以来
Mary Surratt was a party to the most

1835
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,820
最让人痛心的犯罪党羽
grievous crime in our history.

1836
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:50,550
必要时我们会给她一个迅速
Necessity demands that she be given a swift,

1837
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,570
绝对  残酷的判决
sure and harsh sentence.

1838
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:56,870
我一样坚信我们的天赋人权  律师
I, too, hold sacred our rights, counselor,

1839
01:42:56,910 --> 01:43:00,280
但是如果我们的国家不在了
but they count not at all

1840
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,250
说什么都是屁话
if our nation ceases to exist.

1841
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,130
请在中午之前
Please see to it that Mary Surratt

1842
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:07,730
确保玛丽・萨拉特
is delivered to Judge Wylie's courtroom

1843
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:08,460
准时到庭
no later than noon...

1844
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:09,590
再见
sir.

1845
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,770
快走  停下
Let's go. Come on. Stay there.

1846
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,950
你得再次上庭
You will have to stand trial again,

1847
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:37,740
但是这次是民事法庭
but it will be a civilian trial.

1848
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:39,030
民事法庭没有将军参加吧
And a civilian trial has no generals.

1849
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,410
对  没有将军参加
That's correct. No generals.

1850
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,830
祝福你  孩子
Bless you, son.

1851
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:45,370
祝福你
Bless you.

1852
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,090
妈
Oh, Mama.

1853
01:43:51,130 --> 01:43:52,130
安娜
Anna.

1854
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,220
应该三架才对
Should only be three.

1855
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:05,850
到点了  夫人
It's time, ma'am.

1856
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:08,360
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

1857
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,110
我们需要把她带走
We need to prepare her with the others.

1858
01:44:10,150 --> 01:44:13,650
不不  她已经转为重新上庭了
No. No, she is to be transferred to Judge Wylie's court.

1859
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:15,990
我建议让这位小姐保持镇定
I advise sedating the young lady.

1860
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:17,770
-你们别想这么做  -安娜
- You'll do no such thing. - Anna.

1861
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:21,410
根据我的人身保护令  她的案子要重审
I have procured a writ that says she is to get a new trial.

1862
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,040
总统刚刚取消了你的保护令
President just suspended your writ.

1863
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,420
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1864
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:35,220
她必须要走了
She's to hang with the others.

1865
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:36,260
不
No.

1866
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:38,390
不  弗雷德里克  想想办法啊
No. Frederick, do something.

1867
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:42,390
我
I...

1868
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:44,560
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1869
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,060
不  不
Oh, no.

1870
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,560
不不不
No. No, no, no, no.

1871
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,900
不  妈  别走  妈
No, Mama. No. No, Mama. No.

1872
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:50,400
我永远在你身边
I'll always be with you.

1873
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:53,530
不不不  妈
No! No! Oh, Mama, no!

1874
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:55,820
我爱你  安娜  我爱你
I love you, Anna. I love you.

1875
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:57,240
不
No!

1876
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,360
天啊  不
Oh, God, no!

1877
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:02,870
妈
Mama!

1878
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:26,390
拉丁语

1879
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:31,310
战时无法律
In times of war, the law falls silent.

1880
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:33,570
扯淡
It shouldn't.

1881
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:40,290
这个词是最后一位南军上将
Word is the last Confederate general

1882
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:42,410
向联邦军投降时说的
surrendered to Union troops.

1883
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:43,740
和平
Peace.

1884
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,240
终于和平了
Peace at last.

1885
01:47:57,710 --> 01:47:59,540
我奉命来这里
I am hereby commanded

1886
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:01,380
执行戴维・E・赫罗尔德
to cause David E. Herold,

1887
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:03,170
G・A・阿泽特
G. A. Atzerodt,

1888
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,920
刘易斯・佩恩
Lewis Payne

1889
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:07,890
和玛丽・E・苏拉特
and Mary E. Surratt

1890
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:10,350
的死刑
to be executed

1891
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:11,490
根据美国总统
in accordance with the

1892
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:13,680
安德鲁・约翰逊
order of the president of the United States,

1893
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:15,020
的命令
Andrew Johnson.

1894
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,950
万能的主保佑你
The Almighty God bless you.

1895
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:10,200
罪犯起立
Stand your prisoners up.

1896
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:14,830
双手反绑
Step them to the noose.

1897
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:59,460
16个月之后

1898
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,640
好的  先生  我带你去
Okay, sir. I'll show you where he's at...

1899
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,060
不用  我认识路
No, I know the way.

1900
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:25,540
艾金先生
Mr. Aiken.

1901
01:51:27,210 --> 01:51:28,960
我没想到你会来
I didn't think you'd come.

1902
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,510
不知道我能帮你什么忙
I don't know what help I can be to you.

1903
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:33,930
我已经不当律师了
I've left the law.

1904
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,800
我只想谢谢你
I just wanted to thank you

1905
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,350
对我妈那么好
for the kindness that you showed my mother.

1906
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,520
相信我  艾金先生
Believe me, Mr. Aiken,

1907
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,560
我还以为他们不会杀她
I never thought they'd kill her.

1908
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:57,280
沃尔特神父叫我给你这个
Father Walter asked that I give you these.

1909
01:51:58,450 --> 01:52:00,200
你母亲的遗物
They were your mother's.

1910
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:05,830
我希望它们能给你安慰
I hope they can be of some comfort to you.

1911
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:09,250
它们是你的了
They belong to you.

1912
01:52:11,420 --> 01:52:13,760
你比我更有资格做她的儿子
You were more of a son to her than I ever was.

1913
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:25,390
请开门
Thank you.

1914
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:10,410
一年之后
高级法院毫无争议地规定
公民享有由陪审团旁听的权利
甚至是在战争时期

1915
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:20,740
由北方与南方组成的陪审团
对约翰・萨拉特的裁决争执不下

1916
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:28,560
他最终被无罪释放

1917
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:37,850
弗雷德里克・艾金离开法律界之后
在新开张的华盛顿邮报当上了首个新闻主编
