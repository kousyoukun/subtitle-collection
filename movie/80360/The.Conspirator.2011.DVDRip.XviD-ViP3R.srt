1
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
Two men standing at the Pearly Gates.

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,400
The first man says,
"How'd you die?"

3
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,360
Second says,
"I froze to death.

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,440
How 'bout you?"

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,440
And the, uh, second man says,

6
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,680
"Well, I thought my... my wife
was being unfaithful to me,

7
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,320
- so I ran all the way home."
- Come on.

8
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,840
"And burst into the bedroom."

9
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,840
There's nothin' here.

10
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,840
- "She just..."
- Look over there.

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,840
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,680
Make sure there's men on...

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,200
Here!

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,640
We're here!

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,480
You take him first.

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,720
But, captain, he's as good as...

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,040
That's an order.

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,200
Sergeant.

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,680
Hey, watch it. Careful. Corporal!

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,960
Watch his leg.

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,360
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,280
Victory!

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,640
Getting a little ahead of ourselves,
don't you think?

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Will, Lee surrendered to Grant,
so have a drink.

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,640
- Freddie, have you seen him yet?
- A dozen rebel armies still in the field.

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
I'd say peace is far from in hand.

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
Hamilton, you could put frost on a fire.

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,840
No, I haven't, but half his cabinet's here.
There's Interior...

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,760
and Postmaster.

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Treasury.

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,440
Secretary of Navy.

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,080
Where's War?

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,520
Ooh, there he is.

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,640
God, what I would give to meet him.

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
What? Wait.
Where are you going?

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,280
You coming or not?

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,760
Are you... Are you mad?

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,920
You can't approach Edwin Stanton
without an introduction.

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,160
Really?

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,840
Frederick Aiken.

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,280
I've been to Creation and back
lookin' for you.

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,360
Senator.
Uh, Baker, Hamilton,

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,640
allow me to introduce the distinguished
senator from Maryland,

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,880
- Mr. Reverdy Johnson.
- Great honor, senator.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,040
Gentlemen, you've done this nation proud.

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,320
Thank you, sir.

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,320
Ladies. Ladies, may I present
two genuine war heroes.

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
Now you all get acquainted

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,840
while I introduce the counselor
to some of my,

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,480
uh, esteemed associates.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,480
- Ladies.
- Hello.

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,640
It's, uh, quite a turnout.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,560
- Hello.
- It's an honor to meet the lovely...

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,240
Victory is like shit to flies, Freddie.

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Why, Ed, what a delightful surprise.

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,920
Life's full of them, Reverdy.

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,480
This is our War secretary,
Mr. Edwin Stanton.

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,440
Yeah. It's a... it's a very great
pleasure, sir.

59
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,920
Mr. Aiken had two horses
shot from under him

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,320
and never quit the field.

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,120
Could use a loyal man like you
over at the War Department, Captain.

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,080
Sir.

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,920
Captain's back to bein' a lawyer.

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,880
Time to heal the nation, Ed,
not wage more war.

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,360
Pleasure as always, Senator.

66
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,800
- Captain.
- Sir.

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm sorry you won't be able to meet
the president this evening.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,720
Will he not be attending?

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,920
It seems Mrs. Lincoln
prefers an evening of theater

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,280
to a room full of soldiers.

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Anything. I can play anything.

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,440
Poor Blind Boy?

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,760
I don't know that one.
Uh, anything...

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh, thank you, Nicholas.

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,280
Sarah... oh, my God.
You look beautiful.

76
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,760
Sarah, glad to see you.

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,840
Fred didn't mention you'd be
joining us this evening.

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
- That sounds like Fred.
- What sounds like Fred?

79
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Nothing you need to worry about.

80
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,400
How many bottles is that now, Nick?

81
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,040
Uh, nothing you need
to worry about, Fred.

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,440
Shall we take a stroll?

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
It's good to have you boys back.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
It's good to be back.

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,840
It's very good to be back.

86
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,800
Oh, quite right.

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,000
Some gals and their mothers
would look...

88
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,440
Mr. Vice President.

89
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,440
Yes, Senator?

90
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,
but I need your authorization on this.

91
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,480
Is it really necessary right now?
I have so many guests.

92
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm afraid it's relatively urgent.

93
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,960
You have to keep the sun
out of your eyes,

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,960
look straight, pull strong,

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
calculate the distance,

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,080
and you'll hit the mark every time.

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,960
- What?
- Not sure.

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,880
Sir?

99
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,960
Yes, I have a package
for Secretary Seward.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,160
We are old friends, Mr. Trenchard,

101
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,120
and you needn't be afraid of us.

102
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,520
I ain't afraid of you,

103
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,760
both of you together.

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Want another?

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Sir?

106
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,560
Secretary Stanton is a smart man.

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,200
The War Department
would be lucky to have you.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,760
It was an honor to meet the man, but...

109
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,400
I'm eager to put the war behind me.

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,160
You do look awfully handsome
in your uniform.

111
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,240
I suppose I'm going
to have to get used to you

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,400
in civilian clothing again.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,280
So you did miss me?

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
On occasion.

115
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,080
Now I've no fortune,

116
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,320
but I am filled over with affection

117
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,880
that I am ready to pour over you

118
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,360
like apple sass over roasted pork.

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,320
Mr. Trenchard!

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,000
You are addressing my daughter,
and in my presence!

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,480
Yes! I'm offering her my heart
and my hand just as she wants them,

122
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,840
with nothing in 'em.

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,080
Now, I'm aware, Mr. Trenchard,

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
that you are not used
to the manner of polite...

125
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,320
Pardon me. I'm sor...

126
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Oh.

127
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,640
Shit.

128
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
- Oh, no!
- Hold it!

129
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,880
Stop! No!

130
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,320
No, please! Don't!

131
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,200
Ohh! Unh!

132
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,880
Help!

133
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,560
Somebody help!

134
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,320
Help!

135
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,080
...to which you have fallen guilty.

136
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,800
Well, I guess I know enough
to turn you inside out, old gal,

137
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,880
you sockdologizing old man-trap...

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,560
Ohh!

139
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,600
Sic semper tyrannis!

140
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
The South is avenged!

141
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
He's getting away!

142
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,760
Stop him!

143
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,360
Come on.

144
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,920
Come here, you son of a bitch!

145
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,480
Can't get... let you out of here!

146
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
What is it?

147
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,920
- Major?
- What's happened?

148
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,920
Lincoln's been shot.

149
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
- What?
- He's been shot.

150
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
You stay here.

151
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,000
Open the door.

152
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,400
Sergeant.

153
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
Stand aside.

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,360
Over there.

155
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
Across the street.

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,960
Make way!

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,520
Please, stand aside.

158
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,680
Please.

159
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
Move back! Please!

160
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,360
- Coming through.
- Clear the way!

161
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,880
Back! Stand aside!

162
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,960
Can you see anything?

163
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,800
Open the door!

164
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Try the other door.

165
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,040
Find another way!

166
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,360
Stand aside.

167
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,080
Over here!

168
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,560
Come on inside!

169
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,760
Back here. Back here.

170
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,120
Set him down easy.

171
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,480
Where's the doctor?

172
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,680
Get some towels.

173
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,080
Mr. Secretary, wait, sir.

174
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
No. I want to see him.

175
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,760
Make way!

176
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,560
Out of my way!

177
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
Move aside!

178
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,120
Out! Move!

179
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,640
- Where is he?
- He's down there, sir.

180
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,720
There, sir.

181
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Take his pulse.

183
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,600
Mr. Secretary, it was the actor,
John Wilkes Booth.

184
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,040
Are you certain?

185
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,800
They've performed with him many times.
They're positive.

186
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
We haven't done anything wrong.
It's gonna be all right.

187
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,560
Well, one man did not orchestrate
all of this on his own.

188
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,560
Where's Grant?

189
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
He's on a train to Philadelphia.

190
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,280
Bring him to me.

191
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,440
I want the commander
of the Union army here.

192
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,440
- Move.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
Put the forts on alert, all guns manned.

194
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,200
And find out which members of the Cabinet
are still unaccounted for.

195
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,280
Sir, we should move to the War Department
to facilitate operations.

196
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,320
- I'm not leaving him.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,400
Damn the rebels.

198
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Damn them all to hell.

199
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Mr. Secretary, sir.

200
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,960
Several names have come up, sir,

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,320
including an intimate of Booth's,

202
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,320
a John Surratt.

203
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,640
What is known of him?

204
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,000
21 years old, lives here.

205
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
His mother runs
a boarding house in town.

206
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,040
Find him.

207
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,480
I want the city closed.

208
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,760
If any of these assassins

209
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,480
get south of the Potomac
or up into Canada,

210
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,600
they will never be found.

211
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
Right away, sir.

212
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Also the vice president wishes
to pay his respects.

213
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,520
When I say it is safe
for him to do so.

214
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,120
And keep him away
from the liquor.

215
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,120
Yes, sir.

216
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,400
Take that woman out,
and do not let her in again.

217
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,360
Let's go.

218
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,360
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

219
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Move it!

220
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,200
Get up, you!

221
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,600
No!

222
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Booth.

223
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,680
That's for the judge to decide.

224
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,360
Sir.

225
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,920
Well, nice of you
to show, Mr. Aiken.

226
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,840
I'm sorry for being late, Senator.

227
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,040
You aware the trial of the conspirators
begins today?

228
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,920
Yes, sir.
There's not a seat to be had.

229
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,760
Well, now you have one.

230
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,400
How's that, sir?

231
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,880
I've taken one of the cases,

232
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,120
and I want you
to be my second chair.

233
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,000
I thought the government
was planning a military tribunal.

234
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,600
Oh, indeed. Stanton has chosen

235
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,080
nine of his most loyal officers
to be judges, all for Union.

236
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
In fact, he's picked one of Lincoln's pallbearers
to head the Commission.

237
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,560
Uh, let's go.

238
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,840
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.

239
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,800
I might be being a little slow,

240
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,240
but won't the War Department

241
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,600
be handling the prosecution?

242
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,720
Stanton's most trusted
judge advocate general,

243
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,640
Joseph Holt, will be in charge.

244
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,280
Then what are we to do?

245
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,160
Defend one of the eight.

246
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,360
Defend one of the assassins?

247
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,920
Alleged assassins, counselor.

248
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,320
I had a letter from the lady this morning.

249
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,400
She runs a boarding house,
a Mrs. Mary...

250
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,400
Surratt?

251
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,480
Yes, that's it.

252
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,400
Sir, her son John was Booth's right hand.

253
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,520
Well, if they suspect her son,
they should try him.

254
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,800
[Laughs] They would
if they could find him,

255
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,360
but they've got 250 agents
out looking for him.

256
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
She built the nest
that hatched this plot.

257
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,600
President Johnson said it himself.

258
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,320
Well, I know this goes hard
with you, Freddie,

259
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,600
but... but what they're plannin',

260
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,160
which is a military trial of civilians,

261
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,160
is an atrocity.

262
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
No, no. What she did is an atrocity.

263
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,480
There's no presumption of innocence,

264
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,320
no burden of proof,
no jury of your peers and no appeal.

265
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,600
All right, you were one
of Lincoln's pallbearers, too.

266
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,240
How can you represent her?

267
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,640
She's entitled to a defense, Freddie,

268
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,280
so I shall defend her.

269
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,880
Mary E. Surratt,

270
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,760
in aid of the existing armed rebellion
against the United States,

271
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,080
you are charged with having received,
entertained, harbored, concealed,

272
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,000
aided and assisted John Wilkes Booth,

273
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,720
John A. Surratt
and their confederates...

274
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
David E. Herold...

275
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,320
Lewis Payne...

276
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,440
George A. Atzerodt...

277
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
Michael O'Laughlen...

278
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
Edmund Spangler...

279
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,720
Samuel A. Mudd...

280
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,360
and Samuel Arnold...

281
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
in traitorous and murderous conspiracy

282
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,280
to kill then-President Abraham Lincoln,

283
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,000
Vice President Andrew Johnson

284
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,360
and Secretary of State
William Seward.

285
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,240
Pursuant to special orders
number 211 and 216,

286
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,080
how do you plead?

287
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,320
What say you, madam?

288
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,120
Guilty or not?

289
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,720
I am innocent.

290
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
In that case,
as each of the defendants

291
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,280
has entered a not-guilty plea,
we will begin.

292
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,160
Judge Advocate Holt,
please proceed.

293
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,240
Just a moment, Your Honor.

294
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,560
What is it, Senator?

295
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,480
I... I wish to request an adjournment.

296
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,360
An adjournment? We just got here.

297
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,360
My client has been in custody
for a month,

298
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,840
wasn't allowed to contact counsel
until yesterday.

299
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,920
General Hunter, a delay will only serve
to prolong the nation's sorrow.

300
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,080
My learned colleague,

301
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,320
you've had over four weeks
to prepare your case,

302
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,560
no doubt assisted by
the entire War Department.

303
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,760
I believe the defendant is entitled
to equal consideration.

304
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:59,200
Senator Johnson, our fellow citizens
must be permitted to put this tragedy to rest.

305
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,080
The sooner we dispose of this matter,
the better... for everyone.

306
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,160
Everyone but my client.

307
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.

308
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,960
In that case, I move for termination.

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,200
Termination?

310
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,920
On the grounds
this trial is unconstitutional.

311
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
The defendant is a civilian

312
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,320
entitled to a public trial
before a jury of her peers.

313
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,760
The attorney general has affirmed
the legitimacy of this proceeding.

314
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,120
Has he furnished a verdict as well?

315
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,040
Senator.

316
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,400
You will mind the horror
which summons us.

317
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,680
Indeed.

318
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,400
We all mourn the loss
of our leader,

319
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,000
but in our grief, let us not betray
our better judgment

320
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,320
and partake in an inquisition.

321
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,280
Inquisition? How dare you?

322
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,000
Sounds to me like we have
the enemy among us.

323
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,560
Maryland not being among our most loyal
of states during the war,

324
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,520
its senator ought to certify his allegiance
to this court.

325
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,400
I have served this nation
as its attorney general.

326
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
That is certification enough.

327
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,760
Nevertheless,
we may require counsel

328
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
to sign this oath of loyalty

329
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,520
as prescribed by Congress.

330
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,960
I am a member of Congress,

331
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,520
the same body that creates armies,

332
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,160
authorizes military tribunals

333
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,960
and makes major generals like you.

334
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,440
Our authorization comes
from the War secretary, Edwin Stanton,

335
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,360
and by order of the president.

336
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,600
If our founding fathers
had desired tyranny to prevail,

337
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,080
the president
and his War secretary

338
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,520
would have been granted
such indiscriminate powers,

339
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,440
but they drafted a Constitution

340
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,680
with laws against such powers.

341
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,400
They did so precisely for times like this.

342
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
Order! Order! Order!

343
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,360
I really want you to do this for me, Freddie.

344
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
You're not serious.

345
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,880
As serious as the charges
against our client.

346
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
Me? Defend her?

347
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,960
She doesn't stand a chance

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,200
with an old Southerner
like me defending her.

349
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,120
She needs a Yankee captain like you.

350
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm sorry, sir. I... I can't do it.

351
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,800
No, you'll do fine, son.

352
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
Experience matters for nothing

353
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,280
when they're making up the rules
as they go along.

354
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,720
Besides, this government
has never executed a woman.

355
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,600
They've never considered a woman,
nor a man for that matter,

356
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,880
capable of murdering the president.

357
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,720
Sir, I can find you a rebel
to defend her,

358
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,600
but I ca... I won't do it.

359
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,480
There is no court in the Union

360
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,120
that would fairly judge that woman
with a Confederate counsel.

361
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,720
I won't betray my country.

362
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,040
I won't betray my friends
who died defending it.

363
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm not asking you to betray
your allegiances, Freddie.

364
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm simply askin' you...
rather tellin' you...

365
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,680
to obey your oath as a... as an attorney
and do your job.

366
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,400
He wants me to represent Mary Surratt.

367
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,200
What?

368
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,680
- What?
- Yeah.

369
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,400
He can't be serious.

370
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,880
They're the actors from the theater.

371
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Open up.

372
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,000
Thank you, soldier.

373
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,560
That'll be all.

374
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,480
This conversation is privileged.

375
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,000
Sorry, sir. Orders.

376
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,160
Where is Senator Johnson?

377
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,200
The senator has instructed me
to handle your case.

378
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,240
You understand what you've been
charged with?

379
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,120
Conspiring to murder the president,

380
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,400
secretary of State
and the vice president...

381
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,200
if found guilty, you could hang?

382
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,600
No disrespect, Mr...

383
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,160
Aiken.

384
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,760
Mr. Aiken.

385
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
How many years have you?

386
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,880
27.

387
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,720
So you've handled cases
like this before?

388
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,840
There's never been
a case like this before.

389
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,600
But you have defended others.

390
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
They've left nothing to chance.

391
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
Very well.

392
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
You own a boarding house
on 541 H Street?

393
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,840
Is that correct?

394
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,040
Yes.

395
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,240
How long you been there?

396
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,080
Ma'am?

397
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,880
All I know about you
is what I read in the papers.

398
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
It's not flattering.

399
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,440
I moved to Washington a year ago

400
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,320
with my son and daughter
after my husband passed.

401
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,120
And the assassins were frequent
visitors to your home.

402
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,320
Yes.

403
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,520
Well, you... heh.

404
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,120
You don't even deny
having been acquainted

405
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,120
with John Wilkes Booth
and the others behind bars?

406
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,000
No, sir, I do not.

407
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,440
My husband died a drunk, Mr. Aiken,

408
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,200
and left me loads of debt.

409
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,760
I had to support my family,
so I rented rooms to boarders.

410
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,560
Those men were customers,
nothing more.

411
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,880
And you never considered
their allegiances?

412
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,280
I didn't ask about their allegiances.

413
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,040
What about yours, ma'am?

414
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,200
I am a Southerner.

415
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,440
I'm a Catholic

416
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,800
and a devoted mother
above all else...

417
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,360
but I am no assassin.

418
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,840
Your freedom is gonna require
greater assurances than that.

419
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,200
Then you tell me what I should say
to those generals.

420
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,800
Oh, you can't say a thing.

421
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,520
You're prohibited from testifying
in your own defense.

422
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,080
Perhaps your son could speak for you.

423
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,680
Any idea where he's hiding?

424
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,920
No, I don't.

425
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,640
All right. Is there anyone
who will give your version of events?

426
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,480
You mean the truth?

427
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,360
Well, obviously the government
believes your version is not the truth.

428
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,880
Based on what?

429
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,880
They're not releasing their list of witnesses

430
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
or the evidence they'll use against you.

431
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,520
And can they do that?

432
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,800
This kind of proceeding,

433
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,760
they can do to you
whatever they want.

434
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,520
Well, then what difference
does it make?

435
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,320
Those generals
have made up their minds.

436
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,920
I can tell by the way
they look at me.

437
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
The way they look at you?

438
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,360
Just the same way
you're looking at me.

439
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,360
I have to go.

440
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,520
Good day.

441
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,080
Mr. Aiken, I haven't a word
from my daughter since I've been here.

442
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,040
Would you look in on her for me?

443
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
I'd be most grateful.

444
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,880
Thank you.

445
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,240
Soldier.

446
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,200
Frederick Aiken,
lawyer to Mary Surratt.

447
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,720
It's perfect.

448
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Pardon?

449
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,640
Anna Surratt?

450
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,280
My name is Frederick Aiken.

451
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,720
I'm representing your mother.

452
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,360
What's perfect?

453
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,960
Uh, nothing.

454
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,440
No, do tell.

455
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,520
I'm sure I've heard much worse.

456
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,760
Well, I was just thinking
that this would be the perfect place

457
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,400
to conspire to overthrow
the government.

458
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,400
No one would ever suspect.

459
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,400
Right?

460
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,400
You alone here?

461
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
Yes.

462
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,600
Why? Are you afraid
to be seen with me?

463
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,760
Your mother asked
that I look in on you.

464
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,960
Please tell her not to worry,

465
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,400
since I'm a prisoner in my own house.

466
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,200
Where's your brother's room?

467
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,920
Second floor, on the left.

468
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,720
Did you find what you were looking for?

469
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,400
Uh, yes.

470
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,280
Did your brother share a room
with an L.J. W?

471
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,960
Louis J. Weichmann.

472
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,720
He was like a son to my mother.
He'll swear she's innocent.

473
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,120
I suppose he's disappeared, too.

474
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,800
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Aiken?

475
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,800
Kill any on our side?

476
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,160
Miss, do you have any documents

477
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,080
indicating who stayed here
or a ledger of accounts?

478
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,880
Do you want me to help
your mother or not?

479
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,600
Is there anything else
you're concealing?

480
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,680
Such as?

481
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
Your brother, to start.
Look, if you know...

482
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,160
Did you see who threw that?

483
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
No, sir.

484
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,120
Are you hurt?

485
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm fine.

486
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,280
Mr. Aiken, if you have no further
need of me...

487
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,280
Here. I'll give you two to sell.

488
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,280
You have the latest on this one?

489
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,560
That, I'll take two.

490
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,320
Cigars! Jars!

491
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,240
Picture frames!

492
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,840
Original, right here, ma'am.

493
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,200
Who wants a cigar?

494
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,880
Fresh roasted nuts here.

495
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,080
Fresh roasted nuts.

496
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,320
Move along.
Mustn't keep it blocked.

497
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,600
Thank you very much.

498
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Left.

499
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,080
Left, right, left.

500
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,400
- Cigars!
- Left...

501
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,440
Cigars!

502
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,000
Left. Left. Left.

503
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,840
Left, right, left.

504
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,400
Left...

505
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,840
Company, arms rest.

506
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,640
- March.
- Shoulder arms.

507
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,880
Quick step.

508
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,200
Left.

509
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,400
Left, right, left.

510
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
A chance to get it back?

511
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
There he is.

512
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,720
- Fred.
- Hey.

513
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,240
Hamilton here has offered
to be your second chair.

514
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,200
Oh. Re... Not a chance in hell.

515
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,720
- No? You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

516
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,040
I'll carry his briefcase,
but I'm not...

517
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,080
- Sarah.
- Fred.

518
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,400
Why are you here?

519
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,200
I'm trying to understand
why you're here.

520
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,560
I suppose I should wish you luck.

521
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,480
Come to order.

522
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,840
How is Anna, Mr. Aiken?

523
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
She's fine...

524
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,480
Iooking forward
to when you come home.

525
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,960
That's very nice of you to say, Mr. Aiken.

526
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,720
Judge Advocate Holt,
will you please proceed?

527
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,600
In the matter of Mary Surratt,

528
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,920
the prosecution calls as its first witness
Mr. Louis Weichmann.

529
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,720
I thought he was like family.
Why are they calling him?

530
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,720
Place your right hand on this Bible.

531
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,680
I don't know.

532
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,560
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

533
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,640
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

534
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,640
I do.

535
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,640
Please.

536
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,840
Are you acquainted with the defendant,
Mary Surratt?

537
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,800
Yes. Yes, I am.

538
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,480
I attended Divinity College
with her son John.

539
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,600
And until recently,

540
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,200
you resided at the boarding house

541
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,000
owned by Mary Surratt.
Is that correct?

542
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,760
That is correct, sir.

543
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,240
Were any of these men
ever present in her home?

544
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,520
Yes, sir.

545
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
These three over there

546
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,240
on several occasions.

547
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,080
Let the record reflect
that the witness has identified

548
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,480
the prisoners Herold,
Payne and Atzerodt.

549
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,760
And who invited these men?

550
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,000
John Surratt.

551
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Objection.

552
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,160
Objection?

553
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,760
Uh, uh...

554
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,760
There's no way to prove
that John Surratt

555
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,960
even knew these men,
let alone invited them.

556
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,400
Mr. Surratt's absence
from this proceeding

557
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,840
is Mr. Surratt's problem.

558
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,000
Objection overruled.
Continue, Mr. Holt.

559
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,320
Was John Wilkes Booth
also a frequent guest of John Surratt?

560
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,520
Indeed, but all the Surratts adored him...

561
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,040
John, his sister Anna
and their mother, too.

562
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,640
And were there ever meetings

563
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,280
held at the boarding house
involving Mr. Booth?

564
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
Many, sometimes lasting
two, three hours

565
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,600
and always in secret,
behind closed doors.

566
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,400
And did you ever see Mary Surratt

567
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,520
object to these, uh, meetings?

568
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,880
No, sir.

569
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,680
Or to the presence of those men?

570
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
No, she did not.

571
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,720
- Thank you.
- She appeared to welcome them.

572
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,800
Thank you. That'll be all,
Mr. Weichmann.

573
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,840
How long did you say these
secret meetings lasted?

574
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
At least two, three hours.

575
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,480
You were timing them?

576
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,120
Eh, if you were timing them,

577
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,360
I suppose these secret meetings

578
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,920
were not, in fact, kept secret from you.

579
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,120
I knew about them, sir,

580
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,520
but I had no knowledge
of what they were about.

581
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,000
And that is because you never attended
any yourself, correct?

582
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,760
Exactly.

583
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,120
Why was that?

584
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,120
I thought them suspicious.

585
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,480
Suspicious?

586
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,280
Well, then, you see, you did know
what they were about.

587
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,120
No, sir, I did not.

588
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,960
Then why were
your suspicions aroused?

589
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,520
By the snatches
of rebel conversation

590
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,400
I overheard in the hallways
and by their frequent whisperings.

591
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,120
Well, in that case, if it was
of such great concern to you,

592
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,880
why did you not report your suspicions
to your superiors at the War Department?

593
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,280
I did.

594
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,280
Excuse me?

595
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,560
I did reveal my suspicions.

596
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,840
I made a confidant of Captain Gleason
in the War Department.

597
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,160
Mr. Aiken, if there's nothing else...

598
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,840
Counselor, will that be all?

599
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
Uh, yes.

600
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,320
Uh, no.

601
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,320
No. No, I do have something else.

602
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,760
Tell me, Mr. Weichmann. Tell us all.

603
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,120
- You ever been in Richmond?
- Objection.

604
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,880
I merely wish to know if the witness

605
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,160
has ever visited the capital
of the Confederacy.

606
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't recall.

607
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,320
Then perhaps this train receipt
will refresh your memory.

608
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,120
It indicates passage to Richmond,

609
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,920
and it has your initials on it.

610
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,760
Yes.

611
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
That's right.

612
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,200
I considered continuing my divinity studies
there after the war.

613
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,120
I plan on becoming a priest.

614
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,320
That's very nice.

615
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,240
Do you recall, Mr. Weichmann,

616
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,000
at which institute in Richmond
you were thinking of enrolling?

617
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,000
The name?

618
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,320
Yes, Mr. Weichmann, the name.

619
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,400
Well, uh...

620
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,080
- There is no academy of the kind...
- Objection.

621
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,440
...in Richmond, is there,
Mr. Weichmann?

622
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,240
- In fact, perhaps you visited Richmond...
- Objection, General.

623
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,520
...for another purpose entirely.

624
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,680
Objection sustained.

625
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,280
You worked for the general in charge
of rebel prisoners, did you not?

626
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,400
Yes.

627
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
So?

628
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,720
Perhaps a distinguished clerk like yourself
knew certain information.

629
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,200
What sort of information?

630
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,960
Information that might have been
of divine interest

631
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,400
to certain rebels within the capital
of the Confederacy.

632
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
Objection, General.

633
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,200
The witness is not on trial here.

634
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,720
Well, he ought to be!

635
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Objection sustained.

636
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,280
The witness is not on trial.

637
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,480
Sir, I am merely trying to establish
the witness' credibility

638
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,320
or rather the lack of credibility
of this man.

639
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,320
Mr. Aiken, you are incriminating
the witness.

640
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,480
Incriminating? Sir,

641
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,040
Louis Weichmann shared a room
with John Surratt.

642
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,560
I have a ticket that puts him
in Richmond.

643
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,240
I think it reasonable to assume

644
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,840
that he knows more about this plot
to assassinate our president

645
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,360
than he supposedly reported.

646
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,720
What Mr. Aiken thinks
is entirely immaterial.

647
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,240
Counselor, unless you have something
more relevant to ask,

648
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,840
the witness will step down.

649
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,960
No.

650
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
No, I have nothing more... relevant to ask.

651
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,640
You never... you never ask a question

652
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,600
you don't know the answer to.

653
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,760
I know. I know.

654
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,560
How... How did you know Weichmann
was lying about Richmond, Fred?

655
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,160
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

656
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,160
S-so you gambled twice?

657
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,000
How did you pass the bar?

658
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Well, Will, it worked.

659
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,280
I mean, Fred made Weichmann
look as guilty as the others.

660
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,920
- It was perfect.
- You're right.

661
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,640
And that's the problem.

662
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,040
They all look guilty.

663
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,160
Freddie, I'm sorry.

664
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,320
First the senator drops your client
like a load,

665
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,640
and then with all these
secret meetings taking place,

666
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,600
either she knew what was going on...

667
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,800
Or she damn well should have known.

668
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,880
Senator?

669
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,560
In here.

670
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,760
I think she's as guilty as Booth.

671
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,720
How could I possibly defend her?

672
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,640
You assume that she's guilty,
like the Commission.

673
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,240
You don't have any proof.

674
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,400
Proof or no,

675
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,960
don't give a damn what happens to her.

676
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,400
I tell you what.

677
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,320
If you can prove that she's guilty,

678
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,560
you can take yourself off the case.

679
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,160
Thank you, sir.

680
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,760
You think it'll be that easy?

681
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,160
I know it.

682
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,320
Pardon me, Father.

683
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,520
I wish to confer with the prisoner.

684
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,240
Alone, if you don't mind.

685
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,960
It's... It's quite all right, Mary.

686
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,560
I... I must be going anyway.

687
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,120
All right. Well, thank you
for visiting, Father.

688
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,000
I'll see you soon.

689
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,320
Your words were most comforting.

690
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,680
The Lord's with you.

691
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,160
She's refusing to eat.

692
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,280
I've tried to convince her to no avail.

693
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,040
Perhaps you could help her.

694
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,680
"Search me, and know my heart.

695
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,600
"Try me, and know my thoughts.

696
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,600
And see if there be any wicked way in me."

697
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,240
"The Lord knows the way of the wicked.

698
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,960
And the way of the wicked will perish."

699
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,240
You know your Proverbs, young man.

700
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,640
My father was a minister.

701
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,520
He taught them to me as a child.

702
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,640
So, what is it you wish to know?

703
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,680
Why Booth and his associates
were constants in your home.

704
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,120
I ran a boarding house, Mr. Aiken.

705
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,320
Forgive me if I chose
to fill it with boarders.

706
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,960
I checked your registry, ma'am.

707
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,600
There's no record Booth ever
stayed at your home.

708
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,120
No, the fact is he stayed at the National
whenever he came to Washington,

709
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,000
so why was Booth in your home?

710
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,200
I suppose my son invited him.
They were friends.

711
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,320
Famous actor like Booth?

712
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,280
Engaging your son
out of friendship?

713
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,520
Mr. Aiken, my son is no less
a gentleman than you

714
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,880
and very capable of forming
acquaintances in society.

715
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,000
I've... I've read all about
your family's acquaintances, ma'am,

716
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,800
about how your late husband contributed
to the Confederate cause

717
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,600
and about your Gentleman Johnny.

718
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,440
What about him?

719
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,280
He made quite a sum as a courier
carrying rebel secrets across Union lines.

720
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh, I'm well aware

721
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,560
of what your family's capable of,
Mrs. Surratt,

722
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,240
so I know you're not
telling me the truth.

723
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,600
Well, then you know what I do not.

724
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,800
You were despondent
over losing the war,

725
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,680
and you would have done anything
you could to save the Confederacy,

726
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,160
including using your own son John.

727
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,360
Honestly, Mr. Aiken.

728
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,560
So you arranged a meeting with Booth,

729
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
figuring he'd befriend your son
because of what he knew,

730
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,000
what expert couriers do know.

731
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,320
And what might that be?

732
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,400
The best escape routes out of town.

733
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,120
Your son was supposed to lead the others
to freedom that night, wasn't he?

734
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Except he was the only one
that got away.

735
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,200
My son was in Canada that day.

736
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,480
Can you prove that?

737
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,280
I received a letter on April 14,

738
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,600
same day as the assassination,

739
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,280
sent from Montreal.

740
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,240
Where is this letter?

741
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,800
I don't know.

742
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,560
I'm done,

743
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,840
done defending your lies.

744
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,080
You're so blind with hatred, Mr. Aiken,

745
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,440
you can't even see the truth.

746
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,960
Yes, my son hated the North.
We all did.

747
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,640
How can a Southerner feel anything
but bitterness toward your side?

748
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,520
But my son did not conspire
to kill your president.

749
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,960
He conspired to kidnap him.

750
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,240
All right, here he comes.

751
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,080
Ready your mount.

752
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,640
Surratt, where the hell's Booth?

753
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,160
He'll be here.

754
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,320
All right, steady.

755
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,800
Wait!

756
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,000
He's not coming!

757
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,760
Lincoln's changed his plans.

758
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,480
- What?
- He's still in town.

759
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
He just gave a speech
at the National.

760
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,080
Anna, back upstairs.

761
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,600
Who was in the carriage?

762
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,400
Doesn't matter. What matters
is he wasn't in the carriage.

763
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,400
You should have known.

764
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,400
What about the weapons?

765
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,600
We need to hide these weapons.

766
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,800
We can take them to Lloyd's.

767
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,760
I'll take 'em.

768
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,240
You'd shoot your own foot off.

769
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
I said I'd do it.

770
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,360
Don't push me.

771
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,920
Enough!

772
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,040
Fools like you are the reason
we can lose this fight.

773
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,320
Johnny Surratt,
I'd like a word with you, please.

774
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,280
Well, answer, Johnny.
Your mama's callin'.

775
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,280
They planned on ransoming
Lincoln in exchange

776
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,240
for all the Confederate soldiers
in your prisons.

777
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,760
Why didn't you report them
to the authorities?

778
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,240
Because one of them was my son.

779
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,440
So rather than kidnap him,

780
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,120
your son helped murder
the president instead.

781
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,120
No.

782
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,880
They nearly got the vice president
and the secretary of State.

783
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,400
No, it's not true. It's not my Johnny.

784
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,560
Damn it, ma'am, you just said
he was Booth's right hand.

785
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,120
My son is not a murderer, Mr. Aiken.

786
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,920
All right, then.

787
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,520
Swear to it.

788
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,440
Supper will be ready shortly.

789
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
John?

790
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,800
Can't stay, mama.

791
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,840
I have to leave town straightaway.

792
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,120
What's so pressing?

793
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,800
Nothing that need worry you.

794
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,440
Just some cotton speculatin'. That's all.

795
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,520
Don't sport with me, son.

796
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,520
You're not steppin' outside this house.

797
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,480
Don't talk to me like I'm a child!

798
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,840
Richmond's falling.
Something must be done.

799
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,880
Johnny, I'm aware of the news
from Richmond,

800
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,800
and it pains me terribly.

801
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,880
Supper's ready.

802
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,680
Wh-what is it?

803
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,680
I'm leaving town.

804
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,080
No, you're not leaving town.

805
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,080
Yes, I am.

806
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,680
You and Anna are the only family I've got left,

807
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,160
and I'll be damned if I let you go out there
and do something else foolish.

808
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,280
- Foolish?
- Johnny...

809
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,440
What I'm fightin' for is far more important
than any of us.

810
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,120
Your family is more important
than anything.

811
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,240
That is your responsibility!

812
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,200
All of our men are buried underground
right now.

813
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,600
- The war is over.
- Oh, you're wrong about that.

814
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,000
There is nothing left for you to do.

815
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,760
The war is far from over,
and there's still plenty I can do.

816
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,960
- Johnny, please.
- Unhand me, Mother.

817
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,160
- Unhand me, Mother.
- Please, Anna.

818
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,440
John!

819
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,880
Mother.

820
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,480
John, are you coming or not?

821
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,640
Johnny, please.

822
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,640
If this cause ain't worth fightin' for,
then what is?

823
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,840
So that was the last time
you saw your son?

824
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,920
Yes.

825
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,880
Less than two weeks
before the assassination?

826
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,840
Yes.

827
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,560
So then, you see, you admit

828
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,800
that your son conspired to kill
President Lincoln.

829
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,880
I don't know.

830
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,320
May God help you.

831
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,640
Honestly, Mr. Aiken, I don't know.

832
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,120
Lord, I pray not.

833
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,280
All I know is that I did not.

834
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,560
I swear.

835
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,440
Miss Surratt.

836
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,520
You have to tell me exactly...

837
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,520
How is my mother?

838
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,160
She's managing.
You have to tell me

839
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,120
exactly what happened here.

840
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,280
What do you mean?

841
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,360
Do you know that Louis Weichmann,
uh, your friend,

842
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,320
testified against your mother

843
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,680
after you told me
he was like a son to her?

844
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,520
What went on here?

845
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,000
Why should I trust you?

846
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,800
Because your mother
told me everything.

847
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,520
She told me about John.

848
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,440
She told me about the plot to kidnap
President Lincoln.

849
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,800
Anna, did you try and stop him?

850
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,720
How was I supposed to do that?

851
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,080
'Cause you're his older sister.

852
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,200
You don't know how stubborn
my brother can be.

853
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,520
All right. Did your brother
conspire to kill the president?

854
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,280
My brother left town weeks
before the assassination.

855
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,720
It proves nothing. Look, the night
he left the boarding house...

856
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,720
I've said all I will.

857
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,360
Miss Surratt, I'm trying...

858
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,680
I'm trying to help.

859
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,760
By condemning my brother?

860
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,600
Mr. Aiken, my mother would never
allow that, and neither would I.

861
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,360
Oh. All right. All right, look,
you knew about Weichmann.

862
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,960
If you know any potential witnesses
the prosecution might call

863
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,200
or what evidence
they'll use against her,

864
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,520
you must tell me.

865
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,160
Will you help me?

866
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,200
Let us proceed with events

867
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,120
following the assassination
of President Lincoln.

868
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,800
On the night of April 17,

869
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,480
what were your duties, Major Smith?

870
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,320
I was charged with finding John Surratt,

871
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,280
and we were searching the house.

872
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,000
Major, I found these.

873
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,640
They were here
in the daughter's bedroom.

874
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,080
Major Smith, please read aloud
what's inscribed here.

875
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,880
"Sic semper tyrannis."

876
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,560
Could you translate?

877
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,560
Of course.
"Thus always for tyrants."

878
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,240
Are those words familiar to you?

879
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,440
Indeed.

880
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,320
Booth yelled them
after he cut down our president.

881
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,000
You found the same three days later

882
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,360
in her daughter's bedroom
next to a photograph

883
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,560
of the assassin himself.

884
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,360
Like a shrine, sir.

885
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,680
Uh...

886
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,240
Please continue.

887
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,520
Uh, objection.

888
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,360
Sic semper tyrannis
is the state motto of Virginia.

889
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,240
It hardly constitutes proof
of a shrine to Booth.

890
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,320
No further proof is needed,
Mr. Aiken.

891
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,480
Proceed, Mr. Holt.

892
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,120
Continue, Major Smith.

893
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,440
As I was fixing to take the Surratts
to headquarters for questioning,

894
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,040
there was a knock at the door.

895
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,120
You all right, ma'am?

896
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,680
I... I must be mistaken.

897
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,600
Wait a minute.

898
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,840
Whom do you wish to see?

899
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,520
Uh, Mrs. Surratt.

900
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,720
This is her place.
Bring him in.

901
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,000
Is she expecting you?

902
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,280
She sent for me, asked me
to dig a gutter for her.

903
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,720
At this time of night?

904
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,120
In the morning. I just wanted
to know what time.

905
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,040
Bring Mrs. Surratt in here.

906
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,200
Ma'am, did you hire this man
to dig a gutter for you?

907
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,840
No, sir.

908
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,320
Do you know this man?

909
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,720
No, sir.

910
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,040
Is this the man
she denies knowing?

911
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,600
No, sir.

912
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,640
Is this the man
she denies knowing?

913
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,120
Yes, sir.

914
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,800
Lewis Payne.

915
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,600
The same man boarded at the Surratts'

916
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,640
prior to daggering the secretary of State
and his kin.

917
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,880
Yes.

918
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,920
Thank you, Major.
Nothing further.

919
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,440
Major Smith, are you aware
that Lewis Payne

920
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,680
boarded at the Surratts' under an alias,

921
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,720
claiming to be a Baptist minister
from Baltimore named Wood?

922
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,400
That's what she claimed.

923
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,400
She claimed?

924
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,640
I would like to submit into evidence
this ledger of guest accounts

925
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,640
from the Surratt boarding house.

926
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,480
Supposing, as this evidence would seem
to suggest, that that were the truth...

927
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,360
suppose Mrs. Surratt simply failed that night

928
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,960
to recognize Wood the preacher

929
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,440
in the guise of Payne the ditch digger.

930
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,120
He was standing in full view of her
not three paces.

931
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,520
General Hunter, since accepting this case,

932
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,880
I have come to learn that my client's
eyesight is defective.

933
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,160
I have here a sworn affidavit
from her doctor stating just that.

934
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,600
Major Smith, it was dark.
It was nighttime.

935
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,120
Isn't it possible Mary Surratt simply...

936
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,600
failed to see him?

937
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,200
If I saw a man dressed as a preacher

938
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,880
and two months later a laborer,

939
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,240
then I would recognize him
as the same person.

940
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,200
Thank you, Major Smith.

941
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,280
A simple yes or no will do.

942
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,920
Is it possible she failed
to see him properly?

943
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,240
Yes, I suppose it's possible.

944
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,160
No further questions.

945
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,040
The prosecution seems unable
to present any proof of guilt

946
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,040
beyond a reasonable doubt.

947
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,760
Uh, could somebody bring me
the transcript of today's trial?

948
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,480
Shall I read it aloud to you?

949
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
Oh, Ed.

950
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,440
Your young associate is
putting up a spirited defense.

951
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,600
Reminds me of a certain lawyer
I had to face 25 years ago.

952
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,880
Ah, he learned to fight in your army.

953
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,600
Can I get you a drink?

954
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,520
No, no. No, I won't be staying long.
Reverdy...

955
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,400
You've done as much for this nation
as any man I know.

956
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,040
Oh. Feeling's mutual, Ed.

957
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:09,040
Don't you think it's time for us two
old war horses to call a truce?

958
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,320
Not if you insist on staging
this travesty.

959
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,320
This trial will do more
to keep the peace

960
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,240
than any paper treaty could.

961
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,600
Heh. How'd you convince
yourself of that?

962
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,120
Because justice, swift and firm,

963
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,000
will help deter the South
from ever conspiring again,

964
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,880
as well as discouraging the North
from seeking revenge.

965
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,720
What about the rule of law?

966
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,480
My first responsibility is to ensure
that this war stays won.

967
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,720
Oh, and this is how you do it,

968
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,120
by keeping fear alive
as long as you see fit?

969
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,920
Look. "Stanton warns
of future rebel plots,"

970
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,440
uh, water supplies poisoned, um...

971
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,560
firebombing cities.

972
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,520
Uh, yellow fever spreading
all over the place.

973
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,120
This is a frightened country, Ed.

974
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,640
You don't need to scare us anymore.

975
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,960
And who is to say that none
of these things could happen?

976
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,680
The unspeakable already has...

977
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,840
Our president assassinated,
600,000 dead.

978
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,640
The world has changed, Reverdy.

979
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,680
Abandoning the Constitution
is not the answer.

980
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,720
You may prefer dining alone.

981
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,640
I just hope your young associate
does as well.

982
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,200
If he pushes too hard,

983
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,960
he will make enemies
who will not soon forget.

984
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,640
On this, you know I'm right.

985
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,440
I'm here to see Secretary Stanton, boys.

986
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,960
Stand down.

987
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,520
Sorry, sir. Mr. Stanton doesn't see anyone
without an appointment.

988
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,040
Well, good morning, Mr. Aiken.

989
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,040
Morning.

990
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,200
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

991
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,680
If you can arrange an appointment
for me with the secretary, you can.

992
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,760
Unfortunately he's quite busy right now,

993
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,880
but perhaps you'd care
to have a word with me instead.

994
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,160
Please.

995
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,720
My client is unwell.

996
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,120
So I hear.
Touch of the woman's curse.

997
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,400
I'm sure she'll be well enough
to continue her trial in a few days.

998
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,640
She's been in solitary confinement
for over a month.

999
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,680
She hasn't eaten in over a week.

1000
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,840
She's refusing to eat.

1001
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,760
All the prisoners are fed daily.

1002
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,040
Soft bread and salted meat.

1003
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,400
Unless she has a proper meal
and some fresh air,

1004
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,200
I can't guarantee
she'll be fit for trial.

1005
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,320
One of the conspirators
refuses to be guarded by a Negro,

1006
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,640
and the other insists on only eating
his mother's cooking.

1007
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,840
We can't accommodate every whim.

1008
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,280
Come now. I am merely asking for you
to stop treating her like a savage.

1009
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,240
How dare you accuse us of savagery?

1010
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,840
Have you forgotten how our own
were treated by the rebels?

1011
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,840
Of course not.

1012
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,840
Well...

1013
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,560
But Mary Surratt is in serious decline.

1014
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,080
If this treatment of her continues,
she will not be sound of mind.

1015
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,600
And I trust that is something
the government wishes to avoid.

1016
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,760
I may have a way to serve all interests.

1017
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,720
I'll deny ever telling you this.
Understood?

1018
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,760
Father.

1019
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Counselor.

1020
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,040
Feel that sun.

1021
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,000
Do I have you to thank for this?

1022
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,040
Well, thank you.

1023
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,240
Well, if I could just get you
to start eating.

1024
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,520
Left. Left.

1025
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,880
Left, right, left.

1026
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,920
Company halt.

1027
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,240
Mary, there's something
I need to ask you.

1028
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,280
I've never seen you at a loss for words,
young man.

1029
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,120
Do you know where your son is hiding?

1030
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,160
Johnny?

1031
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,240
Of course not.

1032
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,680
Government believes you do.

1033
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,120
What do you believe?

1034
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,280
I believe you know more
than you're willing to tell me.

1035
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:40,720
Uh, have you ever cared for something
greater than yourself?

1036
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,360
I've spent these last four years

1037
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,720
fighting for something
greater than myself,

1038
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,520
so don't...

1039
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,120
Then we are the same.

1040
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,800
Mary, you have to tell us
where your son is.

1041
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,360
Us?

1042
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,520
I have to tell "us"?

1043
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,960
Whose side are you on?

1044
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,400
I'm trying to defend you.

1045
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,440
By suggesting I trade
my son for myself?

1046
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,760
You're trying to save you, Mr. Aiken.

1047
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,440
I wish I could give you
what you need. I truly do.

1048
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,800
But if you want out,
you'll have to find another way.

1049
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,440
I'm gonna take a walk.

1050
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,720
It's so nice out.

1051
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,000
Do you care to walk with me?

1052
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,760
So we're stuck
in these shallow trenches.

1053
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,920
We're surrounded on all sides.

1054
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,680
Nobody knows what to do.
Nobody knows what to say.

1055
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,800
We're frozen,
completely petrified.

1056
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,280
And then from somewhere
up on the hill,

1057
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,400
we hear this loud
booming Southern voice.

1058
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,600
It's the rebel general.

1059
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,760
He yells, "Y'all boys
better say your prayers,

1060
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,200
because there are 400 of us
and only 100 of you."

1061
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,520
You can stop right there, Baker.

1062
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,680
And so then this madman,
he stands up,

1063
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,800
and he yells back to him,
and he says...

1064
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,920
he says, "Hundred?
Heck, we've got less than that.

1065
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,040
But we don't surrender,
so come and get us."

1066
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,040
And with that,

1067
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,360
he pulls down his pants
and bares his arse.

1068
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,960
You didn't.

1069
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
- I didn't.
- What?

1070
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,880
It doesn't seem as though Fred
ever intends to surrender.

1071
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,560
Ah, it appears he already has.

1072
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,320
She's fair, fit and 40.

1073
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,640
Is it true Mrs. Surratt is a Catholic,

1074
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,400
wears black from head to toe?

1075
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,760
I hear she spits in the faces
of every Union soldier she encounters.

1076
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,800
Apparently she wears a necklace
made from the bone of a Union soldier.

1077
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,720
Seriously, Fred, do you honestly
doubt she's guilty?

1078
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,280
So, okay, who would like to dance?

1079
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,200
- Yes.
- Yes. Good.

1080
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,800
Dance?

1081
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,400
It's more like a wake.

1082
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,840
I suppose I should have dressed
more like Mrs. Surratt.

1083
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,960
Fred, what are you doing?

1084
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,160
I'm enduring the pain
of having to listen to Baker.

1085
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,320
You know what I mean.

1086
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,680
If she's found guilty,
they'll say you weren't up to the task.

1087
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,760
And God forbid you prevail.

1088
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,720
They'll think you just as much
a traitor as she.

1089
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,960
Baker, how 'bout something
a little happier?

1090
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,840
- Little happier?
- Yeah.

1091
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,640
All right, Fred.
Happier, he wants.

1092
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,640
William's right, you know.

1093
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,880
Either outcome, you cannot prevail.

1094
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,280
Sarah.

1095
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,000
What is it about Mary Surratt
you find so compelling?

1096
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,520
These are criminal,
despicable people, Fred.

1097
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,800
They're... they're
the same sort of people

1098
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,720
you risked your life
fighting against,

1099
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,800
and she helped kill
your commander in chief.

1100
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,640
I don't know what she's guilty of.

1101
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,960
May I ask you one more thing?

1102
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,960
What is it, Sarah?

1103
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,840
Does the captain
remember how to dance?

1104
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,080
Of course.

1105
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,720
Few people will forget
what side you fought on.

1106
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,440
Trust me. It can be Ionely.

1107
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,440
I'm just upholding my oath
as an attorney

1108
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,440
and doing my job.
It's what you asked.

1109
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,240
It's what you told me to do.

1110
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,520
This habit of quoting me back to me
could become most irritating.

1111
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,800
You have your mother's convictions
and your father's annoying habits.

1112
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,920
Well, "Mary Surratt is entitled
to a defense, Freddie,

1113
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,600
so I shall defend her."

1114
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:47,120
If they want John Surratt,

1115
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,720
then you should serve him up
on a platter.

1116
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,960
I... I don't mean, uh, physically.
I mean in spirit.

1117
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,320
You have to prove to the Commission

1118
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,240
that he is responsible, not her.

1119
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,680
She's not gonna like that.

1120
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,080
Mr. Lloyd, you are a tenant
of Mary Surratt, are you not?

1121
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,160
Yes, sir.

1122
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,560
I run a tavern some 10 miles
from the city

1123
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,120
on a property she owns.

1124
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,200
And on the afternoon
that President Lincoln was assassinated,

1125
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,440
did Mary Surratt pay you a visit?

1126
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,400
Yes, sir, in the company
of Louis Weichmann.

1127
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,440
And she brought you a package,
did she not?

1128
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,880
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.

1129
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,680
Small package
wrapped in newspaper.

1130
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,240
Did she tell you where
the package came from?

1131
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,600
Said it came from
John Wilkes Booth.

1132
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,160
John Wilkes Booth!

1133
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,880
And what exactly did she give you?

1134
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,280
Objection.

1135
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,600
There's no way the defendant
could have known what was inside.

1136
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,320
He just testified the package
was wrapped.

1137
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:55,840
Overruled.

1138
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,480
Witness will answer the question.

1139
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,360
Mr. Lloyd, what was inside the package?

1140
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,680
Field glasses, sir.

1141
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,840
Field glasses?

1142
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,120
Field glasses like these?

1143
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,280
Exactly.

1144
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,520
With the initials "J.W.B."
Inscribed on them.

1145
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,440
Did she give you any instructions?

1146
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,800
Sir?

1147
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,840
Instructions, Mr. Lloyd?

1148
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,280
Instructions which may affect this trial?

1149
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,240
Oh. Yes, sir.

1150
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,800
Ahem. She told me,

1151
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,880
"Lloyd, get those
shootin' irons ready.

1152
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,280
There will be parties here tonight
who will call for them."

1153
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,280
You liar!

1154
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,280
Order!

1155
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,360
- He's a liar!
- Order!

1156
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,440
- It's a lie.
- Order!

1157
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,360
Control yourself, madam.

1158
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,600
Such outbursts will only
prejudice your case.

1159
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,800
Oh, Lord.

1160
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,360
I just don't see how I could possibly
further prejudice this case, sir.

1161
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,600
Counselor,
you will control your client.

1162
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,200
General.

1163
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,160
Shooting irons!

1164
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,240
Shooting irons.

1165
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,160
And to what was she referring?

1166
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,520
Army rifles, sir,

1167
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,480
hidden in the joist
above the dining room.

1168
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,920
And what else did she tell you?

1169
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,320
She said I was to get two bottles
of whiskey ready, too.

1170
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,240
And were these things called for,

1171
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,120
as per the defendant's instructions?

1172
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,120
Yes, sir.

1173
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,400
About midnight, sir,

1174
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,160
the night of the assassination,

1175
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,200
by two men on horses, one...

1176
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,480
I'd seen before.

1177
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,600
T'other was a stranger to me.

1178
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,960
I brought the items, thinking these
were the parties Mrs. Surratt meant.

1179
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,760
Two of 'em rode off so fast,

1180
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,640
they could have outrun Creation
and give it two-mile a start.

1181
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,920
Your witness.

1182
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,400
I did not...

1183
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,480
Mr. Lloyd.

1184
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,280
Mr. Lloyd, you just testified

1185
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,600
that Louis Weichmann accompanied
the defendant that afternoon.

1186
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,840
Right.

1187
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,760
So then I can correctly assume

1188
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,280
that he would also testify
to having heard her instructions to you.

1189
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,800
No.

1190
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,040
She took me out by the woodpile
out of earshot.

1191
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,800
So you're saying that nobody
heard this conversation,

1192
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,160
just you and her.

1193
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,160
Way it happened, sir.

1194
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,720
Of course it is.

1195
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,200
When did you learn of President Lincoln's
assassination?

1196
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,440
Well, who can forget when they heard?

1197
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,960
The next morning,
a Captain Cottingham told me.

1198
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,400
He was searching for the assassins.

1199
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,240
No doubt, you were most upset.

1200
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:04,960
Indeed.

1201
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,920
I got myself right smart in liquor.

1202
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,160
Yes, you're... you're right smart
in liquor most days,

1203
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,320
- aren't you, Mr. Lloyd?
- Objection.

1204
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,840
In fact, I hear that you're
your own best customer.

1205
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,840
Objection.

1206
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,920
Sustained.

1207
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,240
This Captain Cottingham,

1208
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,280
did he ask you anything in reference
to the assassins?

1209
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,800
He asked if any parties
had passed through.

1210
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,920
Naturally I told him
about the two I knew.

1211
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,960
Actually, you did not.

1212
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,320
According to this witness report,

1213
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,520
you said nothing for two days.

1214
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,880
I was frightened is all.

1215
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,000
I feared the assassins
might come for me.

1216
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,400
Perhaps, though, you were afraid
that the authorities

1217
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,640
might consider you an accessory.

1218
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:58,000
Well, it was through the Surratts
that I got myself in such difficulty.

1219
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,240
The Surratts.

1220
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,000
Don't you mean John Surratt,
to be more precise?

1221
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,480
Wasn't it he who brought
the shooting irons

1222
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,760
to your tavern door
in the first place?

1223
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,760
Yeah.

1224
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,520
And he showed you
where to hide them?

1225
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,840
I didn't want to.

1226
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,960
So you're saying that he asked you,

1227
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,560
forced you to do so against your will.

1228
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,400
Yes.

1229
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,960
So he brought them to you,

1230
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,200
he showed you where to hide them,

1231
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,800
and he forced you to hide them
against your will?

1232
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,440
That's right. Yes, exactly.

1233
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,400
If John Surratt was capable

1234
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,640
of putting Mr. Lloyd,
Louis Weichmann

1235
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,200
and Lord knows
how many others at risk,

1236
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,080
who's to say he didn't do
the same to his mother?

1237
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,240
- Objection.
- Stop this!

1238
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,320
- Sir, it seems the...
- Stop it right now, Mr. Aiken.

1239
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,760
- It seems the only thing...
- Objection.

1240
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,840
- General, objection.
- That Mary Surratt might be guilty of

1241
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,080
- is having given birth to her son John.
- How dare you?

1242
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,600
Objection sustained.
That will be all, Mr. Aiken.

1243
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,960
Just to be clear, Mr. Lloyd,

1244
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,880
it was the defendant, Mary Surratt,

1245
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,000
who just hours before
the assassination

1246
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,400
brought you field glasses

1247
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,960
and instructed you to prepare rifles
and two bottles of whiskey?

1248
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,440
Yeah.

1249
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,440
Thank you.

1250
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,440
General Hunter,

1251
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,560
members of the Commission,

1252
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,320
the government rests its case
against Mary Surratt.

1253
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,440
That'll be all, Mr. Lloyd.
You may step down.

1254
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,560
What did they promise you
to say that, Mr. Lloyd?

1255
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,840
Counselor, I'm warning you.

1256
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,720
Bet a case of whiskey's all it took.

1257
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,080
You best hush up.
I'll put you in the ground, boy.

1258
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,200
Mr. Aiken, you will sit down, sir.

1259
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,600
You shut him up.

1260
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,080
Sit down, sir.

1261
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,600
Now...

1262
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,320
we will adjourn.

1263
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,000
When we resume,

1264
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,880
the defense may call its first witness.

1265
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,080
Left. Left.

1266
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,840
Excuse me, sirs.

1267
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,000
Uh, Captain Cottingham?

1268
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,600
Yes.

1269
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,200
Can I have a word with you, please?

1270
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,760
Sir.

1271
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,000
And did you interview John Lloyd,

1272
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,200
the man who runs the tavern
on Mrs. Surratt's property?

1273
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,680
Yes, right after the assassination.

1274
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,880
And did he tell you that Mrs. Surratt

1275
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,240
asked for rifles and whiskey?

1276
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,360
Yes. Lloyd said Mrs. Surratt asked him
to do all those things.

1277
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,840
Uh, excuse me?

1278
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,440
Did we not talk just yesterday?

1279
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,560
We did.

1280
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,160
And did you not say

1281
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,520
that Mrs. Surratt never asked for whiskey
or rifles of John Lloyd?

1282
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,760
I do not deny that.

1283
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,520
And now you're swearing,

1284
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,160
under oath,
that what you told me then was a lie.

1285
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,360
Yes. I lied to you 'cause I thought
you had no business to ask me.

1286
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,480
No business? I...

1287
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,680
You're my witness.

1288
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,160
Should I not expect the truth?

1289
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,640
I state here that I did lie to you,

1290
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:19,040
but under oath,
now I'm telling the truth.

1291
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,200
Mr. Holt, do you wish
to question the witness?

1292
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,240
Uh, no. I believe what we've heard
is more than sufficient.

1293
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,480
Captain, you may step down.

1294
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,040
As you know, tonight marks

1295
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,160
Washington's celebration
honoring our troops,

1296
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,480
so we will adjourn.

1297
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,400
It's not enough, is it, Mr. Holt?

1298
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,320
It's not enough that you, uh...

1299
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,360
you set the rules.
You... You pick the judges.

1300
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,440
Now you have to turn
my witness as well.

1301
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,640
Counselor, control yourself.

1302
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,360
Control the prosecution.

1303
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,360
Mr. Aiken.

1304
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,520
Every witness I wish to call has either
been turned by jail or the threat of it.

1305
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,520
That's enough!

1306
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,280
There is no limit to how far
the prosecution is willing to go!

1307
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,000
Stand down, counselor,
or I will hold you in contempt.

1308
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,720
You had better comport yourself
in a more appropriate manner,

1309
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,640
or you will find yourself
incarcerated with the others.

1310
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,680
Good evening.

1311
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,480
Good evening, Douglas.

1312
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,520
- Ma'am.
- Good evening.

1313
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,400
Mr. Aiken, may I have
a word with you?

1314
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,080
Of course.
Would you excuse me?

1315
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,120
MAN: His first day on the job.

1316
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Aiken.

1317
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,160
It's all right, Douglas.
It's not your fault.

1318
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,600
Frederick!

1319
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,040
Uh, Nick, would you escort Sarah
upstairs for me, please?

1320
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,400
Sure, but, uh...

1321
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,360
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

1322
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,160
Come on, Sarah.

1323
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:16,160
Even with one good leg,
I can still outdance him.

1324
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,160
Another night, Nick.

1325
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,080
Sarah.

1326
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,840
Sarah, where are you going?

1327
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,920
"Conduct unbecoming."

1328
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,400
I'm sorry about the party.

1329
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,600
You think I care about the party?

1330
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,360
Please. Everything will be all right.
I promise you.

1331
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,720
You are just like that woman,

1332
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,480
ready to go to the gallows
for the most pointless cause.

1333
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,560
People do get left behind
when you do that.

1334
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,400
I can't ignore what's going on
in that courtroom.

1335
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,640
But you can ignore me, us?

1336
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,400
I didn't say that.
Please, I have to do this.

1337
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,360
Do you?

1338
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,920
I find your devotion to this frightening.

1339
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,040
I waited such a long time for you.

1340
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,080
I'm so sorry.

1341
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,120
I know. But I'm back now.

1342
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,960
No, you're not.

1343
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,960
I am. I... ple...

1344
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,560
Sarah, please, will you just...

1345
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,800
We have to...
we have to talk about this.

1346
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,480
Fred, I love you. I...

1347
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,280
I wish I could do this.
I just... I can't.

1348
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,080
I just can't.

1349
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,960
Wait. Let me see you home at least.

1350
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,080
Please wait.

1351
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,520
Uh, Mr. Secretary.

1352
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,440
I have to speak with you.

1353
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,120
Mr. Aiken, perhaps this isn't
the best time.

1354
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,520
What is happening to Mary Surratt
is an abomination.

1355
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,560
Stand down, Captain.

1356
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,760
It's all right.

1357
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,680
Would you escort Mrs. Stanton in?

1358
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,280
I'll just be a moment.

1359
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,280
Yes, sir.

1360
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,080
Young man...

1361
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,760
always indebted to you
for your courage in the field,

1362
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,320
but you must learn to tread lightly.

1363
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,320
Tread lightly?

1364
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,880
I will not tread lightly.

1365
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,680
You have predetermined her fate.

1366
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,120
Mary Surratt's fate rests entirely
with the Commission.

1367
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,000
My concern is preserving our Union.

1368
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,280
Why did I fight for the Union
if my rights aren't assured?

1369
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,280
You tell me.

1370
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,560
Fine words for rallying the troops,
not for running a nation.

1371
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,560
They assassinated our president,

1372
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,760
and someone must be
held accountable.

1373
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,560
The people want that.

1374
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,040
It's John Surratt you want.
You don't even want Mary.

1375
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
I'll settle for either one.

1376
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,320
If you'll excuse me,
my wife is waiting.

1377
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,560
Mr. Aiken.

1378
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,080
May I come in?

1379
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,400
- It's late.
- I know.

1380
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,080
I need you to testify.

1381
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,480
Very well.

1382
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,000
I'll tell them my mother's innocent.

1383
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,160
I need you to tell them
that your brother is not.

1384
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,560
I won't do it.

1385
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,320
You know what'll happen
to her if you don't?

1386
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,760
Anna...

1387
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,000
Your brother does not need
to be saved right now.

1388
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,680
Your mother does.

1389
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,640
Mr. Aiken,

1390
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,760
are there any other
witnesses you wish to call?

1391
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,600
Uh, yes.

1392
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,480
The... The defense

1393
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,000
would like to call Miss Anna Surratt.

1394
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,640
General Hunter, what is...

1395
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,080
Place your right hand on this Bible.

1396
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,080
Where's my mother?

1397
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,400
Anna, she's just right here,

1398
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,160
behind these men.

1399
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,040
Why won't they let me see her?

1400
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,320
I don't know.

1401
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,120
Please, Miss Surratt.

1402
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,200
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

1403
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,080
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

1404
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,960
Miss Anna.

1405
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,280
I do.

1406
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,480
It'll be all right.

1407
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,040
Miss Surratt, can you tell us

1408
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,360
when your brother first became acquainted
with John Wilkes Booth?

1409
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,040
Miss Surratt, you will
answer the question.

1410
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,400
I believe my brother
met him January last.

1411
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,800
Three months before
the assassination.

1412
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,480
He must have been mighty pleased
to have befriended such a famous actor.

1413
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,760
You'll have to ask him.

1414
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,520
Well, I'm sure we'd all like to ask him.

1415
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,200
Your brother proudly called himself
a friend of Booth's, did he not?

1416
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,040
Mr. Aiken, what are you doing?

1417
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,000
Mother!

1418
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,400
Miss Surratt.
Miss Surratt, please.

1419
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,080
Miss Surratt.

1420
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,960
I never...

1421
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,680
asked what my brother's
relationship was to Booth.

1422
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,920
It was at John's invitation

1423
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,040
that he first came to your home,
was it not?

1424
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,120
Yes.

1425
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,480
Does this picture of Booth
belong to you?

1426
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,120
I found it in a gallery one day,
and I bought it.

1427
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,360
Your brother must have been pleased
that you held his friend in such high regard.

1428
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,720
- No.
- No?

1429
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,200
No. He told me to tear it up
and throw it away.

1430
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,240
Why?

1431
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,320
Why did your brother
tell you to destroy

1432
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,920
a photograph of his friend, Booth?

1433
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,600
No, Mr. Aiken!

1434
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,880
- Please.
- I beg of you.

1435
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,160
- Please.
- Order!

1436
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,160
Miss Surratt, please.

1437
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,080
Answer my question.

1438
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,200
I suppose he was trying to protect us.

1439
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,760
He was trying to protect
you and your mother?

1440
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,640
Yes.

1441
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,160
Why would he need
to protect his family?

1442
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,320
Anna, you have to choose.

1443
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:47,960
I suppose...

1444
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,400
he and Booth
were planning something.

1445
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,160
He was planning something.

1446
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,320
Did you know what?

1447
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,040
Of course not.

1448
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,800
When did you last see your brother?

1449
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,120
He left at the beginning of April.

1450
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,960
Days before the assassination.

1451
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,360
Did he tell you where he was going
or what he might be planning?

1452
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,160
He only said he had to leave.

1453
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,120
And did you or your mother
try to stop him?

1454
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,720
Yes.

1455
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,600
- But we couldn't.
- How could you? He was angry.

1456
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,200
He was frustrated with the war.

1457
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,240
He hated the Union.

1458
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,520
He would have done
anything in his power,

1459
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,600
even risk his own family
to aid Booth in his cause.

1460
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,360
But, Miss Surratt, did your mother conspire
with John Wilkes Booth?

1461
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,200
Absolutely not.

1462
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,120
Thank you.

1463
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,760
There are no more questions.

1464
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,720
General Hunter,
the government understands

1465
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,640
why Miss Surratt would be moved

1466
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,240
to the most extraordinary lengths
to conceal her mother's guilt,

1467
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,560
including incriminating
her own brother.

1468
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,760
My mother is innocent.

1469
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,040
Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.

1470
01:22:59,080 --> 01:22:59,880
The government no longer
deems it necessary to hold you.

1471
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,160
You are free to leave.

1472
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,680
I just want to see my mother.

1473
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,960
Please. I'm sorry, mother.

1474
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,480
I'm sorry.

1475
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,600
Please.
Please, let me see her.

1476
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,160
Sir, the defense would push
for the Commission

1477
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,080
to show some compassion
and allow a mother

1478
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,000
to see her daughter
for a brief moment only.

1479
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,840
We will reconvene in the morning.

1480
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,160
Frederick, it's me.

1481
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,120
Anna.

1482
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,760
What are you doing here?

1483
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,440
You never asked why
I had Booth's photo.

1484
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,880
Tear that up and throw it away.

1485
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,240
That man is gonna get us all
in trouble, if not worse.

1486
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,160
I should have thrown it away,

1487
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,880
but I didn't.

1488
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,760
So you were infatuated with Booth.

1489
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,760
I swear I didn't know
what he was capable of.

1490
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,520
I believe you.
But your brother did.

1491
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,320
Can you save my mother without him?

1492
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,280
Can you, Frederick?

1493
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,560
Probably not.

1494
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,520
Father Walter!

1495
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,760
Father?

1496
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,040
Will you excuse us for a minute?

1497
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,160
Counselor.

1498
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,680
I need to see John Surratt right away.

1499
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,040
Anna Surratt sent me.

1500
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,600
Well, as I told Miss Surratt,
I can only pass along a message.

1501
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,160
Where is he?

1502
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,560
I don't know.

1503
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,240
Only that some in the church have chosen
to provide him sanctuary.

1504
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,440
You don't seem troubled by their choice.

1505
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,560
You prefer he be crucified by this mob?

1506
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,600
John is hardly the Prince of Peace.

1507
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,360
He's wanted for murder and treason.

1508
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,200
Harboring him is not only immoral,
Father, it's illegal.

1509
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,160
Our laws are written here, counselor,
our allegiance to God.

1510
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:54,880
You forgive me, Father,

1511
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,240
but that's a bunch
of cock and bull.

1512
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,880
Bible bears as many interpretations
as anything else.

1513
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,440
Is there a message
you wish me to pass along?

1514
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,840
My case summary is tomorrow,

1515
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,960
so you tell John Surratt

1516
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,240
that unless he surrenders himself,

1517
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,680
his mother will most likely be
punished for his crimes.

1518
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,640
Mr. Aiken.

1519
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,600
For the lawyer as well as the soldier,

1520
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,000
there is an equally imperative command.

1521
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,440
That duty is to shelter from injustice
the innocent,

1522
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,520
to protect the weak from oppression

1523
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,520
and, when necessity demands,

1524
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:49,000
to rally to the defense
of those being wronged.

1525
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:55,400
After the most thorough investigation
in our nation's history,

1526
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,160
the government's entire case
against Mary Surratt

1527
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,160
rests on three acts...

1528
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,760
one,
her acquaintance with Booth,

1529
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,280
two,
her alleged instructions to Lloyd,

1530
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,560
and, three,
her nonrecognition of Payne.

1531
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,640
It is these three acts
that constitute the sum total

1532
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,800
of Mary Surratt's part in this traitorous
and murderous conspiracy.

1533
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,280
By themselves,
they constitute no crime.

1534
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,080
Any one of you or I
might have done the same,

1535
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,800
but the government insists
she did them with evil intent,

1536
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,360
largely based on the testimony of two men,

1537
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,440
John Lloyd
and Louis Weichmann.

1538
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,200
Yet, at best, the actions of these men
undermine their credibility,

1539
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,280
and, at worst,
they have done the unspeakable...

1540
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,200
they have gained their freedom

1541
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,600
by falsely accusing another
of their crime.

1542
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:49,280
There can be no doubt as
to the principal and real reason

1543
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,160
that Mary Surratt is here today.

1544
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,360
It's because of her son, John Surratt.

1545
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,840
He invited Booth into her home.
She did not.

1546
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,120
And he hid rifles and ammunition
in Lloyd's Tavern.

1547
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,560
She did not.

1548
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,600
If John Surratt was part
of this conspiracy,

1549
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,240
I pray to God that he receives
every punishment known to man,

1550
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,320
but if his mother can be convicted
on such insufficient evidence,

1551
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,960
I tell you none of you are safe.

1552
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,120
Members of the Commission,

1553
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,000
do not permit this injustice
to Mary Surratt

1554
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,720
by sacrificing our sacred rights
out of revenge.

1555
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,960
Too many of us have laid down
our lives to preserve them.

1556
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:45,880
Gentlemen.

1557
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:53,000
One bullet may have killed
our beloved president.

1558
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,640
One bullet, but not one man.

1559
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,760
Sit with me.

1560
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,680
Is there any word?

1561
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,840
No. They're still deliberating.

1562
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,400
I mean about my son.

1563
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,680
I held him too close.

1564
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,920
I didn't want John turning out
like his father,

1565
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,160
so I kept him near.

1566
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And when the war broke out,
he wanted to enlist,

1567
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,320
but I wouldn't let him.

1568
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,600
My son just needed to break free...

1569
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,600
be his own man.

1570
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,520
And this is the way he did it.

1571
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,440
All those in favor?

1572
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,040
Aye.

1573
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,960
Well, then, we are all agreed

1574
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,640
on the penalty of death
for the prisoners

1575
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,360
Herold, Atzerodt and Payne.

1576
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,560
What about the woman?

1577
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,640
Regarding Mary Surratt,

1578
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,560
all those in favor, gentlemen?

1579
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,920
No.

1580
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,680
Damn it!

1581
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,920
No.

1582
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,560
No, she must be punished
to the full extent.

1583
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,920
I want these people
buried and forgotten.

1584
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:08,120
The majority prefer
a more merciful sentence,

1585
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,200
life in prison
on account of her age, gender.

1586
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,800
I give Mr. Aiken credit.

1587
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,360
He knew just how
to use the daughter.

1588
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,480
It seems so.

1589
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,200
You made my sentiments known
to the Commission?

1590
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,680
Their minds are made.

1591
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,240
Then let us change them.

1592
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,080
"After mature consideration
of the evidence,

1593
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,480
"Commission finds you,
Mary E. Surratt,

1594

1603
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,160
Mary Surratt to meet her doom!

Here, sir.

1610
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,360
There must be something we can do.

1611
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,560
You have three options:

1612
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,960
Petition the president
for a stay of execution...

1613
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,480
but, uh, he won't do that,

1614
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,280
because if he did,
people would think

1615
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,800
he was part of the conspiracy.

1616
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,120
Uh, two, apply for
a writ of habeas corpus

1617
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,600
to retry her in a civilian court,

1618
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,480
but no judge would oppose Stanton

1619
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,720
or the might of the War Department.

1620
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,280
Uh, and, three, John Surratt

1621
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:35,960
shows himself before noon tomorrow.

1622
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,720
Are you going somewhere?

1623
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,880
I have business in Baltimore.

1624
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,880
What?

1625
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,800
You... You can't leave now!

1626
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,680
It's over.

1627
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,960
Freddie, she's not your mother.

1628
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,600
If John Surratt won't
give himself up for her,

1629
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,240
then why should you?

1630
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,600
Freddie!

1631
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,400
Frederick Sebastian Aiken,
we know you're in there!

1632
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,880
Open the door now. Come on.

1633
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,120
Fred... ah, there he is.

1634
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:16,280
Well, if it isn't
the reclusive Master Aiken.

1635
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,360
We thought you could use this.

1636
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,400
Hamilton, how well
do you know Judge Olin?

1637
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,400
What are you doing?

1638
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,200
You think he'll give me
a writ of habeas corpus?

1639
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,520
You can't pursue a writ.

1640
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,040
They won't allow me
to appeal this verdict,

1641
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,520
so I'm gonna appeal for a new trial.

1642
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,040
If you do this,
you will humiliate Stanton,

1643
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,440
and he will destroy you.

1644
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,880
The hell with Stanton.

1645
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,680
Why do you... Why do you insist
on standing by her?

1646
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,400
Hey. Hey, it makes no sense.

1647
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,960
What they're doing to her is wrong.

1648
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,440
If John Wilkes Booth himself
was tried in the same manner,

1649
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,720
it would still be wrong.

1650
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,080
Hamilton, she's to hang
in less than 12 hours.

1651
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,680
Judge Olin's out of town.

1652
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,280
He would have been my first choice.

1653
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,400
What about Wylie?

1654
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,760
Maybe Wylie.

1655
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,600
He's, uh- -he's always been known
as a Free Thinker.

1656
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,600
Yes. He's been around for ages,
but he was the closest to Lincoln.

1657
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,480
Then what about Carter?

1658
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,760
Not a chance. He was with Stanton
on the night of the assassination.

1659
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,640
Besides, they have dinner
together once a week.

1660
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,840
Then you're saying that Wylie
is my best option.

1661
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,320
No. Your best option is
to stop this nonsense

1662
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,960
and help us empty this bottle.

1663
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,600
Better listen to the man.

1664
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,760
Judge Wylie?

1665
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,760
I, uh... I need to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus.

1666
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,160
At this hour of the night?

1667
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,560
I'm sorry, sir. It can't wait.

1668
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,800
Interrupting an old man's sleep?

1669
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,840
I'd say you're getting off
on the wrong foot, son.

1670
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,120
It's for Mary Surratt.

1671
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,920
A new trial...

1672
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:05,480
in a civil court
by a jury of her peers.

1673
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,960
Is that what you want, Mr. Aiken?

1674
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,400
Yes, please, Your Honor.

1675
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:12,200
So we can relive our president's
assassination all over again.

1676
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:13,120
That's not my intention.

1677
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,720
Then to what intent?

1678
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,440
Might this not result
in exactly the same thing?

1679
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,320
Perhaps, but results should not be
our only measure of justice.

1680
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,720
Are you going
to lecture me on justice?

1681
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:25,720
Sorry, sir.

1682
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,120
You realize that I was personally
appointed by President Lincoln.

1683
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,120
Yes.

1684
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,400
And yet you still come to me.

1685
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,520
Forgive me, Your Honor,

1686
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,960
but are we not obligated
to follow the law at all times,

1687
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,520
regardless of our emotions?

1688
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,520
And is this not driven by emotions?

1689
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,600
Isn't that what this is all about?

1690
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:47,280
It's about preventing injustice.

1691
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,400
Now, I know that the people
are still angry.

1692
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,960
Yes, they are, and so am I.

1693
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,720
But I hope,
I trust that President Lincoln

1694
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,640
appointed you because you hold
the Constitution sacred.

1695
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,760
Whether you believe Mary Surratt
is guilty or innocent,

1696
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,240
the Constitution was intended...

1697
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,800
And now you're gonna
lecture me on the Constitution.

1698
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:08,440
...to protect the rights of all citizens
at all times in peace or war.

1699
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,000
And in a matter of hours,

1700
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,400
it will have failed to protect her
unless you sign that writ.

1701
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,040
You believe she's innocent?

1702
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,680
I don't know.

1703
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:23,440
But if we don't get a proper trial,
we never will.

1704
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,600
You can't go in there! Wait!

1705
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,520
I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I tried to stop him.

1706
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,560
It's all right.

1707
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,040
Good morning, Joseph.

1708
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,080
Good morning.

1709
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:53,320
It appears that Mr. Aiken has procured
a writ signed by Judge Wylie.

1710
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,480
Good day.

1711
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:57,200
Before you go, Captain,

1712
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:58,960
tell me...

1713
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:03,120
when you first learned
that our secretary of State

1714
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,600
had been butchered
to within an inch of his life

1715
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,560
and that they put a bullet in the back
of our president's head,

1716
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,160
when this city was in chaos,

1717
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,680
did you not wish to see order restored
and justice served,

1718
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,960
or were you just concerned
with the rights of the assassins?

1719
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,760
It's not justice you're after.
It's revenge.

1720
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:24,200
I would never go to such lengths
out of vengeance,

1721
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:29,160
but to ensure the survival of this nation,
I would do anything.

1722
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:34,880
Mary Surratt was a party
to the most grievous crime in our history.

1723
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:40,400
Necessity demands that she be given
a swift, sure and harsh sentence.

1724
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:44,520
I, too, hold sacred
our rights, counselor,

1725
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:49,680
but they count not at all
if our nation ceases to exist.

1726
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,440
Please see to it that Mary Surratt

1727
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,640
is delivered to Judge Wylie's courtroom
no later than noon...

1728
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,720
sir.

1729
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,400
Let's go. Come on. Stay there.

1730
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,040
You will have to stand trial again,

1731
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,720
but it will be a civilian trial.

1732
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,960
And a civilian trial has no generals.

1733
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,280
That's correct. No generals.

1734
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,560
Bless you, son.

1735
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,040
Bless you.

1736
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,520
Oh, Mama.

1737
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,520
Anna.

1738
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,280
Should only be three.

1739
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,680
It's time, ma'am.

1740
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:53,080
What are you doing?

1741
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,760
We need to prepare her
with the others.

1742
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,160
No. No, she is to be transferred
to Judge Wylie's court.

1743
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,400
I advise sedating the young lady.

1744
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,800
You'll do no such thing.

1745
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,600
Anna. I have procured a writ
that says she is to get a new trial.

1746
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,040
President just suspended your writ.

1747
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,120
I'm sorry.

1748
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,840
She's to hang with the others.

1749
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,840
No.

1750
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,880
No. Frederick, do something.

1751
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,720
I...

1752
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,800
I'm so sorry.

1753
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,240
Oh, no.

1754
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,680
No. No, no, no, no.

1755
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:31,960
No, Mama. No.
No, Mama. No.

1756
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,400
I'll always be with you.

1757
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,400
No! No!
Oh, Mama, no!

1758
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,600
I love you, Anna.
I love you.

1759
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,960
No!

1760
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Oh, God, no!

1761
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,360
Mama!

1762
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,920
Inter arma, silent leges.

1763
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:12,640
"In times of war,
the law falls silent."

1764
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,800
It shouldn't.

1765
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,280
Word is the last Confederate general
surrendered to Union troops.

1766
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,560
Peace.

1767
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,000
Peace at last.

1768
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,800
I am hereby commanded

1769
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,560
to cause David E. Herold,

1770
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,280
G. A. Atzerodt,

1771
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,960
Lewis Payne

1772
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,800
and Mary E. Surratt

1773
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,160
to be executed

1774
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:48,360
in accordance with the order of the president
of the United States,

1775
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,640
Andrew Johnson.

1776
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,080
The Almighty God bless you.

1777
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,560
Stand your prisoners up.

1778
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,000
Step them to the noose.

1779
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:28,480
Okay, sir.
I'll show you where he's at...

1780
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,840
No, I know the way.

1781
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,360
Mr. Aiken.

1782
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:55,640
I didn't think you'd come.

1783
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,080
I don't know what help
I can be to you.

1784
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,400
I've left the law.

1785
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,200
I just wanted to thank you

1786
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:04,640
for the kindness
that you showed my mother.

1787
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,680
Believe me, Mr. Aiken,

1788
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:09,640
I never thought they'd kill her.

1789
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,800
Father Walter asked
that I give you these.

1790
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,600
They were your mother's.

1791
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,000
I hope they can be
of some comfort to you.

1792
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,280
They belong to you.

1793
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:38,600
You were more of a son to her
than I ever was.

1794
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,760
Thank you.
