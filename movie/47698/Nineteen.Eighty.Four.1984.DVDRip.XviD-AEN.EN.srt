1
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,505
This is our land.

2
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,538
A land of peace and of plenty.

3
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,710
A land of harmony and hope.

4
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,849
This is our land.

5
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,720
Oceania.

6
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,018
These are our people.

7
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,493
The workers, the strivers, the builders.

8
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,303
These are our people.

9
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,973
The builders of our world, struggling...

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,206
fighting, bleeding...

11
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,881
dying.

12
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:27,583
On the streets of our cities
and on the far-flung battlefields.

13
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,653
Fighting against the mutilation
of our hopes and dreams.

14
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,930
Who are they?

15
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,633
Eurasia! Eurasia!

16
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,668
They are the dark armies.

17
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,538
The dark, murdering armies of Eurasia.

18
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,914
In the barren deserts of Africa and India...

19
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,285
on the oceans of Australasia...

20
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,843
courage, strength, and youth are sacrificed.

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:08,492
Sacrificed to barbarians,
whose only honor is atrocity.

22
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,433
But even as we grasp at victory...

23
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,602
there is a cancer, an evil tumor...

24
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,574
growing, spreading in our midst.

25
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,072
Shout, shout...

26
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,112
shout out his name!

27
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,507
Goldstein!

28
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,751
Nothing the Party says is true.

29
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,659
Nothing the Party does is good.

30
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,222
Even the war itself isn't real.

31
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,227
The Party wants you to believe
we are at war...

32
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,395
so as to channel your aggressions
away from their rightful target...

33
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,836
the Party.

34
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,071
Big Brother is not real.

35
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,242
He is pure fiction, created by the Party.

36
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,109
The real rulers of the State...

37
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,277
are unknown, faceless manipulators...

38
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,514
who, because they are not known...

39
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:13,114
are able to wield power
without let or hindrance.

40
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,529
People of Oceania, you are being duped.

41
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,866
The Party doesn't serve the people,
it serves itself.

42
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,734
We are not at war with Eurasia.

43
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,637
Death! Death! Traitor!

44
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,577
You are being made into obedient...

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,513
stupid slaves of the Party.

46
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,584
Open your eyes.

47
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,681
See the evil that is happening to you.

48
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,450
The Party drops bombs on its own citizens.

49
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,526
Traitor!

50
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:51,154
It is the Party, not the Eurasians,
who are our enemies.

51
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,194
Rise up.

52
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,463
Throw off the yoke.

53
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,464
You have nothing to lose,
and everything to gain.

54
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,873
People of Oceania.

55
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,601
Big, Big, Big....

56
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,608
Innuendo, deleted.

57
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,253
Intransigence, rendered as crime.

58
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,646
Inversion....

59
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,030
Back, Day One.

60
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,608
Ref. Times 14-2-84, Page 3,
Byline 2, should read:

61
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,676
"Miniprod Forecasts lncrease
Chocolate Ration, April, 1984...

62
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,552
"from 20 to 25 Grams Per Week."

63
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,475
I confess to spreading the rumor,
on orders from Goldstein...

64
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,674
that the war is not really with Eurasia,
but with Eastasia.

65
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:10,054
That, for years, in fact since the days
of our glorious Revolution...

66
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,283
I had no faith in our future.

67
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,793
I forged government announcements
and falsified figures...

68
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,127
quoted for agricultural
and industrial production.

69
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,836
As a result of mental disturbance from
my experiences during the atomic wars...

70
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,039
I was a willing subject
of Goldstein's influence.

71
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,277
I was stubborn and egocentric.

72
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,940
When ownlife thoughts occurred to me,
I reveled in them.

73
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,651
I went into the proletarian zones...

74
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:44,154
I had sex with prostitutes,
I deliberately contracted syphilis.

75
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,824
It was at this time
that I made contact with the Resistance.

76
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,492
I was personally contacted
by the archtraitor, Goldstein...

77
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,762
and ordered to assassinate
certain Inner Party officials.

78
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,893
Bugger!

79
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,335
This I did.

80
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,872
My agents forged documents
and gained entry into the Ministry....

81
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,877
"Thoughtcrime is death.

82
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,782
"Thoughtcrime does not entail death.

83
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,918
"Thoughtcrime is death.

84
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,719
"I have committed,
even before setting pen to paper...

85
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,387
"the essential crime
that contains all others in itself. "

86
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:27,364
I have spent many hours
of my free time, encouraging my agents...

87
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,867
to deface Party posters
and hoarding announcements.

88
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,638
I read and memorized Goldstein's book.

89
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,234
For 30 years,
I have plotted to bring down the Party.

90
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,804
I was sick in mind and body.

91
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,382
Together with my colleagues,
Aaronson and Rutherford...

92
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,947
I did counterfeit
important Party documents...

93
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,882
including ex-London permits
and travel passes.

94
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,022
And that by use of these documents...

95
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,561
my agents traveled freely
throughout Airstrip One...

96
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,125
encouraging insurrection
and organizing a massive counterplot...

97
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,934
to destroy the innermost faction
of the Oceanian leadership.

98
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,410
Furthermore...

99
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,415
I used my position of privilege
within the Inner Party...

100
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,219
to pervert and betray the truth at all times...

101
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,223
and to suggest, wherever possible,
that our traditional allies in Eastasia...

102
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,084
were in fact, our deadly enemies.

103
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,364
"April the 4th, 1984. "

104
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,160
In my position as Chief Factory Planner...

105
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,392
"I think... "

106
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,436
I stole military plans...

107
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,902
and, at vast financial profit,
sold them to the Eurasian leadership.

108
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,669
"... to the past...

109
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,175
"or to the future...

00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,225
"greetings!"

115
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,304
30-to-40 group, take your places, please.

116
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,781
Right, let's see which one of us
can touch his toes.

117
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,287
Right over from the hips,
brothers and sisters, please.

118
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,491
One, two.

119
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,064
Smith? 6079, Smith, W.?

120
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,174
Yes, you.

121
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,139
Bend lower.

122
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,543
You're not trying. Watch me.

123
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,579
There, brother. That's what I want.

124
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,752
Anyone under 45 is perfectly
capable of touching his toes.

125
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,529
I'm 39, and I've had four children.

126
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,895
We don't all have the privilege
of fighting in the front line.

127
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,492
Remember our boys on the Malabar Front.

128
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,400
Just think what they have to put up with.

129
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,942
Production of water-heaters
is up 1. 5 percent.

130
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,638
Switchgear, 4. 5 percent.

131
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,340
Electrical wiring, 10 percent.

132
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,852
Cigarettes, 18 percent.

133
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,352
Bricks, 3 percent.

134
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,214
Morning, Smith.

135
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,519
Parsons.

136
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,120
Heard the rumor?

137
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,922
No. Good news, is it?

138
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,999
I should say so, yes.

139
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,098
Choco rations going up.

140
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,528
Really?

141
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,031
Twenty-five grams next week.

142
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,806
Doubleplus good.

143
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,543
Speakwrites, 14 percent.

144
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,274
Vibra-aging castings, 9 percent.

145
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,882
By the way, Smith, I seem to have run out
of razor blades for some reason.

146
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,750
You wouldn't happen to have any spare,
would you?

147
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,347
I'm sorry, brother. I'm on the last one.

148
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,559
Bandages, 9 percent.

149
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,086
In 1983, Oceania's coal output...

150
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,598
reached 630 million tons.

151
00:13:55,534 --> 00:14:00,130
In 1976, coal output was 605 million tons...

152
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,768
an increase of 4. 1 percent.

153
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,203
5. 3 million tractors were produced...

154
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,447
an increase of 17. 6 percent.

155
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,045
6. 1 million trucks...

156
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,915
I wanted to ask you if you've got
any razor blades?

157
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,079
I've tried all over the place.

158
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,987
I've been using the same one for six weeks.

159
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,559
...a staggering increase of 93.4 percent.

160
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,429
Did you see the prisoners
hanged yesterday?

161
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,661
No, I was working.
But I shall see it on the screens.

162
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,612
You'll pick up the gin on the way?

163
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,086
I'll have two.

164
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:57,386
2.9 million Airstrip One
Mark 5 submachine guns...

165
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,596
3. 1 million Grenville gas-operated
light machine guns...

166
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,929
Give me a gin.

167
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:08,996
2.2 million.5 Victory
recoil-operated heavy machine guns...

168
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,369
6 million rifle grenades...

169
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,914
9 million Perry pineapple pin grenades...

170
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,808
and 1.4 million lightweight...

171
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,978
spigot-launching,
anti-tank rocket projectors.

172
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,116
Food production is also up...

173
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,318
-How's the Newspeak Committee?
-Working overtime.

174
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,620
...butter, 2 percent, milk, 6 percent.

175
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,392
Plusbig waste is in adjectives.

176
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,432
Plusbig problem is timing the language
to scientific advance.

177
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,003
It's a beautiful thing,
the destruction of words.

178
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,806
You won't have seen the Dictionary,
10th edition yet, Smith?

179
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,810
It's that thick.

180
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,183
The 11th edition will be that thick.

181
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,151
So the Revolution will be complete
when the language is perfect.

182
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:08,529
The secret's to move from translation,
to direct thought, to automatic response.

183
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,832
No need for self-discipline.
Language coming from here, not from here.

184
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,528
Excuse me for intruding.

185
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,076
You're saying that we'll be rid of
the last vestiges of Goldsteinism...

186
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,145
when the language has been cleaned.

187
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,646
-I couldn't agree with you more, brother.
-Absolutely.

188
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,714
Praise be to our leader
and the Party workers!

189
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,254
Other munitions production figures
are as follows.

190
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,162
70, 000 M-20 tank destroyers...

191
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,292
with 76-mm cannon.

192
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,731
Smith. Syme.

193
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,575
It's encouraging to think that by 2050...

194
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,581
not a single person will be able
to have a conversation like this.

195
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,044
Except the proles?

196
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,676
The proletariat don't count. They're animals.

197
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,284
See the hanging?

198
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,347
Missed it, myself.

199
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,119
Bloody committees.

200
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:16,393
35,000 Black Eagle 500 cc motorbicycles.

201
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,402
Doubleplus good, this.

202
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:26,076
You know, I don't think
there's a single piece of meat in this stew.

203
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,081
Looks like meat. Tastes like meat.

204
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,610
It isn't meat at all.

205
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,442
Doubleplus good.

206
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,213
Not like it, Smith?

207
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,347
Yes, it's too rich for me.

208
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,521
Do you mind if l....

209
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,860
Brothers and sisters,
the battle for production has been won.

210
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,932
Completed returns
show that the standard of living...

211
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,197
has risen by no less than 20 percent
over the last year.

212
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:57,341
All over Oceania there've been spontaneous
demonstrations of Party workers...

213
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,809
voicing their gratitude and joy!

214
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:05,049
In honor of this massive overfulfillment
of the ninth three-year plan...

215
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,053
it's been announced that chocolate ration
is to be increased to 25 grams per week!

216
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,492
"If there is hope...

217
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,766
"it lies in the proles.

218
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,533
"If they could become conscious
of their own strength...

219
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,300
"they would have no need to conspire.

220
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,905
"History does not matter to them.

221
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,553
"It was three years ago...

222
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,587
"on a dark evening.

223
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,595
"Easy to slip the patrols.

224
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,793
"And I'd gone into the proletarian areas.

225
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,636
"There was no one else in the street,
and no telescreens.

226
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,678
"She said, '$2. '

227
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,145
"So I went with her.

228
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,519
"She had a young face...

229
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,417
"painted very thick.

230
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,530
"It was really the paint that appealed to me...

231
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,931
"the whiteness of it, like a mask...

232
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,737
"and the bright red lips. "

233
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,102
Come on.

234
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,515
"There were no preliminaries.

235
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:59,890
"Standing there, with the scent
of dead insects and cheap perfume...

236
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,831
"I went ahead and did it, just the same. "

237
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,660
Rutherford unperson.

238
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,559
Substitute Ogilvy.

239
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,800
Ogilvy bio, details as follows:

240
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,935
"War hero.

241
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,671
"Recently killed, Malabar Front.

242
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,372
"Today awarded posthumous
Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second Class."

243
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,050
I accuse myself of sabotage...

244
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,057
embezzlement of Party funds...

245
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,755
sale of military secrets...

246
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,957
of being in the pay
of the Government of Eurasia...

247
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,558
of being a sexual pervert
and a thoughtcriminal.

248
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,034
I exploited my trusted position
at the Ministry of Peace...

249
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,836
to mislead our allies in Eastasia...

250
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:58,372
and also to corrupt youth by means
of seditious literature and drugs.

251
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,982
I am guilty on all counts.

252
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,352
I stand here...

253
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,551
a victim of the influence of....

254
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,220
"Under the spreading chestnut tree...

255
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,161
"I sold you...

256
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,355
"you sold me. "

257
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,027
And I ask only...

258
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,366
for you to accept...

259
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,238
my love of our leader.

260
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,928
Can I help you?

261
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,738
Anything special?

262
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,176
I was here before.

263
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,116
Razor blades.

264
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,654
You sold me the notebook.

265
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,780
Yes.

266
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,955
Please look around.

267
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,986
What's this?

268
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,221
It's a beautiful thing.

269
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,888
Over 100 years old.

270
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,462
Cost you $4.

271
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,977
There's another room upstairs
that you might like to see.

272
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,447
But there's not much in it.

273
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,186
Just a few things.

274
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,419
My woman's dead.

275
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,892
I'm just trying to sell the furniture.

276
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,867
It's a beautiful bed...

277
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,706
if you can get the bugs out of it.

278
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,517
Interested in old prints at all?

279
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,598
The frame's fixed to the wall,
but I daresay I could unscrew it.

280
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,826
How did this escape?

281
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,362
I know what it is.

282
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,768
It's the museum in the street
outside the Palace of Justice.

283
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,668
"'Oranges and lemons,'
say the bells of St. Clement's."

284
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,547
What was that?

285
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,184
Something old.

286
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,578
War is peace!

287
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,444
Freedom is slavery!

288
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,115
Ignorance is strength!

289
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,059
A triumph of willpower over the orgasm.

290
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,562
At a rally of the Anti-Sex League
in Victory Square tonight...

291
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,533
held to celebrate a 50-percent decrease
in civil marriages...

292
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:54,069
over 10, 000 Party women
took a vow of celibacy...

293
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,471
and pledged themselves as vessels
for the artificial insemination....

294
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,042
"I hate her.

295
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,511
"I should kill her before she denounces me.

296
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,543
"I have disliked her
from the first moment of seeing her. "

297
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,849
Sector 43...

298
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,816
929 male...

299
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,552
753 female.

300
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,222
Sector 44...

301
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,090
437 male...

302
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,621
609 female.

303
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,596
Sector 45...

304
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,701
222 male...

305
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,463
220 female.

306
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,703
Sector 46....

307
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,002
-Are you hurt?
-It's nothing.

308
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,544
It's my arm.

309
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,009
I'll be all right in a second.

310
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,045
Brother, could you....

311
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,487
Are you all right?

312
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,162
It's nothing.

313
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,757
I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang.

314
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,565
Thank you, brother.

315
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,863
Who is she?

316
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,928
All I know is that she works
in the corner section...

317
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,495
probably on the proletarian
novel-writing machines.

318
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,645
Mrs. Parsons? A spanner?

319
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,779
Under the sink, beside you.

320
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,806
Thank you, brother.

321
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,738
I wouldn't have had to bother you,
but my husband's out late.

322
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,581
Committees.

323
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,218
You know what us Parsons are like.

324
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,614
You're a thoughtcriminal.

325
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,423
They haven't been out much.

326
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,692
Thank you, brother.

327
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,198
Attention! Your attention, please!

328
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:20,230
A newsflash has this moment arrived
from the Malabar Front.

329
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:24,705
The forces of Oceania in South India
have won a glorious victory.

330
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,604
I am authorized to say
that the war against Eurasia...

331
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,546
is within measurable distance of its end.

332
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,050
40, 000 Eurasian soldiers
have been killed or captured.

333
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,367
Can you hear me?

334
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:34,969
Yes.

335
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,978
Do you have an ex-London permit?

336
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:39,707
Yes.

337
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,784
Can you get Sunday afternoon off?

338
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:45,513
Yes.

339
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,987
Take this.

340
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,159
It's quite precise. I rely on you to destroy it.

341
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,392
Are you sure you can come?

342
00:33:58,903 --> 00:33:59,961
Yes.

343
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,252
On your own, brother?

344
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,958
No, I'm joining the Vic Mans
community hiking group.

345
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,265
I was held up on urgent Minrec business.

346
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,074
Sing to the bravest on the sturdy fortress

347
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:21,675
Sing to the soldiers on the battlefields

348
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:26,184
Sing to the airmen in the burning azure

349
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:30,383
Sing to the farmers' rising yields

350
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:35,229
We are the children, builders of the future

351
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:39,768
And we the children swear to thee

352
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,408
Loyal devotion, fearless devotion

353
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,775
And to die with dignity

354
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,039
Sing to the faithful....

355
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,449
A daring and resourceful maneuver...

356
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,388
under the personal direction
of B.B. himself...

357
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,393
ensuring the total annihilation of
the Eurasian heavy-armored divisions....

358
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,196
Look.

359
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,013
It's a dream.

360
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,317
I want you.

361
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,683
Not here.

362
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,026
Come back to the woods, it's safer.

363
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,309
Have you done this before?

364
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,873
Of course.

365
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,372
Hundreds of times.

366
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,913
-With Party members?
-Yes.

367
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,411
Inner Party members?

368
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,545
Not with those bastards.
Though there's plenty who would.

369
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,124
Look, I hate purity.

370
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,826
I hate goodness.

371
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,956
I don't want virtue to exist anywhere.

372
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,328
I want everyone corrupt.

373
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,458
I ought to suit you, then.

374
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,137
I'm corrupt to the core.

375
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,504
Do you like doing this?

376
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,872
I don't mean just me.

377
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,042
I adore it.

378
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,142
Winston?

379
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,182
We shall meet in the place
where there is no darkness.

380
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,801
Adult literacy amongst the proletariat
has risen by 56 percent.

381
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:39,675
The proletarian infant mortality rate
has dropped by 12 percent.

382
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:45,146
Incidences of leukemia, tuberculosis,
and meningitis have dropped considerably.

383
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:50,381
Improved diet has been responsible
for a dramatic decrease in rickets.

384
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,185
Eye diseases show a steep drop.

385
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,684
So, too, do deaths
from pneumonia and smallpox.

386
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,058
The improvement in
sewerage and drainage systems...

387
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,597
has resulted in better health, overall.

388
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,497
State rodent operatives
report a 50-percent reduction...

389
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:11,233
in the number of vermin
in the central proletarian zones.

390
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,903
I just want to finish by saying a few words...

391
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:19,210
about the impact
of this imminent neurological breakthrough.

392
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,781
When the orgasm
has been finally eradicated...

393
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,989
the last remaining obstacle
to the psychological acceptance...

394
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,461
of the principles of lngsoc,
as applied to artsem, will be overcome.

395
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,793
In other words, the unorthodox tendencies
towards ownlife...

396
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,801
which constantly threaten
the natural erosion of the family unit...

397
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,904
will no longer have
the biological support of the organism.

398
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,438
As we all know, the biological and
social stimulation of the family leads to...

399
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,842
private reflection, outside Party needs...

400
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,516
and to the establishment
of unorthodox loyalties...

401
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,249
which can only lead to thoughtcrime.

402
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:05,391
The introduction of artsem, combined
with the neutralization of the orgasm...

403
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,488
will effectively render obsolete the family...

404
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,999
until it becomes impossible
to conceptualize.

405
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,231
Thank you.

406
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,747
Excuse me, brother.

407
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,950
You dropped your ink pencil.

408
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,850
Thank you, sister.

409
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,027
A pincer movement has developed...

410
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:48,127
involving the floating fortresses
of the Eurasian 17th Fleet...

411
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,186
Not much.

412
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,395
Not much left at all, these days.

413
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,093
Walls.

414
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,263
Police don't like us much.

415
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,304
That room...

416
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,573
how much?

417
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,339
$4 a week.

418
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,031
Traitor!

419
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,743
Traitor! Criminal!

420
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,241
Big, Big, Big....

421
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,078
A vast military buildup
of armored divisions...

422
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,918
missiles and floating fortresses,
accompanied by a fourfold increase...

423
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,957
in the number of
radio-controlled rocket bombs...

424
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:56,089
directed at the most
densely populated areas of Airstrip One....

425
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,669
It is folly...

426
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,970
as though deliberately,
we move one step nearer the grave.

427
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,943
I can't understand why
she accepted the idea...

428
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,780
she, who is so careful.

429
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:24,719
Hello.

430
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,862
Let me show you what I've brought.

431
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,435
Look.

432
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,212
What is it?

433
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,548
Real sugar.

434
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,286
Not saccharin.

435
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,553
And I've got a loaf of bread,
proper white bread...

436
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,089
and jam.

437
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,025
A real tin of milk.

438
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,926
Look.

439
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,399
Coffee.

440
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,408
Real coffee.

441
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,047
Inner Party. Half a kilo.

442
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,349
How did you manage
to get ahold of all this?

443
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,250
There's nothing those bastards don't have.

444
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,016
Aren't you pleased?

445
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,150
Yes.

446
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,425
Of course.

447
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,065
Real tea.

448
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,402
There's been a lot of tea about lately.

449
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,999
They've captured lndia or something.

450
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,877
I want you.

451
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,647
I want you, too.

452
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:56,476
Wait.

453
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,584
Turn around, and don't look until I tell you.

454
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,734
Listen to that.

455
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,048
How can she make a song
written by a machine sound so beautiful?

456
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,991
You can turn around now.

457
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,801
-l....
-Winston....

458
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,773
Do you like me?

459
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,478
More than ever.

460
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,799
Was there ever a time
when this seemed ordinary?

461
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,573
Attention! Your attention, please!

462
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:38,711
A vast military buildup
has been reported in the Sahara Desert...

463
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,789
sectors 17 and 18 of the war zone.

464
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,718
14 heavy-tank divisions....

465
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,630
"There is truth, and there is untruth. "

466
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:52,724
...have been sighted proceeding in convoy
in a northerly direction....

467
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,167
"Freedom...

468
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:57,872
"is the freedom to say
two plus two equals four.

469
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,771
"If that is granted...

470
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,038
"all else follows. "

471
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,011
That is the end of the announcement.

472
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:10,619
We'll rehab the war from a neutral zone,
remaking dust in interstate plusplan levels.

473
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:14,984
Intend ego 1980 level
in dust output by 48 percent.

474
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,717
Stop, end emission.

475
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,534
Re: Times, 31-10-81.

476
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:14,848
Brother Tillotson wins Mini chess.
Request photo. File follows.

477
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:44,112
Attention. Your attention, please.

478
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,579
Will all Outer Party members
of Ways and Means Committees...

479
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:51,780
please attend their local
community centers for discussions and....

480
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,413
"Under the spreading chestnut tree...

481
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,455
"I sold you, you sold me. "

482
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,356
The meetings begin at 20: 00 hours.

483
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:09,865
Smith?

484
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,239
I've been reading
your Newspeak articles in The Times.

485
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,603
Yes.

486
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,313
You write very elegantly.
That is not my own opinion.

487
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,617
I was recently talking to a friend of yours,
who is an expert.

488
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,588
His name has slipped my memory
for a moment.

489
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:32,826
What I wanted to say was, that there were
one or two unwords, only very recent.

490
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,358
Have you seen the 10th edition
of the Newspeak Dictionary?

491
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,862
No, we're still using
the 9th edition at Minrec.

492
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:45,173
A few advance copies
have been segregated. I have one myself.

493
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,474
You might be interested.

494
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,603
Yes.

495
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,183
There are some plus skillful
new developments.

496
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,677
Let me give you my address.

497
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,014
I'm usually at home in the evenings.

498
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:05,151
If not, my servant
will give you the dictionary.

499
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,572
14,000 Victory Vampires...

500
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,477
6, 700 Ingsoc cadets...

501
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,909
4,600 Ingsoc sea cadets...

502
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:30,050
12,300 Porteous piloted missiles...

503
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,350
31,000 Victory fighter bombers...

504
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,549
23,000 Big Brother heavy bombers.

505
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,785
"It has happened at last.

506
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,123
"The call has come.

507
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:46,062
"It seems that all my life...

508
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,034
"I've been waiting for it. "

509
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,472
...is to be named after
Sub-lieutenant Ogilvy...

510
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,976
hero of the State of Oceania...

511
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:59,846
recently awarded, posthumously,
the Order of Conspicuous Gallantry...

512
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,885
for his action
in the recent glorious victory...

513
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:07,047
over the forces of Eastasia
on the Malabar Front, in South India.

514
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,680
Half the water's boiled away.

515
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,593
What does the clock say?

516
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,092
It says 21 :00 hours.

517
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,162
What time do they cut the light
in your flats?

518
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,363
23:30.

519
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,240
At the hostel it's 23:00.

520
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,211
What is it?

521
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,082
I don't know.

522
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:11,876
A little chunk of history
that they've forgotten to alter.

523
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,681
Message from 100 years ago.

524
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,936
"'Oranges and lemons,'
say the bells of St. Clement's."

525
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,702
"'You owe me three farthings,'
say the bells of St. Martin's."

526
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,471
Who taught you that? What is it?

527
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,748
I don't know. I just know it.

528
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,189
You know, the only thing to do...

529
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:52,523
is to walk out of here before it's too late...

530
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,927
and never see one another again.

531
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:57,190
Yes.

532
00:53:58,101 --> 00:53:59,830
Our luck can't last.

533
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,273
You're young...

534
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,975
you look normal, you're innocent.

535
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,605
You keep clear of people like me,
and you might stay alive.

536
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,848
What you do, I do.

537
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,415
I've thought it out.

538
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,416
I'm good at staying alive.

539
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,841
When shall we meet again?

540
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,836
Not for several weeks. It's not safe.

541
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,482
Give me half an hour.

542
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,219
I love you.

543
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,492
Julia....

544
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,638
Do you think the Resistance is real?

545
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,497
No.

546
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,433
None of it's real.

547
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,943
Steamer! Dead overhead! Get down!

548
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:49,030
...round the clock, plus a 153 sets
in eyes top a P.M.A. Willmer.

549
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,873
"Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

550
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:58,146
"Oceania has always been
at war with Eastasia.

551
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,483
"Eurasia is our ally.
Eurasia has always been our ally.

552
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,346
"Everything fades into mist.

553
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,116
"The past is erased, the erasure forgotten.

554
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,689
"A lie becomes truth
and then becomes a lie again. "

555
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,033
What is it?

556
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,439
I dreamt...

557
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,008
about my mother.

558
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,552
What, darling?

559
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,069
It was during the wars...

560
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,903
before the Party.

561
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,885
Winston!

562
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,435
I couldn't help myself.

563
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,409
I knew what I had done...

564
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,403
and I couldn't help myself.

565
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,262
When I went back, hours later...

566
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,136
my mother and sister were gone.

567
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,042
I never saw them again.

568
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:55,780
So it's not just staying alive.

569
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,724
It's staying human that's important.

570
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,365
What counts...

571
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,860
is that we don't betray each other.

572
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:10,162
If you mean confessing,
we're bound to do that.

573
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,172
Everybody does.

574
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,242
You can't help it.

575
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,879
I don't mean confessing.

576
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,271
Confessing isn't betrayal.

577
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,742
I mean feelings.

578
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,685
If they can make me change my feelings...

579
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,791
they can stop me from loving you.

580
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,056
That will be real betrayal.

581
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:40,863
They can't do that.

582
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,570
It's the one thing they can't do.

583
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,806
They can torture you...

584
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,668
and make you say anything.

585
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,116
But they can't make you believe it.

586
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,377
They can't get inside you.

587
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,615
They can't get to your heart.

588
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,996
I'm going to see O'Brien.

589
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:09,958
I know.

590

Davis, Miniprod, Women's Section.

612
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,751
That concludes the list
of known agents of Goldstein...

613
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,624
actively engaged in the latest conspiracy....

614
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:50,062
Not much of this gets
to the Outer Party, I'm afraid.

615
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:53,025
To our leader.

616
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:57,072
...that our eternal allies in Eurasia
are turning against us.

617
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:02,507
More nests of conspirators
and saboteurs have been uncovered...

618
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,376
and further arrests are expected shortly.

619
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,011
You can....

620
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:18,084
Yes. We are allowed that privilege.

621
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,388
Some more of this?

622
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,590
It's called wine.

623
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:41,714
There are thoughtcriminals
who maintain the Resistance is not real.

624
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,883
Believe me, Winston...

625
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,112
it is very real.

626
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:52,058
Perhaps you are not familiar
with how it operates.

627
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,493
I'm attentive to the news.

628
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,691
Indeed.

629
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,366
Perhaps you imagine
a huge network of conspirators...

630
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,199
prepared to commit
any atrocity to demoralize...

631
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,740
and weaken the order of our society.

632
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,869
The reality is infinitely more subtle.

633
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,878
If Goldstein himself...

634
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:18,419
fell into the hands of the Thought Police,
he could not give them a list of his agents.

635
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,080
Such a list does not exist.

636
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,022
They're not an organization
in the sense we know.

637
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,726
Nothing holds it together but an idea.

638
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,465
There is no possibility of change
in their lifetime.

639
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,265
In the face of the Thought Police...

640
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,531
they cannot act collectively.

641
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,201
Individually, they cheat...

642
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,876
forge, blackmail, corrupt children...

643
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,281
spread disease and prostitution...

644
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,784
in the name of spreading knowledge
from generation to generation.

645
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,252
Until...

646
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,759
in a thousand years....

647
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,898
You may find this of interest.

648
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,443
Thank you.

649
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:33,024
...address a rally in Victory Square
at 21:30 hours.

650
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,421
That is the end of the announcement.

651
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,494
Goodbye, brother.

652
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:56,111
They have attacked an unarmed village
with rocket bombs...

653
01:05:56,218 --> 01:06:00,154
and murdered 4, 000 defenseless, innocent...

654
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:03,157
and peaceful citizens of Oceania.

655
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,159
This is no longer war.

656
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,458
This is cold-blooded murder.

657
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:15,137
Until now, the war has been conducted
with honor...

658
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,766
and bravery...

659
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:21,366
with the ideals of truth and justice,
in the best traditions of mankind...

660
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,105
until this moment.

661
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,414
Brothers and sisters...

662
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:32,318
the endless catalogue of bestial atrocities...

663
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,254
which will inevitably ensue
from this appalling act...

664
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,794
must, can, and will be terminated.

665
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,860
The forces of darkness
and treasonable maggots...

666
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:49,131
who collaborate with them,
must, can, and will...

667
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,168
be wiped from the face of the earth.

668
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,366
We must crush them.

669
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,445
We must smash them.

670
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,376
We must stamp them out.

671
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,908
We, the people of Oceania...

672
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:11,284
... will not rest until a final victory
has been achieved.

673
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,522
Death to the eternal enemy of Oceania.

674
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,767
Death!

675
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,340
Brothers and sisters...

676
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,210
one week from now...

677
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,945
in this very square...

678
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:38,116
we shall,
as a demonstration of our resolve...

679
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,957
as a sure sign to those
who attempt to threaten...

680
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,026
our Party and our State...

681
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,088
we shall execute publicly...

682
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:50,461
the same number of Eastasian prisoners...

683
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:54,093
by hanging, drawing and quartering.

684
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,135
Big, Big, Big....

685
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:48,584
"In accordance to the principles
of Doublethink...

686
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,352
"it does not matter if the war is not real...

687
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,429
"or when it is, that victory is not possible.

688
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:59,063
"The war is not meant to be won.
It is meant to be continuous.

689
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:02,470
"The essential act of modern warfare...

690
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:05,699
"is the destruction of the produce
of human labor.

691
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:11,439
"A hierarchical society is only possible
on the basis of poverty and ignorance.

692
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,943
"ln principle,
the war effort is always planned...

693
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,952
"to keep society on the brink of starvation.

694
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:24,055
"The war is waged by the ruling group
against its own subjects.

695
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,256
"And its object is not victory
over Eurasia or Eastasia...

696
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,990
"but to keep the very structure
of society intact. "

697
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,800
Julia?

698
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,543
Are you awake?

699
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,892
There is truth, and there is untruth.

700
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:10,062
To be in a minority of one
doesn't make you mad.

701
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,636
Julia, my love...

702
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,239
I understand how.

703
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:24,049
I don't understand why.

704
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:49,274
I'm hungry.

705
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:53,606
Let's make some more coffee.

706
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:12,794
The water's cold.

707
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,840
There's no oil in it.

708
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,041
That's strange. I thought it was full.

709
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:36,657
They say that time heals all things

710
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:43,397
They say you can always forget

711
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:49,637
But the smiles and the tears

712
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:53,535
across the years

713
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:59,071
they twist my heartstrings yet.

714
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:00,705
She's beautiful.

715
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,624
She's a meter across the hips. Easily.

716
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:12,226
It's her style of beauty.

717
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,294
The future is hers.

718
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,334
We are the dead.

719
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,071
We are the dead.

720
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,708
You are the dead.

721
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,314
Remain exactly where you are.

722
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,056
Make no move until you are ordered.

723
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,854
Now they can see us.

724
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,694
Now we can see you.

725
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,968
Clasp your hands behind your heads.

726
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,963
Stand out in the middle of the room.
Stand back-to-back.

727
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,643
Do not touch one another.

728
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,240
The house is surrounded.

729
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,248
The house is surrounded.

730
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:12,113
I suppose we may as well say goodbye.

731
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,452
You may as well say goodbye.
While we're on the subject...

732
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,321
"Here comes a candle to light you to bed.

733
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:21,525
"Here comes a chopper
to chop off your head. "

734
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,670
Pick that up.

735
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,921
Thought Police.

736
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,754
6079 Smith. Open your eyes.

737
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,387
Parsons.

738
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,928
Keep away from me, Smith.

739
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,966
I'm an agent of Goldstein.

740
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:19,473
I didn't know it myself.

741
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,811
Thoughtcrime is so insidious.

742
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,750
It just creeps up on you.

743
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,593
My daughter found it out.

744
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,956
Very proud of her.

745
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:47,930
Very grateful I've been discovered
before it's too late.

746
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,567
They won't shoot me, will they, Smith?

747
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,705
I know I could be very useful
in a labor camp.

748
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,586
Room 101.

749
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,335
No.

750
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:25,397
Please, you don't have to take me there.

751
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:27,909
Why?

752
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,975
There's nothing I won't confess.

753
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,240
Nothing.

754
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,777
I've told you everything already.

755
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,651
What is it you want me to know?

756
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,590
Take him instead of me.

757
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,995
He's the thoughtcriminal. It's him you want.

758
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,676
They got you, too.

759
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,545
They got me a long time ago.

760
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:51,582
You knew this would happen, Winston.

761
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:54,719
Don't deceive yourself.
You've always known it.

762
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:16,510
The photos of you and the girl
will be recycled for proletarian use.

763
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,559
Do you know where you are, Winston?

764
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:02,328
I don't know.

765
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:04,963
I can guess.

766
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,335
In the Ministry of Love.

767
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:11,931
Do you know how long you've been here?

768
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:13,531
No.

769
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:16,069
Weeks?

770
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,439
Months?

771
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,014
Do you know why you're here?

772
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,284
Shall I tell you why we brought you here?

773
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,455
To cure you.

774
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,718
To make you sane.

775
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,803
That was 40.

776
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:49,365
You can see that the numbers
on this dial run up to 100.

777
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:53,513
Will you please remember
that, during our conversation?

778
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:57,278
I have it in my power
to inflict pain on you at any time...

779
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:59,751
and in whatever degree I choose.

780
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:10,194
You know perfectly well
what is the matter with you, Winston.

781
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:14,494
You've known it for years, though
you've fought against the knowledge.

782
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,594
You are mentally deranged.

783
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,739
You suffer from a defective memory.

784
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,576
You never tried to cure yourself of it,
because you did not choose to.

785
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:28,949
It was a small effort of will,
which you were not ready to make.

786
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,486
For example...

787
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:36,352
which power is Oceania at war with?

788
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,625
Eastasia.

789
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:44,196
Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

790
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,595
Eastasia.

791
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:48,461
Good.

792
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,801
And Oceania has always been at war
with Eastasia, has it not?

793
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:58,207
Tell me what you think you remember.

794
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:05,012
I remember...

795
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:09,981
that until only a week
before I was arrested...

796
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:13,453
we weren't at war with Eastasia at all.

797
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,753
It was Eurasia.

798
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,462
That lasted four years, I think.

799
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,093
Another example.

800
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:25,330
A serious delusion.

801
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:30,507
Photographs about which
you've had hallucinations...

802
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:34,210
which you believed you held in your hand.

803
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,246
They never existed.

804
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,193
Say what you were about to say, Winston.

805
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,730
They exist...

806
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:53,664
in memory.

807
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,069
I remember.

808
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:00,106
You remember.

809
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,170
I do not remember.

810
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,006
Only the disciplined mind
can see reality, Winston.

811
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:12,586
It needs an act of self-destruction...

812
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,377
an effort of the will.

813
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,955
Do you remember writing in your diary:

814
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:22,052
"Freedom is the freedom to say
two plus two equals four"?

815
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,256
Yes.

816
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,066
How many fingers am I holding up?

817
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,694
Four.

818
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:34,699
And if the Party says there are not four,
but five, then how many?

819
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,035
Five.

820
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,309
No.

821
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,312
That's no use. You're lying.

822
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:53,187
How many fingers, please?

823
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:59,295
Four. What else could I say?

824
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:05,269
Five, or anything you like.
Will you please stop it?

825
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:08,398
Stop the pain.

826
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,475
How can I help it?

827
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:20,715
How can I help
what I see in front of my eyes?

828
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,624
Two and two makes four.

829
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,522
Sometimes, Winston.

830
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:31,697
Sometimes they are five,
sometimes they are three.

831
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:35,495
Sometimes they are all of them at once.

832
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:49,039
Neither the past, nor the present,
nor the future...

833
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,619
exists in its own right.

834
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,648
Reality is in the human mind...

835
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,085
not in the individual mind...

836
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:02,160
which makes mistakes and soon perishes...

837
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:06,129
but in the mind of the Party...

838
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:10,100
which is collective and immortal.

839
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:15,840
-Again.
-No.

840
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:25,709
How many fingers, Winston?

841
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:29,114
Four.

842
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,822
Four, I suppose there are four.

843
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,558
I tried to see five.

844
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,890
I wish I could.

845
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,262
Which do you wish?

846
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:44,065
To persuade me that you can see five,
or really to see them?

847
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,301
Really to see them.

848
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,102
Again.

849
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:00,779
How many, Winston?

850
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,067
I don't know.

851
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,200
Better.

852
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:42,159
No one escapes, Winston.
There are no martyrs here.

853
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,227
All the confessions made here are true.

854
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:51,034
We do not destroy the heretic
because he resists us.

855
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,066
As long as he resists us,
we never destroy him.

856
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:59,170
We make him one of ourselves
before we kill him.

857
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:03,175
We make his brain perfect
before we blow it out.

858
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,716
And then...

859
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:10,814
when there is nothing left
but sorrow and love of Big Brother...

860
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:14,354
we shall lift you clean out of history.

861
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:18,796
We shall turn you into gas
and pour you into the stratosphere.

862
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,702
Nothing will remain of you.

863
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,271
Not a name in a register.

864
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:27,271
Not a memory in a living brain.

865
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:32,275
You will be annihilated in the past,
as well as in the future.

866
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:35,843
Three thousand.

867
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:46,351
This time it won't hurt you.

868
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:51,360
Before we bring this session to an end...

869
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,468
I want you to ask me your questions.

870
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,997
I want you to clear your mind.

871
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:01,633
Julia.

872
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,477
She betrayed you, Winston...

873
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,877
immediately, unreservedly.

874
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:12,483
All her rebellion, deceit,
folly, dirty-mindedness...

875
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:14,612
has been turned out of her.

876
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,126
Does Big Brother exist?

877
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,392
Of course.

878
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,728
The same way as me?

879
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,362
You do not exist.

880
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:38,440
You've not asked me the question
that is uppermost in your mind.

881
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:41,675
You know what is in Room 101.

882
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:45,818
Everyone knows what's in Room 101.

883
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:51,684
Now...

884
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,658
fix your eyes on mine.

885
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:14,609
What country is Oceania at war with?

886
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:19,878
I don't remember.

887
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,179
Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

888
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:25,688
Do you remember that now?

889
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:26,885
Yes.

890
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:31,129
How many fingers am I holding up?

891
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:34,158
Five.

892
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:38,230
You see, at least, that it is possible.

893
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:45,545
You've understood the reality of the past...

894
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:47,641
and of the present.

895
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:51,012
Now for the future.

896
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:54,779
A question:

897
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:58,524
"How does one man
assert power over another?"

898
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,692
By making him suffer.

899
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:06,023
Exactly. Obedience is not enough.

900
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:12,031
Power is inflicting pain and humiliation.
Otherwise, you cannot be sure.

901
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,408
Power is tearing human minds apart...

902
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:20,907
and putting them together again
in new shapes of your own choosing.

903
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:23,950
Power is not a means, it is an end.

904
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:29,288
In our world, there will only be triumph
and self-abasement.

905
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,824
Everything else, we shall destroy.

906
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:35,962
The past is forbidden. Why?

907
01:30:37,465 --> 01:30:40,593
Because when we can cut man
from his own past...

908
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:45,505
then we can cut him from his family,
his children, other men.

909
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:51,269
There is no loyalty,
except loyalty to the Party.

910
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,815
There is no love, except love of Big Brother.

911
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:00,286
All competing pleasures, we will destroy.

912
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:06,090
If you want a vision of the future, imagine...

913
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:08,957
a boot stamping on a human face forever.

914
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:20,064
You are thinking
that my face is old and tired...

915
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:23,670
that while I talk of power...

916
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:26,871
I'm unable to prevent
the decay of my own body.

917
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:31,284
But the individual is only a cell.

918
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:36,353
And the weariness of the cell
is the vigor of the organism.

919
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:39,291
-You'll fail.
-Why?

920
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:42,620
It's impossible.

921
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:47,694
Hatred, the fear of life.

922
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:50,869
Why is hate less vital than love?

923
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,340
I don't know.

924
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,442
But somehow you'll fail.

925
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,312
Something will defeat you.

926
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,680
Life will defeat you.

927
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:04,949
We control life at all levels.

928
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,254
We create human nature.

929
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:11,484
Men are infinitely malleable.

930
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:17,623
Or perhaps you've returned to your old idea
that the proletarians will arise.

931
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:20,166
Put it out of your mind.

932
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:22,726
They are helpless animals.

933
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,698
Humanity is the body.

934
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:31,075
I don't care. In the end, they'll beat you.

935
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:35,273
Sooner or later, they'll tear you to pieces.

936
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:38,776
On what evidence?

937
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,149
Goldstein's book.

938
01:32:43,524 --> 01:32:47,483
I wrote it.
Or, at least, I collaborated in writing it.

939
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:51,331
No book is individually produced,
as you know.

940
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:54,902
I just believe it.

941
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:58,767
I know you'll fail.

942
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:02,432
Something in this world...

943
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:06,345
some spirit you will never overcome....

944
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,273
What is it, this principle?

945
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:12,212
I don't know.

946
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,215
The spirit of man.

947
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,788
And do you consider yourself a man?

948
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,618
Yes.

949
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,059
If you are a man, you're the last man.

950
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:29,264
Your kind is extinct.

951
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,901
We are the inheritors.

952
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,368
Do you understand that you are alone?

953
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:40,113
You are outside history.

954
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:42,881
You unexist.

955
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,081
Get up.

956
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:08,038
Come here.

957
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,325
Look at you.

958
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:30,559
You're rotting away.

959
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:45,106
That is the last man.

960
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:49,380
If you are human, that is humanity.

961
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,320
It will not last forever.

962
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:57,589
You can escape from it
whenever you choose.

963
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,357
Everything depends on you.

964
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:01,826
You did it.

965
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:05,430
You reduced me to this.

966
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:07,332
No, Winston.

967
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,595
You reduced yourself to it.

968
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,837
When will you shoot me?

969
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,375
Might take a long time.

970
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:21,581
But don't give up hope.

971
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,783
Everyone is cured sooner or later.

972
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:28,713
And in the end...

973
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:31,952
we shall shoot you.

974
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:35,057
The law of gravity is nonsense.

975
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:37,725
No such law exists.

976
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:40,196
If I think I float...

977
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:42,869
and you think I float...

978
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:44,928
then it happens.

979
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:46,537
I love you.

980
01:35:46,807 --> 01:35:50,299
You have the strength, Winston.
You have the whole Party.

981
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:52,472
You are the Party.

982
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:55,680
You're one of us, one of the chosen.

983
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,782
I love you.

984
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:00,311
I love you, too.

985
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:10,558
Julia, my love.

986
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:23,369
Get up.

987
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:31,847
Stand up straighter.

988
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,050
Look me in the face.

989
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:43,262
Tell me, Winston, and remember, no lies.

990
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:48,527
What are your true feelings
towards Big Brother?

991
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,238
-I hate him.
-You must love him.

992
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:55,934
It's not enough to obey him.

993
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,404
You must love him.

994
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:01,843
Room 101.

995
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:32,506
You asked me once, Winston,
what was in Room 101.

996
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:37,345
I told you that you knew, already.
Everyone knows.

997
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,986
The thing that is in Room 101...

998
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:46,489
is the worst thing in the world.

999
01:37:57,738 --> 01:38:00,298
It goes beyond fear of pain or death.

1000
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:05,609
It is unendurable,
and it varies from individual to individual.

1001
01:38:07,114 --> 01:38:10,880
It may be burial alive or castration...

1002
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:13,786
or many other things.

1003
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:21,016
In your case, it is rats.

1004
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,220
No.

1005
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:31,136
Please. What do you want me to do?

1006
01:38:31,505 --> 01:38:33,837
You will do what is required of you.

1007
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,609
What? What is it?

1008
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,612
How can I do it if I don't know what it is?

1009
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:45,677
In the proletarian areas,
they will attack a baby...

1010
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:49,388
and within five minutes, strip it to the bone.

1011
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:52,887
They also attack the sick and dying.

1012
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:58,991
They show astonishing intelligence
in knowing when a human being is helpless.

1013
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:09,102
Please.

1014
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:17,347
The mask fits over your head,
leaving no exit.

1015
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:20,279
I press the first lever...

1016
01:39:20,387 --> 01:39:22,878
and the rats move into
the front compartment.

1017
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:27,753
I press the second,
and the door of the cage will slide up.

1018
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:32,496
These starving brutes
will shoot at you like bullets.

1019
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,959
Have you ever seen a rat
leap through the air?

1020
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:43,267
They will leap onto your face
and bore straight into it.

1021
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:46,705
Sometimes they attack the eyes first.

1022
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:52,917
Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks
and devour the tongue.

1023
01:39:57,958 --> 01:40:01,689
Tell me. What do you want?

1024
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:08,966
No, please.

1025
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:18,703
I love you.

1026
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:23,808
Do it to her! Do it to Julia!

1027
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:26,752
I don't care what you do to her,
but do it to her!

1028
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:29,880
Tear her my face off!
Do it to Julia, not to me!

1029
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:33,516
Do it to Julia!

1030
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:38,659
Not me!

1031
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:47,073
A vast military buildup has been reported
in the Sahara Desert...

1032
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:49,608
in Sectors 17 and 18 of the war zones.

1033
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:53,469
That is the end of the announcement.

1034
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:33,947
Brother.

1035
01:41:42,863 --> 01:41:44,296
On the house.

1036
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:53,869
Thank you for coming.

1037
01:41:57,911 --> 01:42:01,972
You are warned to stand by
for an important announcement at 15:30.

1038
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,917
This is news of
the gravest national consequence...

1039
01:42:05,018 --> 01:42:06,952
concerning the war with Eurasia.

1040
01:42:07,054 --> 01:42:08,214
15:30.

1041
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:12,819
Are you worried about the African front?

1042
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:19,523
The news is disquieting in the extreme.
I've been worrying about it all day.

1043
01:42:20,367 --> 01:42:22,858
It's not just a question of losing Africa.

1044
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:27,669
For the first time, the territory of Oceania
itself is threatened by invasion.

1045
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:29,569
It's inconceivable.

1046
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:40,816
It must have been possible
to outflank them in some way.

1047
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:49,923
I have an instinct.

1048
01:42:51,798 --> 01:42:53,425
There's bad news on the way.

1049
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:01,297
I told them all about you.

1050
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:07,977
I'm only thankful they got me
before it was too late.

1051
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:10,680
Yes, I told them about you, too.

1052
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:13,242
Thoughtcrime...

1053
01:43:15,722 --> 01:43:17,690
sexcrime, all your treachery.

1054
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:28,658
I have a meeting to go to.

1055
01:43:32,673 --> 01:43:34,197
We must meet again.

1056
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,068
Yes.

1057
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:42,877
We must meet again.

1058
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:03,263
I accuse myself of the following crimes:

1059
01:44:04,304 --> 01:44:07,102
I have seduced Party members
of both sexes...

1060
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:10,234
I've been to the proletarian areas...

1061
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:14,272
I deliberately contracted syphilis
in order to spread the disease...

1062
01:44:14,381 --> 01:44:16,849
to my wife and other Party members.

1063
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:21,250
Together with other agents,
I have counterfeited banknotes...

1064
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:26,458
wrecked industrial machinery,
polluted the water supply...

1065
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:30,296
guided Eurasian rocket bombs
to targets on Airstrip One...

1066
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:32,729
by means of coded radio signals.

1067
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:38,468
I stand here, a victim of the influence
of Emmanuel Goldstein.

1068
01:44:39,373 --> 01:44:41,238
Guilty on all counts.

1069
01:44:43,043 --> 01:44:46,137
I'm glad I was caught.
I was mentally deranged.

1070
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:49,014
Now I am cured.

1071
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:55,088
I ask only for you to accept
my love of our leader.

1072
01:44:56,523 --> 01:45:00,721
I ask only to be shot
while my mind is still clean.

1073
01:45:13,273 --> 01:45:14,968
A glorious victory!

1074
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:17,733
A vast, strategic maneuver to outflank...

1075
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:21,610
the Eurasian Forces on the African front
has been successful.

1076
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:27,620
Perfectly coordinated, it has resulted
in the utter rout of the Eurasian Army.

1077
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:33,323
There have been nearly a million prisoners.
It has been an utter rout.

1078
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:35,488
Waiter?

1079
01:45:37,931 --> 01:45:42,391
This immense victory brings the war
within measurable distance of its end.

1080
01:45:44,438 --> 01:45:45,928
Wonderful news.

1081
01:46:43,597 --> 01:46:44,894
I love you.
