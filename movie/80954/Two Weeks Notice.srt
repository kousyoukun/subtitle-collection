00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,069
LUCY: I'm an attorney.
This isn't how I argue.

2
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,699
MAN:
You're getting on my nerves!

3
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,658
This building has been here 75 years. It
deserves to remain for the community...

4
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,369
because it represents
the ideals of that time!

5
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,286
The community deserves to have this as
a landmark. It is something to...

6
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:44,332
And we're removing it from our
children's children. You go back here.

7
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,128
This a community theater, and everyone
should benefit from this building!

8
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,844
This is your last warning! We got
a permit to take down this building!

9
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,759
I have a permit that allows me
to gather for the purpose...

10
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,805
of expressing my constitutional
right of free speech!

11
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,474
- You want to get killed, lady?
- Sir, according to city code...

12
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,770
- Forget about your code!
- Section 245: If a committee...

13
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:11,609
FOREMAN: Forget about the code, lady!
- When a landmark's committee decision...

14
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,904
FOREMAN: Lady, you're in violation!
- Have you ever read the Constitution?

15
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,414
Take it up, Charlie!
Watch this constitution.

16
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,870
LUCY: Do you read?
FOREMAN: Clear the area!

17
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,001
Yeah, you're clear. Go ahead.

18
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,664
(BEEPING)

19
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,839
Okay, you guys,
this is just a scare tactic.

20
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,424
- That's all this is.
- Well, it's sort of working.

21
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:37,184
Meryl, they do productions from the
Y here, productions with little people!

22
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:42,599
The Nutcracker and Hair. We have to
lie down in protest. Take out your mats.

23
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,477
Here, I've got your protective eye gear,
your sun block and your wet naps.

24
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,693
- Everybody, lie down in protest!
FOREMAN: Get out of the way.

25
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,655
- We will prevail!
- You will go to jail!

26
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,366
Tom! Lock arms.

27
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,577
- I'm not feeling great about this.
LUCY: Have a little faith.

28
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,835
Meryl, would you marry me?

29
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,620
Really?

30
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:09,008
Oh, my God! Yes!

31
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,919
FOREMAN:
Shut it down, Charlie.

32
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,844
- I love you.
- Hey, you guys, they stopped.

33
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,015
You're good luck. There is justice
in the world. We prevailed!

34
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,149
FOREMAN:
Lunatic!

35
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,358
Crazy lady!

36
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,241
- We should call our parents.
- Yeah.

37
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,447
Here are your wet naps.

38
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,578
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks. We had a good time.

39
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,080
- I'm glad. Bye.
- Bye.

40
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,536
Bye. Thank you.

41
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,043
I'll pay you back
this time, guys. I promise.

42
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,082
What are parents for, if not to bail their
daughter and her friends out of jail?

43
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,875
So did they knock it down?

44
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,890
I'm not getting through to people.
Why don't people respond to me?

45
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,719
Honey, Wade Corporation is not people,
it's a heartless profit machine.

46
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,979
And it's getting worse all the time.

47
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,265
LARRY: They're bidding
on the Surf Avenue lot.

48
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,934
They wanna put up condos
and tear down the center.

49
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,853
Wait, our community center?
My community center?

50
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,398
Come on, honey,
let's discuss it over dinner.

51
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,361
No, Dad, you know what? I'm just tired.
I think I'll just go home.

52
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,758
ANSEL:
<i>Hi, honey, it's Ansel.</i>

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,594
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
make it back for your birthday.</i>

54
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,806
<i>We got a lot of new trainees on board
and they put the green in Greenpeace.</i>

55
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,722
<i>But I'm saving whales
and thinking of you. Love you.</i>

56
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,483
Yeah, hi, Mr. Wong.
Lucy Kelson.

57
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,444
Fine. I would like a number 17...

58
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,405
a number fou... Number five.

59
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,199
No. Number seven?
Seven.

60
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:09,621
Can I get the number four
without the garlic sauce?

61
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:15,759
Okay, and then maybe
two orders of number 26.

62
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,294
And...

63
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,506
Yes, it's for one.

64
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,096
And that's it.
No! Give me a number eight.

65
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,886
Give me two number eights.

66
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,099
Okay.

67
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,479
Okay.

68
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,517
Okay. Bye.

(APPLAUSE ECHOING)

70
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,212
When they told me I'd been chosen
the Medical Center's Man of the Year...

71
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,422
I assumed it had
something to do with...

72
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,008
the millions we contributed
to the pediatric wing.

73
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:05,301
But as it turns out, I had my appendix
removed earlier this year...

74
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,095
and under anesthesia,
I apparently proposed marriage...

75
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,854
to every nurse in the hospital.

76
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,109
Including the many
attractive male nurses.

77
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,356
REPORTER: Why are pediatrics
so important to Wade?

78
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,741
I think feet are very important,
aren't they?

79
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,779
I'm just teasing. I know there's
more to pediatrics than feet.

80
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,791
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Always nice to see you.

81
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,327
TERRY: George, congratulations.
- Terry, how are you?

82
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,120
- Still slicing?
TERRY: Indeed.

83
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,378
GEORGE:
I bet you are.

84
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,587
Hi, there. Oh, yes, the Emile family.
Lovely. So good.

85
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,720
- Hi.
- Nice to see you. Take care.

86
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,927
- Melanie Corman. Administration.
- Ah-ha.

87
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,469
My friend Elaine Cominsky wants to
meet you, but she's shy. Is that okay?

88
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,263
That's fine. I've been too nervous
to meet Elaine myself.

89
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,309
- Good. Don't move. Great tie.
- Thanks. I was rather nervous about it.

90
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,522
- Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.

91
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,189
- Hey, your brother wants to see you.
- What? Now? Tonight?

92
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:05,031
That's what he said. Although sometimes
it's hard to tell with the accent.

93
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,287
This is Elaine.

94
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,665
- Oh, hello.
- Hi. Would you sign my <i>GQ?</i>

GEORGE:
GQ! I see what you mean.

97
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,168
Sorry, I thought it was a medical term.
You had me all excited.

98
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,961
- "To Elaine, George Wade."
- Thank you.

99
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,299
Hang on just one second.

100
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,590
There's no way I'm running up
to Westchester just because he calls.

101
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,384
It's absurd. He'll just have to wait.

102
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,475
- Right on. Hey, man, forget him.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,810
- Should I get the car?
- Yes, get the car.

- Good evening, Mr. George.
- Good evening, Rosario.

106
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,206
- Excellent new hairdo.
- Mr. George.

107
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,998
No, I'm serious. You look like
a young Imelda Marcos.

- Hello, George.
- Hello, Helen.

109
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,425
Don't you think Rosario
looks particularly lovely tonight?

110
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,308
I hadn't really noticed.
Rosario, the children need baths, please.

111
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,434
Yes, Miss Helen.

112
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,055
- So how are the kids, apart from dirty?
HELEN: They're fine.

113
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,395
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd love some Milk Duds.

114
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,444
We don't have any.
I could send out for one.

115
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:25,858
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous. If you're
going to send out, get a whole box.

116
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,073
- Howard is in the gym.
- Right.

117
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:35,493
Forty-five minutes, 6.5 miles an hour,
at an elevation of three.

118
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,415
It's incredible how much
more relaxed I feel.

119
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,381
- Helen does an hour a day too.
- Yes, you both seem extremely relaxed.

120
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,262
You can cut the relaxation
with a knife.

121
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,765
So why am I here, Howie?

122
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,388
We lost the West Side waterfront deal
because your chief counsel...

123
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,809
your latest model-slash-attorney...

124
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,979
forgot to file
an Environmental Impact Report.

125
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,864
I will admit that the law
is not Amber's strong point.

126
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,367
- That's why I fired her.
HOWARD: No, 1 fired her.

127
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:13,030
Just as I fired Debbie
from St. Barts' Law School...

128
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,166
and Stacy from Online Law School.

129
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,830
I want someone from Yale or Columbia
or from the continental United States.

130
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,587
Women of that level of intellectual
ability often find me shallow.

131
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,298
HOWARD: Then hire a man.
- Don't be absurd.

132
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,462
Because they wouldn't sleep with you?

133
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,008
No, because it would make you
and Dad too happy.

134
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,431
Dad has been dead for 10 years.

135
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,893
Well, there is no reason for him
to start enjoying himself now.

136
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:44,774
HOWARD: Get someone who can write
a brief instead of removing yours.

137
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,234
And she can handle your
divorce while she's at it.

138
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,150
You are still getting divorced?

139
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:56,665
Unless my ex-wife decides to fall in love
with me again, or for the first time, yeah.

140
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,578
HOWARD: No! Why do you
always find that so funny?

141
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,465
- It's very hard to say.
- Hire a real attorney by tomorrow.

Don't!

TIFFANY: 100%.

Hence, blond hair,
blue eyes, cheekbones.

146
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,618
Sorry to have kept you so long, but at
least I feel I know everything about you.

147
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:37,121
And I you. You know, usually I'm so
nervous at interviews, but that was fun.

148

Yes. Isn't fun fun?
It's been a pleasure, Tiffany.

Hi, I'm Lucy Kelson.
I'm an attorney.

151
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,798
Have you ever heard
of Saint-Tropez Law School?

152
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,962
- No.
- What a shame.

153
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,257
- Where did you go to law school?
- Harvard.

154
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,141
- Harvard?
- Yes.

155
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,053
Intriguing. Tell me more.
What's your background?

156
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,645
I don't see how that's relevant. I work
for the Coalition for the Homeless.

157
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,649
- At Legal Aid.
- That can't pay much.

158
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,560
I'm not very interested in money.

159
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,819
(CHUCKLES)

160
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,031
Wait a minute.
You're Kelson.

161
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,284
You lie in front of
our wrecking balls.

162
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,661
- You attacked the Zegman brothers...
- I did not.

163
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,242
It's not my fault they walked
under a protest sign.

164
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,658
- You're not here for a job?
- I'm representing...

165
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,543
the Coney Island Community Center.
It was built in 1922.

166
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,831
It's the heart of Coney Island.
It has adult education, basketball...

167
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,672
CPR, Lamaze, water ballet,
senior's tae kwon do. It's great.

168
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,711
For children, it's a home
away from home.

169
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,972
I mean, I practically grew up there.

170
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,179
It's lovely, but Trump has the
inside track. Nice to meet you.

171
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,969
No, Mr. Wade,
you don't understand.

172
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,853
I live there,
as well as my parents.

173
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,231
They know Assemblyman Perez,
who's on the board.

174
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,987
If you can guarantee the preservation of
this center, I'll guarantee you the build.

175
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,030
But why us?
Why Wade?

176
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,904
Well, I can't get in to see Trump and
the Zegmans have a restraining order.

177
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,613
MAN:
Mr. W.?

178
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,867
You're supposed to be taping
The View in half an hour...

179
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:08,664
and <i>Public Policy</i> needs a quote
on the challenges of urban planning. Hey.

180
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,050
Right. Yes. Quote, quote,
quote, quote...

181
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,758
What I love about architecture
is its ability to shape a community.

182
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,391
This center has shaped the community!
It turns strangers into neighbors...

183
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,144
Its ability to change
strangers into neighbors.

184
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,102
How the right design for a park
can make people feel secure.

185
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:30,360
How a school building can be functional
and beautiful so that kids feel...

186
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:35,570
No, the community center makes children
feel engaged. It allows them a place...

187
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,737
Functional and beautiful so that kids
feel engaged instead of imprisoned?

188
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,404
- Yeah, sounds good.
- I like that.

189
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,074
But I said a community center,
not a school.

190
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,995
I know, it's all very good.
Jump in. Thanks.

191
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,002
- Nice shirt.
LUCY: Thank you.

192

(LUCY CLEARS THROAT)

193
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,597
So do we have a deal?

194
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,559
No. I want something else from you.

195
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:12,273
No. I'm fully aware of your reputation
and there's no way you're getting that.

196
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,904
- Getting what?
- You know.

197
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,691
The sex.
That's not gonna happen.

198
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:23,330
No, that would be nice, but what
I really need is a new chief counsel.

199
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,992
Well, I think I would
prefer the sex, because...

200
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,788
Okay, if you take the job, I promise
to save your community center.

201
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,921
You can direct our pro bono efforts.

202
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,756
That's millions of dollars
at your charitable disposal.

203
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,795
You couldn't possibly want me.

204
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,090
I've spent my life
working against people like you.

205
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,351
Well, maybe if you work for me,
you'll win occasionally.

206
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,933
- I... I don't...
- I need an answer immediately.

207
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,890
Here is my direct number
at the Grand Hotel.

208
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,186
- You live at a hotel?
- Well, I own the hotel and I live there.

209
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,025
My life is very much like Monopoly.

210
00:14:56,187 --> 00:15:01,535
And I know you wouldn't care,
but I'll start you at $250,000.

211
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,747
There's also usually
a very nice Christmas bonus.

212
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,118
Thank you.

213
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,594
- Hi, Lu.
LUCY: Hey, Rocco.

214
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,731
- I can't believe how much I ate.
- I'm proud of you.

215
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,938
The whole left side of the menu.

216
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,194
You know when I get tense,
I just start to eat.

217
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:23,950
- Honey, you cannot work for that man.
- Hey, we can use the bail money.

218
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,031
- Remember what Sun Tzu said?
LUCY: Yes.

219
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,869
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

220
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,159
Sun Tzu didn't have a daughter.

221
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,961
What's this?
Oh, dessert. Thank you.

222
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,998
It's the only way to save
the community center.

223
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,087
It is. And if I work for him...

224
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:44,004
I have huge resources at my
disposal for charities and shelters...

225
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,719
- Yes, but...
LUCY: Mom, I promise.

226
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,805
I will still be your daughter.
I will still be a lawyer.

227
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,221
And I will still have
all the same ideals.

228
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,103
Let's update all the files.

229
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,231
Especially the muni-codes
because I'll need those.

230
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,740
I'm gonna speak with Mr. Wade.

231
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,276
Mr. Wade, so sorry to bother.

232
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,787
I've been over the Environmental
Impact Reports for Island Towers.

233
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,165
- I would really love to talk to you.
- Very good.

234
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,327
I really wanted to ask you:
Which one of these do you prefer?

235
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,494
How do you mean?

236
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,398
It's for my new
personalized stationery.

237
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,794
Is this a trick question?
They look exactly the same to me.

238
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,592
No, not at all. This is a linen finish
and this is a watermarked vellum finish.

239
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,478
Leaving aside the fact that they've
taken perfectly good forests...

240
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,140
and denuded them in order
to produce this nonrecyclable paper...

241
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,685
I would say it was...

242
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,366
Well, then this one. It tastes better.

243
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,920
Do you know, I've asked
30 people that question.

244
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,956
You're the only one to come up
with that.

245
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,170
LUCY:
Hmm.

246
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,836
My God, you're good.
I'm getting you a bigger office.

247
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,098
LUCY: No, it's very sweet,
but I'd rather go over the...

248
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,428
Very firm.

249
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,147
But is it too firm?

250
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,527
There's debate among chiropractors
about the optimum level of tension.

251
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,811
What are your thoughts?

252
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,982
If you really want to know,
the more firm the mattress...

253
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,369
the more pressure on the 5th vertebra
leading to herniation and subluxation.

254
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,870

Hmm.

255
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,287
Quite bouncy, though.

- Hello.
- Yes, I'm glad you're up.

259
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,845
I didn't want to wake you.
I just felt like a chat.

00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,008
George, it is 2:15 in the morning.

Can't you talk to whatever
Mensa candidate you're with?

262
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,387
I resent the implication...

263
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,272
that because someone
may not share your high IQ...

264
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,274
they're not a person of substance.

- Wow.
- You all right?

266
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,479
I swallowed my Altoid.

267
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,741
She swallowed her Altoid. That can
happen. A sudden hair flick, dangerous.

268
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,904
Okay, George, I am tired.
Put her on the phone.

269
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,246
You mean, put her on the phone?

Put her on the phone!

All right. Someone for you.

- Yes, she seemed very special.

Okay, I've got to get up early
for a divorce case, so I have to go.

Yes. Now that we have to talk about.
Now, do you think I should cry?

little machine gun bursts of sobs.

288

A little more hysteria,
more of a whimper than a sob.

The terms have been set.
It's called a prenup.

We both know...

In English, although I can follow you
in German and Japanese if you prefer.

301
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,239
- She wants double the alimony.
- No way.

(SPEAKS IN GERMAN AND JAPANESE)

303
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,112
Given the situation,
it's not an unreasonable request.

304
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,202
You're referring to the alleged
infidelity, are you not?

305
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,459
Alleged? He was having
sex with her in our bed.

306
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,212
I knew you were worried
to get anything on that sofa.

307
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,499
- How dare you come in here...
- I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

308
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,087
Please.

309
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,427
So you are saying that infidelity
is worth twice the alimony.

310
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,933
Using your reasoning,
any infidelity on her part...

311
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,890
would have to be held against her
in a monetary accounting.

312
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,305
What are you suggesting?

313
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:50,568
The soon to be ex-Mrs. Wade did a little
couch time with a company accountant.

314
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,400
And he's willing to testify.

315
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,907
I have loyal employees.
I think it's the health plan.

316
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,909
- The health plan is excellent.
- Thank you.

317
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,115
You're welcome.

318
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,326
- We will not agree to pay any...
- We will pay the alimony...

319
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,242
plus $100,000 and
a generous property settlement...

from further obligation.

- What?

322

Watch it or you will not
get the estate, Mrs. Wade.

Divorce always gives me
an appetite. Kebab?

No, I've never warmed
to the idea of a flesh Popsicle.

- One, please. Chicken, thank you.
- Why did you give her the money?

334
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,370
She'd never have stopped
till she got what she wanted.

335
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,628
You always say I have a responsibility
towards those less fortunate.

336
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,039
Everybody is less
fortunate than you...

337
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,926
so just give the money to someone
who's not gonna spend it on collagen.

338

Okay, now,
what do you think of this?

352
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,064
Too ornate or do you
think it's belt-acular?

353

447
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,564
Lucy, your résumé is amazing.
You know that.

448
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,524
But we do a lot of
business with Wade.

449
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,110
More reason for me to
make a smooth transition.

450
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,320
- Lucy.
- Yes.

451
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,860
George Wade called me this morning
and informed me...

452
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,326
that you are indispensable
to his organization.

453
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,875
Ah.

454
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,081
At the moment,
we're not hiring.

455
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,250
Then why did you agree to see me?

456
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,882
Honestly, we're partners
with Zodiac Construction...

457
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,714
They do millions of dollars
of business with Wade Realty...

458
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,720
- And Mr. Wade...
- Doesn't want you to hire me.

459
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,807
The attorney who was planning
to quit reconsidered.

460
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,014
- When did Mr. Wade call?
- He never called.

461
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,349
- When?!
- Maybe an hour ago.

462
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,766
Make sure you massage
his cloven hoof!

463
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,809
GEORGE:
I'm feeling a pain in my ass.

464
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,071
I am unemployable! You called everyone
except for Slurpee Heaven!

465
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,358
That is not true. I did call Slurpee
Heaven. They didn't want you.

466
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,777
You had attitude.
You weren't Slurpee material.

467
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,664
- You should really let us work on you.
- I don't like to be touched!

468
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,041
I'm sorry, you guys are great.
It's not you.

469
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,201
All right, listen.

470
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:32,418
You have a contract and it says you will
work until Island Towers is finalized.

471
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:36,586
Which is completion of construction,
or I can stop you working elsewhere.

472
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,256
And there's no loopholes because
you drafted it and you're the best.

473
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:45,766
I think you drafted it that way
because you don't really want to go.

474
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,271
Does it kill you how well I know you?

475
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,311
Honey, this contract is excellent work.
I'm very proud of you.

476
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,320
<i>LUCY: Dad, I'm trying
to get out of it.</i>

477
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,858
I don't know why you went to work
for that philandering robber baron.

478
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,776
<i>You usually have impeccable instincts.</i>

479
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,321
<i>Look at your boyfriend, Ansel.
He's a dedicated environmental warrior.</i>

480
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:07,617
This is ironclad. Houdini couldn't
get out of this contract.

481
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,161
You should've stayed
at the legal aid job.

482
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,581
If I do pro bono work with a company
with these resources...

483
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,967
I can accomplish so much...
- Come on over for strawberry ice cream.

484
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,471
Have Tofutti! You heard what the doctor
said. Your cholesterol is over 300!

485
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,177
You're basically a solid.

486
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,560
Two of the greatest legal minds
in this country arguing over dessert.

487
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,642
Lucy, it was your choice to work
for that man.

488
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:33,480
You could've done anything. You
could've clerked for the Supreme Court.

489
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,019
I don't know what to tell you.

490
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,029
Short of going in and
deliberately trying to get fired.

491
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,987
RUTH:
<i>You stay away from that freezer!</i>

492
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,463
Good morning, boys.

493
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:03,381
Oops. Sorry, I am so late.

494
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,424
That's fine.
We only just got here.

495
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,684
- Forty-five minutes ago.
LUCY: Hmm.

496
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,641
Howie, are these your kids?

497
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,688
You know,
I've never actually met them.

498
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,476
They are good-looking boys.

499
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,488
That's a girl.
That's Sue and Paul.

500
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,526
LUCY:
Yes, so it is.

501
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,697
You know what?
She is gonna be a heartbreaker.

502
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,327
- That's Paul.
LUCY: Hmm.

503
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,243
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sorry.

504
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,457
So we've got the Coney Island project.

505
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,593
I'd like to stir up some publicity
if we could.

506
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,053
Yes, very nice.

507
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,058
I'm...

508
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:59,649
I'm working on endorsements
from local merchants.

509
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,571
Hmm.

510
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,158
Any thoughts, George?

511
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:10,743
Yes, we were working
on some ideas there.

512
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,041
Hiya.

513
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,462
I thought that was a terrific meeting.
We should have more meetings like that.

514
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,123
- Pathetic.
- What's pathetic?

515
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,259
- You. I know what you're doing.
- I am not doing anything.

516
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,921
You think if you come in late and spit
on the boss that will get you fired?

517
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,805
Not in this company.

518
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,308
- Chris.
CHRIS: George.

519
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,268
George, I have an ulcer.

520
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,434
I don't sleep well, mostly because
you keep calling me at night.

521
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,944
If you don't call me,
I dream you're gonna call me.

522
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,946
I think about you in the shower,
not in a good way...

523
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,450
but in an I'm-so-distracted-I-can't-
remember-if-I washed-my-hair way.

524
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,452
So I wash my hair twice.

525
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,740
So I have a hole in my stomach,
I am running out of shampoo...

526
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:56,786
and today is the first time in my life
I did not give 1000 percent on the job...

527
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,626
and I hate that feeling!

528
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:09,427
- I won't call after hours.
- You will, George! You know you will.

529
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,508
Yeah, I will.

530
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:18,645
I just don't think we can see each
other professionally anymore.

531
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,118
All right. Stay until you
find a replacement.

532
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:33,531
Train him up for a couple of weeks,
then you can go to Slurpee Heaven.

533
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,497
Thank you! I promise I will find
you somebody amazing.

534
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,333
Somebody better than me
because I'm not even any good.

535
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,715
- No.
- A glorified ambulance chaser.

536
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,552
Thank you.

537
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,054
(LUCY SIGHS)

538
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,976
(CLANGING)

539
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,400
LUCY: I got it.
It's just my earring.

540
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,561
Ah! Ah! Ow!

541
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,151
- My hair!
GEORGE: That's my overpriced belt.

542
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,318
LUCY:
Just get it off!

543
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,035
Howard.

544
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,372
Join us.
We were just brainstorming.

545
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,916
- Lucy?
LUCY: Yes.

546
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:24,047
I was thinking it might be a good idea
to do a photo op at the build site...

547
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,049
where George would be in the...

548
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,838
George in the foreground,
pointing up to the sky...

549
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,597
like this.
- Yes.

550
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:37,762
Then I thought I could take my belt
off, as if to say, let's get to work!

551
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,897
LUCY:
Right. Right-o.

552
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,727
GEORGE: On behalf of Wade Corporation,
I thank the Community Board...

553
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,897
for giving us the opportunity
to work with you on this project.

554
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,283
And we look forward to seeing
all of you at the groundbreaking.

555
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,406
I did well with those eight people.

556
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,117
- I thought you were fantastic.
MAN: This way, Mr. Wade.

557
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,326
- Just Mr. Wade.
- Oh.

558
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,625
PHOTOGRAPHER: More.
- Great. Can we go now?

559
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,583
Absolutely. I just want
to say hello to my folks.

560
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,792
Your folks?

561
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,964
Excuse me.

562
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,792
Hello.

563
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,050
LARRY: Honey.
LUCY: Hi.

564
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,008
- New coat? I like it.
LUCY: Thanks.

565
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,846
What a wonderful surprise!
We finally meet after all this time.

566
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,305
George Wade.

567
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,641
Mrs. Kelson, I presume.

568
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,896
What a pleasure.

569
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:32,324
Yeah. Well, I can certainly see
where Lucy gets her stare from.

570
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,450
I'm Larry.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

571
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,657
Thanks, Larry.
Same here.

572
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,664
Thank you for letting Lucy quit.
It certainly made our week.

573
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,497
- Great pleasure.
- We should get back to the office.

574
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,627
- Come on! Have some cake.
- We can't.

575
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,005
We're two blocks
from the apartment.

576
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,460
- You live around here?
- Sure.

577
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,126
- What a charming coincidence.
- It won't be charming...

578
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,968
once you block out the sun
with this condo-hotel monstrosity!

579
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,801
We will have a sun deck.

580
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,730
That's something, isn't it?

581
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,693
GEORGE: I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your support on this.

582
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,695
LARRY: At least you're keeping
the community center.

583
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,858
Unless you're willing to reconsider
the entire project.

584
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,993
GEORGE: That won't happen.
It is over 50 million in profits.

585
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,656
RUTH: It's immoral that any human being
should acquire that much wealth.

586
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,495
I don't know how you sleep at night.

587
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,160
GEORGE: I have a machine
that simulates the ocean.

588
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,669
RUTH:
Oh, God.

589
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,455
LUCY:
You're not helping yourself.

590
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,749
LARRY: Do those really work?
GEORGE: Yes.

591
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:36,680
LUCY: I used to come up here
when I was a kid. My special place.

592
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,681
Yes, well, every kid needs one.

593
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,352
I had a small one-bedroom
on Park and 91st.

594
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,180
<i>Well, that's so very Oliver Twist.</i>

595
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,896
Times were hard. But you
know what? We were happy.

596
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,860
- Didn't have a view as good as this.
LUCY: It's great, isn't it?

597
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,196
I used to take up some ice cream
and my Carole King tape...

598
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,826
and look at the neighborhood.

599
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,580
It's amazing what you could see.
At night, the building went downstairs.

600
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,868
The fathers stood on one corner.
The mothers stood on the other.

601
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,379
Kids would just ride
their bicycles around.

602
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,040
As you can see,
not much has changed.

603
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,552
Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb would be sitting
in the middle of the street...

604
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,386
saving a parking space for their
kids who were coming next weekend.

605
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,060
And you up here on your own.

606
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,480
It's hard to find a quiet
place in Brooklyn to think.

607
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:33,024
Or to replay whatever argument
I just had with my mother.

608
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,609
Yes.

609
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,774
Yeah, she's terrifying.

610
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,070
I thought she was gonna kill me
and feed me to the poor.

611
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,580
Yeah, she's a piece of work.

612
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,918
But for better or worse, she's the voice
in my head pushing me to do better.

613
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:53,082
Challenge the accepted wisdom. Never
settle for a B instead of an A on a test.

614
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,420
You once got a B?

615
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,503
- Hypothetically speaking.
- Right.

616
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:04,101
Of course, no matter how hard I try,
I will never live up to her expectations.

617
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,731
Well, there are worse things in life.
Like no one having any expectations.

618
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,111
There's something amuck
with this sponge cake.

619
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,620
Tofu.

620
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,679
You're not concentrating.
This offends me.

621
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,966
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ton.

622
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,429
I lost Lucy.

623
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,352
I just think it's a shame because I've
come to rely on her for everything.

624
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,690
And I trust her completely,
and she's funny.

625
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,150
Not deliberately, of course.

626
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,816
Hey, you know, it's probably
for the best though.

627
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,280
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

628
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,285
Two things I know is chess and women.

629
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:13,378
Chess, it has rules, pieces,
rooks, knights, bishops.

630
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,382
They move in predictable patterns.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

631
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,010
But women, they don't have
no rules, man.

632
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,342
They move in unpredictable ways too.

633
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,007
Nobody ever wins or loses
when it comes to women.

634
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,519
You talk about your feelings until
your breath is sucked out your body.

635
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,223
All men are pawns when it comes
to women.

636
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,689
Especially a smart one like Lucy.
She's hard to control.

637
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,321
And you know, the man
has got to be in control.

638
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,233
Like with me.

639
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:48,451
I come home. When I walk in, I know
my mama has dinner on the table.

640
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:53,206
All right,
so you're still living at home?

641
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,870
Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,918
Of course.

643
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,638
LUCY: Here's somebody interesting,
Polly St. Clair.

644
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:10,268
Well, it's a terrific résumé, Polly.

645
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,178
Congratulations on the baby.

646
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,600
What baby?

647
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,942
Maybe you should check
with me before you talk.

648
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,103
What baby?

649
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,195
I'd like to talk about
your moot-court experience.

650
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,450
What baby?

651
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,904
Yeah, what baby?

652
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,252
GEORGE: You should do the interviews
on your own from now on.

653
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,630
LUCY:
Whatever you say, baby.

654
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,133
Harry Raskin, Richard Beck.

655
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:50,095
There's some interesting prospects
for my replacement. Let's see.

656
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,805
Richard Kelly from Yale.

657
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,265
No, it's gotta be a woman.

658
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,600
What a surprise.

659
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,392
I suppose a certain bust size would help.
Maybe some bathing-suit shots?

660
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,979
- It will annoy Howard if it's a woman.
- Oh.

661
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,488
- Thank you.
- Tell you what.

662
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,774
All I want is someone
as intelligent as you...

663
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,988
but a little less tense
and argumentative.

664
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,280
A sort of Katharine Hepburn figure.

665
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,164
You don't deserve Katharine Hepburn.

666
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,790
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Also too good.

667
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,826
Just stay away from the Hepburns.

668
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,461
You forgot a beet.

669
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,292
- Beet.
- Oh.

670
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,628
Thank you.

671
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,642
GEORGE: I've got that charity
tennis thing tonight.

672
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,436
And I need to know, does this shirt
make me look a bit kind of Bjorn Borg?

673
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:46,823
Ansel and I got into a huge fight,
and I think we just broke up.

674
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,028
Really?

675
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,990
He wants me to go
on a Greenpeace boat.

676
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,995
He thinks I can't embrace life.

677
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,532
Is that the case?
Because I just don't see it.

678
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,245
I just don't see it.

679
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,333
And by the way, how can I embrace him
when he is never here?

680
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:06,969
Maybe it's me. Maybe the rose-colored
glasses have finally come off.

681
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,047
Okay.

682
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,184
We obviously can't leave you alone
with the stapler.

683
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,970
I'll tell you what.
I'll cancel tennis.

684
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,356
They always make me play with Ed Koch.
What can we do to cheer you up?

685
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,937
Nothing. There's no solution.

686
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,477
Good. Good attitude.

687
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,395
I can't help it if I don't like boats.

688
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,823
Surely not all boats.

689
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,860
Yes, all boats.

690
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,365
LUCY: I don't understand.
What is wrong with me?

691
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,876
GEORGE: At the moment,
huge quantities of alcohol.

692
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,753
LUCY: I don't know. I just seem
to drive men away.

693
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,880
There's Ansel.

694
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,918
There's Billy from Legal Aid
who ran off with a stripper.

695
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,712
GEORGE: Gary from the Peace Corps
who married his trainer.

696
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,926
LUCY:
Gary, yes.

697
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,764
What is wrong with me? I want to know.
You're sort of a man.

698
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,265
- All right?
- I'm good.

699
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,608
So tell me. What's the matter with me?

700
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,694
Well, you can be
somewhat intimidating.

701
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,452
You could loosen up a little,
get in touch with your feminine side.

702
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,456
- Okay, that's a good suggestion.
- Perhaps soften your appearance.

703
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:24,121
Not that I don't love that look, but
you could get dolled up occasionally.

704
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:27,257
I'm not going to spend hours
fluffing my hair and applying...

705
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,133
animal-tested makeup to my face...

706
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:34,765
just so I can turn myself into some
male fantasy, degrading Kewpie doll.

707
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,096
Unless I, you know, really
like the guy or something.

708
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,603
- You see, maybe that's the problem.
- Mmm.

709
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,479
You don't like these guys.

710
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:46,063
You drive them away because
you realize they're wrong for you.

711
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,397
They're not wrong for me.

712
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:52,615
We have all the same political goals
and ideals, all of them.

713
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:56,653
Which I guess isn't very romantic,
but what can I say?

714
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,993
I'm fine. What can I say?
I'm just not a romantic person.

715
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,330
Never felt that way about anybody.
Nope. No.

716
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:07,463
No, in high school, Rick Beck took
me parking. You know, parking?

717
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,466
And the whole time I talked
about Nelson Mandela.

718
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,502
Don't know why I did that.

719
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,548
That's hard to say. I certainly would have
found it extremely erotic. Come back.

720
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,637
LUCY:
I'm fine.

721
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,394
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just not good in bed.

722
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,187
Maybe you're not.

723
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,442
(LUCY CHUCKLES)

724
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,854
I am.

725
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,821
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I am really good in bed.

726
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,702
- You might be lousy.
- No, believe me, pal.

727
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,331
You should be so lucky because
the lawyerly exterior...

728
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:47,337
don't let that fool you because
inside I am, like, a complete animal.

729
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,840
It's, like, bobcat.
You know, it's scary.

730
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:56,676
- I can see that it might be.
- No. Look, I can bend like a pretzel.

731
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,515
I'm serious.

732
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:03,349
And I'm not talking the straight kind.
I'm talking, like, the twisty kind.

733
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:07,891
- I think... I think...
- Twisty, salty type of pretzel.

734
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,560
Because that's what
men want, right?

735
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,570
- That is their dream.
- The twisty-bobcat kind of pretzel...

736
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:18,530
that's what you want, and I bet
I could give you a twisty-bobcat pretzel.

737
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,536
Do you want it?

738
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,419
You're a really good listener.

739
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:35,176
GEORGE:
Oh.

740
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,386
Luce?

741
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,718
Luce?

742
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:44,227
Are you...?
Hello?

743
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,392
Cormac!

744
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,227
Help!

745
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,853
Help!

746
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:03,746
GEORGE:
I'll just get her upstairs.

747
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,577
TONY:
Think you can make it?

748
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,119
No. No, let's put her
somewhere else.

749
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,959

There.

All right.

753
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,974
Good.

754
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,015
She looks so peaceful
when she's asleep.

755
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,646
Like a doll.

A doll with a sinus problem.

758
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,490
We should put a pillow under her head.
I think that helps.

759
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,957

Much worse. Interesting.

762
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,171
Do you think we should change
her clothes?

763
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,179
Right. Don't know where
that came from.

Morning!

765
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,765
Okay, not so loud.

WOMAN:
Hey. How are you, sweety?

767
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,849
We didn't...

768
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,028
Last... We didn't...

769
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,655
it was a magical night.

770
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,989
You made sounds I've never
heard a woman make before.

771
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,868
We didn't...

772
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:31,121
Not physically, but spiritually,
you were the best I've ever had.

773
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,126
Oh.

774
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:40,043
Whatever I did or didn't do
or said or didn't say...

775
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,509
it was all a little mistake.

776
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,341
Well, nothing happened.

777
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,846
That's a relief.

778
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,193
I'm very busy. I have work to do.
You stay there and relax.

779
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,196

Jesus, careful.

782
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,454
There's a June Carver to see you.

783
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,705
- June Carver, June Carver.
NORMAN: She went to Harvard.

784
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,465
Yeah, well, so did I.

- Norman!
- Sorry.

787
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,095
She didn't have a strong background
in property law.

788
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,723
She's down from Boston.
She only wants five minutes.

This is June Carver.

792
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,614
- Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

793
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,652
I don't have an appointment,
so feel free to throw me out.

794
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,492
Well, I have security on standby.

795
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,077
- Have a seat, please.
- Thanks.

796
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,502
Did you have Criminal
with Professor Rappaport?

797
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,379
- Oh, my God. I'm still shaking.
- Yeah.

798
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:03,634
But I have to tell you, Miss Kelson,
you are a legend there.

799
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,794
- Me?
- Editor of the <i>Law Review.</i>

800
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,386
The articles you wrote on the
Richmond case. You're an inspiration.

801
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,100
Well, yeah, I...

802
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,432
I don't have a strong background
in property, but neither did you...

803
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,723
and look what you've accomplished.

804
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,439
Well, you know, not that much, really.
I just...

805
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,603
And there's this.

806
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,272
I've never met Mr. Wade...

807
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,282
but in <i>Public Policy</i> magazine
he was interviewed...

808
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:31,787
about the challenges of urban
development and he said that...

809
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,449
Is it ridiculous that
I'm quoting this?

810
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,075
No, not yet.

811
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:40,497
"Architecture can shape a community
and turn strangers into neighbors.

812
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:43,291
The right design for a park
makes people feel secure.

813
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,131
A school building can be functional
and beautiful...

814
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,638
so kids feel engaged instead
of imprisoned."

815
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,971
When I read that, it made me feel
I'd be working for a cause...

816
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,225
not just a company.

817
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,607
Okay. You're hired.

818
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,317
You're Mr. Wade.

819
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,694
Someone has to be.
Although, I didn't write that.

820
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,355
- Lucy did.
- No, you did. I remember being shocked.

821
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:10,159
We've been working together so long
it's hard to remember who did what.

822
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,820
- Sounds like an amazing team.
- George, do you mind...?

823
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:17,709
I was saying how presumptuous it was
of me to come waltzing in here...

824
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,039
but Miss Kelson was
nice enough to see me.

825
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,125
They're calling from
the Zoning Commission.

826
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:27,670
June, why don't we set up
a proper interview for tomorrow.

827
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:32,591
It's all right. It's all right.
I could finish up with June.

828
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,679
You're not coming to the meeting?

829
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,311
- Have I ever come to the meeting?
LUCY: Good point.

830
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,394
- Alrighty.
GEORGE: Alrighty.

831
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,900
Stupid plant. Do something
with this, will you?

832
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,561
Absolutely. The ficus is fired.

833
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,696
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

834
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,528
- So tell me...
- Yes.

835
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,443
- ...first of all, you come from which...?
JUNE: Harvard.

836
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,538
I was just wondering, are we still
on for the Mets game tonight?

837
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,495
I love baseball.

838
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,368
So are we still good?

839
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,707
I'm a Red Sox fan, all the way.

840
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,089
A Red Sox fan?
Interesting.

841
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:09,878
You obviously have a rich fantasy life
which is a fabulous plus in this company.

842
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:14,049
Okay, that means you're a Boston girl,
probably a little bit Irish, Catholic...

843
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,592
big family, dirty, that kind.
JUNE: Exactly.

844
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:20,980
CROWD: Let's go, Mets! Let's go, Mets!
Let's go, Mets!

845
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,185
MAN:
Strike him out!

846
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,442
LUCY:
So, what did you think of June?

847
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,692
GEORGE:
Loved her.

848
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,694
Great. Yeah, me too.

849
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,402
Yeah, she smiled obsequiously,
flattered me constantly.

850
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,194
She'd have no problem picking out
an ottoman. Exactly what I'm looking for.

851
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:36,616
LUCY: A tad weak
on the experience side, but...

852
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,907
We went out for a drink,
talked for an hour.

853
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:43,249
She's a very clever girl,
you know. Sharp.

854
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,923
- So you guys went out for a drink...
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

855
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,882
She got nowhere to stay at the moment,
so I found her a room at the Grand.

856
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:56,299
And I invited her to the company outing.
Turns out she's a useful tennis player.

857
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:00,060
Well, I can swing a racket.

858
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,267
Yes, I know, at my head.
I've experienced it.

859
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,478
But listen, thanks to you
for finding her. Genius.

860
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:08,565
LUCY: Oh, God!
It's gonna hit us!

Get out of the way. Move!

862
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,941

MIKE: Yeah.

863
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,952
GEORGE: Easy, the season just started.
MIKE: Thanks, George.

He liked her, that is a big
strike against her.

891
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:12,503
Although I will say she's an excellent
tennis player. Very nice form.

you liked her too.

00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,499
Plenty of other pebbles on the beach.
The world is be full of men who'd die...

907
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,255
to be with a compulsive
eater who can't fall in love.

908
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,837
What? I've fallen in love.

909
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,673
- Yeah?
- Yes!

910
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,429
With whom, might I ask?

911
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,680
And no pets.

912
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,140
Billy Westhouse.

913
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,899
Billy who?

914
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:20,188
Westhouse.
I knew him in high school.

915
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,607
Did you tell Billy that you loved him?

916
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:26,323
Did you say, "Billy, I love you"?

917

(GROANS)

918
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,587
Ow!

919
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,582
Goodness!

920
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:40,920
It's not funny.

921
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,175
Sorry.

922
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:46,714
That last chili dog is really barking.

923
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,097
GEORGE:
Yes.

924
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:51,135
It's not perfect timing, I must say.

925
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,185
Don't panic. We'll be
in the city in 20 minutes.

926
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,568
I don't have 20 seconds!
I feel like I swallowed a cruise missile.

927
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,570
Listen, if you've got to go, go.

928
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:06,404
What...? What am I?
5 years old? This is my car!

929
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,410
- It's only a Volvo.
- Well, people just don't go in Volvos!

930
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,947
- I'll buy you another Volvo.
- No!

931
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:14,742
That'll be the only thing you'll ever
remember about me.

932
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,957
I'll be the woman who went
on the front seat!

933
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,589
That would be hard to forget.

(LUCY WHINING)

935
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,088
Okay, I have an idea.
See that RV?

936
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,384
LUCY: Yes.
GEORGE: That is our target.

937
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,760
Can you make it?
Therein lies your salvation.

938
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,645
- No.
- Yes, it's an excellent idea.

939
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,852
- It's unclean!
- It's a brain wave.

940
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,312
- I can hold it!
- Out!

941
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:45,026
LUCY: I can hold it! George,
I'm holding it! I'm fine, I can hold it!

942
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:51,162
No! No, no, George, I don't want...
I'm not going. I'm holding!

943
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,580
Come on.

944
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,535
Hi there!

945
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,514
GEORGE: You all right?
LUCY: Yes.

946
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,845
GEORGE: Okay?
- I'm good.

947
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:15,352
GEORGE: You all right?
- I'm good.

948
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,853
GEORGE: What?
- My ankle.

949
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:20,482
No! No, no!
Oh, God! No!

950
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,444
Hi, there!

951
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,656
LUCY:
Oh, God!

952
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,911
GEORGE:
Sorry to bother you.

953
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,495
I'm not insane, but my friend needs
to use a bathroom. It's an emergency.

954
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,658
- I'll give you $100.
- A thousand!

955
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,997
Okay.

956
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,662

Thanks. Very sweet of you.

Thank you.

Clean, clean, clean.

Where are you guys from?

01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:25,839
Well, Kentucky originally,
but now this is pretty much home.

01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,544

Come here, babies.

01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,840
Hurry!

LUCY:
Oh.

966
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,270
What kind of mileage do you get
out of this thing? It's an RV, right?

967
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,931
A recreational vehicle?

968
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,768
Traffic's moving

969
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,528
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it one sec!

Are you nearly ready?

Yes, poor jerk.

Whoa, Nelly.

LUCY:
George, where's the car?

978
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,764
I'm sure it's been safely
towed by now.

979
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,301
Oh, God!
George, George, George!

980
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:23,688
Don't worry, don't worry! In many ways,
it was the perfect end to the day.

981
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,975
Except for those poor
children in the trailer.

982
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,109
They actually looked
quite frightened.

(CHUCKLES)

984
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:31,821
Don't worry,
I won't tell anyone.

985
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:36,110
Once it's published in the company
newsletter, there'd be no point.

All right, I'll call for a lift.

987

Would you like to have
your nails done?

988
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,669
A Hollywood tan, perhaps?

LUCY:
God, it is such a beautiful city.

990
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,636
GEORGE: My favorite building
of all time. Look.

991
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,639
Nirosta steel, sunburst tower,
gleaming gargoyles...

992
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,476
all designed by a man
called William Van Alen...

993
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,857
obsessed with beating
his former partner...

994
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,110
who was building the
Bank of Manhattan tower at 927 feet.

995
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:56,194
So Van Alen announced
the Chrysler Building at 925 feet...

996
01:02:56,356 --> 01:03:00,406
and then surreptitiously assembled
the 180-foot mast inside the tower...

997
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,538
and revealed it after the bank
tower had been completed...

998
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,371
giving Van Alen the tallest
building for three months...

999
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,161
until of course...
- Until the Empire State Building.

1000
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:18,337
All right, please give me the name
of Van Alen's former partner.

1001
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,553
Who is H. Craig Severance?

1002
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:30,392
- I find you annoying.
- Yes, I'm sure you do.

1003
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,647
But it is pretty amazing what dreams
and lots of money can do, isn't it?

1004
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,944
Yes, it is.

1005
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:43,449
- You know you're part of that, George.
- Yes, I am.

1006
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:47,583
All you have to do is use your
power for good instead of evil.

1007
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,539
If only I would.

1008
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:54,631
Listen...

1009
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,670
I'm very sorry that these last couple
of months have been unbearable for you.

1010
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,381
Not at all.
Unbearable would have been bearable.

1011
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:06,802
Then I suppose it's a good thing
that your two weeks are almost up.

1012
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,266
This is it.

1013
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:12,729
I'll do the Children's League benefit.
I'll make sure June is set up.

1014
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,189
I'll look at your speech
for the groundbreaking...

1015
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,400
and I'll be out of
your life forever.

1016
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,527
Great.

1017
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,691
Super.

01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,716
- Hi.
- Hey, hey.

1019
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,811
- I have tennis elbow from the other day.
- Oh, yes?

1020
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,761
Lucy has tennis forehead.
Much worse.

1021
01:04:52,787 --> 01:04:56,092
Oh, no. I still feel
terrible about that.

1022
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,482
- Thank God she looks okay.
- Hmm.

1023
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,819
Especially with that big benefit
you're all going to tonight.

1024
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,404
- What was it again?
- It's a benefit...

1025
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,821
for the New York Children's League.
Lucy makes us give money...

1026
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,866
to help society and get a tax break.
Brilliant.

1027
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,330
- Sounds exciting.
- It would be almost impossible...

1028
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:17,999
to tell you how boring it is. Largely
because it would be too boring.

1029
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:24,297
Well, boring to you might be scintillating
for a girl from Plainview, Wisconsin.

1030
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,839
See you later.

1031
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,803
What about, if you're not busy...

1032
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,519
a bunch of us are going,
do you want to come and be bored?

1033
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,349
- I'd love to.
- All right.

1034
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,774
- All right. See you later.
- Okay.

1035
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,203
Oh, good. These need to go
to Accounting.

1036
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,955
- The loan forms need to be notarized.
NORMAN: I got it.

1037
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:54,960
- Here's the Zoning Commission reports.
- Now you can start with the appraisals...

1038
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,212
Actually, I don't know
how much time I have.

1039
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,374
George sort of asked me to go
to the benefit with him tonight.

1040
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,340
Oh. Great.

1041
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:08,177
I just have to figure out what to wear.
I don't have anything.

1042
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:13,474
- "I don't have anything."
- God, she's nice.

1043
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,901
They're very good muffins.
They just need more fat.

1044
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,608
George, sign these
or we default on five different loans.

1045
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,568
- Take care.
GEORGE: Hang on. Hang on.

1046
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,075
- I need to go over my speech.
- Sorry. I gotta run.

1047
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,782
We'll pick you up at eight
and go through it in the car.

1048
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,912
I asked June to come.
Hope that's all right.

1049
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,166
Oh, that's dandy, but I don't need
a ride. Thanks.

- Wait. You can't...

1058
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,225
This is nonsense.
You can't just decide unilaterally.

1059
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,688

- George.

over the center?

1062

Because it will eat away our profits.</i>

GEORGE:
You're not gonna get one.

1067
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,542
I need you there.

1068
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,833
- I have to consult my schedule.
- No, you won't. It's your job.

1069
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:28,799
You're the public face of the company.
They don't want to see me.

1070
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:32,011
I can't for the life of me think why not.
You're magnificent.

1071
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:36,181
Look, whatever we lose on this deal,
I'm in for half.

1072
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,642
You'll be in for nothing
at the rate you're going.

1073
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:43,106
Expensive divorces, poolside parties
at the hotel for 1000 people...

1074
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:46,738
including fireworks
and a performance by Sting.

1075
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,443
That was one special night.

1076
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:52,531
It was Wendy the concierge's farewell
bash and a good party if I say so myself.

1077
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,619
Look, I know you don't have a clue,
but the economy is not what it was.

1078
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,503
Everything we've got,
all of it, could go.

1079
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,877
Faster than you can imagine.

1080
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,551
We need this built.

1081
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,214
You're our closer and you will
help me close this deal...

1082
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,884
or I will fire you
and take all your stock options.

1083
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,350
And I can't bear to see you like that,
George.

1084
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,436
You will help me close this deal,
George, won't you?

1085
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,603
I'm surprised you have to ask.

1086
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:29,947
I wasn't really asking.

1087
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,866
- You should have gone with George.
- Well, he asked June.

1088
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:40,455
- Not exclusively. He asked you too.
- He asked me too?

1089
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,712
How many women should a man
take to dinner? Maybe in Utah.

1090
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,749
- So you're gonna go alone?
- Sure, why not?

1091
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,924
Hey, I think it's great.

1092
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,677
I was always too scared
to go anywhere alone.

1093
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:56,717
Then I got married.
Now I'll never be alone again.

1094
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:16,328
Check out this situation.
You two kids have fun.

1095
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,830

Mr. and Mrs. Wade, good evening.

1098
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,461
- I hate these things.
- Ridiculous.

1099
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:32,002
Why can't we just give the money
and be done with it?

1100
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,383
Yes, that'd be fun.
Who wants a drink?

1101
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,639
- I'd love champagne.
- We don't want anything.

1102
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,800
- I'll have a Scotch.
GEORGE: Great.

1103
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,015
I'll be right back
with one of the promotional bottles.

1104

TRUMP: Wade.
- Trump.

1105
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:51,063
- I hear Kelson finally dumped you.
- Not exactly, no.

1106
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:54,608
We came to an understanding that she
couldn't bear me for another second.

1107
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,151
Who's the new chief counsel?

1108
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,036
If she's any good,
I'm gonna steal her away.

1109
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,702
I doubt it. She seems
quite loyal to me.

1110
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,287
- Let me be the judge of that.
- All right.

1111
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,794
I'm not intimidated.
I'll even lead you to her.

1112
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,297
She's over there somewhere.

- So that justifies lying.

Since when is helping people and
telling the truth mutually exclusive?

And I'm not crazy about you right now.

LUCY: Hey.
- Hey.

1207
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,882
- What's wrong?
- Thanks for your shoes.

1208
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:43,804
Hold on, lady. Look at me.
What happened?

1209
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,472
- Nothing.
- Something happened.

1210
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:50,143
I've known you since Brownies,
I've never seen you cry.

1211
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,858
Except when Bush won.

1212
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:55,648
Which Bush?

1213
01:18:55,814 --> 01:19:01,036
- Both of them. So maybe you cried twice.
- This is a different George.

MERYL:
I'm sorry.

It's not supposed to be like this.

1216

Maybe it is.

1217

Maybe it's like the philosopher

gives us fully unto ourselves."

It was the best thing I ever did.

you just made...

01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:03,902
and I'm going to really miss
everyone here at Wade.

There are a million memories
I wouldn't trade...

murder, you can find me at Legal Aid.

Well, it was the same
thing you just did.

for everything.

No problem.
Well, good luck with everything.

1248

And I'm sorry about last night.
That was awkward.

1249
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:46,152
- Oh, not at all. Brian was unbelievable.
- I thought it was Barry.

1250
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:52,200
Well, Barry was first, and then
it was Brian, and it was just crowded.

1251
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,500
- I almost forgot my stapler.
- Is that...? Oh, God.

1252
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,630
- What?
- Never mind.

1253
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:01,542
- No, no. What?
- Well, it's just that technically...

1254
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:05,679
the stapler belongs to the company.
- That's right.

1255
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,761
But... No, you know what?
Whatever.

1256
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:11,143
It's... The stapler just goes
way back with me. And I...

1257

Well, no, no. You keep it.
It'll be our little secret.

- Yeah.

Oh. Great, thank you.
Thank you very much.

seven days a week.

- Wow.
- Yeah.

1263
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:26,032
Guess that makes you a workaholic.

1264
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,910
No, actually, those are the hours
when you work with George.

1265
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:32,039
Well, no. I mean,
I can be a workaholic too.

1266
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:36,873
That's why I'm vigilant about separating
my personal and professional life.

1267
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:41,415
Really? Well, I guess that would explain
the late-night meeting in your slip.

- I'm sorry?
- What?

That is absolutely
none of your business.

1270

My God. Fine.
How much does a stapler run?

1271
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,341
Here, here's $10.

1272
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,975
- Ridiculous.
- It's not yours.

1273

What's the matter with you?
Give me my stapler.

1274

- Look.
- You didn't pay for it.

- Give me... You have more of these!
JUNE: It's not your... Oh, my God.

01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:48,184
I'm sitting here eating a piece
of cheesecake made entirely of soy.

1355
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:49,981
And I hate it.

1356
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,110
But I'm eating it.

1357
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:04,697
I'm going to work.
Bye. Good luck.

1358
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,963
LUCY:
The law is clear on this.

1359
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,592
If the landlord has not kept up proper
maintenance, he cannot evict you.

1360
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,094
We will help you, Mrs. Muñez.

1361
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:23,257
Let me run and get you some forms
you can fill out, and we'll get started.

1362
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,105
Well, hello.

1363
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:41,570
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

1364
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:45,783
Polly St. Clair? You interviewed me?
You thought I was having a baby?

1365
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:49,291
Oh, yes.
Yes, Polly. Wow.

1366
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,996
- So you work here now.
- Uh-huh.

1367
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,413
- Terrific. How are you?
- Pregnant.

1368
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:58,133
- I'm not falling for that one again.
- No, I'm really pregnant.

1369
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:01,215
- You can congratulate me now.
- Polly, I was not born yesterday.

1370
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,676
I'm pregnant!
You want to see the damn sonogram?

1371
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,762
LUCY: Mrs. Muñez,
we have two other cases...

1372
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,517
GEORGE:
Hi.

1373
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:13,356
Hi. I'm busy.

1374
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,775
Yes.

1375
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,983
I need your advice
on one last thing...

1376
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:21,614
and I promise you will
never hear from me again.

1377
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:25,323
I just delivered the first speech written
entirely by myself since we met...

1378
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:31,618
and I think I may have blown it,
so I wanted to ask your thoughts.

1379
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,787
Okay.
Then I will read it to you.

1380
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,206
"I'd like to welcome everyone
on this special day.

1381
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,966
Island Towers will bring prestige
to the neighborhood...

1382
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,968
and be part of
Brooklyn's renaissance.

1383
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,380
And we're very pleased
and proud to be here.

1384
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:47,265
Unfortunately,
there is one fly in the ointment.

1385
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,222
You see, I gave my word to someone...

1386
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,354
that we wouldn't knock down
this building behind me.

1387
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:56,062
Normally, and those who know me or
were married to me can attest to this...

1388
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:00,229
my word wouldn't mean very much.
So why does it this time?

1389
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,274
Well, partly because this building
is an architectural gem...

1390
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,568
and deserves to be landmarked.

1391
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:11,582
Partly because people do need a place
to do senior's water ballet and CPR.

1392
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,993
Preferably not together.

1393
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:20,333
But mainly because this person,
despite being unusually stubborn...

1394
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:26,926
and unwilling to compromise
and a very poor dresser, is...

1395
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:29,925
She's...

1396
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:34,855
rather like the building
she loves so much.

1397
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:39,564
A little rough around the edges,
but when you look closely...

1398
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,320
absolutely beautiful.

1399
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,697
And the only one of her kind.

1400
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:55,918
And even though I've said cruel things
and driven her away...

1401
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:58,586
she's become the voice in my head.

1402
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:03,508
And I can't seem to drown her out.

1403
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:09,555
And I don't want to drown her out.

1404
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:16,935
So we are going to keep
the community center.

1405
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,019
Because I gave my word to her...

1406
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,778
and because we gave our word
to the community."

1407
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,739
And I didn't sleep with June.

1408
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:38,793
That's not in the speech, that's me
letting you know that important fact.

1409
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:39,999
Okay.

1410
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,837
What do you think?

1411
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,936
I have to get back to work.

1412
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,189
GEORGE:
Right.

1413
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:10,947
Right, yes, yes, yes.
Sorry to disturb.

1414
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,408
Congratulations again, Polly.

1415
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:49,106
Aside from the split infinitive
that was somewhere in the middle...

1416
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:53,152
that speech was actually
quite perfect, wasn't it?

1417
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:57,243
Yeah. I don't know what the hell
you're still doing sitting here.

1418
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,783
And I don't even like him.

1419
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,186
George!

1420
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,484
Oh.

1421
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:47,585
LUCY: George, I just want
to say thank you.

1422
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,542
Thank you and I know
I can be harsh and demanding...

1423
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:53,803
but I want to try and change
because I believe people can change.

1424
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:58,058
I can change and not be so demanding
and, you know, like, meet you halfway.

1425
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:01,311
I just... I know... Things just...

1426
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,393
Once I...

1427
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:08,439
GEORGE:
Lucy...

1428
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:11,605
I am in love with you.

1429
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,576
And I'm in love with you.

1430
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,874
Oh, I should just mention
that I have resigned...

1431
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,748
and am now poor.
- Good.

1432
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:34,420
When I say poor, I mean we may have to
share a helicopter with another family.

1433
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:36,259
Does that work for you?

1434
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:40,051
As long as I don't have to
work for you, we will be fine.

1435
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:41,843
Excellent.

1436
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:46,891
And now I would very much like to discuss
that whole bobcat-pretzel thing.

1437
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,895
Oh, I was just kidding.
I'm allergic to bobcats, actually.

1438
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,566
I'm very sorry to hear that.

1439
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:57,734
- But I can do the pretzel.
- That's excellent news.

1440
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,152
Hi, Mr. Wong,
it's Lucy Kelson.

1441
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:45,995
I need one number 13,
two number sevens...

1442
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,831
I can't believe how small
this apartment is. It's shocking.

1443
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:54,500
I need three number
eights, no garlic.

1444
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:57,636
It's good your parents went to
the movies. We'd never fit.

1445
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:03,096
I need one number seven and...

1446
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:06,728
I can walk from one side of this
apartment to the other in six seconds.

1447
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:12,188
- Watch this. One...
- And a number 11, please.

1448
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,819
No, actually this is for two.

1449
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:09,730
