1
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:06,730
Some call Bregna the perfect society.

2
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:11,109
Some call it
the height of human civilization.

3
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:15,781
But others know better.

4
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:21,870
The Goodchilds built Bregna
to ensure us a future.

5
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,876
They built the Relical...

6
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:31,255
a memorial to remind us
of what we've survived.

7
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:36,885
They built walls to protect us.

8
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:43,684
They tell us that outside,
nature has retaken the world.

9
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:52,359
But the real problems lie within.

10
00:02:57,156 --> 00:03:00,117
We are haunted
by sorrows we cannot name.

11
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,828
People disappear...

12
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,248
and our government
denies these crimes.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,503
The Goodchild regime provides for us,
as long as we stay quiet.

14
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,925
So we trade freedom for a gilded cage.

15
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:21,763
But there are rebels
who refuse to make that trade...

16
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:26,101
who fight to overthrow a government
that silences us...

17
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:30,814
who fight in the name of the disappeared.

18
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:38,030
They call themselves the Monicans.

19
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,076
I am one of them.

20
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,231
Handler.

21
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:55,649
Aeon.

22
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,860
We have an assignment.

23
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:03,115
We want you to sabotage Goodchild's
central surveillance facility.

24
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:08,537
Your entry will be noticed, but we will
briefly disrupt their interior alarms.

25
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:12,416
Surveillance is their greatest tool
against us.

26
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,253
As long as Monicans can be seen,
we can be targeted.

27
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:19,339
We need you to blind them.

28
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:25,762
Each mission brings us closer
to defeating the Goodchild regime.

29
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:34,271
This is my daughter.
Have you seen her?

30
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:36,356
She disappeared two months ago.

31
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,943
Help me, please, miss.
Have you seen this girl?

32
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,903
She disappeared two months ago.

33
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,990
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

34
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,492
Visit our sleep center for help.

35
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:52,330
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?
Visit our sleep...

36
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:54,207
Shopping for me, Una?

37
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,586
Haven't you heard?
It's a special occasion.

38
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,255
My sister's finally coming to dinner.

39
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:03,300
Claudius and I
are looking forward to tonight.

40
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:06,511
For once, you'll be in the house
long enough to sit down.

41
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:09,097
That's why
I wanted to meet with you here.

42
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:11,349
Aeon.

43
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:13,643
I may not make it tonight, I'm sorry.

44
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:16,980
Don't be upset.

45
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:19,357
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

46
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:21,526
It's why.

47
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:24,029
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

48
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:26,531
We have different ways
of solving problems.

49
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:29,242
Yes. You ignore them.

50
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:31,870
How could I possibly ignore them?

51
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,372
Excuse me. This is my daughter.

52
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:39,044
I see the problems. I feel them.

53
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:43,298
And I'm trying
to make something good out of it.

54
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,511
- A life.
- What kind of life is it?

55
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:53,266
There are good things here.

56
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:57,854
There's one.

57
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,695
- So I have a surprise for you.
- Tell me.

58
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,198
Tonight.

59
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:12,369
So be careful.

60
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:15,080
And come back.

61
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,376
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

62
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:21,628
Visit our sleep center for help.

63
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:25,423
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

64
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,384
Visit our sleep center for help.

65
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:46,379
Possible Monican consort.
Three subjects.

66
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:49,633
Identification requested.

67
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:53,178
Possible Monican activity suspected.

68
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:03,772
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

69
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:04,856
It's why.

70
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,943
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

71
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:16,159
I think we have different ways
of solving problems.

72
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:19,329
This is the way things are
and I'm trying...

73
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:22,165
to make something good out of it. A life.

74
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:17,679
You're early, Claudius.

75
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:32,902
But they're everywhere.

76
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:35,238
We need to protect you from them.

77
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,930
This is how Chairman Goodchild
deals with Monicans.

78
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:02,515
But she wasn't...

79
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,226
She wasn't a Monican.

80
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:22,577
I had a family once.

81
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,999
I had a life.

82
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,380
Now all I have is a mission.

83
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,602
Una.

84
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Aeon.

85
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,441
Aeon, Una.

86
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:54,818
Aeon.

87
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:56,319
Come back.

88
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:43,575
Yes.

89
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,119
She will see you now.

90
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,426
Handler.

91
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:03,052
Aeon.

92
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:05,096
We have an assignment.

93
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:07,473
One you've been waiting for.

94
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:08,892
Goodchild.

95
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:13,271
We've intercepted information that
will allow us to penetrate his security.

96
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,066
We want you to eliminate him.

97
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,611
You should've sent me in earlier.

98
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,655
- That would've been suicide.
- Not for me.

99
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,907
Patience, Aeon.

100
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,951
It has taken a year
to get the information we need.

101
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:29,245
I know you want to do this for Una.

102
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,916
But you must remember,
this is larger than you.

103
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,920
She's not the only innocent person
who's been killed.

104
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,633
This is our moment.

105
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,010
We have never been stronger.

106
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,888
People are frightened, yes...

107
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:49,057
but if we show them the way...

108
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:51,392
they will rise behind us when he's gone.

109
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:53,436
I'm ready.

110
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,452
Tomorrow, Goodchild will be preparing
his address to the Council.

111
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:14,165
To reach the government zone, you
will need to cross the frontier garden.

112
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:18,544
Once you are through the garden,
you must move quickly to the Citadel.

113
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:22,799
The underground interior has been built
to be confusing.

114
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:26,552
We've implanted a route for you.
Follow it.

115
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,555
I want Sithandra with me for the crossing.

116
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:32,225
Of course. Get to the Forum.

117
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,310
That's where
Chairman Goodchild will be.

118
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,271
You know what to do from there.

119
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,648
Yes.

120
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:42,986
Do this and you will have your revenge.

121
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,571
And we will all have our victory.

122
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,298
Hello, Sithandra.

123
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,346
- Still can't surprise you.
- Not yet.

124
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,185
How are the modifications?

125
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:27,280
Useful.

126
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,407
You should have it done.

127
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,200
I like my shoes.

128
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:40,251
Warning. End of civilian zone.
Do not proceed.

129
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:49,260
Warning. Do not proceed.

130
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:50,511
Ready?

131
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:52,680
Always.

132
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:54,974
Warning. Do not proceed.

133
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,297
- Sithandra.
- Let's keep moving.

134
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,801
- We understand these now?
- Completely.

135
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,569
I'd keep off the grass.

136
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:21,287
- Rendezvous at 1620.
- I'll be waiting.

137
00:19:23,141 --> 00:19:26,352
I agree with the policy
of targeting proven Monican threats.

138
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:28,938
But I'm afraid we're going too far.

139
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:31,232
We can't go too far with them.

140
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,989
There are advantages
to showing a degree of leniency.

141
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:41,659
We can't allow them the luxury of hope.
Not even one of them.

142
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,078
Brute force isn't the only option.

143
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,621
It's an effective one.

144
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,416
The Monicans are growing strong.
Soon, force won't be enough.

145
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:50,960
So you want to compromise?
Negotiate?

146
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,504
The policy should be reconsidered.

147
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:57,591
- Put to a vote.
- The policy is not up for debate!

148
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:00,970
I'm debating it!

149
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:07,143
I'd encourage you to look at this
with a little more detachment, Giroux.

150
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:10,271
Here, we must be impersonal.

151
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:15,568
You wouldn't want me to take
your outburst personally, would you?

152
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:35,671
That is all.

153
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,759
Oren?

154
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,604
I'm getting worried about you, Oren.
This edge you've taken.

155
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,522
Displays like that aren't helpful to us.

156
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,734
I believe in protecting what we've created.
I won't apologize for that.

157
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,320
This was created
to allow me to do my work.

158
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:02,281
I can't do that
if you can't control yourself.

159
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:05,868
- Understood.
- Is it?

160
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,037
Yes.

161
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:13,542
- And what about the test results?
- All negative.

162
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:17,713
Sorry.

163
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:20,174
Find me a new test group by morning.

164
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:23,886
Maybe it's time
to give up on the tests, Trevor.

165
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,723
We're living the solution already.
This is perfection.

166
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:31,060
- Why can't you just embrace it?
- You see what's happening to people.

167
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:32,937
You know how desperate this has become.

168
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:35,606
It can be contained. Controlled.

169
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:39,527
I think you're forgetting
that this was all meant to be temporary.

170
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:42,405
We've always said that,
but why should it be?

171
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:43,823
Because it's wrong.

172
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:45,408
Things change.

173
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,327
But I know you won't.

174
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:50,579
You know me.

175
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:52,456
I've been your brother a long time.

176
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,917
You're right about that.

177
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:56,752
Trevor, your speech.

178
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:00,297
Trevor...

179
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:20,401
Useless.

180
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:38,794
- State destination.
- Forum.

181
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:41,797
Proceed forward.

182
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:49,221
Proceed left.

183
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,184
I know you have fears.

184
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:57,480
You have sorrows that shake your belief
and try your patience.

185
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:00,774
But now more than ever,
we must stand together...

186
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,985
because there are those among us...

187
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:05,654
who would tear down what we have built.

188
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:08,407
The Monicans seek to divide us.

189
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:10,826
We must never forget who we are...

190
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:13,829
a lonely outpost, a tiny band.

191
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:18,125
We're all that remains of a people
that once covered the Earth.

192
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,086
We must adapt together
to these new challenges.

193
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,467
Remember what we have faced,
what we have survived.

194
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:28,844
We will adapt.

195
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:34,642
We have always adapted.

196
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,360
It's the fabric of who we are.

197
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:55,704
Katherine.

198
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:11,387
It's you.

199
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:30,906
Katherine.

200
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:23,834
Wait outside.

201
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:37,014
Aeon.

202
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:40,059
You called me by another name earlier.

203
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:42,895
I did, and you let me live.

204
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:46,315
Give me my gun. We'll try it again.

205
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:48,275
Maybe later.

206
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,362
What was that name?

207
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:55,824
You know me, don't you?

208
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:57,284
No.

209
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:00,162
Do you know who you are?

210
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,541
- I know I came here to kill you.
- That's why you're in a cell.

211
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:09,171
But we're both still alive for a reason.

212
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:16,720
I don't know what this is...

213
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:21,517
but it's good to see you.

214
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:00,556
Amateurs.

215
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,458
Good boys.

216
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:45,202
- Aeon.
- Little busy, Sithandra.

217
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:46,662
Is it done?

218
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:50,082
I need more time.

219
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,334
Our information on him may be wrong.

220
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:55,337
I don't understand this.
We have to move. I hope you--

221
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:57,881
Don't question me, Sithandra.

222
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:00,759
I'll contact you soon.

223
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,720
Aeon, you know
there will be consequences to this.

224
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:05,764
I know what I'm doing.

225
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,685
This is outrageous.

226
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:11,937
One Monican eluding all of our defenses?

227
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,438
The problem will be taken care of.

228
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:15,858
The problem is
Trevor's concept of security.

229
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:18,026
He needs to learn to accept
more traditional--

230
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:20,362
He needs to learn to accept our input.

231
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:23,615
Another example of him pursuing his
own agenda, no matter what we think.

232
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:26,535
- I'm beginning to question his agenda.
- Meaning?

233
00:29:26,703 --> 00:29:29,204
The Monican tries to kill him
and he lets her live?

234
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:30,706
An unusual choice.

235
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:32,916
And now she's escaped.

236
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,668
Does anyone believe this is a coincidence?

237
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,587
Do you really think
that I'm a sympathetic ear...

238
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:38,755
for your complaints about Trevor?

239
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,759
You don't have the right
to question what he does.

240
00:29:42,886 --> 00:29:44,970
You must be concerned, Oren.

241
00:29:45,972 --> 00:29:47,472
This is hardly routine.

242
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,893
I think I should talk with Trevor.

243
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:53,896
And I think
all of you should be more discreet.

244
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:57,858
Inari?

245
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:03,989
Image retrieval commencing.

246
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:05,991
What happened?

247
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:07,784
My sources were clear on this.

248
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:10,037
Aeon Flux is the best the Monicans have.

249
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:12,873
- She failed.
- It's the first time she has.

250
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,958
I wanted this done cleanly.

251
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:19,212
- My brother...
- Will be vulnerable.

252
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:21,590
Preparing his speech....

253
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:23,759
Tomorrow, 1300...

254
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:28,305
It can't be traced to you, in any case.

255
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,223
That's comforting.

256
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:32,309
We did everything correctly.

257
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:35,062
- She had her opportunity.
- And she stopped.

258
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:36,605
Why?

259
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:41,652
- I don't know.
- Image retrieval underway.

260
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:44,279
It'll be too risky to call another hit.

261
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:47,282
The Monicans may suspect
they are being used.

262
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,079
Stop.

263
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:55,457
Oren?

264
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,459
No.

265
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,963
That's impossible.

266
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:15,018
Claudius.

267
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:20,691
- Why are you still here?
- It's not as simple as you think.

268
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:24,611
Una is murdered and you keep working
for the people who did it?

269
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:26,822
- What should I be thinking?
- You don't know.

270
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,740
What don't I know?

271
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:30,909
They killed her.

272
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:34,162
- And you're still alive.
- You killed her, Aeon.

273
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,416
They thought she was a Monican,
that's why she died.

274
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,837
- Una's life was worth more than that.
- She was all I had.

275
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,674
You're not the only one.

276
00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:51,304
What are you
really doing here, Claudius?

277
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:53,515
Working.

278
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:56,601
It's all that's left.

279
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:59,062
Working. For Trevor Goodchild.

280
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,024
I blamed him, too.

281
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:04,109
But now
I don't think it was Trevor's fault.

282
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,278
Trevor's trying to help.

283
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:10,365
Something is wrong with us, Aeon.
With everybody.

284
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:13,827
You have the dreams, don't you?

285
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:16,747
Memories of things
that never happened to you?

286
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:19,166
Una had them. I have them.

287
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,334
It's happening all across Bregna.

288
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:23,503
- What is it?
- I don't know.

289
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:26,214
They only tell us what we need to know.

290
00:32:26,382 --> 00:32:28,717
My work is a small part
of a larger experiment.

291
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:31,511
- Whose experiment?
- Trevor's.

292
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:35,307
We're studying
what's growing outside the wall.

293
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:39,227
Something happened
when they cured the industrial disease.

294
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:41,897
Something else sprung up in its place.

295
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,982
We're sick.

296
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:47,986
And Trevor's trying to cure us.
That's all I know.

297
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,534
Trevor tried to dope me.

298
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,453
Tell me what's in this.

299
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,295
It's a message.

300
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:07,422
Well, what does it say?

301
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,842
You have to drink it.
That's how it works.

302
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:16,515
I loved her.

303
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:21,436
You know that.

304
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:42,499
Aeon.

305
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:47,963
I'm sorry for the pain,
but it's not safe to talk in the open.

306
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:51,133
Nothing is as it seems.

307
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:56,221
You had your chance.
Why did you hesitate?

308
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:02,144
You know where to find me.

309
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:34,676
- Why am I here?
- I needed to see you again.

310
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:37,179
You killed my sister.

311
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:39,806
I didn't know anything about it.

312
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:41,850
I'm sorry.

313
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:44,144
- And that excuses you?
- No.

314
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:47,522
But this is a war.
People on all sides die.

315
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:50,859
She shouldn't have.
She had nothing to do with this.

316
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:55,071
- Everyone is involved in this.
- She wasn't.

317
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:01,077
I don't need that to kill you.

318
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:03,371
But it would be easier, wouldn't it?

319
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,045
Everything changed when I saw you.

320
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,799
I know you. And you know me.

321
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,721
Why do I know you? Why?

322
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:24,392
Why did you come back?

323
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:28,271
- What do you want from me?
- What do I want?

324
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:30,398
I want my sister back.

325
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,902
I want to remember
what it feels like to be a person.

326
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:42,577
Aeon.

327
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:45,747
Why do I feel this way around you?

328
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:48,393
Katherine...

329
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,271
You know me.

330
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:54,274
I want you to eliminate him.

331
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:56,693
Come back.

332
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:00,363
I'm not who you think I am, Aeon.

333
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,045
Something is missing here.

334
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:06,341
We identified the variables
that compromised test group 7A.

335
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,553
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

336
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:12,096
It's just a matter of time...

337
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:15,391
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

338
00:40:45,673 --> 00:40:46,923
Found you.

339
00:42:51,924 --> 00:42:54,008
No permanent damage here, Chairman.

340
00:42:57,971 --> 00:42:59,389
You may leave.

341
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:04,519
She's escaped.

342
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,313
Why am I not surprised?

343
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:09,357
I found her in the library.

344
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:11,567
- I think I wounded her, but--
- You attacked her?

345
00:43:12,194 --> 00:43:14,570
She's a Monican agent
who tried to kill you.

346
00:43:14,697 --> 00:43:16,447
I assumed it was obvious
what I should do.

347
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:19,033
Freya, I want her alive.
Do you understand?

348
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:26,958
Is Oren aware of this?

349
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,127
I can't find him.

350
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:31,254
Stay close.

351
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,013
No matter what Trevor's done for us
in the past, he's not above reproach.

352
00:43:41,598 --> 00:43:42,598
This is treason.

353
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,060
Oren?

354
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:51,607
Trevor has been moving away from us
for a long time.

355
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:55,361
What we've built here
is larger than him.

356
00:43:58,574 --> 00:44:02,702
I never thought it would come to this,
but we have to face the truth.

357
00:44:04,037 --> 00:44:07,165
He chose that Monican
and he knew what that would mean.

358
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:09,125
He must be removed.

359
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:11,294
And Oren is next in line.

360
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:14,756
Isn't that right?

361
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,592
Yes.

362
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:20,261
It's done, then.

363
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:23,389
Mr. Chairman.

364
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:28,436
Trevor has betrayed all of us.

365
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:32,523
He's a criminal.

366
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:35,610
We'll treat him as one.

367
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:40,031
...test group 7A.

368
00:44:40,616 --> 00:44:44,619
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

369
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:46,037
It's just a matter of time...

370
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:49,290
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

371
00:44:51,627 --> 00:44:55,087
Review progress of subjects
from test group 7B...

372
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,800
Sandrin Veems, Greta Salk, Una Flux.

373
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:02,053
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

374
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:04,931
8.26, 7.19.

375
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:09,101
Greta Salk, Una Flux.

376
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:12,313
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

377
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:15,233
8.26, 7.19.

378
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:21,489
Collect additional samples
from Relical strands 5.88.

379
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:27,995
You're certainly killing him kindly.

380
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,834
The situation has changed.

381
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:34,669
Our orders haven't.

382
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:37,839
I'm not following orders anymore.

383
00:45:38,841 --> 00:45:40,967
Why are you doing this, Aeon?

384
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:43,678
Everything has become more complicated.

385
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:45,096
No, it's simple.

386
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,306
Trevor may not be responsible for Una's death.

387
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:50,768
- Trevor?
- I'm trying to find out who is.

388
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:55,731
Your mission was to kill Goodchild
and you can't or won't do that. So...

389
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:01,863
Give me your weapon
and return across the frontier.

390
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:05,908
- Didn't I teach you to think for yourself?
- You taught me a lot more than that.

391
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,495
Please!

392
00:46:10,038 --> 00:46:12,039
I can hurt you if I have to.

393
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,710
Don't you feel something wrong
inside you?

394
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:17,503
Sithandra, I'm....

395
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:23,259
I don't know who I am.

396
00:46:26,346 --> 00:46:28,097
You feel it, too, don't you?

397
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:31,350
Come with me.

398
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:34,896
We'll finish the mission together.

399
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:41,944
I can't.

400
00:47:59,106 --> 00:48:00,982
This sort of thing used to be fun.

401
00:48:01,942 --> 00:48:03,901
Now what do I do with you?

402
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,360
Katherine.

403
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:50,823
Come back.

404
00:50:32,217 --> 00:50:36,804
07.4.872.

405
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:40,391
Noted. Returned to stream.

406
00:50:41,393 --> 00:50:43,310
Gregor Plitzen.

407
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:48,566
70.5.872.

408
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,194
Noted. Returned to stream.

409
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:55,406
Suki Denali.

410
00:50:56,199 --> 00:51:00,786
02.4.875.

411
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:03,789
Noted. Returned to stream.

412
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:11,922
Welcome back.

413
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,087
Una Flux.

414
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:57,259
32.4.870.

415
00:51:58,053 --> 00:51:59,303
Collected.

416
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:05,643
Successfully reassigned as Sasha Prillo.

417
00:52:06,228 --> 00:52:07,144
Repeat.

418
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:13,025
Una Flux. Reassigned as Sasha Prillo.

419
00:52:16,446 --> 00:52:18,739
Sasha Prillo. Address.

420
00:52:19,282 --> 00:52:22,701
Sasha Prillo. Address.

421
00:52:54,109 --> 00:52:55,276
Handler.

422
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:56,652
Sithandra.

423
00:52:57,112 --> 00:52:58,946
Goodchild is still alive.

424
00:52:59,322 --> 00:53:00,614
Aeon failed?

425
00:53:01,283 --> 00:53:02,741
She let him live.

426
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:05,953
There's something between them.

427
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,163
Something personal.

428
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:09,873
Explain.

429
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,875
She abandoned the mission.

430
00:53:12,168 --> 00:53:15,754
I tried to stop her,
and she attacked me and left me here.

431
00:53:17,424 --> 00:53:19,550
Are you secure where you are?

432
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:22,219
Fairly.

433
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,680
Help is coming.

434
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:27,975
Aeon Flux is now considered a fugitive.

435
00:53:28,935 --> 00:53:32,479
She has betrayed the resistance
and must be considered a threat.

436
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:36,150
She has aligned herself with Goodchild
and is with him now.

437
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:38,027
We must move quickly.

438
00:53:39,321 --> 00:53:41,155
You will eliminate her.

439
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:44,450
Kill her and then complete her mission.

440
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:48,203
Sithandra, show them where you are.

441
00:53:55,628 --> 00:53:56,795
Do you see?

442
00:53:58,256 --> 00:54:00,007
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:54:00,175 --> 00:54:01,175
Yes.

444
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:04,762
Extricate her and proceed from there.

445
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:14,104
Trevor?

446
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:28,660
It's her.

447
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:30,371
Yes.

448
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:34,625
- She was here.
- What was she looking for?

449
00:54:35,418 --> 00:54:36,627
Her sister.

450
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:39,671
Una.

451
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:56,313
Una Flux.

452
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,109
Scroll down.

453
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:03,821
Member of test group 7B.

454
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,739
Show me all of 7B.

455
00:55:08,243 --> 00:55:09,868
Sandrin Veems.

456
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:12,663
Member of 7B.

457
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:15,332
Killed in police action.

458
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:19,837
Where is she?

459
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,296
Greta Salk.

460
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,091
Member of 7B.

461
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:26,718
Killed in police action.

462
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:28,137
There's nobody here.

463
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,598
Camille Abdi.

464
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,560
Member of 7B.

465
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:37,396
Killed in police action.

466
00:55:45,905 --> 00:55:47,114
Una Flux.

467
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:49,783
Member of 7B.

468
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:52,828
Killed in police action.

469
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,635
Who did this?

470
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:13,265
All actions authorized
by Adjunct Chairman Oren Goodchild.

471
00:56:15,393 --> 00:56:18,854
Freya, go to my lab,
find the notes from group 7B.

472
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:21,648
You need to get to a safe place.
They're moving against you.

473
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:24,067
- Meet me there in two hours.
- Where are you going?

474
00:56:24,486 --> 00:56:26,945
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor--

475
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:29,323
Freya, I'll see you at the lab.

476
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:32,159
Take care of yourself.

477
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:42,085
Una.

478
00:56:43,254 --> 00:56:44,338
You're right.

479
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:51,303
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- She's safe.

480
00:56:53,598 --> 00:56:55,057
You cloned her?

481
00:56:55,975 --> 00:56:57,684
I cloned everybody.

482
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:04,024
There was a complication
when we cured the industrial disease.

483
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:08,278
The vaccine had
an unintended side effect.

484
00:57:10,365 --> 00:57:11,573
Sterility.

485
00:57:12,492 --> 00:57:15,869
Only one more generation
of our species could survive.

486
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,330
It was a desperate time.

487
00:57:18,498 --> 00:57:19,831
It's our responsibility...

488
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:23,460
Cloning had never been used
on humans successfully.

489
00:57:28,132 --> 00:57:29,716
But we succeeded.

490
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:36,056
Now, when a person dies,
their DNA is recycled.

491
00:57:36,182 --> 00:57:39,226
Oren and I built the Relical
to store the DNA...

492
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:41,270
and conceal the cloning process.

493
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:44,398
The Keeper finds a suitable couple...

494
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:48,652
and, using food additives,
we induce a chemical pregnancy.

495
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:54,408
When the woman comes in for an exam,
we implant a cloned embryo.

496
00:57:54,784 --> 00:57:56,868
From there, things happen naturally.

497
00:57:57,453 --> 00:58:01,164
In nine months,
a citizen who died is reborn.

498
00:58:03,835 --> 00:58:07,004
For seven generations,
Oren and I have cloned ourselves...

499
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:11,174
taught ourselves, so that
I could keep trying to find a cure...

500
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:14,928
while we all live on.

501
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:21,184
That's what we are?

502
00:58:22,437 --> 00:58:23,562
Copies?

503
00:58:24,814 --> 00:58:26,565
We're more than that.

504
00:58:30,653 --> 00:58:33,113
It wasn't supposed to be permanent.

505
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:38,619
I've been trying to cure the infertility.

506
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:44,791
Una was part of one of my test groups.

507
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:47,044
Oren lied to me.

508
00:58:47,378 --> 00:58:50,380
He told me her test had failed
like the others.

509
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:53,216
But she had become pregnant.

510
00:58:56,763 --> 00:58:58,972
He killed all of the subjects.

511
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:01,516
Your sister included.

512
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,813
He killed her
because she was pregnant.

513
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:13,654
Una didn't know it...

514
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,492
but her baby would've been one
of the first new children in 400 years.

515
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:22,162
Oren's changed.

516
00:59:23,748 --> 00:59:26,958
He doesn't want to go back.
He doesn't want a cure.

517
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,878
He wants to live forever.

518
00:59:39,722 --> 00:59:43,350
You must've been expecting this
after helping that Monican.

519
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:49,022
Your loyalty to Trevor
can't protect you anymore.

520
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:52,192
I'm loyal to something deeper
than any of this.

521
00:59:53,069 --> 00:59:55,696
I don't understand
people like you and Trevor.

522
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:58,949
Your sentimentality,
your devotion to the past...

523
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:01,493
to things that are gone.

524
01:00:01,703 --> 01:00:04,204
I couldn't live without those things.

525
01:00:04,997 --> 01:00:06,331
How can you?

526
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,559
Sasha.

527
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:30,564
We should go.
It won't take long for Oren to find us.

528
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:36,570
She's gonna be a handful.

529
01:00:40,867 --> 01:00:42,325
Go. They don't want you.

530
01:00:42,493 --> 01:00:43,452
Go!

531
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:42,213
Down!

532
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,107
No. You need to stay conscious.

533
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:11,993
Please remain calm.

534
01:04:13,037 --> 01:04:15,789
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

535
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:20,293
Please remain calm.

536
01:04:21,212 --> 01:04:24,089
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

537
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:27,467
Please remain calm.

538
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:30,095
We are experiencing...

539
01:04:41,691 --> 01:04:44,150
We can't go to a Monican safe house.

540
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:46,653
Nowhere's going to be safe for us.

541
01:05:02,545 --> 01:05:04,754
We need to get the bullets out.

542
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:44,210
Are you hit anywhere else?

543
01:05:49,508 --> 01:05:51,926
Did any of them manage to miss you?

544
01:06:11,447 --> 01:06:13,948
We might have to go outside the wall.

545
01:06:15,242 --> 01:06:16,409
I know.

546
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,247
First, I have to end this.

547
01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:26,836
I need to go back in.

548
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:30,090
I have to get my notes
from Una's test group.

549
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,095
Oren will find the lab and destroy it,
everything I've done.

550
01:06:50,903 --> 01:06:53,404
All military units should report
to their stations...

551
01:06:53,572 --> 01:06:55,615
and wait for further instructions.

552
01:07:03,207 --> 01:07:04,958
Who's in charge here?

553
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:07,627
We need your help.

554
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:10,296
- We have orders to shoot you on sight.
- There's been a coup.

555
01:07:10,422 --> 01:07:12,966
Your orders are coming
from an illegitimate government.

556
01:07:13,134 --> 01:07:15,677
- Stay where you are, sir!
- What's your name?

557
01:07:16,512 --> 01:07:18,680
- Sir?
- I want to know your name.

558
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:22,809
It's Ord. Garret Ord.

559
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:26,980
I can't command you anymore, Garret.
But neither can they.

560
01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:28,982
You're free.

561
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:31,901
You need to make a decision.

562
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:38,116
Shoot us or help us, but do it quickly.

563
01:07:39,577 --> 01:07:40,660
Lieutenant?

564
01:07:49,378 --> 01:07:51,921
How can I help you,
Chairman Goodchild?

565
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:58,094
We need weapons.
We need to get back into the Citadel.

566
01:07:58,262 --> 01:07:59,429
Yes, sir.

567
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:13,484
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

568
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:15,278
You will be updated frequently.

569
01:08:15,404 --> 01:08:19,407
This is an announcement from the
Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild.

570
01:08:21,577 --> 01:08:25,705
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

571
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:31,836
- We're getting closer.
- Wait.

572
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:53,066
Trevor.

573
01:08:55,486 --> 01:08:57,403
The name you called me...

574
01:09:00,324 --> 01:09:01,574
Katherine.

575
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,244
That was my name.

576
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:09,415
You were my wife.

577
01:09:14,255 --> 01:09:17,257
We had a life together,
just like anybody else.

578
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:18,800
Wait.

579
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:21,844
You need to tell me.

580
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:27,934
I lost you during the disease,
and you couldn't be brought back.

581
01:09:28,602 --> 01:09:31,604
I've lived and died
seven times since then.

582
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,109
And each time
I taught myself about you.

583
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:39,112
You were an idea I kept alive.

584
01:09:39,655 --> 01:09:41,656
Something I had to imagine.

585
01:09:46,954 --> 01:09:48,663
But when I saw you...

586
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:53,334
what I felt was real.

587
01:09:54,295 --> 01:09:55,628
I knew you.

588
01:09:57,464 --> 01:09:58,965
I remembered you.

589
01:09:59,633 --> 01:10:03,553
What we had then survived in us
past death, past everything.

590
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,473
I was looking for you.

591
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:10,393
I've been waiting.

592
01:10:12,104 --> 01:10:14,022
We were different people.

593
01:10:14,898 --> 01:10:16,024
We were.

594
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,609
Those people are gone.

595
01:10:20,446 --> 01:10:22,697
But something in them came back.

596
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:24,991
Yes.

597
01:10:40,883 --> 01:10:42,175
I remember.

598
01:10:44,845 --> 01:10:46,179
It's chaos out there.

599
01:10:46,638 --> 01:10:48,556
There's a coup against Goodchild.

600
01:10:48,682 --> 01:10:50,641
Made it easier to slip in.

601
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:52,268
Did you bring a way to find her?

602
01:10:52,394 --> 01:10:55,438
As long as there's a trace of the pill
in her, we can track her.

603
01:11:05,866 --> 01:11:06,866
No.

604
01:11:25,844 --> 01:11:26,969
Freya.

605
01:11:33,227 --> 01:11:34,477
It's gone.

606
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:38,231
I had cured it.

607
01:11:38,524 --> 01:11:40,400
I'd found the answer.

608
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:42,402
It's all gone.

609
01:11:45,406 --> 01:11:47,240
We have to keep moving.

610
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:58,751
There's still one more thing to do.

611
01:11:59,294 --> 01:12:03,005
There's nothing left to do.
You and I need to get out of here.

612
01:12:04,049 --> 01:12:07,260
We go outside the wall.
We'll find a way to live.

613
01:12:07,386 --> 01:12:10,888
There's one more thing to do.
I need to destroy it.

614
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:12,682
No.

615
01:12:15,352 --> 01:12:16,894
This isn't the answer, Aeon.

616
01:12:17,104 --> 01:12:19,439
There's no guarantee
I can find the cure again.

617
01:12:19,606 --> 01:12:22,525
- The cloning is all we have.
- It's not enough.

618
01:12:23,152 --> 01:12:26,737
Our minds are unraveling, and every
time you bring us back it gets worse.

619
01:12:26,947 --> 01:12:28,823
If you do this, we end.

620
01:12:29,283 --> 01:12:30,658
We're meant to die.

621
01:12:32,536 --> 01:12:35,204
It's what makes
anything about us matter.

622
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:39,584
Living like this is torture.

623
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:41,335
We're just ghosts.

624
01:12:43,589 --> 01:12:45,173
That's not how I feel.

625
01:12:47,468 --> 01:12:48,468
Not now.

626
01:12:56,643 --> 01:12:58,227
Let's be careful.

627
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,855
You know who we're up against.

628
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:10,114
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

629
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,200
It's not for you to decide.

630
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:17,163
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

631
01:13:18,207 --> 01:13:19,832
You don't have to.

632
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:23,169
You'll find the cure again.

633
01:13:24,838 --> 01:13:26,464
It's over, Trevor.

634
01:13:34,014 --> 01:13:36,516
Moving into position on the south spire.

635
01:13:39,353 --> 01:13:41,938
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

636
01:13:42,814 --> 01:13:45,191
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally...

637
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:47,401
outside of your experiments.

638
01:13:47,653 --> 01:13:49,445
More and more of them.

639
01:13:50,614 --> 01:13:52,198
They healed themselves.

640
01:13:53,492 --> 01:13:56,536
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

641
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:58,538
How many?

642
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:04,210
How many, Oren?

643
01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:08,214
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

644
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:13,302
- In position.
- In position.

645
01:14:13,428 --> 01:14:14,720
Position acquired.

646
01:14:15,138 --> 01:14:18,266
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

647
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:23,271
How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

648
01:14:24,898 --> 01:14:26,524
Situation's getting complicated.

649
01:14:33,407 --> 01:14:35,449
You told me she was gone.

650
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,789
There was nothing that they could do.

651
01:14:45,544 --> 01:14:47,628
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

652
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:51,549
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

653
01:14:51,758 --> 01:14:54,427
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

654
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:57,930
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

655
01:14:58,056 --> 01:14:59,056
Yes.

656
01:14:59,349 --> 01:15:01,100
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

657
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:03,811
This world, our world, is beautiful.

658
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:06,272
Worth preserving at any cost.

659
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:08,524
It can't last. It's falling apart.

660
01:15:12,696 --> 01:15:14,572
Sithandra, give us the signal.

661
01:15:16,575 --> 01:15:18,909
- Sithandra.
- Take Flux down first.

662
01:15:19,036 --> 01:15:20,202
You're wrong in this, Oren.

663
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:22,747
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

664
01:15:23,832 --> 01:15:25,249
We've gone beyond you.

665
01:15:26,168 --> 01:15:28,085
And now I need to be free of you.

666
01:15:38,513 --> 01:15:39,639
Wait.

667
01:15:52,736 --> 01:15:53,944
Sithandra.

668
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:00,826
You chose this, Aeon. It's too late.

669
01:16:01,203 --> 01:16:03,204
You know how much we're all suffering.

670
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:05,665
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

671
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,250
I would never betray you.

672
01:16:08,919 --> 01:16:10,044
Help me.

673
01:16:12,297 --> 01:16:13,589
Sithandra.

674
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,425
You still know me.

675
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:17,718
Finish it.

676
01:16:18,845 --> 01:16:20,846
You can choose to trust me.

677
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,519
Finish it.

678
01:16:26,645 --> 01:16:28,396
I'm sorry, Oren.

679
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:29,689
I'm sorry.

680
01:16:29,856 --> 01:16:30,940
I am, too.

681
01:16:35,946 --> 01:16:39,115
Orders have changed.
Cover Aeon. Cover Goodchild.

682
01:17:21,742 --> 01:17:23,033
Goodchild's been hit.

683
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:29,165
Flux is headed to the courtyard.

684
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:34,378
Cover Aeon.

685
01:18:58,547 --> 01:18:59,505
Sithandra!

686
01:19:50,932 --> 01:19:52,016
Oren.

687
01:20:25,926 --> 01:20:27,384
They're coming.

688
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:33,766
Aeon.

689
01:20:53,703 --> 01:20:55,537
We're waiting for your orders.

690
01:20:56,414 --> 01:20:57,748
You're not part of this?

691
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:01,794
Whatever we are, we're not anarchists.

692
01:21:02,295 --> 01:21:04,755
- There have to be rules.
- Thank you.

693
01:21:36,788 --> 01:21:38,205
You're the one.

694
01:21:39,082 --> 01:21:40,499
You saved me.

695
01:21:41,126 --> 01:21:42,126
Yes.

696
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:44,878
I knew you then.

697
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:47,881
This one was corrupted. Destroy it.

698
01:21:48,508 --> 01:21:50,426
I knew you were important.

699
01:21:50,927 --> 01:21:52,344
The DNA is good.

700
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:54,138
Destroy it.

701
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:02,521
I knew that I needed to protect you.

702
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:09,028
I kept your DNA hidden here, dormant.

703
01:22:09,154 --> 01:22:11,447
I've waited until now to bring you back.

704
01:22:12,198 --> 01:22:13,073
Why?

705
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:18,370
I knew that your strength
would survive with you.

706
01:22:18,788 --> 01:22:22,541
I thought that if I brought you back,
you could reach Trevor.

707
01:22:24,044 --> 01:22:25,627
You always could.

708
01:22:27,005 --> 01:22:29,882
- I have to end it.
- Yes.

709
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:32,259
Start over.

710
01:22:33,178 --> 01:22:34,386
What about you?

711
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,017
I've waited 400 years for this day.

712
01:22:43,438 --> 01:22:44,855
I'm tired.

713
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:53,697
Stay alive, Aeon.

714
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:57,534
You are needed.

715
01:23:49,838 --> 01:23:51,046
Look!

716
01:24:58,573 --> 01:25:00,490
Now we can move forward...

717
01:25:01,701 --> 01:25:05,495
to live once for real...

718
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:12,252
and then give way to people
who might do it better.

719
01:25:19,469 --> 01:25:21,553
Hey, Katherine.

720
01:25:24,974 --> 01:25:26,683
Will I see you again?

721
01:25:37,528 --> 01:25:39,196
To live only once...

722
01:25:44,577 --> 01:25:46,453
but with hope.

723
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:45,268
