3
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,610
2011年，病毒引發的瘟疫
滅絕了世界人口的99%

4
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:10,652
科學家特雷弗·古德查德
發明了祛病良策

5
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:15,622
五百萬人口得以倖存在
地球的最後之都——布瑞格拉

6
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:19,718
古德查德王朝統治400年後

7
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:25,229
部分反叛者出現並發起了
對古德查德政權的挑戰

8
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:50,929
片名：魔力女戰士

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,960
2415年

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,960
有人說布瑞格拉是個完美的社會
Some call Bregna the perfect society,

11
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:11,365
也有人說人類文明在這裡
發展到了極致
Some call it
the height of human civilization,

12
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:16,008
但其他人對此知曉更深
But others know better,

13
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:22,078
古德查德建立起布瑞格拉
讓我們對未來充滿信心
The Goodchilds built Bregna
to ensure us a future,

14
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:28,051
他們建造了"空中遺跡"作為紀念
They built the Relical...

15
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:31,450
以提醒我們是如何倖存下來的
a memorial to remind us
of what we've survived,

16
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:37,061
他們還修建起圍牆保護城市
They built walls to protect us,

17
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:43,862
並告訴我們
自然的暴虐已重臨外面的世界
They tell us that outside,
nature has retaken the world,

18
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,511
但真正的問題存在於城內
But the real problems lie within,

19
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,380
我們經常為不可名狀的悲傷所困擾
We are haunted
by sorrows we cannot name,

20
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,018
人口不斷失蹤
People disappear,,,

21
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:06,420
而政府卻無視這些罪行
and our government
denies these crimes,

22
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:11,690
古德查德政府所做的
只是讓我們維持貌似平靜的現狀
The Goodchild regime provides for us,
as long as we stay quiet,

23
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:17,096
於是我們用自由交換來的
卻是一個金絲鳥籠
So we trade freedom for a gilded cage,

24
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,909
但有些反叛者拒絕這種交換
But there are rebels
who refuse to make that trade,,,

25
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:26,245
他們奮起反擊
企圖推翻讓我們沉默的政府
who fight to overthrow a government
that silences us,,,

26
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:30,919
他們以失蹤人群的名義而戰
who fight
in the name of the disappeared,

27
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:38,153
他們自稱"魔力黨"
They call themselves the Monicans,

28
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,191
我是他們當中的一員
I am one of them,

29
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,263
先知
Handler.

30
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,895
伊恩
Aeon.

31
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,097
我們有個任務
We have an assignment.

32
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:03,437
準備派你去破壞古德查德的
中央監控系統
We want you to sabotage Goodchild's
central surveillance facility.

33
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:08,812
你進入後將被發覺，但我們
會暫時干擾他們的內部警報
Your entry will be noticed, but we will
briefly disrupt their interior alarms.

34
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:12,684
監控系統是他們對付我們的最強工具
Surveillance is their greatest tool
against us.

35
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:16,487
魔力黨人一被發覺
就會成為受攻擊的靶子
As long as Monicans can be seen,
we can be targeted,

36
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:19,584
我們需要你去蒙蔽他們的耳目
We need you to blind them.

37
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:26,027
每個任務的完成都使我們在摧毀
古德查德政權的道路上前進一步
Each mission brings us closer
to defeating the Goodchild regime,

38
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:34,502
這是我的女兒，你見過她嗎?
This is my daughter.
Have you seen her?

39
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,578
她兩個月之前失蹤了
She disappeared two months ago.

40
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,177
求你幫幫我吧，小姐
你見過這個女孩嗎?
Help me, please, miss.
Have you seen this girl?

41
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,384
她兩個月之前失蹤了
She disappeared two months ago.

42
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:45,249
失眠? 做惡夢?
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

43
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,686
來我們的睡眠治療中心尋求幫助吧
Visit our sleep center for help,

44
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:52,526
失眠? 做惡夢?
來我們的睡眠治療中心...
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?
Visit our sleep,,,,

45
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,391
你買菜是要招待我嗎，烏娜?
Shopping for me, Una?

46
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,758
沒聽說嗎? 這可是個特別場合
Haven't you heard?
It's a special occasion.

47
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,495
我姐姐終於肯來共進晚餐了
My sister's finally coming to dinner.

48
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,531
克勞迪斯和我都對今晚充滿期待
Claudius and I
are looking forward to tonight.

49
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,767
總算有一次能讓你在屋子裡
消停一會兒了
For once, you'll be in the house
long enough to sit down.

50
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:09,310
所以我才想要和你在這裡見面
That's why
I wanted to meet with you here.

51
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:11,571
伊恩
Aeon.

52
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:13,876
今晚我恐怕來不了，對不起
I may not make it tonight, I'm sorry.

53
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,150
別難過
Don't be upset.

54
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,551
你不能來赴宴不要緊
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

55
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,716
關鍵是為什麼
It's why.

56
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:24,224
知道麼，我過去常想
讓你和我一起奮戰
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

57
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,921
我們解決問題的方式不同
We have different ways
of solving problems.

58
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,520
對，你是視而不見
Yes. You ignore them.

59
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,065
我怎麼可能視而不見呢?
How could I possibly ignore them?

60
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,566
打擾一下，這是我的女兒
Excuse me. This is my daughter.

61
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,207
我知道問題所在，我感受得到
I see the problems. I feel them.

62
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,469
我努力從中看到好的一面
And I'm trying
to make something good out of it.

63
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,642
- 生命之美
- 怎樣的生命?
- A life.
- What kind of life is it?

64
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:53,384
這裡有很多好的人，好的事物
There are good things here.

65
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:57,986
這兒就有一個
There's one.

66
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,891
- 我還有個驚喜給你
- 告訴我
- So I have a surprise for you.
- Tell me.

67
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,463
今晚吧
Tonight.

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,507
小心行事
So be careful.

69
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:15,243
然後回家
And come back.

70
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:19,510
失眠? 做惡夢?
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

71
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:21,776
來我們的睡眠治療中心尋求幫助吧
Visit our sleep center for help,

72
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,548
失眠? 做惡夢?

73
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,486

74
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:46,633
有魔力黨同謀活動可疑跡象
3名受試者...
Possible Monican consort,
Three subjects,

75
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:49,862
要求身份確認
Identification requested,

76
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:53,404
發現魔力黨人活動可疑跡象
Possible Monican activity suspected,

77
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:04,045
你不能來赴宴不要緊
It's not that you can't come to dinner,

78
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:05,142
關鍵是為什麼
It's why,

79
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:09,186
知道麼，我過去常想
讓你和我一起奮戰
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me,

80
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,798
我們解決問題的方式不同
I think we have different ways
of solving problems,

81
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,734
芸芸眾生中，我努力...
This is the way things are
and I'm trying,,,

82
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:22,599
從中看到好的一面
生命之美
to make something good out of it, A life,

83
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,790
你來早了，克勞迪斯
You're early, Claudius.

84
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,005
但他們無處不在
But they're everywhere.

85
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:35,368
我們得保護你免受傷害
We need to protect you from them.

86
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:01,197
這就是古德查德主席
對付魔力黨人的手段
This is how Chairman Goodchild
deals with Monicans.

87
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,770
但她不是...
But she wasrt...

88
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,469
她不是魔力黨人
She wasrt a Monican.

89
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:22,752
我的家庭變成了過去式
I had a family once,

90
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,196
我的妹妹也是如此
I had a life,

91
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:35,564
現在我所能做的
只有完成我的使命
Now all I have is a mission,

92
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:47,740
烏娜
Una,

93
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:51,086
伊恩
Aeon,

94
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,551
伊恩，烏娜
Aeon, Una,

95
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:54,918
伊恩
Aeon,

96
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,452
回家
Come back,

97
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,695
收到
Yes.

98
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,236
她現在要見你
She will see you now,

99
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,616
先知
Handler.

100
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,251
伊恩
Aeon.

101
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,284
我們有個任務
We have an assignment.

102
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,720
一個你期待已久的任務
One you've been waiting for.

103
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,092
古德查德
Goodchild.

104
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:13,458
我們截獲了情報
並得以滲透他的保安系統
We've intercepted information that
will allow us to penetrate his security.

105
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:17,238
準備派你去消滅他
We want you to eliminate him.

106
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,865
您本該早些派我去的
You should've sent me in earlier.

107
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:22,804
- 那將無異於自殺
- 這猜測不適用於我
- That would've been suicide.
- Not for me.

108
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,208
耐心點，伊恩
Patience, Aeon.

109
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:27,111
我們花了一年時間
才獲得所需要的情報
It has taken a year
to get the information we need.

110
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,409
我知道你想要為烏娜復仇
I know you want to do this for Una.

111
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:33,048
但你必須牢記
使命的重要性遠大於個人動機
But you must remember,
this is larger than you.

112
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,024
她並非唯一一個無辜的受害者
She's not the only innocent person
who's been killed.

113
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,756
我們的時機來了
This is our moment.

114
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,261
我們從未如此強大過
We have never been stronger.

115
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,992
人民或許會感到恐慌
People are frightened, yes...

116
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:49,161
但如果向他們指明道路
but if we show them the way...

117
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,637
人民會在他(古德查德)死後
投靠到我們一方
they will rise behind us when he's gone.

118
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:53,538
我準備好了
I'm ready.

119
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,582
明天，古德查德將準備
對參議會的演講
Tomorrow, Goodchild will be preparing
his address to the Council.

120
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:14,292
要到達政府所在地
必須經過邊境處的花園
To reach the government zone, you
will need to cross the frontier garden.

121
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,662
穿過花園後，迅速直插敵方大本營
Once you are through the garden,
you must move quickly to the Citadel.

122
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:22,936
隱秘的敵方內部修建的仿若迷宮
The underground interior has been built
to be confusing.

123
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:26,667
我們將通關秘道植入你的體內
沿著它走
We've implanted a route for you.
Follow it.

124
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,706
我想要西珊卓和我一同穿越花園
I want Sithandra with me
for the crossing.

125
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:32,372
當然可以，快去論壇吧
Of course. Get to the Forum.

126
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,847
古德查德主席會在那裡的
That's where
Chairman Goodchild will be.

127
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:37,485
到時候你會知道該如何下手的
You know what to do from there.

128
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:38,810
是的
Yes.

129
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:43,116
完成這一使命既能讓你復仇
Do this and you will have your revenge.

130
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,684
我們也將一同迎接勝利
And we will all have our victory.

131
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:04,804
你好，西珊卓
Hello, Sithandra.

132
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:10,679
- 還是不能嚇到你
- 還不能啊
- Still can't surprise you.
- Not yet.

133
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:16,552
改裝的怎麼樣了?
How are the modifications?

134
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:27,595
很實用吧
Useful.

135
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:29,864
你本該也改造一下
You should have it done.

136
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:31,502
我還是喜歡穿鞋
I like my shoes.

137
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:40,543
警告，已接近居民區邊界
請停止前進
Warning, End of civilian zone,
Do not proceed,

138
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,523
警告，停止前進
Warning, Do not proceed,

139
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,751
準備好了嗎?
Ready?

140
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,918
時刻準備著
Always.

141
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:55,223
警告，停止前進
Warning, Do not proceed,

142
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:08,529
- 西珊卓
- 繼續行動
- Sithandra.
- Let's keep moving.

143
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:12,365
- 現在領教的如何?
- 很徹底
- We understand these now?
- Completely.

144
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,763
要避開這些草
I'd keep off the grass.

145
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,442
- 在1620見
- 我等你
- Rendezvous at 1620.
- I'll be waiting.

146
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,637
我贊同靶向攻擊
身份已證實的魔力黨人的政策
I agree with the policy
of targeting proven Monican threats.

147
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,173
但我恐怕我們會做的太過火
But I'm afraid we're going too far.

148
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:31,472
對付他們
怎麼做都不算過火
We can't go too far with them.

149
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:38,216
顯示出一定程度的寬宏大量
還是有好處的
There are advantages
to showing a degree of leniency.

150
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,881
我們不能再讓他們心存幻想了
他們當中任何人都別想
We can't allow them the luxury of hope.
Not even one of them.

151
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:44,287
殘暴的武力並非唯一選擇
Brute force isn't the only option.

152
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,858
可這行之有效
It's an effective one.

153
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,623
魔力黨越來越強大了
很快，武力攻擊將難以奏效
The Monicans are growing strong.
Soon, force won't be enough.

154
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,198
那你想要妥協嗎？還是談判?
So you want to compromise?
Negotiate?

155
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,725
這項政策應當重新考慮
The policy should be reconsidered.

156
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:57,772
- 投票決定吧
- 政策是不容爭辯的!
- Put to a vote.
- The policy is not up for debate!

157
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,567
我要爭辯!
I'm debating it!

158
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:07,280
我希望你能更超然的
看待這一問題，吉琥
I'd encourage you to look at this
with a little more detachment, Giroux.

159
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,443
不要摻加個人情緒
Here, we must be impersonal.

160
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:15,746
你們都不想要我太把你們
個人的情感宣洩當回事，對吧?
You wouldn't want me to take
your outburst personally, would you?

161
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,808
就這樣吧
That is all.

162
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:39,907
奧倫?
Oren?

163
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,718
我越來越擔心你了，奧倫
你太走極端
I'm getting worried about you, Oren.
This edge you've taken.

164
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,658
這麼做對我們沒什麼好處
Displays like that aren't helpful to us.

165
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:56,856
我堅決要保護我們所創造的世界
我不會為此道歉的
I believe in protecting what we've
created. I won't apologize for that.

166
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,433
創造它是為了容許我
完成我的工作
This was created
to allow me to do my work.

167
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:02,737
如果你不能控制自己
那我將無法完成
I can't do that
if you can't control yourself.

168
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,037
- 我能理解
- 真的嗎?
- Understood.
- Is it?

169
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:08,209
是的
Yes.

170
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:13,676
- 試驗結果如何?
- 全盤失敗
- And what about the test results?
- All negative.

171
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:17,876
抱歉
Sorry.

172
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:20,287
今上午再給我
組建一個新的實驗團隊
Find me a new test group by morning.

173
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,019
也許是時候放棄試驗了，特雷弗
Maybe it's time
to give up on the tests, Trevor.

174
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,818
現有的解決方案已能讓我們生存
它是完美的
We're living the solution already.
This is perfection.

175
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:31,228
- 為什麼你不能適可而止呢?
- 你注意到人們的行為舉止了吧
- Why can't you just embrace it?
- You see what's happening to people.

176
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,062
你知道這多麼讓人絕望
You know
how desperate this has become.

177
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,728
可它能被包容，被控制
It can be contained. Controlled.

178
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:39,604
我認為你已經忘卻了
所有這些都是暫時性的
I think you're forgetting
that this was all meant to be temporary.

179
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,509
我們總是那麼說，可為什麼呢?
We've always said that,
but why should it be?

180
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:43,976
因為那是錯誤的
Because it's wrong.

181
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:45,906
時代變了
Things change.

182
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,412
但我知道你不會的
But I know you won't.

183
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:50,644
你瞭解我的
You know me.

184
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,177
我們可是幾百年的兄弟了
I've been your brother a long time.

185
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:54,988
這你倒是說得對
You're right about that.

186
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,819
特雷弗, 該去演講了
Trevor, your speech.

187
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:00,455
特雷弗
Trevor...

188
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:20,708
沒用了
Useless.

189
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:39,065
- 確定目的地
- 論壇
- State destination,
- Forum.

190
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,060
徑直向前
Proceed forward,

191
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,472
轉向左
Proceed left,

192
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:53,444
我知道你們心懷恐懼
I know you have fears,

193
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:57,715
充滿悲傷，這動搖了你們的信念
磨煉你們的耐心
You have sorrows that shake your belief
and try your patience,

194
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:01,046
但是現在非同以往
我們必須團結在一起
But now more than ever,
we must stand together,,,

195
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:03,283
因為我們中間有股力量
because there are those among us,,,

196
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:05,951
妄圖摧毀我們所創造的一切
who would tear down
what we have built,

197
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:08,693
魔力黨人試圖分裂我們
The Monicans seek to divide us,

198
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:11,093
我們決不能忘記我們是誰
We must never forget who we are,,,

199
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:14,100
一個孤獨的部落，微不足道的組織
a lonely outpost, a tiny band,

200
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:18,396
我們是一度覆蓋地球表面的
人類倖存者
We're all that remains of a people
that once covered the Earth.

201
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:21,369
我們必須要適應新的挑戰
We must adapt together
to these new challenges.

202
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:26,713
記住我們曾經面對的
倖免於難的瘟疫
Remember what we have faced,
what we have survived.

203
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,083
我們會適應的
We will adapt.

204
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:34,855
我們總是能夠適應的
We have always adapted.

205
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:44,563
我們是一個有機的整體
It's the fabric of who we are.

206
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:56,041
凱瑟琳
Katherine.

207
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:11,586
是你啊
It's you.

208
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:31,108
凱瑟琳
Katherine,

209
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,997
等在外面
Wait outside.

210
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:37,269
伊恩
Aeon.

211
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:40,272
你早先叫我另外一個名字
You called me by another name earlier.

212
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:43,111
是的，而你放了我一條生路
I did, and you let me live.

213
00:25:43,284 --> 00:25:46,515
給我槍，我們再來試過
Give me my gun. We'll try it again.

214
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,447
下次再說吧
Maybe later.

215
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:51,787
那名字什麼意思?
What was that name?

216
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:55,660
你認識我，對嗎?
You know me, don't you?

217
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:57,653
不
No.

218
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,430
你知道自己是誰嗎?
Do you know who you are?

219
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:04,796
- 我只知道我要來殺你
- 所以你才會被關起來
- I know I came here to kill you.
- That's why you're in a cell.

220
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,505
但我們都為一個原因存活了下來
But we're both still alive for a reason.

221
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,917
雖然不知道那是什麼
I don't know what this is...

222
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,714
但見到你感覺真好
but it's good to see you.

223
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,759
業餘水平
Amateurs.

224
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:09,626
好小子
Good boys.

225
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:45,326
- 伊恩
- 現在有點忙，西珊卓
- Aeon,
- Little busy, Sithandra.

226
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,764
搞定了嗎?
Is it done?

227
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:50,195
我需要更多時間
I need more time.

228
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,436
我們收集的關於他的情報
也許是錯誤的
Our information on him may be wrong.

229
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,668
我不想知道，我們必須行動
希望你...
I don't understand this,
We have to move, I hope you...

230
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,972
別質疑我，西珊卓
Don't question me, Sithandra.

231
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,111
我一會兒再聯絡你
I'll contact you soon.

232
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:04,048
伊恩，你知道這麼做後果如何
Aeon, you know
there will be consequences to this,

233
00:29:04,252 --> 00:29:06,083
我知道我在做什麼
I know what I'm doing.

234
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:09,982
真讓人難以容忍
This is outrageous.

235
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:12,218
一個魔力黨人居然
避開了我們的全部設防?
One Monican
eluding all of our defenses?

236
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:13,726
這個問題會被解決的
The problem will be taken care of.

237
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:16,126
問題出在特雷弗的安全防範構想
The problem is
Trevor's concept of security.

238
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,289
他必須要學會接受更為傳統的...
He needs to learn to accept
more traditional...

239
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,663
要學會認可我們的投入
He needs to learn to accept our input.

240
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:23,871
還有，就是他總是按自己的議程
自行其是，不管我們怎麼想
Another example of him pursuing his
own agenda, no matter what we think.

241
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,805
- 我也開始懷疑他的議事日程了
- 什麼意思?
- I'm beginning to question his agenda.
- Meaning?

242
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:29,536
那個魔力女殺手想要幹掉他
而他卻放她一馬?
The Monican tries to kill him
and he lets her live?

243
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,077
這個決定非比尋常
An unusual choice.

244
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,146
而現在她逃走了
And now she's escaped.

245
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,908
有人相信這只是巧合嗎?
Does anyone believe
this is a coincidence?

246
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,847
你們真的以為我只是一個應聲蟲
Do you really think
that I'm a sympathetic ear...

247
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,010
只會聽你們對特雷弗發牢騷嗎?
for your complaints about Trevor?

248
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,986
我們無權懷疑他的所作所為
You don't have the right
to question what he does.

249
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,184
你得關注此事，奧倫
You must be concerned, Oren.

250
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,752
這可有違常規
This is hardly routine.

251
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,123
我認為我得和特雷弗談談
I think I should talk with Trevor.

252
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:54,130
而你們大家都應該
更加謹慎行事
And I think
all of you should be more discreet.

253
00:29:56,938 --> 00:29:58,064
伊娜瑞?
Inari?

254
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:04,202
圖像重建開始
Lmage retrieval commencing,

255
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,108
這是怎麼回事?
What happened?

256
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,905
我的原始數據對此沒有記錄
My sources were clear on this.

257
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,143
伊恩·弗拉科斯是魔力黨的頂尖殺手
Aeon Flux
is the best the Monicans have.

258
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:12,947
- 她失手了
- 這是她第一次失手
- She failed.
- It's the first time she has.

259
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:15,518
我想要做的乾淨利落
I wanted this done cleanly.

260
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,288
- 我的哥哥...
- 會比較容易受到傷害
- My brother...
- Will be vulnerable.

261
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:21,860
準備演講...
Preparing his speech...

262
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:24,022
明天，在1300坐標處...
Tomorrow, 1300...

263
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:28,595
無論如何都追查不到你
It can't be traced to you, in any case.

264
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:30,303
這還算令人寬慰
That's comforting.

265
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:32,395
我們每件事都做得順遂
We did everything correctly.

266
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:35,135
- 她有機會的
- 可她沒下手
- She had her opportunity.
- And she stopped.

267
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:36,736
為什麼?
Why?

268
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:41,740
- 我也不知道
- 圖像重建進行中
- I don't know.
- Image retrieval underway,

269
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,348
發起另一次襲擊太過冒險
lt'll be too risky to call another hit.

270
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:47,319
魔力黨人會懷疑自己受到利用
The Monicans may suspect
they are being used.

271
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,118
暫停
Stop.

272
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:55,487
奧倫?
Oren?

273
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:57,486
不
No.

274
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,061
那不可能
That's impossible.

275
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,374
克勞迪斯
Claudius.

276
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:21,121
- 你怎麼還在這裡?
- 不是你想的那麼簡單
- Why are you still here?
- It's not as simple as you think.

277
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:24,750
烏娜被殺害了
而你居然還在為兇手工作?
Una is murdered and you keep working
for the people who did it?

278
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:26,986
- 你說我會怎麼想?
- 你不明白的
- What should I be thinking?
- You don't know.

279
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,892
我怎麼不明白?
What don't I know?

280
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,054
他們殺害了她
They killed her.

281
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:34,294
- 而你依然苟且偷生
- 是你害了她，伊恩
- And you're still alive.
- You killed her, Aeon.

282
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:37,569
他們認為她是魔力黨人
所以她才會遇害
They thought she was a Monican,
that's why she died.

283
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:42,139
- 烏娜的生命本不至如此
- 她是我的全部
- Una's life was won'th more than that.
- She was all I had.

284
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:45,806
不是只有你這麼想
You're not the only one.

285
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:51,412
你究竟在這裡做什麼，克勞迪斯?
What are you
really doing here, Claudius?

286
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,614
工作
Working.

287
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,684
剩下的只有工作了
It's all that's left.

288
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,157
工作，為了特雷弗·古德查德
Working. For Trevor Goodchild.

289
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:02,322
我也詛咒他
I blamed him, too.

290
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,694
可是現在，我覺得不是特雷弗的錯
But now
I don't think it was Trevor's fault.

291
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,562
特雷弗在努力嘗試
Trevor's trying to help.

292
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:10,626
我們都不太對勁，伊恩
所有人都是
Something is wrong with us, Aeon.
With everybody.

293
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,103
你也做夢的，對吧?
You have the dreams, don't you?

294
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,037
回想起一些從不屬於你的事情?
Memories of things
that never happened to you?

295
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,409
烏娜是這樣，我也是
Una had them. I have them.

296
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:21,573
布瑞格拉全城都是這樣
It's happening all across Bregna.

297
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:23,741
- 這是怎麼回事?
- 我也不知道
- What is it?
- I don't know.

298
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,453
他們只告訴我們需要知道的
They only tell us what we need to know.

299
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:29,182
我的工作僅僅是一個更大實驗的
微小組成部分
My work is a small part
of a larger experiment.

300
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,724
- 誰的實驗?
- 特雷弗的
- Whose experiment?
- Trevor's.

301
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:35,519
我們正在研究圍城外部世界的事物
We're studying
what's growing outside the wall.

302
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:39,433
我們治癒工業瘟疫的同時
又催生了新的事物
Something happened
when they cured the industrial disease.

303
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:42,128
其他隱患又產生了
Something else sprung up in its place.

304
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,201
我們都出現了病態
We're sick.

305
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:48,302
特雷弗試圖治癒我們
我就知道這些
And Trevor's trying to cure us.
That's all I know.

306
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,707
特雷弗想要給我下藥
Trevor tried to dope me.

307
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:56,641
告訴我這是什麼
Tell me what's in this.

308
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,581
是條信息
It's a message.

309
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:07,651
哦，那它說什麼?
Well, what does it say?

310
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:11,060
你必須先喝下去
然後它才會起效
You have to drink it.
That's how it works.

311
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,734
我愛她
I loved her.

312
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:21,608
你知道的
You know that.

313
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:42,820
伊恩
Aeon,

314
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:48,295
我很抱歉這引起的不適
但公開場合講話不太安全
I'm sorry for the pain,
but it's not safe to talk in the open,

315
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:51,464
凡事往往表裡不一
Nothing is as it seems,

316
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:56,741
既然你有機會，為什麼要猶豫?
You had your chance,
Why did you hesitate?

317
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:02,476
你知道該去哪裡找我
You know where to find me,

318
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:34,939
- 為什麼我會來這裡?
- 因為我想要再見到你
- Why am I here?
- I needed to see you again.

319
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:37,479
你殺害了我妹妹
You killed my sister.

320
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,053
我對此一無所知
I didn't know anything about it.

321
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:42,082
對不起
I'm sorry.

322
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,383
- 這就是你的托辭?
- 不是
- And that excuses you?
- No.

323
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,423
可這是戰爭，各方都有死傷
But this is a war.
People on all sides die.

324
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:51,127
但她不應該，她與此毫無瓜葛
She shouldn't have.
She had nothing to do with this.

325
00:34:52,033 --> 00:34:55,332
- 人人都牽連其中
- 可是她沒有
- Everyone is involved in this.
- She wasrt.

326
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,440
我殺你用不著這個
I don't need that to kill you.

327
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,940
但這樣會容易些，對嗎?
But it would be easier, wouldn't it?

328
00:35:07,915 --> 00:35:10,315
自從我遇見你以後，一切都變了樣
Everything changed when I saw you.

329
00:35:12,553 --> 00:35:14,680
我認識你，正如你認識我一樣
I know you. And you know me.

330
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:19,949
為什麼我認識你? 為什麼?
Why do I know you? Why?

331
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,628
為什麼你要回來?
Why did you come back?

332
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,533
- 你想要從我這裡得到什麼?
- 我想要什麼?
- What do you want from me?
- What do I want?

333
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,667
我想要我妹妹復生
I want my sister back.

334
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:34,136
我想要記起作為一個人的感受
I want to remember
what it feels like to be a person.

335
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:42,973
伊恩
Aeon.

336
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:46,017
為什麼在你身邊會有這種感覺?
Why do I feel this way around you?

337
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:48,645
凱瑟琳
Katherine,,,,

338
00:36:50,384 --> 00:36:51,510
你認識我
You know me.

339
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:54,483
我想派你去消滅他
I want you to eliminate him,

340
00:36:55,956 --> 00:36:57,014
回家吧
Come back.

341
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:00,658
我不是你想像中那樣，伊恩
I'm not who you think I am, Aeon,

342
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:02,269
這兒似乎少了點什麼
Something is missing here,

343
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,546
我們鑒定出了
危及7A試驗組安全的變異體
We identified the variables
that compromised test group 7 A,

344
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,741
查清空中遺跡對7B組的隨訪時刻表
確保我們能夠隔離他們
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them,

345
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:12,250
這只是時間問題
It's just a matter of time,,,

346
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:15,550
事情解決前，人們會察探並質疑
所發生的失蹤事件
before people look up
and question what's happening here,

347
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,016
找到你了
Found you.

348
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:54,172
不會留下後遺症的，主席
No permanent damage here, Chairman.

349
00:42:58,051 --> 00:42:59,518
你們可以走了
You may leave.

350
00:43:03,657 --> 00:43:05,124
她逃走了
She's escaped.

351
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:07,490
我怎麼一點也不覺得驚訝?
Why am I not surprised?

352
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,528
我在圖書館找到了她
I found her in the library.

353
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,224
- 我覺得打傷了她，可是...
- 你攻擊她了?
- I think I wounded her, but...
- You attacked her?

354
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:14,766
她可是企圖行刺您的魔力女殺手
She's a Monican agent
who tried to kill you.

355
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,859
我認為我顯然應該攻擊她
I assumed it was obvious
what I should do.

356
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,768
弗雷娜，我想留她個活口
你明白嗎?
Freya, I want her alive.
Do you understand?

357
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:27,110
奧倫知道這事嗎?
Is Oren aware of this?

358
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:29,273
我找不到他
I can't find him.

359
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,381
跟住他
Stay close.

360
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:41,591
不管特雷弗過去為我們做過什麼
簡單責怪兩句是不夠的
No matter what Trevor's done for us
in the past, he's not above reproach.

361
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,253
這可是叛變
This is treason.

362
00:43:45,132 --> 00:43:46,190
奧倫?
Oren?

363
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:52,101
很久以來
特雷弗一直離我們漸行漸遠
Trevor has been moving away from us
for a long time.

364
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:55,439
我們創建最後之都的意義
超越於他之上
What we've built here
is larger than him.

365
00:43:58,645 --> 00:44:02,843
我從未想到會有這一天
但我們必須面對現實
I never thought it would come to this,
but we have to face the truth.

366
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:07,484
既然他選擇投靠魔力黨
他就一定知道那意味著什麼
He chose that Monican
and he knew what that would mean.

367
00:44:07,588 --> 00:44:09,249
必須除掉他
He must be removed.

368
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,415
那(魔力黨的)下個目標就是奧倫了
And Oren is next in line.

369
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:14,885
對不對?
Isn't that right?

370
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,722
對
Yes.

371
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:20,456
那現在宣判吧
It's done, then.

372
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:23,702
主席先生
Mr. Chairman.

373
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,735
特雷弗背叛了我們所有人
Trevor has betrayed all of us.

374
00:44:31,278 --> 00:44:32,836
他有罪
He's a criminal.

375
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:35,879
我們要像罪人那樣對他
We'll treat him as one.

我不再遵從命令指揮了
I'm not following orders anymore.

392

你為什麼要這樣做，伊恩?
Why are you doing this, Aeon?

393
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:44,108
事情變得更加複雜化
Everything has become
more complicated.

394

不，非常簡單
No, it's simple.

00:45:45,419 --> 00:45:47,512
特雷弗或許真的與烏娜之死無關
Trevor may not be responsible
for Una's death.

396
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:50,954
- 特雷弗?
- 我打算搞清楚他究竟是誰
- Trevor?
- I'm trying to find out who is.

397
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:55,928
你的任務是刺殺古德查德
既然你不能也不願做到的話，那麼...
Your mission was to kill Goodchild
and you can't or won't do that. So...

398
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:02,101
把武器給我
穿越邊境，原路折返
Give me your weapon
and return across the frontier.

399
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:06,434
- 我沒教過你獨立思考嗎?
- 你教會了我更多別的東西
- Didrt I teach you to think for yourself?
- You taught me a lot more than that.

400
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:09,736
拜託!
Please!

401
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,303
要是再逼我，我會傷著你的
I can hurt you if I have to.

402
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,910
你沒感覺到自己的異常嗎?
Don't you feel something wrong
inside you?

403
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:17,710
西珊卓，我...
Sithandra, I'm...

404
00:46:21,621 --> 00:46:23,452
我甚至不知道自己是誰
I don't know who I am.

405
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:28,620
你也這麼覺得，對嗎?
You feel it, too, don't you?

406
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:31,530
跟我走吧
Come with me.

407
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:35,066
我們會一起完成任務的
We'll finish the mission together.

408
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:42,135
我做不到
I can't.

409
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,110
有種過去玩的把戲很有意思
This sort of thing used to be fun.

410
00:48:02,022 --> 00:48:04,013
看看我要怎麼對付你吧
Now what do I do with you?

411
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:46,338
凱瑟琳
Katherine,

412
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:50,815

32.4.870
32,4,870,

424
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,337
收集完畢
Collected,

425
00:52:02,444 --> 00:52:05,743

426
00:52:06,282 --> 00:52:07,442
重複一遍
Repeat.

427
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:13,112
烏娜·弗拉科斯
成功完成再分配: 薩莎·普力羅
Una Flux, Reassigned as Sasha Prillo,

428
00:52:16,492 --> 00:52:18,824
薩莎·普力羅，地址

429
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:22,729
薩莎·普力羅，地址
Sasha Prillo, Address,

430
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:55,457
先知
Handler.

431
00:52:55,564 --> 00:52:56,861
西珊卓
Sithandra.

432
00:52:57,266 --> 00:52:59,257
古德查德還活著
Goodchild is still alive.

433
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:00,867
伊恩失敗了？
Aeon failed?

434
00:53:01,503 --> 00:53:03,095
她放過了他
She let him live.

435
00:53:03,906 --> 00:53:06,170
他們之間存在某種關係
There's something between them.

436
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:08,402
某種個人關係
Something personal.

437
00:53:08,877 --> 00:53:10,105
解釋一下
Explain.

438
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:12,274
她放棄了任務
She abandoned the mission.

439
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:15,976
我試圖阻止她，但受到她的攻擊
並把我留在這裡
I tried to stop her,
and she attacked me and left me here.

440
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:19,780
你那邊還安全嗎？
Are you secure where you are?

441
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,450
相當安全
Fairly.

442
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:25,082
後援馬上就到
Help is coming.

443
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:28,189
宣佈伊恩·弗拉科斯為逃犯
Aeon Flux is now considered a fugitive,

444
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:32,659
她背叛了抵抗組織，必須視作威脅
She has betrayed the resistance
and must be considered a threat,

445
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:36,329
她已經和古德查德聯手
現在正與他在一起
She has aligned herself with Goodchild
and is with him now,

446
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:38,201
我們必須趕快行動
We must move quickly,

447
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:41,306
將其消滅
You will eliminate her.

448
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:44,606
先行除掉她，然後完成她的任務
Kill her and then complete her mission.

449
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:48,616
西珊卓，告訴他們你的位置
Sithandra, show them where you are.

450
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:57,089
你們看到了嗎？
Do you see?

451
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,191
- 是的
- 是的
- Yes.
- Yes.

452
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:01,353
是的
Yes.

453
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,958
解救她，接著馬上行動
Extricate her and proceed from there.

454
00:54:13,108 --> 00:54:14,268
特雷弗?
Trevor?

455
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,818
是她嗎?
It's her.

456
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:30,549
是的
Yes.

457
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,793
- 她來過這裡
- 她來找什麼？
- She was here.
- What was she looking for?

458
00:54:35,497 --> 00:54:36,828
她妹妹
Her sister.

459
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:39,791
烏娜
Una.

460
00:54:55,184 --> 00:54:56,412
烏娜·弗拉科斯
Una Flux.

461
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,286
往下進行
Scroll down.

462
00:55:00,856 --> 00:55:03,984
7B試驗組成員
Member of test group 7B,

463
00:55:04,393 --> 00:55:06,122
顯示所有7B組信息
Show me all of 7B.

464
00:55:08,297 --> 00:55:09,992
山德琳·衛姆
Sandrin Veems,

465
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:12,762
7B試驗組成員

466
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,429
在警方行動中身亡
Killed in police action,

467
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,934
她在哪兒？
Where is she?

468
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:21,407
格麗塔·沙爾克
Greta Salk,

469
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,378
7B試驗組成員
Member of 7B,

470
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:26,804
在警方行動中身亡
Killed in police action,

471
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:28,778
這裡沒有其他人
There's nobody here.

472
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:31,846
卡米爾·阿勃第
Camille Abdi,

473
00:55:32,387 --> 00:55:34,651
7B試驗組成員
Member of 7B,

474
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,482
在警方行動中身亡
Killed in police action,

475
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:47,163
烏娜·弗拉科斯
Una Flux,

476
00:55:47,603 --> 00:55:49,798
7B試驗組成員
Member of 7B,

477
00:55:50,906 --> 00:55:53,067
在警方行動中身亡
Killed in police action,

478
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,922
誰做的這些?
Who did this?

479
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:13,552
所有行動均由
奧倫·古德查德副主席授權
All actions authorized
by Adjunct Chairman Oren Goodchild,

480
00:56:15,597 --> 00:56:19,124
弗雷娜，到我的實驗室
找出7B試驗組資料
Freya, go to my lab,
find the notes from group 7B.

481
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:22,067
你應該找個安全的地方躲藏
他們正在搜捕你
You need to get to a safe place.
They're moving against you.

482
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,604
- 2小時後在那裡等我
- 你要去哪裡？
- Meet me there in two hours.
- Where are you going?

483
00:56:24,706 --> 00:56:27,174
- 我必須在他們之前找到她
- 特雷弗
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor...

484
00:56:27,276 --> 00:56:29,540
弗雷娜，我們在實驗室見面
Freya, I'll see you at the lab,

485
00:56:30,379 --> 00:56:32,210
你自己小心點
Take care of yourself.

486
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,315
烏娜
Una.

487
00:56:43,492 --> 00:56:44,925
你是對的
You're right.

488
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,492
- 請不要傷害我的孩子
- 她沒事的
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- She's safe.

489
00:56:53,735 --> 00:56:55,259
你克隆了她?
You cloned her?

490
00:56:56,104 --> 00:56:57,833
我克隆了所有人
I cloned everybody.

491
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:04,042
在我們治療工業瘟疫時
產生了併發症
There was a complication
when we cured the industrial disease.

492
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:08,511
疫苗產生了意料之外的不良反應
The vaccine had
an unintended side effect,

493
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,849
不育症
Sterility.

494
00:57:12,654 --> 00:57:16,055
我們倖存者僅能生育一代
Only one more generation
of our species could survive.

495
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,549
那個時刻真是令人絕望
It was a desperate time,

496
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,025
全都是我們的責任...
It's our responsibility...

497
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:23,655
以往，克隆技術
從未成功應用於人類
Cloning had never been used
on humans successfully,

498
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,862
但我們成功了
But we succeeded.

499
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,233
現在，當一個人死後
其DNA會重複利用
Now, when a person dies,
their DNA is recycled.

500
00:57:36,378 --> 00:57:39,370
奧倫和我建造了空中遺跡
用來儲存DNA
Oren and I built the Relical
to store the DNA,,,

501
00:57:39,481 --> 00:57:41,449
並對克隆程序加以保密
and conceal the cloning process,

502
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,546
由保管人尋找條件適合的夫婦
The Keeper finds a suitable couple,,,

503
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:48,748
然後利用食品添加劑
導致藥物受孕
and, using food additives,
we induce a chemical pregnancy,

504
00:57:50,525 --> 00:57:54,484
當婦女來體檢時，再植入克隆胚胎
When the woman comes in for an exam,
we implant a cloned embryo,

505
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:57,023
從那時起，一切變得自然而然
From there, things happen naturally.

506
00:57:57,566 --> 00:58:01,366
9個月以後，死去的市民得以重生
In nine months,
a citizen who died is reborn,

507
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:07,208
已經繁衍了7代人
奧倫和我也克隆了我們自己
For seven generations,
Oren and I have cloned ourselves,,,

508
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:11,143
也教會我們自己
使我得以繼續探尋祛病之道...
taught ourselves, so that
I could keep trying to find a cure,,,

509
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,912
同時延續著生命
while we all live on,

510
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:21,550
我們就只是那樣嗎?
That's what we are?

511
00:58:22,758 --> 00:58:23,918
複製品?
Copies?

512
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,890
我們並不滿足於此
We're more than that.

513
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:33,400
那並非長久之計
It wasrt supposed to be permanent.

514
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:39,203
我試圖治療不育症
I've been trying to cure the infertility.

515
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:45,105
烏娜是我試驗組中的一員
Una was part of one of my test groups.

516
00:58:45,781 --> 00:58:47,339
奧倫對我撒了謊
Oren lied to me.

517
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,675
他告訴我她的試驗
像其他人一樣失敗了
He told me her test had failed
like the others.

518
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,513
但是她懷孕了
But she had become pregnant.

519
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:59,123
他殺害了所有受試者
He killed all of the subjects.

520
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,758
包括你妹妹
Your sister included.

521
00:59:04,433 --> 00:59:07,061
因為她懷了孕，所以要殺她
He killed her
because she was pregnant.

522
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,835
烏娜並不知道這些...
Una didn't know it...

523
00:59:14,443 --> 00:59:18,675
但她的孩子本該是400年來
第一個新出生的嬰兒
but her baby would've been one
of the first new children in 400 years.

524
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,339
是奧倫改變了這些
Orers changed.

525
00:59:23,919 --> 00:59:27,150
他不想回到過去
也不想有祛病之策
He doesn't want to go back.
He doesn't want a cure.

526
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,058
他想要永生
He wants to live forever.

527
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:43,159
既然你有膽幫助魔力黨人
一定也想過會這樣吧?
You must've been expecting this
after helping that Monican.

528
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:48,797
你對特雷弗的忠誠
再也保護不了你了
Your loyalty to Trevor
can't protect you anymore.

529
00:59:48,939 --> 00:59:51,965
我所忠誠的比這要深刻許多
I'm loyal to something deeper
than any of this.

530
00:59:52,976 --> 00:59:55,638
我搞不懂像你和特雷弗那樣的人
I don't understand
people like you and Trevor.

531
00:59:55,746 --> 01:00:01,564
你們的優柔寡斷
對陳年往事的念念不忘
Your sentimentality,
your devotion to the past...
to things that are gone.

532
01:00:01,652 --> 01:00:04,212
沒有那些我將無法生存
I couldn't live without those things.

533
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:06,320
你怎麼能...？
How can you?

534
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:25,667
薩莎
Sasha.

535
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:30,510
我們該走了
奧倫用不了多久就會找到我們的
We should go.
It won't take long for Oren to find us.

536
01:00:34,852 --> 01:00:36,820
她很快就會活蹦亂跳了
She's gonna be a handful.

537
01:00:40,757 --> 01:00:42,281
快走，他們要找的不是你們
Go. They don't want you.

538
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:43,416
快走!
Go!

539
01:03:41,471 --> 01:03:42,597
趴下!
Down!

540
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,319
不，你得保持清醒
No. You need to stay conscious.

541
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:12,194
請保持平靜
Please remain calm,

542
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,968
我們遇到了技術故障
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction,

543
01:04:18,742 --> 01:04:20,471
請保持平靜
Please remain calm,

544
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:24,246
我們遇到了技術故障
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction,

545
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,647
請保持平靜
Please remain calm,

546
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,219
我們遇到了...
We are experiencing,,,,

547
01:04:41,932 --> 01:04:44,423
我們不能去魔力黨藏身處
We can't go to a Monican safe house.

548
01:04:44,634 --> 01:04:46,898
對我們來說，沒有地方是安全的
Nowhere's going to be safe for us.

549
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,083
我們得把子彈取出來
We need to get the bullets out.

550
01:05:42,459 --> 01:05:44,450
還有其它地方受傷嗎？
Are you hit anywhere else?

551
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:52,157
他們當中有誰想要放過你嗎？
Did any of them manage to miss you?

552
01:06:11,655 --> 01:06:14,215
或許我們該去圍牆外面
We might have to go outside the wall.

553
01:06:15,459 --> 01:06:16,619
我知道
I know.

554
01:06:19,496 --> 01:06:21,487
首先，我必須終結這一切
First, I have to end this.

555
01:06:25,335 --> 01:06:27,132
我得回去一趟
I need to go back in.

556
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:30,305
我要拿回烏娜試驗組的資料
I have to get my notes
from Una's test group.

557
01:06:30,974 --> 01:06:35,274
奧倫會找到實驗室
破壞我所有的成果
Oren will find the lab and destroy it,
everything I've done.

558
01:06:51,027 --> 01:06:53,552
所有軍事單位向駐地匯報...
All military units should report
to their stations,,,

559
01:06:53,663 --> 01:06:55,756
並等待進一步指令
and wait for further instructions,

560
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:04,936
誰負責這裡？
Who's in charge here?

561
01:07:06,343 --> 01:07:07,708
我們需要你們的幫助
We need your help.

562
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:10,336
- 我們得到命令，見到你就開槍
- 這是政變
- We have orders to shoot you on sight.
- There's been a coup.

563
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:13,211
你們的命令來自於非法政府
Your orders are coming
from an illegitimate government.

564
01:07:13,316 --> 01:07:16,183
- 站住別動，長官!
- 你叫什麼名字?
- Stay where you are, sir!
- What's your name?

565
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:18,883
- 長官?
- 我想知道你的名字
- Sir?
- I want to know your name.

566
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:22,984
我叫奧德，加萊特·奧德
It's Ord. Garret Ord.

567
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:27,122
我再也不能命令你了，加萊特
但他們同樣不能
I can't command you anymore, Garret.
But neither can they.

568
01:07:27,697 --> 01:07:29,130
你是自由人了
You're free.

569
01:07:29,933 --> 01:07:32,060
你必須做出決定
You need to make a decision.

570
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:38,235
無論開槍還是幫助我們
請你快些決斷
Shoot us or help us, but do it quickly.

571
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:41,007
中尉？
Lieutenant?

572
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:52,046
該怎樣做才能幫到你
古德查德主席?
How can I help you,
Chairman Goodchild?

573
01:07:55,425 --> 01:07:58,189
我們需要武器，重返大本營
We need weapons.
We need to get back into the Citadel.

574
01:07:58,295 --> 01:07:59,523
是，長官
Yes, sir.

575
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:13,598
注意，請返回崗位
並等待進一步指令
Attention, Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions,

576
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,405
新指令將不斷下達
You will be updated frequently,

577
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:19,539
這是參議會和奧倫·古德查德主席
發佈的通告
This is an announcement from the
Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild,

578
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:25,815
注意，請返回崗位
並等待進一步指令
Attention, Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions,

579
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:31,919
- 我們接近目的地了
- 等一下
- We're getting closer.
- Wait.

580
01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:53,143
特雷弗
Trevor.

581
01:08:55,485 --> 01:08:57,476
你叫過我的名字...
The name you called me...

582
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,687
凱瑟琳
Katherine.

583
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,551
我以前叫這個名字
That was my name.

584
01:09:08,131 --> 01:09:09,723
你曾是我的妻子
You were my wife.

585
01:09:14,304 --> 01:09:17,330
我們以前一起生活
就像其他人一樣
We had a life together,
just like anybody else.

586
01:09:17,807 --> 01:09:18,865
等一下
Wait.

587
01:09:20,176 --> 01:09:21,905
你必須告訴我詳情
You need to tell me.

588
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,016
在瘟疫期間我失去了你
因為沒辦法治好你
I lost you during the disease,
and you couldn't be brought back.

589
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:31,679
從那之後我出生並死亡了7次
I've lived and died
seven times since then.

590
01:09:33,456 --> 01:09:36,118
每次我都告訴自己關於你的事
And each time
I taught myself about you,

591
01:09:36,926 --> 01:09:39,121
你是讓我活下去的信念所在
You were an idea I kept alive.

592
01:09:39,629 --> 01:09:41,688
有些事我只能靠自己想像
Something I had to imagine.

593
01:09:46,903 --> 01:09:48,666
但自從見到你
But when I saw you...

594
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:53,338
我所感覺的才變得真實
what I felt was real.

595
01:09:54,244 --> 01:09:55,609
我認識你的
I knew you.

596
01:09:57,447 --> 01:09:59,039
我想起你來了
I remembered you.

597
01:09:59,582 --> 01:10:03,518
存留在我們心中的感情
超越了死亡，超越了萬物
What we had then survived in us
past death, past everything.

598
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:07,620
我一直在找尋你
I was looking for you.

599
01:10:08,892 --> 01:10:10,519
而我一直在等待
I've been waiting.

600
01:10:12,162 --> 01:10:14,130
我們曾是其他人
We were different people,

601
01:10:14,964 --> 01:10:16,158
我們曾經是
We were,

602
01:10:16,966 --> 01:10:18,695
雖然那些人已經逝去
Those people are gone,

603
01:10:20,503 --> 01:10:22,801
但卻以另一種方式重生了
But something in them came back.

604
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:25,098
是的
Yes.

605
01:10:40,924 --> 01:10:42,255
我記起來了
I remember.

606
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:46,591
外面的局勢非常混亂
It's chaos out there.

607
01:10:46,696 --> 01:10:48,664
有一場針對古德查德的政變
There's a coup against Goodchild.

608
01:10:48,765 --> 01:10:50,756
潛入更容易了
Made it easier to slip in.

609
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:52,367
有辦法找到她嗎？
Did you bring a way to find her?

610
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:55,529
只要有她體內藥丸存留的痕跡
就能追蹤到她
As long as there's a trace of the pill
in her, we can track her.

611
01:11:05,982 --> 01:11:07,006
不
No.

612
01:11:25,902 --> 01:11:27,062
弗雷娜
Freya.

613
01:11:33,276 --> 01:11:34,573
完了
It's gone.

614
01:11:36,813 --> 01:11:38,337
我所找到的祛病之策
I had cured it.

615
01:11:38,581 --> 01:11:40,481
我所發現的訣竅
I'd found the answer.

616
01:11:40,984 --> 01:11:42,451
全部付諸東流
It's all gone.

617
01:11:45,455 --> 01:11:47,320
我們還要繼續行動
We have to keep moving.

618
01:11:56,299 --> 01:11:58,767
還有一件事要做
There's still one more thing to do.

619
01:11:59,302 --> 01:12:03,102
沒什麼事要做了，我們得離開這裡
There's nothing left to do.
You and I need to get out of here.

620
01:12:04,107 --> 01:12:07,338
到圍牆外面去
我們會找到生存之道的
We go outside the wall.
We'll find a way to live.

621
01:12:07,443 --> 01:12:10,970
還有一件事要做
我要毀了它
There's one more thing to do.
I need to destroy it.

622
01:12:11,781 --> 01:12:12,770
不
No.

623
01:12:15,385 --> 01:12:17,046
這不是解決辦法，伊恩
This isn't the answer, Aeon.

624
01:12:17,153 --> 01:12:19,519
我無法保證
能再找到祛病良策
There's no guarantee
I can find the cure again.

625
01:12:19,622 --> 01:12:22,614
- 克隆是我們僅有的
- 可這還不夠
- The cloning is all we have.
- It's not enough.

626
01:12:23,193 --> 01:12:26,856
我們的心智已逐漸打開
每一次克隆都使情況變得更糟
Our minds are unraveling, and every
time you bring us back it gets worse.

627
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:28,863
你這樣做意味著人類的終結
If you do this, we end.

628
01:12:29,365 --> 01:12:31,094
我們注定要死亡
We're meant to die.

629
01:12:32,669 --> 01:12:35,399
只有這樣，我們的存在才有意義
It's what makes
anything about us matter.

630
01:12:37,674 --> 01:12:39,733
這麼活著是一種煎熬
Living like this is torture.

631
01:12:39,843 --> 01:12:41,504
就像鬼魂一樣
We're just ghosts.

632
01:12:43,513 --> 01:12:45,140
我可沒有這樣的感覺
That's not how I feel.

633
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:48,509
至少現在沒有
Not now.

634
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:58,218
我們要多加小心
Let's be careful.

635
01:12:58,695 --> 01:13:00,925
大家要知道我們對抗的是誰
You know who we're up against.

636
01:13:07,337 --> 01:13:10,363
- 這樣做只是做做樣子罷了
- 但這是理念的飛躍
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

637
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:12,532
這不是由你決定的
It's not for you to decide.

638
01:13:13,509 --> 01:13:17,001
伊恩，我不想再失去你
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

639
01:13:18,448 --> 01:13:20,109
你不必如此
You don't have to.

640
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:23,410
你會再次發現解決之道的
You'll find the cure again.

641
01:13:24,787 --> 01:13:26,448
都結束了，特雷弗
It's over, Trevor.

642
01:13:34,163 --> 01:13:36,688
轉移到南部的塔尖
Moving into position on the south spire.

643
01:13:39,502 --> 01:13:42,096
已經有比你的治療
更有效的方法出現了
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

644
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:45,301
有些婦女已經自然受孕了...
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally...

645
01:13:45,408 --> 01:13:47,501
在你試驗之外
outside of your experiments.

646
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,541
越來越多的人懷孕了
More and more of them.

647
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,545
她們自發痊癒了
They healed themselves.

648
01:13:53,549 --> 01:13:56,450
- 你把她們也殺死了?
- 我必須阻止它
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

649
01:13:57,353 --> 01:13:58,650
有多少人?
How many?

650
01:14:03,092 --> 01:14:04,320
多少人，奧倫?
How many, Oren?

651
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:08,326
那無關緊要，自然之力
終於自尋出路了
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

652
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:13,397
- 到達指定位置
- 到達指定位置
- In position.
- In position.

653
01:14:13,503 --> 01:14:14,834
指定位置已到達
Position acquired,

654
01:14:15,204 --> 01:14:18,139
該被淘汰的是自然，而不是我們
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

655
01:14:19,409 --> 01:14:23,607
你為什麼還不明白
你所創造的美好奇跡? 我都明白
How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

656
01:14:24,948 --> 01:14:26,609
情況越發複雜了
Situatiors getting complicated.

657
01:14:33,423 --> 01:14:35,550
你告訴我她已經死了
You told me she was gone.

658
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,860
他們已經盡力而為了
There was nothing that they could do.

659
01:14:45,535 --> 01:14:47,662
我命令銷毀她的DNA
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

660
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:51,638
和她在一起
讓你變成了另一個人，特雷弗
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

661
01:14:51,741 --> 01:14:54,938
她會阻止你做你該做的事
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

662
01:14:56,045 --> 01:14:57,945
- 就像她現在在阻止你一樣
- 不，奧倫
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

663
01:14:58,047 --> 01:14:59,071
是的
Yes.

664
01:14:59,415 --> 01:15:01,280
- 請下指令
- 等我信號
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

665
01:15:01,384 --> 01:15:03,614
這個世界，我們的世界
已經很完美了
This world, our world, is beautiful.

666
01:15:04,253 --> 01:15:06,346
值得用任何代價來維護
Worth preserving at any cost.

667
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:08,889
這不會長久的
它已經在分崩離析了
It can't last. It's falling apart.

668
01:15:12,795 --> 01:15:14,695
西珊卓，給我們信號
Sithandra, give us the signal,

669
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:19,032
- 西珊卓
- 先放倒弗拉科斯
- Sithandra,
- Take Flux down first.

670
01:15:19,135 --> 01:15:20,227
你在這個問題上是錯的，奧倫
You're wrong in this, Oren.

671
01:15:20,336 --> 01:15:22,736
我們擊敗了死亡，擊敗了自然
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

672
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,601
我們已經凌駕於你的構想
We've gone beyond you.

673
01:15:26,275 --> 01:15:28,300
現在我要擺脫你的束縛
And now I need to be free of you.

674
01:15:38,554 --> 01:15:39,612
等一下
Wait.

675
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:53,966
西珊卓
Sithandra.

676
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:01,005
這是你自食其果
伊恩，太遲了
You chose this, Aeon. It's too late.

677
01:16:01,377 --> 01:16:03,402
你知道我們所經受的苦楚
You know how much we're all suffering.

678
01:16:03,513 --> 01:16:05,879
我正在努力終結它，特雷弗也是
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

679
01:16:06,516 --> 01:16:08,450
我永遠不會背叛你
I would never betray you.

680
01:16:09,052 --> 01:16:10,246
幫幫我
Help me.

681
01:16:12,422 --> 01:16:13,753
西珊卓
Sithandra,

682
01:16:14,924 --> 01:16:16,585
你還是瞭解我的
You still know me,

683
01:16:16,692 --> 01:16:18,023
幹掉她
Finish it.

684
01:16:18,928 --> 01:16:20,987
你可以選擇信任我
You can choose to trust me,

685
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:26,824
幹掉她
Finish it.

686
01:16:26,936 --> 01:16:28,528
對不起，奧倫
I'm sorry, Oren.

687
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:29,829
對不起
I'm sorry.

688
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:31,065
我也是
I am, too.

689
01:16:36,045 --> 01:16:39,242
更改命令，掩護伊恩
掩護古德查德
Orders have changed.
Cover Aeon. Cover Goodchild.

690
01:17:21,824 --> 01:17:23,121
古德查德被擊中了
Goodchild's been hit.

691
01:17:27,697 --> 01:17:29,358
弗拉科斯正在向庭院挺進
Flux is headed to the courtyard.

692
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:34,533
掩護伊恩
Cover Aeon.

693
01:18:58,354 --> 01:18:59,685
西珊卓!
Sithandra!

694
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,032
奧倫
Oren.

695
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:27,331
他們來了
They're coming.

696
01:20:32,515 --> 01:20:33,675
伊恩
Aeon.

697
01:20:53,736 --> 01:20:55,931
我們在等待您的命令
We're waiting for your orders.

698
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:58,373
你們沒份參與？
You're not part of this?

699
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,969
不論是否參與
我們都不是無政府主義者
Whatever we are, we're not anarchists.

700
01:21:02,378 --> 01:21:04,869
- 必須要有規則
- 謝謝
- There have to be rules.
- Thank you.

701
01:21:36,946 --> 01:21:38,470
你就是那個人
You're the one.

702
01:21:39,248 --> 01:21:40,681
是你救了我
You saved me.

703
01:21:41,283 --> 01:21:42,307
不錯
Yes.

704
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:45,077
我那時認識你
I knew you then,

705
01:21:45,454 --> 01:21:48,082
她的軀體已被侵蝕，毀掉她
This one was corrupted. Destroy it.

706
01:21:48,624 --> 01:21:50,615
我知道你很重要
I knew you were important.

707
01:21:51,293 --> 01:21:52,851
DNA是完好的
The DNA is good.

708
01:21:52,962 --> 01:21:54,293
毀掉她
Destroy it.

709
01:22:00,236 --> 01:22:02,761
我知道我該保護你
I knew that I needed to protect you,

710
01:22:04,573 --> 01:22:08,669
我將你的DNA儲存在休眠狀態
I kept your DNA hidden here, dormant.

711
01:22:09,311 --> 01:22:12,007
直到現在才讓你重生
I've waited until now to bring you back.

712
01:22:12,348 --> 01:22:13,372
為什麼？
Why?

713
01:22:13,682 --> 01:22:18,551
我知道你的力量會一併保存下來
I knew that your strength
would survive with you.

714
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:22,721
如果讓你重生，你就可以改變特雷弗
I thought that if I brought you back,
you could reach Trevor.

715
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,787
你一直擁有這種力量
You always could.

716
01:22:27,096 --> 01:22:30,031
- 我必須終結這一切
- 是的
- I have to end it.
- Yes.

717
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:32,395
從頭再來
Start over.

718
01:22:33,269 --> 01:22:34,793
那你怎麼辦？
What about you?

719
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:39,936
我等了400年，就是為了這天
I've waited 400 years for this day.

720
01:22:43,546 --> 01:22:44,843
我太累了
I'm tired.

721
01:22:52,354 --> 01:22:53,946
好好活下去，伊恩
Stay alive, Aeon.

722
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:57,649
人民需要你
You are needed.

723
01:23:49,879 --> 01:23:51,107
看哪!
Look!

724
01:24:58,681 --> 01:25:00,672
現在我們可以大步向前了
Now we can move forward,,,

725
01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:05,286
真實地活上一生一世
to live once for real,,,

726
01:25:07,256 --> 01:25:12,955
然後把世界留給那些
能將它變得更美好的後代們
and then give way to people
who might do it better,

727
01:25:19,668 --> 01:25:21,397
嘿，凱瑟琳
Hey, Katherine.

728
01:25:25,174 --> 01:25:26,971
我能再見到你嗎？
Will I see you again?

729
01:25:37,686 --> 01:25:39,415
儘管人生只有一次...
To live only once,,,

730
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:46,217
卻要活得充滿希望
but with hope,

731
01:25:50,217 --> 01:26:18,217
劇終  歡迎光臨
