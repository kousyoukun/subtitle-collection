I remember it being such an
important time in the Middle East.

00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:21,878
Did you like living there?

803
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:24,881
In Jordan?
Um, yeah, for the most part.

804
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:27,884
It was hard on my mom,
so my parents fought a lot.

805
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,852
My dad could be a real asshole.

Really? I'm sorry.

I'm sure he was
just doing his best.

808
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:37,159
I'm sure he thought so.

809

"nor repel them, but address
them in terms of honor."

813
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:52,440
Right.

Well, shall we?

815
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:14,562
Wow! Nice place you have here.

00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:16,198
Thanks.

Yes, uh, we can just set these
down right here.

I think I credit my mom
with my acting ambitions.

Your mom?

871
00:41:53,756 --> 00:41:55,324
Yeah. I...

skits to try and cheer her up.

873

She used to say I was the only
person who could make her smile,

874
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:08,337
and I loved that.

875
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:12,775
Even now,
I feel like I owe it to her,

876

like, if I stop,
she'll stop smiling or something.

Uh, plus she told me I was good at
it, so, I mean, I...

- What?
- Oh, nothing.

such a mystery.

Oh, come on!

We just met, but I think I can
tell there's a good reason

887
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:51,013
behind every choice you make.

888
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:55,885
I owe it all to my tata,
my grandmother.

889
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:57,219
Was she a doctor?

890

We were at the movies
sharing some popcorn,

and I looked over,
and she was blue.

this giant, hulk of a man,

just swooped in,
and dislodged the popcorn.

900
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,256
He saved her, and she never
stopped thanking God for him.

901
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:38,460
I wanted to do that,
to save people,
