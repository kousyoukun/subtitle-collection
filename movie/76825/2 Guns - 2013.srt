Oh, here I was hopin' for a free toaster.

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
银行为什么要送烤面包机
Why would a bank give out free toasters?

这位耐心的服务员  美琪
Our very patient waitress, Maggie,

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,480
都过来四次让我点餐了
well, at least it says Maggie on her name tag,

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,910
她名牌上写着美琪
has asked me to order four times.

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,590
你要是再不点餐也太没礼貌了
If I don't order at this point, it's just rude.

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,230
-我可以一会再来  -不  没事
-I can come back. -No, it's okay.

22
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,870

你是共产党吗

给我朋友来一份煎饼和煎鸡蛋
My friend'll have the pancakes and a fried egg.

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,390
我想吃蔬菜肉丁  不过要剁大的很碎才行  知道吗
I'm thinkin' hash, but only if it's like chunky style, okay?

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,670
喂  你要是给我点鸡蛋和煎饼  我肯定会踹死你
Listen, if you order me eggs and pancakes, I'm gonna kick your behind.

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
但是你总得吃早饭吧  这可是一天最重要的一餐
But you gotta eat breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day.

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,590
女士  忽略他吧  明白
Uh, ma'am, ignore everything he said, okay?

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,270
可别给我鸡蛋和煎饼
Don't bring me any eggs and pancakes.

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,440
给我杯咖啡就行了  多给他几个鸡蛋
Just bring me some coffee and bring him a couple eggs.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,590
我不要鸡蛋  我想吃蔬菜肉丁
I don't want eggs. I want hash.

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,680
在上面放点鸡蛋也行
You know what, put a couple eggs on it.

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,990
再给他来点黑麦面包
Give him some rye toast, too.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,590
我不要黑麦面包  我不喜欢黑麦面包
No rye toast for me. I don't like rye toast.

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,950
-来个煎饼  -不要煎饼
-And a pancake. -No pancakes.

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,710
来一点银元饼  有迷你的吗
Maybe a little silver-dollar one. You got the little baby ones?

39
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,920
不要煎饼  不要银元饼  也不要黑麦面包
No pancakes, no silver dollars, no rye toast.

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
我喜欢粗裸麦面包
I like pumpernickel.

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,830
我们也有粗裸麦烤面包

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,910
-嘿  美琪  等等  -好的
-Hey, Maggie, wait. One more thing. -Yeah.

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,230
那个送你  在我们重逢之前你就随身带着吧
That's for you. You take that with you till we see each other again

44
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,120
以免你太想我了  好吗
in case you miss me too much, okay?

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
-你干嘛这么做  -怎么了
-Why you gotta do that? -What?

46
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,750
你干嘛跟她抛媚眼
Wink at the waitresses like that?

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
-服务员都喜欢我  -没人喜欢你
-Waitresses like me. -Nobody likes you.

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,310
-所以呢  -所以
-So? -So.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,390
你查到什么了
What do ya got?

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,800
这是家安保不强的银行
So, it is a sleepy bank.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,630
-能动手  -说得对
-Doable? -That's correct.

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,880
我早说过吧
I told you.

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,050
很多油炸圈饼啊
That is a lot of doughnuts.

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,400
蔬菜肉丁一会就来  
I'll be right back with your hash.

55
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,560
美琪  你这火热的手工油炸圈饼  有什么名头吗
Maggie, your hot homemade doughnuts, they any good?

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,680
-周围三郡最好的  -我告诉你怎么做吧
-Best in three counties. -I'll tell you what you do.

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,870
我买三个圈饼
You bring us three of those bad boys.

58
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,350
帮我打好包  行吗
Put'em in a to-go box for us, all right?

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,690
-行  -谢谢
-All right. -Thank you.

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
好了  该走了
All right, time to make the move.

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,880
好吧  还指望她来勾引我呢
All right, there's gonna be some sirens in this bitch.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240

-Hey. Good morning, sir. How are you? -Morning.

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
嘿  美琪
Hey, Maggie.

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,150
很抱歉  我这个朋友
I'm very sorry about my friend.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,150
小时候脑袋被踢过
He was kicked in the head as a child.

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
-他没那么讨厌  -不  他就是
-He's really not that bad. -No, he is.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,240
怎么回事
What's goin' on?

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,150
大家马上离开这里
Okay, I'm just gonna have you all exit the building.

71
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,190
可能是假警报  但是为了安全起见
It might be a false alarm, but just do it safely.

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
谢谢  谢谢合作
Thank you. Thank you.

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,070
大家都出去了吗  麻烦你出去吧
Is everybody out? I'm gonna need you to step outside.

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,350
知道了  美琪  我拉我朋友一起出去
All right, Maggie, I'm just gonna grab my friend.

75
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,640
-好吧  -我们去付账
-Okay. -We gotta pay our bill.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,400
该走了
We should go.

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,030
这就是你给的小费
Is that all you're gonna leave for a tip?

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,550
15%呢  你只留了15%的小费
It's 15%. You leave 15%.

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,750
不  你起码该得30%
No, you gotta leave at least 30.

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,950
不行  15%是标准
No, you don't. 15% is standard.

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,270
我的美琪都要失业了  兄弟  别这么小气嘛
My Maggie's about to be out of a job, man. Don't be cheap.

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,880
好吧  这有五块  那有七块了
Okay, there's five. That's seven.

There you go. Come on.

84
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,560
好吧
All right.

85
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,310
干嘛  不是吧
What? No, you didn't.

86
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,810
-我就拿了  -真小气
-Yes, I did. -Oh, my God.

87
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,800
你觉得怎么样
How'd you say it?

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,550
从来没有从卖着最棒油炸圈饼的餐厅出来
Never rob a bank across from the diner

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,910
就去抢银行的吧
with the best doughnuts in three counties?

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,960
说得对
That's correct.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,900
{\an8}双龙出手

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,500
{\an8}一周前

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,500
{\an8}墨西哥  索诺拉

94
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,680
鲍比  帕皮在马厩里
Bobby. Papi's down in the stables.

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,840
你不如过去吃点东西吧
Why don't you get somethin' to eat?

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,030
我又不饿
I'm not hungry.

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,610
-你肯定饿了  -我要跟你去

Hey, listen. We're here to do business. Diplomatically.

99

我也可以正经啊
Well, I can be diplomatic.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,950
你也可以很饿  对吧
You can be hungry, too, right?

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,160
鲍比

102
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,850
-在这等着  -好的
-Wait here. -Okay.

103
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,070
有人坐这吗
Somebody sittin' here?

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,150
小托罗
Little Toro.

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,630
人一走开  座位就得丢  对吧
Oh, well, you move your feet, you lose your seat, right?

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,750
-脑袋也丢了  -说得对
-Lose your head, too. -That's correct.

107
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
那小托罗去哪了呢
So, where is Little Toro?

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,760
就是你放包的地方
Alllí, where you put him.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,720
-这里  -那里
-Aqui? -Allí.

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,810
玩多米诺吧
Let's play some dominoes.

111
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,440
-帕皮可以见你了  -好的
-Papi's ready. -Yeah.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,330
帕皮·格雷科
Papi Greco!

113
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
"很有门路"的鲍比
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,880
就是我
That's correct.

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,000
快点  鸵鸟  一罐乙醚简直能媲美63年的雪佛兰啊
Quick, an ostrich, a tank of ether, a '63 Impala convertible.

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,830
叫它64吧
Make it a '64.

117
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,670
我在我们那边
My side of the border.

118
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,950
我认识个行家
I know a guy.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,530
我说过的吧  他绝不会说不行  不说可能
What did I tell you? He never says no, never says maybe,

120
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,720
也不会说"等着瞧我的本事吧"
never says, "I'll see what I can do."

121
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
不错的牛啊
Nice bull.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,400
我希望它是头好种牛
I hope he's a good breeder.

123
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,200
说起小托罗真有点可惜了
That's a shame about Little Toro.

124
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,350
胡里奥发现他揩油
Julio caught him skimming.

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,520
噢
Oh.

126
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,320
听起来不像小托罗作风啊
That don't sound like Little Toro.

127
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
这是给我的吗  是的
Is that for me? That's correct.

128
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,550
每个人都会揩点油  这是人类天性
Everybody skims a little cream. It's human nature.

129
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,880
人类天性也不能放任
Just 'cause it's human don't mean you let it go.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
嗯
Hmm.

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,990
线条不错  颜色很好
Nice lines. Good color.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,030
是的
That's right.

133
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,690
确实是行家
He knows a guy.

134
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
你准备给我什么呢
What you got for me?

135
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,120
现金
Cash.

136
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,200
现金
Cash?

137
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,920
如果你要给我100,000的话
Supposed to be givin' me 100,000 to deal.

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
为什么不给我100,000的可卡因呢
Why didn't you give me $100,000 worth of cocaine?

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,110
可卡因在哪
Where's the cocaine?

140
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,560
我的买家想要可卡因
My buyer wants cocaine.

141
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,270
那就让他买呗
So let him buy cocaine.

142
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,070
他就是这么打算的  他想买可卡因
That's what he's tryin' to do. He's trying to buy cocaine.

143
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,630
我告诉他我认识卖家  所以我就来找你了
I told him I knew a guy, therefore I come to you.

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,560
你就是我认识的卖家  所以我才跟人说了
You the guy I know. That's why I told him.

145
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,110
那把护照拿回去吧
So take back the passports.

146
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,200
在小托罗之后  我们不再接待新的顾客了
After Little Toro, we're not takin' on any new customers.

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,670
别这么失礼嘛  我又不是新顾客
Well, no disrespect, but I ain't no new customer.

148
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,120
你跟我打交道很久了
You been dealin' with me for a long time.

149
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,600
你把护照留着吧
You keep the passports.

150
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,710
钱也留着
Keep the money, too.

151
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,750
什么时候你能给我货了  再给我
When you're ready to give me the product, give me the product.

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,880
算...
Till then...

153
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
你欠我的
You owe me.

154
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,110
这样可不算运动  兄弟们
It's not very sporting, man.

155
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,560
至少要给这些鸡反击的机会吧
At least give the chickens a chance to shoot back.

156
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,240
嘿  兄弟  我说如果让我杀只毫无还手之力的动物
Hey, man, I'm just sayin'. If I'm gonna kill a defenseless animal,

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,950
我会把它做成美味的烧烤以尊重它的牺牲
I'm gonna honor its sacrifice by grilling it into some tasty barbecue.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,750
我可不会折磨它
What I'm not gonna do is torture it

159
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,490
来证明我打不到离我小弟弟更远的东西
just to prove I can't hit anything further away than my own pecker.

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,170
-你手下可真能吠啊  -是啊
-Your cuate's a real junkyard dog. -Mmm.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
你们什么时候认识的

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,800
有一晚我给了他点甜头  他就给我回家了

163
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,630
嘿  长得帅的那个牛仔
Hey, cowboy. You, the pretty one.

164
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,840
你有没有听过"你长了张亲娘才会喜欢的脸"
You ever hear the expression, "You got a face only a mother can love"?

165
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,160
这话不适合你  你长得简直连亲娘都看不过眼
That don't apply to you. You are uglier than the devil's asshole itself.

166
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,320
斯蒂格
Stig!

167
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,800
你在干嘛
What are you doin'?

168
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,990
他们在折磨这些鸡  兄弟
They're torturing chickens, man.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,330
你在吃什么
What are you eatin'?

170
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,830
鸡腿
A chicken.

171
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,230
过来  这不一样  明白
Come here. It's not the same thing, okay?

172
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,790
看到桌边那个袋子吗
See that bag over there by the table?

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
土豆沙拉旁边的自助餐桌
Buffet table next to the potato salad.

174
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,030
看到了  保龄球袋  怎么了
Yeah, the bowling bag. What about it?

175
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,160
小托罗的头在那个袋子里
Little Tom's head is in that bag.

176
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,530
-不是吧  -是的
-Bullshit. -Yeah.

177
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,560
知道吗  这也太过分了  老兄
You know what? That's fucked up, man.

178
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,310
嘿  哇  哇  我们走吧  好吗  快点  走吧
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go. Okay? Come on, let's go.

179
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,640
说英语  你这个色鬼
Say it in English, you goat fuck.

180
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,590
来给我吹箫吧
Suck my chicken.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,990
你这么说还真奇怪  肥仔
That's funny comin' from you, fat boy.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
你从婴儿起就没见过你的小弟弟吧
You ain't seen your pecker since you were a baby.

183
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,190
不能因为你把手指放到肚脐上
Just 'cause you put your finger in your belly button

184
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
有便便流出来  你就觉得那是你的菊花了
and brown shit comes out don't mean it's your asshole.

185
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,800
-你说什么呢  -别担心  兄弟
-What did you say? -Don't worry about it, man.

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,320
把它们挖出来  做烧烤吧
Now dig 'em up and make some damn barbecue.

187
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
拜拜  娘炮
Bye, chica.

188
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,130
你刚刚跟他抛媚眼了
Did you just wink at him?

189
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,830
我是跟他抛媚眼了  他现在算我的小相好了
I did wink at him, 'cause he's my bitch now.

190
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
不是吧
Uh... oh!

191
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,440
-射得好  -谢谢夸奖
-That's good shootin'. -Gracias.

192
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,280
你该知道  小托罗死得不明不白  兄弟
You know, Little Toro never did nothin' to nobody, man.

193
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,090
我们应该去特雷司·克鲁塞斯储贷公司
We should rip off Papi's stash

194
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,080
把帕皮藏起来的钱偷走
at the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

195
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,070
帕皮的手下每两周就会把一个
You know, Papi's guy delivers a briefcase

196
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,910
装满钱的公文包送到特雷司·克鲁塞斯去
full of money to Tres Cruces every two weeks.

197
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
加起来至少也有300万了吧
That's gotta add up to, what, like three million at least.

198
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,200
如果帕皮知道我们在考虑抢劫特雷司·克鲁塞斯
If Papi knew we were even talkin' about rippin' off Tres Cruces,

199
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,200
土豆沙拉旁边的袋子里装的就是我们的脑袋了
it would be our heads in that bag next to the potato salad.

200
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,330
不可能  那袋子那么小装不下我们俩的脑袋
No way. Our two heads would never fit in a bag that small.

201
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,950
走吧  兄弟  去抢银行吧
Come on, man, let's hit the bank.

202
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,920
小托罗是你的朋友  也是我朋友
Little Toro was your friend. He was my friend.

203
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,800
-那又怎么样呢  -这是什么意思
-So? -What do you mean "so"?

204
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,040
如果是我呢  如果帕皮砍的是我的脑袋呢
What if it was me? What if it was my head Papi ran through the saw mill?

205
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,730
-你不会追杀他  -不会
-You wouldn't come after him? -Nope.

206
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,590
-不会杀了他  -不会
-You wouldn't kill him? -Nope.

207
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,290
该死的  他要是那么对你我会杀了他
Shit, man, he did that to you, I'd kill him.

208
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:28,920
你知道为什么吗
You know why I'd kill him?

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,550
因为我们是一伙的  而且我们有代号
Because you're my people and there's a code.

210
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,150
首先  根本没有代号
There is no code, first of all.

211
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,470
你总是随心所欲  不管付出什么代价
You do whatever you gotta do, whatever it takes.

212
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
其次呢
And second?

213
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,830
说得对  我们不是一伙的  你都没同伙
Right, we're not people 'cause you don't have people.

214
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,040
说对了
That's correct.

215
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,760
去墨西哥的目的是什么
Purpose for your visit to Mexico?

216
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,960
捕猎鹌鹑
Quail hunting.

217
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,810
我在图巴市的婶婶心脏病发了  所以我们缩短了行程
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart attack so we cut our trip short.

218
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,110
图巴市
Tuba City?

219
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
靠近奥德萨市
It's near Odessa.

220
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,710
好地方
Nice place?

221
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
烂地方  但她是我最喜欢的婶婶
Hellhole, but she's my favorite aunt.

222
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,560
-别动  举起手来  -该死
-Don't move. Let me see your hands. -Oh, shit.

223
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,410
-说说你的旅行吧  -我要见律师
-Tell us about your trip. -Lawyer.

224
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,670
-有什么不能说的  -我要见律师
-What's the big deal? -Lawyer.

225
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,640
你去了索诺拉  是不是
You were down in Sonora, weren't you?

226
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,460
你以为杰瑟普探员和禁药取缔机构
You don't think Agent Jessup and the DEA

227
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,760
会不认识你和帕皮·格雷科
know about you and Papi Greco?

228
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,110
律师呢  我要律师
Lawyer. Lawyer.

229
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,150
他们知道你去了他的牧场
They know you were at his ranch.

230
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,320
我只知道我要见律师
I know I need a lawyer.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
把帕皮·格雷科的事情跟里斯探员说说
Tell Agent Rees about Papi Greco.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,840
-谁  -帕皮·格雷科
-Who? -Papi Greco.

233
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,840
那是谁  墨西哥圣诞老人还是别的什么
Well, who's that? Some Mexican Santa Claus or something?

234
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,280
别装了  斯蒂格曼先生
Come on, Mr. Stigman.

235
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,320
我觉得跟我们合作对你最有利
I think it's in your best interest to cooperate.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
别再玩什么把戏了  行吗
You need to stop playin' the stupid card, all right?

237
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,790
长官  我是很乐意跟你们合作的
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to cooperate with whatever you need.

238
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,870
作为一个美国人  我知道你在履行职责
I mean, as an American, I know you're just doin' your job,

239
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,990
有时候也会错抓像我这样的无辜民众
and sometimes innocent folks like me get caught up in the system.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,510
就像航空公司  他们又不会故意弄丢你的行李  是吧
It's like the airlines. They don't lose your luggage on purpose, right?

241
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,390
但是大家都太自私了
But everybody takes it so damn personal.

242
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,150
够了  斯蒂格曼先生  还想玩把戏吗
Come on, Mr. Stigman. So you wanna play games?

243
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,960
你到底在想什么
Well, what'd you have in mind?

244
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,360
-你想救自己吗  -当然
-Do you wanna help yourself? -Yes.

245
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,160
我真要在他面前这么做吗
Do I have to do it in front of him?

246
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,880
好吧  谈话结束  谢谢  斯蒂格曼先生
All right, we're done here. Thank you, Mr. Stigman.

247
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,480
-你这就走了  -是的
-You gonna leave? -Oh, yes.

248
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
哇
Wow.

249
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
天啊
Oh, my God.

250
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,640
你跟她在一块怎么能专心工作的  兄弟
How do you concentrate workin' with her, man?

251
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,720
我们说话的功夫里  五名边界探员已经搜查过你的车了
Five border agents are rippin' apart your car as we speak.

252
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
他们什么都没找不到
They ain't gonna find anything.

253
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,490
你把可卡因藏在哪里了
Where'd you hide the cocaine?

254
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,640
-外面的人能听到吗  -听不到
-Can they hear us? -No.

255
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,250
-能看到我们吗  -看不到
-Can they see us? -No.

256
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,720
好吧
Okay.

257
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
根本就没有可卡因
There was no cocaine.

258
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,630
-你们在当地交易了  -是的
-You had a deal in place. -Right.

259
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,190
五百个护照来交换可卡因
Five hundred passports in return for cocaine.

260
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
是的
Right.

261
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,870
嘿  鲍比
Hey, Bobby.

262
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
过得好吗  黛比
How you doin', Deb?

263
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,240
很好  兄弟  你的手下斯蒂格是块好料子
Good. Man, your boy Stig's a piece of work.

264
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,920
他朝你抛媚眼了  是不是
He winked at you, didn't he?

265
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,240
你怎么知道的
How'd you know?

266
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,490
鲍比没拿到可卡因
Bobby didn't get the cocaine.

267
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,050
什么  怎么回事
What? What happened?

268
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,390
帕皮给了我现金  我拒绝了
Papi offered me cash. I told him no.

269
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
我让他把护照留着
I told him to keep the passports,

270
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,150
最后他肯定会交出可卡因的
so, eventually, he's gotta come up with the cocaine.

271
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,920
那你说可以拉拢的那个人怎么样  小托罗
What about this guy you said you could flip? Little Toro?

272
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,280
我就差一点就说服他了
I got him. It's real close.

273
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,720
我已经不知道你是谁了
I don't know who you are anymore.

274
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,640
就像...
It's like...

275
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,880
你已经脱离了组织
It's like you're out on this limb.

276
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,160
脱离得太远了
And you've been out there way too long.

277
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
你到底想说什么
And you're sayin' that to say what?

278
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
我可不想去我自己手下的葬礼
I don't like goin' to the funerals of my own men.

279
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,200
那就别来了  头儿  别来了
Well, then don't come, boss. Don't come.

280
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
好吗
Okay?

281
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
过去的三年里
I spent the last three years of my life

282
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,760
我在墨西哥苟且偷生
crawlin' through a Mexican sewer

283
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,280
一心想要抓到帕皮·格雷科
tryin' to work my way up the line to get next to Papi Greco.

284
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
你不能现在把我撤出去
You can't take me off this now.

285
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,240
杰瑟普  他快得手了
Jessup, he's close.

286
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
-不能现在把我撤出去  -我明白
-You can't take me off this now. -I know.

287
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,250
现在不行
Not now.

288
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,250
给你两个礼拜的时间
Two weeks.

289
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,610
如果那时候你还没拉拢小托罗  我就把你撤出去
You don't flip Little Toro by then, I'm pullin' ya out.

290
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,160
就这么说定了
We're done.

291
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
你觉得杰瑟普知道我们的事吗
Think Jessup knows about us?

292
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,160
"我们"的事  你从不在乎"我们"  不是吗
What "us"? You don't do "us," remember?

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
哦  好吧
Oh, I remember.

294
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,400
另外  我谈恋爱了
Besides, I'm dating.

295
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,510
好吧  你谈恋爱了...
Oh, right, right. You're dating...

296
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,670
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

297
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,840
你的假想男友  哈维
Your imaginary boyfriend, Harvey.

298
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,040
他不是我男朋友  他也不叫哈维
Uh, he's not my boyfriend, and his name's not Harvey.

299
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,320
我喜欢哈维这个名字  很好听
I like Harvey. It has a nice ring to it. Harvey.

300
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,510
你没资格吃醋  鲍比
You don't get to be jealous anymore, Bobby.

301
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,720
哈维
Harvey.

302
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,030
是你拒绝了我
You pushed me away.

303
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,560
所以你就和哈维在一起了
So you could be with Harvey.

304
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,250
去死吧你
Fuck you.

305
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,170
小托罗死了
Little Toro's dead.

306
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,120
可你告诉杰瑟普你快要拉拢他了
You told Jessup you were close to flipping him.

307
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,560
本来快了
I was.

308
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,590
但当我去农场的时候
But when I got down to the ranch,

309
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,760
我看到帕皮的手下把他的头装在袋子里
Papi's boys was throwin' his head around in a bag.

310
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
那也没办法
Well, that's game, then.

311
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,680
没有小托罗接应  杰瑟普会把你撤出去的
With Little Toro off the board, Jessup's pulling you out.

312
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,920
你不说  他就不会知道
Not if you don't tell him.

313
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,750
-我是你的上级  -是的
-I'm your control, Bobby. -That's correct.

314
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
我有责任告诉他
I have to tell him.

315
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,160
所以我才需要你
That's why I need you

316
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
批准我去抢特雷司·克鲁塞斯储贷银行
to let me rob Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

317
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,920
你要抢银行
You want to rob a bank?

318
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,280
不  是斯蒂格想要抢银行  是他的主意
No, Stig wants to rob the bank. It's his idea.

319
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,720
我们没有阴谋
So there's no entrapment.

320
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,390
我只是想拿到
What I want is access to that money

321
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,440
帕皮放在保险箱里的钱
that Papi's got in the safe deposit box.

322
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,150
要知道法官可不会批准
You know no judge is gonna give you

323
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,730
你去搜查那些保险箱的
a blanket warrant for the boxes.

324
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,760
不需要搜查令  因为那些钱是赃款
We don't need a warrant. Not if the money's evidence in a crime.

325
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,310
我们只要追查钱的来源
We just trace it back to ownership,

326
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,160
抓到帕皮偷税的证据  就能根据反诈骗法起诉他
we got Papi on tax evasion, possible RICO.

327
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,050
-是吗  -嗯
-Yeah? -Yeah.

328
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,350
那斯蒂格怎么办
And what about Stig?

329
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,440
怎么了
What about him?

330
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,840
他好办
He's a side dish.

331
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,270
当着银行人的面把他抓住
You bust him in front of the bank,

332
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,960
判他20年监禁  就大功告成了
he does a smooth 20 years in the penitentiary, you get a medal.

333
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,130
抢银行能让我们抓到帕皮
The bank gets us Papi.

334
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,600
你要的就是这样  是吧
And that's all that matters, right?

335
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,520
我会不惜一切代价的  宝贝
It takes whatever it takes, baby.

336
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
你爱过我吗
Did you ever really love me?

337
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,440
嗯
Hmm?

338
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
我很想爱你的
I really meant to love you.

339
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,320
该死
Shit.

340
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
门从来不关  你不用敲门
You don't have to knock. It's always open.

341
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,480
好  我们去抢银行吧
Yeah, good. Let's hit the bank.

342
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
去抢银行吧
Let's hit the bank.

343
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
-特雷司·克鲁塞斯储贷银行  -没错
-The Tres Cruces? -That's correct.

344
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,680
算了吧
Oh, shit.

345
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,770
入境的时候我们为什么被警察带走
Here I am still spinnin' about

346
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,790
我现在还一头雾水呢
how we got yanked outta line at the border.

347
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,640
那你去不去
So you in or you out?

348
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,920
我当然去  只是...
I'm in, yeah. It's just...

349
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,360
你以前遇到过这种事情吗
have you ever had anything like that happen to you before?

350
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,040
他们好像确信我们持有毒品
I mean, they were 100% convinced we were holding.

351
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,600
而且如果帕皮没耍滑头  我们确实会持有毒品
And we would've if Papi hadn't welched on that coke.

352
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,990
你说这些什么意思
So you're sayin' that to say what?

353
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,650
我就是说给你听听
I'm sayin' it's only 'cause you're hearin' it.

354
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,950
不  你肯定有什么意思
No, you sayin' somethin'.

355
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,190
你想跟我说什么
And if you sayin' it, I'm hearin' it 'cause you're sayin' it.

356
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,310
直说出来吧
What are you sayin'? Let it be said.

357
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,790
我觉得你他妈的是在玩我
I think you're fuckin' playin' me.

358
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,840
你想被玩吗
Are you wanna be played?

359
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,990
我跟着你10个月了
I've been at your hip for 10 months,

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,880
但出了这事  我觉得你可能是在玩我
but after this, I think maybe you're playin' me.

361
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,910
-你上当了  -不  我没有
-I got you. -No, you didn't.

362
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,390
你有  你眼角抽动了
Oh, I did. The corner of your eye was twitchin'.

363
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,970
眼角  我的眼角没抽动
The corner? That wasn't a twitch.

364
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,880
-那是抛媚眼  -那是我的招牌动作
-That was a wink. -That's my move.

365
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,600
那是帕皮胖得像圆球的儿子
Yup, that's Papi's chubby little kid right there.

366
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,890
整天吃油炸玉米粉饼...
Feed that motherfucker quesadillas...

367
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,150
天啊
Oh, my God.

368
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,190
她也很圆
She's chubby, too.

369
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,470
但圆的很是地方
In all the right places.

370
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
凭什么那个糟老头能娶到这样的美人
How does an old, fat, ugly fuck get a girl like that?

371
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,320
因为有钞票
Money.

372
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,520
好了  他来了
All right, here we go.

373
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,040
每隔两周
Same thing every two weeks.

374
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,150
帕皮都会带着一箱现金  乘飞机穿过边境
Papi flies over the border with a briefcase full of cash.

375
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,430
然后他陪妻子一周
He spends a week with the mistress.

376
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,750
费雷·诺斯·胡里奥把钱
Ferret Nose Julio drives it out

377
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,200
送到特雷司·克鲁塞斯储贷银行
to the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

378
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,430
现在有三百万了吧
Think they got three million in the bank, huh?

379
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,520
真是轻松
Easy.

380
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,200
来了
Bingo.

381
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,470
都是钱啊  都是钱啊
Money, money, money, money.

382
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,760
是啊
Oh, yeah.

383
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,350
你去餐馆点个甜甜圈怎么样
Why don't you hit the diner and check out the doughnuts?

384
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,400
说实话  我更想吃熏牛肉配土豆泥
I'm kinda more in a corned beef hash mood, to tell you the truth.

385
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
你没听过那句老话吗
You never heard the saying,

386
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,670
"永远不要抢三郡最佳
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

387
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,560
甜甜圈饭店对面的银行"
that has the best doughnuts in three counties"?

388
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,360
-没有这句老话  -有
-That's not a saying. -Yes, it is.

389
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,830
-这是你说的  不是什么老话  -你没听过吗
-I get what you're sayin', but it's not a saying. -You never heard it?

390
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,950
这现在是句老话了
It is a saying. It's a saying now.

391
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
好吧  不跟你废话了
Okay. Let you tell it.

392
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,480
行动吧
Make the move.

393
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,480
缉毒局不良探员
Bad DEA agent.

394
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,240
-我坏吗  -是的
-Am I bad? -Yes, you are.

395
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
我是个坏女孩
I'm a bad girl?

396
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
是的
Yes, you are.

397
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,240
斯蒂格决定明天3:00去抢劫银行
Stig decided to hit the bank tomorrow, 3:00.

398
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,800
斯蒂格决定
Stig decided?

399
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,560
无论我去不去  他都会去
Well, with or without me, he's goin' in.

400
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,440
我还没向杰瑟普报告
Well, I still haven't talked to Jessup.

401
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,120
斯蒂格不知道这个  明天三点他要行动了
Stig doesn't know that. 3:00 tomorrow he's goin' in.

402
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,560
如果我们想抓到帕皮  我得和他一起去
If we want Papi, I gotta go in with him.

403
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
你让我别无选择  不是吗
You're not even gonna give me a choice, are you?

404
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,080
我不让你选择是在保护你
I'm givin' you no other options as a way to protect you.

405
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,200
你去通知警方  明天3:05银行门口等着我们
Just have the troops meet me outside the bank, 3:05 when we come out.

406
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,350
3:05  是吗
3:05.

407
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,690
别朝我开枪
Okay. And don't shoot me.

408
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,920
-你看着办吧  -那我看看
-Even if you want to. -We'll see.

409
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
请出示证件  小伙子
License and registration, cowboy.

410
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
好样的
Cute.

411
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,270
-怎么了  提莫  -怎么了  哥们
-What's up, Teemo? -What's up, brother?

412
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,930
-还好吗  哥们  我很想你  -我也想你
-How are you, brother? I miss you, man. -I miss you, man.

413
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
给你留了一个火鸡汉堡  加了酱汁
Got you a turkey burger. Special sauce.

414
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,550
指挥官想见你
Commander wants to see you.

415
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
好的
Yes, sir.

416
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
快要成功了
So, half a mile from home.

417
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,760
鲍比已经跃跃欲试了
I got Bobby all wound up and ready to go, sir.

418
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
这是你申请的武器
Ordnance you requested.

419
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,510
知道吗  上将对你的表现很满意
Do you know, the Admiral's proud of what you've done.

420
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,750
离成功之差一步之遥
You've gone way out on a limb.

421
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,750
如果明天银行的计划成功
If the bank falls right tomorrow,

422
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,590
他答应把你调回来  重新回到队伍里
he says you can come in from the cold, rejoin your brothers.

423
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,230
太好了  能再穿上军装我就知足了
Great. Be good just to put the uniform back on, sir.

424
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,830
我参军可不是为了和毒贩一起违法乱纪的
I didn't join the Navy to commit felonies and hang with drug dealers.

425
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,800
你可是个出色的罪犯
Even if you're damn good at it?

426
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,680
我只是服从命令
I do what I do for the Navy, sir.

427
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,190
这些都是上将的计划
It's all part of the Admiral's plan.

428
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,550
我们把这三百万从银行里取出来
We get this three million from the bank,

429
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,910
就能采取跨界行动  捣毁帕皮他们的窝点
we run cross-border ops on Papi and all the other cartels.

430
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,040
所以明天的目标只有一个
So tomorrow, clean and precise.

431
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,230
就是拿走保险箱里所有的钱  一分不剩  明白吗
Tick all the boxes, nothing left undone. You got it?

432
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,680
明白
Yes, sir.

433
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,440
出发
Let's go.

434
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,360
嘿  夹克不错
Hey, nice jacket.

435
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,430
嘿  告诉你母亲一声
Hey, tell your mother she's gotta move out

436
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,010
她得从我的房子里搬出去了
of my house at some point, man.

437
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,080
你要哪个头套  小丑还是怪物
All right, what do you want, clown or Frankie?

438
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,050
怪物
Frankie.

439
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,760
你用那22块干什么了
So, what'd you do with the 22?

440
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,240
我从我表哥那里买了台咖啡机
Traded to my cousin for an espresso machine.

441
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,640
那你需要特制的咖啡豆  是吧
You're gonna need special beans for that, right?

442
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,230
停  停
Uh, uh, uh.

443
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,680
你可以掏手枪  不过你可要想好了
You can reach for your firearm, but do it real slow.

444
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,400
这楼里还有其他人吗
Any other people in the buildin'?

445
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,950
-这是怎么回事  -抢银行
-What the hell is this? -It's a bank robbery.

446
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,270
只是先把你们关起来
Only instead of robbin' the bank

447
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,590
这样过一会儿
and lettin' you chase after us,

448
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,440
你们就不用追着我们傻跑了
we decided to come after you first.

449
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
走吧
Let's go.

450
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
{\an8}警察局

451
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,930
把枪交给我
All right, give me your gun, there.

452
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,760
所有人都坐下  坐在地上
All right, everybody sit down. Everybody sit down on the floor.

453
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,710
柜台后面的女士  把手举起来  不要放在警报器上
Ladies behind the counter, keep your hands visible, not on the alarms.

454
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
快走  快走
Let's go, let's go!

455
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,240
别怕  姑娘们  把抽屉里所有的钱都给他们  
It's all right, girls. Just give 'em the drawer cash.

456
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,240
我们说要抽屉里的钱了吗
Did we ask for the drawer cash?

457
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,670
快点  坐下  坐下
Come on, come on, come on. Sit right here. Sit, sit.

458
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,190
坐在地上
Let's go, on the floor.

459
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,680
-嘿  小心那个保安  -嘿  嘿
-Hey, guard! -Hey! Hey.

460
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,680
不要敬酒不吃  好吗
Look, I'm tryin' to be polite, all right?

461
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,760
好好坐着  一会就好了
Just sit tight and this'll be over soon.

462
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,320
打开门
Open the gate.

463
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,430
我没有钥匙
I don't have a key.

464
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
你说什么
What'd you say?

465
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
好了
Easy.

466
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,430
如果你再骗我一次  你就要倒霉了
You lie to me again, it's gonna be more than a fuckin' problem.

467
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
滚过去
Get out there, now.

468
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,910
在地上坐好
Get on the floor.

469
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,570
准备好了吗  我进去了
You good? I'm goin' in.

470
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,760
嘘  没事的
Shh. It's all right.

471
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,570
哦  蒂莫西
Oh, Timothy.

472
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,480
嘿  别怕
Hey, it's okay.

473
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,330
别怕  嗯
It's okay. Yeah?

474
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,960
好了  给你
Okay. Here you go.

475
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,120
烟火表演马上开始
Showtime! Fire in the hole!

476
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,530
糟糕
Holy shit!

477
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,990
嘿  怪物  有点不对劲
Hey, Frankie, somethin's not right.

478
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,880
所有的箱子都装满现金
They're all stuffed with money.

479
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,840
你说过只有一两箱现金的
I thought you said there would only be one or two.

480
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,760
每个里面都是现金
Every single one of them.

481
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,080
一共有32个保险箱
I'm at 32 boxes and counting.

482
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,120
肯定不止三百万
Look, there's way more than 3 million.

483
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,160
这里还有很多
And there's still a lot more here.

484
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,800
好吧  全带走  以后再数
All right, well, take 'em all. We'll figure it out later.

485
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,070
你先走  我去搬剩下的
You go ahead, I'll get the rest.

486
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,160
好吧
All right.

487
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
听着
Listen.

488
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,790
等会外面可能会有枪响
May be gunfire outside, okay? So if it hits,

489
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
你带着大家躲到柜台后面
you get everybody behind the counters.

490
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,110
这是对面警察局牢房的钥匙
This is for the jail across the street.

491
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,280
你去把那里的警察放出来
You let the cops out. Let'em out.

492
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,040
快点
Come on.

493
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,880
这是可远远不止三百万美元
That is a hell of a lot more than $3 million.

494
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,160
你数了有多少了吗
How much, you figure?

495
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,800
我们今天难道是走了狗屎运
We couldn't be the luckiest chumps on the face of the earth, could we?

496
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,640
-你觉得幸运  -不
-You feel lucky? -No, I don't.

497
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,370
这不是帕皮的钱
I mean, this can't be Papi's money.

498
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,430
拿了这些钱  他们肯定会追着我们不放
People are gonna chase us off the end of the earth for money like this.

499
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,920
不好意思  斯蒂格  但我有个不幸的消息...
Well, I hate to tell you this, Stig, but I got more bad news...

500
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,840
把手慢慢地从背后拿出来  鲍比
You take that hand away nice and slow, Bobby.

501
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
好了
Okay.

502
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,530
把枪放下  斯蒂格
Put the gun down, Stig.

503
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,590
知道吗  我很喜欢你
You know I really like you, right?

504
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
我也很喜欢你
I like you, too.

505
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,280
-不  你不喜欢我  -我喜欢你
-No, you don't. -Yes, I do.

506
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,230
没人喜欢我  而且我习惯了
Nobody likes me, okay? And I'm okay with it.

507
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,680
我喜欢你  你比其他人都好
I do. I like you more than most.

508
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,590
是因为我拿着枪指着你  你才这么说的吗
You're not just sayin' it 'cause I got a gun pointed to you?

509
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
为什么不把枪放下来呢
Why don't you just put the gun down?

510
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,830
该死
Shit.

511
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,950
哦
Oh.

512
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,760
没搞错吧
Hot-doggin'!

513
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
抱歉了  哥们
I'm sorry, man.

514
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,080
你为什么要这么做
What'd you do that for?

515
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,890
-我不得不这么做  -不可能
-Shit, man, I had to! -No, you didn't.

516
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,950
就是一点皮肉伤  没事的
It's just a little flesh wound. You'll be all right.

517
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,640
喝点药  你就没事了...
Drink the water, and then you'll be able...

518
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,010
那是什么
What is that?

519
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,680
你手里拿的是警徽吗
In your hand. Is that a badge in your hand?

520
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,470
别他妈告诉我  你是个内鬼
Tell me you're not a no-good, two-timin' son of a bitch.

521
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,550
内鬼
Two-timin'?

522
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,480
-快说  -是你开枪打了我
-Tell me. -You shot me.

523
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,560
等一下  等一下
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, man. Hang on.

524
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,280
别走
No, you wait a minute.

525
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,760
斯蒂格
Stig.

526
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,280
嘿
Hey.

527
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,200
美国是世界上最伟大的国家
The United States is the greatest country in the world

528
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,360
因为我们可以接受人们
because we accept a man is, at his core,

529
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,240
贪婪
greedy,

530
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,720
自私
selfish

531
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,520
的本性
and covetous.

532
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,200
我没办法  他们抢走了钥匙
I had no choice. They took my key.

533
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,160
我不是心甘情愿地打开金库门的
I would never willingly open the vault.

534
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,360
把手放在桌子上
Keep your hands on the desk, please.

535
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,360
在美国人人平等
In America, we line everybody up.

536
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,720
所以  "人定胜天"
Say, "You're on your own."

537
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,520
"抓住一切机会"
"Grab all you can grab."

538
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,040
我是无辜的
I'm innocent.

539
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,040
没有人是无辜的
Nobody's innocent, friend.

540
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,080
这世间只有罪恶
There's just the guilty,

541
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,410
和狂妄
the ignorant

542
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,810
还有不幸
and the unlucky.

543
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,640
是不是你拿了我的钱
Did you take our money?

544
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
你们看来就像等车一样悠哉
You fellas look like you're waitin' for a bus.

545
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,230
你完事了告诉我们一声
You guys let us know when you're done.

546
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,400
我完事了  谢谢你们配合
Oh, I'm done, and thank you for the courtesy.

547
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
他是谁
Who is that guy?

548
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,270
你听说过上帝魔手吗
You heard of the hidden hand of God?

549
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,240
那家伙就是
Well, that's God's son of a bitch.

550
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,560
打电话给DDO  查出哪些人知道我们放了钱在这儿
Call the DDO and get a list of everyone who knew we had money in this bank.

551
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,920
你俩不觉得戴上墨镜很白痴吗
You two realize those sunglasses make you look like assholes.

552
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,270
打扰下  那家餐馆啥时候爆炸的
Excuse me, when'd that diner burn?

553
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,390
昨天
Yesterday.

554
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,790
我要见餐馆服务员
I want interviews with the wait staff

555
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,110
和所有在场的客人
and every customer in the place.

556
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,770
只是机油引起火灾而已
It was just a grease fire.

557
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,480
我有问你吗  高莫
Did I ask your opinion, Gomer?

558
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,070
你有听说过
You ever hear the saying,

559
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,870
"永远不要抢三郡最佳
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

560
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,000
甜甜圈饭店对面的银行"
with the best doughnuts in three counties"?

561
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,120
如果那家餐馆火灾纯属巧合
If that diner fire's a coincidence,

562
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,600
那是因为我们一直看得不够严
it's only 'cause we ain't looking hard enough.

563
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,200
那可是好大一笔钱
That is an impressive amount of greenbacks.

564
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,930
4312.5万美金  长官
43,125,000 of 'em, sir.

565
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
好
Mmm.

566
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,350
重新数下  装起来  我们藏到库里面  
Recount it. Pack it up. We'll stow it back in Corpus.

567
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,270
我印象中应该从那银行拿到
It was my impression we were supposed to come out of that bank

568
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,790
最多300万美金  长官
with 3 million at most, sir.

569
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,110
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

570
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,160
这些钱是谁的
Whose money was it?

571
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,970
坏人不值得拥有
Bad men unworthy of it.

572
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,320
你知道鲍比·宾斯是缉毒局的吗
Did you know Bobby Beans was DEA?

573
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
不知道
No, I didn't.

574
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,320
无意冒犯  你的表情不够惊讶
No offense, sir, but you really need to work on your surprised face.

575
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,570
如果他是缉毒局的  却帮你打劫银行
Well, if he was DEA, he helped you rob a bank.

576
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
非正义所为  我决不饶恕银行劫匪
Which means he's dirty, and for that, I have no mercy.

577
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,560
-你把他丢在哪了  -沙漠
-Where'd you leave him? -In the desert.

578
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,760
-他死了吗  -差不多
-Is he dead? -More than likely.

579
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,970
"差不多"
"More than likely."

580
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,760
你知道这意味着什么吗
You wanna tell me what that means?

581
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,150
让你和鲍比·宾斯合作就是为了
The whole point of you working with Bobby Beans

582
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,510
灭掉他  斩草除根
was to kill him off and create a cut-out

583
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,150
监管所就查不到我们头上来了
so the OP couldn't get traced back to us.

584
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,110
我掩饰得天衣无缝  我们不会被查到的
My cover's solid. There's no way it'll trace back.

585
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,710
我掩饰得天衣无缝  我们不会被查到的  长官
My cover is solid. There's no way it'll trace back, sir.

586
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,880
这里轮得到你做决定吗
That's a call made above your pay grade.

587
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,720
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

588
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,240
派两个人把钱藏到海军基地
Assign two of the boys to stow the money back at the naval base.

589
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,560
其他人跟我们去找宾斯的尸体
The rest'll come with us to check on the body of Mr. Beans.

590
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,360
斯蒂格曼  要一起来吗
Stigman, wanna come with me?

591
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,800
-你好啊  伙计  -你好
-Hey there, buddy. -Hey.

592
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,070
你是墨西哥的吗  
You habla?

593
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
是  是
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,590
我是
I hablo.

595
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,790
好  那就好
Good, that's good.

596
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,960
没看到证件前  别信他
Don't trust in him till you see his paper.

597
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,680
如果他有证件  我会看的  你有  对吧  
If he's got papers, I'll see his papers. You got papers, right?

598
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,080
不  不  我没证件
No. No, I got no papers.

599
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,960
那就麻烦了
Well, that's gonna be a problem.

600
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,230
瘦杰和我自愿来这
See, Slim Jay and me, we done assigned ourselves

601
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,390
保护边境
protection this here stretch of the border.

602
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,720
既是执行公务  也是个人意愿
Officially unofficially.

603
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,840
所以我们必须检查你的证件
So we really gonna have to see your papers.

604
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,000
确认你是不是穆斯林啥的
Make sure you ain't no Muslim or nothin'.

605
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,320
是吧  有  我有证件的
Oh, yeah. No, I do have it.

606
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,520
拿你的枪过来
And let me have your gun.

607
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,240
给我
Give it to me.

608
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,040
谢谢
Gracias.

609
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,640
你知道怎么祈祷吧
You know how to pray?

610
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,570
提莫  进展怎样啦  伙计们
Teemo. How we doin', boys?

611
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,760
有看到鲍比·宾斯吗
Any sign of Bobby Beans?

612
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,920
查遍了东南片区
Checked all the washes to the southeast.

613
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,800
没发现尸体
No sign of a body.

614
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,040
好吧
All right.

615
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,370
斯蒂格  你让我们大失所望
Well, Stig, you put us in quite a hole.

616
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,270
我不这样认为  长官  您才是指挥官
I don't see it that way, sir, but you're the man with the oak leaves.

617
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,120
你曾经让我引以为豪
All that pride I had in you.

618
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,040
对我忠心耿耿
That loyalty?

619
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,590
现在你不再值得信任
You just tossed it to the wind

620
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,720
是的  长官  抱歉
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

621
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,120
该死的
God damn it.

622
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,770
他不见了
He's in the wash!

623
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,490
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

624
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,040
快把他找出来
Come on, let's flush him out!

625
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,640
你去哪儿  斯蒂格曼
Where you going, Stigman?

626
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,720
逃跑也没用
It doesn't matter if you run.

627
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,360
你被通缉了  现在你是刺伤宪兵后在逃6个月的逃兵
Your jacket's wired, so you're six-months AWOL after stabbing an MP.

628
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,510
无论你联系谁  他们都会
You talk to anyone, they're just gonna

629
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,090
把你交回给我处置
hand you right back over to me.

630
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,200
你没事吧
You all right?

631
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,640
-没事  -那就他妈的赶快起来
-Yeah. -Then get your ass up!

632
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
扔掉枪
Toss the gun.

633
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
他妈的
Fuck!

634
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
快
Move!

635
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
赶快  赶快
Come on, come on!

636
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,760
该死
Damn it!

637
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,330
天啊  我该怎么弄啊
Jesus! What am I supposed to do with this?

638
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,640
天啊
Aw, man. Aw!

639
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
不是吧
Come on.

640
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,800
我是个兽医  不是外科医生
I'm a vet, not a trauma surgeon.

641
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,440
我帮不了你了  你走吧
I can't help you with this, man. You gotta go.

642
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
走去哪
Go where?

643
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,560
你离开吧  我帮不了
You gotta leave. I can't do anything.

644
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,210
肯尼  你记得几个月之前
Kenny, you remember a couple of months ago

645
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,440
说要卖500支氯胺酮给我吗
you offered to sell me 500 hits of ketamine?

646
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,150
记得  你说没兴趣
Yeah, you said you weren't interested.

647
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,320
对
Right.

648
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,200
因为我是缉毒局探员
'Cause I'm a DEA agent.

649
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
如果你不治好我
And if you don't fix me up,

650
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,120
我就去药管局
I'm gonna go to the D.A.,

651
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,680
告诉他们你喜欢在多莉·艾莫丝的演唱会上游荡
I'm gonna tell them that you like cruising Tori Amos concerts,

652
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,800
卖K粉给那些眼泪汪汪的小女生
selling Special K to little weepy college girls.

653
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,160
你不可能是警察
There's no way you're a cop.

654
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,360
-不可能  -对
-No? -No.

655
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,760
-你确定吗  -我确定
-You sure? -I'm positive.

656
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,160
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

657
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,950
也有权让律师陪审
You have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.

658
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,990
还要我继续下去吗
Do I need to keep going?

659
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,750
不  我信了  你是警察
No, I'm good. You're a cop.

660
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,960

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,210
-你昨天迟到了  -天啊
-You were late. -Jesus Christ.

670
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,690
到底发生什么事了
What the hell happened?

671
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,640
-不好意思  -不好意思  让下
-Excuse us. -Excuse me.

672
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,710
我打劫银行了啊  你呢
I robbed a bank. What happened to you?

673
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,240
我和6个探员3:05到达那里
I was there with six agents at 3:05.

674
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,730
-不  你没有  -我有
-No, you weren't. -Yes, I was.

675
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,910
你迟到了
You were late.

676
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,200
是你早离开了
You went early.

677
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,510
看来你并没适时亮出警徽
And it's not as if you couldn't have

678
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,480
阻止他抢劫
pulled your badge at any time and stopped it.

679
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,350
-我阻止了  但斯蒂格射了我一枪  -什么
-I did. Stig shot me. -What?

680
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,160
我肩膀中枪了
He shot me in the shoulder.

681
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,480
我们得带你去医院
We gotta take you to the hospital.

682
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,000
然后打断你和哈维的约会  我可不想这样
And interrupt your rendezvous with Harvey? I don't think so.

683
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,450
我们现在必须做的是
This is what we need to do,

684
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,920
找到斯蒂格和钱
we need to find Stig, we need to find the money.

685
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
好  听着
All right. Listen.

686
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,430
先让我上楼找编个借口离开
Let me go upstairs, make my excuses,

687
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,720
然后我们一起去找斯蒂格  好吗
and then we'll find Stig together, okay?

688
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,680
好  我们这样吧  这样
Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

689
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,490
你再查下斯蒂格的底
Why don't you recheck Stig's background?

690
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,800
可能我们漏掉了什么  好吗
Maybe there was something that we missed. All right?

691
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,480
我现在去斯蒂格家  看下能找到什么
I'm going to Stig's apartment and see what I can find out.

692
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
-好吗  -好
-All right? -Okay.

693
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,130
代我向哈维问好
Tell Harvey I said hi.

694
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,680
你帮谁包扎伤口了
Who'd you patch up?

695
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,970
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

696
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,200
我在说什么
What am I talkin' about?

697
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,160
外面停着辆沙地车
Well, there's a dune buggy parked out back

698
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,880
是一个中枪的人偷的
that was stolen by a man with a bullet hole in him.

699
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,970
在他中枪前
Now, before he had a bullet hole in him,

700
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,040
他炸了一个饭店  打劫了银行
he burned down a diner and robbed a bank.

701
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,320
我什么都不知道  所以...
I don't know anything about that, so...

702
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,040
好吧
Okay.

703
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,990
好
Okay?

704
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,080
很好
Fair enough.

705
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,320
我这样问你吧
Say, let me ask you somethin'.

706
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,370
你有玩过俄罗斯轮盘赌吗
You ever play Russian roulette?

707
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,880
当然没有  我在想什么呢
'Course not. What am I thinkin'?

708
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,560
主要是  大多数人
The thing is, most people,

709
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
都把枪放在太阳穴上
they put the gun to the temple.

710
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,490
嗯  那太笨了
And that's, well, that's just stupid.

711
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,360
假如
What if...

712
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,840
子弹在第一膛怎么办呢
The bullet's in the first chamber?

713
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,350
你在人家还有机会告诉你想知道的事之前
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

714
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,440
就让人家脑袋开花了
to tell you what you want to know.

715
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,110
不  不  不  不要啊
No. No, no. Come on, man.

716
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,920
多好的例子
Case in point.

717
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,960
斯蒂格
Stig!

718
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,160
斯蒂格
Stig.

719
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,840
接电话  鲍比
Pick up, Bobby.

720
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,080
你他妈的来这干嘛啊  鲍比
What the fuck are you doing here, Bobby?

721
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,750
你躲个屁啊
What're you duckin' for, man?

722
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,410
你知道我在算计你  对吧
You know I set you up, right?

723
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,960
他们告诉我你的底了
They told me all about you.

724
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,520
很难对付  交游广阔  没有亲人
Tough cat. Knows everybody. Doesn't have people.

725
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,600
这样的人最适合清除
That guy? Well, shit, that guy's a perfect cut-out.

726
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,920
要是给他一枪  也没人会在乎的  对吧
I mean, he takes a bullet, who's gonna care, right?

727
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,930
接电话
Pick up the phone.

728
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,920
接那个破电话  鲍比
Pick up the damn phone, Bobby.

729
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,160
你有话要说吗
You got anything to say?

730
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,310
第一个问题
First question,

731
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,830
如果你是缉毒局的  清白的  为什么一个人来
if you're DEA and you're clean, why are you here alone?

732
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,520
你的幕后黑手是谁  鲍比
Where's your backup, Bobby?

733
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,270
你这种态度
Come on, it's this kind of attitude

734
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,120
让我觉得你不是好人
makes me think you're not one of the good guys.

735
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,510
如果我想的话  在你进入
If I wanted you, I could've had you

736
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,680
那栋楼之前就可以把你毙了  鲍比
before you walked into that building, Bobby.

737
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,320
好酷的枪  斯蒂格
That's a beautiful rifle, Stig.

738
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,890
是部队的吗
Is that Army issue?

739
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,560
{\an8}凯马特是美国最大的折扣零售商

740
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,560
你喜欢吗  不  从凯马特买回来的  特价
You like that? No, it's Kmart. Blue Light Special.

741
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,840
现在回答我  你的幕后指使者是谁
Now answer my question. Where's your backup?

742
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,400
不  不  那是军用枪
No, no, that's a military rifle.

743
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,160
军队为什么要打劫银行  斯蒂格
What's the military doing robbing banks, Stig?

744
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,870
我们可以坦诚相待吗  鲍比
Can we just have a straight-up conversation, Bobby?

745
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,480
我让你右脑袋开花吧
I got you dead to rights.

746
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,400
是吗  那射我吧
Yeah? So shoot me.

747
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,000
第二次了
Again.

748
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,920
不射吗
No?

749
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,560
那我来吧
I'll shoot myself.

750
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,550
哈  手法不错嘛
Huh. Not bad.

751
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,720
谢谢欣赏
I'm glad you're impressed.

752
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,710
你在试我会不会先开枪  对吗
Were you testing me to see if I would shoot first?

753
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,160
钱在哪里  斯蒂格
Where's the money, Stig?

754
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,230
如果你是清白的  也许可以告诉你  但你不是
If I thought you were clean, I might tell you, but I don't, so I can't.

755
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,840
你说谎  钱不在你这  对吧  到底在哪里
You're lying. You don't have it, do you? Where's the money?

756
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,600
-噢  不是吧  -怎么了
-Oh, shit. -What?

757
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,470
原来不只有你
You're not the only one I was expecting.

758
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,880
三个恶心的人刚出现了
Three very nasty men just showed up.

759
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,960
如果在我家发现你  后果就严重了
If they find you in my place, they will get ugly.

760
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,200
他们是谁
Who are they?

761
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,630
昨天我还说  和他们是一家人
Yesterday I'd have said they were my family.

762
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,070
今天他们就要来杀我了
Today they kinda wanna kill me.

763
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,760
-我明白你的感受  -去你的
-I understand the feeling. -You know, fuck you.

764
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,800
你知道什么是家吗  你连家人都没有
What do you know about family? You don't even have people.

765
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,110
不  鲍比  别走那
No, Bobby, that's a stupid idea.

766
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,200
他们已经上楼了
They're already comin' up the stairs.

767
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,600
鲍比
Bobby!

768
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,050
跟你说过了  现在这样  鲍比
I told you. Now, Bobby,

769
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,310
把扬声器关了  接你的手机  好吗
hang up the speaker and answer your cell phone, okay?

770
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,920
如果要我帮忙的话...
If you want me to help you out...

771
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,790
说
Yeah.

772
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,880
先呆在阴影处  好吗
Just stay in the shadows, okay?

773
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,360
我会引导你逃出来
I'm gonna guide you out from there.

774
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,080
等下
Wait.

775
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
等下
Wait.

776
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,590
他在你后面  你最好冲过大厅吧
He's comin' up your rear. You better dart across the hall.

777
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,400
去卧室  躲在柜后面
Go over to the bedroom and hide behind the lockers.

778
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,640
快
Go.

779
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,200
好  鲍比  你冲过去大厅  快
All right, Bobby, you're gonna wanna scoot across the hall. Go.

780
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,390
鲍比  
Bobby, Bob...

781
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,160
他妈的
Shit.

782
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,320
-提莫  -屋顶
-Teemo! -Rooftop!

783
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,320
目标在移动
Target's on the move!

784
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
抱歉  提莫
Sorry, Teemo.

785
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,120
我们的钱在哪
Where's our money?

786
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talkin' about.

787
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,330
你觉得缉毒局冲进我们银行
You think DEA can just waltz into our bank,

788
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,720
偷走我们的钱  我们不会反抗吗
steal our money, and we're not gonna kick?

789
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,880
你的伙计鲍比·特伦奇偷了我们4300万美金
Your man Bobby Trench stole 43 million of our dollars.

790
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,800
我们想要回来
We'd like it back.

791
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,920
因为本来就是我们的
Because it's our money.

792
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,920
因为这大逆不道啊
Because it's a blatant act of disrespect.

793
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,200
因为钱是我们的
And because it's our money.

794
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,560
你终于打来了  鲍比
Please tell me it's you, Bobby.

795
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,720
有斯蒂格的新资料吗
Anything new on Stig?

796
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,640
我找到的所有资料都显示他是清白的
He's comin' up clean on every database I'm cleared for.

797
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,080
没有军方关系吗  没有服役记录
No military connection? No record of service?

798
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,810
要更深入调查  要得到杰瑟普的授权
To go deeper, I'd need to get clearance from Jessup.

799
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,230
试下找你在军队的老同事吧
Well, try your old contacts in the military.

800
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,000
我要把知道的一切都告诉杰瑟普
I'm gonna tell Jessup everything I know.

801
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,400
等下  你确定吗
Wait, are you sure?

802
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,080
肯定会有人知道银行的钱是谁的
Someone has to know whose money was in the bank.

803
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,480
有啊  斯蒂格
Yeah. Stig.

804
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,230
斯蒂格连我是缉毒局的都不知道
Stig didn't even know I was DEA.

805
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,760
而且也有人在追杀他
Besides, somebody tried to kill him, too.

806
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,680
鲍比  让我帮你  你需要什么
Bobby, let me help you. What do you need?

807
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,250
别着急  再见
Take it easy. Bye.

808
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,640
鲍比
Bobby.

809
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
去你的
Fuck!

810
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,480
连一个人都拿不下  关门
That's how you take down a man. Now shut the door.

811
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,450
死就死吧
Just let it come.

812
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,680
罗伯特·林恩·特伦奇探员
Agent Robert Lynn Trench.

813
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,530
也叫鲍比·T  鲍比·B  鲍比·宾斯
A.k.a. Bobby T, a.k.a. Bobby B, a.k.a. Bobby Beans.

814
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,290
我们来聊聊吧
Let's have a chat.

815
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,070
你偷了4312.5万美金
You stole $43.125 million

816
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,320
这不属于你的
that did not belong to you.

817
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,080
实话实说
Now, man-to-man,

818
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,160
缉毒局里面谁指使你打劫我们银行的
who at DEA authorized you to rob our bank?

819
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,560
你是银行家吗
You a banker?

820
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,840
你玩过俄罗斯轮盘赌吗
You ever play Russian roulette?

821
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,880
主要是
Thing is,

822
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,880
大多数人都把枪放在太阳穴上
most people put the gun to the temple.

823
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,040
那简直蠢到家了
Well, that's just stupid.

824
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,110
你在人家还有机会告诉你想知道的事之前
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

825
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,320
就把别人打死了
to tell you what you wanna know.

826
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,920
还弄的自己一身脏
Mess up your suit, too.

827
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,350
谁借你豹子胆来偷我们的钱的
Who told you it was all right to take our money?

828
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,480
"你们的钱  你们的银行"
"Our money. Our bank."

829
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,080
你谁啊
Who are ya?

830
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,560
你如果不知道我是谁
If you don't know who I am,

831
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,920
你怎么把4千3百万钱给偷走的
how did you know to steal our 43 million?

832
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,840
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

833
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,650
-你不知道  -的确不知道
-You don't? -No.

834
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,240
这样啊...
Well...

835
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,120
那钱哪儿去了
Where's the money?

836
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,610
我的天啊
Oh, boy.

837
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,930
说实话...
Well, uh...

838
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,120
我可以担保  钱肯定不在这下面
it ain't down there, I can guarantee you that.

839
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,250
哇哦  哇哦
Whoo-hoo.

840
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,750
不愧外号  鲍比·蛋蛋
A.k.a. Bobby Balls.

841
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,280
干净利落  妥妥的
Clean and shaven.

842
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,010
你知道  你算什么吗
You know what you are?

843
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,320
你
You

844
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,680
就是个变节的缉毒局条子
are a dirty DEA agent.

845
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,810
没错
That's right.

846
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,800
你就是个抢银行  杀上司的
You're a dirty DEA agent who robbed a bank.

847
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,480
变节缉毒局条子
And shot your boss.

848
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,800
不管你到哪个政府部门申诉
You walk into any federal office,

849
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,360
你都会得到这个结果
and that's the story they're gonna have.

850
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,400
要不然你就给我4312.5万美刀
Unless you bring me $43.125 million,

851
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,970
那你无债走人  轻松
and you walk away. Clean.

852
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,640
我跟你说清楚  讲明白了吗
Have I properly incentivized you?

853
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,240
不能再明白了
More than you know.

854
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,200
除非你想老死在监狱里  不然的话你最好搞定这事情
Unless you wanna rot in jail, you best get after it.

855
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,960
去吧  快去吧
Go on, now. Go on.

856
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,520
好吧
All right.

857
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,800
你觉得  他不是罪有应得吗
You're thinkin' he deserved better?

858
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,480
你没感觉错
You're right.

859
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,530
嘿  鲁迪
Hey, Rudy.

860
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,440
好啊  哈维尔
Hola, Javier.

861
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,850
早啊  帕皮
Morning, Papi.

862
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
别乱动
Don't move.

863
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,390
快进去
Go inside, quick.

864
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,400
老妈
Mommy!

865
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,000
我们偷的钱  到底是谁的
Whose money did we steal?

866
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,160
你真想知道
You really wanna know?

867
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,840
我真想知道
I really wanna know.

868
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,590
别乱来  老家伙  进去  给我进去
Easy, old man, get in there. Get in there.

869
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,600
我到时候报复死你
Payback's a bitch!

870
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,910
报复死你啊
Payback's a bitch!

871
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,950
哦  哦  哦
Uh, uh, uh.

872
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,110
-哇哦  鲍比  -把枪放下  把钥匙给我
-Whoa, Bobby. -Drop the gun. Give me the keys.

873
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,630
把钥匙给我  慢慢的来
Give me the keys. Nice and easy.

874
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,600
我做不到
I can't do that.

875
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,750
-为什么  -我先抓到他的  先下手为强
-Why not? -Well, I got him first. I got dibs.

876
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,310
我还抓这点44呢  帕皮我提走了  把钥匙给我
I got a .44. I'm taking Papi. Give me the keys.

877
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,640
你要钥匙  你自己来拿
You want 'em? Come get 'em.

878
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,990
我看到那眼珠骨溜溜的转起来了
Now, I see the wheels turnin'.

879
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,110
你在想要不用蒙眼布  也许用牙齿好一点
You're thinkin' a little blindfold, maybe use your teeth.

880
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,400
我没想这东西  你知道我在想什么吗
That's not what I'm thinkin'. You know what I'm thinkin'?

881
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,120
我了个草  伙计  这算什么
Oh, shit, man. How's that?

882
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,880
打脸都不打声招呼
That was uncalled for.

883
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,270
操  我还是喜欢那个"很有门路"的鲍比
Shit. I liked you better when you were "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

884
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,950
那个鲍比还是个好人
That Bobby was a good guy.

885
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,030
我喜欢没事对女服务员眉来眼去
Well, I liked you better when you were winkin' at waitresses

886
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,750
枪扫鸡头的你
and shootin' the heads off of chickens.

887
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,600
把钥匙给我  把钥匙给我
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.

888
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,920
我操
Shit!

889
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,080
-你还会开枪的  -没错  把钥匙给我
-You saw that move comin'? -That's correct. Give me the keys.

890
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,760
见了个鬼了  你还真倔啊
Damn, you're good.

891
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,040
反正总要有人弯腰捡钥匙的
Now, one of us is gonna have to pick up those keys.

892
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,040
-你猜啊  -好吧  我去捡  行了吧
-Guess. -All right. I'll get 'em, all right?

893
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,880
-捡起来  捡起来  -把钱移开点  伙计
-Get 'em, get 'em. -Put that musket away, man.

894
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,480
-嘿  停下来  -停下来
-Hey, pull over! -Pull over?

895
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,360
嘿  帕皮  你觉得我开车爽吗
Hey, Papi, you like my drivin'?

896
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,520
我操
Oh, shit!

897
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,880
你来啊  鲍比  我可没空整天陪你的啊
Come on, Bobby, I ain't got all damn day!

898
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,520
你到底想干什么
What do you wanna do?

899
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,560
哦
Ow!

900
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,280
够了  够了  够了  放开我
All right. All right, all right. All right, let me go.

901
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,470
你先放开我
You let me go first.

902
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,520
不行  你放开我
No, you let me go.

903
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,290
数三下  一起放
On three. On three.

904
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,080
一  二  三
One. Two. Three.

905
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,910
看到没  你现在给我不相信你的理由了
See? Now you're making me not be able to trust you.

906
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,520
说话算话  数三下  我们都放手
On the count of three, we'll let each other go.

907
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,910
-好吗  -好吧  互不吃亏
-All right? -All right. That's fair.

908
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,120
一  二
One. Two.

909
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,280
三
Three.

910
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,510
我就知道  放开我
I knew it. Let me go.

911
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,750
-不放  -那我放开你  我放你
-No! -I'm gonna let you go. I'm gonna let you go.

912
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,040
-好的  -一...
-All right. -One...

913
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,640
哦
Ow!

914
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,240
哦
Ow!

915
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,770
老实说  伙计  你不得不承认这样够尽兴  对吧
Come on, man. You gotta admit, that was kind of fun, no?

916
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,130
你不喜欢啊
You didn't like that?

917
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,640
你到底是谁啊
Who are you?

918
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,080
见鬼
Shit.

919
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,160
-美国海军情报员  -是吗
-U.S. Navy Intel. -Yeah?

920
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,560
起码我以前是
Or I was.

921
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,070
我的上级制造假象
My commander FUBARed my jacket.

922
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,150
说我捅了个宪兵后擅自失踪了
And now I'm AWOL after stabbing an MP.

923
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,760
你还算好的呢  他们诬陷我杀害上司
You're lucky. They got me framed for killing my boss.

924
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,280
那你上司派你最要好的四个朋友来干掉你吗
Did your boss order your four closest friends to kill you?

925
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,210
没有  算你的狠
No, you got me there.

926
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,210
海军士官迈克尔·斯蒂格曼
Petty Officer Michael Stigman.

927
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,530
缉毒局探员鲍比·特伦奇  但我猜你早就知道了
DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but I guess you know that already.

928
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,680
荣幸荣幸
Pleasure.

929
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,190
那怎么说呢  是你碰巧遇上我的
So, what, you just happened to pick me,

930
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,160
还是上头派你来故意跟我对着干的
or you got orders to set me up on purpose?

931
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,430
我有命在身啊  伙计  我也不知道你是缉毒局的人
I had orders, man. I didn't know you were DEA.

932
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,630
我的人知道  但他们情报局的
My people did. But they're Intel.

933
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,830
他们也不知道多少情况
There's not much they don't know.

934
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,070
你的人
Your people?

935
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,310
我现在就想把事情搞清楚
Now I'm just trying to piece together the truth,

936
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,510
到时候越过我长官  直接跟海军司令汇报
so I can take it over my commander's head to the Admiral.

937
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,000
所以他们才想干掉我  所以我才想跟帕皮说清楚
That's why they wanna kill me and why I wanted to talk to Papi.

938
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,560
好吧
Right.

939
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,320
这样的话...
Well...

940
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,840
我觉得  我们可以一起去问他个清楚
I guess we can both talk to him at the same time.

941
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,190
什么  我们现在变搭档了
What, like we're workin' together?

942
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,630
不是  我们才不是什么搭档
No, not like we're working together.

943
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,400
-那才像话  -不是  我们只是有交叉而已
-Yeah. -No, like we're workin' in the same vicinity.

944
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,550
-就是一起  -调查的地方一样
-Together. -In the same area code.

945
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,070
-那就是一起  -同一个郡而已
-Together. -The same county.

946
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,080
别拿"四海一家"套我身上啊
And don't get all "We Are The World" on me either.

947
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,060
等这事完了  我要开枪还是会开枪的
When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.

948
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:51,990
但我们现在是搭档啦
But we're partners.

949
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,670
拜托  伙计  黑键白键不分开的
Come on, man, Ebony and Ivory.

950
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,720
见鬼  我觉得他吐死了  反正不是吐了就是死了
Shit, I think he puked. He's puked or he's dead.

951
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,520
哦没错  他吐了
Oh, yeah, he puked.

952
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,000
嘿
Hey.

953
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,510
我他妈到时候整死你们两个小崽子
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you both.

954
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,830
看样子要点时间啊
This might take a while.

955
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,330
伙计  我有时候陪你耗着
I got all day, partner.

956
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,710
等等
Hold on.

957
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,640
我送个香屁给你  妥妥的收下啊
Let me put that in there with ya. Put that on ya.

958
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,480
-那...-搭档  你打算怎么来
-So... -Partner, how you wanna do this?

959
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,470
这话中听  特别是从你嘴里说出来
I like that, it's got a nice roll off your tongue there.

960
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,840
我们还没这么熟  别说得这么亲  保持距离
We're not that close. Don't kumbaya with me. Don't kumbaya.

961
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,110
我去拿水桶和毛巾  我们给这混蛋上上水刑
I'm gonna get my bucket and towel and waterboard his ass.

962
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,750
不了  我们给他个机会说清楚  你有什么要说的吗
No, we gotta give him a chance to talk. You got anything to say?

963
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,870
但愿你们喜欢卵蛋的味道
I hope you guys like the taste of balls,

964
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,280
因为到时候我会把它们割下来  塞进你们嘴里
because I'm gonna chop yours off, stuff 'em in your mouths.

965
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,430
看到没有
See?

966
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,800
也许到时候我换着塞
Or maybe I'll put yours in his and his in yours.

967
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,430
想我去拿水桶吗
Want me to get the bucket?

968
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,600
速度拿来
Kumbaya.

969
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,960
为什么你在特雷司·克鲁塞斯存了这么多钱
So why were you puttin' so much money in Tres Cruces?

970
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,880
因为那是特雷司·克鲁塞斯储贷公司
It's Tres Cruces.

971
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,890
我们以为你只存了一点钱在那里
We thought you just stashed a little cash there

972
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,850
抢劫后却发现了4千万  这怎么回事
until we robbed the place, found 40 million. Why is that?

973
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,350
你们偷了特雷司·克鲁塞斯
You robbed Tres Cruces?

974
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,790
没错  到底怎么回事
That's correct. Why is that?

975
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,160
很好笑是吧  是吗
That's funny, huh?

976
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,480
你死定了
You're dead.

977
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,550
-没错  很好笑是吧  是吧  -你俩都死定了
-Yeah, that is funny, isn't it? -You're both dead.

978
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,840
都不用我动手
And I didn't even have to kill you.

979
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,640
我还以为你是个聪明人  "很有门路"的鲍比
I thought you were sharp. "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

980
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,080
可你呢...
But you...

981
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,520
你抢的是中情局的钱
You just ripped off the CIA.

982
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,810
中情局
The CIA?

983
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,430
中情局
The CIA.

984
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,870
满嘴胡言  中情局存钱的银行  他插一脚干嘛
He's full of crap. Why would he have money in the same bank as the CIA?

985
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,990
你干嘛要把钱存在中情局存钱的银行里
Why would you have money in the same bank as the CIA?

986
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,330
那银行里  我没存一分钱
I don't have shit in that bank.

987
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,470
我在特雷司·克鲁塞斯存的唯一一笔钱
The only money I deliver to Tres Cruces

988
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,560
-是一笔付款  -付给中情局的
-is a payment. -To the CIA?

989
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,040
给中情局  他们从我收入中抽7%
The CIA. They take 7% of my revenue.

990
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,110
作为回报  他们让我用他们的飞机
In return, they let me use their planes

991
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,770
把我的货带出边境
so I can get my shit across the border.

992
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,320
我本来有更便宜的方法  可是他们说了算
I could do it a lot cheaper, but there was really no negotiations.

993
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,520
你知道吗...
You know...

994
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,720
他们收所有党派的贿赂
They take it from all the cartels.

995
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,520
胡说八道
Bullshit.

996
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,920
就算这样
Okay.

997
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,050
他们还是要干掉你俩的
They're still gonna kill you.

998
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,480
鲍比
Bobby?

999
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,000
你说  想来就来的
You said stop by anytime.

1000
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,150
-你绑架了一个大毒枭  -没错
-You kidnapped a drug kingpin! -That's correct.

1001
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,000
帕皮·格雷科  你还把他捆在我车库里
Papi Greco! And you tied him up in my garage!

1002
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,440
你介意我那个酸奶喝吗
You mind if I swipe a yogurt?

1003
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,070
没事  拿吧  想拿什么拿什么  全部拿走最好
Yeah, sure. Please. Help yourself to anything. Take whatever you want.

1004
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,270
就一罐酸奶而已
It's just a yogurt.

1005
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,800
但是她的酸奶  放回去吧
But it's her yogurt. Just put it back.

1006
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,200
求你了
Please.

1007
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,550
你们两个是前男女朋友吗
Are you two like ex-boyfriend and girlfriend?

1008
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,110
实际上  怎么说呢  我们从来没认真谈过
Actually, you know what? We never put a name on it.

1009
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,030
那结果呢  你伤他的心  还是他伤了你的心
So, what, you broke his heart or he broke yours?

1010
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,960
哇哦  这家伙真是口无遮拦  随便乱问啊
Wow, this guy will really ask anyone anything at anytime.

1011
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,870
要不你去看看帕皮的情况  好吗
Why don't you go and check on Papi, huh?

1012
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,000
你看上这男人什么了
What do you see in this guy?

1013
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,550
我可以说上好几小时  但我不认识你
I could go on for hours, but I don't know you,

1014
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,070
我也不觉得我们现在应该
and I don't think this is the right time

1015
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,600
谈论这种话题  懂了吗
for us to have this conversation, okay?

1016
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,510
所以是恋父情节啦  啊
So daddy issues, huh?

1017
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,560
老爸
Daddy!

1018
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,890
滚去车库  盯着帕皮  速度滚
Garage. Papi. Go.

1019
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,850
-我现在看明白了  -速度滚  滚去车库
-I get it now. -Go. Go to the garage.

1020
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,440
-我能拿这罐酸奶吗  -你拿去好了  拿着
-Can I have the yogurt? -You can have the yogurt. Here.

1021
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,670
-我不喜欢她  伙计  -没你的事
-I don't like her, man. -You don't get a vote.

1022
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,840
我替你盯着她
I'm gonna watch her.

1023
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,080
鲍比  你到底在干什么
Bobby. What are you doing?

1024
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,680
你完全确定  你能相信那家伙吗
Are you 100% sure you can trust this guy?

1025
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,160
不能  但他是我能找到唯一的帮手了
No. But he's all the help I got.

1026
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,040
杰瑟普死了
Jessup's dead.

1027
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,160
我们偷的是中情局的钱  他们会找上门的
The money we stole was CIA money. They came lookin' for it.

1028
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,640
对不起  黛比  我不是故意把你拖下水的
I'm sorry, Deb, I didn't mean to get you involved in all this.

1029
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,440
你没事吧
You okay?

1030
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,130
你在笑什么呢
What are you smirking at?

1031
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,310
你知道吗  我一直挖空心思
You know, I've been racking my brain

1032
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,970
想知道你长什么样子的
trying to figure out who you look like.

1033
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,690
现在我终于看清楚了
And it finally dawned on me.

1034
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,440
你就像墨西哥版的阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦
You look like a Mexican Albert Einstein.

1035
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,520
就差点他的智商  这明显的
Minus the genius factor, obviously.

1036
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,120
你要点酸奶吗
You want some yogurt?

1037
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,240
报复死你俩
Payback's a bitch.

1038
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,200
这拳替小托罗打的
That's for Little Toro.

1039
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,000
斯蒂格
Stig.

1040
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,080
斯蒂格
Stig!

1041
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,670
打包走人
Pack it up!

1042
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
这边  这边
Move it, move it!

1043
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,360
-斯蒂格  -两个人
-Stig. -The one and only.

1044
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,550
是你的人吗
That your people?

1045
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,800
你一定要这么说吗
Do you have to say it like that?

1046
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,480
怎么说了  他们是你的人  对吧
Like what? They're your people, right?

1047
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,120
严格说  是的  但现在只有你是我的人了
Technically, yes, but I thought you were my people now.

1048
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,350
好了  数两下  我们就冲进车库  数了啊
All right, two taps, we'll hit the garage. On go.

1049
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,080
-好的  你数吧  -动手
-Okay. On your go. -Go!

1050
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,280
操
Fuck.

1051
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,510
这什么情况
What was that about?

1052
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,680
那是一通乱打
That was messed up.

1053
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,990
到底什么情况
What the hell is going on?

1054
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,120
我不知道
I don't know.

1055
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,930
我也不知道
I don't know.

1056
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,680
把手机给我  快点
Give me your phone, now.

1057
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,910
车子我也要了  出来  出来
I'll take the car, too. Get out. Get out!

1058
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,960
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1059
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,920
他在辆灰色车上
Está en un gray Charger.

1060
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,960
斯蒂格的人怎么知道来你家里找我们的
How did Stig's people know to come to your house?

1061
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,350
我不知道  他们肯定是跟踪你们了
I don't know. They must have followed you.

1062
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,470
我不觉得
I don't think so.

1063
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,830
跟踪的话  我们会发现他们的
We would have seen 'em.

1064
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,840
他们肯定发现他们的
We should have seen 'em.

1065
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,840
他们怎么知道来你家的
How'd they know to come to your house?

1066
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,320
啊
Hmm?

1067
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,550
为什么他们来你家了  黛比
Why were they at your house, Debbie?

1068
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,890
不是吧  你真的假的
No. You serious?

1069
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,080
鲍比...
Bobby...

1070
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,610
出去  麻利点
Out of the car, gabacho.

1071
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,840
快点
Hurry up.

1072
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,000
你现在完了吧
You fucked up now, I see.

1073
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,720
跪下
On your knees.

1074
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,080
不止你有门路的  鲍比
I know some guys, too, Bobby.

1075
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,680
把他们绑起来  带回去再说
Bag 'em up. Let's take 'em home.

1076
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,350
-你想谈谈吗  -不用
-Do you wanna talk about it? -No.

1077
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,850
-你确定  -我确定
-You sure? -Yeah, I'm sure.

1078
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,190
我说了  我不喜欢她  伙计
I told you I didn't like her, man.

1079
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,280
闭嘴
Shut up.

1080
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,830
你干嘛对我这么态度啊
What are you gettin' mad at me for?

1081
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,150
因为你废话太多了
Because you talk too much.

1082
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,190
我对你怎么过了啊
What'd I ever do to you?

1083
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,720
除了朝我开枪吗
Besides shoot me?

1084
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,110
你知道你是什么吗  你就是费青
You know what you are? You're a misanthorpe.

1085
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,790
是愤青  我也是个费青
It's misanthrope. I'm a misanthrope.

1086
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,030
你知道我说的哪个词吗
Did you know what I meant to say?

1087
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,590
不知道  你想说哪个
No. What did you mean to say?

1088
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,440
-就是你看谁都不顺眼  -闭嘴
-That you don't like people. -Shut up.

1089
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,230
该我松松筋骨了
Time for my massage.

1090
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,080
我会替你收拾床的
Yeah. I'll have housekeeping clean up your bed.

1091
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,680
靠
Oh, shit.

1092
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,750
我爷爷砍了三十年甘蔗  手上从来没出过一个水泡
My grandfather cut cane for 30 years every day and never got a blister.

1093
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,920
太难闻了
Says it smells like hell,

1094
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,200
不过能让手变得坚韧
toughens the hands.

1095
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,990
知道现在我最喜欢什么
You know what I like about this?

1096
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,200
我不光能和你俩待在一起
Not only do I get to take my time with you guys,

1097
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,960
而且这次不必再担心留下把柄
but this time, I don't have to worry about leaving any marks.

1098
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,960
别用你的手碰我
Don't put your hands on me, man.

1099
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
-靠  -你说什么
-Shit. -What did you say?

1100
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,920
别拿你那脏手碰我
Just don't put those pissy hands on me, man.

1101
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,680
你无家可归了  鲍比
You ain't got a home, Bobby.

1102
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,430
缉毒局不再需要你
DEA doesn't want you around.

1103
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,600
因为你犯了罪
Not with your sins.

1104
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,110
我到时候报复死你
Payback's a bitch.

1105
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,080
你闻起来像臭虫  伙计
You smell like warm Corona, man.

1106
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,520
还记得我的牛吧
You remember my prize breeding bull.

1107
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,680
它的蛋和椰子一样大
With cojones the size of coconuts.

1108
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,280
想见见不
You wanna see him?

1109
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,010
不用了  我们在这看就挺好的
No, it's okay. We can see good from here.

1110
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,450
拜拜  鲍比
Adiós, Bobby.

1111
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,720
别
No, no.

1112
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,520
靠
Shit!

1113
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,960
4300万美元
43 million!

1114
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,590
我们就从CIA那偷了这么多
It's everything we stole from the CIA.

1115
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,310
放了我们  我们把钱给你
You let us go, we'll bring it to you.

1116
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,320
钱在我这
I got the money.

1117
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,030
-你说啥  -钱在我这
-What are you talking about? -I got it.

1118
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,190
-钱不在你这  -我当然知道  可他不知道
-You don't have it! -I know I don't have it. He doesn't know that.

1119
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,390
可钱不在你手里
But you don't have the money.

1120
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,070
我知道钱不在你那  因为在我这
I know you don't have it, 'cause I have it.

1121
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,190
在你那  哪儿
You have it? Well, where is it?

1122
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,160
昆西司令的保险箱里
Commander Quince's safe.

1123
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,710
库帕斯克里斯蒂市海军航空基地
Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.

1124
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,560
别跟我说  跟他说
Don't tell me. Tell him.

1125
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,480
靠
Oh, shit!

1126
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,800
钱在哪
Where is it?

1127
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,520
在库帕斯克里斯蒂市海军航空基地昆西司令的保险柜里
Commander Quince's safe! Corpus Christi Naval Air Station!

1128
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,350
他就这么侮辱我们  你居然还问要不要告诉他
The guy's pissing on us, and you're askin' if we should fuckin' tell him.

1129
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,400
就算你说的是真的  没准我现在也弄死你们
If that's the truth, I might as well just kill you now.

1130
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,880
把我女儿带到别的房间去

1131
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,040
我正在追查两个从你那出来的家伙
I had a run-in with a couple boys out of your organization.

1132
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
你好啊  厄尔
Hello, Earl.

1133
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,840
鲍比·宾斯先生和迈克尔·斯蒂格曼先生
Mr. Bobby Beans and Mr. Michael Stigman.

1134
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,080
他们不是我的人
Well, they're not from my organization.

1135
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,000
他们自己单干
They're freelancers.

1136
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,880
鲍比·宾斯是缉毒局的间谍
And Bobby Beans is undercover DEA.

1137
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,960
斯蒂格曼先生是擅离职守的美国海军
And Mr. Stigman's AWOL U.S. Navy.

1138
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,750
他们从特雷司·克鲁塞斯储贷公司偷了4312.5万美元
They stole 43.125 million from the Tres Cruces.

1139
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,230
我们想要回来
We want it back.

1140
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,710
我有什么好处
Is there a finder's fee?

1141
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,510
我们继续让你做生意
Fee is we let you continue to do business.

1142
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,200
我们不会把费用从7%提升到20%
Fee is we don't raise our cut from 7% to 20.

1143
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,290
我们也不会派一支阿帕奇A-6直升机小队
The fee is we don't come down here

1144
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,670
来把你炸的渣都不剩
with a squad of Apache A-6 helicopters

1145
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,400
这就是你的好处
and wipe you off the face of the earth.

1146
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,040
你希望我的国家脆弱而堕落
You like my country weak and corrupt, don't you?

1147
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,360
所以你能在商场里买到便宜的垃圾
So you can buy your cheap crap at the mall.

1148
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,920
不过  厄尔  我可不便宜
Well, Earl, I'm not cheap.

1149
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,040
你在跟我玩傲气吗
Is this about pride, Manny?

1150
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,470
彰显男子气概吗
About machismo?

1151
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,720
想要证明你有个巨大的墨西哥屌
Prove you got a big Mexican cock?

1152
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,070
不得不说  你的屌确实大
Well, your cock is huge. It's massive.

1153
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,080
而且我很敬畏
And I, I'm in awe of your cock.

1154
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,880
可那又如何  你还不是个毒贩
So what? You're still a drug dealer.

1155
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,200
而我依旧是美国政府的一员
And I'm still the government of the United States.

1156
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,570
市场是自由的  曼尼
It's a free market, Manny.

1157
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,880
可并不是全世界都如此
Not a free world.

1158
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,150
我会想想看
I'll take a look.

1159
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,280
你会很为难的
Hard! You'll look hard.

1160
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,290
在墨西哥混向来如此
Under every rock in Mexico.

1161
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,960
离开这鬼地方
Let's get out of this shithole.

1162
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,760
把鸡笼里那俩蠢货放了

1163
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,500
如果那白人确实是美国海军  我们没准能赚4300万美元

1164
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,340
那你中情局的朋友怎么办

1165
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,660
让他回家吃屎去吧

1166
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,360
我喜欢这个  老大

1167
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,160
我决定让你们去给我带回那4300万美元
I've decided to let you bring me the 43 million.

1168
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,390
卡车会带你们向北到边境
The truck'll take you north to the border.

1169
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,430
到那以后  你们就得和偷渡者们一起步行穿越国境
From there, you'll cross on foot with the coyotes.

1170
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,720
如果一直是这样的话  我们愿意来开车
If it's all the same, we'd rather drive.

1171
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,870
现在人人都在找你们
With everybody lookin' for you,

1172
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,270
如果开车  他们会在两秒内把你干掉
they'd pull you out of line in two seconds.

1173
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,610
所以你们得步行  像我们的人民被迫偷渡一样
No, you go the way you force my people.

1174
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,110
如果我们不能冒险穿过边境
If we can't risk crossing,

1175
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,350
我们怎么把钱给你带回来
how are we supposed to bring you back the money?

1176
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,600
我在北边境等你们24小时
I'll meet you north of the border in 24 hours.

1177
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,640
现在  我相信你们不会再讨价还价了
Now, I'm trusting you to fulfill your part of the bargain.

1178
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,200
喂  鲍比
Hey, Bobby.

1179
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,570
你有24小时把钱给我带来
You got 24 hours to bring me the money.

1180
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,520
否则我会在她脑袋上开个洞
Or I'm gonna shoot her right in the head.

1181
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,590
然后我会找到你
Then I'm gonna find you,

1182
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,760
把你像猪一样开膛破肚
and I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

1183
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,920
斯蒂格
Stig!

1184
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,360
这些都结束以后  我还是会一枪崩了你
When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.

1185
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,240
尽管来  鲍比
Whatever it takes, Bobby.

1186
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,470
随便挑一辆  我都能弄来
Pick one. I can get in anything.

1187
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,870
那辆奥迪怎么样
So, what about the Audi?

1188
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,790
不  德国车可不行  锁太复杂  各种警报
No, I don't do German, okay? Locks are tricky, too many alarms.

1189
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,320
好吧  雪佛兰厢车怎么样
Okay. Suburban?

1190
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,630
那是2010款
That one's 2010.

1191
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,880
2英里耗一加仑油  我可不想付那么多油钱
It's gonna get like two miles a gallon. I ain't payin' for all that gas.

1192
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,760
作为一个偷车贼  你还真是挑剔
For a car thief, you are mighty particular.

1193
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,120
我准备弄那辆本田
I'll break into the Honda.

1194
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,750
你看我能和你挤进一辆本田吗
I look like I'm gonna ride in that Honda to you?

1195
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,910
你可以的
You could.

1196
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,550
那你应该选一辆经典的
And you could pick somethin' with a little more class.

1197
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,950
不是我多嘴  我们要闯的可是
I hate to remind you, but we're breakin'

1198
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,230
高度戒备的海军基地
onto a high-security Navy base.

1199
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,470
不是嘻哈剧院
We ain't goin' to the hip-hop opera.

1200
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,150
今晚可没有悲惨世界给你看
It ain't no Les Misérables for you tonight.

1201
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,160
悲惨世界
Les Misérables!

1202
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,390
随便
Oh, man, whatever the fuck, man.

1203
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,470
不用提醒我
Don't remind me.

1204
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,150
昆西把钱带到基地可不是我的错
Look, it's not my fault Quince took the money back to the base.

1205
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,790
我以为是你把钱带回基地
I thought you said you took the money back to the base.

1206
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,160
我从没说过
No, I never said that.

1207
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,750
那钱有可能在任何地方
So the money could be anywhere.

1208
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,670
可能在东加毕普  在开曼岛
It could be in East Jabip, the Cayman Islands...

1209
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,150
不  钱就在基地  好吗
No, the money is on the base, okay?

1210
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,990
我在卡米诺瑞尔把钱给了昆西司令
I gave it to Commander Quince at the Camino Real,

1211
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,510
然后他让那哥们把钱带回基地
and he told the guys to take it back to the base.

1212
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,640
然后他就想弄死你
Right before he took you out and tried to kill you.

1213
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,190
那不代表把钱藏基地是故意骗我的
That doesn't mean he's lyin' about the base.

1214
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,350
不是所有人都和你一样偏执  鲍比
Not everybody's as paranoid as you, Bobby. Jeez.

1215
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,680
那辆普锐斯怎么样  你喜欢不
What about the Prius? You like the Prius?

1216
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,800
卡米诺瑞尔
Camino Real.

1217
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,160
没错  是个酒店
Yeah, it's a hotel.

1218
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,470
我在卡米诺瑞尔遇见了黛比
I met Debbie at the Camino Real.

1219
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,480
真的假的
No shit?

1220
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,840
-真的  -她在那干嘛
-Yeah. -What was she doin' there?

1221
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,040
她说她去那看她男友哈维
She said she was there to meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

1222
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,190
等等  你的女朋友还有个男友
Wait. Your girlfriend has a boyfriend?

1223
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,530
她不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

1224
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,600
我的天
Holy shit.

1225
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,560
赶紧挑辆车吧
Yeah, just pick a car.

1226
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,480
就它了
Right here.

1227
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,280
就这个
You picked that one?

1228
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,400
没错
Yeah.

1229
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,800
你还想要啥  宾利
Fuck you want, a fuckin' Bentley?

1230
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,400
我来吧
I got it.

1231
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,480
-你好  -你好
-Hi. -Hey.

1232
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,930
有个问题
Crazy question,

1233
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,850
你这有人能修雪地摩托吗
you wouldn't have anybody knows how to fix a snowmobile?

1234
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
貌似没有
I don't think so.

1235
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,510
能不能帮我查一下  今晚之前就得修好
Would you check for me? I really need it fixed by tonight.

1236
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,930
怎么  有暴风雪要来
Why, a big storm coming?

1237
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,960
谁都不确定它不会来
You never can be too sure.

1238
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,240
我去去就来
I'll be right back.

1239
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,520
-你咋了  -什么咋了
-Up with that? -What?

1240
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,640
她冲你笑  你居然没冲她挤眼睛
She smiled at you, you didn't wink at her?

1241
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,720
我可不会冲每一个我看见的女人抛媚眼
I don't wink at every woman I see.

1242
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,480
德克萨斯的雪地摩托  看来你要动真格的了
Snowmobile in Texas, huh? You must be in some serious shit, sailor.

1243
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,000
你给自己弄了个新爪子
You got yourself a new claw, huh?

1244
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,240
-来碰个拳  -挺好看
-Gimme claw. Give it a pound. -It's a beaut.

1245
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,160
你这还有我的应急储备吗
You still got my rainy-day stash?

1246
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,440
当然
Yeah.

1247
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,770
回见  斯蒂格
See ya later, Stig.

1248
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,040
好的
All right.

1249
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,270
知道人们怎么说吗
You know what they say,

1250
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:37,430
小声说话然后带上M-4和榴弹发射器
talk softly and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

1251
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,720
喔
Wow.

1252
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,450
你要哪个
Which one you want?

1253
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,880
这个
This one.

1254
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,720
你有进入基地的计划了吗
What's your plan for gettin' on the base?

1255
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,080
正在想
I'm workin' on it.

1256
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,590
记住  我们到了指挥楼以后
Remember, once we get to the command building,

1257
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,270
昆西的办公室在一楼走廊的最后
Quince's office is first floor, end of the hall.

1258
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,430
如果他不在训练场的话  他每天在那住18小时
If he's not in the field, that's where he lives 18 hours a day.

1259
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,880
好的  可你还没告诉我
Right, right. But you still haven't told me

1260
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,630
你有什么计划能让咱穿过这道门
what the plan is to get through the gate.

1261
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,160
我有计划  我是说  我肯定能想到计划
I got a plan. I mean, I'm capable of comin' up with a plan.

1262
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,350
我可没说你想不到
I'm not sayin' you're not capable,

1263
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,770
我是说你还没告诉我  到底是什么
I'm just sayin' you haven't told me. What is it?

1264
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,370
我在想
I'm workin' on it.

1265
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,840
最好想快点
Better work faster.

1266
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,080
再快点
Much faster.

1267
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,310
往前  快点
Move it up. Quickly.

1268
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,320
靠
Fuck it.

1269
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,920
停下
Halt!

1270
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,490
他要闯进去
He's going through!

1271
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,840
这够快了不
That fast enough for ya?

1272
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,080
靠
Shit!

1273
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,240
我们上  电台联系
Let's go! Let's go! On the radio now!

1274
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,480
回标杆那去
Return to post!

1275
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,110
这就是你的计划
That was your plan?

1276
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,310
反正我们已经进来了
Well, we're on the base, aren't we?

1277
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,270
这不能叫计划  脑子正常的人都不会闯进一个海军基地
That's not a plan. Nobody in their right mind breaks into a naval base.

1278
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,030
这就是计划的高明之处  没人能预料到
That's why it's a brilliant plan. No one expected it.

1279
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,070
你应该看看你的表情  他们都和你一样震惊了
You shoulda seen your face. Damn, they were surprised.

1280
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,710
你等会下车  我来当诱饵把他们引开
Your stop comin' up. I'll play decoy,

1281
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,310
然后去找上将  怎么样
lead 'em away, try to get to the Admiral, okay?

1282
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,920
好的  如果出了问题  我们在船坞的院子里见
All right. Things go wrong, I'll see you back at the boat yard.

1283
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,200
不会出问题的
Things ain't goin' wrong.

1284
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,520
我可以的  我去找上将  我能行  看好
I'm gettin' a medal. I get to the Admiral, I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

1285
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,120
你会祝我好运的对吧
You're gonna wish me luck, aren't ya?

1286
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,790
-说啊  -祝你好运
-Come on, man, let's hear it! -Good luck.

1287
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,390
昆西的办公室在走廊尽头
Quince's office at the end of the hall.

1288
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,720
记住  一楼  走廊尽头
Remember, first floor, end of the hall!

1289
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,320
停下  不许动
Halt! Stop where you are!

1290
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,070
指挥楼有情况
We have a breach at Status Hall!

1291
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,120
快
Go, go, go, go!

1292
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,880
上楼
Up the stairs!

1293
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,040
长官  士官迈克尔·斯蒂格曼报道  ID号540333
Sir, Petty Officer Michael Stigman, ID number 540333.

1294
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,560
等等  出什么问题了
Wait a minute, what's the problem?

1295
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,960
对不住  我也不想这么做的
Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that to you, man.

1296
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,800
长官
Sir.

1297
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,320
我服役12年
I've been in service 12 years.

1298
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,630
从来没有踏进过长官食堂  更别提闯进来了
I've never stepped foot in an officers' mess, much less crashed it.

1299
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,130
真的  长官  紧急情况
Please, sir, it's an emergency.

1300
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,320
去外边等着
Stand outside, please.

1301
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,360
-都出去吧  -谢谢  长官
-Leave us alone. -Thank you, sir.

1302
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,910
真对不住
Hey, I'm really sorry about that, man.

1303
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,230
我确实没想打你来着  我道歉
I didn't mean to hit you like that. I apologize.

1304
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,590
说吧  士官  坐
I'm listening, sailor. Sit.

1305
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,800
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

1306
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,040
-接着帮我拨将军的电话  -是  长官
-Try the Admiral again for me. -Yes, sir.

1307
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,910
你相信这些偷出来的钱
And you believed this stolen money

1308
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,840
可被用来打击毒品团伙
would all be used to fight drug cartels?

1309
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,730
是的  长官  我认为结果取决于有效的指挥
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came down the valid chain of command.

1310
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,760
愚忠非忠
Blind loyalty is not loyalty.

1311
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,600
我明白  长官  这就是我来这的原因
I know that, sir, and that's why I'm here.

1312
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,790
你能到这来告诉我这个说明你胆子很大
Well, you've shown a lot of tenacity

1313
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,450
也很有韧性  
and a lot of guts bringing this to me.

1314
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,800
谢谢  长官  因为您能挽救这一切
Thank you, sir. That means the world comin' from you.

1315
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,530
不幸的是对这事我无能为力
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you.

1316
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,950
当然可以  长官  您只需关闭基地
Of course, sir. I mean, you can just lock down the base.

1317
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,200
可以逮捕昆西司令
You can arrest Commander Quince.

1318
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,200
美国海军不会抢银行
The United States Navy does not rob banks.

1319
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,360
我们的人从来没有抢过银行
Its personnel did not rob a bank.

1320
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,160
我不会因为一个坏士兵而玷污美国海军的正直形象
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1321
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,990
如果银行丢了钱
If there was money taken from the bank

1322
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,970
那肯定是不合法的中情局的破基金的钱
that was part of an illegal CIA slush fund,

1323
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,600
而海军根本就不知道这个基金的存在
the Navy had no knowledge the fund existed.

1324
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,030
你的档案还是六个月的擅离职守
Your jacket has you six months AWOL?

1325
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,040
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

1326
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,120
那它一直都会这样了
It's gonna stay that way.

1327
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,410
昆西司令的档案也会被修改成擅离职守
Commander Quince's jacket will likewise be amended so he's also AWOL,

1328
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,840
这样就不会是海军的问题了
making none of this the Navy's problem.

1329
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,200
长官  这么做不对
Sir, this isn't right.

1330
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,040
我可以提供更多
Well, I'd offer more,

1331
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,670
但是当手臂已经坏疽
but when the hand has gangrene,

1332
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,680
断臂才能活命
you chop it off to save the body.

1333
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:48,330
你不能因为它本来是好的就一直留着
You don't keep the pinkie around just because it meant well.

1334
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,720
把士官斯蒂格曼请出大门外边去
Have Petty Officer Stigman dropped outside the main gate.

1335
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,810
要是他再走进世界上任何一个军事基地
He sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world,

1336
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,530
毙了他
I want him shot.

1337
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,870
全是扯淡
This is bullshit.

1338
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,200
士兵听从你这样的人的命令去战斗至死
You know, men like me fight and die on the orders of men like you!

1339
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,200
没有我们  你肩膀上的星星就是戏服
Without us, those stars on your shoulder are a fucking costume!

1340
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,920
打开保险箱
Open the safe.

1341
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,070
你老大知道你在这吗
Does your boss know you're doin' this?

1342
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,190
打开
Open it.

1343
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,520
还是中情局把她杀了  就像他们杀了杰瑟普
Or did the CIA kill her like they did Jessup?

1344
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,790
和你有什么关系
What's it to you?

1345
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,880
我不喜欢模糊的结局
I don't like loose ends.

1346
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,040
我也不喜欢
Neither do I...

1347
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,400
哈维
Harvey.

1348
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,480
是吧
Huh?

1349
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,000
我妈叫我霍华德
Well, my mother named me Harold.

1350
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,600
我觉得哈维更好听  
I like Harvey. Harvey has a nice ring to it.

1351
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,530
你不喜欢哈维
Don't you like Harvey?

1352
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,240
-我不知道你在说什么  -你当然知道
-I don't know what you're talkin' about. -Yes, you do.

1353
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,640
最近去过卡米诺瑞尔酒店吧
Been to the Camino Real Hotel lately?

1354
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,920
打开保险箱
Open the safe.

1355
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,950
集结地已就绪
Staging area cleared up!

1356
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,080
可以通过
Bring it through!

1357
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,200
钱在哪
Where's the money?

1358
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,730
你先告诉我黛比在哪
You tell me where Deb is.

1359
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,520
她在做指甲  钱在哪
She's gettin' her nails done. Where is the money?

1360
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,000
我不知道
I don't know.

1361
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,880
好了  现在告诉我你所做的
All right, tell me what you do know.

1362
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,590
你女朋友和我
Well, your girl found out where the CIA

1363
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,910
同时发现了中情局藏钱的地方
was stashing the money right about when I did.

1364
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,310
当我告诉她
And when I told her

1365
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,590
我俩可以陷害你和斯蒂格曼然后带着钱远走高飞的时候
that she and I could get away with the money by setting you and Stigman up,

1366
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,720
她连眼睛都没眨一下
she didn't even blink.

1367
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,510
别骗我
Don't lie to me.

1368
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,680
她和你在一起就那么不开心
Was she that unhappy, Bobby?

1369
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,720
钱在哪  别骗我
Where is the money? Don't lie to me.

1370
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,650
你和斯蒂格曼还活着  你觉得我会把钱放这
You think I'd keep it here with you and Stigman still alive?

1371
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,280
别傻了  鲍比
Come on, Bobby.

1372
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,840
你把钱给她了  是吗
You gave it to her, didn't you?

1373
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,840
是吗
Didn't you?

1374
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,440
将军  向后退
Commander. Back up.

1375
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,970
-快快快  -在你们六点钟方向
-Go, go, go, go! -On your six!

1376
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,570
快  快  快
Move, move, move!

1377
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,880
所有人员从大厦内撤离
All personnel evacuate the building.

1378
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,240
所有人员从大厦内撤离
All personnel evacuate the building.

1379
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,070
看住后门  在草丛里
Take the back, in that alley!

1380
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,520
去前门  我们走
Go to the front! Let's go!

1381
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,110
闪开点
Hey!

1382
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,770
这边  行动
This way! Move!

1383
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,880
快点  跟上  我们得找到他
Come on, come on! Find him!

1384
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,920
没有发现
Clear!

1385
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,640
没有发现
Clear!

1386
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,720
你还好吗
You Okay?

1387
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,370
快点起来  我们走
Come on, let's go.

1388
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,360
还好吗  先生  是的  我没事
You okay, sir? Yeah, I'm fine.

1389
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,080
他从下水管逃走了
Work off the standpipe!

1390
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,080
这烧烤做的真不错
This is really good barbecue.

1391
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,320
你肯定想尝尝吧
You don't want to regret not tryin' it.

1392
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,040
为什么你还在这浪费时间不直接杀了我呢
Why don't you stop wasting my time and just kill me?

1393
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,880
就算鲍比带着钱来了
Even if Bobby was coming with the money,

1394
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,960
你还是会把我们都杀了吧
you'd still kill us both.

1395
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,680
但是他不会来了
But he's not coming.

1396
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,160
-他会来的  -不会了
-He'll be here. -No.

1397
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,280
他不会来了
He won't.

1398
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,320
你觉得他会不管你死活吗
You think he's just gonna let you die?

1399
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,200
你觉得海军跑到我家来找鲍比是巧合吗
You think it was a coincidence the Navy came looking for Bobby at my house?

1400
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,120
如果不是鲍比  至少我已经拿到4300万的一半
If I couldn't have Bobby, at least I'd have half of 43 million.

1401
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,600
是你给鲍比·宾斯下的套
You set up Bobby Beans.

1402
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,080
不然我也不会来找你的
I wouldn't be coming for you either.

1403
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,720
钱在哪里
Where's the money?

1404
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,000
别傻了  我也不知道
Come on. I don't know.

1405
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,730
钱已经汇到国外了
Gone, outta the country.

1406
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,360
肯定不在海军总部  帕皮
It's certainly not on a Navy base, Papi.

1407
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,400
那里都给了你什么
Where does that leave you?

1408
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,360
给了我应得的
Exactly where I deserve to be.

1409
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,200
-是我  -鲍比
-Yeah. -Bobby.

1410
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,570
你迟到了
You're late.

1411
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,160
我拿到钱了
I got the money.

1412
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,040
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

1413
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,240
我这次真的拿到了
No, I got it.

1414
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,400
相信我  我真的拿到钱了  我这就拿来给你
Believe me, I got it. I'll bring it to you.

1415
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,970
你在哪里
Where are you?

1416
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,890
嗨  鲍比
Hi, Bobby.

1417
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,320
黛比
Debbie?

1418
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,200
他能听到我们说话吗
Can he hear us?

1419
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,520
挂了电话快逃
Just hang up the phone and run.

1420
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,040
好的  听我说
Okay, listen to me.

1421
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,040
告诉他我拿到钱了
Tell him I got the money.

1422
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,570
快挂电话
Hang up the phone.

1423
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,590
不是你的错  只是...
It's not your fault. Just...

1424
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,600
黛比
Debbie.

1425
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,720
告诉他我拿到钱了  好吗
Tell him I have the money. Okay?

1426
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,760
而且我知道钱在哪里
And I know you know where the money is.

1427
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,360
一定要告诉他我拿到了
Just tell him I have it.

1428
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,480
黛比  听我说
Debbie, listen to me.

1429
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,130
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1430
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,000
我真的很爱你
I really meant to love you.

1431
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,440
黛比
Debbie.

1432
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,610
黛比  你在哪儿  黛比  你在哪
Where are you? Debbie, where are you?

1433
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,400
黛比告诉我你在哪儿
Where are you? Debbie?

1434
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,920
你还在听吗
Hello?

1435
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,400
还在吗
Hello?

1436
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,840
还在吗
Hello?

1437
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,800
黛比  听我说  嗯...
Hello? Debbie? Uh...

1438
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,480
再等一分钟  我拿到钱了
Wait a minute, I got the money.

1439
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,190
他们怎么说  海军上将怎么说
What'd they say? What'd the Admiral say?

1440
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,110
上将能怎么说  上将已经把自己撇的干干净净了  
What'd the Admiral say? Admiral washed his hands of the whole thing.

1441
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,430
海军完全坐视不理
Navy turned their back.

1442
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,680
那钱呢
Where's the money?

1443
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,670
没有钱了  斯蒂格
There was no money, Stig.

1444
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,470
什么  没钱了
What? There was no money.

1445
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,830
当然有钱  我把钱给了昆西
'Course there is. I gave Quince the money.

1446
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,520
是的  然后昆西给了黛比  现在黛比死了
Right, and Quince gave it to Deb, and Deb is dead.

1447
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,200
帕皮杀了他
Papi killed her.

1448
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,830
狗日的
Fuck him.

1449
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,470
那我们一起去墨西哥
Let's go down to Mexico.

1450
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,240
我们要把他们一个个揪出来  然后把他们全干掉
We'll lure 'em all down, then take every one of 'em out. Kill 'em all.

1451
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,800
然后呢
And then what?

1452
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,350
至少要干掉昆西和帕皮
Well, at least Quince and Papi'd be dead.

1453
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,670
再然后呢
And then what?

1454
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,990
你想让他们逍遥法外吗
Oh, you just wanna let 'em skate?

1455
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,030
是你不明白吧  斯蒂格
You don't get it, do ya, Stig?

1456
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,590
上帝啊  你还按自己直觉行事吗
I mean, God bless you, you still think there's some kinda code.

1457
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,190
根本就没有直觉
There is no code.

1458
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,230
你只是遵循着海军给你的每个命令  他们耍得你团团转
You followed every order the Navy gave you, they kicked you in the teeth.

1459
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,550
根本就没有什么直觉  斯蒂格
There is no code, Stig.

1460
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,390
没人为了海军拼命  懂吗  根本就不关海军的事
No one fights for the Navy, okay? It's not about the Navy.

1461
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,440
你是为了身边的伙伴而拼命
You fight for the guy that's fighting next to you.

1462
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,550
这对你来说没有意义吗
That doesn't mean anything to you?

1463
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,320
我要去墨西哥了
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1464
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,990
还有你知道吗  我的直觉救了你的命
And just so you know, my code saved your life.

1465
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,710
在你心脏和肩膀之间三英尺的地方
There's three inches between your heart and your shoulder.

1466
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,720
我的子弹如果再左偏三英尺  你早死了
My bullet goes three inches left, you'd be dead.

1467
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,910
我也不会在这里
And I wouldn't be here.

1468
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,400
昆西要杀了我  因为我让你活了下来
'Cause Quince only decided to kill me because I let you live.

1469
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,270
你以为我当时是失手吗
What, you think I missed, huh?

1470
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,480
你是这样想的吗  你以为是我失手了
Is that what you think? You think I missed?

1471
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,000
你什么时候见我失手过
When have you ever seen me miss?

1472
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,840
你就呆在这儿吧  我要去墨西哥了
You stay here. I'm goin' to Mexico.

1473
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,160
我们的约定还有效吗
Our deal still stand?

1474
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,120
我给你钱  你帮我跑路
I give you the money, I walk away clean?

1475
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,070
好热闹  看起来你早上起的很早啊
Hola. Looks like you had a banner morning.

1476
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,680
你最好弄到钱了
You better have my money.

1477
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,360
就在这里  一个子不差
Right here. Every penny.

1478
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,230
鲍比在哪里
Where's Bobby?

1479
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,390
我们两分道扬镳了
We had a philosophical fallin' out.

1480
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,970
把你的后箱打开
Open your trunk.

1481
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,640
我只是想要你一句话还有你的兄弟们
I just want your word that you and your boys,

1482
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,030
费雷·诺斯·胡里奥  他们所有人
Ferret Nose Julio, all of 'em,

1483
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,480
你们都要帮我干掉昆西司令
you'll help me kill Commander Quince.

1484
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,160
谁是昆西司令
Who's Commander Quince?

1485
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,160
那就是他
That's him.

1486
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,430
斯蒂格曼先生  你承诺给我四千三百万
Mr. Stigman, you promised me $43 million

1487
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,110
如果我杀了这里的所有人
for killin' everyone on this ranch.

1488
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,120
你的钱就在这里  先生
Got the money right here, sir.

1489
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,310
问题是  我也承诺了给帕皮四千三百万
Thing is, I promised Papi the $43 million, too,

1490
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,070
所以恐怕你们二位要自己解决问题了
so I'm afraid you two are gonna have to duke it out.

1491
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,670
也许我们会先杀了你然后把这笔钱分了
Maybe he and I'll just kill you instead and split the money.

1492
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,720
你觉得怎么样  帕皮
What do you say, Papi?

1493
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,710
一个人两百万
50% of 40 million?

1494
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,480
总比死了好  不是吗
Better than 100% dead, right?

1495
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,410
他肯定是在唬你  等你一转身  马上干掉你
He'll double-cross you. Minute your back is turned, bullet in the head.

1496
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,010
五五分账
50-50.

1497
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,230
楼顶上的说要四六分
The guy up on the roof says 60-40.

1498
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,240
他的话没一句准信
He ain't got a trustworthy bone in his body.

1499
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,960
他说要干掉我  我不又回来了
I came back, didn't I?

1500
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,360
狗日的中情局
Fuckin' CIA.

1501
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,880
好热闹  好热闹
Red rover, red rover.

1502
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:02,990
哪位仁兄拿了我的4312.5万块  快给我交回来
Whoever's got my 43.125 million better come the fuck on out.

1503
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,570
你也叫他来收钱了
You offer him the money, too?

1504
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,830
我可没叫上他
I didn't call him.

1505
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,250
钱在后车厢里
It's in the trunk!

1506
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,880
你干嘛把钱在哪儿告诉他
Why the fuck did you tell him that?

1507
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,640
多谢你  指挥官
Thank you, Commander.

1508
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,870
斯蒂格曼先生  快给我把后车厢打开
Mr. Stigman, come on out and open the trunk.

1509
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,450
慢慢的来哦
Nice and slow, now.

1510
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,880
看来我们又有新客人了
Well, what do we got here?

1511
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,720
听起来好像一个墨西哥婚礼哦
Sounds like a Mexican wedding.

1512
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,920
这不是我的64年雪佛兰
Is that my '64 Impala?

1513
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,840
正是
That's correct.

1514
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,120
我告诉过你
I told you.

1515
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,710
我门路广着呢
I know a guy.

1516
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,760
现在
Now,

1517
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,280
谁想看看四千三百万现金
who wants to see $43 million?

1518
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,280
终于出现了  你可是让我找得好苦啊
For a minute there, I thought you had me chasing my tail.

1519
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,520
你想数数吗
You want to count it?

1520
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,110
你如果想耍花招  我绝对能找到你
If you're shortin' me, I know where to find you.

1521
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,390
所以我们没事了咯
So we're good?

1522
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,630
我不是跟你说过了吗
Did I not give you my word?

1523
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,640
是的没错
That's right.

1524
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,640
那就别像个傻子一样对我
Then don't treat me like an asshole.

1525
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,000
我尽力
I'll try my best.

1526
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,270
你和斯蒂格曼先生可以走了
You and Mr. Stigman are free to go.

1527
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,390
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

1528
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,070
我相信你们能找到回家的路吧
I trust you can find your own way home?

1529
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,110
肯定的
That's right.

1530
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,550
-你在干什么  鲍比  -我们走
-What're you doing, Bobby? -Let's go.

1531
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,190
我不能让他们拿走那笔钱
I'm not gonna let him get away with the money.

1532
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,590
我们走  我恨那些走狗
Let's go. I hate these daggone teeth.

1533
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,750
他们不会这样放我们走的
They're not just gonna let us go.

1534
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,550
-我心里有数  -嘿  我都带了我的M-16
-I got a plan. -Hey, I got my M-16.

1535
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,990
我还带了榴弹发射器和M-4  我们为什么不和他们干
I got my grenade launcher, I got my M-4. Let's do this shit.

1536
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,310
我自有安排  我来这里怎么会没有准备
I got a plan. I'm capable of coming up with a plan.

1537
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,590
好吧  最好别让我失望
Well, it better be a goddamn good one.

1538
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,750
你肯定会喜欢的
It's a good plan.

1539
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,960
要下雨咯
Make it rain.

1540
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,350
这就是你的计划  炸飞四千三百万前进
That was your plan? To blow up $43 million?

1541
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,830
是的  这就是我计划的高明之处  没人料得到
Yeah, that's why it's a brilliant plan. Nobody expected it.

1542
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,400
快走
Go.

1543
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,360
快点  跟上
Come on, move it!

1544
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,160
该死  快走
Dumb assholes! Move it!

1545
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,920
你不来
You comin'?

1546
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,240
当然来  我就在后面跟着你
Go ahead, I'll be right behind you.

1547
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,390
别打飞了
Don't miss.

1548
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,730
我从来不会失手
I never miss!

1549
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,400
我就说吧
Told ya.

1550
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,240
斯蒂格  斯蒂格
Stig! Stig!

1551
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,910
别动手  别动手
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1552
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,920
游戏时间结束了
Playtime's over.

1553
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,240
别再跟我兜圈子了
No more fucking around.

1554
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,480
现在
Now,

1555
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,320
丢掉你的武器
drop your weapon.

1556
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,790
让斯蒂格曼也照做
Tell Mr. Stigman to do the same.

1557
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,960
你跟他说吧
You tell him.

1558
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,310
现在很清楚
It's real simple.

1559
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,840
要么我们都放下枪要么我们都去死
We can all make a deal or we can all die.

1560
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,510
我可不想这样
I'm not making any deals.

1561
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,310
和你的人好好说说  鲍比
Talk to your man, Bobby.

1562
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,750
别犯傻
Be the smart one.

1563
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,630
你觉得特雷司·克鲁塞斯是我们唯一存钱的地方吗
You think Tres Cruces is the only stash we got?

1564
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,230
我们有20多处金库  倒处都是钱
We got 20 more. We got money everywhere.

1565
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,910
你什么都改变不了
You're not gonna change a damn thing.

1566
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,920
斯蒂格
Stig?

1567
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,400
怎么说
Yeah?

1568
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,160
你是我的人  对吗
You're my people, right?

1569
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,960
那是当然
That's correct.

1570
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,880
你还好吗
You good?

1571
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,130
没法更好了
Never better.

1572
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,350
我们不是一般人  所以
We're not people, though.

1573
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,640
所以我们是一家人
This makes us family.

1574
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,850
好的  兄弟
All right, brother.

1575
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,790
嘿  墨西哥爱因斯坦
Hey, se?or Einstein,

1576
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,230
你看起来状况很糟糕哦  老兄
you're looking kind of fucked up sittin' there, man.

1577
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,240
你们还好吗
You all right?

1578
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,280
帮我好好割草
Mow my lawn.

1579
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,950
你知道什么事情超酷吗
Well, you know what was so cool?

1580
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,910
你开着64年的雪佛兰进来真是太棒了
You rolling in on that '64 Impala.

1581
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,510
你看起来就是坏小子一个哦
I mean, you looked badass, man.

1582
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,750
那是肯定的
Yeah, that's right.

1583
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,990
听着  还有一件事  还有一件事
Listen, one more thing, one more thing.

1584
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,080
啥事
What?

1585
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,440
把你的枪给我
Give me your gun.

1586
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,470
把你的枪给我
Give me your gun.

1587
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,550
你不是认真的吧
You're not serious.

1588
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,560
我是认真的
Yes, I am.

1589
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,920
谢谢
Thank you.

1590
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,110
我们经历了那么多事  你真的要这样做吗
You're really gonna do this after everything we've been through?

1591
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,070
手臂还是大腿
Arm or leg?

1592
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,670
这不会让你好受些的
This is not gonna make you feel better.

1593
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,710
我想还是腿好  因为腿上肉更多  这样不会伤到骨头
I'm thinking leg. Because leg, there's more flesh, there's not as much bone.

1594
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,990
手臂就可能...
The arm will...

1595
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,550
你知道吗  你简直就是个...
You know what you are? You are a petty...

1596
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,080
狗娘养的
Fucking son of a bitch!

1597
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,110
很痛啊  你知道吗  要是搞不好你可能害死我啊
Hurts, doesn't it? You know you coulda killed me?

1598
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,110
不会吧  再向左三英尺你才会死呢
Is that right? Three more inches to the left.

1599
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,190
这完全是两码事好吗
Don't even say it, man.

1600
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,670
你不会再对服务生抛媚眼了吧
You wouldn't be winking at waitresses anymore.

1601
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,710
我还是会的  我总是不能自已
I'd still wink, I just wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

1602
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,910
你知道我的  我从不失手
You know me, I don't miss.

1603
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,590
-我从来不会失手  -你上次看到我失手是什么时候
-I never miss. -When's the last time you saw me miss?

1604
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,250
你这下一路都得背着我了
You gonna carry my ass all the way the fuck home.

1605
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,280
嘿  慢点  很疼哎
Oh, shit, man. This burns.

1606
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,770
那就对了
That's correct.

1607
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,830
你知道  我向你开枪的时候我还不知道你是谁呢
You know, I shot you when I didn't know who you were.

1608
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,310
我们是一家人之前
Before we were family.

1609
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,390
但是现在不一样了
There's a difference.

1610
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,760
但我们现在是一家人  我向你开枪因为我知道你是谁了
But we're family now. I shot you because I know who you are.

1611
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,080
这就不对了
That ain't right.

1612
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,800
他们肯定看到了
They definitely got the look.

1613
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,760
防风墨镜加上那副臭脸  绝对是中情局的人
Assholes and windshield sunglasses, practically CIA uniform.

1614
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,760
你们还要吃点什么吗
Can I get you boys anything else?

1615
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,080
我想试试你们的甜甜圈
Are your doughnuts any good?

1616
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,560
跟你说实话吧  甜甜圈味道真的一般
Tell you the truth, they're pretty lousy.

1617
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,880
听到这个消息真是太好了  看来你没戏咯
Can't tell you how happy we are to hear that.

1618
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,120
欢迎下次再来
You take care.

1619
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,470
我看到了哦
I saw that.

1620
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,950
-看到什么了  -你抛媚眼了
-Saw what? -You winked.

1621
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,530
-那个叫勾引  -好吧  是的
-That's a twitch. -Yeah, right.

1622
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,590
你知道的  对于一个刚刚炸飞四千三百万的人来说
You know, for a guy who just blew up $43 million,

1623
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,710
你给的小费倒是不少啊
all of a sudden, you are a very generous tipper.

1624
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,000
谁说我炸飞了四千三百万
Who said I blew up $43 million?

1625
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,910
你在说什么呢
What are you sayin'?

1626
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,230
我什么都没说  你听到了啥呀
I'm not sayin' anything. What are you hearing?

1627
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,230
我听到了我很感兴趣的事  你刚刚说了
I'm hearin' somethin'. You're sayin' somethin'.

1628
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,270
好吧  如果你听到了  那么说明只是你听到了
Well, if you're hearin' it, it's only because you're hearin' it,

1629
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,790
我可啥都没说
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

1630
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,290
你留了多少
How much did you keep?

1631
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,480
两百万
Two million?

1632
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,150
我们一人能有一百万哦
That's like one each.

1633
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,470
所以你拿一半
So now you get half?

1634
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,600
-你看  我打死了一半的人  -那又怎样
-Well, I shot half the guys. -So?

1635
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,210
真的是两百万
Two million?

1636
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:33,210
