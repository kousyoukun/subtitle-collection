我不要鸡蛋 我想吃蔬菜肉丁
I don't want eggs. I want hash.

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,681
在上面放点鸡蛋也行
You know what, put a couple eggs on it.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,999

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
为什么不给我100,000的可卡因呢?
Why didn't you give me $100,000 worth of cocaine?

137
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,119
可卡因在哪?
Where's the cocaine?

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,565
我的买家想要可卡因
My buyer wants cocaine.

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,279
那就让他买呗
So let him buy cocaine.

140
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,079
他就是这么打算的 他想买可卡因
That's what he's tryin' to do. He's trying to buy cocaine.

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,639
我告诉他我认识卖家 所以我就来找你了
I told him I knew a guy, therefore I come to you.

142
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,563
你就是我认识的卖家 所以我才跟人说了
You the guy I know. That's why I told him.

143
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,119
那把护照拿回去吧
So take back the passports.

144
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,203
在小托罗之后 我们不再接待新的顾客了
After Little Toro, we're not takin' on any new customers.

145
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,679
别这么失礼嘛 我又不是新顾客
Well, no disrespect, but I ain't no new customer.

146
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,126
你跟我打交道很久了
You been dealin' with me for a long time.

147
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,605
你把护照留着吧
You keep the passports.

148
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,719
钱也留着
Keep the money, too.

149
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,759
什么时候你能给我货了 再给我
When you're ready to give me the product, give me the product.

150
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,886
算...
Till then...

151
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
你欠我的
You owe me.

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,119
这样可不算运动 兄弟们
It's not very sporting, man.

153
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,566
至少要给这些鸡反击的机会吧
At least give the chickens a chance to shoot back.

154
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,245
嘿 兄弟 我说如果让我杀只毫无还手之力的动物
Hey, man, I'm just sayin'. If I'm gonna kill a defenseless animal,

155
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,959
我会把它做成美味的烧烤以尊重它的牺牲
I'm gonna honor its sacrifice by grilling it into some tasty barbecue.

156
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,759
我可不会折磨它
What I'm not gonna do is torture it

157
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,491
来证明我打不到离我小弟弟更远的东西
just to prove I can't hit anything further away than my own pecker.

158
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,171
- 你手下可真能吠啊  - 是啊
- Your cuate's a real junkyard dog.  - Mmm.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
你们什么时候认识的?

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,800
有一晚我给了他点甜头 他就给我回家了

161
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,639
嘿 长得帅的那个牛仔
Hey, cowboy. You, the pretty one.

162
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,849
你有没有听过"你长了张亲娘才会喜欢的脸"?
You ever hear the expression, "You got a face only a mother can love"?

163
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,164
这话不适合你 你长得简直连亲娘都看不过眼
That don't apply to you. You are uglier than the devil's asshole itself.

164
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,327
斯蒂格!
Stig!

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,801
你在干嘛?
What are you doin'?

166
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,999
他们在折磨这些鸡 兄弟
They're torturing chickens, man.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,331
你在吃什么?
What are you eatin'?

168
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,839
鸡腿
A chicken.

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,239
过来 这不一样 明白?
Come here. It's not the same thing, okay?

170
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,799
看到桌边那个袋子吗?
See that bag over there by the table?

171
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
土豆沙拉旁边的自助餐桌
Buffet table next to the potato salad.

172
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,039
看到了 保龄球袋 怎么了?
Yeah, the bowling bag. What about it?

173
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,168
小托罗的头在那个袋子里
Little Tom's head is in that bag.

174
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,530
- 不是吧  - 是的
- Bullshit.  - Yeah.

175
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,563
知道吗? 这也太过分了 老兄
You know what? That's fucked up, man.

176
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,319
嘿 哇 哇 我们走吧 好吗? 快点 走吧
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go. Okay? Come on, let's go.

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,640
说英语 你这个色鬼
Say it in English, you goat fuck.

178
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,599
来给我吹箫吧
Suck my chicken.

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,999
你这么说还真奇怪 肥仔
That's funny comin' from you, fat boy.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
你从婴儿起就没见过你的小弟弟吧
You ain't seen your pecker since you were a baby.

181
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,199
不能因为你把手指放到肚脐上
Just 'cause you put your finger in your belly button

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,806
有便便流出来 你就觉得那是你的菊花了
and brown shit comes out don't mean it's your asshole.

183
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,809
- 你说什么呢?  - 别担心 兄弟
- What did you say?  - Don't worry about it, man.

184
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,328
把它们挖出来 做烧烤吧
Now dig 'em up and make some damn barbecue.

185
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,046
拜拜 娘炮
Bye, chica.

186
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,131
你刚刚跟他抛媚眼了?
Did you just wink at him?

187
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,839
我是跟他抛媚眼了 他现在算我的小相好了
I did wink at him, 'cause he's my bitch now.

188
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,841
不是吧!
Uh... oh!

189
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,448
- 射得好  - 谢谢夸奖
- That's good shootin'.  - Gracias.

190
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,281
你该知道 小托罗死得不明不白 兄弟
You know, Little Toro never did nothin' to nobody, man.

191
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,085
我们应该去特雷司・克鲁塞斯储贷公司把帕皮藏起来的钱偷走
We should rip off Papi's stash at the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

192
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,079
帕皮的手下每两周就会把一个
You know, Papi's guy delivers a briefcase

193
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,919
装满钱的公文包送到特雷司・克鲁塞斯去
full of money to Tres Cruces every two weeks.

194
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,729
加起来至少也有300万了吧
That's gotta add up to, what, like three million at least.

195
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,203
如果帕皮知道我们在考虑抢劫特雷司・克鲁塞斯
If Papi knew we were even talkin' about rippin' off Tres Cruces,

196
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,204
土豆沙拉旁边的袋子里装的就是我们的脑袋了
it would be our heads in that bag next to the potato salad.

197
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,330
不可能 那袋子那么小装不下我们俩的脑袋
No way. Our two heads would never fit in a bag that small.

198
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,959
走吧 兄弟 去抢银行吧
Come on, man, let's hit the bank.

199
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,928
小托罗是你的朋友 也是我朋友
Little Toro was your friend. He was my friend.

200
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,809
- 那又怎么样呢?  - 这是什么意思?
- So?  - What do you mean "so"?

201
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,043
如果是我呢? 如果帕皮砍的是我的脑袋呢?
What if it was me? What if it was my head Papi ran through the saw mill?

202
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,730
- 你不会追杀他?  - 不会
- You wouldn't come after him?  - Nope.

203
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,599
- 不会杀了他?  - 不会
- You wouldn't kill him?  - Nope.

204
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,921
该死的 他要是那么对你 我会杀了他 你知道为什么吗?
Shit, man, he did that to you, I'd kill him. You know why I'd kill him?

205
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,559
因为我们是一伙的 而且我们有代号
Because you're my people and there's a code.

206
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,159
首先 根本没有代号
There is no code, first of all.

207
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,479
你总是随心所欲 不管付出什么代价
You do whatever you gotta do, whatever it takes.

208
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
其次呢?
And second?

209
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,839
说得对 我们不是一伙的 你都没同伙
Right, we're not people 'cause you don't have people.

210
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,046
说对了
That's correct.

211
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,764
去墨西哥的目的是什么?
Purpose for your visit to Mexico?

212
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,967
捕猎鹌鹑
Quail hunting.

213
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,811
我在图巴市的婶婶心脏病发了 所以我们缩短了行程
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart attack so we cut our trip short.

214
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,119
图巴市?
Tuba City?

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,326
靠近奥德萨市
It's near Odessa.

216
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,719
好地方?
Nice place?

217
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,722
烂地方 但她是我最喜欢的婶婶
Hellhole, but she's my favorite aunt.

218
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,561
- 别动 举起手来  - 该死
- Don't move. Let me see your hands.  - Oh, shit.

219
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,410
- 说说你的旅行吧  - 我要见律师
- Tell us about your trip.  - Lawyer.

220
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,679
- 有什么不能说的?  - 我要见律师
- What's the big deal?  - Lawyer.

221
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,648
你去了索诺拉 是不是?
You were down in Sonora, weren't you?

222
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,764
你以为杰瑟普探员和禁药取缔机构会不认识你和帕皮・格雷科?
You don't think Agent Jessup and the DEA know about you and Papi Greco?

223
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,119
律师呢 我要律师
Lawyer. Lawyer.

224
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,159
他们知道你去了他的牧场
They know you were at his ranch.

225
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,321
我只知道我要见律师
I know I need a lawyer.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
把帕皮・格雷科的事情跟里斯探员说说
Tell Agent Rees about Papi Greco.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,843
- 谁?  - 帕皮・格雷科
- Who?  - Papi Greco.

228
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,845
那是谁? 墨西哥圣诞老人还是别的什么?
Well, who's that? Some Mexican Santa Claus or something?

229
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,289
别装了 斯蒂格曼先生
Come on, Mr. Stigman.

230
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,320
我觉得跟我们合作对你最有利
I think it's in your best interest to cooperate.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
别再玩什么把戏了 行吗?
You need to stop playin' the stupid card, all right?

232
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,799
长官 我是很乐意跟你们合作的
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to cooperate with whatever you need.

233
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,879
作为一个美国人 我知道你在履行职责
I mean, as an American, I know you're just doin' your job,

234
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,999
有时候也会错抓像我这样的无辜民众
and sometimes innocent folks like me get caught up in the system.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,519
就像航空公司 他们又不会故意弄丢你的行李 是吧?
It's like the airlines. They don't lose your luggage on purpose, right?

236
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,399
但是大家都太自私了
But everybody takes it so damn personal.

237
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,159
够了 斯蒂格曼先生 还想玩把戏吗?
Come on, Mr. Stigman. So you wanna play games?

238
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,961
你到底在想什么?
Well, what'd you have in mind?

239
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,369
- 你想救自己吗?  - 当然
- Do you wanna help yourself?  - Yes.

240
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,161
我真要在他面前这么做吗?
Do I have to do it in front of him?

241
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,887
好吧 谈话结束 谢谢 斯蒂格曼先生
All right, we're done here. Thank you, Mr. Stigman.

242
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,485
- 你这就走了?  - 是的
- You gonna leave?  - Oh, yes.

243
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,567
哇
Wow.

244
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,205
天啊
Oh, my God.

245
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,647
你跟她在一块怎么能专心工作的 兄弟?
How do you concentrate workin' with her, man?

246
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,721
我们说话的功夫里 五名边界探员已经搜查过你的车了
Five border agents are rippin' apart your car as we speak.

247
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
他们什么都没找不到
They ain't gonna find anything.

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,490
你把可卡因藏在哪里了?
Where'd you hide the cocaine?

249
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,649
- 外面的人能听到吗?  - 听不到
- Can they hear us?  - No.

250
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,251
- 能看到我们吗?  - 看不到
- Can they see us?  - No.

251
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,726
好吧
Okay.

252
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,245
根本就没有可卡因
There was no cocaine.

253
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,639
- 你们在当地交易了  - 是的
- You had a deal in place.  - Right.

254
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,199
五百个护照来交换可卡因
Five hundred passports in return for cocaine.

255
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,406
是的
Right.

256
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,879
嘿 鲍比
Hey, Bobby.

257
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
过得好吗 黛比?
How you doin', Deb?

258
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,249
很好 兄弟 你的手下斯蒂格是块好料子
Good. Man, your boy Stig's a piece of work.

259
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,925
他朝你抛媚眼了 是不是?
He winked at you, didn't he?

260
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,241
你怎么知道的?
How'd you know?

261
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,490
鲍比没拿到可卡因
Bobby didn't get the cocaine.

262
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,051
什么? 怎么回事?
What? What happened?

263
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,399
帕皮给了我现金 我拒绝了
Papi offered me cash. I told him no.

264
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,004
我让他把护照留着
I told him to keep the passports,

265
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,159
最后他肯定会交出可卡因的
so, eventually, he's gotta come up with the cocaine.

266
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,925
那你说可以拉拢的那个人怎么样? 小托罗?
What about this guy you said you could flip? Little Toro?

267
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,288
我就差一点就说服他了
I got him. It's real close.

268
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,723
我已经不知道你是谁了
I don't know who you are anymore.

269
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,646
就像...
It's like...

270
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,884
你已经脱离了组织
It's like you're out on this limb.

271
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,162
脱离得太远了
And you've been out there way too long.

272
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,924
你到底想说什么?
And you're sayin' that to say what?

273
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,684
我可不想去我自己手下的葬礼
I don't like goin' to the funerals of my own men.

274
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,207
那就别来了 头儿 别来了
Well, then don't come, boss. Don't come.

275
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,407
好吗?
Okay?

276
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,364
过去的三年里
I spent the last three years of my life

277
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,766
我在墨西哥苟且偷生
crawlin' through a Mexican sewer

278
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,280
一心想要抓到帕皮・格雷科
tryin' to work my way up the line to get next to Papi Greco.

279
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,044
你不能现在把我撤出去
You can't take me off this now.

280
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,247
杰瑟普 他快得手了
Jessup, he's close.

281
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,442
- 不能现在把我撤出去  - 我明白
- You can't take me off this now.  - I know.

282
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,251
现在不行
Not now.

283
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,250
给你两个礼拜的时间
Two weeks.

284
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,610
如果那时候你还没拉拢小托罗 我就把你撤出去
You don't flip Little Toro by then, I'm pullin' ya out.

285
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,166
就这么说定了
We're done.

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,004
你觉得杰瑟普知道我们的事吗?
Think Jessup knows about us?

287
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,167
"我们"的事? 你从不在乎"我们" 不是吗?
What "us"? You don't do "us," remember?

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,365
哦 好吧
Oh, I remember.

289
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,403
另外 我谈恋爱了
Besides, I'm dating.

290
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,519
好吧 你谈恋爱了...
Oh, right, right. You're dating...

291
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,679
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

292
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,843
你的假想男友 哈维
Your imaginary boyfriend, Harvey.

293
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,044
他不是我男朋友 他也不叫哈维
Uh, he's not my boyfriend, and his name's not Harvey.

294
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,329
我喜欢哈维这个名字 很好听
I like Harvey. It has a nice ring to it. Harvey.

295
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,519
你没资格吃醋 鲍比
You don't get to be jealous anymore, Bobby.

296
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,726
哈维
Harvey.

297
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,039
是你拒绝了我
You pushed me away.

298
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,565
所以你就和哈维在一起了
So you could be with Harvey.

299
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,250
去死吧你
Fuck you.

300
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,171
小托罗死了
Little Toro's dead.

301
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,121
可你告诉杰瑟普你快要拉拢他了
You told Jessup you were close to flipping him.

302
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,560
本来快了
I was.

303
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,599
但当我去农场的时候
But when I got down to the ranch,

304
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,762
我看到帕皮的手下把他的头装在袋子里
Papi's boys was throwin' his head around in a bag.

305
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,604
那也没办法
Well, that's game, then.

306
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,681
没有小托罗接应 杰瑟普会把你撤出去的
With Little Toro off the board, Jessup's pulling you out.

307
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,921
你不说 他就不会知道
Not if you don't tell him.

308
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,759
- 我是你的上级  - 是的
- I'm your control, Bobby.  - That's correct.

309
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,761
我有责任告诉他
I have to tell him.

310
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,168
所以我才需要你
That's why I need you

311
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,683
批准我去抢特雷司・克鲁塞斯储贷银行
to let me rob Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

312
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,927
你要抢银行?
You want to rob a bank?

313
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,281
不 是斯蒂格想要抢银行 是他的主意
No, Stig wants to rob the bank. It's his idea.

314
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,726
我们没有阴谋
So there's no entrapment.

315
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,399
我只是想拿到
What I want is access to that money

316
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,448
帕皮放在保险箱里的钱
that Papi's got in the safe deposit box.

317
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,159
要知道法官可不会批准
You know no judge is gonna give you

318
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,730
你去搜查那些保险箱的
a blanket warrant for the boxes.

319
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,764
不需要搜查令 因为那些钱是赃款
We don't need a warrant. Not if the money's evidence in a crime.

320
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,319
我们只要追查钱的来源
We just trace it back to ownership,

321
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,164
抓到帕皮偷税的证据 就能根据反诈骗法起诉他
we got Papi on tax evasion, possible RICO.

322
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,051
- 是吗?  - 嗯
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

323
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,359
那斯蒂格怎么办?
And what about Stig?

324
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,441
怎么了?
What about him?

325
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,841
他好办
He's a side dish.

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,279
当着银行人的面把他抓住
You bust him in front of the bank,

327
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,965
判他20年监禁 就大功告成了
he does a smooth 20 years in the penitentiary, you get a medal.

328
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,130
抢银行能让我们抓到帕皮
The bank gets us Papi.

329
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,605
你要的就是这样 是吧?
And that's all that matters, right?

330
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,528
我会不惜一切代价的 宝贝
It takes whatever it takes, baby.

331
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,802
你爱过我吗?
Did you ever really love me?

332
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,441
嗯?
Hmm?

333
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,005
我很想爱你的
I really meant to love you.

334
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,320
该死
Shit.

335
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,204
门从来不关 你不用敲门
You don't have to knock. It's always open.

336
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,482
好 我们去抢银行吧
Yeah, good. Let's hit the bank.

337
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,681
去抢银行吧
Let's hit the bank.

338
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,484
- 特雷司・克鲁塞斯储贷银行?  - 没错
- The Tres Cruces?  - That's correct.

339
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,687
算了吧
Oh, shit.

340
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,799
入境的时候我们为什么被警察带走 我现在还一头雾水呢
Here I am still spinnin' about how we got yanked outta line at the border.

341
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,643
那你去不去?
So you in or you out?

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,929
我当然去 只是...
I'm in, yeah. It's just...

343
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,367
你以前遇到过这种事情吗?
have you ever had anything like that happen to you before?

344
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,046
他们好像确信我们持有毒品
I mean, they were 100% convinced we were holding.

345
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,601
而且如果帕皮没耍滑头 我们确实会持有毒品
And we would've if Papi hadn't welched on that coke.

346
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,999
你说这些什么意思?
So you're sayin' that to say what?

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,650
我就是说给你听听
I'm sayin' it's only 'cause you're hearin' it.

348
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,959
不 你肯定有什么意思
No, you sayin' somethin'.

349
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,199
你想跟我说什么
And if you sayin' it, I'm hearin' it 'cause you're sayin' it.

350
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,319
直说出来吧
What are you sayin'? Let it be said.

351
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,799
我觉得你他妈的是在玩我
I think you're fuckin' playin' me.

352
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,847
你想被玩吗?
Are you wanna be played?

353
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,999
我跟着你10个月了
I've been at your hip for 10 months,

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,880
但出了这事 我觉得你可能是在玩我
but after this, I think maybe you're playin' me.

355
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,919
- 你上当了  - 不 我没有
- I got you.  - No, you didn't.

356
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,399
你有 你眼角抽动了
Oh, I did. The corner of your eye was twitchin'.

357
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,970
眼角? 我的眼角没抽动
The corner? That wasn't a twitch.

358
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,889
- 那是抛媚眼  - 那是我的招牌动作
- That was a wink.  - That's my move.

359
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,607
那是帕皮胖得像圆球的儿子
Yup, that's Papi's chubby little kid right there.

360
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,890
整天吃油炸玉米粉饼...
Feed that motherfucker quesadillas...

361
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,159
天啊
Oh, my God.

362
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,199
她也很圆
She's chubby, too.

363
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,479
但圆的很是地方
In all the right places.

364
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,881
凭什么那个糟老头能娶到这样的美人?
How does an old, fat, ugly fuck get a girl like that?

365
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,326
因为有钞票
Money.

366
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,521
好了 他来了
All right, here we go.

367
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,043
每隔两周
Same thing every two weeks.

368
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,159
帕皮都会带着一箱现金 乘飞机穿过边境
Papi flies over the border with a briefcase full of cash.

369
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,439
然后他陪妻子一周
He spends a week with the mistress.

370
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,759
费雷・诺斯・胡里奥把钱
Ferret Nose Julio drives it out

371
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,205
送到特雷司・克鲁塞斯储贷银行
to the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

372
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,439
现在有三百万了吧?
Think they got three million in the bank, huh?

373
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,521
真是轻松
Easy.

374
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,201
来了
Bingo.

375
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,479
都是钱啊 都是钱啊
Money, money, money, money.

376
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,766
是啊
Oh, yeah.

377
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,359
你去餐馆点个甜甜圈怎么样?
Why don't you hit the diner and check out the doughnuts?

378
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,409
说实话 我更想吃熏牛肉配土豆泥
I'm kinda more in a corned beef hash mood, to tell you the truth.

379
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,006
你没听过那句老话吗
You never heard the saying,

380
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,679
"永远不要抢三郡最佳
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

381
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,569
甜甜圈饭店对面的银行"?
that has the best doughnuts in three counties"?

382
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,360
- 没有这句老话  - 有
- That's not a saying.  - Yes, it is.

383
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,839
- 这是你说的 不是什么老话  - 你没听过吗?
- I get what you're sayin', but it's not a saying.  - You never heard it?

384
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,959
这现在是句老话了
It is a saying. It's a saying now.

385
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,007
好吧 不跟你废话了
Okay. Let you tell it.

386
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,481
行动吧
Make the move.

387
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,489
缉毒局不良探员
Bad DEA agent.

388
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,245
- 我坏吗?  - 是的
- Am I bad?  - Yes, you are.

389
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,401
我是个坏女孩?
I'm a bad girl?

390
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,726
是的
Yes, you are.

391
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,242
斯蒂格决定明天3:00去抢劫银行
Stig decided to hit the bank tomorrow, 3:00.

392
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,805
斯蒂格决定?
Stig decided?

393
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,566
无论我去不去 他都会去
Well, with or without me, he's goin' in.

394
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,449
我还没向杰瑟普报告
Well, I still haven't talked to Jessup.

395
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,126
斯蒂格不知道这个 明天3:00他要行动了
Stig doesn't know that. 3:00 tomorrow he's goin' in.

396
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,567
如果我们想抓到帕皮 我得和他一起去
If we want Papi, I gotta go in with him.

397
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,482
你让我别无选择 不是吗?
You're not even gonna give me a choice, are you?

398
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,089
我不让你选择是在保护你
I'm givin' you no other options as a way to protect you.

399
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,208
你去通知警方 明天3:05银行门口等着我们
Just have the troops meet me outside the bank, 3:05 when we come out.

400
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,359
3:05 是吗
3:05.

401
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,691
别朝我开枪
Okay. And don't shoot me.

402
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,928
- 你看着办吧  - 那我看看
- Even if you want to.  - We'll see.

403
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,245
请出示证件 小伙子
License and registration, cowboy.

404
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,281
好样的
Cute.

405
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,279
- 怎么了 提莫?  - 怎么了 哥们?
- What's up, Teemo?  - What's up, brother?

406
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,930
- 还好吗 哥们? 我很想你  - 我也想你
- How are you, brother? I miss you, man.  - I miss you, man.

407
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,082
给你留了一个火鸡汉堡 加了酱汁
Got you a turkey burger. Special sauce.

408
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,559
指挥官想见你
Commander wants to see you.

409
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,686
好的
Yes, sir.

410
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,648
快要成功了
So, half a mile from home.

411
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,767
鲍比已经跃跃欲试了
I got Bobby all wound up and ready to go, sir.

412
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,645
这是你申请的武器
Ordnance you requested.

413
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,519
知道吗 上将对你的表现很满意
Do you know, the Admiral's proud of what you've done.

414
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,759
离成功之差一步之遥
You've gone way out on a limb.

415
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,759
如果明天银行的计划成功
If the bank falls right tomorrow,

416
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,599
他答应把你调回来 重新回到队伍里
he says you can come in from the cold, rejoin your brothers.

417
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,239
太好了 能再穿上军装我就知足了
Great. Be good just to put the uniform back on, sir.

418
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,839
我参军可不是为了和毒贩一起违法乱纪的
I didn't join the Navy to commit felonies and hang with drug dealers.

419
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,808
你可是个出色的罪犯
Even if you're damn good at it?

420
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,689
我只是服从命令
I do what I do for the Navy, sir.

421
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,199
这些都是上将的计划
It's all part of the Admiral's plan.

422
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,559
我们把这三百万从银行里取出来
We get this three million from the bank,

423
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,919
就能采取跨界行动 捣毁帕皮他们的窝点
we run cross-border ops on Papi and all the other cartels.

424
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,048
所以明天的目标只有一个
So tomorrow, clean and precise.

425
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,239
就是拿走保险箱里所有的钱 一分不剩 明白吗?
Tick all the boxes, nothing left undone. You got it?

426
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,685
明白
Yes, sir.

427
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,447
出发
Let's go.

428
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,361
嘿 夹克不错
Hey, nice jacket.

429
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,439
嘿 告诉你母亲一声
Hey, tell your mother she's gotta move out

430
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,010
她得从我的房子里搬出去了
of my house at some point, man.

431
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,087
你要哪个头套 小丑还是怪物?
All right, what do you want, clown or Frankie?

432
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,051
怪物
Frankie.

433
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,768
你用那22块干什么了?
So, what'd you do with the 22?

434
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,241
我从我表哥那里买了台咖啡机
Traded to my cousin for an espresso machine.

435
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,647
那你需要特制的咖啡豆 是吧?
You're gonna need special beans for that, right?

436
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,239
停 停
Uh, uh, uh.

437
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,686
你可以掏手枪 不过你可要想好了
You can reach for your firearm, but do it real slow.

438
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,401
这楼里还有其他人吗?
Any other people in the buildin'?

439
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,959
- 这是怎么回事?  - 抢银行
- What the hell is this?  - It's a bank robbery.

440
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,279
只是先把你们关起来
Only instead of robbin' the bank

441
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,599
这样过一会儿
and lettin' you chase after us,

442
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,443
你们就不用追着我们傻跑了
we decided to come after you first.

443
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
走吧
Let's go.

444
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,561
警察局

445
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,930
把枪交给我
All right, give me your gun, there.

446
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,765
所有人都坐下 坐在地上
All right, everybody sit down. Everybody sit down on the floor.

447
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,719
柜台后面的女士 把手举起来 不要放在警报器上
Ladies behind the counter, keep your hands visible, not on the alarms.

448
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,721
快走 快走!
Let's go, let's go!

449
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,247
别怕 姑娘们 把抽屉里所有的钱都给他们
It's all right, girls. Just give 'em the drawer cash.

450
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,245
我们说要抽屉里的钱了吗?
Did we ask for the drawer cash?

451
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
快点 坐下 坐下
Come on, come on, come on. Sit right here. Sit, sit.

452
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,199
坐在地上
Let's go, on the floor.

453
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,680
- 嘿 小心那个保安!  - 嘿! 嘿
- Hey, guard!  - Hey! Hey.

454
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,687
不要敬酒不吃 好吗?
Look, I'm tryin' to be polite, all right?

455
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,769
好好坐着 一会就好了
Just sit tight and this'll be over soon.

456
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,321
打开门
Open the gate.

457
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,439
我没有钥匙
I don't have a key.

458
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,441
你说什么?
What'd you say?

459
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,721
好了
Easy.

460
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,439
如果你再骗我一次 你就要倒霉了
You lie to me again, it's gonna be more than a fuckin' problem.

461
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,441
滚过去
Get out there, now.

462
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,919
在地上坐好
Get on the floor.

463
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,570
准备好了吗? 我进去了
You good? I'm goin' in.

464
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,760
嘘 没事的
Shh. It's all right.

465
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,570
哦 蒂莫西
Oh, Timothy.

466
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,489
嘿 别怕
Hey, it's okay.

467
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,331
别怕 嗯?
It's okay. Yeah?

468
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,968
好了 给你
Okay. Here you go.

469
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,123
烟火表演马上开始!
Showtime! Fire in the hole!

470
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,531
糟糕!
Holy shit!

471
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,999
嘿 怪物 有点不对劲
Hey, Frankie, somethin's not right.

472
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,889
所有的箱子都装满现金
They're all stuffed with money.

473
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,844
你说过只有一两箱现金的
I thought you said there would only be one or two.

474
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,769
每个里面都是现金
Every single one of them.

475
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,082
一共有32个保险箱
I'm at 32 boxes and counting.

476
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,123
肯定不止三百万
Look, there's way more than 3 million.

477
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,163
这里还有很多
And there's still a lot more here.

478
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,800
好吧 全带走 以后再数
All right, well, take 'em all. We'll figure it out later.

479
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,079
你先走 我去搬剩下的
You go ahead, I'll get the rest.

480
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,161
好吧
All right.

481
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
听着
Listen.

482
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
等会外面可能会有枪响
May be gunfire outside, okay? So if it hits,

483
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
你带着大家躲到柜台后面
you get everybody behind the counters.

484
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,119
这是对面警察局牢房的钥匙
This is for the jail across the street.

485
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,282
你去把那里的警察放出来
You let the cops out. Let'em out.

486
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,041
快点
Come on.

487
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,889
这是可远远不止三百万美元
That is a hell of a lot more than $3 million.

488
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,166
你数了有多少了吗?
How much, you figure?

489
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,800
我们今天难道是走了狗屎运?
We couldn't be the luckiest chumps on the face of the earth, could we?

490
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,644
- 你觉得幸运?  - 不
- You feel lucky?  - No, I don't.

491
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,370
这不是帕皮的钱
I mean, this can't be Papi's money.

492
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,439
拿了这些钱 他们肯定会追着我们不放
People are gonna chase us off the end of the earth for money like this.

493
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,920
不好意思 斯蒂格 但我有个不幸的消息...
Well, I hate to tell you this, Stig, but I got more bad news...

494
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,843
把手慢慢地从背后拿出来 鲍比
You take that hand away nice and slow, Bobby.

495
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,001
好了
Okay.

496
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,531
把枪放下 斯蒂格
Put the gun down, Stig.

497
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,599
知道吗? 我很喜欢你
You know I really like you, right?

498
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,806
我也很喜欢你
I like you, too.

499
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,286
- 不 你不喜欢我  - 我喜欢你
- No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

500
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,239
没人喜欢我 而且我习惯了
Nobody likes me, okay? And I'm okay with it.

501
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,685
我喜欢你 你比其他人都好
I do. I like you more than most.

502
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,599
是因为我拿着枪指着你 你才这么说的吗?
You're not just sayin' it 'cause I got a gun pointed to you?

503
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,204
为什么不把枪放下来呢?
Why don't you just put the gun down?

504
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,839
该死
Shit.

505
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,959
哦
Oh.

506
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,769
没搞错吧!
Hot-doggin'!

507
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,441
抱歉了 哥们
I'm sorry, man.

508
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,087
你为什么要这么做?
What'd you do that for?

509
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,890
- 我不得不这么做!  - 不可能
- Shit, man, I had to!  - No, you didn't.

510
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,959
就是一点皮肉伤 没事的
It's just a little flesh wound. You'll be all right.

511
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,640
喝点药 你就没事了...
Drink the water, and then you'll be able...

512
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,011
那是什么?
What is that?

513
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,681
你手里拿的是警徽吗?
In your hand. Is that a badge in your hand?

514
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,479
别他妈告诉我 你是个内鬼
Tell me you're not a no-good, two-timin' son of a bitch.

515
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,559
内鬼?
Two-timin'?

516
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,483
- 快说  - 是你开枪打了我
- Tell me.  - You shot me.

517
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,569
等一下 等一下
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, man. Hang on.

518
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,285
别走
No, you wait a minute.

519
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,766
斯蒂格
Stig.

520
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,281
嘿
Hey.

521
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,206
美国是世界上最伟大的国家
The United States is the greatest country in the world

522
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,365
因为我们可以接受人们
because we accept a man is, at his core,

523
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,246
贪婪
greedy,

524
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,720
自私
selfish

525
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,521
的本性
and covetous.

526
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,206
我没办法 他们抢走了钥匙
I had no choice. They took my key.

527
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,169
我不是心甘情愿地打开金库门的
I would never willingly open the vault.

528
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,368
把手放在桌子上
Keep your hands on the desk, please.

529
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,363
在美国人人平等
In America, we line everybody up.

530
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,729
所以 "人定胜天"
Say, "You're on your own."

531
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,525
"抓住一切机会"
"Grab all you can grab."

532
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,047
我是无辜的
I'm innocent.

533
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,047
没有人是无辜的
Nobody's innocent, friend.

534
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,085
这世间只有罪恶
There's just the guilty,

535
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,411
和狂妄
the ignorant

536
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,811
还有不幸
and the unlucky.

537
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,644
是不是你拿了我的钱?
Did you take our money?

538
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,121
你们看来就像等车一样悠哉
You fellas look like you're waitin' for a bus.

539
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,239
你完事了告诉我们一声
You guys let us know when you're done.

540
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,403
我完事了 谢谢你们配合
Oh, I'm done, and thank you for the courtesy.

541
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,561
他是谁?
Who is that guy?

542
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,279
你听说过上帝魔手吗?
You heard of the hidden hand of God?

543
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,248
那家伙就是
Well, that's God's son of a bitch.

544
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,561
打电话给DDO 查出哪些人知道我们放了钱在这儿
Call the DDO and get a list of everyone who knew we had money in this bank.

545
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,923
你俩不觉得戴上墨镜很白痴吗
You two realize those sunglasses make you look like assholes.

546
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,279
打扰下 那家餐馆啥时候爆炸的?
Excuse me, when'd that diner burn?

547
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,399
昨天
Yesterday.

548
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,799
我要见餐馆服务员
I want interviews with the wait staff

549
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,119
和所有在场的客人
and every customer in the place.

550
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,770
只是机油引起火灾而已
It was just a grease fire.

551
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,489
我有问你吗 高莫?
Did I ask your opinion, Gomer?

552
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,079
你有听说过
You ever hear the saying,

553
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,879
"永远不要抢三郡最佳
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

554
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,008
甜甜圈饭店对面的银行"?
with the best doughnuts in three counties"?

555
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,127
如果那家餐馆火灾纯属巧合
If that diner fire's a coincidence,

556
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,601
那是因为我们一直看得不够严
it's only 'cause we ain't looking hard enough.

557
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,206
那可是好大一笔钱
That is an impressive amount of greenbacks.

558
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,931
4312.5万美金 长官
43,125,000 of 'em, sir.

559
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,041
好
Mmm.

560
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,359
重新数下 装起来 我们藏到库里面
Recount it. Pack it up. We'll stow it back in Corpus.

561
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,279
我印象中应该从那银行拿到
It was my impression we were supposed to come out of that bank

562
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,799
最多300万美金 长官
with 3 million at most, sir.

563
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,119
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

564
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,167
这些钱是谁的?
Whose money was it?

565
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,970
坏人不值得拥有
Bad men unworthy of it.

566
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,323
你知道鲍比・宾斯是缉毒局的吗?
Did you know Bobby Beans was DEA?

567
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,441
不知道
No, I didn't.

568
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,321
无意冒犯 你的表情不够惊讶
No offense, sir, but you really need to work on your surprised face.

569
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,570
如果他是缉毒局的 却帮你打劫银行
Well, if he was DEA, he helped you rob a bank.

570
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
非正义所为 我决不饶恕银行劫匪
Which means he's dirty, and for that, I have no mercy.

571
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,568
- 你把他丢在哪了?  - 沙漠
- Where'd you leave him?  - In the desert.

572
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,768
- 他死了吗?  - 差不多
- Is he dead?  - More than likely.

573
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,970
"差不多"
"More than likely."

574
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,765
你知道这意味着什么吗?
You wanna tell me what that means?

575
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,159
让你和鲍比・宾斯合作就是为了
The whole point of you working with Bobby Beans

576
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,519
灭掉他 斩草除根
was to kill him off and create a cut-out

577
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,159
监管所就查不到我们头上来了
so the OP couldn't get traced back to us.

578
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,119
我掩饰得天衣无缝 我们不会被查到的
My cover's solid. There's no way it'll trace back.

579
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,719
我掩饰得天衣无缝 我们不会被查到的 长官
My cover is solid. There's no way it'll trace back, sir.

580
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,882
这里轮得到你做决定吗
That's a call made above your pay grade.

581
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,727
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

582
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,244
派两个人把钱藏到海军基地
Assign two of the boys to stow the money back at the naval base.

583
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,562
其他人跟我们去找宾斯的尸体
The rest'll come with us to check on the body of Mr. Beans.

584
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,364
斯蒂格曼 要一起来吗
Stigman, wanna come with me?

585
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,809
- 你好啊 伙计  - 你好
- Hey there, buddy.  - Hey.

586
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,079

好 那就好
Good, that's good.

590
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,962
没看到证件前 别信他
Don't trust in him till you see his paper.

591
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,682
如果他有证件 我会看的 你有 对吧?
If he's got papers, I'll see his papers. You got papers, right?

592
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,081
不 不 我没证件
No. No, I got no papers.

593
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,969
那就麻烦了
Well, that's gonna be a problem.

594
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,239
瘦杰和我自愿来这

保护边境

596
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,721
既是执行公务 也是个人意愿
Officially unofficially.

597
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,847
所以我们必须检查你的证件
So we really gonna have to see your papers.

598
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,008
确认你是不是穆斯林啥的
Make sure you ain't no Muslim or nothin'.

599

谢谢
Gracias.

603
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,647
你知道怎么祈祷吧?

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,571
提莫 进展怎样啦 伙计们

605
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,763
有看到鲍比・宾斯吗?
Any sign of Bobby Beans?

606
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,929
查遍了东南片区
Checked all the washes to the southeast.

607
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,805
没发现尸体

608
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,046
好吧
All right.

609
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,370
斯蒂格 你让我们大失所望
Well, Stig, you put us in quite a hole.

610
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,279
我不这样认为 长官 您才是指挥官
I don't see it that way, sir, but you're the man with the oak leaves.

611
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,123
你曾经让我引以为豪
All that pride I had in you.

612
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,045
对我忠心耿耿?
That loyalty?

613
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,599
现在你不再值得信任
You just tossed it to the wind

614
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,726
是的 长官 抱歉
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

615

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,770
他不见了
He's in the wash!

617
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,490
快 快 快!
Go, go, go!

618
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,049
快把他找出来!
Come on, let's flush him out!

619
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,644
你去哪儿 斯蒂格曼?
Where you going, Stigman?

620
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,725
逃跑也没用
It doesn't matter if you run.

621
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,366
你被通缉了 现在你是刺伤宪兵后在逃6个月的逃兵
Your jacket's wired, so you're six-months AWOL after stabbing an MP.

622
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,519

把你交回给我处置

你没事吧
You all right?

625
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,643
- 没事  - 那就他妈的赶快起来!
- Yeah.  - Then get your ass up!

626
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,961
扔掉枪
Toss the gun.

627
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,081

天啊! 我该怎么弄啊?
Jesus! What am I supposed to do with this?

632
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,645
天啊!
Aw, man. Aw!

633
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,406
不是吧
Come on.

634
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,806
我是个兽医 不是外科医生
I'm a vet, not a trauma surgeon.

635
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,441
我帮不了你了 你走吧
I can't help you with this, man. You gotta go.

636
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,601
走去哪?
Go where?

637
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,569
你离开吧 我帮不了
You gotta leave. I can't do anything.

638
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,210
肯尼 你记得几个月之前
Kenny, you remember a couple of months ago

639
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,449
说要卖500支氯胺酮给我吗?
you offered to sell me 500 hits of ketamine?

640
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,159
记得 你说没兴趣
Yeah, you said you weren't interested.

641
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,321
对
Right.

642
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,209
因为我是缉毒局探员
'Cause I'm a DEA agent.

643
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,809
如果你不治好我
And if you don't fix me up,

644
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,125
我就去药管局
I'm gonna go to the D.A.,

645
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,682
告诉他们你喜欢在多莉・艾莫丝的演唱会上游荡
I'm gonna tell them that you like cruising Tori Amos concerts,

646
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,804
卖K粉给那些眼泪汪汪的小女生
selling Special K to little weepy college girls.

647
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,166
你不可能是警察
There's no way you're a cop.

648
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,367
- 不可能?  - 对

- 你确定吗?  - 我确定

你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

651
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,959
也有权让律师陪审
You have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.

652
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,999
还要我继续下去吗?
Do I need to keep going?

653
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,759
不 我信了 你是警察
No, I'm good. You're a cop.

658
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,399
好 等一下
All right, hold on one second.

659
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,999

663
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,691
到底发生什么事了?
What the hell happened?

664
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,649
- 不好意思  - 不好意思 让下
- Excuse us.  - Excuse me.

665
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,719
我打劫银行了啊 你呢?
I robbed a bank. What happened to you?

666
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,245
我和6个探员3:05到达那里
I was there with six agents at 3:05.

667

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,519
看来你并没适时亮出警徽
And it's not as if you couldn't have

671
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,488
阻止他抢劫
pulled your badge at any time and stopped it.

672
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,359
- 我阻止了 但斯蒂格射了我一枪  - 什么?
- I did. Stig shot me.  - What?

673
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,169
我肩膀中枪了
He shot me in the shoulder.

674
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,481
我们得带你去医院
We gotta take you to the hospital.

675
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,001
然后打断你和哈维的约会? 我可不想这样
And interrupt your rendezvous with Harvey? I don't think so.

676
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,451
我们现在必须做的是
This is what we need to do,

677
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,921
找到斯蒂格和钱
we need to find Stig, we need to find the money.

678
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,761
好 听着
All right. Listen.

679
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,439
先让我上楼找编个借口离开
Let me go upstairs, make my excuses,

680
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,726
然后我们一起去找斯蒂格 好吗?
and then we'll find Stig together, okay?

681
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,689
好 我们这样吧 这样
Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

682
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,490
你再查下斯蒂格的底
Why don't you recheck Stig's background?

683
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,802
可能我们漏掉了什么 好吗?
Maybe there was something that we missed. All right?

684
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,482
我现在去斯蒂格家 看下能找到什么
I'm going to Stig's apartment and see what I can find out.

685
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,682
- 好吗?  - 好
- All right?  - Okay.

686
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,131
代我向哈维问好
Tell Harvey I said hi.

687
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,684
你帮谁包扎伤口了?
Who'd you patch up?

688
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,970
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

689
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,203
我在说什么?
What am I talkin' about?

690
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,162
外面停着辆沙地车
Well, there's a dune buggy parked out back

691
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,886
是一个中枪的人偷的
that was stolen by a man with a bullet hole in him.

692
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,970
在他中枪前
Now, before he had a bullet hole in him,

693
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,046
他炸了一个饭店 打劫了银行
he burned down a diner and robbed a bank.

694
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,322
我什么都不知道 所以...
I don't know anything about that, so...

695
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,047
好吧
Okay.

696
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,999
好?
Okay?

697
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,081
很好
Fair enough.

698
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,324
我这样问你吧
Say, let me ask you somethin'.

699
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,370
你有玩过俄罗斯轮盘赌吗?
You ever play Russian roulette?

700
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,888
当然没有 我在想什么呢?
'Course not. What am I thinkin'?

701
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,562
主要是 大多数人
The thing is, most people,

702
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,362
都把枪放在太阳穴上
they put the gun to the temple.

703
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,491
嗯 那太笨了
And that's, well, that's just stupid.

704
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,366
假如
What if...

705
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,841
子弹在第一膛怎么办呢?
The bullet's in the first chamber?

706
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,359
你在人家还有机会告诉你想知道的事之前
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

707
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,442
就让人家脑袋开花了
to tell you what you want to know.

708
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,119
不 不 不 不要啊
No. No, no. Come on, man.

709
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,926
多好的例子
Case in point.

710
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,966
斯蒂格!
Stig!

711
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,162
斯蒂格
Stig.

712
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,846
接电话 鲍比
Pick up, Bobby.

713
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,082
你他妈的来这干嘛啊 鲍比?
What the fuck are you doing here, Bobby?

714
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,759
你躲个屁啊
What're you duckin' for, man?

715
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,410
你知道我在算计你 对吧?
You know I set you up, right?

716
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,969
他们告诉我你的底了
They told me all about you.

717
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,528
很难对付 交游广阔 没有亲人
Tough cat. Knows everybody. Doesn't have people.

718
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,605
这样的人最适合清除
That guy? Well, shit, that guy's a perfect cut-out.

719
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,922
要是给他一枪 也没人会在乎的 对吧?
I mean, he takes a bullet, who's gonna care, right?

720
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,931
接电话
Pick up the phone.

721
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,926
接那个破电话 鲍比
Pick up the damn phone, Bobby.

722
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,160
你有话要说吗?
You got anything to say?

723
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,319
第一个问题
First question,

724
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,839
如果你是缉毒局的 清白的 为什么一个人来?
if you're DEA and you're clean, why are you here alone?

725
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,524
你的幕后黑手是谁 鲍比?
Where's your backup, Bobby?

726
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,279
你这种态度
Come on, it's this kind of attitude

727
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,121
让我觉得你不是好人
makes me think you're not one of the good guys.

728
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,519
如果我想的话 在你进入
If I wanted you, I could've had you

729
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,682
那栋楼之前就可以把你毙了 鲍比
before you walked into that building, Bobby.

730
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,328
好酷的枪 斯蒂格
That's a beautiful rifle, Stig.

731
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,891
是部队的吗?
Is that Army issue?

732
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,566
你喜欢吗? 不 从凯马特买回来的 特价
(凯马特是美国最大的打折零售商)
You like that? No, it's Kmart. Blue Light Special.

733
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,848
现在回答我 你的幕后指使者是谁?
Now answer my question. Where's your backup?

734
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,401
不 不 那是军用枪
No, no, that's a military rifle.

735
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,166
军队为什么要打劫银行 斯蒂格?
What's the military doing robbing banks, Stig?

736
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,879
我们可以坦诚相待吗 鲍比?
Can we just have a straight-up conversation, Bobby?

737
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,484
我让你右脑袋开花吧
I got you dead to rights.

738
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,406
是吗? 那射我吧
Yeah? So shoot me.

739
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,006
第二次了
Again.

740
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,921
不射吗?
No?

741
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,565
那我来吧
I'll shoot myself.

742
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,559
哈 手法不错嘛
Huh. Not bad.

743
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,721
谢谢欣赏
I'm glad you're impressed.

744
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,719
你在试我会不会先开枪 对吗?
Were you testing me to see if I would shoot first?

745
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,165
钱在哪里 斯蒂格?
Where's the money, Stig?

746
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,239
如果你是清白的 也许可以告诉你 但你不是
If I thought you were clean, I might tell you, but I don't, so I can't.

747
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,846
你说谎 钱不在你这 对吧? 到底在哪里?
You're lying. You don't have it, do you? Where's the money?

748
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,602
- 噢 不是吧  - 怎么了?
- Oh, shit.  - What?

749
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,479
原来不只有你
You're not the only one I was expecting.

750
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,880
三个恶心的人刚出现了
Three very nasty men just showed up.

751
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,960
如果在我家发现你 后果就严重了
If they find you in my place, they will get ugly.

752
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,201
他们是谁?
Who are they?

753
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,639
昨天我还说 和他们是一家人
Yesterday I'd have said they were my family.

754
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,079
今天他们就要来杀我了
Today they kinda wanna kill me.

755
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,764
- 我明白你的感受  - 去你的
- I understand the feeling.  - You know, fuck you.

756
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,803
你知道什么是家吗? 你连家人都没有
What do you know about family? You don't even have people.

757
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,119
不 鲍比 别走那
No, Bobby, that's a stupid idea.

758
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,201
他们已经上楼了
They're already comin' up the stairs.

759
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,600
鲍比!
Bobby!

760
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,050
跟你说过了 现在这样 鲍比
I told you. Now, Bobby,

761
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,319
把扬声器关了 接你的手机 好吗?
hang up the speaker and answer your cell phone, okay?

762
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,926
如果要我帮忙的话...
If you want me to help you out...

763
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,799
说
Yeah.

764
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,881
先呆在阴影处 好吗?
Just stay in the shadows, okay?

765
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,365
我会引导你逃出来
I'm gonna guide you out from there.

766
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,086
等下
Wait.

767
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,281
等下
Wait.

768
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,599
他在你后面 你最好冲过大厅吧
He's comin' up your rear. You better dart across the hall.

769
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,409
去卧室 躲在柜后面
Go over to the bedroom and hide behind the lockers.

770
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,647
快
Go.

771
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,205
好 鲍比 你冲过去大厅 快
All right, Bobby, you're gonna wanna scoot across the hall. Go.

772
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,399
鲍比
Bobby, Bob...

773
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,161
他妈的
Shit.

774
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,325
- 提莫!  - 屋顶!
- Teemo!  - Rooftop!

775
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,326
目标在移动!
Target's on the move!

776
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,641
抱歉 提莫
Sorry, Teemo.

777
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,129
我们的钱在哪?
Where's our money?

778
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,522
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talkin' about.

779
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,330
你觉得缉毒局冲进我们银行
You think DEA can just waltz into our bank,

780
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,727
偷走我们的钱 我们不会反抗吗?
steal our money, and we're not gonna kick?

781
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,887
你的伙计鲍比・特伦奇偷了我们4300万美金
Your man Bobby Trench stole 43 million of our dollars.

782
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,804
我们想要回来
We'd like it back.

783
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,929
因为本来就是我们的
Because it's our money.

784
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,924
因为这大逆不道啊
Because it's a blatant act of disrespect.

785
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,208
因为钱是我们的
And because it's our money.

786
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,560
你终于打来了 鲍比
Please tell me it's you, Bobby.

787
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,723
有斯蒂格的新资料吗?
Anything new on Stig?

788
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,645
我找到的所有资料都显示他是清白的
He's comin' up clean on every database I'm cleared for.

789
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,087
没有军方关系吗? 没有服役记录?
No military connection? No record of service?

790
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,811
要更深入调查 要得到杰瑟普的授权
To go deeper, I'd need to get clearance from Jessup.

791
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,239
试下找你在军队的老同事吧
Well, try your old contacts in the military.

792
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,004
我要把知道的一切都告诉杰瑟普
I'm gonna tell Jessup everything I know.

793
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,400
等下 你确定吗?
Wait, are you sure?

794
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,086
肯定会有人知道银行的钱是谁的
Someone has to know whose money was in the bank.

795
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,480
有啊 斯蒂格
Yeah. Stig.

796
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,239
斯蒂格连我是缉毒局的都不知道
Stig didn't even know I was DEA.

797
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,766
而且也有人在追杀他
Besides, somebody tried to kill him, too.

798
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,684
鲍比 让我帮你 你需要什么?
Bobby, let me help you. What do you need?

799
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,251
别着急 再见
Take it easy. Bye.

800
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,646
鲍比
Bobby.

801
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,001
去你的!
Fuck!

802
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,483
连一个人都拿不下 关门
That's how you take down a man. Now shut the door.

803
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,450
死就死吧
Just let it come.

804
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,688
罗伯特・林恩・特伦奇探员
Agent Robert Lynn Trench.

805
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,530
也叫鲍比・T 鲍比・B 鲍比・宾斯
A.k.a. Bobby T, a.k.a. Bobby B, a.k.a. Bobby Beans.

806
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,290
我们来聊聊吧
Let's have a chat.

807
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,079
你偷了4312.5万美金
You stole $43.125 million

808
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,321
这不属于你的
that did not belong to you.

809
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,084
实话实说
Now, man-to-man,

810
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,162
缉毒局里面谁指使你打劫我们银行的?
who at DEA authorized you to rob our bank?

811
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,565
你是银行家吗?
You a banker?

812
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,847
你玩过俄罗斯轮盘赌吗?
You ever play Russian roulette?

813
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,880
主要是
Thing is,

814
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,885
大多数人都把枪放在太阳穴上
most people put the gun to the temple.

815
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,043
那简直蠢到家了
Well, that's just stupid.

816
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,119
你在人家还有机会告诉你想知道的事之前
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

817
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,327
就把别人打死了
to tell you what you wanna know.

818
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,929
还弄的自己一身脏
Mess up your suit, too.

819
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,359
谁借你豹子胆来偷我们的钱的?
Who told you it was all right to take our money?

820
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,488
"你们的钱 你们的银行"
"Our money. Our bank."

821
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,081
你谁啊?
Who are ya?

822
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,568
你如果不知道我是谁
If you don't know who I am,

823
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,927
你怎么把4千3百万钱给偷走的?
how did you know to steal our 43 million?

824
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,844
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

825
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,650
- 你不知道  - 的确不知道
- You don't?  - No.

826
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,241
这样啊...
Well...

827
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,126
那钱哪儿去了?
Where's the money?

828
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,611
我的天啊
Oh, boy.

829
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,931
说实话...
Well, uh...

830
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,127
我可以担保 钱肯定不在这下面
it ain't down there, I can guarantee you that.

831
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,250
哇哦 哇哦
Whoo-hoo.

832
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,759
不愧外号 鲍比・蛋蛋
A.k.a. Bobby Balls.

833
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,285
干净利落 妥妥的
Clean and shaven.

834
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,010
你知道 你算什么吗?
You know what you are?

835
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,326
你
You

836
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,681
就是个变节的缉毒局条子
are a dirty DEA agent.

837
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,811
没错
That's right.

838
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,807
你就是个抢银行 杀上司的
You're a dirty DEA agent who robbed a bank.

839
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,485
变节缉毒局条子
And shot your boss.

840
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,801
不管你到哪个政府部门申诉
You walk into any federal office,

841
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,369
你都会得到这个结果
and that's the story they're gonna have.

842
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,406
要不然你就给我4312.5万美刀
Unless you bring me $43.125 million,

843
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,971
那你无债走人 轻松
and you walk away. Clean.

844
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,643
我跟你说清楚 讲明白了吗?
Have I properly incentivized you?

845
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,249
不能再明白了
More than you know.

846
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,202
除非你想老死在监狱里 不然的话 你最好搞定这事情
Unless you wanna rot in jail, you best get after it.

847
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,961
去吧 快去吧
Go on, now. Go on.

848
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,521
好吧
All right.

849
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,809
你觉得 他不是罪有应得吗?
You're thinkin' he deserved better?

850
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,480
你没感觉错
You're right.

851
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,531
嘿 鲁迪
Hey, Rudy.

852
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,445
好啊 哈维尔
Hola, Javier.

853
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,851
早啊 帕皮
Morning, Papi.

854
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,001

Don't move.

855
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,399
快进去
Go inside, quick.

856
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,401
老妈!
Mommy!

857
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,001
我们偷的钱 到底是谁的?
Whose money did we steal?

858
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,161
你真想知道?
You really wanna know?

859
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,845
我真想知道
I really wanna know.

860
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,599
别乱来 老家伙 进去 给我进去
Easy, old man, get in there. Get in there.

861
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,601
我到时候报复死你!
Payback's a bitch!

862
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,919
报复死你啊!
Payback's a bitch!

863
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,959
哦 哦 哦
Uh, uh, uh.

864
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,119
- 哇哦 鲍比  - 把枪放下 把钥匙给我
- Whoa, Bobby.  - Drop the gun. Give me the keys.

865
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,639
把钥匙给我 慢慢的来
Give me the keys. Nice and easy.

866
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,607
我做不到
I can't do that.

867
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,759
- 为什么?  - 我先抓到他的 先下手为强
- Why not?  - Well, I got him first. I got dibs.

868
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,319
我还抓这点44呢 帕皮我提走了 把钥匙给我
I got a .44. I'm taking Papi. Give me the keys.

869
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,641
你要钥匙? 你自己来拿
You want 'em? Come get 'em.

870
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,999
我看到那眼珠骨溜溜的转起来了
Now, I see the wheels turnin'.

871
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,119
你在想要不用蒙眼布 也许用牙齿好一点
You're thinkin' a little blindfold, maybe use your teeth.

872
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,407
我没想这东西 你知道我在想什么吗?
That's not what I'm thinkin'. You know what I'm thinkin'?

873
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,123
我了个草 伙计 这算什么?
Oh, shit, man. How's that?

874
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,884
打脸都不打声招呼
That was uncalled for.

875
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,279
操 我还是喜欢那个"很有门路"的鲍比
Shit. I liked you better when you were "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

876
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,959
那个鲍比还是个好人
That Bobby was a good guy.

877
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,039
我喜欢没事对女服务员眉来眼去
Well, I liked you better when you were winkin' at waitresses

878
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,759
枪扫鸡头的你
and shootin' the heads off of chickens.

879
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,603
把钥匙给我 把钥匙给我
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.

880
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,923
我操!
Shit!

881
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,082
- 你还会开枪的?  - 没错 把钥匙给我
- You saw that move comin'?  - That's correct. Give me the keys.

882
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,765
见了个鬼了 你还真倔啊
Damn, you're good.

883
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,040
反正总要有人弯腰捡钥匙的
Now, one of us is gonna have to pick up those keys.

884
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,046
- 你猜啊  - 好吧 我去捡 行了吧?
- Guess.  - All right. I'll get 'em, all right?

885
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,880
- 捡起来 捡起来  - 把钱移开点 伙计
- Get 'em, get 'em.  - Put that musket away, man.

886
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,489
- 嘿 停下来!  - 停下来?
- Hey, pull over!  - Pull over?

887
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,369
嘿 帕皮 你觉得我开车爽吗?
Hey, Papi, you like my drivin'?

888
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,526
我操!
Oh, shit!

889
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,887
你来啊 鲍比 我可没空整天陪你的啊!
Come on, Bobby, I ain't got all damn day!

890
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,526
你到底想干什么?
What do you wanna do?

891
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,567
哦!
Ow!

892
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,283
够了 够了 够了 放开我
All right. All right, all right. All right, let me go.

893
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,479
你先放开我
You let me go first.

894
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,527
不行 你放开我
No, you let me go.

895
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,291
数三下 一起放
On three. On three.

896
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,085
一 二 三
One. Two. Three.

897
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,919
看到没? 你现在给我不相信你的理由了
See? Now you're making me not be able to trust you.

898
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,524
说话算话 数三下 我们都放手
On the count of three, we'll let each other go.

899
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,919
- 好吗?  - 好吧 互不吃亏
- All right?  - All right. That's fair.

900
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,126
一 二
One. Two.

901
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,281

Three.

902
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,519
我就知道 放开我

903
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,759
- 不放!  - 那我放开你 我放你
- No!  - I'm gonna let you go. I'm gonna let you go.

904
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,046
- 好的  - 一...
- All right.  - One...

905
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,645
哦!
Ow!

906
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,247
哦!
Ow!

907
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,770
老实说 伙计 你不得不承认 这样够尽兴 对吧?
Come on, man. You gotta admit, that was kind of fun, no?

908
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,131
你不喜欢啊?
You didn't like that?

909
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,646
你到底是谁啊?
Who are you?

910
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,081
见鬼
Shit.

911
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,169
- 美国海军情报员  - 是吗?
- U.S. Navy Intel.  - Yeah?

912
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,560
起码我以前是
Or I was.

913
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,079
我的上级制造假象
My commander FUBARed my jacket.

914
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,159
说我捅了个宪兵后擅自失踪了
And now I'm AWOL after stabbing an MP.

915
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,767
你还算好的呢 他们诬陷我杀害上司
You're lucky. They got me framed for killing my boss.

916
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,281
那你上司派你最要好的四个朋友来干掉你吗?
Did your boss order your four closest friends to kill you?

917
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,210
没有 算你的狠
No, you got me there.

918
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,210
海军士官迈克尔・斯蒂格曼
Petty Officer Michael Stigman.

919
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,530
缉毒局探员鲍比・特伦奇 但我猜你早就知道了
DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but I guess you know that already.

920
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,681
荣幸荣幸
Pleasure.

921
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,199
那怎么说呢 是你碰巧遇上我的
So, what, you just happened to pick me,

922
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,168
还是上头派你来故意跟我对着干的?
or you got orders to set me up on purpose?

923
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,439
我有命在身啊 伙计 我也不知道你是缉毒局的人
I had orders, man. I didn't know you were DEA.

924
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,639
我的人知道 但他们情报局的
My people did. But they're Intel.

925
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,839
他们也不知道多少情况
There's not much they don't know.

926
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,079
你的人?
Your people?

927
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,319
我现在就想把事情搞清楚
Now I'm just trying to piece together the truth,

928
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,519
到时候越过我长官 直接跟海军司令汇报
so I can take it over my commander's head to the Admiral.

929
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,000
所以他们才想干掉我 所以我才想跟帕皮说清楚
That's why they wanna kill me and why I wanted to talk to Papi.

930
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,561
好吧
Right.

931
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,326
这样的话...
Well...

932
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,841
我觉得 我们可以一起去问他个清楚
I guess we can both talk to him at the same time.

933
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,199
什么 我们现在变搭档了?
What, like we're workin' together?

934
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,639
不是 我们才不是什么搭档
No, not like we're working together.

935
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,405
- 那才像话  - 不是 我们只是有交叉而已
- Yeah.  - No, like we're workin' in the same vicinity.

936
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,559
- 就是一起  - 调查的地方一样
- Together.  - In the same area code.

937
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,079
- 那就是一起  - 同一个郡而已
- Together.  - The same county.

938
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,082
别拿"四海一家"套我身上啊
And don't get all "We Are The World" on me either.

939
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,999
- 等这事完了 我要开枪还是会开枪的  - 但我们现在是搭档啦
- When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.  - But we're partners.

940
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,679
拜托 伙计 黑键白键不分开的
Come on, man, Ebony and Ivory.

941
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,728
见鬼 我觉得他吐死了 反正不是吐了就是死了
Shit, I think he puked. He's puked or he's dead.

942
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,525
哦没错 他吐了
Oh, yeah, he puked.

943
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,001
嘿
Hey.

944
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,519
我他妈到时候整死你们两个小崽子
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you both.

945
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,839
看样子要点时间啊
This might take a while.

946
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,330
伙计 我有时候陪你耗着
I got all day, partner.

947
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,719
等等
Hold on.

948
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,640
我送个香屁给你 妥妥的收下啊
Let me put that in there with ya. Put that on ya.

949
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,487
- 那...  - 搭档 你打算怎么来?
- So...  - Partner, how you wanna do this?

950
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,479
这话中听 特别是从你嘴里说出来
I like that, it's got a nice roll off your tongue there.

951
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,848
我们还没这么熟 别说得这么亲 保持距离
We're not that close. Don't kumbaya with me. Don't kumbaya.

952
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,119
我去拿水桶和毛巾 我们给这混蛋上上水刑
I'm gonna get my bucket and towel and waterboard his ass.

953
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,759
不了 我们给他个机会说清楚 你有什么要说的吗?
No, we gotta give him a chance to talk. You got anything to say?

954
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,879
但愿你们喜欢卵蛋的味道
I hope you guys like the taste of balls,

955
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,282
因为到时候我会把它们割下来 塞进你们嘴里
because I'm gonna chop yours off, stuff 'em in your mouths.

956
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,439
看到没有?
See?

957
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,808
也许到时候我换着塞
Or maybe I'll put yours in his and his in yours.

958
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,439
想我去拿水桶吗?
Want me to get the bucket?

959
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,601
速度拿来
Kumbaya.

960
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,961
为什么你在特雷司・克鲁塞斯存了这么多钱?
So why were you puttin' so much money in Tres Cruces?

961
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,885
因为那是特雷司・克鲁塞斯储贷公司
It's Tres Cruces.

962
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,891
我们以为你只存了一点钱在那里
We thought you just stashed a little cash there

963
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,850
抢劫后却发现了4千万 这怎么回事?
until we robbed the place, found 40 million. Why is that?

964
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,359
你们偷了特雷司・克鲁塞斯?
You robbed Tres Cruces?

965
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,799
没错 到底怎么回事?
That's correct. Why is that?

966
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,167
很好笑是吧 是吗?
That's funny, huh?

967
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,480
你死定了
You're dead.

968
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,559
- 没错 很好笑是吧 是吧?  - 你俩都死定了
- Yeah, that is funny, isn't it?  - You're both dead.

969
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,848
都不用我动手
And I didn't even have to kill you.

970
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,645
我还以为你是个聪明人 "很有门路"的鲍比
I thought you were sharp. "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

971
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,081
可你呢...
But you...

972
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,529
你抢的是中情局的钱
You just ripped off the CIA.

973
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,811
中情局?
The CIA?

974
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,439
中情局?
The CIA.

975
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,879
满嘴胡言 中情局存钱的银行 他插一脚干嘛?
He's full of crap. Why would he have money in the same bank as the CIA?

976
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,999
你干嘛要把钱存在中情局存钱的银行里?
Why would you have money in the same bank as the CIA?

977
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,331
那银行里 我没存一分钱
I don't have shit in that bank.

978
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,479
我在特雷司・克鲁塞斯存的唯一一笔钱
The only money I deliver to Tres Cruces

979
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,562
- 是一笔付款  - 付给中情局的?
- is a payment.  - To the CIA?

980
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,046
给中情局 他们从我收入中抽7%
The CIA. They take 7% of my revenue.

981
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,119
作为回报 他们让我用他们的飞机
In return, they let me use their planes

982
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,770
把我的货带出边境
so I can get my shit across the border.

983
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,321
我本来有更便宜的方法 可是他们说了算
I could do it a lot cheaper, but there was really no negotiations.

984
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,521
你知道吗...
You know...

985
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,727
他们收所有党派的贿赂
They take it from all the cartels.

986
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,520
胡说八道
Bullshit.

987
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,921
就算这样
Okay.

988
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,051
他们还是要干掉你俩的
They're still gonna kill you.

989
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,486
鲍比?
Bobby?

990
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,004
你说 想来就来的
You said stop by anytime.

991
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,159
- 你绑架了一个大毒枭  - 没错
- You kidnapped a drug kingpin! -That's correct.

992
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,004
帕皮・格雷科! 你还把他捆在我车库里!
Papi Greco! And you tied him up in my garage!

993
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,440
你介意我那个酸奶喝吗?
You mind if I swipe a yogurt?

994
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,079
没事 拿吧 想拿什么拿什么 全部拿走最好
Yeah, sure. Please. Help yourself to anything. Take whatever you want.

995
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,279
就一罐酸奶而已
It's just a yogurt.

996
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,805
但是她的酸奶 放回去吧
But it's her yogurt. Just put it back.

997
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,207
求你了
Please.

998
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,559
你们两个是前男女朋友吗?
Are you two like ex-boyfriend and girlfriend?

999
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,119
实际上 怎么说呢? 我们从来没认真谈过
Actually, you know what? We never put a name on it.

1000
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,039
那结果呢 你伤他的心 还是他伤了你的心?
So, what, you broke his heart or he broke yours?

1001
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,964
哇哦 这家伙真是口无遮拦 随便乱问啊
Wow, this guy will really ask anyone anything at anytime.

1002
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,879
要不你去看看帕皮的情况 好吗?
Why don't you go and check on Papi, huh?

1003
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,001
你看上这男人什么了?
What do you see in this guy?

1004
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,559
我可以说上好几小时 但我不认识你
I could go on for hours, but I don't know you,

1005
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,079
我也不觉得我们现在应该
and I don't think this is the right time

1006
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,605
谈论这种话题 懂了吗?
for us to have this conversation, okay?

1007
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,519
所以是恋父情节啦 啊?
So daddy issues, huh?

1008
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,567
老爸!
Daddy!

1009
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,891
滚去车库 盯着帕皮 速度滚
Garage. Papi. Go.

1010
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,850
- 我现在看明白了  - 速度滚 滚去车库
- I get it now.  - Go. Go to the garage.

1011
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,446
- 我能拿这罐酸奶吗?  - 你拿去好了 拿着
- Can I have the yogurt?  - You can have the yogurt. Here.

1012
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,679
- 我不喜欢她 伙计  - 没你的事
- I don't like her, man.  - You don't get a vote.

1013
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,841
我替你盯着她
I'm gonna watch her.

1014
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,084
鲍比 你到底在干什么?
Bobby. What are you doing?

1015
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,688
你完全确定 你能相信那家伙吗?
Are you 100% sure you can trust this guy?

1016
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,162
不能 但他是我能找到唯一的帮手了
No. But he's all the help I got.

1017
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,041
杰瑟普死了
Jessup's dead.

1018
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,166
我们偷的是中情局的钱 他们会找上门的
The money we stole was CIA money. They came lookin' for it.

1019
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,644
对不起 黛比 我不是故意把你拖下水的
I'm sorry, Deb, I didn't mean to get you involved in all this.

1020
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,441
你没事吧?
You okay?

1021
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,130
你在笑什么呢?
What are you smirking at?

1022
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,319
你知道吗 我一直挖空心思
You know, I've been racking my brain

1023
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,970
想知道你长什么样子的
trying to figure out who you look like.

1024
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,690
现在我终于看清楚了
And it finally dawned on me.

1025
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,440
你就像墨西哥版的阿尔伯特・爱因斯坦
You look like a Mexican Albert Einstein.

1026
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,528
就差点他的智商 这明显的
Minus the genius factor, obviously.

1027
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,125
你要点酸奶吗?
You want some yogurt?

1028
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,246
报复死你俩
Payback's a bitch.

1029
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,206
这拳替小托罗打的
That's for Little Toro.

1030
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,001
斯蒂格
Stig.

1031
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,087
斯蒂格!
Stig!

1032
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,679
打包走人!
Pack it up!

1033
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,681

Move it, move it!

1034
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,364

1035
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,559
是你的人吗?
That your people?

1036
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,800
你一定要这么说吗?
Do you have to say it like that?

1037
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,485
怎么说了? 他们是你的人 对吧?
Like what? They're your people, right?

1038
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,120
严格说 是的 但现在只有你是我的人了
Technically, yes, but I thought you were my people now.

1039
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,359
好了 数两下 我们就冲进车库 数了啊
All right, two taps, we'll hit the garage. On go.

1040
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,089
- 好的 你数吧  - 动手!
- Okay. On your go.  - Go!

1041
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,287
操
Fuck.

1042
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,519
这什么情况?
What was that about?

1043
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,681
那是一通乱打
That was messed up.

1044
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,999
到底什么情况?
What the hell is going on?

1045
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,126
我不知道
I don't know.

1046
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,931
我也不知道
I don't know.

1047
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,685
把手机给我 快点
Give me your phone, now.

1048
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,919
车子我也要了 出来 出来!
I'll take the car, too. Get out. Get out!

1049
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,967
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1050
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,922
他在辆灰色车上
Está en un gray Charger.

1051
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,962
斯蒂格的人怎么知道来你家里找我们的?
How did Stig's people know to come to your house?

1052
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,359
我不知道 他们肯定是跟踪你们了
I don't know. They must have followed you.

1053
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,479
我不觉得
I don't think so.

1054
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,839
跟踪的话 我们会发现他们的
We would have seen 'em.

1055
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,841
他们肯定发现他们的
We should have seen 'em.

1056
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,842
他们怎么知道来你家的?
How'd they know to come to your house?

1057
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,327
啊?
Hmm?

1058
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,559
为什么他们来你家了 黛比?
Why were they at your house, Debbie?

1059
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,891
不是吧 你真的假的?
No. You serious?

1060
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,081
鲍比...
Bobby...

1061
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,610
出去 麻利点
Out of the car, gabacho.

1062
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,841
快点
Hurry up.

1063
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,003
你现在完了吧
You fucked up now, I see.

1064
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,726
跪下
On your knees.

1065
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,082
不止你有门路的 鲍比
I know some guys, too, Bobby.

1066
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,682
把他们绑起来 带回去再说
Bag 'em up. Let's take 'em home.

1067
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,359
- 你想谈谈吗?  - 不用
- Do you wanna talk about it?  - No.

1068
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,850
- 你确定?  - 我确定
- You sure?  - Yeah, I'm sure.

1069
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,199
我说了 我不喜欢她 伙计
I told you I didn't like her, man.

1070
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,281
闭嘴
Shut up.

1071
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,839
你干嘛对我这么态度啊?
What are you gettin' mad at me for?

1072
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,159
因为你废话太多了
Because you talk too much.

1073
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,199
我对你怎么过了啊?
What'd I ever do to you?

1074
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,725
除了朝我开枪吗?
Besides shoot me?

1075
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,119
你知道你是什么吗? 你就是费青
You know what you are? You're a misanthorpe.

1076
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,799
是愤青 我也是个费青
It's misanthrope. I'm a misanthrope.

1077
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,039
你知道我说的哪个词吗?
Did you know what I meant to say?

1078
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,599
不知道 你想说哪个?
No. What did you mean to say?

1079
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,443
- 就是你看谁都不顺眼  - 闭嘴
- That you don't like people.  - Shut up.

1080
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,239
该我松松筋骨了
Time for my massage.

1081
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,084
我会替你收拾床的
Yeah. I'll have housekeeping clean up your bed.

1082
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,686
靠
Oh, shit.

1083
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,759
我爷爷砍了三十年甘蔗 手上从来没出过一个水泡
My grandfather cut cane for 30 years every day and never got a blister.

1084
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,928
太难闻了
Says it smells like hell,

1085
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,204
不过能让手变得坚韧
toughens the hands.

1086
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,999
知道现在我最喜欢什么?
You know what I like about this?

1087
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,209
我不光能和你俩待在一起
Not only do I get to take my time with you guys,

1088
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,961
而且这次不必再担心留下把柄
but this time, I don't have to worry about leaving any marks.

1089
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,964
别用你的手碰我
Don't put your hands on me, man.

1090
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,402
- 靠  - 你说什么?
- Shit.  - What did you say?

1091
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,927
别拿你那脏手碰我
Just don't put those pissy hands on me, man.

1092
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,681
你无家可归了 鲍比
You ain't got a home, Bobby.

1093
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,439
缉毒局不再需要你
DEA doesn't want you around.

1094
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,601
因为你犯了罪
Not with your sins.

1095
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,119
我到时候报复死你!
Payback's a bitch.

1096
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,088
你闻起来像臭虫 伙计
You smell like warm Corona, man.

1097
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,520
还记得我的牛吧
You remember my prize breeding bull.

1098
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,685
它的蛋和椰子一样大
With cojones the size of coconuts.

1099
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,286
想见见不?
You wanna see him?

1100
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,010
不用了 我们在这看就挺好的
No, it's okay. We can see good from here.

1101
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,451
拜拜 鲍比
Adiós, Bobby.

1102
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,721
别
No, no.

1103
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,526
靠
Shit!

1104
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,961
4300万美元!
43 million!

1105
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,599
我们就从CIA那偷了这么多
It's everything we stole from the CIA.

1106
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,319
放了我们 我们把钱给你
You let us go, we'll bring it to you.

1107
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,321
钱在我这
I got the money.

1108
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,039
- 你说啥?  - 钱在我这
- What are you talking about?  - I got it.

1109
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,199
- 钱不在你这!  - 我当然知道 可他不知道
- You don't have it!  - I know I don't have it. He doesn't know that.

1110
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,399
可钱不在你手里
But you don't have the money.

1111
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,079
我知道钱不在你那 因为在我这
I know you don't have it, 'cause I have it.

1112
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,199
在你那? 哪儿?
You have it? Well, where is it?

1113
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,167
昆西司令的保险箱里
Commander Quince's safe.

1114
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,561
- 库帕斯克里斯蒂市 海军航空基地  - 别跟我说 跟他说
- Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.  - Don't tell me. Tell him.

1115
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,486
靠!
Oh, shit!

1116
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,801
钱在哪?
Where is it?

1117
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,527
在库帕斯克里斯蒂市 海军航空基地! 昆西司令的保险柜里!
Commander Quince's safe! Corpus Christi Naval Air Station!

1118
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,359
他就这么侮辱我们 你居然还问要不要告诉他
The guy's pissing on us, and you're askin' if we should fuckin' tell him.

1119
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,409
就算你说的是真的 没准我现在也弄死你们
If that's the truth, I might as well just kill you now.

1120
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,886
把我女儿带到别的房间去

1121
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,049
我正在追查两个从你那出来的家伙
I had a run-in with a couple boys out of your organization.

1122
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,521
你好啊 厄尔
Hello, Earl.

1123
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,844
鲍比・宾斯先生和迈克尔・斯蒂格曼先生
Mr. Bobby Beans and Mr. Michael Stigman.

1124
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,084
他们不是我的人
Well, they're not from my organization.

1125
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,004
他们自己单干
They're freelancers.

1126
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,886
鲍比・宾斯是缉毒局的间谍
And Bobby Beans is undercover DEA.

1127
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,961
斯蒂格曼先生是擅离职守的美国海军
And Mr. Stigman's AWOL U.S. Navy.

1128
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,759
他们从特雷司・克鲁塞斯储贷公司偷了4312.5万美元
They stole 43.125 million from the Tres Cruces.

1129
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,239
我们想要回来
We want it back.

1130
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,719
我有什么好处?
Is there a finder's fee?

1131
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,519
我们继续让你做生意
Fee is we let you continue to do business.

1132
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,205
我们不会把费用从7%提升到20%
Fee is we don't raise our cut from 7% to 20.

1133
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,679
我们也不会派一支阿帕奇A-6直升机小队来把你炸的渣都不剩
The fee is we don't come down here with a squad of Apache A-6 helicopters

1134
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,409
这就是你的好处
and wipe you off the face of the earth.

1135
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,043
你希望我的国家脆弱而堕落
You like my country weak and corrupt, don't you?

1136
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,366
所以你能在商场里买到便宜的垃圾
So you can buy your cheap crap at the mall.

1137
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,929
不过 厄尔 我可不便宜
Well, Earl, I'm not cheap.

1138
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,048
你在跟我玩傲气吗?
Is this about pride, Manny?

1139
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,479
彰显男子气概吗?
About machismo?

1140
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,721
想要证明你有个巨大的墨西哥?
Prove you got a big Mexican cock?

1141
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,079
不得不说 你的湃肥荡
Well, your cock is huge. It's massive.

1142
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,084
而且我很敬畏
And I, I'm in awe of your cock.

1143
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,885
可那又如何? 你还不是个毒贩
So what? You're still a drug dealer.

1144
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,204
而我依旧是美国政府的一员
And I'm still the government of the United States.

1145
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,570
市场是自由的 曼尼
It's a free market, Manny.

1146
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,885
可并不是全世界都如此
Not a free world.

1147
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,159
我会想想看
I'll take a look.

1148
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,288
你会很为难的!
Hard! You'll look hard.

1149
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,290
在墨西哥混向来如此
Under every rock in Mexico.

1150
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,969
离开这鬼地方
Let's get out of this shithole.

1151
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,769
把鸡笼里那俩蠢货放了

1152
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,500
如果那白人确实是美国海军 我们没准能赚4300万美元

1153
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,345
那你中情局的朋友怎么办?

1154
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,669
让他回家吃屎去吧

1155
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,369
我喜欢这个 老大

1156
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,169
我决定让你们去给我带回那4300万美元
I've decided to let you bring me the 43 million.

1157
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,399
卡车会带你们向北到边境
The truck'll take you north to the border.

1158
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,439
到那以后 你们就得和偷渡者们一起步行穿越国境
From there, you'll cross on foot with the coyotes.

1159
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,726
如果一直是这样的话 我们愿意来开车
If it's all the same, we'd rather drive.

1160
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,879
现在人人都在找你们
With everybody lookin' for you,

1161
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,279
如果开车 他们会在两秒内把你干掉
they'd pull you out of line in two seconds.

1162
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,611
所以你们得步行 像我们的人民被迫偷渡一样
No, you go the way you force my people.

1163
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,119
如果我们不能冒险穿过边境
If we can't risk crossing,

1164
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,359
我们怎么把钱给你带回来
how are we supposed to bring you back the money?

1165
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,601
我在北边境等你们24小时
I'll meet you north of the border in 24 hours.

1166
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,642
现在 我相信你们不会再讨价还价了
Now, I'm trusting you to fulfill your part of the bargain.

1167
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,201
喂 鲍比
Hey, Bobby.

1168
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,570
你有24小时把钱给我带来
You got 24 hours to bring me the money.

1169
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,523
否则我会在她脑袋上开个洞
Or I'm gonna shoot her right in the head.

1170
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,599
然后我会找到你
Then I'm gonna find you,

1171
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,762
把你像猪一样开膛破肚
and I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

1172
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,921
斯蒂格!
Stig!

1173
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,368
这些都结束以后 我还是会一枪崩了你
When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.

1174
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,244
尽管来 鲍比
Whatever it takes, Bobby.

1175
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,479
随便挑一辆 我都能弄来
Pick one. I can get in anything.

1176
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,879
那辆奥迪怎么样?
So, what about the Audi?

1177
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,799
不 德国车可不行 锁太复杂 各种警报
No, I don't do German, okay? Locks are tricky, too many alarms.

1178
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,325
好吧 雪佛兰厢车怎么样?
Okay. Suburban?

1179
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,639
那是2010款
That one's 2010.

1180
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,881
2英里耗一加仑油 我可不想付那么多油钱
It's gonna get like two miles a gallon. I ain't payin' for all that gas.

1181
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,764
作为一个偷车贼 你还真是挑剔
For a car thief, you are mighty particular.

1182
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,121
我准备弄那辆本田
I'll break into the Honda.

1183
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,759
你看我能和你挤进一辆本田吗?
I look like I'm gonna ride in that Honda to you?

1184
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,919
你可以的
You could.

1185
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,559
那你应该选一辆经典的
And you could pick somethin' with a little more class.

1186
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,959
不是我多嘴 我们要闯的可是
I hate to remind you, but we're breakin'

1187
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,239
高度戒备的海军基地
onto a high-security Navy base.

1188
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,479
不是嘻哈剧院
We ain't goin' to the hip-hop opera.

1189
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,159
今晚可没有悲惨世界给你看
It ain't no Les Misérables for you tonight.

1190
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,161
悲惨世界!
Les Misérables!

1191
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,399
随便
Oh, man, whatever the fuck, man.

1192
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,479
不用提醒我
Don't remind me.

1193
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,159
昆西把钱带到基地可不是我的错
Look, it's not my fault Quince took the money back to the base.

1194
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,799
我以为是你把钱带回基地
I thought you said you took the money back to the base.

1195
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,165
我从没说过
No, I never said that.

1196
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,759
那钱有可能在任何地方
So the money could be anywhere.

1197
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,679
可能在东加毕普 在开曼岛
It could be in East Jabip, the Cayman Islands...

1198
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,159
不 钱就在基地 好吗?
No, the money is on the base, okay?

1199
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,999
我在卡米诺瑞尔把钱给了昆西司令
I gave it to Commander Quince at the Camino Real,

1200
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,519
然后他让那哥们把钱带回基地
and he told the guys to take it back to the base.

1201
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,648
然后他就想弄死你
Right before he took you out and tried to kill you.

1202
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,199
那不代表把钱藏基地是故意骗我的
That doesn't mean he's lyin' about the base.

1203
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,359
不是所有人都和你一样偏执 鲍比
Not everybody's as paranoid as you, Bobby. Jeez.

1204
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,681
那辆普锐斯怎么样? 你喜欢不?
What about the Prius? You like the Prius?

1205
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,806
卡米诺瑞尔
Camino Real.

1206
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,160
没错 是个酒店
Yeah, it's a hotel.

1207
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,479
我在卡米诺瑞尔遇见了黛比
I met Debbie at the Camino Real.

1208
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,481
真的假的
No shit?

1209
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,840
- 真的  - 她在那干嘛?
- Yeah.  - What was she doin' there?

1210
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,040
她说她去那看她男友哈维
She said she was there to meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

1211
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,199
等等 你的女朋友还有个男友?
Wait. Your girlfriend has a boyfriend?

1212
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,531
她不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

1213
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,601
我的天
Holy shit.

1214
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,566
赶紧挑辆车吧
Yeah, just pick a car.

1215
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,486
就它了
Right here.

1216
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,281
就这个?
You picked that one?

1217
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,401
没错
Yeah.

1218
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,804
你还想要啥 宾利?
Fuck you want, a fuckin' Bentley?

1219
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,406
我来吧
I got it.

1220
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,484
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hey.

1221
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,931
有个问题
Crazy question,

1222
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,851
你这有人能修雪地摩托吗?
you wouldn't have anybody knows how to fix a snowmobile?

1223
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,001
貌似没有
I don't think so.

1224
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,519
能不能帮我查一下? 今晚之前就得修好
Would you check for me? I really need it fixed by tonight.

1225
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,931
怎么? 有暴风雪要来?
Why, a big storm coming?

1226
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,969
谁都不确定它不会来
You never can be too sure.

1227
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,241
我去去就来
I'll be right back.

1228
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,525
- 你咋了?  - 什么咋了?
- Up with that?  - What?

1229
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,648
她冲你笑 你居然没冲她挤眼睛
She smiled at you, you didn't wink at her?

1230
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,723
我可不会冲每一个我看见的女人抛媚眼
I don't wink at every woman I see.

1231
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,487
德克萨斯的雪地摩托? 看来你要动真格的了
Snowmobile in Texas, huh? You must be in some serious shit, sailor.

1232
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,000
你给自己弄了个新爪子
You got yourself a new claw, huh?

1233
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,242
- 来碰个拳  - 挺好看
- Gimme claw. Give it a pound.  - It's a beaut.

1234
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,164
你这还有我的应急储备吗?
You still got my rainy-day stash?

1235
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,446
当然
Yeah.

1236
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,771
回见 斯蒂格
See ya later, Stig.

1237
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,041
好的
All right.

1238
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,439
知道人们怎么说吗 小声说话然后带上M-4和榴弹发射器
You know what they say, talk softly and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

1239
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,726
喔
Wow.

1240
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,451
你要哪个?
Which one you want?

1241
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,880
这个
This one.

1242
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,724
你有进入基地的计划了吗?
What's your plan for gettin' on the base?

1243
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,087
正在想
I'm workin' on it.

1244
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,599
记住 我们到了指挥楼以后
Remember, once we get to the command building,

1245
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,279
昆西的办公室在一楼走廊的最后
Quince's office is first floor, end of the hall.

1246
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,439
如果他不在训练场的话 他每天在那住18小时
If he's not in the field, that's where he lives 18 hours a day.

1247
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,885
好的 可你还没告诉我
Right, right. But you still haven't told me

1248
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,639
你有什么计划能让咱穿过这道门
what the plan is to get through the gate.

1249
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,166
我有计划 我是说 我肯定能想到计划
I got a plan. I mean, I'm capable of comin' up with a plan.

1250
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,359
我可没说你想不到
I'm not sayin' you're not capable,

1251
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,771
我是说你还没告诉我 到底是什么
I'm just sayin' you haven't told me. What is it?

1252
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,370
我在想
I'm workin' on it.

1253
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,846
最好想快点
Better work faster.

1254
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,081
再快点
Much faster.

1255
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,319
往前 快点
Move it up. Quickly.

1256
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,321
靠
Fuck it.

1257
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,927
停下!
Halt!

1258
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,491
他要闯进去!
He's going through!

1259
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,845
这够快了不?
That fast enough for ya?

1260
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,081
靠
Shit!

1261
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,248
我们上! 电台联系!
Let's go! Let's go! On the radio now!

1262
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,486
回标杆那去!
Return to post!

1263
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,119
这就是你的计划?
That was your plan?

1264
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,319
反正我们已经进来了
Well, we're on the base, aren't we?

1265
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,279
这不能叫计划 脑子正常的人都不会闯进一个海军基地
That's not a plan. Nobody in their right mind breaks into a naval base.

1266
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,039
这就是计划的高明之处 没人能预料到
That's why it's a brilliant plan. No one expected it.

1267
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,079
你应该看看你的表情 他们都和你一样震惊了
You shoulda seen your face. Damn, they were surprised.

1268
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,719
你等会下车 我来当诱饵把他们引开
Your stop comin' up. I'll play decoy,

1269
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,319
然后去找上将 怎么样?
lead 'em away, try to get to the Admiral, okay?

1270
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,926
好的 如果出了问题 我们在船坞的院子里见
All right. Things go wrong, I'll see you back at the boat yard.

1271
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,201
不会出问题的
Things ain't goin' wrong.

1272
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,523
我可以的 我去找上将 我能行 看好
I'm gettin' a medal. I get to the Admiral, I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

1273
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,120
你会祝我好运的对吧?
You're gonna wish me luck, aren't ya?

1274
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,799
- 说啊!  - 祝你好运
- Come on, man, let's hear it!  - Good luck.

1275
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,399
昆西的办公室在走廊尽头
Quince's office at the end of the hall.

1276
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,721
记住 一楼 走廊尽头!
Remember, first floor, end of the hall!

1277
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,323
停下! 不许动!
Halt! Stop where you are!

1278
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,079
指挥楼有情况!
We have a breach at Status Hall!

1279
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,120
快!
Go, go, go, go!

1280
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,885
上楼!
Up the stairs!

1281
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,044
长官 士官迈克尔・斯蒂格曼报道 ID号540333
Sir, Petty Officer Michael Stigman, ID number 540333.

1282
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,561
等等 出什么问题了?
Wait a minute, what's the problem?

1283
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,962
对不住 我也不想这么做的
Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that to you, man.

1284
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,807
长官
Sir.

1285
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,327
我服役12年
I've been in service 12 years.

1286
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,639
从来没有踏进过长官食堂 更别提闯进来了
I've never stepped foot in an officers' mess, much less crashed it.

1287
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,130
真的 长官 紧急情况
Please, sir, it's an emergency.

1288
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,325
去外边等着
Stand outside, please.

1289
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,368
- 都出去吧  - 谢谢 长官
- Leave us alone.  - Thank you, sir.

1290
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,919
真对不住
Hey, I'm really sorry about that, man.

1291
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,239
我确实没想打你来着 我道歉
I didn't mean to hit you like that. I apologize.

1292
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,599
说吧 士官 坐
I'm listening, sailor. Sit.

1293
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,806
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

1294
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,040
- 接着帮我拨将军的电话  - 是 长官
- Try the Admiral again for me.  - Yes, sir.

1295
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,919
你相信这些偷出来的钱
And you believed this stolen money

1296
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,844
可被用来打击毒品团伙?
would all be used to fight drug cartels?

1297
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,731
是的 长官 我认为结果取决于有效的指挥
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came down the valid chain of command.

1298
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,763
愚忠非忠
Blind loyalty is not loyalty.

1299
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,600
我明白 长官 这就是我来这的原因
I know that, sir, and that's why I'm here.

1300
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,799
你能到这来告诉我这个说明你胆子很大
Well, you've shown a lot of tenacity

1301
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,450
也很有韧性
and a lot of guts bringing this to me.

1302
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,802
谢谢 长官 因为您能挽救这一切
Thank you, sir. That means the world comin' from you.

1303
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,530
不幸的是对这事我无能为力
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you.

1304
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,959
当然可以 长官 您只需关闭基地
Of course, sir. I mean, you can just lock down the base.

1305
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,200
可以逮捕昆西司令
You can arrest Commander Quince.

1306
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,204
美国海军不会抢银行
The United States Navy does not rob banks.

1307
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,362
我们的人从来没有抢过银行
Its personnel did not rob a bank.

1308
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,167
我不会因为一个坏士兵而玷污美国海军的正直形象
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1309
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,999
如果银行丢了钱
If there was money taken from the bank

1310
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,970
那肯定是不合法的中情局的破基金的钱
that was part of an illegal CIA slush fund,

1311
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,600
而海军根本就不知道这个基金的存在
the Navy had no knowledge the fund existed.

1312
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,039
你的档案还是六个月的擅离职守?
Your jacket has you six months AWOL?

1313
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,041
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

1314
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,129
那它一直都会这样了
It's gonna stay that way.

1315
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,410
昆西司令的档案也会被修改成擅离职守
Commander Quince's jacket will likewise be amended so he's also AWOL,

1316
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,847
这样就不会是海军的问题了
making none of this the Navy's problem.

1317
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,208
长官 这么做不对
Sir, this isn't right.

1318
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,044
我可以提供更多
Well, I'd offer more,

1319
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,679
但是当手臂已经坏疽
but when the hand has gangrene,

1320
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,682
断臂才能活命
you chop it off to save the body.

1321
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:48,331
你不能因为它本来是好的就一直留着
You don't keep the pinkie around just because it meant well.

1322
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,720
把士官斯蒂格曼请出大门外边去
Have Petty Officer Stigman dropped outside the main gate.

1323
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,811
要是他再走进世界上任何一个军事基地
He sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world,

1324
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,530
毙了他
I want him shot.

1325
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,879
全是扯淡
This is bullshit.

1326
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,201
士兵听从你这样的人的命令去战斗至死
You know, men like me fight and die on the orders of men like you!

1327
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,204
没有我们 你肩膀上的星星就是戏服!
Without us, those stars on your shoulder are a fucking costume!

1328
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,921
打开保险箱
Open the safe.

1329
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,079
你老大知道你在这吗?
Does your boss know you're doin' this?

1330
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,199
打开
Open it.

1331
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,521
还是中情局把她杀了 就像他们杀了杰瑟普
Or did the CIA kill her like they did Jessup?

1332
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,799
和你有什么关系?
What's it to you?

1333
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,881
我不喜欢模糊的结局
I don't like loose ends.

1334
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,047
我也不喜欢
Neither do I...

1335
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,407
哈维
Harvey.

1336
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,481
是吧?
Huh?

1337
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,003
我妈叫我霍华德
Well, my mother named me Harold.

1338
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,601
我觉得哈维更好听
I like Harvey. Harvey has a nice ring to it.

1339
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,530
你不喜欢哈维?
Don't you like Harvey?

1340
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,240
- 我不知道你在说什么  - 你当然知道
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.  - Yes, you do.

1341
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,642
最近去过卡米诺瑞尔酒店吧?
Been to the Camino Real Hotel lately?

1342
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,926
打开保险箱
Open the safe.

1343
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,959
集结地已就绪
Staging area cleared up!

1344
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,081
可以通过!
Bring it through!

1345
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,201
钱在哪?
Where's the money?

1346
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,730
你先告诉我黛比在哪
You tell me where Deb is.

1347
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,526
她在做指甲 钱在哪?
She's gettin' her nails done. Where is the money?

1348
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,006
我不知道
I don't know.

1349
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,883
好了 现在告诉我你所做的
All right, tell me what you do know.

1350
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,599
你女朋友和我
Well, your girl found out where the CIA

1351
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,919
同时发现了中情局藏钱的地方
was stashing the money right about when I did.

1352
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,319
当我告诉她
And when I told her

1353
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,599
我俩可以陷害你和斯蒂格曼然后带着钱远走高飞的时候
that she and I could get away with the money by setting you and Stigman up,

1354
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,726
她连眼睛都没眨一下
she didn't even blink.

1355
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,519
别骗我
Don't lie to me.

1356
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,682
她和你在一起就那么不开心?
Was she that unhappy, Bobby?

1357
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,725
钱在哪? 别骗我
Where is the money? Don't lie to me.

1358
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,651
你和斯蒂格曼还活着 你觉得我会把钱放这?
You think I'd keep it here with you and Stigman still alive?

1359
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,285
别傻了 鲍比
Come on, Bobby.

1360
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,843
你把钱给她了 是吗?
You gave it to her, didn't you?

1361
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,840
是吗?
Didn't you?

1362
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,442
将军 向后退
Commander. Back up.

1363
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,970
- 快快快!  - 在你们六点钟方向!
- Go, go, go, go!  - On your six!

1364
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,571
快 快 快
Move, move, move!

1365
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,886
所有人员从大厦内撤离
All personnel evacuate the building.

1366
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,243
所有人员从大厦内撤离
All personnel evacuate the building.

1367
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,079
看住后门 在草丛里!
Take the back, in that alley!

1368
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,520
去前门! 我们走!
Go to the front! Let's go!

1369
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,119
闪开点!
Hey!

1370
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,770
这边! 行动!
This way! Move!

1371
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,884
快点 跟上! 我们得找到他!
Come on, come on! Find him!

1372
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,927
没有发现!
Clear!

1373
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,641
没有发现!
Clear!

1374
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,721
你还好吗?
You Okay?

1375
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,370
快点起来 我们走
Come on, let's go.

1376
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,368
还好吗 先生? 是的 我没事
You okay, sir? Yeah, I'm fine.

1377
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,083
他从下水管逃走了
Work off the standpipe!

1378
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,080
这烧烤做的真不错
This is really good barbecue.

1379
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,326
你肯定想尝尝吧
You don't want to regret not tryin' it.

1380
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,044
为什么你还在这浪费时间不直接杀了我呢?
Why don't you stop wasting my time and just kill me?

1381
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,881
就算鲍比带着钱来了
Even if Bobby was coming with the money,

1382
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,968
你还是会把我们都杀了吧
you'd still kill us both.

1383
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,686
但是他不会来了
But he's not coming.

1384
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,168
- 他会来的  - 不会了
- He'll be here.  - No.

1385
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,281
他不会来了
He won't.

1386
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,327
你觉得他会不管你死活吗?
You think he's just gonna let you die?

1387
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,208
你觉得海军跑到我家来找鲍比是巧合吗?
You think it was a coincidence the Navy came looking for Bobby at my house?

1388
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,126
如果不是鲍比 至少我已经拿到4300万的一半
If I couldn't have Bobby, at least I'd have half of 43 million.

1389
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,607
是你给鲍比・宾斯下的套
You set up Bobby Beans.

1390
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,088
不然我也不会来找你的
I wouldn't be coming for you either.

1391
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,720
钱在哪里?
Where's the money?

1392
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,008
别傻了 我也不知道
Come on. I don't know.

1393
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,730
钱已经汇到国外了
Gone, outta the country.

1394
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,360
肯定不在海军总部 帕皮
It's certainly not on a Navy base, Papi.

1395
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,409
那里都给了你什么?
Where does that leave you?

1396
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,367
给了我应得的
Exactly where I deserve to be.

1397
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,205
- 是我  - 鲍比
- Yeah.  - Bobby.

1398
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,571
你迟到了
You're late.

1399
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,166
我拿到钱了
I got the money.

1400
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,049
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

1401
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,247
我这次真的拿到了
No, I got it.

1402
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,403
相信我 我真的拿到钱了 我这就拿来给你
Believe me, I got it. I'll bring it to you.

1403
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,970
你在哪里?
Where are you?

1404
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,891
嗨 鲍比
Hi, Bobby.

1405
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,326
黛比?
Debbie?

1406
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,201
他能听到我们说话吗?
Can he hear us?

1407
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,529
挂了电话快逃
Just hang up the phone and run.

1408
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,045
好的 听我说
Okay, listen to me.

1409
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,044
告诉他我拿到钱了
Tell him I got the money.

1410
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,571
快挂电话
Hang up the phone.

1411
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,599
不是你的错 只是...
It's not your fault. Just...

1412
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,601
黛比
Debbie.

1413
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,724
告诉他我拿到钱了 好吗?
Tell him I have the money. Okay?

1414
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,764
而且我知道钱在哪里
And I know you know where the money is.

1415
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,361
一定要告诉他我拿到了
Just tell him I have it.

1416
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,485
黛比 听我说
Debbie, listen to me.

1417
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,131
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1418
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,009
我真的很爱你
I really meant to love you.

1419
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,446
黛比
Debbie.

1420
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,610
黛比 你在哪儿? 黛比 你在哪?
Where are you? Debbie, where are you?

1421
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,402
黛比告诉我你在哪儿?
Where are you? Debbie?

1422
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,926
你还在听吗?
Hello?

1423
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,407
还在吗?
Hello?

1424
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,841
还在吗?
Hello?

1425
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,805
黛比 听我说? 嗯...
Hello? Debbie? Uh...

1426
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,481
再等一分钟 我拿到钱了
Wait a minute, I got the money.

1427
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,199
他们怎么说? 海军上将怎么说?
What'd they say? What'd the Admiral say?

1428
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,119
上将能怎么说? 上将已经把自己撇的干干净净了
What'd the Admiral say? Admiral washed his hands of the whole thing.

1429
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,439
海军完全坐视不理
Navy turned their back.

1430
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,680
那钱呢?
Where's the money?

1431
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,679
没有钱了 斯蒂格
There was no money, Stig.

1432
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,479
什么? 没钱了
What? There was no money.

1433
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,839
当然有钱 我把钱给了昆西
'Course there is. I gave Quince the money.

1434
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,525
是的 然后昆西给了黛比 现在黛比死了
Right, and Quince gave it to Deb, and Deb is dead.

1435
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,206
帕皮杀了他
Papi killed her.

1436
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,839
狗日的
Fuck him.

1437
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,479
那我们一起去墨西哥
Let's go down to Mexico.

1438
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,241
我们要把他们一个个揪出来 然后把他们全干掉
We'll lure 'em all down, then take every one of 'em out. Kill 'em all.

1439
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,801
然后呢?
And then what?

1440
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,359
至少要干掉昆西和帕皮
Well, at least Quince and Papi'd be dead.

1441
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,679
再然后呢?
And then what?

1442
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,999
你想让他们逍遥法外吗?
Oh, you just wanna let 'em skate?

1443
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,039
是你不明白吧 斯蒂格?
You don't get it, do ya, Stig?

1444
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,599
上帝啊 你还按自己直觉行事吗?
I mean, God bless you, you still think there's some kinda code.

1445
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,199
根本就没有直觉
There is no code.

1446
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,239
你只是遵循着海军给你的每个命令 他们耍得你团团转
You followed every order the Navy gave you, they kicked you in the teeth.

1447
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,559
根本就没有什么直觉 斯蒂格
There is no code, Stig.

1448
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,399
没人为了海军拼命 懂吗? 根本就不关海军的事
No one fights for the Navy, okay? It's not about the Navy.

1449
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,448
你是为了身边的伙伴而拼命
You fight for the guy that's fighting next to you.

1450
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,559
这对你来说没有意义吗?
That doesn't mean anything to you?

1451
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,324
我要去墨西哥了
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1452
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,999
还有你知道吗 我的直觉救了你的命
And just so you know, my code saved your life.

1453
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,719
在你心脏和肩膀之间三英尺的地方
There's three inches between your heart and your shoulder.

1454
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,722
我的子弹如果再左偏三英尺 你早死了
My bullet goes three inches left, you'd be dead.

1455
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,919
我也不会在这里
And I wouldn't be here.

1456
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,400
昆西要杀了我 因为我让你活了下来
'Cause Quince only decided to kill me because I let you live.

1457
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,279
你以为我当时是失手吗?
What, you think I missed, huh?

1458
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,487
你是这样想的吗? 你以为是我失手了?
Is that what you think? You think I missed?

1459
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,009
你什么时候见我失手过?
When have you ever seen me miss?

1460
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,841
你就呆在这儿吧 我要去墨西哥了
You stay here. I'm goin' to Mexico.

1461
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,164
我们的约定还有效吗?
Our deal still stand?

1462
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,121
我给你钱 你帮我跑路?
I give you the money, I walk away clean?

1463
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,079
好热闹 看起来你早上起的很早啊
Hola. Looks like you had a banner morning.

1464
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,684
你最好弄到钱了
You better have my money.

1465
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,365
就在这里 一个子不差
Right here. Every penny.

1466
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,239
鲍比在哪里?
Where's Bobby?

1467
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,399
我们两分道扬镳了
We had a philosophical fallin' out.

1468
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,970
把你的后箱打开
Open your trunk.

1469
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:38,039
我只是想要你一句话还有你的兄弟们 费雷・诺斯・胡里奥 他们所有人
I just want your word that you and your boys, Ferret Nose Julio, all of 'em,

1470
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,480
你们都要帮我干掉昆西司令
you'll help me kill Commander Quince.

1471
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,165
谁是昆西司令?
Who's Commander Quince?

1472
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,161
那就是他
That's him.

1473
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,439
斯蒂格曼先生 你承诺给我四千三百万
Mr. Stigman, you promised me $43 million

1474
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,119
如果我杀了这里的所有人
for killin' everyone on this ranch.

1475
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,121
你的钱就在这里 先生
Got the money right here, sir.

1476
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,319
问题是 我也承诺了给帕皮四千三百万
Thing is, I promised Papi the $43 million, too,

1477
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,079
所以恐怕你们二位要自己解决问题了
so I'm afraid you two are gonna have to duke it out.

1478
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,679
也许我们会先杀了你然后把这笔钱分了
Maybe he and I'll just kill you instead and split the money.

1479
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,727
你觉得怎么样 帕皮?
What do you say, Papi?

1480
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,719
一个人两百万?
50% of 40 million?

1481
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,484
总比死了好 不是吗?
Better than 100% dead, right?

1482
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,410
他肯定是在唬你 等你一转身 马上干掉你
He'll double-cross you. Minute your back is turned, bullet in the head.

1483
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,011
五五分账
50-50.

1484
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,239
楼顶上的说要四六分
The guy up on the roof says 60-40.

1485
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,242
他的话没一句准信
He ain't got a trustworthy bone in his body.

1486
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,964
他说要干掉我 我不又回来了?
I came back, didn't I?

1487
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,364
狗日的中情局
Fuckin' CIA.

1488
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,883
好热闹 好热闹
Red rover, red rover.

1489
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:02,999
哪位仁兄拿了我的4312.5万块 快给我交回来
Whoever's got my 43.125 million better come the fuck on out.

1490
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,570
你也叫他来收钱了?
You offer him the money, too?

1491
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,839
我可没叫上他
I didn't call him.

1492
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,251
钱在后车厢里!
It's in the trunk!

1493
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,885
你干嘛把钱在哪儿告诉他?
Why the fuck did you tell him that?

1494
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,640
多谢你 指挥官
Thank you, Commander.

1495
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,879
斯蒂格曼先生 快给我把后车厢打开
Mr. Stigman, come on out and open the trunk.

1496
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,450
慢慢的来哦
Nice and slow, now.

1497
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,881
看来我们又有新客人了?
Well, what do we got here?

1498
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,729
听起来好像一个墨西哥婚礼哦
Sounds like a Mexican wedding.

1499
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,922
这不是我的64年雪佛兰?
Is that my '64 Impala?

1500
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,846
正是
That's correct.

1501
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,126
我告诉过你
I told you.

1502
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,719
我门路广着呢
I know a guy.

1503
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,767
现在
Now,

1504
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,287
谁想看看四千三百万现金?
who wants to see $43 million?

1505
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,286
终于出现了 你可是让我找得好苦啊
For a minute there, I thought you had me chasing my tail.

1506
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,521
你想数数吗?
You want to count it?

1507
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,119
你如果想耍花招 我绝对能找到你
If you're shortin' me, I know where to find you.

1508
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,399
所以我们没事了咯?
So we're good?

1509
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,639
我不是跟你说过了吗?
Did I not give you my word?

1510
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,641
是的没错
That's right.

1511
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,649
那就别像个傻子一样对我
Then don't treat me like an asshole.

1512
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,006
我尽力
I'll try my best.

1513
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,279
你和斯蒂格曼先生可以走了
You and Mr. Stigman are free to go.

1514
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,399
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

1515
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,079
我相信你们能找到回家的路吧
I trust you can find your own way home?

1516
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,119
肯定的
That's right.

1517
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,559
- 你在干什么 鲍比?  - 我们走
- What're you doing, Bobby?  - Let's go.

1518
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,199
我不能让他们拿走那笔钱
I'm not gonna let him get away with the money.

1519
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,599
我们走 我恨那些走狗
Let's go. I hate these daggone teeth.

1520
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,759
他们不会这样放我们走的
They're not just gonna let us go.

1521
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,559
- 我心里有数  - 嘿 我都带了我的M-16
- I got a plan.  - Hey, I got my M-16.

1522
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,999
我还带了榴弹发射器和我的M-4 我们为什么不和他们干
I got my grenade launcher, I got my M-4. Let's do this shit.

1523
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,319
我自有安排 我来这里怎么会没有准备
I got a plan. I'm capable of coming up with a plan.

1524
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,599
好吧 最好别让我失望
Well, it better be a goddamn good one.

1525
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,759
你肯定会喜欢的
It's a good plan.

1526
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,966
要下雨咯
Make it rain.

1527
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,359
这就是你的计划? 炸飞四千三百万前进?
That was your plan? To blow up $43 million?

1528
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,839
是的 这就是我计划的高明之处 没人料得到
Yeah, that's why it's a brilliant plan. Nobody expected it.

1529
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,401
快走
Go.

1530
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,365
快点 跟上!
Come on, move it!

1531
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,166
该死! 快走
Dumb assholes! Move it!

1532
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,921
你不来?
You comin'?

1533
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,245
当然来 我就在后面跟着你
Go ahead, I'll be right behind you.

1534
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,399
别打飞了
Don't miss.

1535
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,731
我从来不会失手!
I never miss!

1536
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,407
我就说吧
Told ya.

1537
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,241
斯蒂格! 斯蒂格!
Stig! Stig!

1538
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,919
别动手 别动手
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1539
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,921
游戏时间结束了
Playtime's over.

1540
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,244
别再跟我兜圈子了
No more fucking around.

1541
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,486
现在
Now,

1542
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,329
丢掉你的武器
drop your weapon.

1543
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,799
让斯蒂格曼也照做
Tell Mr. Stigman to do the same.

1544
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,961
你跟他说吧
You tell him.

1545
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,319
现在很清楚
It's real simple.

1546
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,846
要么我们都放下枪要么我们都去死
We can all make a deal or we can all die.

1547
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,519
我可不想这样
I'm not making any deals.

1548
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,319
和你的人好好说说 鲍比
Talk to your man, Bobby.

1549
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,759
别犯傻
Be the smart one.

1550
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,639
你觉得特雷司・克鲁塞斯是我们唯一存钱的地方吗?
You think Tres Cruces is the only stash we got?

1551
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,239
我们有20多处金库 倒处都是钱
We got 20 more. We got money everywhere.

1552
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,919
你什么都改变不了
You're not gonna change a damn thing.

1553
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,921
斯蒂格?
Stig?

1554
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,401
怎么说?
Yeah?

1555
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,161
你是我的人 对吗?
You're my people, right?

1556
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,961
那是当然
That's correct.

1557
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,881
你还好吗?
You good?

1558
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,131
没法更好了
Never better.

1559
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,359
我们不是一般人 所以
We're not people, though.

1560
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,646
所以我们是一家人
This makes us family.

1561
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,851
好的 兄弟
All right, brother.

1562
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,799
嘿 墨西哥爱因斯坦
Hey, se?or Einstein,

1563
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,239
你看起来状况很糟糕哦 老兄
you're looking kind of fucked up sittin' there, man.

1564
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,241
你们还好吗?
You all right?

1565
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,282
帮我好好割草
Mow my lawn.

1566
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,959
你知道什么事情超酷吗?
Well, you know what was so cool?

1567
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,919
你开着64年的雪佛兰进来真是太棒了
You rolling in on that '64 Impala.

1568
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,519
你看起来就是坏小子一个哦
I mean, you looked badass, man.

1569
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,759
那是肯定的
Yeah, that's right.

1570
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,999
听着 还有一件事 还有一件事
Listen, one more thing, one more thing.

1571
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,081
啥事?
What?

1572
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,440
把你的枪给我
Give me your gun.

1573
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,479
把你的枪给我
Give me your gun.

1574
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,559
你不是认真的吧
You're not serious.

1575
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,561
我是认真的
Yes, I am.

1576
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,921
谢谢
Thank you.

1577
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,119
我们经历了那么多事 你真的要这样做吗?
You're really gonna do this after everything we've been through?

1578
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,079
手臂还是大腿?
Arm or leg?

1579
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,679
这不会让你好受些的
This is not gonna make you feel better.

1580
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,719
我想还是腿好 因为腿上肉更多 这样不会伤到骨头
I'm thinking leg. Because leg, there's more flesh, there's not as much bone.

1581
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,999
手臂就可能...
The arm will...

1582
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,559
你知道吗? 你简直就是个...
You know what you are? You are a petty...

1583
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,086
狗娘养的!
Fucking son of a bitch!

1584
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,119
很痛啊 你知道吗? 要是搞不好你可能害死我啊?
Hurts, doesn't it? You know you coulda killed me?

1585
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,119
不会吧? 再向左三英尺你才会死呢
Is that right? Three more inches to the left.

1586
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,199
这完全是两码事好吗
Don't even say it, man.

1587
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,679
你不会再对服务生抛媚眼了吧
You wouldn't be winking at waitresses anymore.

1588
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,719
我还是会的 我总是不能自已
I'd still wink, I just wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

1589
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,919
你知道我的 我从不失手
You know me, I don't miss.

1590
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,599
- 我从来不会失手  - 你上次看到我失手是什么时候?
- I never miss.  - When's the last time you saw me miss?

1591
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,251
你这下一路都得背着我了
You gonna carry my ass all the way the fuck home.

1592
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,283
嘿 慢点 很疼哎
Oh, shit, man. This burns.

1593
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,771
那就对了
That's correct.

1594
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,839
你知道 我向你开枪的时候我还不知道你是谁呢
You know, I shot you when I didn't know who you were.

1595
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,319
我们是一家人之前
Before we were family.

1596
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,399
但是现在不一样了
There's a difference.

1597
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,767
但是我们现在是一家人 我向你开枪因为我知道你是谁了
But we're family now. I shot you because I know who you are.

1598
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,086
这就不对了
That ain't right.

1599
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,804
他们肯定看到了
They definitely got the look.

1600
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,760
防风墨镜加上那副臭脸 绝对是中情局的人
Assholes and windshield sunglasses, practically CIA uniform.

1601
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,765
你们还要吃点什么吗?
Can I get you boys anything else?

1602
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,086
我想试试你们的甜甜圈?
Are your doughnuts any good?

1603
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,566
跟你说实话吧 甜甜圈味道真的一般
Tell you the truth, they're pretty lousy.

1604

1609
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,599
你知道的 对于一个刚刚炸飞四千三百万的人来说
You know, for a guy who just blew up $43 million,

1610
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,719
你给的小费倒是不少啊
all of a sudden, you are a very generous tipper.

1611
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,007
谁说我炸飞了四千三百万?
Who said I blew up $43 million?

1612

你在说什么呢?
What are you sayin'?

1613
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,239

Well, if you're hearin' it, it's only because you're hearin' it,

1616
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,799
我可啥都没说
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

1617
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,290
你留了多少?
How much did you keep?

1618
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,486
两百万?
Two million?

1619
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,159
我们一人能有一百万哦
That's like one each.

1620
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,479
所以你拿一半?
So now you get half?

1621
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,608
- 你看 我打死了一半的人  - 那又怎样?
- Well, I shot half the guys.  - So?

1622
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,211
