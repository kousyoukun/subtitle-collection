00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,564
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,766
How many?

7
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,927
Two.

8
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:07,123
Listen, I wanted to get a safe deposit box.
Can you do that for me?

9
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,321
Okay. Your box
will be available

10
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,812
any time from
an hour after opening

11
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:21,449
to 30 minutes before close.
This is your key.

12
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:22,769
Thank you.

13
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:24,766
Oh, um, also, if you open
a checking account,

14
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:27,766
we'll give you 5% off the box along
with free overdraft protection.

15
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:30,442
Oh, here I was hopin'
for a free toaster.

16
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,763
Why would a bank give out free toasters?

17
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:37,604
Hello, Ma.

18
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:39,606
I'm ordering you
the French toast.

19
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:40,803
No, thank you.

20
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:42,762
<i>Our very patient waitress,
Maggie,</i>

21
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:43,844
<i>well, at least it says
Maggie on her name tag,</i>

22
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,282
has asked me
to order four times.

23
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:46,962
If I don't order at this
point, it's just rude.

24
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:48,602
I can come back.
No, it's okay.

25
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,243
You know what? I'm making
an executive decision.

26
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:51,443
Pancakes.
Okay.

27
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:53,643
<i>No pancakes. I don't like pancakes.
No pancakes.</i>

28
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:54,803
What are you, a communist?

29
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:56,443
My friend'll have the
pancakes and a fried egg.

30
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,763
I'm thinkin' hash, but only if
it's like chunky style, okay?

31
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:02,043
<i>Listen, if you order me eggs and
pancakes, I'm gonna kick your behind.</i>

32
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:05,004
But you gotta eat breakfast. It's
the most important meal of the day.

33
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:07,963
Uh, ma'am, ignore
everything he said, okay?

34
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:10,644
Don't bring me any
eggs and pancakes.

35
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:13,808
Just bring me some coffee and
bring him a couple eggs.

36
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,963
I don't want eggs.
I want hash.

37
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:17,045
You know what,
put a couple eggs on it.

38
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,363
Give him some rye toast, too.

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,964
No rye toast for me.
I don't like rye toast.

40
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,324
And a pancake.
No pancakes.

41
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,084
Maybe a little silver-dollar one.
You got the little baby ones?

42
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:27,089
No pancakes, no silver dollars, no rye toast.
I like pumpernickel.

43
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,205
I do have pumpernickel.
Pumpernickel toast.

44
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,285
- Hey, Maggie, wait. One more thing.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:33,604
That's for you. You take that with
you till we see each other again

46
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,494
in case you miss me
too much, okay?

47
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:39,175
Why you gotta do that? What?

48
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,125
Wink at the waitresses
like that?

49
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,855
Waitresses like me.
Nobody likes you.

50
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:44,685
So?
So.

51
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:45,765
What do ya got?

52
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:48,168
So, it is a sleepy bank.

53
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,005
Doable?
That's correct.

54
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,246
I told you.

55
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:57,417
That is a lot of doughnuts.

56
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,768
I'll be right back
with your hash.

57
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:04,935
Maggie, your hot homemade
doughnuts, they any good?

58
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:07,055
- Best in three counties.
- I'll tell you what you do.

59
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,246
You bring us three
of those bad boys.

60
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:10,726
Put 'em in a to-go box
for us, all right?

61
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,058
All right.
Thank you.

62
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:15,407
All right,
time to make the move.

63
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:18,255
All right, there's gonna be
some sirens in this bitch.

64
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:19,608
I'm gonna go shake the weasel.

65
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:22,088
Shake the weasel.
Gonna go shake the weasel.

66
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,886
Hey. Good morning, sir.
How are you? Morning.

67
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:26,049
Hey, Maggie.

68
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,527
I'm very sorry about my friend.

69
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:30,527
He was kicked in the
head as a child.

70
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,496
He's really not that bad.
No, he is.

71
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,614
What's goin' on?

72
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:43,527
Okay, I'm just gonna have
you all exit the building.

73
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:46,568
It might be a false alarm,
but just do it safely.

74
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,571
Thank you.
Thank you.

75
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,448
Is everybody out? I'm gonna
need you to step outside.

76
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:52,728
All right, Maggie, I'm
just gonna grab my friend.

77
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,015
Okay. We gotta pay our bill.

78
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:58,770
We should go.

79
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,408
Is that all you're
gonna leave for a tip?

80
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:02,928
It's 15%.
You leave 15%.

81
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,128
No, you gotta
leave at least 30.

82
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,329
No, you don't.
15% is standard.

83
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,649
My Maggie's about to be out of a job, man.
Don't be cheap.

84
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,254
Okay, there's five.
That's seven.

85
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,690
There you go.
Come on.

86
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:12,930
All right.

87
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,689
What?
No, you didn't.

88
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,180
Yes, I did.
Oh, my God.

89
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,177
How'd you say it?

90
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,929
Never rob a bank
across from the diner

91
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,289
with the best doughnuts
in three counties?

92
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,337
That's correct.

93
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:57,058
Bobby. Papi's down
in the stables.

94
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,216
Why don't
you get somethin' to eat?

95
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:00,411
I'm not hungry.

96
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:01,981
Sure you are.
I wanna come with you.

97
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,491
Hey, listen. We're here to do business.
Diplomatically.

98
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:06,531
Well, I can be diplomatic.

99
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,331
You can be hungry, too, right?

100
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:09,538
Bobby.

101
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,224
Wait here.
Okay.

102
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,452
Somebody sittin' here?

103
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:15,532
Little Toro.

104
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:18,012
Oh, well, you move your feet,
you lose your seat, right?

105
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,131
Lose your head, too.
That's correct.

106
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:21,817
So, where is Little Toro?

107
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,141
<i>AlllÃ­, where you put him.</i>

108
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,096
<i>- Aqui?
- AllÃ­.</i>

109
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:40,184
Let's play some dominoes.

110
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,823
Papi's ready.
Yeah.

111
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,705
Papi Greco!

112
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,099
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

113
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,261
That's correct.

114
00:06:56,694 --> 00:07:01,383
Quick, an ostrich, a tank of
ether, a '63 Impala convertible.

115
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:03,214
Make it a '64.

116
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,054
My side of the border.

117
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,334
I know a guy.

118
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:10,905
What did I tell you? He never
says no, never says maybe,

119
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:14,098
never says, "I'll
see what I can do."

120
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:18,176
Nice bull.

121
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:20,783
I hope he's a good breeder.

122
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,581
That's a shame
about Little Toro.

123
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,734
Julio caught him skimming.

124
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,896
Oh.

125
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:27,699
That don't sound
like Little Toro.

126
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,899
Is that for me?
That's correct.

127
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:34,935
Everybody skims a little cream.
It's human nature.

128
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:38,258
Just 'cause it's human
don't mean you let it go.

129
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:39,424
Hmm.

130
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,375
Nice lines. Good color.

131
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:47,415
That's right.

132
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,067
He knows a guy.

133
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:54,098
What you got for me?

134
00:07:58,257 --> 00:07:59,497
Cash.

135
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:01,583
Cash?

136
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:06,306
Supposed to be givin'
me 100,000 to deal.

137
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:08,378
Why didn't you give me
$100,000 worth of cocaine?

138
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:11,497
Where's the cocaine?

139
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,943
My buyer wants cocaine.

140
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:14,656
So let him buy cocaine.

141
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:17,457
That's what he's tryin' to do.
He's trying to buy cocaine.

142
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,017
I told him I knew a guy,
therefore I come to you.

143
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:21,941
You the guy I know.
That's why I told him.

144
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:26,497
So take back the passports.

145
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:29,582
After Little Toro, we're not
takin' on any new customers.

146
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,057
Well, no disrespect,
but I ain't no new customer.

147
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,504
You been dealin' with me
for a long time.

148
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:35,983
You keep the passports.

149
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,098
Keep the money, too.

150
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,138
When you're ready to give me the
product, give me the product.

151
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,265
Till then...

152
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,779
You owe me.

153
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,499
It's not very sporting, man.

154
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,945
At least give the chickens
a chance to shoot back.

155
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,625
Hey, man, I'm just sayin'. If I'm
gonna kill a defenseless animal,

156
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,339
I'm gonna honor its sacrifice by
grilling it into some tasty barbecue.

157
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,139
What I'm not gonna do
is torture it

158
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,872
just to prove I can't hit anything
further away than my own pecker.

159
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,552
<i>Your cuate's a real junkyard dog.
Mmm.</i>

160
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,020
Hey, cowboy.
You, the pretty one.

161
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:33,230
You ever hear the expression, "You
got a face only a mother can love"?

162
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,546
That don't apply to you. You are uglier
than the devil's asshole itself.

163
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:37,708
Stig!

164
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,182
What are you doin'?

165
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:42,380
They're torturing
chickens, man.

166
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,712
What are you eatin'?

167
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:45,221
A chicken.

168
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:46,621
Come here. It's not
the same thing, okay?

169
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:49,181
See that bag over
there by the table?

170
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:50,662
Buffet table next
to the potato salad.

171
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,421
Yeah, the bowling bag.
What about it?

172
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:54,550
Little Tom's head
is in that bag.

173
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,912
Bullshit.
Yeah.

174
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,945
You know what?
That's fucked up, man.

175
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,701
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go.
Okay? Come on, let's go.

176
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:08,023
Say it in English, you goat fuck.

177
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:09,982
Suck my chicken.

178
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,381
That's funny
comin' from you, fat boy.

179
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:14,303
You ain't seen your pecker
since you were a baby.

180
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:16,582
Just 'cause you put your
finger in your belly button

181
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,189
and brown shit comes out don't
mean it's your asshole.

182
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,192
What did you say? Don't
worry about it, man.

183
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:28,711
Now dig 'em up and make
some damn barbecue.

184
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,430
<i>Bye, chica.</i>

185
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:37,515
Did you just wink at him?

186
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:39,223
I did wink at him,
'cause he's my bitch now.

187
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,225
Uh-Oh!

188
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:43,832
<i>That's good shootin'.
Gracias.</i>

189
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:51,666
You know, Little Toro never
did nothin' to nobody, man.

190
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,470
We should rip off Papi's stash at
the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

191
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,464
You know, Papi's guy
delivers a briefcase

192
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:59,304
full of money to Tres
Cruces every two weeks.

193
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,114
That's gotta add up to, what,
like three million at least.

194
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:04,588
If Papi knew we were even talkin'
about rippin' off Tres Cruces,

195
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:07,589
it would be our heads in that
bag next to the potato salad.

196
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:10,715
No way. Our two heads would
never fit in a bag that small.

197
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:16,345
Come on, man,
let's hit the bank.

198
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,313
Little Toro was your friend.
He was my friend.

199
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,194
So? What
do you mean "so"?

200
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,429
What if it was me? What if it was my
head Papi ran through the saw mill?

201
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:25,116
You wouldn't come after him?
Nope.

202
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:26,985
You wouldn't kill him?
Nope.

203
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,307
Shit, man, he did that to you, I'd kill him.
You know why I'd kill him?

204
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:30,946
Because you're my people
and there's a code.

205
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,546
There is no code, first of all.

206
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:34,865
You do whatever you gotta
do, whatever it takes.

207
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,106
And second?

208
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:40,226
Right, we're not people
'cause you don't have people.

209
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:41,433
That's correct.

210
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,151
Purpose for your
visit to Mexico?

211
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,354
Quail hunting.

212
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:50,198
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart
attack so we cut our trip short.

213
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,506
Tuba City?

214
00:11:53,507 --> 00:11:54,713
It's near Odessa.

215
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:56,106
Nice place?

216
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:58,109
Hellhole,
but she's my favorite aunt.

217
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:00,949
- Don't move. Let me see your hands.
- Oh, shit.

218
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:05,798
Tell us about your trip.
Lawyer.

219
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,066
What's the big deal?
Lawyer.

220
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,036
You were down in Sonora,
weren't you?

221
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:16,152
You don't think Agent Jessup and the
DEA know about you and Papi Greco?

222
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,507
Lawyer. Lawyer.

223
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:18,548
They know you were
at his ranch.

224
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:19,710
I know I need a lawyer.

225
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,039
Tell Agent Rees
about Papi Greco.

226
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:24,231
Who?
Papi Greco.

227
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:28,234
Well, who's that? Some Mexican
Santa Claus or something?

228
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,678
Come on, Mr. Stigman.

229
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:33,709
I think it's in your best
interest to cooperate.

230
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,869
You need to stop playin'
the stupid card, all right?

231
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,189
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to
cooperate with whatever you need.

232
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,268
I mean, as an American, I know
you're just doin' your job,

233
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,388
and sometimes innocent folks like
me get caught up in the system.

234
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,908
It's like the airlines. They don't
lose your luggage on purpose, right?

235
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,789
But everybody takes it
so damn personal.

236
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,549
Come on, Mr. Stigman.
So you wanna play games?

237
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,351
Well, what'd you have in mind?

238
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,759
Do you wanna help yourself? Yes.

239
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,551
Do I have to do it
in front of him?

240
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,277
All right, we're done here.
Thank you, Mr. Stigman.

241
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,875
You gonna leave?
Oh, yes.

242
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,957
Wow.

243
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,596
Oh, my God.

244
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:10,038
How do you concentrate
workin' with her, man?

245
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:24,112
Five border agents are rippin'
apart your car as we speak.

246
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,511
They ain't gonna find anything.

247
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:32,881
Where'd you hide the cocaine?

248
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,040
Can they hear us?
No.

249
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,643
Can they see us?
No.

250
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,118
Okay.

251
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,637
There was no cocaine.

252
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:46,032
You had a deal in place.
Right.

253
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,591
Five hundred passports
in return for cocaine.

254
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:49,798
Right.

255
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,271
Hey, Bobby.

256
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:52,312
How you doin', Deb?

257
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,642
Good. Man, your boy
Stig's a piece of work.

258
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:58,318
He winked at you, didn't he?

259
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:00,634
How'd you know?

260
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,882
Bobby didn't get the cocaine.

261
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:04,444
What?
What happened?

262
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,792
Papi offered me cash.
I told him no.

263
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,397
I told him
to keep the passports,

264
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,552
so, eventually, he's gotta
come up with the cocaine.

265
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:15,319
What about this guy you said
you could flip? Little Toro?

266
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,682
I got him.
It's real close.

267
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,116
I don't know
who you are anymore.

268
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:24,040
It's like...

269
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:26,278
It's like you're
out on this limb.

270
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:28,556
And you've been out
there way too long.

271
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:30,318
And you're sayin'
that to say what?

272
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:32,078
I don't like goin' to the
funerals of my own men.

273
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,602
Well, then don't come, boss.
Don't come.

274
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:35,802
Okay?

275
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:37,758
I spent the last
three years of my life

276
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:39,160
crawlin' through
a Mexican sewer

277
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:41,674
tryin' to work my way up the
line to get next to Papi Greco.

278
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,439
You can't take me off this now.

279
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:44,642
Jessup, he's close.

280
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,837
You can't take me off this now.
I know.

281
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:48,646
Not now.

282
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:53,645
Two weeks.

283
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:57,005
You don't flip Little Toro
by then, I'm pullin' ya out.

284
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:01,561
We're done.

285
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,400
Think Jessup knows about us?

286
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:24,564
What "us"? You don't
do "us," remember?

287
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:26,761
Oh, I remember.

288
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,799
Besides, I'm dating.

289
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:31,916
Oh, right, right.
You're dating...

290
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,076
Mmm-hmm.

291
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:36,240
...your imaginary
boyfriend, Harvey.

292
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:39,441
Uh, he's not my boyfriend,
and his name's not Harvey.

293
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:42,726
I like Harvey. It has a
nice ring to it. Harvey.

294
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,916
You don't get to be
jealous anymore, Bobby.

295
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:46,123
Harvey.

296
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:48,436
You pushed me away.

297
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:49,962
So you could be with Harvey.

298
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,648
Fuck you.

299
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:55,569
Little Tom's dead.

300
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:58,519
You told Jessup you were
close to flipping him.

301
00:15:58,718 --> 00:15:59,958
I was.

302
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:01,997
But when I got
down to the ranch,

303
00:16:01,998 --> 00:16:04,160
Papi's boys was throwin'
his head around in a bag.

304
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,002
Well, that's game, then.

305
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:10,080
With Little Toro off the board,
Jessup's pulling you out.

306
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,320
Not if you don't tell him.

307
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:13,158
I'm your control, Bobby.
That's correct.

308
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,160
I have to tell him.

309
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,566
That's why I need you

310
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:21,082
to let me rob
Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

311
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,326
You want to rob a bank?

312
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,680
No, Stig wants to rob
the bank. It's his idea.

313
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,125
So there's no entrapment.

314
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,799
What I want
is access to that money

315
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,848
that Papi's got
in the safe deposit box.

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,558
You know no judge
is gonna give you

317
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,129
a blanket warrant
for the boxes.

318
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,163
We don't need a warrant. Not if
the money's evidence in a crime.

319
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:38,719
We just trace it
back to ownership,

320
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,564
we got Papi on tax evasion,
possible RICO.

321
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,451
Yeah?
Yeah.

322
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,759
And what about Stig?

323
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,841
What about him?

324
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,241
He's a side dish.

325
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,680
You bust him
in front of the bank,

326
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,365
he does a smooth 20 years in the
penitentiary, you get a medal.

327
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,530
The bank gets us Papi.

328
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,006
And that's all
that matters, right?

329
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,929
It takes whatever
it takes, baby.

330
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:03,203
Did you ever really love me?

331
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:04,842
Hmm?

332
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,406
I really meant to love you.

333
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:34,722
Shit.

334
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,607
You don't have to knock.
It's always open.

335
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,884
Yeah, good.
Let's hit the bank.

336
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:41,083
Let's hit the bank.

337
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:42,886
The Tres Cruces?
That's correct.

338
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,089
Oh, shit.

339
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:47,202
Here I am still spinnin' about how we
got yanked outta line at the border.

340
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:49,046
So you in or you out?

341
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,332
I'm in, yeah.
It's just...

342
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:53,770
Have you ever had anything like
that happen to you before?

343
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,449
I mean, they were 100%
convinced we were holding.

344
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:59,004
And we would've if Papi
hadn't welched on that coke.

345
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,402
So you're sayin'
that to say what?

346
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:04,053
I'm sayin' it's only
'cause you're hearin' it.

347
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:05,363
No, you sayin' somethin'.

348
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,603
And if you sayin' it, I'm hearin'
it 'cause you're sayin' it.

349
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:08,723
What are you sayin'?
Let it be said.

350
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:10,203
I think you're
fuckin' playin' me.

351
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:11,251
You wanna be played?

352
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:12,402
I've been at your
hip for 10 months,

353
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:14,283
but after this, I think
maybe you're playin' me.

354
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,323
I got you.
No, you didn't.

355
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:23,803
Oh, I did. The corner
of your eye was twitchin'.

356
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:25,375
The corner?
That wasn't a twitch.

357
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:27,294
That was a wink.
That's my move.

358
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:45,012
Yup, that's Papi's
chubby little kid right there.

359
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,295
Feed that motherfucker
quesadillas...

360
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:48,564
Oh, my God.

361
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:49,604
She's chubby, too.

362
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:50,884
In all the right places.

363
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:53,287
How does an old, fat, ugly
fuck get a girl like that?

364
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:54,732
Money.

365
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:57,927
All right, here we go.

366
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,448
Same thing every two weeks.

367
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,565
Papi flies over the border
with a briefcase full of cash.

368
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:06,845
He spends a week
with the mistress.

369
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,165
Ferret Nose Julio drives it out

370
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,611
to the Tres Cruces
Savings and Loan.

371
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:11,845
Think they got three
million in the bank, huh?

372
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:12,928
Easy.

373
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:15,608
Bingo.

374
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:17,886
Money, money, money, money.

375
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,172
Oh, yeah.

376
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,768
Why don't you hit the diner
and check out the doughnuts?

377
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:07,818
I'm kinda more in a corned beef
hash mood, to tell you the truth.

378
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,414
You never heard the saying,

379
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:11,088
"Never rob a bank
across from a diner

380
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,978
that has the best doughnuts
in three counties"?

381
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,769
That's not a saying.
Yes, it is.

382
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:17,248
I get what you're sayin', but it's not a saying.
You never heard it?

383
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,368
It is a saying.
It's a saying now.

384
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,416
Okay. Let you tell it.

385
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,891
Make the move.

386
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,900
Bad DEA agent.

387
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:50,656
Am I bad?
Yes, you are.

388
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:51,812
I'm a bad girl?

389
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:53,137
Yes, you are.

390
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:59,653
Stig decided to hit
the bank tomorrow, 3:00.

391
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:02,216
Stig decided?

392
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:04,977
Well, with or without
me, he's goin' in.

393
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,860
Well, I still haven't
talked to Jessup.

394
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:09,538
Stig doesn't know that.
3:00 tomorrow he's goin' in.

395
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,979
If we want Papi,
I gotta go in with him.

396
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:16,893
You're not even gonna give
me a choice, are you?

397
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:21,501
I'm givin' you no other options
as a way to protect you.

398
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:26,620
Just have the troops meet me outside
the bank, 3:05 when we come out.

399
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:28,772
3:05.

400
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:30,104
Okay. And don't shoot me.

401
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:32,340
Even if you want to.
We'll see.

402
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:15,660
License and
registration, cowboy.

403
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:18,696
Cute.

404
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:22,693
- What's up, Teemo?
- What's up, brother?

405
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:24,344
How are you, brother? I miss you, man.
I miss you, man.

406
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:26,497
Got you a turkey burger.
Special sauce.

407
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:27,974
Commander wants to see you.

408
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,101
Yes, sir.

409
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,063
So, half a mile from home.

410
00:22:32,815 --> 00:22:35,183
I got Bobby all wound
up and ready to go, sir.

411
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:37,061
Ordnance you requested.

412
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,934
Do you know, the Admiral's
proud of what you've done.

413
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:42,174
You've gone way out on a limb.

414
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:44,174
If the bank falls
right tomorrow,

415
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,015
he says you can come in from the
cold, rejoin your brothers.

416
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,655
Great. Be good just to put
the uniform back on, sir.

417
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:51,255
I didn't join the Navy to commit
felonies and hang with drug dealers.

418
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:53,224
Even if you're damn good at it?

419
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:55,105
I do what I do
for the Navy, sir.

420
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:56,615
It's all part of
the Admiral's plan.

421
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:57,975
We get this three million
from the bank,

422
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,335
we run cross-border ops on Papi
and all the other cartels.

423
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:02,464
So tomorrow, clean and precise.

424
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:05,656
Tick all the boxes, nothing left undone.
You got it?

425
00:23:05,657 --> 00:23:07,102
Yes, sir.

426
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:09,864
Let's go.

427
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:15,778
Hey, nice jacket.

428
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:17,856
Hey, tell your mother
she's gotta move out

429
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:19,427
of my house at some point, man.

430
00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:02,506
All right, what do you
want, clown or Frankie?

431
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:04,470
Frankie.

432
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:21,188
So, what'd you do
with the .22?

433
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,661
Traded to my cousin
for an espresso machine.

434
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,067
You're gonna need
special beans for that, right?

435
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,659
Uh, uh, uh.

436
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,106
You can reach for your
firearm, but do it real slow.

437
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,822
Any other people
in the buildin'?

438
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:34,379
- What the hell is this?
- It's a bank robbery.

439
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,699
Only instead
of robbin' the bank

440
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,019
and lettin' you chase after us,

441
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,863
we decided to come
after you first.

442
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,981
Let's go.

443
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,351
All right,
give me your gun, there.

444
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:59,186
All right, everybody sit down.
Everybody sit down on the floor.

445
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:02,141
Ladies behind the counter, keep your
hands visible, not on the alarms.

446
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:03,143
Let's go, let's go!

447
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,669
It's all right, girls. Just
give 'em the drawer cash.

448
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:07,666
Did we ask for the drawer cash?

449
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:10,101
Come on, come on, come on.
Sit right here. Sit, sit.

450
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:11,621
Let's go, on the floor.

451
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:14,102
- Hey, guard!
- Hey! Hey.

452
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:18,109
Look, I'm tryin' to
be polite, all right?

453
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:20,192
Just sit tight and
this'll be over soon.

454
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:21,744
Open the gate.

455
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:23,861
I don't have a key.

456
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:24,863
What'd you say?

457
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:29,144
Easy.

458
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:31,862
You lie to me again, it's gonna
be more than a fuckin' problem.

459
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,864
Get out there, now.

460
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,342
Get on the floor.

461
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:36,993
You good? I'm goin' in.

462
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:51,184
Shh.
It's all right.

463
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:52,994
Oh, Timothy.

464
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:55,913
Hey, it's okay.

465
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:58,755
It's okay. Yeah?

466
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:01,392
Okay. Here you go.

467
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,548
Showtime!
Fire in the hole!

468
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,956
Holy shit!

469
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,425
Hey, Frankie,
somethin's not right.

470
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:31,314
They're all stuffed with money.

471
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:33,269
I thought you said there
would only be one or two.

472
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,194
Every single one of them.

473
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,508
I'm at 32 boxes and counting.

474
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:39,549
Look, there's way
more than 3 million.

475
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,589
And there's still
a lot more here.

476
00:26:42,706 --> 00:26:45,226
All right, well, take 'em all.
We'll figure it out later.

477
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:54,505
You go ahead,
I'll get the rest.

478
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:55,588
All right.

479
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,067
Listen.

480
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:01,226
May be gunfire outside, okay?
So if it hits,

481
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:02,707
you get everybody
behind the counters.

482
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:04,545
This is for the jail
across the street.

483
00:27:04,546 --> 00:27:06,709
You let the cops out.
Let 'em out.

484
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:11,468
Come on.

485
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:46,318
That is a hell of a lot
more than $3 million.

486
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:49,595
How much, you figure?

487
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:52,229
We couldn't be the luckiest chumps
on the face of the earth, could we?

488
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:54,073
You feel lucky?
No, I don't.

489
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:55,799
I mean, this can't
be Papi's money.

490
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:58,868
People are gonna chase us off the end
of the earth for money like this.

491
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:01,349
Well, I hate to tell you this,
Stig, but I got more bad news...

492
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,273
You take that hand away
nice and slow, Bobby.

493
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,431
Okay.

494
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,961
Put the gun down, Stig.

495
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,029
You know I really
like you, right?

496
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,236
I like you, too.

497
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,716
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

498
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,669
Nobody likes me, okay?
And I'm okay with it.

499
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,115
I do. I like you
more than most.

500
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,030
You're not just sayin' it 'cause
I got a gun pointed to you?

501
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:23,635
Why don't you just
put the gun down?

502
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:26,269
Shit.

503
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,389
Oh.

504
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,199
Hot-doggin'!

505
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,871
I'm sorry, man.

506
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:33,518
What'd you do that for?

507
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,321
Shit, man, I had to!
No, you didn't.

508
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,390
It's just a little flesh wound.
You'll be all right.

509
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:41,072
Drink the water,
and then you'll be able...

510
00:28:44,111 --> 00:28:45,442
What is that?

511
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:49,112
In your hand. Is that
a badge in your hand?

512
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,911
Tell me you're not a no-good,
two-timin' son of a bitch.

513
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:53,991
Two-timin'?

514
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:55,915
Tell me.
You shot me.

515
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:02,001
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, man.
Hang on.

516
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:03,717
No, you wait a minute.

517
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,198
Stig.

518
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:10,714
Hey.

519
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:26,639
The United States is the
greatest country in the world

520
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:30,799
because we accept
a man is, at his core,

521
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,679
greedy,

522
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:34,153
selfish

523
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:35,954
and covetous.

524
00:29:36,113 --> 00:29:38,639
I had no choice.
They took my key.

525
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:40,603
I would never willingly
open the vault.

526
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:42,802
Keep your hands
on the desk, please.

527
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:44,797
In America,
we line everybody up.

528
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:47,163
Say, "You're on your own."

529
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:48,959
"Grab all you can grab."

530
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:50,481
I'm innocent.

531
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,481
Nobody's innocent, friend.

532
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:56,519
There's just the guilty,

533
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:58,846
the ignorant

534
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:01,246
and the unlucky.

535
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,079
Did you take our money?

536
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:13,556
You fellas look like
you're waitin' for a bus.

537
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,674
You guys let us know
when you're done.

538
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:18,839
Oh, I'm done, and thank
you for the courtesy.

539
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:19,997
Who is that guy?

540
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:21,715
You heard of
the hidden hand of God?

541
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:23,683
Well, that's God's
son of a bitch.

542
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:28,997
Call the DDO and get a list of everyone
who knew we had money in this bank.

543
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:33,359
You two realize those sunglasses
make you look like assholes.

544
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:36,716
Excuse me,
when'd that diner burn?

545
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:37,836
Yesterday.

546
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,235
I want interviews
with the wait staff

547
00:30:39,236 --> 00:30:40,555
and every customer
in the place.

548
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:42,206
It was just a grease fire.

549
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,925
Did I ask your opinion, Gomer?

550
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:47,516
You ever hear the saying,

551
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:49,316
"Never rob a bank
across from a diner

552
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:51,445
with the best doughnuts
in three counties"?

553
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:54,564
If that diner fire's
a coincidence,

554
00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:57,038
it's only 'cause we ain't
looking hard enough.

555
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,644
That is an impressive
amount of greenbacks.

556
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:12,368
43,125,000 of 'em, sir.

557
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:13,478
Mmm.

558
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:15,797
Recount it. Pack it up.
We'll stow it back in Corpus.

559
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:17,717
It was my impression we were
supposed to come out of that bank

560
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,237
with 3 million at most, sir.

561
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:20,557
Mmm-hmm.

562
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:21,605
Whose money was it?

563
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:24,408
Bad men unworthy of it.

564
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,762
Did you know
Bobby Beans was DEA?

565
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:29,879
No, I didn't.

566
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:32,759
No offense, sir, but you really need
to work on your surprised face.

567
00:31:33,198 --> 00:31:36,009
Well, if he was DEA,
he helped you rob a bank.

568
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:39,239
Which means he's dirty, and
for that, I have no mercy.

569
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,007
Where'd you leave him?
In the desert.

570
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,207
Is he dead?
More than likely.

571
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,409
"More than likely."

572
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,204
You wanna tell me
what that means?

573
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:54,599
The whole point of you
working with Bobby Beans

574
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,959
was to kill him off
and create a cut-out

575
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,599
so the op couldn't
get traced back to us.

576
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,559
My cover's solid. There's
no way it'll trace back.

577
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,158
My cover is solid. There's no
way it'll trace back, sir.

578
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,322
That's a call made
above your pay grade.

579
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,167
Yes, sir.

580
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,685
Assign two of the boys to stow the
money back at the naval base.

581
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:17,003
The rest'll come with us to
check on the body of Mr. Beans.

582
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:18,804
Stigman, wanna come with me?

583
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:54,251
Hey there, buddy.
Hey.

584
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:55,521
<i>You habla?</i>

585
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:56,523
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,041
<i>I hablo.</i>

587
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,241
Good, that's good.

588
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:01,405
Don't trust in him
till you see his paper.

589
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:05,125
If he's got papers, I'll see his papers.
You got papers, right?

590
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,524
No. No,
I got no papers.

591
00:33:07,683 --> 00:33:09,411
Well, that's gonna
be a problem.

592
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:11,682
See, Slim Jay and me,
we done assigned ourselves

593
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:13,842
protection this here
stretch of the border.

594
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:16,164
Officially unofficially.

595
00:33:16,923 --> 00:33:19,290
So we really gonna
have to see your papers.

596
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:21,452
Make sure you ain't
no Muslim or nothin'.

597
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:26,763
Oh, yeah.
No, I do have it.

598
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:31,972
And let me have your gun.

599
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:36,684
Give it to me.

600
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:38,484
<i>Gracias.</i>

601
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:41,091
You know how to pray?

602
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,016
Teemo.
How we doin', boys?

603
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:01,208
Any sign of Bobby Beans?

604
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:03,374
Checked all the washes
to the southeast.

605
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:05,250
No sign of a body.

606
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:08,491
All right.

607
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:12,816
Well, Stig, you put
us in quite a hole.

608
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,724
I don't see it that way, sir, but
you're the man with the oak leaves.

609
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:17,568
All that pride I had in you.

610
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,491
That loyalty?

611
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:21,045
You just tossed it to the wind.

612
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:22,172
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

613
00:34:33,486 --> 00:34:34,567
God damn it.

614
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,217
He's in the wash!

615
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:42,937
Go, go, go!

616
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:51,496
Come on, let's flush him out!

617
00:35:02,328 --> 00:35:04,091
Where you going, Stigman?

618
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,173
It doesn't matter if you run.

619
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:13,814
Your jacket's wired, so you're
six-months AWOL after stabbing an MP.

620
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,968
You talk to anyone,
they're just gonna

621
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:18,539
hand you right back over to me.

622
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:27,656
You all right?

623
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:30,092
Yeah.
Then get your ass up!

624
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:41,410
Toss the gun.

625
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,531
Fuck!

626
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,531
Move!

627
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,171
Come on, come on!

628
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,217
Damn it!

629
00:36:42,893 --> 00:36:45,782
Jesus! What am I supposed
to do with this?

630
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:49,097
Aw, man. Aw!

631
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:50,858
Come on.

632
00:36:51,732 --> 00:36:54,259
I'm a vet,
not a trauma surgeon.

633
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:56,894
I can't help you with this, man.
You gotta go.

634
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:58,054
Go where?

635
00:36:58,213 --> 00:37:00,022
You gotta leave.
I can't do anything.

636
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:01,662
Kenny, you remember
a couple of months ago

637
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:04,902
you offered to sell me
500 hits of ketamine?

638
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:06,612
Yeah, you said you
weren't interested.

639
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:07,774
Right.

640
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:09,662
'Cause I'm a DEA agent.

641
00:37:12,454 --> 00:37:14,263
And if you don't fix me up,

642
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:16,579
I'm gonna go to the D.A.,

643
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:20,135
I'm gonna tell them that you like
cruising Tori Amos concerts,

644
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,258
selling Special K to little
weepy college girls.

645
00:37:23,414 --> 00:37:24,620
There's no way you're a cop.

646
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:25,821
No?
No.

647
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:27,214
You sure?
I'm positive.

648
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,616
You have the right
to remain silent.

649
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:35,413
You have the right to have a
lawyer present during questioning.

650
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:36,453
Do I need to keep going?

651
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,213
No, I'm good. You're a cop.

652
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,420
Okay.
Okay.

653
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,141
Nice shirt.

654
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:43,945
Thanks. It's JCPenney's.

655
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,256
Yeah?
Yeah.

656
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:46,854
All right, hold on one second.

657
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:23,455
Welcome to the Camino Real.

658
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:24,662
Thank you.

659
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:35,858
Hey.

660
00:38:36,177 --> 00:38:37,667
You were late.
Jesus Christ.

661
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,149
What the hell happened?

662
00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:41,106
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me.

663
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:44,176
I robbed a bank.
What happened to you?

664
00:38:44,177 --> 00:38:45,702
I was there with
six agents at 3:05.

665
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,188
No, you weren't.
Yes, I was.

666
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:48,377
You were late.

667
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:49,664
You went early.

668
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:50,977
And it's not as if
you couldn't have

669
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:52,946
pulled your badge at any
time and stopped it.

670
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:54,817
I did. Stig shot me.
What?

671
00:38:54,818 --> 00:38:56,626
He shot me in the shoulder.

672
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:57,939
We gotta take you
to the hospital.

673
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:00,459
And interrupt your rendezvous with Harvey?
I don't think so.

674
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:01,909
This is what we need to do,

675
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:04,379
we need to find Stig,
we need to find the money.

676
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:10,220
All right. Listen.

677
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:12,897
Let me go upstairs,
make my excuses,

678
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,184
and then we'll find
Stig together, okay?

679
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:16,147
Okay, let's do this.
Let's do this.

680
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:17,949
Why don't you recheck
Stig's background?

681
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,261
Maybe there was something that we missed.
All right?

682
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,941
I'm going to Stig's apartment
and see what I can find out.

683
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:26,141
All right?
Okay.

684
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,590
Tell Harvey I said hi.

685
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,144
Who'd you patch up?

686
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,430
What are you talking about?

687
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,663
What am I talkin' about?

688
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,622
Well, there's a dune
buggy parked out back

689
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,346
that was stolen by a man
with a bullet hole in him.

690
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,431
Now, before he had
a bullet hole in him,

691
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,507
he burned down a diner
and robbed a bank.

692
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,782
I don't know anything
about that, so...

693
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,508
Okay.

694
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:07,460
Okay?

695
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:08,542
Fair enough.

696
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:11,785
Say, let me ask you somethin'.

697
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:15,832
You ever play Russian roulette?

698
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:21,349
'Course not.
What am I thinkin'?

699
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:25,024
The thing is, most people,

700
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:27,824
they put the gun to the temple.

701
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,953
And that's, well,
that's just stupid.

702
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:32,828
What if...

703
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:38,303
The bullet's in
the first chamber?

704
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:42,821
You blow a man's head off
'fore he's had a chance

705
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:44,905
to tell you
what you want to know.

706
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:50,582
No. No, no.
Come on, man.

707
00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:56,389
Case in point.

708
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:01,429
Stig!

709
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,626
Stig.

710
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,310
<i>Pick up, Bobby.</i>

711
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:30,546
<i>What the fuck are you
doing here, Bobby?</i>

712
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:36,224
<i>What're you duckin' for, man?</i>

713
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:37,875
<i>You know I set you up, right?</i>

714
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,434
<i>They told me all about you.</i>

715
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:43,993
<i>Tough cat. Knows everybody.
Doesn't have people.</i>

716
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:47,070
That guy? Well, shit, that
guy's a perfect cut-out.

717
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:49,387
I mean, he takes a bullet,
who's gonna care, right?

718
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:52,397
Pick up the phone.

719
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:54,392
<i>Pick up the damn phone, Bobby.</i>

720
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,626
You got anything to say?

721
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:02,785
<i>First question,</i>

722
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,305
if you're DEA and you're
clean, why are you here alone?

723
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:06,990
Where's your backup, Bobby?

724
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,746
Come on, it's this
kind of attitude

725
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:12,588
makes me think you're not
one of the good guys.

726
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:15,985
<i>If I wanted you,
I could've had you</i>

727
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:18,148
<i>before you walked into
that building, Bobby.</i>

728
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,795
<i>That's a beautiful rifle, Stig.</i>

729
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:34,358
<i>Is that Army issue?</i>

730
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:37,033
You like that? No, it's Kmart.
Blue Light Special.

731
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,316
Now answer my question.
Where's your backup?

732
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,869
No, no,
that's a military rifle.

733
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:44,634
<i>What's the military doing
robbing banks, Stig?</i>

734
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:48,347
Can we just have a straight-up
conversation, Bobby?

735
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:49,952
I got you dead to rights.

736
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,874
<i>Yeah? So shoot me.</i>

737
00:42:53,348 --> 00:42:54,474
<i>Again.</i>

738
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:57,389
<i>No?</i>

739
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,034
<i>I'll shoot myself.</i>

740
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:09,028
Huh. Not bad.

741
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:10,190
<i>I'm glad you're impressed.</i>

742
00:43:11,149 --> 00:43:14,188
Were you testing me to
see if I would shoot first?

743
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:15,634
<i>Where's the money, Stig?</i>

744
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,709
If I thought you were clean, I might
tell you, but I don't, so I can't.

745
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,316
<i>You're lying. You don't have it, do you?
Where's the money?</i>

746
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:24,071
<i>Oh, shit.
What?</i>

747
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,948
You're not the only
one I was expecting.

748
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:27,349
Three very nasty men
just showed up.

749
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,430
If they find you in my
place, they will get ugly.

750
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,671
<i>Who are they?</i>

751
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,109
Yesterday I'd have said
they were my family.

752
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,549
Today they kinda wanna kill me.

753
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,234
<i>- I understand the feeling.
- You know, fuck you.</i>

754
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,274
What do you know about family?
You don't even have people.

755
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:38,589
No, Bobby,
that's a stupid idea.

756
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,671
They're already
comin' up the stairs.

757
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,070
<i>Bobby!</i>

758
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,520
I told you.
Now, Bobby,

759
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,790
<i>hang up the speaker and
answer your cell phone, okay?</i>

760
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:00,397
<i>If you want me to help you out...</i>

761
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:08,271
Yeah.

762
00:44:08,272 --> 00:44:09,353
<i>Just stay in the shadows, okay?</i>

763
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:10,837
<i>I'm gonna guide
you out from there.</i>

764
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:13,557
<i>Wait.</i>

765
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,753
<i>Wait.</i>

766
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:24,071
He's comin' up your rear. You
better dart across the hall.

767
00:44:24,072 --> 00:44:25,882
Go over to the bedroom
and hide behind the lockers.

768
00:44:26,073 --> 00:44:27,120
<i>Go.</i>

769
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:35,678
All right, Bobby, you're gonna
wanna scoot across the hall. Go.

770
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:47,872
<i>Bobby, Bob...</i>

771
00:45:00,474 --> 00:45:01,634
Shit.

772
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:12,799
- Teemo!
- Rooftop!

773
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,800
Target's on the move!

774
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:28,116
Sorry, Teemo.

Where's our money?

779
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:21,000
I have no idea what
you're talkin' about.

780
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:24,807
You think DEA can just
waltz into our bank,

781
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,204
steal our money, and we're not gonna kick?

782
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:32,365
Your man Bobby Trench stole
43 million of our dollars.

783
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:34,282
We'd like it back.

784
00:46:34,518 --> 00:46:36,407
Because it's our money.

785
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:39,402
Because it's a blatant
act of disrespect.

786
00:46:39,718 --> 00:46:41,686
And because it's our money.

787
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:51,039
Please tell me it's you, Bobby.

788
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,202
Anything new on Stig?

789
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,124
He's comin' up clean on every
database I'm cleared for.

790
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,565
No military connection?
No record of service?

791
00:46:58,718 --> 00:47:01,290
To go deeper, I'd need to
get clearance from Jessup.

792
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:04,718
Well, try your old
contacts in the military.

793
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,483
I'm gonna tell Jessup
everything I know.

794
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:07,879
Wait, are you sure?

795
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:10,566
<i>Someone has to know whose
money was in the bank.</i>

796
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,960
Yeah. Stig.

797
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,719
Stig didn't even
know I was DEA.

798
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,245
Besides, somebody
tried to kill him, too.

799
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:18,163
Bobby, let me help you.
What do you need?

800
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,731
Take it easy. Bye.

801
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,126
Bobby.

802
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,481
Fuck!

803
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:46,964
That's how you take down a man.
Now shut the door.

804
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:57,932
Just let it come.

805
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:06,169
Agent Robert Lynn Trench.

806
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:11,012
A.k.a. Bobby T, a.k.a. Bobby B, a.k.a.
Bobby Beans.

807
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:16,773
Let's have a chat.

808
00:48:36,484 --> 00:48:40,562
You stole $43125 million

809
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:42,804
that did not belong to you.

810
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:45,568
Now, man-to-man,

811
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,646
who at DEA authorized
you to rob our bank?

812
00:48:52,524 --> 00:48:54,048
You a banker?

813
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:59,331
You ever play Russian roulette?

814
00:49:02,124 --> 00:49:03,364
Thing is,

815
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:08,370
most people put the gun
to the temple.

816
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:11,527
Well, that's just stupid.

817
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:19,604
You blow a man's head off
'fore he's had a chance

818
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:21,812
to tell you
what you wanna know.

819
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,415
Mess up your suit, too.

820
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:44,845
Who told you it was all
right to take our money?

821
00:49:45,926 --> 00:49:47,974
"Our money. Our bank."

822
00:49:50,406 --> 00:49:51,567
Who are ya?

823
00:49:51,926 --> 00:49:54,055
If you don't know who I am,

824
00:49:55,047 --> 00:49:57,414
how did you know to
steal our 43 million?

825
00:49:57,567 --> 00:49:59,331
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

826
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:01,136
You don't?
No.

827
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:02,728
Well...

828
00:50:04,407 --> 00:50:05,613
Where's the money?

829
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:07,098
Oh, boy.

830
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:09,418
Well, uh...

831
00:50:11,247 --> 00:50:13,615
it ain't down there,
I can guarantee you that.

832
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:26,738
Whoo-hoo.

833
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:29,247
A.k.a. Bobby Balls.

834
00:50:29,248 --> 00:50:30,773
Clean and shaven.

835
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:43,499
You know what you are?

836
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:47,815
You

837
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:51,170
are a dirty DEA agent.

838
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:53,300
That's right.

839
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:57,296
You're a dirty DEA agent
who robbed a bank.

840
00:50:57,529 --> 00:50:58,974
And shot your boss.

841
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,291
You walk into
any federal office,

842
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:17,859
and that's the story
they're gonna have.

843
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:26,896
Unless you bring me
$43.125 million,

844
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,462
and you walk away.
Clean.

845
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:37,134
Have I properly
incentivized you?

846
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,740
More than you know.

847
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:43,693
Unless you wanna rot in jail,
you best get after it.

848
00:51:48,131 --> 00:51:50,453
Go on, now. Go on.

849
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:01,013
All right.

850
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:08,302
You're thinkin'
he deserved better?

851
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:09,973
You're right.

852
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:35,024
Hey, Rudy.

853
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:36,939
<i>Hola, Javier.</i>

854
00:52:45,933 --> 00:52:47,345
Morning, Papi.

855
00:52:47,494 --> 00:52:48,495
Don't move.

856
00:52:48,654 --> 00:52:49,893
Go inside, quick.

857
00:52:49,894 --> 00:52:50,895
Mommy!

858
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,495
Whose money did we steal?

859
00:52:52,654 --> 00:52:53,655
You really wanna know?

860
00:52:53,814 --> 00:52:55,339
I really wanna know.

861
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:05,093
Easy, old man, get in there.
Get in there.

862
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:06,096
Payback's a bitch!

863
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:09,414
Payback's a bitch!

864
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:10,454
Uh, uh, uh.

865
00:53:10,455 --> 00:53:12,614
- Whoa, Bobby.
- Drop the gun. Give me the keys.

866
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:14,134
Give me the keys.
Nice and easy.

867
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:15,103
I can't do that.

868
00:53:15,216 --> 00:53:17,255
Why not? Well, I got him first.
I got dibs.

869
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:19,814
I got a .44. I'm taking Papi.
Give me the keys.

870
00:53:19,815 --> 00:53:22,136
You want 'em?
Come get 'em.

871
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:23,494
Now, I see the wheels turnin'.

872
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:25,615
You're thinkin' a little
blindfold, maybe use your teeth.

873
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:27,903
That's not what I'm thinkin'.
You know what I'm thinkin'?

874
00:53:28,776 --> 00:53:30,619
Oh, shit, man.
How's that?

875
00:53:30,776 --> 00:53:32,380
That was uncalled for.

876
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:34,776
Shit. I liked you better when
you were "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

877
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:36,455
That Bobby was a good guy.

878
00:53:36,456 --> 00:53:38,535
Well, I liked you better when
you were winkin' at waitresses

879
00:53:38,536 --> 00:53:40,255
and shootin' the heads
off of chickens.

880
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:42,099
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

881
00:53:43,576 --> 00:53:45,420
- Shit!
- What's going on?

882
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:47,579
You saw that move comin'? That's correct.
Give me the keys.

883
00:53:47,817 --> 00:53:49,262
Damn, you're good.

884
00:53:49,537 --> 00:53:51,537
Now, one of us is gonna
have to pick up those keys.

885
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,543
Guess. All right. I'll
get 'em, all right?

886
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:56,377
Get 'em, get 'em. Put
that musket away, man.

887
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,987
- Hey, pull over!
- Pull over?

888
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,867
Hey, Papi, you like my drivin'?

889
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,025
Oh, shit!

890
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:43,386
Come on, Bobby,
I ain't got all damn day!

891
00:55:30,822 --> 00:55:32,027
What do you wanna do?

892
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:52,069
Ow!

893
00:56:07,862 --> 00:56:09,786
All right. All right, all right.
All right, let me go.

894
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:10,982
You let me go first.

895
00:56:10,983 --> 00:56:12,030
No, you let me go.

896
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:13,794
On three.
On three.

897
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,588
One. Two. Three.

898
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:19,423
See? Now you're making me
not be able to trust you.

899
00:56:19,424 --> 00:56:21,028
On the count of three,
we'll let each other go.

900
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,422
All right?
All right. That's fair.

901
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:23,629
One. Two.

902
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:24,784
Three.

903
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:27,022
I knew it.
Let me go.

904
00:56:27,023 --> 00:56:29,263
No! I'm gonna let you go.
I'm gonna let you go.

905
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:30,550
All right.
One...

906
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:36,149
Ow!

907
00:56:36,704 --> 00:56:37,752
Ow!

908
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:41,274
Come on, man. You gotta admit,
that was kind of fun, no?

909
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,635
You didn't like that?

910
00:56:43,944 --> 00:56:45,150
Who are you?

911
00:56:45,504 --> 00:56:46,585
Shit.

912
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:50,674
U.S. Navy Intel.
Yeah?

913
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,065
Or I was.

914
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:54,584
My commander FUBARed my jacket.

915
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:56,663
And now I'm AWOL
after stabbing an MP.

916
00:56:56,664 --> 00:57:00,272
You're lucky. They got me
framed for killing my boss.

917
00:57:00,505 --> 00:57:02,786
Did your boss order your four
closest friends to kill you?

918
00:57:04,065 --> 00:57:05,715
No, you got me there.

919
00:57:06,145 --> 00:57:07,716
Petty Officer Michael Stigman.

920
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:13,035
DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but I
guess you know that already.

921
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:14,186
Pleasure.

922
00:57:14,345 --> 00:57:16,705
So, what, you just
happened to pick me,

923
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:18,674
or you got orders to
set me up on purpose?

924
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:20,945
I had orders, man. I
didn't know you were DEA.

925
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:22,145
My people did.
But they're Intel.

926
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:23,345
There's not much
they don't know.

927
00:57:23,346 --> 00:57:24,585
Your people?

928
00:57:24,586 --> 00:57:25,826
Now I'm just trying to
piece together the truth,

929
00:57:25,827 --> 00:57:28,025
so I can take it over my
commander's head to the Admiral.

930
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:30,506
That's why they wanna kill me and
why I wanted to talk to Papi.

931
00:57:30,986 --> 00:57:32,067
Right.

932
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:33,832
Well...

933
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:38,348
I guess we can both talk
to him at the same time.

934
00:57:38,507 --> 00:57:39,706
What, like we're
workin' together?

935
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,146
No, not like we're
working together.

936
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:43,912
No, like we're workin'
in the same vicinity.

937
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,066
Together.
In the same area code.

938
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:47,586
Together.
The same county.

939
00:57:47,587 --> 00:57:49,589
<i>And don't get all We Are
The World on me either.</i>

940
00:57:49,707 --> 00:57:52,506
When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.
But we're partners.

941
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,186
<i>Come on, man, Ebony and Ivory.</i>

942
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:56,236
Shit, I think he puked.
He's puked or he's dead.

943
00:57:57,588 --> 00:57:59,033
Oh, yeah, he puked.

944
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:00,509
Hey.

945
00:58:02,587 --> 00:58:05,027
I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you both.

946
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:06,347
This might take a while.

947
00:58:06,348 --> 00:58:07,838
I got all day, partner.

948
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,227
Hold on.

949
00:58:09,228 --> 00:58:11,148
Let me put that in there with ya.
Put that on ya.

950
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:19,995
So, partner,
how you wanna do this?

951
00:58:20,108 --> 00:58:21,987
I like that, it's got a nice
roll off your tongue there.

952
00:58:21,988 --> 00:58:25,357
We're not that close. Don't kumbaya with me.
Don't kumbaya.

953
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:28,628
I'm gonna get my bucket and
towel and waterboard his ass.

954
00:58:28,629 --> 00:58:31,268
No, we gotta give him a chance to talk.
You got anything to say?

955
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:33,389
I hope you guys like
the taste of balls,

956
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:36,791
because I'm gonna chop yours
off, stuff 'em in your mouths.

957
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:37,948
See?

958
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:41,317
Or maybe I'll put yours
in his and his in yours.

959
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:42,949
Want me to get the bucket?

960
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,111
Kumbaya.

961
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,471
So why were you puttin' so
much money in Tres Cruces?

962
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,394
<i>It's Tres Cruces.</i>

963
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:54,401
We thought you just stashed
a little cash there

964
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,360
until we robbed the place,
found 40 million. Why is that?

965
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:58,869
<i>You robbed Tres Cruces?</i>

966
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,309
That's correct.
Why is that?

967
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:04,678
That's funny, huh?

968
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,991
You're dead.

969
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:08,069
Yeah, that is funny, isn't it?
You're both dead.

970
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,359
And I didn't even
have to kill you.

971
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:16,156
I thought you were sharp.
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

972
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:17,592
But you...

973
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:20,040
You just ripped off the CIA.

974
00:59:23,912 --> 00:59:25,322
The CIA?

975
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,950
The CIA.

976
00:59:26,951 --> 00:59:29,390
He's full of crap. Why would he have
money in the same bank as the CIA?

977
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,511
Why would you have money in
the same bank as the CIA?

978
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:32,843
I don't have shit in that bank.

979
00:59:33,232 --> 00:59:35,991
The only money I
deliver to Tres Cruces

980
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:38,074
is a payment.
To the CIA?

981
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:42,558
The CIA. They take
7% of my revenue.

982
00:59:42,672 --> 00:59:45,631
In return, they let
me use their planes

983
00:59:45,632 --> 00:59:47,282
so I can get my shit
across the border.

984
00:59:49,272 --> 00:59:52,834
I could do it a lot cheaper, but
there was really no negotiations.

985
00:59:52,953 --> 00:59:54,034
You know...

986
00:59:54,953 --> 00:59:57,240
They take it from
all the cartels.

987
00:59:57,792 --> 00:59:59,032
Bullshit.

988
00:59:59,272 --> 01:00:00,434
Okay.

989
01:00:01,153 --> 01:00:02,564
They're still gonna kill you.

990
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:12,000
Bobby?

991
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:14,517
You said stop by anytime.

992
01:00:14,953 --> 01:00:17,672
You kidnapped a drug kingpin!
That's correct.

993
01:00:17,673 --> 01:00:20,518
Papi Greco! And you tied
him up in my garage!

994
01:00:20,874 --> 01:00:22,478
Sorry. What do you...

995
01:00:26,714 --> 01:00:27,954
You mind if I swipe a yogurt?

996
01:00:28,154 --> 01:00:31,593
Yeah, sure. Please. Help yourself to anything.
Take whatever you want.

997
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,793
It's just a yogurt.

998
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:34,319
But it's her yogurt.
Just put it back.

999
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,721
Please.

1000
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,074
Are you two like
ex-boyfriend and girlfriend?

1001
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:42,634
Actually, you know what?
We never put a name on it.

1002
01:00:42,635 --> 01:00:44,554
So, what, you broke his
heart or he broke yours?

1003
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:47,478
Wow, this guy will really ask
anyone anything at anytime.

1004
01:00:47,594 --> 01:00:49,394
Why don't you go and
check on Papi, huh?

1005
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,516
What do you see in this guy?

1006
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:54,074
I could go on for
hours, but I don't know you,

1007
01:00:54,075 --> 01:00:55,594
and I don't think
this is the right time

1008
01:00:55,595 --> 01:00:57,120
for us to have this
conversation, okay?

1009
01:00:57,235 --> 01:00:59,035
So daddy issues, huh?

1010
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:00,083
Daddy!

1011
01:01:00,676 --> 01:01:03,407
Garage. Papi. Go.

1012
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:05,365
I get it now.
Go. Go to the garage.

1013
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:07,962
Can I have the yogurt? You
can have the yogurt. Here.

1014
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:10,195
I don't like her, man.
You don't get a vote.

1015
01:01:10,196 --> 01:01:11,357
I'm gonna watch her.

1016
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:14,600
Bobby.
What are you doing?

1017
01:01:16,236 --> 01:01:18,205
Are you 100% sure
you can trust this guy?

1018
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:20,678
No. But he's all
the help I got.

1019
01:01:21,476 --> 01:01:22,557
Jessup's dead.

1020
01:01:23,836 --> 01:01:27,683
The money we stole was CIA money.
They came lookin' for it.

1021
01:01:28,157 --> 01:01:31,161
I'm sorry, Deb, I didn't mean to
get you involved in all this.

1022
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:35,958
You okay?

1023
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:42,647
What are you smirking at?

1024
01:01:44,957 --> 01:01:46,837
You know, I've been
racking my brain

1025
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:48,488
trying to figure out
who you look like.

1026
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,208
And it finally dawned on me.

1027
01:01:50,478 --> 01:01:52,958
You look like a Mexican
Albert Einstein.

1028
01:01:53,078 --> 01:01:55,045
Minus the genius factor,
obviously.

1029
01:01:55,277 --> 01:01:56,643
You want some yogurt?

1030
01:01:57,478 --> 01:01:58,764
Payback's a bitch.

1031
01:02:01,438 --> 01:02:02,724
That's for Little Toro.

1032
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,521
Stig.

1033
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:55,608
Stig!

1034
01:02:56,081 --> 01:02:57,200
Pack it up!

1035
01:02:57,201 --> 01:02:58,202
Move it, move it!

1036
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,884
Stig.
The one and only.

1037
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,080
That your people?

1038
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:04,321
Do you have to
say it like that?

1039
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,006
Like what? They're
your people, right?

1040
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,641
Technically, yes, but I thought
you were my people now.

1041
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:10,880
All right, two taps, we'll
hit the garage. On go.

1042
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:12,611
Okay. On your go.
Go!

1043
01:03:38,762 --> 01:03:39,809
Fuck.

1044
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:43,042
What was that about?

1045
01:03:43,043 --> 01:03:44,204
That was messed up.

1046
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,522
What the hell is going on?

1047
01:03:45,523 --> 01:03:46,649
I don't know.

1048
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:49,454
I don't know.

1049
01:03:51,763 --> 01:03:53,208
Give me your phone, now.

1050
01:03:55,323 --> 01:03:58,442
I'll take the car, too.
Get out. Get out!

1051
01:03:58,443 --> 01:03:59,490
Oh, my God.

1052
01:04:13,284 --> 01:04:15,446
<i>EstÃ¡ en un gray Charger.</i>

1053
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,487
How did Stig's people know
to come to your house?

1054
01:04:24,244 --> 01:04:26,883
I don't know. They must
have followed you.

1055
01:04:26,884 --> 01:04:28,003
I don't think so.

1056
01:04:28,004 --> 01:04:29,363
We would have seen 'em.

1057
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:30,366
We should have seen 'em.

1058
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:33,367
How'd they know to
come to your house?

1059
01:04:33,805 --> 01:04:34,852
Hmm?

1060
01:04:41,405 --> 01:04:43,084
Why were they
at your house, Debbie?

1061
01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:44,416
No. You serious?

1062
01:04:46,605 --> 01:04:47,606
Bobby...

1063
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:28,138
<i>Out of the car, gabacho.</i>

1064
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:29,368
Hurry up.

1065
01:05:29,687 --> 01:05:31,530
<i>You fucked up now, ese.</i>

1066
01:05:32,047 --> 01:05:33,253
On your knees.

1067
01:05:42,528 --> 01:05:44,610
I know some guys, too, Bobby.

1068
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,210
Bag 'em up.
Let's take 'em home.

1069
01:05:55,048 --> 01:05:56,888
Do you wanna talk about it? No.

1070
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:58,379
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

1071
01:05:59,609 --> 01:06:00,728
I told you I didn't
like her, man.

1072
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:01,810
Shut up.

1073
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:03,367
What are you
gettin' mad at me for?

1074
01:06:03,368 --> 01:06:04,687
Because you talk too much.

1075
01:06:04,688 --> 01:06:05,727
What'd I ever do to you?

1076
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,254
Besides shoot me?

1077
01:06:08,129 --> 01:06:09,648
You know what you are?
You're a misanthorpe.

1078
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:11,328
It's misanthrope.
I'm a misanthrope.

1079
01:06:11,329 --> 01:06:13,568
Did you know what
I meant to say?

1080
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,128
No. What did you
mean to say?

1081
01:06:15,129 --> 01:06:16,973
That you don't like people.
Shut up.

1082
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:25,769
Time for my massage.

1083
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:28,614
Yeah. I'll have housekeeping
clean up your bed.

1084
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,217
Oh, shit.

1085
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:41,289
My grandfather cut cane for 30
years every day and never got a blister.

1086
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,459
Says it smells like hell,

1087
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:46,735
toughens the hands.

1088
01:06:47,611 --> 01:06:49,530
You know what
I like about this?

1089
01:06:49,531 --> 01:06:52,739
Not only do I get to take
my time with you guys,

1090
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:56,492
but this time, I don't have to
worry about leaving any marks.

1091
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:58,495
Don't put your
hands on me, man.

1092
01:06:59,931 --> 01:07:01,933
Shit.
What did you say?

1093
01:07:02,091 --> 01:07:04,459
Just don't put those
pissy hands on me, man.

1094
01:07:07,892 --> 01:07:09,212
You ain't got a home, Bobby.

1095
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,970
DEA doesn't want you around.

1096
01:07:11,971 --> 01:07:13,132
Not with your sins.

1097
01:07:15,492 --> 01:07:16,651
Payback's a bitch.

1098
01:07:16,652 --> 01:07:18,620
You smell like
warm Corona, man.

1099
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:28,052
You remember
my prize breeding bull.

1100
01:07:28,452 --> 01:07:31,217
With cojones
the size of coconuts.

1101
01:07:31,532 --> 01:07:32,819
You wanna see him?

1102
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:34,543
No, it's okay.
We can see good from here.

1103
01:07:34,653 --> 01:07:35,984
<i>AdiÃ³s, Bobby.</i>

1104
01:07:36,173 --> 01:07:37,254
No, no.

1105
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,059
Shit!

1106
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,494
$43 million!

1107
01:07:52,614 --> 01:07:54,133
It's everything
we stole from the CIA.

1108
01:07:54,134 --> 01:07:55,853
You let us go,
we'll bring it to you.

1109
01:07:58,693 --> 01:07:59,854
I got the money.

1110
01:07:59,973 --> 01:08:01,573
What are you talking about?
I got it.

1111
01:08:01,574 --> 01:08:03,733
You don't have it! I know I don't have it.
He doesn't know that.

1112
01:08:03,734 --> 01:08:04,933
But you don't have the money.

1113
01:08:04,934 --> 01:08:06,613
I know you don't have it,
'cause I have it.

1114
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:07,733
You have it?
Well, where is it?

1115
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:08,701
Commander Quince's safe.

1116
01:08:08,814 --> 01:08:11,095
Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.
Don't tell me. Tell him.

1117
01:08:11,895 --> 01:08:13,021
Oh, shit!

1118
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,336
Where is it?

1119
01:08:15,694 --> 01:08:18,061
Commander Quince's safe! Corpus
Christi Naval Air Station!

1120
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:22,894
The guy's pissing on us, and you're
askin' if we should fuckin' tell him.

1121
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,944
If that's the truth, I might
as well just kill you now.

1122
01:08:40,536 --> 01:08:43,585
I had a run-in with a couple
boys out of your organization.

1123
01:08:44,056 --> 01:08:45,057
Hello, Earl.

1124
01:08:46,216 --> 01:08:50,380
Mr. Bobby Beans
and Mr. Michael Stigman.

1125
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:53,620
Well, they're not
from my organization.

1126
01:08:53,856 --> 01:08:55,540
They're freelancers.

1127
01:08:55,816 --> 01:08:58,422
And Bobby Beans
is undercover DEA.

1128
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:01,498
And Mr. Stigman's
AWOL U.S. Navy.

1129
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:07,295
They stole 43.125 million
from the Tres Cruces.

1130
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:08,775
We want it back.

1131
01:09:08,776 --> 01:09:10,256
Is there a finder's fee?

1132
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:12,056
Fee is we let you
continue to do business.

1133
01:09:12,057 --> 01:09:14,742
Fee is we don't raise
our cut from 7% to 20.

1134
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:19,217
The fee is we don't come down here
with a squad of Apache A-6 helicopters

1135
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:20,947
and wipe you off
the face of the earth.

1136
01:09:21,418 --> 01:09:24,580
You like my country weak
and corrupt, don't you?

1137
01:09:25,377 --> 01:09:27,903
So you can buy your
cheap crap at the mall.

1138
01:09:29,658 --> 01:09:31,467
Well, Earl, I'm not cheap.

1139
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,586
Is this about pride, Manny?

1140
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:37,017
About machismo?

1141
01:09:37,018 --> 01:09:39,259
Prove you got
a big Mexican cock?

1142
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:42,617
Well, your cock is huge.
It's massive.

1143
01:09:42,618 --> 01:09:45,622
And I, I'm in awe of your cock.

1144
01:09:45,738 --> 01:09:48,424
So what? You're still
a drug dealer.

1145
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:51,743
And I'm still the government
of the United States.

1146
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:55,108
It's a free market, Manny.

1147
01:09:55,898 --> 01:09:57,424
Not a free world.

1148
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:00,698
I'll take a look.

1149
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:02,827
Hard!
You'll look hard.

1150
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,829
Under every rock in Mexico.

1151
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,509
Let's get out of this shithole.

1152
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,710
I've decided to let you
bring me the 43 million.

1153
01:10:37,341 --> 01:10:38,940
The truck'll take you
north to the border.

1154
01:10:38,941 --> 01:10:41,980
From there, you'll cross
on foot with the coyotes.

1155
01:10:41,981 --> 01:10:43,267
If it's all the same,
we'd rather drive.

1156
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:45,420
With everybody lookin' for you,

1157
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:46,820
they'd pull you out
of line in two seconds.

1158
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:48,152
No, you go the way
you force my people.

1159
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:49,660
If we can't risk crossing,

1160
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:50,900
how are we supposed to
bring you back the money?

1161
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:53,142
I'll meet you north
of the border in 24 hours.

1162
01:10:55,542 --> 01:11:00,184
Now, I'm trusting you to fulfill
your part of the bargain.

1163
01:11:10,742 --> 01:11:11,743
Hey, Bobby.

1164
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:15,113
You got 24 hours
to bring me the money.

1165
01:11:15,223 --> 01:11:17,066
Or I'm gonna shoot her
right in the head.

1166
01:11:18,222 --> 01:11:20,141
Then I'm gonna find you,

1167
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,304
and I'm gonna
gut you like a pig!

1168
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,000

Stig!

1172
01:12:57,946 --> 01:12:59,914
When this is over,
I'm still gonna shoot you.

1173
01:13:01,027 --> 01:13:02,791
Whatever it takes, Bobby.

1174
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:14,026
Pick one.
I can get in anything.

1175
01:13:14,027 --> 01:13:15,426
So, what about the Audi?

1176
01:13:15,427 --> 01:13:18,346
No, I don't do German, okay? Locks
are tricky, too many alarms.

1177
01:13:18,347 --> 01:13:19,873
Okay. Suburban?

1178
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,187
That one's 2010.

1179
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,429
It's gonna get like two miles a gallon.
I ain't payin' for all that gas.

1180
01:13:23,548 --> 01:13:25,312
For a car thief, you
are mighty particular.

1181
01:13:25,508 --> 01:13:26,669
I'll break into the Honda.

1182
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:28,307
I look like I'm gonna ride
in that Honda to you?

1183
01:13:28,308 --> 01:13:29,468
You could.

1184
01:13:29,469 --> 01:13:31,107
And you could pick somethin'
with a little more class.

1185
01:13:31,108 --> 01:13:32,507
I hate to remind you,
but we're breakin'

1186
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:33,787
onto a high-security
Navy base.

1187
01:13:33,788 --> 01:13:35,027
We ain't goin'
to the hip-hop opera.

1188
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:36,707
<i>It ain't no Les
MisÃ©rables for you tonight.</i>

1189
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:37,709
<i>Les MisÃ©rables!</i>

1190
01:13:37,828 --> 01:13:38,948
Oh, man,
whatever the fuck, man.

1191
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:40,028
Don't remind me.

1192
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:43,708
Look, it's not my fault Quince
took the money back to the base.

1193
01:13:43,709 --> 01:13:45,348
I thought you said you took
the money back to the base.

1194
01:13:45,349 --> 01:13:46,714
No, I never said that.

1195
01:13:47,068 --> 01:13:48,307
So the money could be anywhere.

1196
01:13:48,308 --> 01:13:50,228
It could be in East Jabip,
the Cayman Islands...

1197
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:51,708
No, the money
is on the base, okay?

1198
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:53,548
I gave it to Commander
Quince at the Camino Real,

1199
01:13:53,549 --> 01:13:55,068
and he told the guys
to take it back to the base.

1200
01:13:55,069 --> 01:13:57,197
Right before he took you
out and tried to kill you.

1201
01:13:57,909 --> 01:13:59,749
That doesn't mean
he's lyin' about the base.

1202
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:02,909
Not everybody's as paranoid
as you, Bobby. Jeez.

1203
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,230
What about the Prius?
You like the Prius?

1204
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:07,355
Camino Real.

1205
01:14:07,469 --> 01:14:08,710
Yeah, it's a hotel.

1206
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,029
I met Debbie
at the Camino Real.

1207
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:12,031
No shit?

1208
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,390
Yeah.
What was she doin' there?

1209
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,590
She said she was there to
meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

1210
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,750
Wait. Your girlfriend
has a boyfriend?

1211
01:14:17,751 --> 01:14:19,082
She's not my girlfriend.

1212
01:14:20,071 --> 01:14:21,151
Holy shit.

1213
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,116
Yeah, just pick a car.

1214
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,036
Right here.

1215
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:27,832
You picked that one?

1216
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:28,952
Yeah.

1217
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,355
Fuck you want,
a fuckin' Bentley?

1218
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:32,957
I got it.

1219
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:52,036
Hi.
Hey.

1220
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,482
Crazy question,

1221
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:57,403
you wouldn't have anybody knows
how to fix a snowmobile?

1222
01:14:57,552 --> 01:14:58,553
I don't think so.

1223
01:14:58,712 --> 01:15:01,071
Would you check for me? I really
need it fixed by tonight.

1224
01:15:01,072 --> 01:15:02,483
Why, a big storm coming?

1225
01:15:02,712 --> 01:15:04,521
You never can be too sure.

1226
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:06,794
I'll be right back.

1227
01:15:08,553 --> 01:15:10,077
Up with that?
What?

1228
01:15:10,232 --> 01:15:12,200
She smiled at you,
you didn't wink at her?

1229
01:15:12,432 --> 01:15:14,275
I don't wink
at every woman I see.

1230
01:15:14,432 --> 01:15:18,040
Snowmobile in Texas, huh? You must
be in some serious shit, sailor.

1231
01:15:18,273 --> 01:15:19,553
You got yourself
a new claw, huh?

1232
01:15:19,793 --> 01:15:21,795
Gimme claw. Give it a pound.
It's a beaut.

1233
01:15:21,953 --> 01:15:23,717
You still got
my rainy-day stash?

1234
01:15:23,873 --> 01:15:25,000
Yeah.

1235
01:15:28,993 --> 01:15:30,324
See ya later, Stig.

1236
01:15:30,513 --> 01:15:31,594
All right.

1237
01:15:34,554 --> 01:15:37,993
You know what they say, talk softly
and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

1238
01:15:37,994 --> 01:15:39,280
Wow.

1239
01:15:40,594 --> 01:15:42,005
Which one you want?

1240
01:15:42,194 --> 01:15:43,433
This one.

1241
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:45,278
What's your plan
for gettin' on the base?

1242
01:15:45,594 --> 01:15:46,641
I'm workin' on it.

1243
01:16:01,274 --> 01:16:03,153
Remember, once we get
to the command building,

1244
01:16:03,154 --> 01:16:04,834
Quince's office is first
floor, end of the hall.

1245
01:16:04,835 --> 01:16:06,994
If he's not in the field, that's
where he lives 18 hours a day.

1246
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,440
Right, right. But you
still haven't told me

1247
01:16:08,555 --> 01:16:10,194
what the plan is to
get through the gate.

1248
01:16:10,195 --> 01:16:12,721
I got a plan. I mean, I'm capable
of comin' up with a plan.

1249
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:13,915
I'm not sayin'
you're not capable,

1250
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:15,327
I'm just sayin' you haven't told me.
What is it?

1251
01:16:15,436 --> 01:16:16,925
I'm workin' on it.

1252
01:16:18,195 --> 01:16:19,401
Better work faster.

1253
01:16:25,556 --> 01:16:26,637
Much faster.

1254
01:16:29,076 --> 01:16:30,875
Move it up.
Quickly.

1255
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:31,877
Fuck it.

1256
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:33,483
Halt!

1257
01:16:33,636 --> 01:16:35,047
He's going through!

1258
01:16:35,956 --> 01:16:37,401
That fast enough for ya?

1259
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:41,637
Shit!

1260
01:16:43,837 --> 01:16:45,805
Let's go! Let's go!
On the radio now!

1261
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:47,043
Return to post!

1262
01:16:54,557 --> 01:16:55,676
That was your plan?

1263
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:56,876
Well, we're on the base,
aren't we?

1264
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:59,836
That's not a plan. Nobody in their
right mind breaks into a naval base.

1265
01:16:59,837 --> 01:17:01,597
That's why it's a brilliant plan.
No one expected it.

1266
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:04,637
You shoulda seen your face.
Damn, they were surprised.

1267
01:17:04,638 --> 01:17:06,276
Your stop comin' up.
I'll play decoy,

1268
01:17:06,277 --> 01:17:07,876
lead 'em away, try to get
to the Admiral, okay?

1269
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:10,483
All right. Things go wrong, I'll
see you back at the boat yard.

1270
01:17:10,677 --> 01:17:11,759
Things ain't goin' wrong.

1271
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:15,081
I'm gettin' a medal. I get to the
Admiral, I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

1272
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:18,678
You're gonna wish
me luck, aren't ya?

1273
01:17:18,798 --> 01:17:20,358
Come on, man, let's hear it!
Good luck.

1274
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:21,958
Quince's office
at the end of the hall.

1275
01:17:21,959 --> 01:17:24,279
Remember, first floor,
end of the hall!

1276
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:36,882
Halt!
Stop where you are!

1277
01:17:37,959 --> 01:17:39,638
We have a breach
at Status Hall!

1278
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:40,679
Go, go, go, go!

1279
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:43,444
Up the stairs!

1280
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,603
Sir, Petty Officer Michael
Stigman, ID number 540333.

1281
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,121
Wait a minute, what's the problem?

1282
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,522
Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to do that to you, man.

1283
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,367
Sir.

1284
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,886
I've been in service 12 years.

1285
01:17:56,999 --> 01:17:59,199
I've never stepped foot in an
officers' mess, much less crashed it.

1286
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,690
Please, sir, it's an emergency.

1287
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,885
Stand outside, please.

1288
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,928
Leave us alone.
Thank you, sir.

1289
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,479
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that, man.

1290
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,800
I didn't mean to hit you like that.
I apologize.

1291
01:18:10,801 --> 01:18:13,159
I'm listening,
sailor. Sit.

1292
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,366
Thank you, sir.

1293
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:21,601
- Try the Admiral again for me.
- Yes, sir.

1294
01:18:38,082 --> 01:18:39,481
And you believed
this stolen money

1295
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:42,406
would all be used
to fight drug cartels?

1296
01:18:42,562 --> 01:18:45,293
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came
down the valid chain of command.

1297
01:18:45,402 --> 01:18:47,325
Blind loyalty is not loyalty.

1298
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:49,162
I know that, sir,
and that's why I'm here.

1299
01:18:49,442 --> 01:18:51,361
Well, you've shown
a lot of tenacity

1300
01:18:51,362 --> 01:18:53,012
and a lot of guts
bringing this to me.

1301
01:18:53,282 --> 01:18:55,364
Thank you, sir. That means
the world comin' from you.

1302
01:18:56,042 --> 01:19:00,093
Unfortunately, there's
nothing I can do for you.

1303
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:02,521
Of course, sir. I mean, you
can just lock down the base.

1304
01:19:02,522 --> 01:19:03,762
You can arrest
Commander Quince.

1305
01:19:03,922 --> 01:19:06,767
The United States Navy
does not rob banks.

1306
01:19:06,923 --> 01:19:08,925
Its personnel
did not rob a bank.

1307
01:19:09,123 --> 01:19:12,730
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity
of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1308
01:19:12,963 --> 01:19:14,562
If there was money
taken from the bank

1309
01:19:14,563 --> 01:19:17,534
that was part of
an illegal CIA slush fund,

1310
01:19:17,684 --> 01:19:20,163
the Navy had no knowledge
the fund existed.

1311
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:24,602
Your jacket has you
six months AWOL?

1312
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:25,605
Yes, sir.

1313
01:19:25,964 --> 01:19:27,693
It's gonna stay that way.

1314
01:19:29,924 --> 01:19:33,974
Commander Quince's jacket will
likewise be amended so he's also AWOL,

1315
01:19:34,124 --> 01:19:36,411
making none of this
the Navy's problem.

1316
01:19:36,804 --> 01:19:38,772
Sir, this isn't right.

1317
01:19:38,924 --> 01:19:40,608
Well, I'd offer more,

1318
01:19:40,804 --> 01:19:42,243
but when the hand has gangrene,

1319
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,246
you chop it off
to save the body.

1320
01:19:45,005 --> 01:19:48,896
You don't keep the pinkie around
just because it meant well.

1321
01:19:57,485 --> 01:20:01,285
Have Petty Officer Stigman
dropped outside the main gate.

1322
01:20:02,725 --> 01:20:05,377
He sets foot on a military
base anywhere in the world,

1323
01:20:06,526 --> 01:20:08,096
I want him shot.

1324
01:20:08,246 --> 01:20:09,444
This is bullshit.

1325
01:20:09,445 --> 01:20:11,766
You know, men like me fight and die
on the orders of men like you!

1326
01:20:11,925 --> 01:20:14,770
Without us, those stars on your
shoulder are a fucking costume!

1327
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:34,488
Open the safe.

1328
01:20:34,607 --> 01:20:35,646
Does your boss know
you're doin' this?

1329
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:36,766
Open it.

1330
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:39,088
Or did the CIA kill her
like they did Jessup?

1331
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:41,366
What's it to you?

1332
01:20:41,367 --> 01:20:42,447
I don't like loose ends.

1333
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:43,614
Neither do I...

1334
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:45,974
Harvey.

1335
01:20:48,967 --> 01:20:50,048
Huh?

1336
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:52,571
Well, my mother
named me Harold.

1337
01:20:52,768 --> 01:20:55,169
I like Harvey. Harvey
has a nice ring to it.

1338
01:20:55,528 --> 01:20:57,098
Don't you like Harvey?

1339
01:20:57,768 --> 01:20:59,807
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Yes, you do.

1340
01:21:00,047 --> 01:21:02,210
Been to the Camino
Real Hotel lately?

1341
01:21:02,368 --> 01:21:03,494
Open the safe.

1342
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:11,527
Staging area cleared up!

1343
01:21:11,528 --> 01:21:12,650
Bring it through!

1344
01:21:25,769 --> 01:21:26,770
Where's the money?

1345
01:21:27,809 --> 01:21:29,299
You tell me where Deb is.

1346
01:21:29,489 --> 01:21:32,095
She's gettin' her nails done.
Where is the money?

1347
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:33,575
I don't know.

1348
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:37,452
All right,
tell me what you do know.

1349
01:21:38,329 --> 01:21:40,168
Well, your girl
found out where the CIA

1350
01:21:40,169 --> 01:21:42,489
was stashing the money
right about when I did.

1351
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:43,889
And when I told her

1352
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:47,169
that she and I could get away with the
money by setting you and Stigman up,

1353
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:48,295
she didn't even blink.

1354
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:50,088
Don't lie to me.

1355
01:21:50,089 --> 01:21:52,252
Was she that unhappy, Bobby?

1356
01:21:57,530 --> 01:22:00,296
Where is the money?
Don't lie to me.

1357
01:22:00,491 --> 01:22:03,222
You think I'd keep it here with
you and Stigman still alive?

1358
01:22:03,411 --> 01:22:04,855
Come on, Bobby.

1359
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:07,413
You gave it to her, didn't you?

1360
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:11,411
Didn't you?

1361
01:22:11,931 --> 01:22:14,013
Commander.
Back up.

1362
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:19,542
- Go, go, go, go!
- On your six!

1363
01:22:19,732 --> 01:22:21,143
Move, move, move!

1364
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:29,458
<i>All personnel evacuate
the building.</i>

1365
01:22:29,732 --> 01:22:32,815
<i>All personnel
evacuate the building.</i>

1366
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:37,651
Take the back, in that alley!

1367
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,092
Go to the front!
Let's go!

1368
01:22:40,612 --> 01:22:41,691
Hey!

1369
01:22:41,692 --> 01:22:43,342
This way! Move!

1370
01:22:43,852 --> 01:22:45,456
Come on,
come on! Find him!

1371
01:23:30,454 --> 01:23:31,501
Clear!

1372
01:23:32,214 --> 01:23:33,215
Clear!

1373
01:24:03,135 --> 01:24:04,296
You Okay?

1374
01:24:04,455 --> 01:24:05,946
Come on, let's go.

1375
01:24:30,977 --> 01:24:32,945
You okay, sir?
Yeah, I'm fine.

1376
01:24:44,738 --> 01:24:46,661
Work off the standpipe!

1377
01:24:48,178 --> 01:24:50,658
This is really good barbecue.

1378
01:24:51,457 --> 01:24:53,904
You don't want to
regret not tryin' it.

1379
01:24:54,778 --> 01:24:57,622
Why don't you stop wasting
my time and just kill me?

1380
01:24:58,058 --> 01:25:00,459
Even if Bobby was
coming with the money,

1381
01:25:00,578 --> 01:25:02,546
you'd still kill us both.

1382
01:25:07,059 --> 01:25:08,264
But he's not coming.

1383
01:25:08,778 --> 01:25:10,746
He'll be here.
No.

1384
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:12,860
He won't.

1385
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:15,906
You think he's just
gonna let you die?

1386
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:20,787
You think it was a coincidence the Navy
came looking for Bobby at my house?

1387
01:25:21,939 --> 01:25:25,705
If I couldn't have Bobby, at least
I'd have half of 43 million.

1388
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:31,186
You set up Bobby Beans.

1389
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:33,668
I wouldn't be
coming for you either.

1390
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,300
Where's the money?

1391
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,588
Come on. I don't know.

1392
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,310
Gone, outta the country.

1393
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,940
It's certainly not
on a Navy base, Papi.

1394
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,989
Where does that leave you?

1395
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,947
Exactly where I deserve to be.

1396
01:25:55,341 --> 01:25:56,786
<i>- Yeah.
- Bobby.</i>

1397
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,151
You're late.

1398
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:01,747
I got the money.

1399
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:03,630
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

1400
01:26:03,781 --> 01:26:04,828
No, I got it.

1401
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:06,984
<i>Believe me, I got it.
I'll bring it to you.</i>

1402
01:26:07,981 --> 01:26:09,551
<i>Where are you?</i>

1403
01:26:10,141 --> 01:26:11,473
Hi, Bobby.

1404
01:26:11,702 --> 01:26:12,908
Debbie?

1405
01:26:15,701 --> 01:26:16,782
Can he hear us?

1406
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:19,110
Just hang up the phone and run.

1407
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:20,627
<i>Okay, listen to me.</i>

1408
01:26:20,782 --> 01:26:23,626
<i>Tell him I got the money.</i>

1409
01:26:23,822 --> 01:26:25,153
Hang up the phone.

1410
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:30,182
<i>It's not your fault.
Just...</i>

1411
01:26:30,183 --> 01:26:31,183
<i>Debbie.</i>

1412
01:26:31,462 --> 01:26:34,306
Tell him I have
the money. Okay?

1413
01:26:34,502 --> 01:26:37,346
<i>And I know you know
where the money is.</i>

1414
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:39,944
Just tell him I have it.

1415
01:26:41,303 --> 01:26:44,068
<i>Debbie, listen to me.</i>

1416
01:26:44,383 --> 01:26:45,714
I'm sorry.

1417
01:26:47,782 --> 01:26:49,592
I really meant to love you.

1418
01:26:49,743 --> 01:26:51,029
<i>Debbie.</i>

1419
01:26:54,303 --> 01:26:57,193
<i>Where are you?
Debbie, where are you?</i>

1420
01:26:59,984 --> 01:27:01,986
<i>Where are you? Debbie?</i>

1421
01:27:02,304 --> 01:27:03,510
<i>Hello?</i>

1422
01:27:03,943 --> 01:27:04,990
<i>Hello?</i>

1423
01:27:12,344 --> 01:27:13,425
Hello?

1424
01:27:15,624 --> 01:27:18,390
Hello?
Debbie? Uh...

1425
01:27:22,744 --> 01:27:25,065
Wait a minute, I got the money.

1426
01:27:41,065 --> 01:27:42,784
What'd they say?
What'd the Admiral say?

1427
01:27:42,785 --> 01:27:45,704
What'd the Admiral say? Admiral
washed his hands of the whole thing.

1428
01:27:45,705 --> 01:27:47,025
Navy turned their back.

1429
01:27:47,026 --> 01:27:48,266
Where's the money?

1430
01:27:49,786 --> 01:27:52,265
There was no money, Stig.

1431
01:27:52,266 --> 01:27:54,064
What?
There was no money.

1432
01:27:54,065 --> 01:27:55,424
'Course there is.
I gave Quince the money.

1433
01:27:55,425 --> 01:27:58,111
Right, and Quince gave it
to Deb, and Deb is dead.

1434
01:28:00,506 --> 01:28:01,792
Papi killed her.

1435
01:28:05,826 --> 01:28:07,426
Fuck him.

1436
01:28:07,427 --> 01:28:09,066
Let's go down to Mexico.

1437
01:28:09,067 --> 01:28:11,827
We'll lure 'em all down, then take
every one of 'em out. Kill 'em all.

1438
01:28:12,226 --> 01:28:13,387
And then what?

1439
01:28:14,426 --> 01:28:15,946
Well, at least Quince
and Papi'd be dead.

1440
01:28:15,947 --> 01:28:17,266
And then what?

1441
01:28:17,267 --> 01:28:18,586
Oh, you just wanna
let 'em skate?

1442
01:28:18,587 --> 01:28:19,626
You don't get it, do ya, Stig?

1443
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,186
I mean, God bless you, you still
think there's some kinda code.

1444
01:28:22,187 --> 01:28:23,786
There is no code.

1445
01:28:23,787 --> 01:28:26,826
You followed every order the Navy gave
you, they kicked you in the teeth.

1446
01:28:26,827 --> 01:28:28,146
There is no code, Stig.

1447
01:28:28,147 --> 01:28:30,986
No one fights for the Navy, okay?
It's not about the Navy.

1448
01:28:30,987 --> 01:28:33,035
You fight for the guy that's
fighting next to you.

1449
01:28:33,347 --> 01:28:36,147
That doesn't mean anything to you?

1450
01:28:36,148 --> 01:28:37,912
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1451
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:42,587
And just so you know,
my code saved your life.

1452
01:28:42,588 --> 01:28:44,306
There's three inches between
your heart and your shoulder.

1453
01:28:44,307 --> 01:28:46,310
My bullet goes three inches
left, you'd be dead.

1454
01:28:46,428 --> 01:28:47,507
And I wouldn't be here.

1455
01:28:47,508 --> 01:28:49,988
'Cause Quince only decided to
kill me because I let you live.

1456
01:28:50,228 --> 01:28:52,867
What, you think I missed, huh?

1457
01:28:52,868 --> 01:28:55,076
Is that what you think?
You think I missed?

1458
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:57,598
When have you
ever seen me miss?

1459
01:29:00,108 --> 01:29:02,429
You stay here.
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1460
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,758
Our deal still stand?

1461
01:31:09,475 --> 01:31:11,716
I give you the money,
I walk away clean?

1462
01:31:23,715 --> 01:31:26,674
<i>Hola. Looks like you
had a banner morning.</i>

1463
01:31:26,675 --> 01:31:28,280
You better have my money.

1464
01:31:28,596 --> 01:31:29,960
Right here.
Every penny.

1465
01:31:30,675 --> 01:31:31,834
Where's Bobby?

1466
01:31:31,835 --> 01:31:33,994
We had a philosophical
fallin' out.

1467
01:31:33,995 --> 01:31:35,565
Open your trunk.

1468
01:31:35,675 --> 01:31:38,635
I just want your word that you and your
boys, Ferret Nose Julio, all of 'em,

1469
01:31:38,636 --> 01:31:40,076
you'll help me
kill Commander Quince.

1470
01:31:40,396 --> 01:31:41,761
Who's Commander Quince?

1471
01:31:43,676 --> 01:31:44,757
That's him.

1472
01:31:52,516 --> 01:31:55,035
Mr. Stigman, you
promised me $43 million

1473
01:31:55,036 --> 01:31:56,715
for killin' everyone
on this ranch.

1474
01:31:56,716 --> 01:31:57,718
Got the money right here, sir.

1475
01:31:57,837 --> 01:31:59,916
Thing is, I promised Papi
the $43 million, too,

1476
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:01,676
so I'm afraid you two are
gonna have to duke it out.

1477
01:32:01,677 --> 01:32:04,275
Maybe he and I'll just kill you
instead and split the money.

1478
01:32:04,276 --> 01:32:05,323
What do you say, Papi?

1479
01:32:06,036 --> 01:32:08,316
50% of 40 million?

1480
01:32:08,317 --> 01:32:10,081
Better than 100% dead, right?

1481
01:32:10,197 --> 01:32:13,007
He'll double-cross you. Minute your
back is turned, bullet in the head.

1482
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:16,609
50-50.

1483
01:32:16,758 --> 01:32:18,836
The guy up on the roof
says 60-40.

1484
01:32:18,837 --> 01:32:20,839
He ain't got a trustworthy
bone in his body.

1485
01:32:20,957 --> 01:32:22,561
I came back, didn't I?

1486
01:32:53,278 --> 01:32:54,963
Fuckin' CIA.

1487
01:32:56,559 --> 01:32:58,482
Red rover, red rover.

1488
01:32:58,799 --> 01:33:03,598
Whoever's got my 43.125 million
better come the fuck on out.

1489
01:33:03,599 --> 01:33:05,170
You offer him the money, too?

1490
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,439
I didn't call him.

1491
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,851
It's in the trunk!

1492
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,484
Why the fuck did
you tell him that?

1493
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:12,239
Thank you, Commander.

1494
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:15,479
Mr. Stigman, come on out
and open the trunk.

1495
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,050
Nice and slow, now.

1496
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,481
Well, what do we got here?

1497
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,329
Sounds like a Mexican wedding.

1498
01:33:54,522 --> 01:33:56,524
Is that my '64 Impala?

1499
01:33:57,162 --> 01:33:58,447
That's correct.

1500
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:00,727
I told you.

1501
01:34:01,441 --> 01:34:03,321
I know a guy.

1502
01:34:03,322 --> 01:34:04,369
Now,

1503
01:34:04,522 --> 01:34:06,889
who wants to see $43 million?

1504
01:34:10,442 --> 01:34:12,889
For a minute there, I thought
you had me chasing my tail.

1505
01:34:14,962 --> 01:34:16,123
You want to count it?

1506
01:34:16,562 --> 01:34:18,721
If you're shortin' me,
I know where to find you.

1507
01:34:18,722 --> 01:34:20,001
So we're good?

1508
01:34:20,002 --> 01:34:21,241
Did I not give you my word?

1509
01:34:21,242 --> 01:34:22,244
That's right.

1510
01:34:22,363 --> 01:34:24,252
Then don't treat me
like an asshole.

1511
01:34:24,403 --> 01:34:25,609
I'll try my best.

1512
01:34:28,843 --> 01:34:31,882
You and Mr. Stigman
are free to go.

1513
01:34:31,883 --> 01:34:33,002
Yes, sir.

1514
01:34:33,003 --> 01:34:34,682
I trust you can
find your own way home?

1515
01:34:34,683 --> 01:34:35,722
That's right.

1516
01:34:35,723 --> 01:34:37,162
What're you doing, Bobby?
Let's go.

1517
01:34:37,163 --> 01:34:38,802
I'm not gonna let him
get away with the money.

1518
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:40,202
Let's go.
I hate these daggone teeth.

1519
01:34:40,203 --> 01:34:41,363
They're not just
gonna let us go.

1520
01:34:41,364 --> 01:34:43,163
I got a plan.
Hey, I got my M-16.

1521
01:34:43,164 --> 01:34:45,603
I got my grenade launcher, I got my M-4.
Let's do this shit.

1522
01:34:45,604 --> 01:34:47,923
I got a plan. I'm capable
of coming up with a plan.

1523
01:34:47,924 --> 01:34:49,202
Well, it better be
a goddamn good one.

1524
01:34:49,203 --> 01:34:50,362
It's a good plan.

1525
01:34:50,363 --> 01:34:51,570
Make it rain.

1526
01:35:23,845 --> 01:35:25,964
That was your plan?
To blow up $43 million?

1527
01:35:25,965 --> 01:35:28,444
Yeah, that's why it's a brilliant plan.
Nobody expected it.

1528
01:35:30,006 --> 01:35:31,007
Go.

1529
01:36:03,447 --> 01:36:04,972
Come on, move it!

1530
01:36:07,487 --> 01:36:08,774
Dumb assholes!
Move it!

1531
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,529
You comin'?

1532
01:36:31,328 --> 01:36:32,853
Go ahead, I'll be
right behind you.

1533
01:36:32,968 --> 01:36:34,007
Don't miss.

1534
01:36:34,008 --> 01:36:35,339
I never miss!

1535
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:43,016
Told ya.

1536
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:14,851
Stig! Stig!

1537
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:22,529
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

1538
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:23,531
Playtime's over.

1539
01:37:25,091 --> 01:37:26,855
No more fucking around.

1540
01:37:26,971 --> 01:37:28,097
Now,

1541
01:37:28,211 --> 01:37:29,940
drop your weapon.

1542
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:32,410
Tell Mr. Stigman
to do the same.

1543
01:37:32,411 --> 01:37:33,572
You tell him.

1544
01:37:34,931 --> 01:37:36,930
It's real simple.

1545
01:37:36,931 --> 01:37:39,457
We can all make a deal
or we can all die.

1546
01:37:39,571 --> 01:37:41,130
I'm not making any deals.

1547
01:37:41,131 --> 01:37:42,930
Talk to your man, Bobby.

1548
01:37:42,931 --> 01:37:44,371
Be the smart one.

1549
01:37:44,372 --> 01:37:47,251
You think Tres Cruces
is the only stash we got?

1550
01:37:47,252 --> 01:37:50,850
We got 20 more.
We got money everywhere.

1551
01:37:50,851 --> 01:37:52,530
You're not gonna
change a damn thing.

1552
01:37:52,531 --> 01:37:53,532
Stig?

1553
01:37:53,852 --> 01:37:55,013
Yeah?

1554
01:37:56,772 --> 01:37:57,773
You're my people, right?

1555
01:37:59,572 --> 01:38:00,573
That's correct.

1556
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:15,494
You good?

1557
01:38:16,413 --> 01:38:17,744
Never better.

1558
01:38:18,173 --> 01:38:19,972
We're not people, though.

1559
01:38:19,973 --> 01:38:21,259
This makes us family.

1560
01:38:22,053 --> 01:38:23,465
All right, brother.

1561
01:38:24,213 --> 01:38:25,412
<i>Hey, seÃ±or Einstein,</i>

1562
01:38:25,413 --> 01:38:27,852
you're looking kind of fucked
up sittin' there, man.

1563
01:38:27,853 --> 01:38:28,854
You all right?

1564
01:38:32,894 --> 01:38:34,896
Mow my lawn.

1565
01:38:47,334 --> 01:38:48,573
Well, you know
what was so cool?

1566
01:38:48,574 --> 01:38:50,533
You rolling in
on that '64 Impala.

1567
01:38:50,534 --> 01:38:52,134
I mean, you looked badass, man.

1568
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:53,374
Yeah, that's right.

1569
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:55,614
Listen, one more thing,
one more thing.

1570
01:38:55,615 --> 01:38:56,696
What?

1571
01:38:56,815 --> 01:38:58,054
Give me your gun.

1572
01:38:58,694 --> 01:39:00,093
Give me your gun.

1573
01:39:00,094 --> 01:39:01,174
You're not serious.

1574
01:39:01,175 --> 01:39:02,176
Yes, I am.

1575
01:39:02,535 --> 01:39:03,536
Thank you.

1576
01:39:03,655 --> 01:39:05,734
You're really gonna do this after
everything we've been through?

1577
01:39:05,735 --> 01:39:07,694
Arm or leg?

1578
01:39:07,695 --> 01:39:09,294
This is not gonna
make you feel better.

1579
01:39:09,295 --> 01:39:12,335
I'm thinking leg. Because leg, there's
more flesh, there's not as much bone.

1580
01:39:12,336 --> 01:39:13,615
The arm will...

1581
01:39:13,616 --> 01:39:15,174
You know what you are?
You are a petty...

1582
01:39:15,175 --> 01:39:17,701
Fucking son of a bitch!

1583
01:39:17,815 --> 01:39:19,734
Hurts, doesn't it? You
know you coulda killed me?

1584
01:39:19,735 --> 01:39:21,735
Is that right? Three
more inches to the left.

1585
01:39:21,736 --> 01:39:22,815
Don't even say it, man.

1586
01:39:22,816 --> 01:39:24,295
You wouldn't be winking
at waitresses anymore.

1587
01:39:24,296 --> 01:39:26,335
I'd still wink, I just wouldn't
be able to do anything about it.

1588
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,535
You know me, I don't miss.

1589
01:39:27,536 --> 01:39:30,216
I never miss. When's the
last time you saw me miss?

1590
01:39:30,217 --> 01:39:32,867
You gonna carry my ass
all the way the fuck home.

1591
01:39:32,976 --> 01:39:34,899
Oh, shit, man.
This burns.

1592
01:39:35,056 --> 01:39:36,387
That's correct.

1593
01:39:37,616 --> 01:39:40,456
You know, I shot you when
I didn't know who you were.

1594
01:39:40,457 --> 01:39:41,936
Before we were family.

1595
01:39:41,937 --> 01:39:43,016
There's a difference.

1596
01:39:43,017 --> 01:39:45,384
But we're family now. I shot
you because I know who you are.

1597
01:39:45,497 --> 01:39:46,703
That ain't right.

1598
01:40:04,817 --> 01:40:06,421
They definitely got the look.

1599
01:40:06,577 --> 01:40:10,378
Assholes and windshield sunglasses,
practically CIA uniform.

1600
01:40:11,018 --> 01:40:12,383
Can I get you boys
anything else?

1601
01:40:13,578 --> 01:40:14,704
Are your doughnuts any good?

1602
01:40:15,738 --> 01:40:18,185
Tell you the truth,
they're pretty lousy.

1603
01:40:18,339 --> 01:40:20,500
Can't tell you how happy
we are to hear that.

1604
01:40:22,538 --> 01:40:23,744
You take care.

1605
01:40:23,938 --> 01:40:25,097
I saw that.

1606
01:40:25,098 --> 01:40:26,577
Saw what?
You winked.

1607
01:40:26,578 --> 01:40:28,149
That's a twitch.
Yeah, right.

1608
01:40:33,299 --> 01:40:35,218
You know, for a guy who
just blew up $43 million,

1609
01:40:35,219 --> 01:40:37,337
all of a sudden, you are
a very generous tipper.

1610
01:40:37,338 --> 01:40:39,626
Who said I blew up $43 million?

1611
01:40:41,459 --> 01:40:42,538
What are you sayin'?

1612
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:43,858
I'm not sayin' anything.
What are you hearing?

1613
01:40:43,859 --> 01:40:45,858
I'm hearin' somethin'.
You're sayin' somethin'.

1614
01:40:45,859 --> 01:40:47,899
Well, if you're hearin' it, it's
only because you're hearin' it,

1615
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:50,419
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

1616
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,910
How much did you keep?

1617
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,105
Two million?

1618
01:40:55,099 --> 01:40:56,779
That's like one each.

1619
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:58,099
So now you get half?

1620
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:00,228
Well, I shot half the guys. So?

1621
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,831
Two million?

1622
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:13,000
