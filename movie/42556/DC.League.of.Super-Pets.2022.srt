1
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:27,194
我们必须快点。
We must hurry.

2
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:30,263
地球不会再存活多久了。
The planet won't survive much longer.

3
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:32,097
你确定吗?
Are you sure about this?

4
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,932
恐怕这是唯一的办法了。
I'm afraid it's the only way.

5
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,344
氪星就要死了。
Krypton is about to die.

6
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:51,449
但你，亲爱的儿子，会活下去的。
But you, dear son, will live on.

7
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,457
Krypto,不!
Krypto, no!

8
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,371
哦!Krypto !
Oh! Krypto!

9
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,843
不。
No.

10
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,280
我们的孩子需要一个朋友。
Our boy will need a friend.

11
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,979
照看好我们的儿子。
Watch over our son.

12
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:48,585
好了，醒醒，伙计。这是walk-o整。
All right, wake up, buddy. It is walk-o'clock.

13
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,223
也许我应该让他睡一觉?
Maybe I should let him sleep?

14
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:55,658
好吧，我让他睡了。
Okay, I let him sleep.

15
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,629
好吧。
All right.

16
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:13,339
这对我们俩来说都不愉快。
This is unpleasant for both of us.

17
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:15,508
不。不,不。不,不。
No. No, no. No, no.

18
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,046
嗯。
Hmm.

19
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,620
五个……五分钟。
Five more... Five more minutes.

20
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,356
我起来。
And I'm up.

21
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,125
好的,Krypto。
Okay, Krypto.

22
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:36,893
我们去散步。
We'll go for a walk.

23
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:48,102
哇!

Mxyzptlk先生终于被打败了。
Mister Mxyzptlk has finally been defeated.

46
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:17,348
原来，他只需要倒着念他的名字。
Turns out, he just needed to say his name backwards.

47
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,250
我是露易丝·莱恩，来自大都会。
From Metropolis, I'm Lois Lane.

48
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:20,283
嘿,露易丝。
Hey, Lois.

49
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:26,756
我知道你喜欢这个，所以我从巴黎给你买了一个。
I know you like these, so I got you one from actual Paris.

50
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:29,693
我不知道我为什么那样说。
I don't know why I said it like that.

51
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,795
我从43街给你买了一个。
And I got you one of these from 43rd Street.

52
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,564
离我的路足足有三个街区远。
Which is, like, a full three blocks out of my way.

53
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:36,765
在高峰时间吗?
During rush hour?

54
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,667
这就像我要飞到火星一样。
Wow, that's like me flying to Mars.

55
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,436
什么?你能飞吗?
What? You can fly?

56
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,804
我一直以为斗篷只是个可爱的装饰品。
I always thought the cape was just a cute accessory.

57
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:46,073
哦!所以你觉得我很可爱。
Oh! So you think I'm cute.

58
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:47,809
我说斗篷很可爱。
I said the cape was cute.

59
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,743
你觉得我很可爱。
You think I'm cute.

60
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,447
我们现在在舔脸吗?
Are we lickin' faces right now?

61
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,520
因为如果我们要舔脸，我就得加入…
Because if we're lickin' faces, I gotta get in on...

62
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,685
哦，这是什么?
Oh, what do I have here?

63
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,188
捏的布鲁斯!
Squeezy Bruce!

64
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,289
获取!
Fetch!

65
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,157
小狗，快起来!
Pup, up and away!

66
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,827
好了，我们说到哪了?
Okay, where were we?

67
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,363
捏的布鲁斯检索。
Squeezy Bruce retrieved.

68
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,063
嘿，那些家伙看起来很有趣。
Hey, those guys look fun.

69
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:14,377
你去和他们玩怎么样?
How about you go play with them?

70
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:30,712
所以我在吃自己的呕吐物，然后…所以，我在吃我自己的…所以我……我…我知道你躲进了你的蝙蝠洞，但没人能躲过正义的长鼻子。
So I'm eating my own vomit, and then the... So, I'm eating my own... So I'm... I'm... I see you've retreated to your Batcave, but nobody can hide from the long snoot of justice.

71
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,651
嗯。
Hmm.

72
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:39,453
然后我说"如果你不想让我在地毯上蹭屁股，那就去铺硬木地板"
And then I says, "If you don't want me rubbing my butt in the carpet, get hardwood floors."

73
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:42,299
Squeezy Bruce被找回来了。
Squeezy Bruce has been retrieved.

74
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:44,090
等等，你知道这是谁吗?
Wait, do you know who this is?

75
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,327
是超级狗氪星。
It's Krypto the Super dog.

76
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,562
好的。你可以拿走我的爪印。
Okay. You can have my pawtograph.

77
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:57,136
听着，恐怕我只能签一个，否则我要签一整天了。
Listen, I'm afraid I gotta keep it to just one, or I'll be signing all day.

78
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,673
失陪了，我得把这个还给我儿子。
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get this back to my boy.

79
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:03,107
-他不想要。-不好意思，什么?
- He doesn't want it. - I'm sorry, what?

80
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,709
Outside-Underpants先生。
Mr. Outside-Underpants.

81
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,177
他不想要玩具。
He doesn't want the toy.

82
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,645
他想摆脱你。
He's trying to get rid of ya.

83
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,781
什么?那太荒唐了。
What? That's ridiculous.

84
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:12,182
超人和我形影不离。
Superman and I are inseparable.

85
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:13,717
我是他的坐骑或死。
I'm his ride or die.

86
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,185
噢,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

87
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,887
这些天你睡在哪里?
Where you, uh, sleeping these days?

88
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,289
我和超人一起睡在床上。
I sleep in bed with Supes.

89
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:23,526
除非露易丝在这里过夜，那我就得搬到我在地板上的特别位置。
Except when Lois stays over, then I have to move to my extra special spot on the floor.

90
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,295
残酷的。
Brutal.

91
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,129
同样的事情也发生在我身上。
Same thing happened to me.

92
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,699
南希有了未婚妻，一切都结束了。
Nancy got a fiancee and it was all over.

93
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:33,134
那是法语“拜拜，狗”的意思。
That's French for "Bye-bye, dog."

94
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,470
是啊，你可没我那么有超能力。
Yeah, well, you don't get Supes like I get Supes.

95
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:44,110
我是说，他当然会约会，但他永远不会爱任何人，除了…我爱你。
I mean, sure, the guy dates, but he will never love anyone except for... I love you.

96
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,170
你还好吗?
Um, are you okay?

97
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,272
我?是的,我……我很好。
Me? Yes, I'm... I'm fine.

98
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:22,778
我没事，我完全... 没事?
I am fine. I'm totally... Fine?

99
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:24,413
好吧，聊得不错。英镑。
All right, good talk. Pound it out.

100
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,660
这听起来可能有点疯狂，但既然我们在一起了，我觉得克里普托被忽略了?
This might sound crazy, but now that we're together, I think Krypto feels left out?

101
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:47,199
是的。我想我算是他唯一的朋友了。
Yeah. I guess I'm, kind of, his only friend.

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,502
这是甜的。
That's sweet.

103
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,737
但如果他也有个新朋友，他可能会更开心。
But maybe he'd be happier if he had a new friend, too.

104
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:02,379
早上好,朋友。
Good morning, friends.

105
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,683
所以它开始。
So it begins.

106
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:09,352
卡尔会像时钟一样，试图和帕蒂调情。
Like clockwork, Carl will try to flirt with Patty.

107
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:10,987
噢!那是新的香水吗?
Ooh! Is that new perfume?

108
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,255
这是猫尿。
It's cat pee.

109
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,823
零博弈。
And have zero game.

110
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:17,659
给这只帅气的狗狗足够的时间…你在干什么，艾斯?
Giving this handsome canine just enough time to... What you doin', Ace?

111
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,227
我要疯了，PB。
I'm bustin' loose, PB.

112
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:20,796
受够了这个笼子。
Sick of this whole cage situation.

113
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,264
哦,我的女神。
Oh, my goddess.

114
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:26,934
这就像神奇女侠用她的屈服手镯逃离了毒博士的秘密藏身处一样。
This is just like when Wonder Woman used her Bracelets of Submission to escape Doctor Poison's secret hideout.

115
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,569
喜欢……这个!
Like... this!

116
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:31,971
好的。不完全是这样。
Okay. Not exactly like this.

117
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,507
要是被救援小姐抓住了怎么办?
What if the rescue lady catches you?

118
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,409
然后把你锁在里屋?
And locks you in the back room?

119
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:38,944
他们只听舒缓的爵士乐。
Where they only listen to smooth jazz.

120
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:42,848
放松,芯片。我让我的姑娘默顿放哨。
Relax, Chip. I got my girl, Merton, running lookout.

121
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:45,751
这些偷窥者什么都不会错过。
These peepers don't miss a thing.

122
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:48,686
如果救援女士来了，你会知道的。
If the rescue lady's coming, you'll know it.

123
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,525
完美的。因为我差点就…不。
Perfect. Because I almost got myself out of the... Nope.

124
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,827
我想救星来了!
I think the rescue lady's coming!

125
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,295
谢谢你,默顿。
Thanks, Merton.

126
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:00,430
这是一个…那是个好机会。
That's a... that's a good catch.

127
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:01,598
我支持你，艾斯。
I'm rooting for you, Ace.

128
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:07,269
但你难道不想被收养感受一个独居中年人的温暖拥抱吗?
But don't you wanna get adopted and feel the warm embrace of a middle-aged person who lives alone?

129
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:09,472
是的。他会成为你最好的新朋友。
Yeah. Who will be your new best friend.

130
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:11,840
你们是我最好的朋友，傻瓜。
You're my best friends, dummies.

131
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,743
你们都跟我去农场。
And you're all coming with me to the farm.

132
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:17,679
我喜欢听他讲农场!
I love when he talks about the farm!

133
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:19,647
农场北部。
The farm upstate.

134
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:24,952
一个未被驯服的天堂，在那里动物们自由奔跑，他们彼此关爱，互相保护。
An untamed paradise where animals run free and they love and protect one another.

135
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,354
生菜长在树上。
And the lettuce grows on trees.

136
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,957
没有避难所阿姨监视我们的一举一动。不。
No shelter lady watching our every move. Nope.

137
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,360
这是一个100%的动物农场。
It's a 100% animal farm.

138
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,962
这听起来一点都不不祥。
That doesn't sound ominous at all.

139
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,529
它是完美的。
It's perfect.

140
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,732
等我把我们都弄出去，我们就去那里。
And when I get us all outta here, well, that's where we're gonna go.

141
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,901
狗是对的。
The dog is right.

142
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,369
他应该寻求自己的自由。
He should seek his freedom.

143
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,971
你看到了吗?露露得到它。
You see that? Lulu gets it.

144
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:51,642
他必须消灭所有阻挡他的人!
And he must destroy all who stand in his way!

145
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:54,010
哇。好吧，那只是个转折。
Wow. Well, that just took a turn.

146
00:11:54,043 --> 00:12:00,583
你可以拿你的傻农场开玩笑，但我有那个装置!
You may kid yourself with your silly farm, but I have the device!

147
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:08,032
因为，不久的将来，当星宿连成一线时，这个装置将带给我终极力量，我将不仅是自由!
For, one day soon, when the stars align, the device will bring me ultimate power and I will be more than free!

148
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:10,458
“将不仅仅是自由!”
"Will be more than free!"

149
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:11,926
完全正确。
Exactly.

150
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,830
露露，不管他们在你身上做了什么实验，都给你少了几基尼的猪。
Lulu, whatever they tested on you in that lab, left you a few guineas short of a pig.

151
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:18,832
那个装置就是一堆垃圾。
That device is just a pile of garbage.

152
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,600
你害怕我的才华。
You fear my brilliance.

153
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:21,802
退到阴影。
Recede into shadows.

154
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:22,969
退到阴影。
Recede into shadows.

155
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,371
保持眼神交流。
Maintain eye contact.

156
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:26,739
退到阴影。
Recede into shadows.

157
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:29,909
好了，孩子，我马上回来给你个惊喜。
All right, boy, I'll be right back with a surprise.

158
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:34,479
我会留在这里，用我的秘密身份摆姿势。
And I will remain here, posing under my secret identity.

159
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:38,083
肯特树皮。
Bark Kent.

160
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:41,719
你最近怎么样，普通的狗狗?
So, what is new with you, fellow normal dog?

161
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,857
前几天我咬了那个联邦快递的人。
Uh, I bit the FedEx guy the other day.

162
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,425
啊,不错。
Ah, fine job.

163
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,660
他为谁工作?
Who was he working for?

164
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,594
佐德?末日军团?
General Zod? The Legion of Doom?

165
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:53,830
联邦快递。
FedEx.

166
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:56,599
当然!前任联盟。
Of course! The federation of exes.

167
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:58,433
不值得信任。
Not to be trusted.

168
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,609
我的主人怎么这么久才来?
What is taking my owner so long?

169
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:11,445
肯特先生，你想再找一只宠物吗?
So, Mr. Kent, you're looking for another pet, huh?

170
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,547
嗯，我的狗是最好的。
Well, my dog's the best.

171
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:16,116
但我已经有女朋友了。
But I've got this girlfriend.

172
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,785
我今晚就向她求婚。
And I'm gonna ask her to marry me tonight.

173
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,587
哦!
Aw!

174
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,422
——恭喜你。——谢谢!
- Congratulations. - Thanks!

175
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:27,993
但他还不知道，我觉得他可能需要一个自己的朋友。
But he doesn't know that yet, and I just think maybe he needs a friend of his own.

176
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:33,049
那我觉得艾斯是个完美的…你觉得豚鼠怎么样?
Well, then I think Ace here would be the perfect... How do you feel about guinea pigs?

177
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,144
打烊后我再来找你们。
I'll come back for all of you guys after closing.

178
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,468
保持强劲。
Stay strong.

179
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:40,537
好了。
There we go.

180
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,050
天啊，好痛。
Oh, man, that hurt.

181
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,619
是的。这也伤害了我。
Yes. And that hurt me as well.

182
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:01,723
因为我和普通的狗狗一样能感觉到疼痛。
Due to the fact that I feel pain as any ordinary canine would.

183
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:09,596
啊哈。总之，我正在越狱，所以你能不能…?
Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm kind of in the middle of a prison break, so could you please...?

184
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,664
越狱吗?
Prison break?

185
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:16,069
给我站住，停止你的非法活动，我从没见过的狗。
Stop right there and cease your unlawful activities, dog I've never met.

186
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,837
你到底在说什么，伙计?
The heck are you talking about, man?

187
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,572
你就是刚才跟在我后面的那条狗。
You the same dog that was literally just behind me.

188
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:23,541
不可能的。那只狗戴眼镜。
Impossible. That dog wore glasses.

189
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:25,744
现在投降吧，我不想伤害你。
Now surrender, I don't want to hurt you.

190
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,512
好吧，你想去那里吗。
Oh, okay, so you wanna take it there.

191
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:28,946
你想扔爪子，那好。
You wanna throw paws, then fine.

192
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:30,781
但我得提醒你，我有八分之一的鲍克瑟血统。
But I should warn you, I'm one-eighth Boxer.

193
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:33,617
和7/8的吉娃娃。
And seven-eighths Chihuahua.

194
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:34,952
吉娃娃犬是恶性。
Chihuahuas are vicious.

195
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:36,620
把这。拿一点这个。
Take that. Take a little bit of this.

196
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,488
敲一下，我就放你出来。
Tap out, and I'll let you out.

197
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:39,489
雷声来了!
Here come the thunder!

198
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:41,191
你会成功的!啊!
You're gonna get it! Ahhh!

199
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,560
哦,男人。我感到一阵疼痛。是啊，我得下跪。
Oh, man. I'm getting a stitch. Yeah, I gotta take a knee.

200
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:47,663
如果我没缝好这针，我就能让你如愿以偿了。
Oh, if I didn't get this stitch, I had you where I wanted you.

201
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:49,998
香蕉!让我……给我一根香蕉!快点!
Banana! Get me... Get me a banana! Hurry up!

202
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:53,634
这是寒冷的,男人。
That's cold, man.

203
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:56,904
哦!你真是一缕阳光啊?
Aw! Aren't you a little ray of sunshine?

204
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,908
什么?
What?

205
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:07,580
哦,Krypto。
Oh, Krypto.

206
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,949
你觉得自己很了不起，是吧，超级狗?
Oh, you think you're so great, don't you, Super dog?

207
00:15:09,982 --> 00:15:11,583
你以为你的便便不臭。
You think your dookie don't stink.

208
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:13,119
我的便便不臭。
My dookie doesn't stink.

209
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,188
等等，等等，暂停。你是认真的吗，现在?
Wait, wait, time out. Are you serious, right now?

210
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:17,723
是的，它闻起来像檀香。
Yep, it actually smells like sandalwood.

211
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:19,891
说实话，这是一种边缘性的芳香疗法。
It's borderline aromatherapy, if I'm being honest.

212
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:23,262
哇!哇!
Whoa! Whoa!

213
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:24,729
你不正常，伙计。
You ain't normal, man.

214
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:26,663
是啊，至少我有主人了。
Yeah, well, at least I have an owner.

215
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:29,599
你不能拥有我。我是一只野生动物。
You can't own me. I'm a wild animal.

216
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:31,835
完全正确。那我们把你放回笼子里吧。
Exactly. So, let's get you back in the cage.

217
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:33,770
超人可能想我了。
Supes is probably missing me.

218
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:35,004
想?
Missing?

219
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:40,743
那家伙把你绑在停车标志上然后去收容所给你买了个新朋友好让你给他点空间。
The dude tied you up to the stop sign and went into that shelter to buy you a new friend so that you'd give him some space.

220
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:42,711
明白了。
Gotcha.

221
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,280
超人永远不会那样做。
Superman would never do that.

222
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:46,748
好吧，它现在真的正在发生。
Well, it's literally happening right now.

223
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:49,517
我很高兴那个新朋友不是我。
I'm just glad that that new friend ain't me.

224
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:50,884
放松,卡尔。
Easy, Carl.

225
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,638
别装得好像你不认识我似的。
Stop acting like you don't know me.

226
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,291
不错的尝试,胡迪尼。
Nice try, Houdini.

227
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:00,893
你说过你会回来找我们的
Well, you did say you'd come back for us.

228
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,966
哦,采用时间。
Ooh, adoption time.

229
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,168
我们总有一个人可以依偎在一起。
One of us is gonna get someone to snuggle with.

230
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,969
是啊，别抱太大希望。
Yeah, don't get your hopes up.

231
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,506
他们总是挑…给你，宝贝。
They always pick the... Here you go, baby.

232
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,607
哇!第一天。
Wow! First day.

233
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,844
成为一个救援动物是容易和有趣的!
Being a rescue animal is easy and fun!

234
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:27,617
嘿。下次你一定会抓到他们的。
Hey. You'll get 'em next time.

235
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:30,653
是的。下一个时间。
Yeah. Next time.

236
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:38,961
真不敢相信那个收容所的混蛋说我不正常。
I can't believe that shelter punk said I wasn't normal.

237
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,962
我是一只完全正常的狗。
I'm a totally normal dog.

238
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:47,835
超人也不可能在里面帮我找朋友。
And no way Superman was in there looking for a friend for me.

239
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:49,603
我不需要朋友
♪ I don't need a friend ♪

240
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,172
♬超人是我的朋友
♪ Supes is my friend ♪

241
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:54,108
♬我唯一的朋友是超人
♪ My only friend is Superman ♪

242
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:57,943
嗯。
Hmm.

243
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,218
那是什么?
What's that?

244
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,062
有人把流星拖向城市?
Someone is dragging a meteor toward the city?

245
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:24,000
卢梭。
Luthor.

246
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,773
你好,漂亮。
Hello, gorgeous.

247
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:36,945
我多么渴望你能进入我的太阳系啊。
Oh, how I have longed for you to enter my solar system.

248
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:38,313
这是一个摇滚。
It's a rock.

249
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:41,916
那块石头，梅西，百分之百是橙色氪石。
That rock, Mercy, is 100% orange kryptonite.

250
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,252
酷。另一个引火上身。
Cool. Another kryptonite scheme.

251
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:45,852
不，这次不一样!
No, this is different!

252
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:51,301
绿色氪石会夺走超人的能力，而橙色氪石会给我超能力。
Green kryptonite takes away Superman's powers, but orange kryptonite Will give me superpowers.

253
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:58,964
比如，隐身，激光眼，或者用力扔扑克牌。
You know, like, uh, invisibility or, uh, laser-eyes, or throwing playing cards really hard.

254
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:03,668
我终于要比那个愚蠢的…你不是在说我吧?
I'm finally gonna be stronger than that stupid... You're not talking about me, are you?

255
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,004
我想他也在说我。
Yeah, I think he was talking about me, too.

256
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,073
这是尴尬的。
That's awkward.

257
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:09,374
超人。
Superman.

258
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:13,411
我还以为你和你那杂种会早点来呢。
I'd expected you and that mutt of yours much sooner.

259
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:15,879
我需要你放开那颗流星，莱科斯。
I'm gonna need you to let go of that meteor, Lex.

260
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:16,980
很乐意。
Gladly.

261
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,389
Krypto,取回!
Krypto, fetch!

262
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,802
那只狗是个英雄!
That dog's a hero!

263
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,037
Krypto !
Krypto!

264
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,737
好狗。
Good dog.

265
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,407
让我们把这东西放回它该去的地方。
Let's put this thing back in space where it belongs.

266
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:49,243
女士。婴儿。
Ma'am. Baby.

267
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,784
让我们看看你现在能不能抓住它。
Let's see if you can catch it now.

268
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,056
啊!
Ah!

269
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:12,062
你忘了一件事，莱克斯。
You forgot one thing, Lex.

270
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:14,731
不像你，我有朋友。
Unlike you, I have friends.

271
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:18,834
谢谢你把你那愚蠢的邪恶总部建在河边。
Thanks for building your stupid evil headquarters on the river.

272
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,936
对水工来说非常方便。
Very convenient for the water guy.

273
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:23,805
我潜水侠!
I'm Aquaman!

274
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,141
哦,太棒了。这些jabronies。
Oh, great. These jabronies.

275
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,410
有人给技术支持打电话了吗?
Uh, did somebody call tech support?

276
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,978
你试过关机再开机吗?
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

277
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,318
谢谢你,朋友。
Thanks, buddy.

278
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,886
好友吗?不，这些人最多是工作上的朋友。
Buddy? No, these people are work friends at best.

279
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,323
请系好安全带。
Please fasten your safety belts.

280
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,890
他们是看不见的。
They are invisible.

281
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,726
没错，这些东西都不是隐形的。
Yeah, none of this stuff is invisible.

282
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,162
它真的更透明了。
It's really more transparent.

283
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:56,368
嗯?
Hmm?

284
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:57,935
我喜欢你的激光装置。
I like your laser thing.

285
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,404
但是绿色看起来更好。
But it looks better in green.

286
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,074
是的。
Yeah.

287
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:05,875
LexCorp公司的权力诉讼开始了。
LexCorp power suit engaged.

288
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,877
温暖的激活。
Seat warmer activated.

289
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,047
我花过的最好的十亿美元。
Best billion I ever spent.

290
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:22,257
我只需要一小块。
All I need is one little piece.

291
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,298
上帝保佑你的小心脏。
Aw, bless your little heart.

292
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:33,092
你以为你会抢先一步吗?
Did you think you were gonna get to it first?

293
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,506
谢谢你！
Thank you.

294
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,425
我成为了我一直想成为的人。
I am what I was always meant to become.

295
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:07,530
嗯?这是什么?
Huh? What is this?

296
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:10,267
但我应该有超能力的!
But I'm supposed to have superpowers!

297
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,868
他们高估了。
They're overrated.

298
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,176
好男孩,Krypto。
Good boy, Krypto.

299
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:25,055
谁是好孩子?谁是好孩子?
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

300
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,314
你是我的超级狗狗吗?是吗?
Are you my super dog go? Are you?

301
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:29,549
哦!的舌头。
Oh! In the tongue.

302
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,585
谁是好孩子?谁是好孩子?
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?

303
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:33,553
我想念我的父母。
I miss my parents.

304
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:35,787
是谁把氪星石扔回太空的?
Who threw that kryptonite back into space?

305
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:00,343
你好,漂亮。
Hello, gorgeous.

306
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:03,979
我是多么渴望你能进入我的太阳系啊。
Oh, how I've longed for you to enter my solar system.

307
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,398
你赢了这一轮，生菜。
You win this round, lettuce.

308
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:33,305
伙计们，怎么了?
Guys, what's going on?

309
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:36,308
没什么,PB。
Nothing, PB.

310
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:39,445
只是你们说疯狂的计划结果却疯狂的好。
Just the plan that you all called crazy turns out to be crazy good.

311
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:44,981
我回到实验室的时候，有个人类。
You see, when I was back in the lab, there was this human.

312
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:48,985
他邪恶，虐待狂，性感。
He was evil, sadistic, hot.

313
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,156
我们是两位寻找终极力量的科学家。
And together we were two scientists searching for ultimate power.

314
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,525
当然，在这个过程中也有失误。
Of course, there were missteps along the way.

315
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,361
红色氪石让我的头发都掉光了。
The red kryptonite made my hair fall out.

316
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:00,429
幸运的是，我的骨骼结构可以把它拉下来。
Luckily, I had the bone structure to pull it off.

317
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,232
紫色给我带来了令人不安的生动的梦。
Purple gave me uncomfortably vivid dreams.

318
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:09,070
但橙色…我们知道橘子会不一样。
But the orange... we knew the orange would be different.

319
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:10,938
我们有一个计划。
And we had a plan.

320
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:13,141
直到超级狗克瑞普来毁了它。
Until Krypto the Super dog had to come and ruin it.

321
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:17,402
愚蠢的名字。以他的星球命名。哦,真正的创新。
Stupid name. Named after his planet. Oh, real creative.

322
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,382
谢谢,Krypto !
Thanks, Krypto!

323
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:22,624
我要回家了，儿子!
I'm coming home, son!

324
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:24,950
嗯?你到底在干什么?
Huh? What the heck are you doing?

325
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:27,453
我要把你从这个可怕的动物实验室里解救出来。
I'm freeing you from this horrible animal testing lab.

326
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:30,189
不!这是我的家!
No! This is my home!

327
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:32,224
现在这就是你的新家。
And now this is your new home.

328
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:34,001
——欢迎你。-你在说什么?
- You're welcome. - What are you talking about?

329
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,294
哦，你是最可爱的!
Oh, you're the sweetest!

330
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,496
放掉我,姑娘!
Unhand me, wench!

331
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:49,105
所以我在这个令人不安的小屋里等待时机，准备着。
So I bided my time in this disturbing hovel, preparing.

332
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:52,709
因为我发现了连莱科斯都做不到的事。
Because I'd figured out something that even Lex couldn't.

333
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:55,511
橙色氪石对人不起作用。
Orange kryptonite doesn't work on people.

334
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:59,381
它只对宠物有效。
It only works on pets.

335
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:13,360
露露，你还好吗?
Uh, Lulu, are you okay?

336
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:16,096
我很好，猪。
Oh, I'm more than okay, pig.

337
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:19,433
我成为了我一直想成为的人。
I am what I was always meant to become.

338
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:29,374
露露,嘿。什么?带我们一起走，好吗?
Lulu, hey. What? Take us with you, okay?

339
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:34,078
我们收留动物，你知道，我们……我们要团结在一起，对吧?团结。
Us shelter animals, you know, we... we gotta stick together, right? Solidarity.

340
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:36,046
哦，艾斯，对不起。
Oh, Ace, I'm sorry.

341
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,317
我现在真的没有时间照顾宠物!
I don't really have time in my life right now to take care of a pet!

342
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:49,725
露露,等等!
Lulu, wait!

343
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,260
不要把我们留在这里!
Do not leave us here!

344
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:56,331
别担心，我相信总有一天会有人收养你的。
Don't worry, I'm sure someone wonderful will adopt you any day.

345
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:58,066
关于我的什么?
What about me?

346
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,401
哦,胡须。
Oh, Whiskers.

347
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:00,668
当然。我不是怪物。
Of course. I'm not a monster.

348
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,606
想念你的。爱你。玩得开心。
Miss you. Love you. Have fun.

349
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,545
等等,PB。我来救我们出去。
Hold on, PB. I'mma get us out.

350
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,482
我闻到培根!
I smell bacon!

351
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,282
我为什么流口水?
Why is my mouth watering?

352
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,318
这里有太多东西需要整理。
There's so much to unpack here.

353
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,387
伙计们,我小!
Guys, I'm small!

354
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:25,223
刚才发生了什么?
What just happened?

355
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:28,192
不，说真的，刚刚发生了什么?我看不到。
No, seriously, what just happened? I can't see.

356
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,695
橙色氪石也给了我超能力。
The orange kryptonite gave me powers, too.

357
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:33,331
这是我的起源故事。
This is my origin story.

358
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:35,499
我叔叔甚至不用死。
And my uncle didn't even have to die.

359
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:37,267
嗯，那太好了。
Uh, yeah, that's great.

360
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,670
但这对你的老朋友艾斯来说可不太好。
But it ain't lookin' too good for your old pal Ace.

361
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:44,673
正确的。神奇猪，还在想名字，还在想。
Right. Wonder Pig, still working on the name, is on it.

362
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:48,744
哦。
Uh-oh.

363
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:54,282
——王牌,不!——王牌!
- Ace, no! - Ace!

364
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,259
我现在应该死了才对，对吧?
I should be a lot more dead right now, right?

365
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,693
哦,我的天啊。
Oh, my gosh.

366
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,762
橙色氪星石也给了你超能力!
The orange kryptonite gave you powers, too!

367
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:11,430
你是超级强!
You're super strong!

368
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:14,833
你的尾巴现在是火做的。
And your tail is now made of fire.

369
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,701
我很抱歉。我的什么是谁?
I'm sorry. My what is who?

370
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:22,274
我的尾巴!啊，放开我的……哦,我的尾巴…我的尾巴着火了!
My tail! Ah, let go of my... Oh, my tail... My tail on fire!

371
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:23,407
我的尾巴着火了!
I got my tail on fire!

372
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,209
王牌,这很好。看到了吗?
Ace, it's fine. See?

373
00:26:26,277 --> 00:26:27,745
嗯?
Huh?

374
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:29,446
你是无敌的。
You're invulnerable.

375
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,400
我可以把自己缩小到…
And I can shrink myself down to the size of an...

376
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:36,819
啊!
Ah!

377
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:39,221
还在解决问题。我什么都没看见。
Still working out the kinks. I didn't see anything.

378
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:42,824
你去找奇普，我去找默特。
You go get Chip, I'll get Mert.

379
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:54,802
用你的脸，生菜。
In your face, lettuce.

380
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:08,147
哦,太棒了。
Oh, great.

381
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,516
我是唯一一个没有得到超能力的人…
I'm the only one who didn't get any super...

382
00:27:19,624 --> 00:27:23,627
大都市97.2……光滑的爵士乐。
Metropolis 97.2... ...smooth jazz.

383
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,698
-来吧，我们离开这里。——正确的。
- Come on, let's get outta here. - Right.

384
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,133
更新。
Update.

385
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,769
我现在快了，但我还是看不见。
I'm fast now, but I still can't see.

386
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,676
嗯。我们开始吧。
Uh-uh. Here we go.

387
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:49,216
好的。周四晚上看电视。
All right. Thursday night TV night.

388
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,753
该和我兄弟在大都会看我最喜欢的节目了。嗯?
Time for my favorite show with my bro in Metropo. Huh?

389
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:54,654
♬我是超人♬
♪ I am Superman ♪

390
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,789
♬我可以做任何…♪
♪ And I can do any... ♪

391
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:58,391
嗯?什么……?
Huh? What the...?

392
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:01,360
让我来解决这个问题。
Let me just iron that out.

393
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,630
他们应该叫我钢铁侠。不。
They should call me Iron Man. No.

394
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:06,331
看看你，光鲜亮丽。
Well, look at you, all spiffy.

395
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:08,233
在英国烘焙大赛上打扮得很漂亮。
Pretty dressed up for the British Bake Off.

396
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,734
但是你知道吗?它是有意义的。
But you know what? It makes sense.

397
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,687
这是本季的最后一集。
This is the season finale.

398
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:15,606
你有约会?
You have a date?

399
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:19,242
“烘焙之夜”?
On Bake Off night?

400
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:24,414
哦!嘿，小家伙。
Aw! Hey there, little fella.

401
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,957
不。
Nah.

402
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:38,393
嘿,露易丝。哦!
Hey, Lois. Oh!

403
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:47,200
哦。听着,伙计,我…今天是馅饼周。
Oh. Listen, buddy, I... It is pie week.

404
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:49,236
你的选择。她或我。
Your choice. Her or me.

405
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,904
你怎么了?
What's gotten into you?

406
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:53,406
坏狗。
Bad dog.

407
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,375
你刚才叫我什么?
What did you just call me?

408
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:00,290
这太过分了，伙计。我是说，如果你想…我们等我回家再谈。
That is way out of line, fella. I mean, if you want... We'll talk about this when I get home.

409
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,184
我太想你了!
I've missed you so much!

410
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:11,288
你又把"挤压布鲁斯"忘在走廊了。
You left Squeezy Bruce in the hallway again.

411
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:13,691
很好。
Fine.

412
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:16,459
我一个人看着面包皮变脆。
I'll watch the crusts crisp alone.

413
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:18,695
坏老板!
Bad owner!

414
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:23,976
下面也很湿。
It's quite wet right underneath as well.

415
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,567
底部有点湿。
Slightly soggy bottom there.

416
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:27,769
♬因为现在我们有了嫌隙♬
♪ 'Cause baby now we got bad blood ♪

417
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:30,973
♬你知道这曾经是疯狂的爱
♪ You know it used to be mad love ♪

418
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,477
嗯?
Huh?

419
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:44,484
卡尔·艾尔，乔·艾尔的儿子，我是露露，辛纳蒙的女儿，你要跪在我面前。
Kal-El, son of Jor-El, I am Lulu, daughter of Cinnamon, and you will kneel before me.

420
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,590
等一下。
Wait a minute.

421
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,358
你不是收容所的仓鼠吗?
Aren't you the hamster from the shelter?

422
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,761
我是小白鼠，我说跪下!
I am a guinea pig, and I said kneel!

423
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,368
看，看我从旧实验室找到了什么。
Well, lookie-lookie what I got from the old lab.

424
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:09,439
帮助,Krypto……-♪我们有问题♪-♪我们有问题♪
Help, Krypto... - ♪ We got problems ♪ - ♪ We got problems ♪

425
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,374
♬我不认为我们能解决……♪
♪ And I don't think we can solve... ♪

426
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:14,443
我想我们能解决
♪ Think we can solve them ♪

427
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:18,014
你真应该让我更难找到你。
You really should have made it harder to find you.

428
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:20,282
那副眼镜骗不了任何人。
Those glasses aren't fooling anyone.

429
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:21,750
可能会留胡子，但不会戴眼镜。
Moustache maybe, but not glasses.

430
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:22,817
哇!
Whoa!

431
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:27,655
为什么约会之夜总是这样?
Why does this always happen on date night?

432
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:30,000
这里是正义联盟的紧急热线。
You've reached the Justice League emergency line.

433
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:31,692
地球一号，请按1。
For Earth-One, press one.

434
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:33,027
地球二号，请按2。
For Earth-Two, press two.

435
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:36,563
为地球三…天啊，看起来很疼啊。
For Earth-Three... Oh, man, that looked like it hurt.

436
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:37,864
我希望如此。
I hope it did.

437
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:48,774
哇，你还在努力。
Wow, look at you still trying.

438
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,475
勇敢的。
Plucky.

439
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,311
很好,然后。妈妈喜欢大打出手。
Fine, then. Mama likes a good fight.

440
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,687
你烘焙总是有原因的。
You always bake for a reason.

441
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:06,556
所以，你尽你所能做到最好。
So, you make it the best you can.

442
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:07,958
你用爱来创造它。
And you make it with love.

443
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,780
投降。我不想伤害你。
Surrender. I don't wanna hurt you.

444
00:31:33,814 --> 00:31:34,847
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

445
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,020
一个小的建议。
A little advice.

446
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:42,388
永远不要测试豚鼠。好吗?
Never test a guinea pig. Okay?

447
00:31:52,063 --> 00:31:54,531
我不敢相信他真的跟她走了。
I can't believe he really left with her.

448
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:57,601
我说话的时候，他们可能正在外面玩捉迷藏。
They're probably out there playing fetch together as I speak.

449
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,003
哦，他给我留下了奶酪!
Ooh, he left me cheese!

450
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:03,806
我没法一直生他的气。
Ah, I can't stay mad at the guy.

451
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:07,909
的帮助。
Help.

452
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,047
的帮助。
Help.

453
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,814
超人吗?
Superman?

454
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,693
小狗，起来，走开!
Pup, up, and away!

455
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:40,872
你对他做了什么?
What have you done to him?

456
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:45,543
我看到有人找到了他的药。
I see someone found his medicine.

457
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:51,082
一小块绿色氪星石巧妙地藏在一大块加尔斯堡石里。
A tiny shard of green kryptonite cleverly concealed in a hunk of Jarlsberg.

458
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:54,118
他们总是把它放在奶酪里。
They always put it in the cheese.

459
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,026
你把我从莱科斯身边带走，所以现在我要把超人从你身边带走。
You took me away from Lex, so now I'm taking Superman away from you.

460
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,696
别担心，这只是我邪恶计划的第一步。
Oh, uh, don't worry, this is only step one of my evil plan.

461
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,898
有更多的。
There's more.

462
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:10,933
不。
No.

463
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:16,470
必须保护超级…
Must protect Super...

464
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:35,654
超人!
Superman!

465
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:36,731
我必须找到……
I have to find...

466
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,496
嗯?
Huh?

467
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,833
的父亲。
Father.

468
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:54,237
是的，是我，狗-艾尔。
Yes, it is I, Dog-El.

469
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:59,474
当你还是只小狗的时候，我把我所有的知识都记录在你的项圈里。
When you were just a puppy, I recorded all my knowledge in your collar.

470
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:03,611
我知道。你过去一直帮我，现在我真的很需要你。
I know. You've always helped me in the past, and I could really use you now.

471
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:06,847
是的，是我，狗-艾尔。
Yes, it is I, Dog-El.

472
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,917
我们真的需要一个跳过介绍按钮。
We really need a skip-intro button.

473
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:12,987
告诉我，我的儿子。有什么问题吗?
Talk to me, my son. What seems to be the problem?

474
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,522
超人。他被抓获。
Superman. He's been captured.

475
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,092
嗯。
Hmm.

476
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,928
我很抱歉。我知道你离我有多近。
I'm sorry. I know how close you are.

477
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:24,931
是的，我是说，我们是。
Yeah, I mean, we were.

478
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:27,765
你总不能坐在那儿伤心吧。
Well, you just can't sit there feeling sad.

479
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,801
你得去救他。
You have to go rescue him.

480
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,070
你是对的。
You're right.

481
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:35,772
我会救超人，等我救了他，他就会意识到我是他唯一需要的朋友。
I'll save Superman, and when I do, he'll realize that I'm the only friend he ever needs.

482
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:41,645
嗯…那不是我…但如果我没有超能力我怎么能成为英雄呢?
Uh... That's not exactly what I... But how am I supposed to be a hero when I don't have my powers?

483
00:34:41,678 --> 00:34:44,814
不是超能力让你成为英雄的，克瑞普。
It's not superpowers that make you a hero, Krypto.

484
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,582
那不是你的问题。
That's not your problem.

485
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:48,251
那是什么?
Then what is it?

486
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:52,955
-你的问题是你自己。——你……我吗?你什么意思，我?父亲吗?
- Your problem is you. - You... Me? What do you mean, me? Father?

487
00:34:58,194 --> 00:34:59,295
啊哈!
A-ha!

488
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:01,762
那一定是可恶的啮齿动物。
That must be the vile rodent.

489
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:04,798
别担心，超人，不救你我不会休息的。
Don't worry, Superman, I won't rest until I rescue you.

490
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:10,570
这是非常安静的。
This is very restful.

491
00:35:10,603 --> 00:35:11,804
是的。
Yes.

492
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,577
哎呦。
Whoops.

493
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,279
我们得努力解决这个问题。
We're gonna have to work on that.

494
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:25,083
我从来不知道星星还能这么美，而且有这么多星星。
I never knew the stars could be this beautiful, and there's so many of them.

495
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,119
看,有一个。哦，还有一个。
Look, there's one. Oh, there's another one.

496
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:28,886
看，还有一个。
Look, there's one, too.

497
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,789
嗯!这些星星都是垃圾。等我们到了农场。
Eh! These stars are crap. Wait till we get to the farm.

498
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:36,693
是的。农场里的一切都好。
Yeah. Everything's better at the farm.

499
00:35:36,726 --> 00:35:38,795
哦!哦,是的。
Oh! Oh, yeah.

500
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:40,331
嗯,是的,关于…关于农场。
Um, yeah, about... about the farm.

501
00:35:40,364 --> 00:35:41,797
看到的,理解这一点。
See, understand this.

502
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:47,703
总是有一个字面上的解释，然后…然后更…她在哪里呢?在哪里…?
There's always a literal interpretation and then... and then a more... Where is she? Where...?

503
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:50,039
在哪里…?
Where...?

504
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:52,141
好的。在那里……她在哪里呢?
Okay. Where... Where is she?

505
00:35:54,176 --> 00:35:56,611
好的。她在哪里呢?
Okay. Where is she?

506
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:57,945
啊。
Ugh.

507
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,780
我很抱歉。我很抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

508
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:03,317
我以前从没真正跑过步。
I've, uh, I've never really run before.

509
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:06,019
我…我通常会“小狗，爬起来，走开。”
I... I usually "Pup, up, and away."

510
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:08,687
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

511
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:10,257
我没事，我没事。
I'm fine, I'm fine.

512
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,193
我只是，被车撞了一下。
I was just, uh, hit by a car a little.

513
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:16,594
你永远不会忘记你的第一次。
You never forget your first time.

514
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,067
等等，我在哪儿见过你?
Wait a minute, where do I know you from?

515
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,334
我不能把爪子放在上面。
I can't put my paw on it.

516
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:24,969
她在哪里呢?
Where is she?

517
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:32,708
哇。我看到的超能力是你的吗?
Whoa. So, the powers I saw were yours?

518
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:34,610
你们这些流氓可以帮我。
You hooligans can help me.

519
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:39,248
快点，时间不多了。我们必须拯救超人。
Hurry, there isn't much time. We have to save Superman.

520
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:40,649
超人吗?
Superman?

521
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:46,254
哦,当然!你就是那个害我回监狱的超级蠢蛋。
Oh, of course! You're that super dork who got me thrown back in the slammer.

522
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,957
是什么?之道?胖子吗?你叫什么名字?
What was it? Creepo? Crisco? What's your name?

523
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,993
不。是超级狗氪星!
No. It's Krypto the Super dog!

524
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:53,395
哦!
Oh!

525
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,062
看来我们现在都是超级英雄了。
Well, it looks like we're both super now.

526
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,796
你知道吗，我还欠你一顿。
You know, I still owe you a whuppin'.

527
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,631
——Hi-yah !——噢!
- Hi-yah! - Ow!

528
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:00,101
那是我的好眼睛。
That was my good eye.

529
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,136
现在,等待。这本该是一场公平的战斗。
Now, wait. It was supposed to be a fair fight.

530
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:05,381
你为什么不用从耳朵里冒出来的冷热堵住我?
Why didn't you block me with some freeze heat that was coming out your ears or something?

531
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:09,708
因为,我…我…我没有超能力了。
Because, I... I... I don't have my powers.

532
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,343
什么?
What?

533
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:14,246
我说我已经没有超能力了。
I said I don't have my powers anymore.

534
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,747
丫……吗?
Did ya...?

535
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:18,016
你没有能力了?
You don't have your powers?

536
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,284
是啊，就是这样。
Yeah, that's what's going on.

537
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,820
你现在只是想利用我们，因为你一个人应付不了。
You're just trying to use us now, because you can't handle it on your own.

538
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:31,861
听着，我知道这些能力对你来说很陌生，但是当一个人拥有足够的能力... ...他们有一定的责任使用这种权力来…
Look, I know these powers are new to you, but when one has an abundance of power... ...they have a certain duty to use that power to...

539
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:38,400
对不起。你刚才说什么?
Sorry. You were sayin' somethin'?

540
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:43,871
我在做鼓舞人心的英雄演讲。
I was making an inspiring hero speech.

541
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,811
你喝了多少?
How much did you have to drink?

542
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:53,147
我有两个抽水马桶和一个坐浴盆。
I had two toilet bowls and a bidet.

543
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,690
还有个坐浴盆，这太疯狂了。
A bidet, too, which is, which is crazy.

544
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:55,992
我都不知道还有这种东西。
I didn't even know that was a thing.

545
00:37:56,016 --> 00:37:57,451
但它就像个狗饮水器。
But it's like a dog water fountain.

546
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,819
你恶心的动物。
You disgusting animal.

547
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:01,254
收拾行李，我们出发。
Pack, let's roll out.

548
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:03,688
我再也见不到你了，缉毒警肯特。
I'll see you never, Narc Kent.

549
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:07,326
不!我最好的朋友有危险，你得帮我。
No! My best friend is in danger, and you have to help me.

550
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,227
抱歉，我们有其他安排。
Sorry, we got other plans.

551
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:12,796
祝你好运。我们要去农场。
Good luck with your danger. We're going to the farm.

552
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,301
哦,耶!生菜树木,宝贝!
Oh, yeah! Lettuce trees, baby!

553
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:18,969
“莴苣树”?这个农场叫什么?
"Lettuce trees"? What's this farm called?

554
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:20,337
农场北部。
The farm upstate.

555
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,973
听起来的。
That sounds made-up.

556
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:24,840
噢,是吗?你怎么知道?
Oh, yeah? Well, how would you know?

557
00:38:24,874 --> 00:38:27,944
我在农场长大。在一个叫史摩维尔的小镇。
I grew up on a farm. In a town called Smallville.

558
00:38:27,977 --> 00:38:30,113
这听起来像是瞎编的。
Now that sounds made-up.

559
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:33,781
那么，这个所谓的农场在哪里?
So, which way is this so-called farm?

560
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,317
它的北部。
Well, it's upstate.

561
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,086
所以,这……这意味着它的…这是明显的。
So, that... that means it's... it's up, obviously.

562
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,322
好的。他不会告诉你…我能占用你一点时间吗?
Okay. He's not telling you the... Can I steal you for a sec?

563
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,426
农场的事你撒谎了，对吧?
You lied about the farm, didn't you?

564
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:48,329
大的时间。我得给他们一些希望。
Big time. Look, I had to give them some hope.

565
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:50,439
-那里有一个。-没人会收养我们的
- There's one there. - No one was ever gonna adopt us.

566
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:52,132
也有一个。
There's one, too.

567
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,867
所以，我答应他们这将是他们的新家。
So, I promised them it would be their new home.

568
00:38:57,437 --> 00:39:00,439
我很乐意带你和你的朋友们去我的农场。
You know, I'd be happy to take you and your friends to my farm.

569
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:05,277
如果你帮我救超人。
If you help me save Superman.

570
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:07,979
等一下。这是敲诈吗?你在勒索我吗?
Wait a minute. Is this blackmail? Are you blackmailing me?

571
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:13,351
不。我只是想让你做点事，作为回报我不会泄露有害信息。
No. I'm just asking you for something, which I will reward you for by not revealing damaging information.

572
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,486
这就是勒索的真正含义。
That is literally the definition of blackmail.

573
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,822
好吧。我们会帮你找回你的蠢主人。
Fine. We'll help you get your dumb owner back.

574
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:22,025
你有一个超级团队。
You got yourself a super team.

575
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:25,860
刚才是不是有人说超级战队?
Did someone just say super team?

576
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:28,830
耶。等待我的命运。
Yay. My destiny awaits.

577
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:40,941
可怕的恶棍，致命的刺客，我来招募你们进行一场凶残的野蛮围攻!
Terrifying villains, deadly assassins, I have come to recruit you for a siege of murderous savagery!

578
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:46,313
我的伙伴，皮货商，豚鼠。
My fellow, furrier, guinea pigs.

579
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:49,549
我找到你是因为你是顶级掠食者。
I have sought you out because you are apex predators.

580
00:39:49,582 --> 00:39:51,451
人在神!
Gods amongst men!

581
00:39:55,988 --> 00:40:03,961
好,看。猪对猪，我需要你的帮助因为我的主人陷入了困境。
Okay, look. Pig to pig, I need your help because my owner has gotten himself into a bit of a pickle.

582
00:40:03,995 --> 00:40:08,266
在正义联盟的阻挠下，莱克斯·卢瑟身陷囹圄。
Thwarted by the Justice League, Lex Luthor now finds himself behind bars.

583
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:10,268
我要把你们都灭了!
I'll destroy you all!

584
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:11,834
那是我最好的朋友。
That's my best friend.

585
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,370
和导师。最好的朋友和导师。
And mentor. Best friend and mentor.

586
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:22,978
斯特瑞克岛是为关押可怕的超能力罪犯而建造的，是世界上最无法逃脱的监狱。
Built to house fearsome super powered criminals, Stryker's Island is the world's most inescapable prison.

587
00:40:23,012 --> 00:40:25,281
这就是你们这些笨蛋的用武之地。
Which is where you dorks come in.

588
00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:29,816
如果我要把莱科斯从那个破地方救出来，我需要一支军队。
You see, if I'm gonna get Lex outta that dump, I'm gonna need an army.

589
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:36,857
其实，我觉得我们还是待在这里比较好。
Um, actually, I think we'd just rather stay here.

590
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,526
是啊，我们有暑假，可以尽情喝水。
Yeah, I mean, we get summers off, all-you-can-drink water.

591
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:47,166
我们甚至每分钟都有西班牙语课。
We even have Spanish class every miercoles.

592
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,971
哦，你什么都没有……直到你从冰冷的权力的钢吸管中舔过。
Oh, you have nothing... until you've licked from the cold steel straw of power.

593
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:04,114
没有那么快。
Not so fast.

594
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:06,884
露易丝·莱恩跟我们提过你，仓鼠。
Lois Lane told us all about you, hamster.

595
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:10,386
仓鼠吗?仓鼠是……是沙包!
Hamster? A hamster is a... is a hacky sack!

596
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,222
仓鼠是一种午餐吃太多的老鼠!
A hamster is a mouse that had too much for lunch!

597
00:41:13,256 --> 00:41:17,359
我们是小白鼠，等我们搞定你，老兄，你就知道了。
We are guinea pigs and when we're through with you, buster, you'll know it.

598
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,527
嗯。
Hmm.

599
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:43,549
这是怎么呢那是你进攻的信号。
What's going on? That was your cue to attack.

600
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:46,318
嗯…哦,对不起。我…我在等他先走。
Uh... Oh, sorry. I... I was waiting for him to go first.

601
00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:50,922
但如果我先走，你的火会融化我的冰，所以也许…应该让空姐先来?
Yeah, but if I went first, your fire would melt my ice, so maybe the... the wing lady should go first?

602
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,123
我有名字。
I have a name.

603
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:55,636
但之后我会点燃她的翅膀，我想我们都不希望那样。
But then I'd set her wings on fire, and I don't think any of us want that.

604
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,962
你不会想在鸡翅上加冰的。
Well, you don't want ice on wings.

605
00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,472
——为什么?——他们……它堵塞了羽毛。
- Why? - They... It clogs the feathers.

606
00:41:59,496 --> 00:42:01,131
只是让他!
Just get him!

607
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:14,477
哇!这是有趣的。
Whoo! That was fun.

608
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:17,212
现在，我们去救莱科斯。
Now then, let's go free Lex.

609
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:20,081
嗯?
Huh?

610
00:42:25,185 --> 00:42:26,487
这事到此为止，妹妹。
This ends now, sister.

611
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,123
你在我的真理套索里。
I have you in my Lasso of Truth.

612
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:31,057
你想知道真相?
Oh, you want the truth?

613
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,625
这双靴子有点多。
The boots are a bit much.

614
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:47,205
这真的是找到超人的最好方法吗?
Is this really the best way to find Superman?

615
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:49,140
因为对我来说，这太恶心了。
Because to me, this just seems gross.

616
00:42:49,173 --> 00:42:51,008
你说恶心是什么意思?
What do you mean, gross?

617
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,686
嗅东西是作为一只狗最大的乐趣之一。
Smelling stuff is one of the greatest joys of being a dog.

618
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,478
仅次于舔你身体的任何部位。
Next to licking any part of your body.

619
00:42:54,512 --> 00:42:56,312
我是说，我一直在舔自己。
I mean, I lick myself all the time.

620
00:42:56,346 --> 00:42:58,181
这就解释了他的呼吸。
Well, that explains the breath.

621
00:42:58,214 --> 00:43:00,550
你想找到露露，救出发胶队长，对吗?
You wanna find Lulu and rescue Captain Hair Gel, right?

622
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,485
我建议你开始闻。
Well, I suggest you start sniffing.

623
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,255
你知道人们常说，嗅觉是鼻子的视觉。
You know what they say, smell is the sight of the nose.

624
00:43:06,288 --> 00:43:07,523
没人这么说。
No one says that.

625
00:43:07,556 --> 00:43:08,991
他们应该。检查它。
Well, they should. Check it.

626
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:10,993
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

627
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:13,361
一只贵宾犬在这里流口水。
A poodle drooled right here.

628
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:15,739
有人往垃圾箱里扔了块好吃的披萨皮。
Someone threw a perfectly good pizza crust in that dumpster right there.

629
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:20,534
在那个角落……那边的那个角落……哦,不。见鬼。
And on that corner... That corner right there... Oh, no. Dang.

630
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,969
一只鸽子心碎了。我还能闻到伤痛的味道。
A pigeon got her heart broken. I can still smell the hurt.

631
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:24,671
她是个爱哭的人。
She was a heavy crier.

632
00:43:24,704 --> 00:43:27,274
这是每只狗都有的超能力。
It's a superpower that every dog possesses.

633
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:28,674
即使是像你这样的怪人。
Even a wack one like you.

634
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,743
我不是怪人。
I'm not wack.

635
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,411
哦!
Oh!

636
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:37,615
那是创可贴吗?
Ooh, is that a band-aid?

637
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:52,563
——这是walk-o点。——What-oh-what ?
- It's walk-o'clock. - What-oh-what?

638
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,397
——什么都没有。——好的。
- Nothing. - Okay.

639
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,367
因为这听起来像是你和主人散步时得到的超级可爱的昵称。
Because it sounded like a super adorable nickname you got for your walks with your owner.

640
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:02,737
好吧，也许这是我以前和超人一起玩的时候。
All right, maybe this is when me and Supes used to hang out.

641
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:05,307
每天早上，从我还是只小狗的时候。
Every morning, since I was a puppy.

642
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,643
哦!也许你没有超人，但至少你有我们。
Aw! Well, you might not have your Superman, but at least you have us.

643
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:11,745
一个超级团队!
A whole super team!

644
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:13,714
强大的呼噜声!
The Mighty Oink!

645
00:44:13,747 --> 00:44:15,249
Squirrelverine。
Squirrelverine.

646
00:44:16,183 --> 00:44:17,584
Droolo。
Droolo.

647
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:19,118
严重吗?Droolo吗?
Seriously? Droolo?

648
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:21,154
等等，轮子上的贝壳在哪里?壳吗?
And wait, where's Shell-on-wheels? Shell?

649
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:24,390
怎么了，亲爱的?
What's happenin', sweet cheeks?

650
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:29,661
啊，我明白了。坚强，沉默的类型。
Ah, I get it. The strong, silent type.

651
00:44:29,695 --> 00:44:32,130
谁需要的话?
Who needs words?

652
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:34,265
我真希望我还有超能力。
Man, I wish I still had my powers.

653
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,067
是啊，他们到底怎么了?
Yeah, what happened to them anyway?

654
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,435
我吃了一些绿色的氪石。
I ate some green kryptonite.

655
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:40,104
氪星人唯一的弱点。
A Kryptonian's only weakness.

656
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:42,472
你为什么要吃掉你的弱点，你个笨蛋?
Why would you eat your weakness, you dum-dum?

657
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:44,808
它在一些奶酪里。
It was in some cheese.

658
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:47,677
狗唯一的弱点。
A dog's only weakness.

659
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:49,713
我曾经吃过一只玩具恐龙。
Well, I ate a toy dinosaur once.

660
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:53,816
如果我们不这么做，我想说在那东西消失之前你大概还有整整两天。
If we're goin' off that, I'd say you probably got a solid two days until that thing passes.

661
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,252
除非是剑龙，然后你就祈祷。
Unless it's a stegosaurus, and then you just pray.

662
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:58,005
你们看!
You guys, look!

663
00:45:03,658 --> 00:45:05,793
好吧，神奇女侠会阻止她。
M'kay, Wonder Woman will stop her.

664
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:08,762
女神,不!
Goddess, no!

665
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:11,765
嗯…
Um...

666
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:16,269
听起来像是骨头断了。
That sounded like a bone breaking.

667
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:19,572
真的是这样吗?
Is that even how it works?

668
00:45:23,642 --> 00:45:25,710
我想这取决于我们。
I guess it's down to us.

669
00:45:25,744 --> 00:45:28,213
谁准备好去救我最好的朋友了?
Who's ready to go save my best friend?

670
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:30,749
你想让我们跟她打?
You want us to fight her?

671
00:45:30,782 --> 00:45:33,317
她刚干掉了整个正义联盟!
She just took out the whole Justice League!

672
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,719
它们都有可对立的拇指。
And they all have opposable thumbs.

673
00:45:35,753 --> 00:45:39,656
我死后你要记得我，法布里齐奥。
Remember me when I'm gone, Fabrizio.

674
00:45:43,593 --> 00:45:46,362
伙计,放松。我们会好起来的。
Guys, relax. We'll be fine.

675
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,502
他们为什么这么生气?
Why are they so mad?

676
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,474
你看到了什么?完全好了。
You see? Totally fine.

677
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,744
现在，让我们逞英雄吧。
Now, let's hero up.

678
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:06,780
好了，队员们，你们的数据如何?
All right, team, what are your stats?

679
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:11,751
比如，我的超能力包括热视觉，冻结呼吸…别忘了还有太阳能爪拳。
Like, my powers include heat vision, freeze breath... And don't forget the Solar Paw Punch.

680
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:15,120
那是什么?
What is that?

681
00:46:15,154 --> 00:46:17,256
是果汁盒口味的吗?
Is that like a juice box flavor or something?

682
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:20,692
不，这是氪星最强大的招数。
No, it's Krypto's most powerful move.

683
00:46:20,725 --> 00:46:30,334
它要求他直接飞向太阳，吸收太阳的致命辐射，把自己变成一个狗形的热能事件。
It requires him to fly directly to the sun and absorb its deadly radiation, turning himself into a dog-shaped thermal energy event.

684
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:33,604
连超人自己都没试过。
Not even Superman himself has tried it.

685
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:35,472
因为他没有爪子?
Because he doesn't have paws?

686
00:46:35,505 --> 00:46:37,807
因为这不是你能挽回的事情。
Because it's not something you come back from.

687
00:46:37,841 --> 00:46:44,780
这一拳造成了冲击波，不仅杀死了被击中的恶棍，还杀死了扔出这一拳的英雄。
The punch causes a blast which takes out not only the villain who gets hit with the blow, but the hero who throws it.

688
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:46,648
听起来是一种可怕的力量。
Sounds like a terrible power.

689
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:47,826
听起来倒是挺不错的果汁盒。
Does sound like a good juice box, though.

690
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,484
我会喝果汁盒。
I would drink the juice box.

691
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:55,522
好的,足够的混乱。谢谢你！我们得走了……我的天哪!
Okay, enough mayhem. Thank you. We gotta go... My goodness!

692
00:46:55,556 --> 00:46:57,491
看谁还活着!
Look who's alive!

693
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:59,928
我们来纠正一下这个小疏忽，好吗?
Well, let's correct that little oversight, shall we?

694
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:10,903
艾斯，展开犬齿护盾。
Ace, deploy canine shield.

695
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:12,471
狗是什么?
What is a canine...?

696
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:18,342
逃避!
Evade!

697
00:47:22,346 --> 00:47:23,547
良好的屏蔽。
Excellent shielding.

698
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:25,516
这似乎非常痛苦。
That seemed incredibly painful.

699
00:47:26,683 --> 00:47:28,618
有人想转换能量吗?
Anybody wanna switch powers?

700
00:47:30,587 --> 00:47:31,688
你了,猪。
You're up, pig.

701
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:33,723
好了，PB，往大了想!
Okay, PB, think big!

702
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,968
松鼠，把灯点亮。
Squirrel, light 'em up.

703
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:51,538
不,不,不。我不能。
No, no, no. I can't.

704
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:52,874
你当然可以。
Of course you can.

705
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:54,517
我是说，能发生的最坏的情况是什么?
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

706
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:57,812
我可能会伤害别人。或者他们会伤害我。
I could hurt someone. Or they could hurt me.

707
00:47:57,845 --> 00:48:01,247
也许我被冻成这样是最糟糕的事。
Or maybe me freezing like this is the worst thing.

708
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:07,820
乌龟，用你的速度抓住他们…在上面。
Turtle, use your speed and get them... On it.

709
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,794
我在哪里?
Where the am I?

710
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:22,232
你们是糟糕的超级英雄。
You guys are terrible superheroes.

711
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:25,702
我不明白你为什么不明白。
I don't understand why you're not getting this.

712
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:28,806
是啊，我们之间有很多事你都不了解，傻瓜。
Yeah, well, there's a lot that you don't understand about us, you fool.

713
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,673
如果你注意…嗯?
Maybe if you paid attention to... Huh?

714
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,574
-我注意听了——帮助。
- Oh, I'm paying attention. - Help.

715
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,010
One-hundo百分比的注意。
One-hundo percent attention.

716
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:36,678
他的腹肌又厚又肿
So thick and swole, his abs.

717
00:48:36,712 --> 00:48:37,880
他的腹肌。
His abs.

718
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,997
对一只没有超能力的狗来说这是很危险的举动。
Risky move for a dog with no powers.

719
00:48:58,031 --> 00:48:59,999
有些人会说英勇。
Some would say heroic.

720
00:49:00,033 --> 00:49:01,901
我会说蠢。
I would say dumb.

721
00:49:01,935 --> 00:49:03,602
超人在哪里?
Where is Superman?

722
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:06,004
我不会说。
I'm not telling.

723
00:49:06,038 --> 00:49:08,539
经典的邪恶。莱科斯会很自豪的。
Classic evil. Lex would be so proud.

724
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:10,308
这真的是因为莱科斯·卢瑟吗
This is really about Lex Luthor?

725
00:49:10,341 --> 00:49:12,543
难道你不明白吗?他在考验你。
Don't you understand? He was testing on you.

726
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:15,779
我们是同事。我们一起是科学家。
We were colleagues. We were scientists together.

727
00:49:15,813 --> 00:49:18,615
你是小白鼠。你的头发掉了。
You were the guinea pig. Your hair fell out.

728
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:23,352
是的。就像他一样。Lex需要我。
Yeah. Just like his did. Lex needed me.

729
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:25,621
这比你的超人强多了。
That's more than I can say for your Superman.

730
00:49:25,654 --> 00:49:27,958
超人需要我。他……他需要我。
Superman needed me. He... he needs me.

731
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:29,524
是吗?
Does he?

732
00:49:29,557 --> 00:49:37,298
因为我很确定他会从他的…未婚妻。
Because I'm pretty sure he's gonna get everything he needs from his... fiancee.

733
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:41,803
哦,不。
Oh, no.

734
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:43,938
你不知道他们要结婚了。
You didn't know they were getting married.

735
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:49,342
我真的很抱歉，因为从我这里听到这些一定很痛苦。
I really am sorry, 'cause this must be so painful to have to hear this from me.

736
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,777
不。你就是在说谎。
No. You're lying.

737
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:52,545
我是吗?嗯。
Am I? Huh.

738
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:57,716
那我干掉他的那晚为什么他的内裤里会掉出这个小玩意?
Well, then why did this little bauble fall out of his Underoos the night I took him down?

739
00:49:57,749 --> 00:49:59,451
看它。
Look at it.

740
00:49:59,484 --> 00:50:01,629
切口很好，但清晰度很模糊。
The cut's fine but the clarity is murky as heck.

741
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:03,754
面对现实吧，神奇狗，你来得太晚了。
Face it, Wonder Mutt, you're too late.

742
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:08,459
你儿子要结婚了。这意味着……再见,狗。
Your boy's getting hitched. And that means... Bye-bye, dog.

743
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:16,801
但别担心，如果超人的生活中没有你的空间了，我相信你可以，在司法大厅里睡一觉。
But don't worry, if Superman doesn't have room in his life for you anymore, I'm sure you can, uh, crash at the Hall of Justice.

744
00:50:29,677 --> 00:50:32,613
哇!她把那条狗扔得很远。
Wow! She threw that dog real far.

745
00:50:32,647 --> 00:50:41,655
你知道有趣的是什么吗?当我看到橙色氪星石给你超能力的时候我还很担心，但后来我想起来了，你就是你。
You know what's funny? For a minute, I was worried when I saw that the orange kryptonite gave you powers, but then I remembered, uh, you're you.

746
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:44,090
来吧，我们走，小猪们。
Come on, let's go, little piggies.

747
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,559
我怎么跟你说的?这不是比西班牙语课好吗?
What did I tell you? Isn't this better than Spanish class?

748
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:48,592
Si。
Si.

749
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:54,699
嘿,露易丝·莱恩。
Hey, Lois Lane.

750
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:56,701
见到你总是很高兴。
Always nice to see ya.

751
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:58,804
说话,Lex。我知道你是幕后主使。
Talk, Lex. I know you're behind this.

752
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:04,142
令人印象深刻的破坏，但不是我的工作。
Impressive destruction, but not my work.

753
00:51:04,175 --> 00:51:06,443
你的名字就在怪物身上。
Your name is literally on the monster.

754
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:13,016
看来我的小宝贝长大了。
Looks like one of my little babies is all grown up.

755
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,818
这是令人毛骨悚然的。
That's creepy.

756
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:17,419
Lex泄漏。你对超人做了什么?
Spill it, Lex. What have you done with Superman?

757
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:23,758
无论超人在哪里，都与我，或我的公司LexCorp International无关。
Wherever Superman is, it's got nothing to do with me, or my company, LexCorp International.

758
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:43,675
嘿!别嚼巴塔朗了。
Hey! Stop chewing on that Batarang.

759
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:49,047
布鲁斯·韦恩为此花了很多钱，然后把它作为礼物送给我。
Bruce Wayne paid a lot of money for that, and then gave it to me as a present.

760
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:51,716
维克，你能解除他们的防御吗?
Vic, can you override their defenses?

761
00:51:51,749 --> 00:51:55,854
当我被困在飞行模式时，我什么都做不了。
I can't do anything while they got me stuck in airplane mode.

762
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:59,991
那些关于外星人入侵的协议，一点都没有。
All those protocols for an alien invasion, nothing for little furballs.

763
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:06,662
这些四足陆地狂人犯了一个巨大的错误，和……哦,哇!
These quadrupedal land maniacs have made a giant mistake messing with the King of... Oh, whoa!

764
00:52:06,695 --> 00:52:08,631
嘿,等等。那是鱼食吗?
Hey, hold on. Is that fish food?

765
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,534
哦，有人饿了。
Aw, someone was hungy.

766
00:52:12,568 --> 00:52:16,504
莱科斯·卢瑟否认参与其中，但自称是"坏人小组"
Lex Luthor denies involvement, but is quote "team bad guy."

767
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:19,540
幸运的是，超人的狗是我们队的。
Luckily, Superman's dog is on our team.

768
00:52:19,574 --> 00:52:21,476
Krypto吗?
Krypto?

769
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:25,146
当然是和超人亲热的狗狗。他会拯救我们。
Of course, Superman's dog he makes out with. He'll save us.

770
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,546
不。
No.

771
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,949
他没有超能力。
He doesn't have his powers.

772
00:52:30,683 --> 00:52:32,786
但其他动物有。
But those other animals do.

773
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:35,956
…难道氪星人就不能和他们一起…拯救大都市?
And... and like, can't Krypto work with them to... to save Metropolis?

774
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,657
是的,。
Yeah, about that.

775
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,826
他不是最擅长对付其他动物的。
He's not the greatest with other animals.

776
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:45,831
他最好快点振作起来，不然雪貂就要统治世界了。
He better get it together soon, or those ferrets are gonna take over the world.

777
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,834
他没事吧?
Is he okay?

778
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,005
看起来他还有呼吸。
Looks like he's still breathing.

779
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,505
是的。他还活着
Yep. He's alive.

780
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:56,840
给钱吧,小子
Pay up, dog.

781
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,645
你赌我还活着吗?
You bet on if I was alive?

782
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,814
没有。我打赌如果你死了。
Nope. I bet on if you were dead.

783
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:06,748
我敢说你当时伤得很重。
I bet you were horribly maimed.

784
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,018
-多么有趣的游戏。——嘿!
- What a fun game. - Hey!

785
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,153
那，这到底是什么地方?
So, what, uh, what is this place anyway?

786
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:12,955
这是什么高级车管所吗?
Is this some type of fancy DMV?

787
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:16,091
你在开玩笑吧?这是司法大厅。
Are you kidding? It's the Hall of Justice.

788
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:19,094
这里是正义联盟出没的地方。
This is where the Justice League hangs out.

789
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:27,034
我打赌他们都是超级亲密的朋友，他们会互相试穿对方的衣服，吃非常有趣的零食，然后他们可能会告诉对方所有的事情。
I bet they're all super tight buds, and they, like, try on each other's clothes and then they eat, like, really fun snacks, and then they probably just tell each other everything.

790
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:31,503
是的。一切。
Yeah. Everything.

791
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:41,080
他看起来很伤心，很失败。
He seems sad and defeated.

792
00:53:41,113 --> 00:53:43,282
所以，这是车管所。
So, it is a DMV.

793
00:53:43,315 --> 00:53:45,950
也许我们应该有个人去跟他谈谈。
Maybe one of us should go talk to him.

794
00:53:45,984 --> 00:53:47,185
没有它。
Not it.

795
00:53:47,218 --> 00:53:50,021
艾斯，你总是知道该说什么。
Ace, you always know what to say.

796
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:18,045
请关注... ...隐形飞机。
Watch out for the... ...invisible jet.

797
00:54:21,714 --> 00:54:23,917
我只想一个人待着。
I just want to be alone.

798
00:54:23,951 --> 00:54:26,585
这是观赏日落的最佳地点。
This is the best place to watch the sunset.

799
00:54:26,618 --> 00:54:29,222
你想一个人待着，为什么不去个更丑的地方?
You wanna be alone, why don't you go someplace uglier?

800
00:54:29,255 --> 00:54:31,824
再说了，你不想救你的超人吗?
Besides, don't you wanna save your Superman?

801
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:33,557
我当然知道。
Of course I do.

802
00:54:33,591 --> 00:54:35,559
他是我最好的朋友。
He's my best friend.

803
00:54:35,593 --> 00:54:36,995
至少我是这么认为的。
At least I thought he was.

804
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:43,034
事情变化太快了，他都没告诉我他要结婚了。
Things are changing so fast, he didn't even tell me he was getting married.

805
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:44,867
你就是因为这个才心烦意乱的?
That's what's got your leash all twisted, huh?

806
00:54:46,937 --> 00:54:49,906
是啊，人是很复杂的。
Yeah, well, people are complicated.

807
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,175
你怎么知道?
How would you know?

808
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:54,176
不,算了吧。
Nah, forget it.

809
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:04,019
你有主人。
You had an owner.

810
00:55:06,154 --> 00:55:07,989
对。那是你的业务。
Right. That's your business.

811
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:09,223
我不会打听的。
I am not gonna pry.

812
00:55:12,093 --> 00:55:13,261
他好吗?
Was he nice?

813
00:55:16,695 --> 00:55:18,031
他们。
They.

814
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,000
我的主人是一家人。
My owner was a family.

艾斯，你为那个小女孩所做的…不。那不算什么
Ace, what you did for that little girl... Nah. It was nothin'.

834
00:56:42,472 --> 00:56:44,974
我只是做了所有狗都会做的事。
I just did what any dog would do.

835
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:47,877
他们就这么出卖了你?
And they just gave you away?

836
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,311
我不怪他们。
I don't blame them.

837
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:51,814
他们只是在保护自己的孩子。
They were just protecting their kid.

838
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:53,381
但你救了她。
But you saved her.

839
00:56:53,414 --> 00:56:54,983
我还会这么做。
And I'd do it again.

840
00:56:56,251 --> 00:56:59,320
这是我人生中最糟糕的一天，但我一点也不想改变。
Worst day of my life, but I wouldn't change a thing about it.

841
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:01,054
为什么不呢?
Why not?

842
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:08,095
当你爱一个人，我是说，你真的爱他，你会愿意为他做任何事。
Well, when you love somebody, and I mean, you really love them, you gotta be willing to do anything for 'em.

843
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:11,297
即使这意味着让他们离开。
Even if that means letting them go.

844
00:57:13,065 --> 00:57:14,400
即使很疼?
Even if it hurts?

845
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:18,203
尤其是。
Especially then.

846
00:57:18,236 --> 00:57:20,704
你知道人们是怎么说狗的吧?
You know what they say about dogs, don't you?

847
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:22,207
永远不要给我们吃巧克力。
Never feed us chocolate.

848
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:24,776
我们无条件的爱。
We love unconditionally.

849
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,636
对不起,先生。
Excuse me, sir.

850
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:45,961
我真的不擅长这个。
I am really bad at this.

851
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:48,997
那是因为你还在学习你的能力。
That's just because you're still learning your powers.

852
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:51,365
每个英雄都是这样奋斗的。
Every hero struggles like this.

853
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:54,168
直到他们有了训练的蒙太奇。
Until they have their training montage.

854
00:58:20,825 --> 00:58:23,894
他们需要更长的蒙太奇。
They're gonna need a longer montage.

855
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:26,363
那些家伙，嗯，他们看起来很糟糕。
Those guys, well, they suck visibly.

856
00:58:26,396 --> 00:58:31,334
是的,我……我同意你的观点，但他们比你想象的要强大。
Yes, I... I can agree with you there, but they're stronger than you think.

857
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:37,106
PB只需要像爱别人一样爱自己。
PB just needs to love herself as much as she loves everyone else.

858
00:58:38,407 --> 00:58:40,442
Chip需要安全感。
Chip needs to feel safe.

859
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:45,180
和默顿……默顿需要绿叶蔬菜。
And Merton... Merton needs leafy greens.

860
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:46,314
你真的很了解他们，是吧?
You really know them, huh?

861
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:47,815
它叫做大学”。
It's called listenin'.

862
00:58:47,848 --> 00:58:51,919
当你和一个人永远关在一起的时候，你会对他有更多的了解。
You learn a lot about someone when you're locked up with them forever.

863
00:58:51,952 --> 00:58:53,420
等一下。
Wait a minute.

864
00:58:53,454 --> 00:58:56,122
露露也和你一起在避难所。
Lulu was in the shelter with you, too.

865
00:58:56,155 --> 00:58:57,390
你对她有什么了解?
What did you learn about her?

866
00:58:57,423 --> 00:59:03,396
那个小白鼠一直在说的就是统治世界和一个手漂亮的秃子。
All that guinea pig ever talked about was world domination and some bald dude with nice hands.

867
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:05,230
莱克斯。
Lex.

868
00:59:05,264 --> 00:59:08,200
当然。Stryker岛。
Of course. Stryker's Island.

869
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:10,335
她一定是去那里救他的。
She must be going there to spring him.

870
00:59:10,369 --> 00:59:12,436
如果我们先到就不会。来吧!
Not if we get there first. Come on!

871
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:17,875
小心……隐形飞机。是的。
Watch out for the... Invisible jet. Yep.

872
00:59:17,908 --> 00:59:19,443
也许挂个牌子。
Maybe put up a sign.

873
00:59:19,477 --> 00:59:21,177
或者用绳子把它绑起来。
Or rope it off.

874
00:59:21,211 --> 00:59:22,812
也许一些锥。
Maybe some cones.

875
00:59:25,181 --> 00:59:28,118
入侵者。入侵者。
Intruders. Intruders.

876
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:30,119
可爱的入侵者。
Adorable intruders.

877
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:34,556
它们太可爱了。
They are so cute.

878
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:38,092
不。那是我的机器人弟弟。
No. That's my robot brother.

879
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:40,461
这是它。
This is it.

880
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:44,332
终于，我们这一代的两位天才，又在一起了。
Finally, the two great minds of our generation, back together.

881
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:46,333
你的宠物来找你了，莱克茜。
Your pet is coming for you, Lexi.

882
00:59:48,068 --> 00:59:50,604
哦，不!哦,天哪!奶酪和饼干!
Oh, no! Oh, gosh! Cheese and crackers!

883
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:04,516
哦,我的天啊。神奇女侠就坐在我现在坐的地方。
Oh, my gosh. Wonder Woman has sat, like, right where I'm sitting.

884
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:08,329
事实上，我觉得我就是她，因为我站在她的位置上，坐在她的座位上。
Actually, I feel like I am her because I'm just, like, in her stance, I'm in her seat.

885
01:00:08,353 --> 01:00:10,363
还有一颗花生卡在座位的缝隙里。
And there's a peanut wedged in the crack of the seat.

886
01:00:10,387 --> 01:00:12,156
现在我在吃她的花生。
And now I'm eating her peanut.

887
01:00:12,189 --> 01:00:14,558
更重要的是，狗能开飞机吗?
More importantly, can a dog fly a plane?

888
01:00:14,591 --> 01:00:17,528
当然。我能飞，这个也能飞
Of course. I can fly. This can fly.

889
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:19,495
就像骑自行车一样。
It'll be just like riding a bike.

890
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:21,431
你会骑自行车吗?
Do you know how to ride a bike?

891
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:23,166
不，我知道怎么飞。
No, I know how to fly.

892
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:26,001
放松点，我们会没事的。
Relax, we'll be fine.

893
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:29,404
不要说!
Stop saying that!

894
01:00:29,438 --> 01:00:30,972
我们永远好!
We're never fine!

895
01:00:48,655 --> 01:00:51,357
是谁把我们击落的?
Who shot us down?

896
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:54,326
神奇女侠的隐形飞机是隐形的。
Wonder Woman's invisible jet is invisible.

897
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,528
它真的更透明了。
It's really more transparent.

898
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:02,266
胡须吗?
Whiskers?

899
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,535
闪开，小猫咪。我们得去斯崔克那里。
Out of the way, cat child. We have to get to Stryker's.

900
01:01:04,569 --> 01:01:07,671
对不起，我不能那样做。露露救了我的命。
Sorry, I can't do that. Lulu saved my life.

901
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:09,239
现在，我必须拿走你的。
Now, I must take yours.

902
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:10,907
再见。
Goodbye.

903
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:28,289
在这里。
In here.

904
01:01:31,393 --> 01:01:32,993
好的。每个人都保持沉默。
Okay. Everybody stay quiet.

905
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,928
哦。
Uh-oh.

906
01:01:34,962 --> 01:01:38,031
——“哦”?-我要…不,没关系。
- What "oh"? - I'm gonna... No, never mind.

907
01:01:38,065 --> 01:01:39,299
不，等等，没关系。
No, wait, never mind.

908
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:40,500
没关系，没关系。
Never mind, never mind.

909
01:01:44,504 --> 01:01:47,973
发生了什么,帅吗?
What's happening, handsome?

910
01:01:48,006 --> 01:01:50,041
拜托，我们都是成年人了。
Come on, we're both grown-ups.

911
01:01:50,075 --> 01:01:51,476
别让我犹豫，好吗?
Don't leave me hanging, okay?

912
01:01:54,413 --> 01:01:56,580
她会来看我们的。
Ay, she's going to see us.

913
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:01,720
PB，我需要你把身体变小一点。
PB, I'm gonna need you to get a little smaller.

914
01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:04,687
我知道，我就是控制不了。
I know, I just can't control it.

915
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:10,260
就算有超能力，我也不像神奇女侠。
Even with powers, I'm nothing like Wonder Woman.

916
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:14,731
一，二，凯蒂来找你了。
One, two, kitty's coming for you.

917
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:18,233
PB，有件关于神奇女侠的事你应该知道。
PB, there's something you should know about Wonder Woman.

918
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,002
赞美她的名字。
Praise be her name.

919
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:22,637
戴安娜非常独立，完全是自己的女人。
Diana is fiercely independent, completely her own woman.

920
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:25,940
如果你真想像她一样，就做你自己。
And if you really wanna be like her, you'll be yourself.

921
01:02:37,516 --> 01:02:40,186
我要把你撕成碎片。
I'm gonna rip you limb from limb.

922
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:42,655
好了，奇普，该点燃那只小猫了。
Okay, Chip, time to light that kitty up.

923
01:02:42,688 --> 01:02:46,191
但如果恶魔激光吞噬了我呢?
But what if the demonic laser gato devours me?

924
01:02:46,224 --> 01:02:47,192
还是我们所有人?
Or all of us?

925
01:02:47,225 --> 01:02:51,730
还是她只会放过我，让我永远背负着生存的罪恶感?
Or she only spares me, and I forever carry the guilt of survival?

926
01:02:51,764 --> 01:02:54,097
奇普，我们都会去黑暗的地方。
Chip, we all go to dark places.

927
01:02:54,131 --> 01:02:56,500
我想过把露易丝·莱恩扔进海里。
I thought about throwing Lois Lane in the ocean.

928
01:02:56,533 --> 01:03:00,437
但你不能把余生都困在自己的脑子里。
But you can't spend the rest of your life stuck in your own head.

929
01:03:00,471 --> 01:03:01,773
你是对的。
You're right.

930
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:04,006
这里真的很可怕。
It is really scary in here.

931
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:07,610
好的。你能做到的，奇普。
Okay. You can do this, Chip.

932
01:03:08,511 --> 01:03:10,111
滚出你的脑袋!
Get out of your head!

933
01:03:16,485 --> 01:03:19,487
好了，我们去默顿探底吧。
All right, let's get to the bottom of Merton.

934
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,423
一切始于1854年的中城。
It all started in Central City, 1854.

935
01:03:24,525 --> 01:03:27,026
我只是个可爱的小婴儿。
I'm just a sweet little purr-purr baby.

936
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,461
你为什么不和我一起玩?
Why won't you play with me?

937
01:03:30,463 --> 01:03:34,334
在60年代的一段时间里，我基本上是一个全职炼金术士。
And I had a whole period in the '60s where I was basically a full-time alchemist.

938
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:36,635
默顿，我们没时间了。
Merton, we don't have time.

939
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:39,071
在这里。试试这些。
Here. Try these.

940
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,574
哇!
Whoa!

941
01:03:42,608 --> 01:03:44,710
你们都不是乌龟!
None of you are turtles!

942
01:03:44,743 --> 01:03:47,612
这解释了很多!
This explains so much!

943
01:03:47,645 --> 01:03:51,348
超级宠物，出来玩。
Super-Pets, come out to play.

944
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:57,354
那个怪物该庆幸我没有热视力。
That monster is lucky I don't have my heat vision.

945
01:03:57,387 --> 01:03:59,455
幸好你有更好的东西。
Good thing you've got something better.

946
01:03:59,488 --> 01:04:00,456
那是什么?
What's that?

947
01:04:00,489 --> 01:04:01,557
我们,你这个白痴。
Us, you idiot.

948
01:04:05,795 --> 01:04:08,329
好了，收拾东西，我有个计划
Okay, pack. I have a plan.

949
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:20,775
再见。
See you in heck.

950
01:04:35,587 --> 01:04:37,188
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

951
01:04:37,222 --> 01:04:38,623
你不说话了吗?
Cat got your tongue?

952
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:42,092
现在!
Now!

953
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:51,467
Boom-boom-boom。在这里,我走了。
Boom-boom-boom. Here I go.

954
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:53,403
Fast太太的裤子。
Mrs. Fast Pants.

955
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,838
喵,喵,buh-bye。
Meow, meow, buh-bye.

956
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,511
哦。
Uh-oh.

957
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:52,789
我还有八条命。
I still have eight more lives.

958
01:05:54,189 --> 01:05:55,657
来吧。
Come on.

959
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:57,225
那有多有趣?
How fun was that?

960
01:05:57,258 --> 01:05:59,227
一枚导弹射进了我的胸膛!
A missile was shot into my chest!

961
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,538
这是一种说法。
Uh, that's one way to put it.

962
01:06:00,562 --> 01:06:01,873
没有别的说法了。
There's no other way to put it.

963
01:06:01,897 --> 01:06:04,565
一枚导弹刚刚射进了我的胸膛。
A missile was just shot into my chest.

964
01:06:04,598 --> 01:06:07,434
多亏了氪星和他的朋友，威胁被消除了。
The threat was neutered, thanks to Krypto and friends.

965
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:10,270
这是惊人的!
This is amazing!

966
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:13,674
——是的!人类保存。——不!
- Yes! Humanity is saved. - No!

967
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:16,609
我的宝宝交了朋友。
My baby made friends.

968
01:06:20,445 --> 01:06:22,247
如果你们都养过宠物，就会明白了。
If you all had pets, you'd understand.

969
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,884
我曾经养过一只猎豹，但它吃了我的房东。
You know, I had a cheetah once, but she ate my landlord.

970
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:27,184
把我的沙发给撕了。
And tore up my couch.

971
01:06:27,218 --> 01:06:28,619
我爱死那沙发了。
Man, I loved that couch.

972
01:06:28,653 --> 01:06:32,924
在Oa星球上，我以为我有一只宠物浣熊，但他以为我们在约会。
On the planet Oa, I thought I had a pet raccoon, but he thought we were dating.

973
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:35,558
所有的海洋生物都是我的朋友。
All the creatures of the sea are my friends.

974
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:39,195
除了那条知道自己做了什么的鳗鱼。
Except for that one eel who knows what he did.

975
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:41,564
是啊，我不太喜欢动物。
Yeah, I'm not really an animal guy.

976
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:43,499
哦!你是过敏还是…?
Oh! Are you allergic or...?

977
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:46,736
小时候，我掉进了一个装满蝙蝠的井里。
As a child, I fell into a well filled with bats.

978
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:54,242
我还能听到它们黑色的翅膀在我周围扇动时的尖叫声，抓挠着我胖乎乎、孩子气的肉体。
I can still hear the screams as their dark wings flapped around me, scratching my chubby, childish flesh.

979
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:56,644
我醒着的每一刻都在受折磨。
I'm tormented every waking moment.

980
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:01,916
我真的认为养宠物对你有好处。
I really think a pet would be good for you.

981
01:07:08,922 --> 01:07:10,489
我闻到露露的味道了。
I got Lulu's scent.

982
01:07:10,523 --> 01:07:11,825
她是这样的。
She's this way.

983
01:07:11,858 --> 01:07:14,728
看看你变成了一只狗。
Well, look at you being a dog.

984
01:07:14,761 --> 01:07:22,580
而且，囚犯们午餐吃的是鸡蛋沙拉……穿过大厅……该死，我觉得有个机器人警卫心碎了。
Also, the prisoners had egg salad for lunch... and down that hall... Oh, dang, I think a robot guard got his heart broken.

985
01:07:23,703 --> 01:07:25,369
德洛丽丝。
Dolores.

986
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,976
我承认，有时候这有点太具体了。
I'll admit, sometimes it can be a little too specific.

987
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:38,782
Lex !我在这里!
Lex! I'm here!

988
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:42,484
-我们终于团聚了。——停止。
- We're finally reunited. - Halt.

989
01:07:43,986 --> 01:07:47,622
啊。学生回到老师身边。
Ah. The student returns to the teacher.

990
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:49,623
哦,很好。你的土拨鼠宝宝。
Oh, good. Your marmot baby.

991
01:07:49,657 --> 01:07:51,292
推它。
Shove it.

992
01:07:51,325 --> 01:07:53,325
我是他最喜欢的走狗，不是你，你这个…
I'm his favorite henchman, not you, you piece of...

993
01:07:57,065 --> 01:07:59,499
现在，我有个礼物要送给你。
Now, I have a present for you.

994
01:07:59,532 --> 01:08:01,902
不在这里，但我有它的照片。
Um, it's not here, but I have pictures of it.

995
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:03,603
失败者,失败者。
Loser, loser.

996
01:08:03,636 --> 01:08:05,338
看看他们那些愚蠢的衣服。
Look at all their dumb outfits.

997
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:08,942
嗯。我消灭正义联盟的邪恶计划。
Huh. My evil plan to take out the Justice League.

998
01:08:08,975 --> 01:08:11,878
哇!你真的学习了。
Wow! You really did study.

999
01:08:11,911 --> 01:08:14,780
噢!等着看这个。
Ooh! And wait until you see this.

1000
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:17,315
好吧，我不知道这是怎么进去的。
Okay, I don't know how that got in there.

1001
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:18,751
没人想这样，对吧?
No one wants that, right?

1002
01:08:18,784 --> 01:08:20,919
很明显，我被黑了。
Well, clearly, I've been hacked.

1003
01:08:20,953 --> 01:08:22,954
好了，我带你离开这里。
Okay, let's get you out of here.

1004
01:08:22,987 --> 01:08:25,022
真不敢相信这一切终于发生了。
Oh, I can't believe this is finally happening.

1005
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:27,058
我不敢相信这真的发生了。
I can't believe this is actually happening.

1006
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:37,533
到此为止，啮齿动物。
This ends now, rodent.

1007
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:39,935
你刚刚被……打败了。让我记住它。
You were just defeated by... Let me remember it.

1008
01:08:39,969 --> 01:08:42,403
超级宠物联盟。
The League of Super-Pets.

1009
01:08:42,437 --> 01:08:44,039
br, br。你好,是谁?
Brring, brring. Hello, who's there?

1010
01:08:44,073 --> 01:08:45,741
超级宠物联盟。
Uh, the League of Super-Pets.

1011
01:08:45,775 --> 01:08:48,542
露露，放弃吧。这是结束了。
Give it up, Lulu. It's over.

1012
01:08:48,575 --> 01:08:51,378
你白痴。你已经掌握窍门了。
You idiots. You're actually getting the hang of this.

1013
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:53,715
我烤面包。我是一个落魄的人。
I'm toast. I'm a goner.

1014
01:08:53,748 --> 01:08:54,815
不是。
Not.

1015
01:08:57,117 --> 01:08:59,385
不!
No!

1016
01:08:59,418 --> 01:09:01,621
再走一步，小狗就成功了。
One more step and the puppy gets it.

1017
01:09:02,756 --> 01:09:07,059
除非你的朋友走进那边的牢房。
Unless your friends walk into those cells over there.

1018
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,828
王牌,攻击。我会没事的。
Ace, attack. I'll be fine.

1019
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:10,663
你会变成煎饼的。
You'll be a pancake.

1020
01:09:10,696 --> 01:09:14,065
好吧，我数到三，然后从二开始，因为我很邪恶。
Okay, I'm gonna count to three and I'll start at two 'cause I'm evil.

1021
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:17,002
两个……好吧,露露。你赢了。
Two... All right, Lulu. You win.

1022
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:19,369
不!别听她的。
No! Don't listen to her.

1023
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:20,838
我们还有什么选择?
What choice do we have?

1024
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:23,007
我不知道他们会这么伤心。
Oh, I didn't know they were gonna be so sad.

1025
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:29,979
他不想进笼子，但为了救另一只，他不得不进。
He doesn't wanna go in the cage, but he has to, to save the other one.

1026
01:09:30,013 --> 01:09:32,081
每个人都很难过。
Everyone is upset.

1031
01:09:50,898 --> 01:09:52,866
让我看看你，我的宝贝。
Let me look at you, my pet.

01:10:17,921 --> 01:10:19,022
莱科斯，你在干什么?
Lex, what are you doing?

1039
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,091
我们是一个团队。
We're a team.

莱克斯，我们曾经是科学家。
Lex, we were scientists together.

01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,427
不。莱科斯，你在干什么?
No. Lex, what are you doing?

1042
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:28,097
我是说，拜托。你不会指望我和一个啮齿动物共享荣誉吧?
I mean, come on. You didn't expect me to share credit with a rodent, did you?

1043
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,432

Lulu, I know you're hurting, but join our pack.

1047
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:47,648
举起,等等!真的吗?
Hold up, wait! For real?

1048
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:49,615

She left us to die in a fire, remember?

1049
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:53,920
但如果我们齐心协力，我们就能离开这里，拯救超人。
Yeah, but if we work together, we can get outta here and save Superman.

1050
01:10:55,188 --> 01:10:57,422
嗯。你真的爱他。
Huh. You truly love him.

1051
01:10:57,456 --> 01:10:58,690
我当然知道。
Of course I do.

1052
01:10:58,724 --> 01:11:00,424
你是一个傻瓜。
You're a fool.

1053
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,761
他只会让你心碎。
He'll only break your heart.

1054
01:11:02,794 --> 01:11:08,531
幸运的是，我要帮你一个忙，在他有机会之前毁了他。
Luckily, I'm going to do you a favor, and destroy him before he gets the chance.

1055
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:10,167
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1056
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:13,938
我忘了说我邪恶计划的大结局了吗?
Oh, did I forget to mention my evil plan's grand finale?

1057
01:11:13,971 --> 01:11:18,440
再过28分钟，整个正义联盟就会爆炸。
In 28 minutes, the entire Justice League is gonna go kaboom.

1058
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:22,945
如果我抓不到我的人，你也抓不到你的人。
If I can't have my guy, then you can't have yours.

1059
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,047
不。我不会让你伤害他的。
No. I won't let you hurt him.

1060
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,818
就一个问题，你被困在笼子里怎么能阻止我?
Just one question, how are you gonna stop me when you're trapped in a cage?

1061
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,618
你也困了，天才。
You're trapped, too, genius.

1062
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:37,859
是的,我知道。但就像在避难所一样，我也有逃生策略。
Yes, I know. But just like at the shelter, I always have an exit strategy.

1063
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,893
嘿,女孩。
Hey, girl.

1064
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:41,828
菜,女王。莱科斯怎么样了?
Dish, queen. How'd it go with Lex?

1065
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:48,034
好吧，我现在可以这么说了，我从没喜欢过他。
Okay, I feel like I can say this now, I never liked him.

1066
01:11:48,067 --> 01:11:49,735
莱科斯会为他的所作所为付出代价的。
Lex will pay for what he's done.

1067
01:11:51,637 --> 01:11:53,205
就在正义联盟旁边。
Right alongside the Justice League.

1068
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:58,777
你逃不掉的。
You won't get away with this.

1069
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:01,947
我带着爱说这些。你们都是失败者。
I say this with love. You are all losers.

1070
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:07,617
你们一直都是失败者，你们将继续是失败者，直到你们的失败者生命结束。
You've always been losers, and you'll continue to be losers until the end of your loser lives.

1071
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:11,921
对了，克里普托，我一定会替你跟超人说再见的。
Oh, and Krypto, I'll be sure to say goodbye to Superman for you.

1072
01:12:19,729 --> 01:12:21,697
好,好,好。
Well, well, well.

1073
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:27,269
这不是正义联盟吗，被我一个人抓住了。
If it isn't the Justice League, captured by me, entirely on my own.

1074
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:29,602
豚鼠几乎什么都做了。
The guinea pig did literally everything.

1075
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,907
是的，不得不承认，感觉不太好。
Yes, gotta admit, doesn't feel great.

1076
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,241
但这一切都是值得的。
But it's all worth it.

1077
01:12:34,275 --> 01:12:36,876
因为你们这群笨蛋要完蛋了。
Because you chumps are going down for good.

1078
01:12:43,016 --> 01:12:44,017
没用的,
It's no use.

1079
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:47,987
这些细胞被设计用来防止任何有超能力的人逃跑。
These cells were designed to keep anyone with powers from escaping.

1080
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,055
你得像超人一样强壮才能出来。
You'd have to be as strong as Superman to get out.

1081
01:12:51,724 --> 01:12:53,891
我们不能就这么放弃。
Well, we can't just give up.

1082
01:12:53,925 --> 01:12:57,929
放弃和知道什么时候结束是有区别的。
There's a difference between giving up and knowing when it's over.

1083
01:12:57,962 --> 01:13:00,998
唔唔。不可能。不是超级英雄。
Mm-mmm. No way. Not for superheroes.

1084
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:02,733
我不是超级英雄。
I'm not a superhero.

1085
01:13:03,734 --> 01:13:05,235
我甚至不是一条好狗。
I'm not even a good dog.

1086
01:13:07,637 --> 01:13:11,007
当我还是只小狗的时候，我答应过要照看超人。
When I was a puppy, I promised I'd watch over Superman.

1087
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,641
我失败了。
And I failed.

1088
01:13:12,675 --> 01:13:14,877
都是因为我嫉妒露易丝。
All because I was jealous of Lois.

1089
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:16,979
谁不会?你看到那些刘海了吗?
Who wouldn't be? Have you seen those bangs?

1090
01:13:17,013 --> 01:13:19,014
Ba-bang !
Ba-bang!

1091
01:13:19,047 --> 01:13:23,918
超人是我唯一的朋友，我害怕失去他。
Superman was my only friend and I was afraid to lose that.

1092
01:13:23,952 --> 01:13:25,786
但你不能责怪自己。
But you can't blame yourself.

1093
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:27,888
我是唯一该受责备的人。
I'm the only one to blame.

1094
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:31,091
如果我真的是他的朋友，无论发生什么事，我都会支持他。
If I really was his friend, I'd have been there for him no matter what.

1095
01:13:32,226 --> 01:13:33,593
我父亲是对的。
My father was right.

1096
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:36,195
我的问题是我自己。
My problem is me.

1097
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,869
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1098
01:13:43,902 --> 01:13:45,871
不，伙计，你很好。
Nah, man, you're good.

1099
01:13:45,904 --> 01:13:48,306
你终于对自己坦诚了。
You're just finally being real with yourself.

1100
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,875
没有真相就没有正义。
You can't have justice without truth.

1101
01:13:50,908 --> 01:13:52,009
谢谢,王牌。
Thanks, Ace.

1102
01:13:52,943 --> 01:13:54,145
但是已经太晚了。
But it's too late.

1103
01:13:56,047 --> 01:13:57,948
你确定吗，佩里托?
Are you sure about that, perrito?

1104
01:13:57,982 --> 01:13:59,592
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

1105
01:13:59,616 --> 01:14:00,683
你的飞行。
You're flying.

1106
01:14:00,717 --> 01:14:01,751
什么?
What?

1107
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:04,354
我…我的权力。
I'm... My powers.

1108
01:14:04,387 --> 01:14:06,122
我回来了!
I'm back!

1109
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:08,290
氪星石已经离开了狗。
The kryptonite has left the dog.

1110
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:10,826
嗯，那闻起来确实像檀香。
Well, that does smell like sandalwood.

1111
01:14:18,766 --> 01:14:21,669
好了，是时候拯救正义联盟了。
All right, time to save the Justice League.

1112
01:14:21,702 --> 01:14:24,004
让我们敲碎一些头骨。
Let's crack some skulls.

1113
01:14:26,173 --> 01:14:28,175
不，你已经做得够多了。
No, you've done enough.

1114
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,177
现在说什么?
Um, say what now?

1115
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:34,780
我一开始是为了救一个最好的朋友，现在我又多了四个。
I started this with one best friend to save and now I have four more.

1116
01:14:34,814 --> 01:14:36,816
哦!他的意思是我们。
Aw! He means us.

1117
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:40,185
我不能让你们为我的错误冒生命危险。
I can't let you keep risking your lives for my mistake.

1118
01:14:40,218 --> 01:14:44,588
但别担心，等这一切结束，我还是会带你们去那个农场。
But don't worry, when this is over, I'm still taking you all to that farm.

1119
01:14:45,223 --> 01:14:46,691
小狗，快起来!
Pup, up and away!

1120
01:14:49,293 --> 01:14:50,327
你相信那只狗吗?
You believe that dog?

1121
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,364
有了情感上的突破，恢复了能力，然后又恢复了。
Has an emotional breakthrough, gets his powers back, and then bounces.

1122
01:14:54,398 --> 01:14:56,833
-我觉得很贴心。——我也是。
- I thought it was sweet. - Me, too.

1123
01:14:56,866 --> 01:14:59,635
说实话，我中等，你知道的。
I'm medium on it, you know, if I'm honest.

1124
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:20,154
是时候让超人死去了。
Time for the death of Superman.

1125
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:22,222
我不太确定。
I'm not so sure about that.

1126
01:15:23,957 --> 01:15:25,825
啊!这家伙吗?
Ugh! This guy again?

1127
01:16:10,497 --> 01:16:12,199
最后一句话吗?
Any last words?

1128
01:16:12,232 --> 01:16:15,702
我喜欢这么说。
I love saying that.

1129
01:16:15,736 --> 01:16:19,005
最后一句话吗?哦，很有趣。
Any last words? Ooh, it is fun.

1130
01:16:19,038 --> 01:16:21,407
嘿。你喜欢我的小笑话吗?
Hey. You liked my little joke?

1131
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,976
把你关在牢房里。
Lockin' you up in the cell.

1132
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,411
很有趣，对吧?对吧?
That was funny, right? Right?

1133
01:16:26,444 --> 01:16:29,080
不，嘿，拜托，是我。爸爸莱克斯。
No, hey, come on, it's me. Papa Lex.

1134
01:16:29,114 --> 01:16:30,849
不,嘿…什么?来吧!
No, hey... What? Come on!

1135
01:16:34,385 --> 01:16:36,453
是啊，我的薪水可不够。
Yeah, I don't get paid enough for this, no.

1136
01:16:37,922 --> 01:16:39,156
锁的大门。
Lock the gates.

1137
01:16:44,027 --> 01:16:45,295
我可等不了那么久。
Ew, I can't wait that long.

1138
01:16:45,328 --> 01:16:47,263
我们现在就开始吧。我想现在就做。
Let's do it now. I want to do it now.

1139
01:16:48,932 --> 01:16:50,300
你确定吗?
Are you sure about this?

1140
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:52,301
我是说，我们可以策划绑架案。
I mean, the kidnapping we could get behind.

1141
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:55,404
我们喜欢绑架，但如果你这么做，他们会死。
We liked the kidnapping, but if you do this, they'll die.

1142
01:16:55,437 --> 01:16:58,906
这就是……你以为我们在干什么?
That's the point of... What did you think we were doing?

1143
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,975
马克,基斯,受到影响。
Mark, Keith, suffer.

1144
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:04,912
下台。
Stand down.

1145
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,225
好吧，氪星，你现在绝对是在跟踪我。
Okay, Krypto, you are definitely stalking me now.

1146
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,750
我好像被吓到了。
I'm, like, creeped out.

1147
01:17:10,784 --> 01:17:12,385
再见。
Bye.

1148
01:17:16,989 --> 01:17:18,357
飞在那里。
Fly over there.

1149
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:20,392
你是说，朝着那个杀人的啮齿动物?
You mean, toward the murder rodent?

1150
01:17:20,426 --> 01:17:21,794
超人在哪里?
Where is Superman?

1151
01:17:21,827 --> 01:17:23,162
你太迟了。
You're too late.

1152
01:17:23,195 --> 01:17:26,431
我要把他送回他来的地方。
I'm sending him back to the place from whence he came from.

1153
01:17:26,464 --> 01:17:27,465
Boop !
Boop!

1154
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,273
不!
No!

1155
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:44,413
什么……这是怎么呢
What... What's going on?

1156
01:17:44,447 --> 01:17:46,048
是啊，有趣的故事。
Uh, yeah, funny story.

1157
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:48,283
我把我的办公室变成了一艘火箭飞船。
I, uh, turned my office into a rocket ship.

1158
01:17:48,316 --> 01:17:49,517
所有亿万富翁都有。
All billionaires have 'em.

1159
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:50,785
这是真的。
It's true.

1160
01:18:01,228 --> 01:18:05,198
克瑞普，火箭上有个炸弹。
Krypto, there's a bomb on the rocket.

1161
01:18:05,231 --> 01:18:10,470
当它离开地球大气层时，它会内爆。
When it leaves Earth's atmosphere, it'll implode.

1162
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:18,577
我们只是咳嗽。走吧!
We're just coughing. Go!

1163
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,145
我来找你了，超人。
I'm coming for you, Superman.

1164
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:23,247
Uh-uh-uh !
Uh-uh-uh!

1165
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:24,448
没有那么快。
Not so fast.

1166
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:29,919
谁能活下来，小狗?
Who gets to live, doggy?

1167
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:32,989
你爱的男人，还是他爱的女人?
The man you love, or the woman he does?

1168
01:18:33,023 --> 01:18:34,991
你一个人救不了他们两个。
You can't save them both on your own.

1169
01:18:42,998 --> 01:18:44,133
怎么了,狗吗?
What's up, dog?

1170
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:46,534
这是什么?爪子巡逻吗?
Ugh, what is this? PAW Patrol?

1171
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:49,971
我不是让你们待在原地吗。
I thought I told you guys to stay put.

1172
01:18:50,004 --> 01:18:51,973
我们什么时候听过你的?
When do we ever listen to you?

1173
01:18:53,574 --> 01:18:55,876
嘘!我无聊!
Boo! I'm bored!

1174
01:18:55,909 --> 01:18:58,178
让我们来看看猛烈的撞击。
Let's get to the fiery crash.

1175
01:19:01,214 --> 01:19:02,381
你节省超人。
You save Superman.

1176
01:19:02,415 --> 01:19:04,083
-从火箭上?-我相信你。
- From a rocket? - I trust you.

1177
01:19:05,318 --> 01:19:07,253
好吧，但是从火箭上?
Okay, but from a rocket, though?

1178
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:11,523
大家一起跳。
Hop on, y'all.

1179
01:19:11,556 --> 01:19:16,194
因为这头猪就要变成火腿了。
Because this pig right here is about to go ham.

1180
01:19:47,589 --> 01:19:49,624
那东西带走了我们的超人。
That thing took our Superman.

1181
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,092
她会是失望。
She's goin' down.

1182
01:19:58,031 --> 01:20:00,065
默顿,触及它。
Merton, hit it.

1183
01:20:15,213 --> 01:20:16,246
唉!
Ay!

1184
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,952
一切都结束了,仓鼠。
It's over, hamster.

1185
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:24,120
仓鼠吗?
Hamster?

1186
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:27,624
仓鼠只是一元店的沙鼠。
A hamster is just a dollar store gerbil.

1187
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:37,065
仓鼠是一种没有什么有趣毛皮活动的花栗鼠。
A hamster is a chipmunk with nothing interesting going on fur-wise.

1188
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:50,042
你了,孩子。像开金枪鱼罐头一样打开它。
You're up, kid. Open it like a can of tuna.

1189
01:21:09,226 --> 01:21:12,697
我帮你松开了。
Well, I loosened it for you.

1190
01:21:12,731 --> 01:21:14,632
伙计，我讨厌刀枪不入。
Man, I hate bein' invulnerable.

1191
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:17,601
我们开始吧。明天会疼的。
Here we go. This is gonna hurt tomorrow.

1192
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:19,235
为什么我不能有弹性?
Why couldn't I have been stretchy?

1193
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:21,029
或者，拿个魔法锤什么的。
Or, like, gotten a magic hammer or something.

1194
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:41,722
不!
No!

1195
01:21:52,732 --> 01:21:54,265
面对它。
Face it.

1196
01:21:54,299 --> 01:21:55,634
——这是结束了。——嗯?
- It's over. - Huh?

1197
01:22:01,774 --> 01:22:09,413
你的超人已经不在了，现在他珍爱的小狗将要…什么?它是什么?
Your Superman is no more and now his precious little dog is about to... What? What is it?

1198
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:11,047
我脸上有东西吗?
Do I have something on my face?

1199
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,082
我长痘痘了吗?它是湿的吗?它是准备好了吗?
Do I have a pimple? Is it wet? Is it ready?

1200
01:22:13,115 --> 01:22:14,383
我应该把它弄破吗?
Should I pop it?

1201
01:22:26,194 --> 01:22:29,163
嘿,家伙。大风扇。
Hey, guys. Big fan.

1202
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:31,999
嗯…你们也看到那只大猪了吧?
Um... You all see the giant pig too, right?

1203
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:34,502
不。他们是怎么……?
No. How did they...?

1204
01:22:34,535 --> 01:22:36,302
你忘了一件事，露露。
You forgot one thing, Lulu.

1205
01:22:36,336 --> 01:22:38,739
不像你，我有朋友。
Unlike you, I have friends.

1206
01:23:09,365 --> 01:23:12,067
你说得对，你确实有朋友。
You're right, you do have friends.

1207
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:15,839
但这种情况不会持续太久。
But not for long.

1208
01:24:00,711 --> 01:24:03,279
露露面前跪下。
Kneel before Lulu.

1209
01:24:11,486 --> 01:24:13,155
哦,来吧。
Oh, come on.

1210
01:24:14,422 --> 01:24:17,693
我说,跪!
I said, kneel!

1211
01:24:34,674 --> 01:24:37,409
-努力跟上，乌龟。——好的。
- Try to keep up, turtle. - Okay.

1212
01:24:37,443 --> 01:24:39,678
猪的生物……跟随我的领导。
Porcine creature... ... follow my lead.

1213
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,583
蝙蝠侠独自工作。
Batman works alone.

1214
01:24:44,617 --> 01:24:48,620
除了罗宾，阿尔弗雷德，戈登特派员…
Except for Robin, and Alfred, Commissioner Gordon...

1215
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,362
不要弄乱我那一半的头发!
Don't mess up my half-fro!

1216
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:07,770
我是潜水侠。
I am Aquaman.

1217
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,376
得到它,松鼠!
Get it, squirrel!

1218
01:25:15,409 --> 01:25:22,750
.．.正义联盟，蝙蝠女，蝙蝠女，我的IT团队，摩根·弗里曼演的那个人，啊，管他呢。
...Justice League, Batgirl, Batwoman, my IT crew, whoever Morgan Freeman played, Ah, what the heck.

1219
01:25:59,783 --> 01:26:04,385
看着吧，你这可怜的狗，我要毁掉你在乎的所有人。
Watch, you pathetic pooch, as I destroy everyone you care for.

1220
01:26:04,419 --> 01:26:07,422
无论你做什么都无法阻止我。
And there's nothing in the world you can do to stop me.

1221
01:26:14,261 --> 01:26:18,765
你说得对，露露，在这个世界上我没办法阻止你。
You're right, Lulu, there's nothing I can do in this world to stop you.

1222
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,433
你在说什么，伙计?
What are you talking about, man?

1223
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:24,004
你那句话的句法结构为什么这么奇怪?
And why was your syntax so oddly structured in that sentence?

1224
01:26:24,037 --> 01:26:26,404
帮我盯着超能力者。
Keep an eye on Supes for me.

1225
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:28,808
他要去哪里?
Where's he going?

1226
01:26:28,841 --> 01:26:32,343
不。不是太阳能爪拳。
No. Not the Solar Paw Punch.

1227
01:26:32,377 --> 01:26:34,278
果汁盒的事?
The juice box thing?

1228
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:35,647
但那样会害死他的。
But that'll kill him.

1229
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,347
Krypto,不。
Krypto, no.

1230
01:26:45,589 --> 01:26:46,890
你说得对，艾斯。
You were right, Ace.

1231
01:26:46,924 --> 01:26:48,424
哇,哇!
Whoa, whoa!

1232
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,660
我还差几个几尼就能养头猪。
I am a few guineas short of a pig.

1233
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:53,462
嗯…
Uh...

1234
01:27:00,602 --> 01:27:01,603
啊!
Ah!

1235
01:27:11,344 --> 01:27:18,685
当你爱一个人，我是说，你真的爱他，你会愿意为他做任何事。
Well, when you love somebody, and I mean, you really love them, you gotta be willing to do anything for 'em.

1236
01:27:18,718 --> 01:27:19,886
即使很疼?
Even if it hurts?

1237
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:22,921
尤其是。
Especially then.

1238
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,857
不!
No!

1239
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,722
伙计，当警犬护盾真没劲。
Man, it sucks being a canine shield.

1240
01:28:39,756 --> 01:28:41,133
现钞。
Oof.

1241
01:28:42,559 --> 01:28:44,760
我觉得我的牙齿还在发光。
I think my teeth are still glowing.

1242
01:28:44,793 --> 01:28:46,862
你救了我的命，伙计。
You saved my life, man.

1243
01:28:46,895 --> 01:28:49,463
你当时正忙着救我们的呢。
Hey, well, you were in the middle of saving ours.

1244
01:28:50,766 --> 01:28:52,500
你知道人们是怎么说狗的。
You know what they say about dogs.

1245
01:28:54,969 --> 01:28:57,014
看来你的超级脑壳里确实有东西。
So, something did get through that super skull of yours.

1246
01:28:57,038 --> 01:28:58,773
别逼我收回。
Don't make me take it back.

1247
01:29:02,809 --> 01:29:05,045
-滚，滚，滚。——再见。
- Bum, bum, bum. - Bye.

1248
01:29:08,648 --> 01:29:11,016
什么?你对我做了什么?
What? What have you done to me?

1249
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:12,885
我陷入困境了，不是吗?
I'm in hot dog water, aren't I?

1250
01:29:12,918 --> 01:29:14,119
不!
No!

1251
01:29:14,153 --> 01:29:15,788
是啊!
Yeah!

1252
01:29:25,896 --> 01:29:27,764
谢天谢地，你没事。
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

1253
01:29:35,738 --> 01:29:37,073
我为你感到高兴，伙计。
I'm happy for you, buddy.

1254
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:41,110
你知道克瑞普救了我吗?
You know Krypto rescued me?

1255
01:29:41,143 --> 01:29:42,544
我知道这种感觉。
I know the feeling.

1256
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:46,181
很久以前他救了我。
He rescued me a long time ago.

1257
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,949
它是一只好狗。
He's a good dog.

1258
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,921
过来,男孩。
Come here, boy.

1259
01:29:57,224 --> 01:29:58,892
嘿。
Hey.

1260
01:30:01,794 --> 01:30:03,763
对不起,Krypto。
I'm sorry, Krypto.

1261
01:30:03,796 --> 01:30:06,598
你知道你永远是我最好的朋友。
You know you'll always be my best friend.

1262
01:30:06,632 --> 01:30:08,800
没有什么能改变这一点。
And nothing can ever change that.

1263
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:15,907
哦，还有一件事。
Oh, one more thing.

1264
01:30:21,545 --> 01:30:22,923
哇，看那个。
Wow, look at that.

1265
01:30:22,947 --> 01:30:27,684
这一切我都计划好了，但是…不，拜托，这就是我一直想象的样子。
I did have this whole thing planned, but... Oh, no, please, this is exactly how I always pictured it.

1266
01:30:27,717 --> 01:30:29,052
巨大邪恶的豚鼠。
Giant evil guinea pig.

1267
01:30:29,085 --> 01:30:31,687
这个…这在我的愿景板上。真的。
This... This was on my vision board. Really.

1268
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,689
你想继续吗?
You wanna keep going?

1269
01:30:33,722 --> 01:30:34,957
是的,我会的。谢谢你！
Yes, I would. Thank you.

1270
01:30:35,991 --> 01:30:41,562

1272

婚前协议。
Prenup.

1273
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,776
捏的布鲁斯!
Squeezy Bruce!

1274
01:30:55,808 --> 01:30:59,178
最好是有执照的玩具，不然我要疯了。
That better be a licensed toy, or I will freak out.

1275
01:31:06,084 --> 01:31:07,085
哦!

1276
01:31:07,118 --> 01:31:09,654
嘿,别担心。我得到了你。
Hey, don't worry. I got you.

1277
01:31:12,723 --> 01:31:14,558
好的,发生了什么?
Okay, what's happening?

1278
01:31:14,591 --> 01:31:15,926
哇，这太奇怪了。
Wow, this is so weird.

1279
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,062
如此美丽!
So beautiful!

1280
01:31:18,095 --> 01:31:21,177
我们都很快的时候，击掌却这么慢。嗯。
High-fiving so slow when we're both really fast. Huh.

1281

塞米西拉的戴安娜王妃，我谦卑地向你们介绍我自己，超级猪，还在头脑风暴。
Princess Diana of Themyscira, I humbly present myself, Super Hog, still brainstorming, to you.

和拥抱的朋友。

1284
01:31:40,915 --> 01:31:42,883
我有祸了。

01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:45,198
没人在乎那个水工。
No One cares about the water guy.

1286
01:31:46,186 --> 01:31:48,154
这个水工知道。

1287
01:31:48,188 --> 01:31:49,789
嘿，我叫基斯。
Hey, my name's Keith.

1288
01:31:51,057 --> 01:31:53,792
小猪猪吻。
Aw, little piggy kisses.

1289
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,161
嘿,烟。
Hey, smokey.

1290
01:31:56,195 --> 01:31:57,629
你看起来有点累。
You're looking a little burnt out.

1291
01:31:57,663 --> 01:31:59,865
需要灯吗?

哦,来这里。

1294
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:04,168
我是马克。和你的名字吗?

1295
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:10,941
所以，你是一只狗。

我是蝙蝠侠。

Yeah, I'm not really great with people.

1299
01:32:17,847 --> 01:32:20,016
可能是因为我的童年创伤。
Probably because of my traumatic puppy hood.

1300
01:32:20,049 --> 01:32:22,752
小时候，我的家人就被夺走了。
As a child, my family was taken from me.

1301
01:32:22,785 --> 01:32:24,754

哦!嘿,老爹

看来你和超人都解决了。

1314
01:33:01,352 --> 01:33:04,355
多亏了你的建议，我也交了一些新朋友。
Thanks to your advice, I made some new friends, too.

1315
01:33:04,388 --> 01:33:06,724
现在我要带他们去史摩维尔。
And now I've gotta bring them to Smallville.

1316
01:33:06,757 --> 01:33:08,517
我答应他们，这将是他们的新……
I promised them that it would be their new...

1317
01:33:11,061 --> 01:33:12,872

01:33:12,896 --> 01:33:14,364
……。
...home.

1319

嘿，奇普顿-和杰西卡怎么样了?-人类和宠物的关系越来越亲密了。她甚至给它戴上了戒指。
Hey, Chip-tonite, - How's it going with Jessica? - We're getting pretty close as person and pet. She even put a ring on it.

不错的服装游戏，PB。

谢谢!它甚至还有磁铁。

1322
01:34:06,676 --> 01:34:08,177
这要花多长时间?
Um, how long is this gonna take?

1323
01:34:08,211 --> 01:34:10,847
我和两个消防员头盔有个火热约会。
I got a hot date with two firemen's helmets.

1324
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,615
剧透一下，他们是双胞胎。
Spoiler alert, they're twins.

1325
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:29,829
你迟到了。
You're late.

1326
01:34:29,863 --> 01:34:33,733
抱歉，我和黑暗骑士在玩捉迷藏。你见过丘伯曼吗?
Sorry, me and the Dark Knight were playing a little bit of fetch. Have you met Chewperman?

1327
01:34:35,168 --> 01:34:36,369
那么无礼。
So disrespectful.

1328
01:34:36,402 --> 01:34:38,003
你们开始。
Y'all started it.

1329
01:34:38,036 --> 01:34:39,404
那么，我们的任务是什么?
So, what's the mission?

1330
01:34:39,438 --> 01:34:40,806
我们可以回答这个问题。
We can answer that.

1331
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:45,277
我们的情报显示有条狗被变异了。
Okay, our intel indicates a dog has been mutated.

1332
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:46,377

1333

我们得阻止他。

嘿，我认识那条狗。
Hey, I know that dog.

1337
01:34:58,054 --> 01:35:00,857
他又大又蓝，快要把我们压垮了。
He's giant and blue and about to crush us.

1338
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:02,858
无法粉碎我们的感情。
Can't crush what we have.

1339
01:35:02,892 --> 01:35:06,228
说它回来。来吧。
Say it back. Come on.

1340
01:35:06,262 --> 01:35:09,064
- - - - - -来吧。-我们已经拥有的无法摧毁。
- Come on. - Can't crush what we have.

喂?
Hello?

1375
01:37:49,606 --> 01:37:52,174
打扰一下。是我。
Excuse me. It's me.

1376
01:37:52,207 --> 01:37:55,043
有什么可爱的动物会放我出去吗?
Are any adorable animals going to let me out?

1377
01:37:55,076 --> 01:37:56,578
也许一只猫?养只猫怎么样?
Maybe a cat? How 'bout a cat?

1378
01:37:56,612 --> 01:37:57,912
不。
Nope.

1379
01:38:00,114 --> 01:38:02,617
我早就知道我的结局会是这样。
I always knew this is how it would end for me.

1380
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:05,118
我早就知道我的结局会是这样。
I always knew this is how it would end for me.

1381
01:38:15,928 --> 01:38:18,230
哦。这是你的。嗨。
Oh. It's you. Hi.

1382
01:38:18,264 --> 01:38:20,198
让我们诚实。
Let's be honest.

1383
01:38:20,231 --> 01:38:22,568
我们俩才是这次行动的幕后主脑。
The two of us are the real brains behind this operation.

1384
01:38:22,601 --> 01:38:24,069
忘记莱克斯。
Forget Lex.

1385
01:38:24,102 --> 01:38:25,870
我们应该合作。
We should team up.

1386
01:38:25,904 --> 01:38:28,506
你觉得怎么样?
So, what do you say?

1387
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:31,075
你想住进一间小公寓吗?
You wanna come live in a studio apartment?

1388
01:38:32,376 --> 01:38:33,410
与你?
Like, with you?

1389
01:38:33,445 --> 01:38:36,279
怪癖变成情况?
Like, pet-owner situation?

1390
01:38:36,312 --> 01:38:41,417
让我想想。是的,是的!答案是肯定的!
Hmm, uh, let me think. Yes, yes! The answer is yes!

1391
01:38:41,452 --> 01:38:43,286
我只是想知道一些关于我的事。
So, just something to know about me.

1392
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:47,389
我热衷于统治世界我的指甲每个月都要修两次。
I'm passionate about world domination and my nails need to be trimmed twice a month.

1393
01:44:10,807 --> 01:44:12,173
去捡!
Fetch!

1394
01:44:21,883 --> 01:44:23,685
这是我的玩具。
That's my toy.

1395
01:44:23,718 --> 01:44:25,920
那为什么在我嘴里?
Then, why is it in my mouth?

1396
01:44:28,756 --> 01:44:30,223
超人。
Superman.

1397
01:44:30,256 --> 01:44:31,492
黑亚当。
Black Adam.

1398
01:44:32,626 --> 01:44:34,293
你的主人也是个英雄?
Your owner's a hero, too?

1399
01:44:34,327 --> 01:44:36,462
反英雄。
Antihero.

1400
01:44:36,496 --> 01:44:39,866
基本上和普通英雄没什么两样，只是更酷。
It's basically exactly like a regular hero except way cooler.

1401
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:43,235
你制定了自己的规则，然后又打破了它们。
You make up your own rules, and then you break them.

1402
01:44:43,268 --> 01:44:48,707
此外，你可以忽略大多数道德和伦理惯例，因为没有人能阻止你。
Also, you can ignore most moral and ethical conventions because no one can stop you.

1403
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:51,242
是啊，听起来很像坏人。
Yeah, that sounds a lot like a villain.

1404
01:44:51,275 --> 01:44:52,711
反英雄。
Antihero.

1405
01:44:52,744 --> 01:44:56,346
如果他反对英雄，那他不就是恶棍吗?
If he's anti a hero, then isn't he a villain?

1406
01:44:56,379 --> 01:44:59,450
承认他是个反英雄，否则黑亚当会毁了你。
Admit he's an antihero or Black Adam will destroy you.

1407
01:44:59,483 --> 01:45:00,985
非常邪恶的行为。
Very villain thing to do.

1408
01:45:01,017 --> 01:45:03,252
这条线很好，我不撒谎。
It's a fine line, not gonna lie.

1409
01:45:03,285 --> 01:45:05,889
不管他是什么，我打赌他飞不了冥王星。
Well, whatever he is, I bet he can't fly to Pluto.

1410
01:45:05,922 --> 01:45:07,724
噢,是吗?看着他。
Oh, yeah? Watch him.

1411
01:45:13,294 --> 01:45:14,596
我的玩具
My toy.
