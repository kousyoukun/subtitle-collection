THAT I WAS FLYING.

IT WAS SUCH
A FINE FEELING.

BUT FROM THE CORNER
OF MY EYE,

1466
01:41:29,351 --> 01:41:31,753
I SAW A WOMAN DROWNING

1467
01:41:31,786 --> 01:41:35,690
IN THE VERY SAME AIR
THAT WAS KEEPING ME AFLOAT.

1468
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:38,893

THAT IT WAS ME.

1469
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,229
SHOULD I SAVE HER?

1470
01:41:43,298 --> 01:41:45,233

VOICE SAYING,

"DON'T LOOK BACK."

1472
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:50,705
