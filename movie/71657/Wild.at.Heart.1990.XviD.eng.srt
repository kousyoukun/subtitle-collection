1
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:23,926
Hey, Sailor, wait!

2
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,972
I got something for you.

3
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:33,237
Marietta tells me you were trying to

4
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,917
fuck her in the toilets.
- Oh, man ...

5
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:40,158
You crazy bad boy, trying to
fuck your girl's mama!

6
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:45,619
Tell me: how does
that little cunt Lula feel about that?

7
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,592
You know ...

8
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,318
Marietta gave me this
to kill you.

9
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,306
And then she said
I'd be able to fuck Lula ...

10
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,619
PEE DEE PENITENTIARY

11
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:38,445
Hello ...?
- Is Lula there?

12
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:40,555
Who is this?

13
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:42,719
Sailor Ripley.

14
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:46,916
Can I ... talk to Lula?

15
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,302
There's no way in hell!

16
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:56,345
If you even think
about seeing Lula, you're dead. - What?

17
00:05:56,867 --> 00:06:01,762
You heard me.
And don't you ever call here again!

18
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,407
Mama?

19
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,514
You know who that was.

20
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,986
And you know you aren't,

21
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:25,885
and I mean are not
gonna see him ever.

22
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:28,356
End of story!

23
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:31,857
Like hell!

24
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:00,191
Lula!

25
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:05,127
Sailor!
- Peanut!

26
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,040
Hey baby!

27
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:14,302
I've got a surprise for you!

28
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:18,823
Hey, my snakeskin jacket!
Thanks, baby! Did I ever tell you

29
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:24,208
that this jacket is a symbol of my
belief in personal freedom?

30
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,774
About 50,000 times.

31
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:30,602
I got us a room at
the Cape Fear. And guess what?

32
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:33,205
"Powermad" is at the "Hurricane"!

33
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:34,698
Stab it and steer!

34
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,374
Jeez Lou-eez, Sailor,
you are something else ...

35
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:26,484
When I was 15,
my mama told me

36
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,581
that pretty soon
I'd be starting to think about sex,

37
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,610
and that I should tell her before
I did anything about it.

38
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,054
But I thought
you told me your uncle Pooch

39
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:38,867
raped you
when you was 13?

40
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:42,093
True.

41
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,843
Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle.

42
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:48,845
He was
a business partner of my daddy's.

43
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:53,534
Mama never knew 'bout me and him ...

44
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,030
that's for damn sure.

45
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:00,618
You know what?
You're a pumpkin.

46
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,533
Oh, my God! Get out!

47
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,796
Uncle Pooch died
in a car crash 3 months later,

48
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:41,948
on holiday in Myrtle Beach.

49
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:45,560
They still got
way too much traffic there.

50
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:48,654
Have you been
noticin' the buildup in traffic?

51
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,574
Here she goes again.

52
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,059
I'm sorry, Sailor,

53
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:56,168
but that ozone layer is disappearin'.

54
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,496
One of these mornings, the sun's gonna

55
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:02,626
burn a hole clean through the earth
like an electrical X-ray.

56
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:04,511
That won't happen, honey.

57
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,093
At least not in our lifetime.
And by then,

58
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,726
they'll be driving Buicks to the moon.

59
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,486
You OK, honey?

60
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,658
That woman's laugh
creeps me out.

61
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:33,253
Like something I've heard before.

62
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,041
Sounded like the Wicked Witch.

63
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:39,714
Just sounded like an old gal
having a good time to me.

64
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,213
You ready to go dancing?

65
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,036
I'm always ready to dance.

66
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:49,522
But I need my kiss first.
Just one!

67
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,798
I'm gonna hire me a hit man, if you
don't help me stop this thing.

68
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:17,423
I'm going to call Marcello Santos.

69
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:24,452
Marietta, I am gonna help you.

70
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:27,159
So don't get carried away.

71
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:30,427
You don't want
to bring Santos and his bunch into this.

72
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,220
You're just jealous of him
'cause he's still sweet on me.

73
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,780
You been seeing him again?

74
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,282
Oh my God,

75
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:45,547
I don't believe this!

76
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:48,054
Johnnie Farragut ...

77
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:54,024
who doesn't even trust
his very own Marietta?

78
00:11:57,232 --> 00:12:00,289
Alright, I'm sorry honey, but ...

79
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:03,234
I just love you,

80
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:06,335
and it just brings out ...

81
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:10,855
That ugly jealous side,
I hate it, God!

82
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,065
No tongue! My lipstick.

83
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:41,261
Sweetheart, I want you
to stop worrying about me,

84
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:47,967
and start worryin' about
how to get Lula from that murderer.

85
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,645
Honey, wait a minute now:

86
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,836
Sailor ain't no murderer.

87
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,624
Now listen to me!
You gotta get off that kick.

88
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:01,837
As far as I know, Sailor was
all clean before he got involved in

89
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,135
in that event with Lula.

90
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:06,464
And even there,
he was trying to protect her.

91
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:10,701
That crazy Bob Ray Lemon was
comin' at them with a knife.

92
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:13,828
He could've killed both of them.
You oughtta be thankin' him!

93
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,949
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

94
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:19,288
You were there,
you saw the whole damned thing!

95
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,062
Didn't you?

96
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:51,578
Sailor boy!

97
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,643
How'd you like

98
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:06,596
to fuck Lula's mama?

99
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,653
No ... ma'am ...

100
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:16,154
I sure don't.
- Lula's mama would like to fuck you.

101
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:22,372
Mrs. Fortune, I really think
you need a cup of coffee.

102
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:26,920
Maybe I was there.

103
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:30,015
But I didn't see anything at all.

104
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:33,737
All I know is,
is that trash,

105
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:37,113
he killed a man
with his bare hands,

106
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:42,640
hands that are probably
all over my baby right now!

107
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:46,047
Oh, honey, settle down.

108
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,944
It's all right, come on now.

109
00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:53,649
It's alright.

110
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,850
Now listen, I want
what's best for her too.

111
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:01,399
I'll do everything I can
to bring her back home, OK?

112
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:24,374
Baby, quit bouncing.
I got one more toe to do.

113
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:27,364
Let's go dancing, Peanut!

114
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,214
I'm ready.

115
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,543
But we better be careful.

116
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,035
Mama's gonna
have Johnnie Farragut after us.

117
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:41,034
He's one clever detective.
You know how clever?

118
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,502
How clever?
- He told me once,

119
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,586
he could find
an honest man in Washington.

120
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:53,926
I just want two more moments,
then my toes will be dry.

121
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:58,298
One thing puzzles me, sugar.
- What's that?

122
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:00,254
You're 20 years old.

123
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:04,177
Ain't you ever curious as to why
your mama wants to keep us apart ?

124
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,229
I'll tell you, Lula ...

125
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,111
it's more than
me killing Bob Ray Lemon.

126
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:23,296
Maybe my mama
cares for me just a little too much.

127
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,044
Yeah, maybe.

128
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:33,019
I just want
to kiss you goodbye.

129
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:37,122
You know too much about Lula's Mama.

130
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,102
What do you mean?

131
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:44,533
Johnnie told me
you were a driver for Marcello Santos.

132
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:48,141
So what?
- So maybe one night,

133
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:50,475
you got too close to a fire.

134
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:57,419
So maybe you're gonna burn.
Besides, you're shit.

135
00:16:58,265 --> 00:16:59,722
You think I'd let my little girl

136
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:03,437
hang out with a piece
of s-h-i-t like you?

137
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:08,200
Kid, you belong
in one of these toilets!

138
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:15,189
You piece of white trash!

139
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,782
You ...

140
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,650
You're gonna have to kill me
to keep me away from Lula.

141
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,665
Don't worry about that.
First I'm gonna cut your balls off

142
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,743
and feed them to you.

143
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,955
You're gonna have to kill me.

144
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,953
I can arrange that.

145
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,687
It's a problem I don't think
is gonna go away too soon.

146
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:54,043
I'm ready to break parole
and take you out to sunny California!

147
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:57,561
Sailor!
- You up for that?

148
00:17:58,222 --> 00:18:00,960
I'd go to the far end
of the world for you, baby.

149
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:02,842
You know that.

150
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,660
Rockin' good news!

151
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:13,090
Are those toenails about dry yet,
sweetheart?

152
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:15,494
We've got some dancing to do!

153
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:13,986
You gonna give me the
opportunity to prove my love to my girl?

154
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:20,174
Or you gonna save yourself
some trouble and apologize to her?

155
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,450
Don't fuck with me, man.

156
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,030
You look like a clown
in that stupid jacket.

157
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,779
This is a snakeskin jacket..

158
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,869
It's a symbol of my individuality

159
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:42,247
and my belief
in personal freedom.

160
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,753
Asshole!

161
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,139
Come here!
- Sailor, honey ...

162
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:57,502
I'm sorry to do this to you
here in front of a crowd and all...

163
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:00,213
But I want you to get up
and apologize to my girl.

164
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,010
I'm sorry.

165
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,921
You just bumped against
the wrong girl, that's all.

166
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:18,847
Get yourself a beer.

167
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:22,734
You fellas have
a lot of the same power "E" had.

168
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,855
Do you know this one?

169
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:47,400
Sail', how come you didn't
sing me "Love me tender"?

170
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:50,868
You told me
that was your favorite love song.

171
00:22:51,296 --> 00:22:55,669
I told you I'd only sing
"Love me tender" to my wife.

172
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:20,936
Did you ever think something ...

173
00:23:21,987 --> 00:23:24,167
you can hear a wind ...

174
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:28,063
and see the Wicked Witch of the East
come flyin' in?

175
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:37,547
I really did miss your mind
while I was out at Pee Dee.

176
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:40,989
The rest of your too, of course.

177
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:45,339
But the way your head works
is God's mystery.

178
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:47,701
What were you thinking?

179
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:54,961
Well, I was thinking
about smoking, actually.

180
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:58,749
My mama smokes Merits now.

181
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:01,915
She used to smoke Viceroys.

182
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,392
I started stealing
'em from her about 6th grade.

183
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:08,803
When did you start smoking, Sail'?

184
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,593
I started when I was about ...

185
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:16,173
four.

186
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:20,300
My mom was already
dead then from lung cancer.

187
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:25,272
What brand did she smoke?
- Marlboros, same as me.

188
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:28,371
I guess both my mom
and my daddy died

189
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,805
of smoke
or alcohol related illness.

190
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:34,206
Jeez, Sail', I'm sorry.
- Its OK, honey.

191
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:37,792
I hardly used to see them anyways.

192
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,575
I didn't have much
parental guidance.

193
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:45,992
The public defender
kept saying that.

194
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:50,791
He was a good ol' boy,
he stood by me.

195
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:56,208
I'd stand by you, Sail',

196
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,054
through anything.

197
00:24:59,238 --> 00:25:00,968
Hell, Peanut ...

198
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:09,589
You stuck by me after
I planted Bob Ray Lemon.

199
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:12,857
A man can't ask for more than that.

200
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:17,306
You move me, Sail'.

201
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,227
You really do.

202
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:24,575
You mark me the deepest.

203
00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:33,225
You're perfect for me too.

204
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:39,937
You remind me of my daddy.

205
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,300
Mama told me
he liked skinny women

206
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:46,642
with breasts
that stood up and said "Hello".

207
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,080
He had a long nose too,
just like yours.

208
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:59,466
Did I ever tell you
how my daddy died?

209
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:02,946
In a fire, as I recall.

210
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:04,992
Yeah ...

211
00:26:05,938 --> 00:26:09,932
Mama told me he poured
kerosene all over himself,

212
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,613
and lit a match.

213
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:38,251
That was the year
before I met you.

214
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:04,740
No, I haven't found them yet.

215
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,874
Just try to take it easy.
- Johnnie!

216
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,879
I'm going to stay
right here, by this telephone,

217
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:16,698
until you find Lula.
And then I'm coming to get her.

218
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:19,692
So call me the second
you get to New Orleans.

219
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,883
I will, honey.
- Please don't let me down again!

220
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,222
I'll miss you.
- Get going! - OK. Bye.

221
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,587
Bye, honey.

222
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:50,516
Well, I guess you
broke parole now.

223
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,432
You guess?

224
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:57,639
My parole was broke 200 miles back,
when we burned Portagee County.

225
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:06,292
I guess I'll send Mama
a postcard from somewhere.

226
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,457
I don't want
her to worry more than necessary.

227
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:13,247
That's not why I
called you here, Santos.

228
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,536
That don't smell like a Kool.

229
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:19,602
It ain't.
It's part of the lessons of life.

230
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:22,835
Just tell me what you want.

231
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:28,644
You ain't gonna start worrying
about what's bad for you?

232
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:34,105
I mean, here you are, crossing
state lines with a real murderer ...

233
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:38,032
A manslaughterer, honey,
not murderer. Don't exaggerate.

234
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:40,669
OK, manslaughterer ...

235
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:46,333
who just broke parole and has only
immoral purposes in mind,

236
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,711
as far as you're concerned.
- Thank the Lord!

237
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:52,762
Well, you ain't
let me down yet.. Sail'.

238
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,113
That's more than
I can say for the rest of the world.

239
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,592
You please me too, Peanut

240
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:07,853
You want me to shoot
Sailor in the brains, with a gun.

241
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:09,933
Yes.

242
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:14,558
In the forehead?
- Yes.

243
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:16,606
Wrong!

244
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:21,092
It's always better to blow a hole
through the back of the head.

245
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:22,868
Right through ...

246
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,340
to the nose.

247
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:30,162
Lots of irreparable damage.

248
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:34,748
See?

249
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,988
I knew
you had it under control.

250
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,989
You are a little slow, but
you're beginning to get it.

251
00:29:43,936 --> 00:29:47,444
Why didn't you send
Johnnie Farragut?

252
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:49,107
Maybe I did.

253
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:54,281
Why don't you
look in New Orleans?

254
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:58,634
Lula always talks about that town.
- On one condition:

255
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,468
You give me permission
to kill Johnnie Farragut.

256
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,652
Santos, please!

257
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,707
You're not telling me
you're that sweet on him?

258
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:11,076
What? No ...
- Are you that sweet on him?

259
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:14,307
No, but ...
- One day he's gonna find out

260
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:18,475
what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer,
and he can cause us a lot of trouble.

261
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,564
I'll take your silence as a "yes".

262
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:28,386
No, ... no, Santos ...
- Shhh, it's OK.

263
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:31,131
It's alright.
- No! You're not gonna kill him!

264
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:35,193
You're not gonna kill him!
- No, no ...

265
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,382
No, not Johnnie.
You kill Sailor!

266
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:45,517
I am going to kill Sailor.

267
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:48,824
You can be certain of that.

268
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:07,795
Hello, Mr. Reindeer.
Marcello Santos speaking.

269
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,710
Mr. Marcello Santos. Hey there!

270
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:17,601
That was great shit
you sent last in last month.

271
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,432
I've got a problem.

272
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,661
A couple of problems, in fact.

273
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:28,233
A couple of problems?

274
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:34,251
For each problem, drop a
silver dollar through my mail slot.

275
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,332
With all particulars.

276
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:40,466
We'll work out
"il conto" later.

277
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,841
Have a beautiful day!

278
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:54,894
We are.

279
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:18,290
Keep them panties up,
we're in Jimmy Swaggart country!

280
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,233
You know what?

281
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,095
That little bitch Susie
stole my comb.

282
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,361
I hate that.

283
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:51,549
The stupid little shit!

284
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:53,466
Phone's ringing.

285
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:04,647
Juana.

286
00:33:05,077 --> 00:33:08,679
A couple of silver dollars
came my way today.

287
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:12,854
I'm sending one to you,
with a paper on the beneficiary.

288
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,716
As usual, you are completely free
to fulfill the obligation

289
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:20,290
in any manner you so desire.

290
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,804
In fact, send
Reggie and Drop Shadow over,

291
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:26,135
for the silver dollar
and the papers.

292
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:27,659
Now.

293
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:33,751
They're on their way.
Who's getting' the second silver dollar?

294
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:35,756
That's for me to know.

295
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,712
Yeah?

296
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:40,452
Thanks, Mr. Reindeer.

297
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:44,029
Have fun, darling.

298
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:01,417
How you doin', my boy?

299
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:05,576
Sometimes, when we're making love,

300
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:11,070
you just about take me
right over that rainbow.

301
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,171
You're so aware of what goes on in me,
I mean, you pay attention.

302
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,000
And I swear, baby,
you got the sweetest cock.

303
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:24,937
It's like it's talking to me
when you're inside.

304
00:35:26,714 --> 00:35:28,930
You get right on me.

305
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:34,530
You are dangerously cute, baby,
I got to admit it.

306
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:40,824
Let's go out
into the crazy world of New Orleans!

307
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:45,160
Let's get a fried banana sandwich.

308
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:58,341
That's about the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

309
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:41,886
Pigeons spread diseases and
mess up the place. You've seen it.

310
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,935
The big N.O.!

311
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:11,434
Santos? I don't know ...

312
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,568
I'm having second thoughts.

313
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,313
Guess what?

314
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,338
There's no turnin' back,
remember?

315
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:27,001
I'm in a killing mood.
- Santos!

316
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:32,569
I saw your boyfriend on Bourbon Street.
- I'm not sure ...

317
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,041
What? Are you in New Orleans?

318
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,536
Crazy fucking bitch!

319
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,020
Ladies!

320
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,419
What are you?

321
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:14,376
You're not just a pretty face
with a fucking smile.

322
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,945
You're here
to make Mr. Reindeer happy.

323
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:19,422
And to show him a good time.

324
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:24,354
Do not bring misfortune
upon yourselves.

325
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:45,797
When I gave you
the silver dollar, I forgot

326
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:48,994
to include
the contents of this envelope.

327
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:51,361
They are to be returned.

328
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:56,991
Show it just before the deed.

329
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:16,933
I knew I had an important lesson
to learn that day.

330
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:21,799
When she got to the top step,
I stuck my hand between her legs.

331
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:25,728
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

332
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:29,549
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

333
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,609
That's just what she said.

334
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:37,926
I had a boner with a capital "O".

335
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:40,395
Anyway, I found her lying

336
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:44,359
in a room filled with
guns and porno magazines.

337
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:48,358
So, I slid
my hand between her legs again,

338
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:51,617
and she closed her thighs.

339
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,571
You're exciting me, honey.

340
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,861
Then what did she do?

341
00:40:56,283 --> 00:40:59,613
Her face was
half pushed into the pillow,

342
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:04,789
and I remember, she looked back
over her shoulder at me and said:

343
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:08,060
"I won't suck you.
Don't ask me to suck you."

344
00:41:08,517 --> 00:41:11,017
Poor baby, she doesn't know
what she missed.

345
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:14,625
What color hair did she have?
- Jet black,

346
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:17,027
but gentlemen prefer blondes.

347
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:19,737
Anyway, dig this:

348
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,820
She turns over,

349
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:25,895
peels off them orange pants,

350
00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:29,679
spreads her legs
real wide

351
00:41:30,102 --> 00:41:33,574
and says to me:
"Take a bite of peach."

352
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:38,960
Jesus, honey, you more than
sort of got what you come for.

353
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:44,591
Baby, you better run me
back to the hotel.

354
00:41:45,013 --> 00:41:47,999
You've got me hotter
than Georgia asphalt.

355
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,362
Say no more,
but go easy on me, sweetheart,

356
00:41:50,782 --> 00:41:53,282
tomorrow we got
a lot of driving to do.

357
00:41:57,352 --> 00:41:59,331
Hotter than Georgia asphalt.

358
00:43:14,408 --> 00:43:19,683
Wouldn't it be fabulous
if we someway stayed in love forever?

359
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:26,150
You think of the weirdest damn things
to say sometimes, Peanut.

360
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:29,975
Ain't we been
doing a pretty fair job thus far?

361
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:34,107
Oh, you know exactly
what I mean, sugar.

362
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:39,180
It'd make the future so simple and nice.

363
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:41,065
I've done a few things

364
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:45,680
in my life
which I ain't too proud of.

365
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:52,010
But from now on I ain't
gonna do nothin' for no good reason.

366
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:55,207
All I know for sure is
there's more than a few bad ideas

367
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:57,183
runnin' loose out there.

368
00:44:01,923 --> 00:44:05,632
There's something
I ain't never told you about.

369
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:12,270
This here's a story with a lesson
about bad ideas.

370
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:13,763
What's that?

371
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:18,979
Well, my cousin Dell was
always fighting bad ideas.

372
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:23,399
See, Dell loved Christmas.
We used to call him

373
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,242
"Jingle Dell".

374
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:28,364
He wanted
Christmas to last all year long.

375
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,819
He sure would scream
when his mom told him it was summer,

376
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,261
and Christmas was
six months off.

377
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:40,571
Also, he said ...

378
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:46,782
he felt there's men

379
00:44:47,211 --> 00:44:50,541
with black rubber gloves who were
following him around.

380
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:55,441
Dell said that trust in the spirit of
Christmas was destroyed

381
00:44:55,866 --> 00:45:01,033
by ideas being controlled
by aliens wearing black gloves.

382
00:45:01,427 --> 00:45:05,350
These aliens would get Dell
to do all kinds of things.

383
00:45:05,945 --> 00:45:09,276
Then he'd carry on about the weather,

384
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:14,073
talk about how rainfall is
controlled by aliens on earth.

385
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:18,411
Aunt Rootie told him
that one day he would realize

386
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,442
that the alien wearing
the black gloves was him,

387
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:24,780
and him alone.

388
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:32,944
Sounds like old Dell
was more than just a bit confused.

389
00:45:35,454 --> 00:45:37,777
Dell was learning a hard lesson.

390
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,051
It got so he would stay up
all night making sandwiches.

391
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,523
Dell, what are you doing?

392
00:45:54,015 --> 00:45:55,922
I'm making my lunch!

393
00:45:57,595 --> 00:46:01,304
Mama told me
Aunt Rootie, that's Dell's mama,

394
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,481
found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

395
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,723
One time, she found Dell

396
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,888
putting one big cockroach
on his anus.

397
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,149
Hell, Peanut!

398
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:24,348
It ain't so funny now, though.

399
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:27,795
Dell disappeared.

400
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:30,159
Nobody's seen him since.

401
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:35,472
Too bad he couldn't visit

402
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:40,164
that old Wizard of Oz,

403
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,538
and get some good advice.

404
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:48,158
Too bad
we all can't, baby.

405
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,935
Are you there, Johnnie?

406
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,541
What's wrong, honey?

407
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:19,863
Johnnie, sweetheart.
Wait, I've got something to tell you.

408
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:23,992
I want you to know something.

409
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:27,228
I've done something so bad,
real bad.

410
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:31,538
What?
- Not on the phone! No ...

411
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:35,884
I'm coming to New Orleans tomorrow
to tell you in person. OK?

412
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:41,164
Don't do this to me. You'd freak out
if I did that to you. Now what is it?

413
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,055
No,
I'm not gonna tell you on the phone.

414
00:47:45,482 --> 00:47:48,777
But honey, I gotta leave right now
and get on their trail.

415
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:52,945
The kids were here. They checked
out of the Hotel Brazil this morning.

416
00:47:53,476 --> 00:47:55,206
No!

417
00:47:55,597 --> 00:47:57,647
Stay right there! Don't go anywhere!

418
00:47:58,064 --> 00:48:00,694
I'm coming in on Piedmont
tomorrow, on the 7 o'clock flight.

419
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,687
We're going after Lula together!
- OK, if that's what you want.

420
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:10,088
But I'm against it!

421
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:13,207
7 o'clock,

422
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:15,578
tomorrow evening. Sugar, ...

423
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,499
We'll have dinner at our
favorite French restaurant, OK?

424
00:48:18,919 --> 00:48:22,320
You fix it up. OK, bye now?

425
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:24,896
I love you.

426
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:28,545
Marietta?

427
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:46,852
How much we got left, baby?

428
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:48,930
Under 100.

429
00:49:49,357 --> 00:49:51,431
You want me to drive

430
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:55,853
so you can get a bit of rest?
- Yeah, that'd be good.

431
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:17,153
Come in, San Antonio, Texas.
What's on your mind this evening?

432
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:20,282
I just had triple bypass,
open-heart surgery,

433
00:50:20,709 --> 00:50:24,560
and it's people like you who make me
wanna get out of the hospital ...

434
00:50:24,984 --> 00:50:27,519
How can anyone listen to this crap?

435
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:31,545
... for her recent divorce, shot
her three children, aged seven ...

436
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:34,216
A judge

437
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:37,526
praised defendant John Roy,
but was dismayed to learn

438
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:40,341
that he'd had sex with the corpse.

439
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:42,042
What?

440
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:46,455
State authorities, last October
released 500 turtles ino the Ganges,

441
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:49,204
to try and reduce human pollution,

442
00:50:49,627 --> 00:50:52,684
and will now use crocodiles to eat
corpses dumped by poor Hindus ...

443
00:50:53,102 --> 00:50:57,960
Holy shit!
It's Night of the Living Dead!

444
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:02,269
What's that, Peanut?
- I can't take any more of this radio!

445
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:05,540
I've never heard
so much shit in all my life!

446
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:10,336
Sailor Ripley, you get me
some music now! I mean it!

447
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:13,462
... victim of a sexual assault ...
... mutilated ... raped ...

448
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,945
Johnnie, I can't tell you now,
honey, but listen:

449
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:44,559
Is there any way, any way
that we could get on the road tonight?

450
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:50,332
Something was upsetting you bad
last night when you called.

451
00:52:50,757 --> 00:52:53,080
And you wanted to tell me.

452
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:57,175
So I figured that you
wanted me to help you.

453
00:52:58,472 --> 00:52:59,752
I did.

454
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:04,028
Oh, I did.
But that was last night.

455
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:08,374
Now I need your help. We have to
find Lula before it's too late.

456
00:53:09,108 --> 00:53:12,201
Honey, I have to ask you something.
- Okay.

457
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:16,711
Is Santos
involved in this in any way?

458
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:21,652
Hell no!

459
00:53:22,629 --> 00:53:26,409
Do you think I would do something
like that without coming to you?

460
00:53:28,189 --> 00:53:29,955
I'm sorry, honey.

461
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:36,243
Goddamned Pucinski, son of a bitch!
- Who, Uncle Pooch?

462
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:40,143
The son of a bitch who introduced
Santos to you and Clyde.

463
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,436
Johnnie ...

464
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,599
That's all the past.

465
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:50,217
Now what you and I have to do ...

466
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:53,695
is think about our future.

467
00:53:55,474 --> 00:53:56,718
Do you mean that?

468
00:53:58,811 --> 00:54:01,405
You bet your sweet ass I do!

469
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:04,228
Gosh.

470
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:08,536
Did I tell you
how great it was to see you again?

471
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,954
Just about five times, that's all.

472
00:54:21,404 --> 00:54:24,734
Oh God, Johnnie, I love you!
- I love you too.

473
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:30,431
Let's get our backsides
out of this town and go get my Lula!

474
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:00,956
What's troublin' you, sugar?

475
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,792
You know, Lula ...

476
00:55:07,214 --> 00:55:10,366
I never told you what all
I was doing before I met you.

477
00:55:10,794 --> 00:55:15,581
I just figured
you were out being Mr. Cool.

478
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:17,915
Not exactly, sugar.

479
00:55:18,336 --> 00:55:24,582
One reason we're in this trouble
is because of what I was doing.

480
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,439
I tried to tell you this before.

481
00:55:28,312 --> 00:55:30,563
You're scaring me, baby.

482
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:34,563
Well, there's a good side
as well as a bad side to it.

483
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:39,356
The good side is that I knew
your daddy. Clyde was a good guy.

484
00:55:39,782 --> 00:55:42,768
You knew my daddy?
- Yes.

485
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:45,579
I sure did.

486
00:55:46,733 --> 00:55:48,285
The bad side of it ...

487
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:51,802
is I did some driving
for a man named Marcello Santos.

488
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:53,883
Oh Shit.

489
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:56,839
I quit working for him,

490
00:55:57,264 --> 00:56:00,357
but just before I did,
I ended up one night at a house.

491
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,576
I didn't know it then,

492
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,074
but it was your house.

493
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:09,111
I don't know
what they think I saw that night.

494
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,970
I was just sitting out in the car,
'til the whole place went up in flames.

495
00:56:15,895 --> 00:56:20,268
Oh God, Sailor,
that's the night my daddy died!

496
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,181
I know, sugar.

497
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:30,797
Daddy?

498
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,609
That's ...

499
00:56:37,652 --> 00:56:41,752
some big secret
you've been carrying, Sail'.

500
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,118
We all got
a secret side, baby.

501
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:49,842
I hope you don't think
I been lyin' to you about other things.

502
00:57:19,257 --> 00:57:21,473
Lula, you there?

503
00:57:23,046 --> 00:57:24,776
Yeah, I'm here ...

504
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:31,172
You upset with me?

505
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,587
It just shocking sometimes ...

506
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:40,004
when things aren't
what you thought they were.

507
00:57:53,945 --> 00:57:56,682
We're really
in the middle of it now, ain't we?

508
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:27,415
I'm gonna pack real fast,
then I'll meet you downstairs.

509
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:31,933
My God, what we could've done
on that kingsize bed tonight!

510
00:58:32,352 --> 00:58:36,132
Don't worry, I'll make up for it!
- Alright.

511
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:43,362
See you in a minute.
- Okay.

512
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:46,704
Marietta ...

513
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:25,001
What's that?

514
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:29,416
I don't know ...
Looks like clothes.

515
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:52,638
Oh God, Sailor!

516
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:55,133
One bad car accident.

517
01:00:37,582 --> 01:00:38,685
What should we do?

518
01:00:39,112 --> 01:00:41,814
I don't know, but we got to
help that girl, get her to a town,

519
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,747
and hope nobody finds out
that I broke parole.

520
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:50,641
This bobby pin ...

521
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:54,502
I can't find it.

522
01:00:54,926 --> 01:00:57,770
My mother's gonna kill me ...
... it's got all my cards ...

523
01:00:58,194 --> 01:00:59,438
It was in my pocket.

524
01:00:59,862 --> 01:01:03,157
Now my pocket's gone.
Gotta help me find it ...

525
01:01:04,415 --> 01:01:09,582
All my cards ...
and it was in my pocket, and ...

526
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,889
My purse is gone!
Now she tells me!

527
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:20,392
Let's get a hold of her!
- Is she going to make it?

528
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:23,391
Don't know, but she's gonna
bleed all over our car!

529
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,477
Hey ... hello! Girl!

530
01:01:27,529 --> 01:01:29,472
Come with us, honey!

531
01:01:29,893 --> 01:01:31,623
Leave me alone!

532
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,710
Robert?

533
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:41,214
Robert!

534
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:46,706
Shit.

535
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:50,772
Got this damned
sticky stuff in my hair ...

536
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:56,374
... got sticky stuff in my hair.

537
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:59,010
Better come with us, honey. Come on!

538
01:01:59,437 --> 01:02:02,979
Gotta find my wallet ...
Don't tell my mother, please.

539
01:02:03,399 --> 01:02:04,951
God, she's gonna kill me!

540
01:02:05,379 --> 01:02:07,453
Can't worry about that ...

541
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:13,371
Where's my hairbrush?
- God, she's dying right in front of us.

542
01:02:21,994 --> 01:02:24,281
Get my lipstick ...

543
01:02:26,373 --> 01:02:28,483
It's in my purse.

544
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:33,908
She died
right in front of us, Sailor ...

545
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:36,512
Why'd she have to go and do that?

546
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:41,383
Let's get outta here, honey.

547
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:56,158
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

548
01:03:52,571 --> 01:03:55,558
I don't understand this one tiny bit.

549
01:03:55,978 --> 01:04:00,137
See, he told me to wait
for him here in that lobby there.

550
01:04:00,566 --> 01:04:06,125
What I feel is that something
terrible has happened to him.

551
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:11,018
Perhaps we should
call a local law enforcement officer?

552
01:04:11,445 --> 01:04:13,387
No, please! Please no!

553
01:04:13,774 --> 01:04:17,838
The last thing I need
is some damned policeman

554
01:04:18,257 --> 01:04:19,987
moving and going around here ...

555
01:04:20,412 --> 01:04:24,086
No, I just can't ...
no ... no.

556
01:04:26,147 --> 01:04:29,513
I am sorry ...
I must have overlooked this.

557
01:04:29,936 --> 01:04:32,673
I'm truly
sorry, ma'am.

558
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:47,446
What?

559
01:04:50,617 --> 01:04:52,039
Could you ...?

560
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:57,487
"Gone fishing with a friend ...

561
01:04:58,785 --> 01:05:02,364
and maybe buffalo hunting, too."

562
01:05:02,852 --> 01:05:04,273
Buffalo hunting?

563
01:05:05,076 --> 01:05:06,806
"I've gone buffalo hunting."?

564
01:05:08,586 --> 01:05:12,366
What the fuck
does "Buffalo hunting" mean?

565
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,637
Well, I am sure
I wouldn't know, I mean ...

566
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:18,002
My God ...

567
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,778
He's afraid.

568
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,986
He's done it again!

569
01:05:25,409 --> 01:05:26,866
The fucker split!

570
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:31,654
"I've made a commitment."

571
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,390
Marietta!

572
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:36,491
Santos!

573
01:05:37,018 --> 01:05:40,597
Gentlemen, I'd like
to take this opportunity to ask you:

574
01:05:41,293 --> 01:05:44,765
Please, clear out!
- How rude!

575
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:47,896
Me too?
- Yeah, you too.

576
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:04,575
What did you do to Johnnie?
Where's Johnnie?

577
01:06:05,623 --> 01:06:06,867
What's happening here?

578
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:11,391
Tell me what's happening here!
Santos, tell me!

579
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:13,611
You been crying?

580
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:18,586
You gotta cut out
this crybaby stuff, you know?

581
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,683
You're my girl now, and Santos ...

582
01:06:23,732 --> 01:06:25,046
Santos ...

583
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:29,951
Santos wants to wipe away the tears,

584
01:06:31,761 --> 01:06:33,527
and make you happy.

585
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:38,324
I want you to tell me ...

586
01:06:38,955 --> 01:06:41,100
I want you to tell me ...

587
01:06:41,528 --> 01:06:45,165
Did you do anything to Johnnie?
Did you hurt him? I want to know.

588
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:49,579
I did not do anything
to Johnnie Farragut.

589
01:06:50,634 --> 01:06:53,099
You swear, on your mother?

590
01:06:54,145 --> 01:06:59,382
I swear. On my mother.
- God! Oh God!

591
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:01,397
Come on. We have to go.

592
01:07:01,826 --> 01:07:04,006
I got word:

593
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:05,984
The kids are moving through Texas.

594
01:07:06,414 --> 01:07:10,194
And I think a happy end
is being arranged there.

595
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:13,745
That's it, give me a smile!

596
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,907
Oh Santos.

597
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,652
You're the only one

598
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,606
that always came through for me.

599
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,886
I smell your shit now, Johnnie.
Give us one more kiss, Reggie!

600
01:07:46,802 --> 01:07:48,354
Oh, fuck me!

601
01:07:50,972 --> 01:07:52,287
Fuck me!

602
01:07:53,232 --> 01:07:54,511
Fuck me!

603
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:16,718
We hunt buffalo now.

604
01:08:17,145 --> 01:08:19,052
Can't wait no more!

605
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:31,667
Remember the number ... ten!

606
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:35,769
I can't stop her, Johnnie.

607
01:08:36,714 --> 01:08:42,059
But I gonna be standing behind you
with this big old gun!

608
01:08:44,986 --> 01:08:46,965
It's a Marine issue!

609
01:08:54,683 --> 01:08:56,211
I go out now ...

610
01:09:01,913 --> 01:09:03,299
Reggie!
- Yes?

611
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:06,214
Show him now!

612
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,337
Honey ...

613
01:09:15,016 --> 01:09:16,782
I forget to show you this!

614
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,280
Santos?

615
01:09:20,716 --> 01:09:23,075
Oh God, Marietta, honey ...

616
01:09:46,054 --> 01:09:47,547
One ...

617
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:50,466
Bye now!
- two ...

618
01:09:51,512 --> 01:09:53,727
three ... four ...

619
01:09:54,153 --> 01:09:56,369
Gettin' too hot now, Reggie!

620
01:09:56,795 --> 01:09:58,490
five ...

621
01:09:58,915 --> 01:10:00,159
... feeling myself ...

622
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:01,903
six ...

623
01:10:03,434 --> 01:10:04,464
seven ...

624
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:05,923
eight ...

625
01:10:06,562 --> 01:10:07,592
nine ...

626
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,835
Fuck me now, Reggie!

627
01:10:11,566 --> 01:10:12,596
ten!

628
01:10:32,873 --> 01:10:35,787
Why in the hell d'you want
to come to Big Tuna, Sail'?

629
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:39,159
I know
it's not exactly Emerald City ...

630
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:41,900
Not as bad as the weather, ...

631
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:46,314
'though it's a long way
off that road to California.

632
01:10:47,888 --> 01:10:51,005
Why in the hell d'you want
to come here, baby?

633
01:11:22,263 --> 01:11:23,921
Oh, look at this!

634
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:28,970
What do you want, Mr. Snakeskin?

635
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:32,087
I was hoping you could tell me
if there's a contract out on me.

636
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:35,050
I really need to know.
- By who?

637
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:38,100
Santos. Or Marietta Fortune.

638
01:11:39,433 --> 01:11:41,827
I heard you were going
with that bitch's daughter.

639
01:11:42,248 --> 01:11:47,391
You heard right.
- You are one big, stupid asshole.

640
01:11:49,721 --> 01:11:53,158
Don't you know that her mami and
Santos killed her daddy?

641
01:11:55,734 --> 01:11:59,313
So maybe one night
you got too close to a fire ...

642
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:01,781
So maybe you're gonna burn.

643
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,062
I didn't see nothin'.
- Sure. I did.

644
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,471
Santos!

645
01:12:38,277 --> 01:12:39,900
Is there a contract?

646
01:12:40,328 --> 01:12:43,966
We had a deal once:
We'd tip each other off if we heard.

647
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:49,114
I know. I remember.

648
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:50,850
Well?

649
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:56,803
I heard of nothing.

650
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:02,569
Thanks.

651
01:13:42,266 --> 01:13:44,695
Sail', honey, is that you?

652
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:46,644
The one and only!

653
01:13:47,966 --> 01:13:51,508
D'you get that oil, baby?
- Yes siree!

654
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,038
I met a guy called Red.
He owns a garage.

655
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:02,450
What's that smell?

656
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,378
I barfed.

657
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:11,458
I tried to make it to the bathroom,
but it was the wrong door.

658
01:14:12,505 --> 01:14:16,807
I think all this driving
is upsetting me, baby.

659
01:14:17,544 --> 01:14:19,795
D'you think we could stay here
and rest a couple of days?

660
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,199
Are you
carsick, sweetheart?

661
01:14:24,496 --> 01:14:26,191
A little, I guess.

662
01:14:40,971 --> 01:14:42,665
Oh Sailor, honey:

663
01:14:44,655 --> 01:14:49,929
I hope seeing that girl die
didn't jinx us.

664
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:03,907
I got this for you.

665
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,384
It has 40 different flavors.

666
01:15:09,055 --> 01:15:11,722
One for about every reason
I love you.

667
01:15:13,921 --> 01:15:16,207
Sail', I'm gonna save this.

668
01:15:18,544 --> 01:15:20,653
But if I ever eat it,

669
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:23,546
I'll be thinking of you.

670
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:45,998
"Robert Brenton
and two passengers, William Reese

671
01:15:46,523 --> 01:15:52,461
and Julie Day, were killed
when his car crashed on Highway 118."

672
01:15:52,884 --> 01:15:55,170
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck!

673
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,998
That stupid shit was so dumb,
he deserved to die!

674
01:16:00,391 --> 01:16:02,122
That asshole!

675
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:09,107
Timmy, what's going on in No. 4,
where them lights are always on?

676
01:16:13,564 --> 01:16:16,859
Them are making
a pornographic movie, Texas style!

677
01:16:17,493 --> 01:16:19,080
You wanna join in?

678
01:16:23,297 --> 01:16:28,084
To survive in Big Tuna, you
need an active sense of humor!

679
01:16:39,737 --> 01:16:44,702
This is Bosis Spool.
We call him "OO Spool".

680
01:16:45,124 --> 01:16:46,546
The man is a rocket scientist!

681
01:16:52,145 --> 01:16:56,624
My dog barks some.

682
01:17:05,318 --> 01:17:09,727
Mentally, you picture my dog,

683
01:17:11,018 --> 01:17:13,033
but, I have not told you

684
01:17:13,452 --> 01:17:17,682
the type of dog which I have.

685
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:24,249
Perhaps
you might even picture Toto

686
01:17:24,678 --> 01:17:27,380
from the "Wizard of Oz".

687
01:17:32,707 --> 01:17:39,059
But I can tell you
my dog is always with me.

688
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:17,012
Hey everybody!

689
01:18:18,066 --> 01:18:19,832
Bobby!
Hey, Sailor, Lula,

690
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:24,385
This is the man himself!
Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula,

691
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,025
the 2 most recent strandees,

692
01:18:27,519 --> 01:18:29,178
of the economic variety.

693
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:33,628
Bobby Peru. Like the country.

694
01:18:34,262 --> 01:18:36,691
Bobby just rolled into town
a few days ago.

695
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:39,400
Yeah, Bobby is
the most exciting item

696
01:18:39,824 --> 01:18:42,182
to hit Big Tuna
since the '86 cyclone

697
01:18:42,604 --> 01:18:44,678
sheared
the roof off the high school.

698
01:18:45,107 --> 01:18:48,994
You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

699
01:18:51,328 --> 01:18:53,378
I'm from all over.

700
01:18:56,785 --> 01:18:58,444
You were in the Marines.

701
01:19:03,181 --> 01:19:04,769
Four years.

702
01:19:05,475 --> 01:19:08,982
Bobby was at Cao Ben.
- What's Cao Ben?

703
01:19:10,897 --> 01:19:14,333
How old are you?
- Twenty.

704
01:19:21,776 --> 01:19:25,971
A lot of women and kids
and old people died at Cao Ben.

705
01:19:30,535 --> 01:19:32,063
You was on a ship, partner.

706
01:19:33,211 --> 01:19:35,534
Pretty hard to make contact
with the people,

707
01:19:35,957 --> 01:19:39,215
when you're out
floating in the Golf of Tonkin.

708
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:43,561
Come on Bobby,
have another glass of Jack.

709
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,211
Don't mind
if I fuckin' do.

710
01:20:01,608 --> 01:20:03,338
Speakin' of Jack ...

711
01:20:06,127 --> 01:20:11,613
One-eyed Jack's yearning to go
peeping in a seafood store ...

712
01:20:17,909 --> 01:20:19,260
Alright.

713
01:20:22,358 --> 01:20:24,301
Nice meetin' you.

714
01:20:29,483 --> 01:20:31,877
Adios, boys!
- See ya, Bobby!

715
01:20:33,828 --> 01:20:35,736
Bobby's got a way ...

716
01:20:36,609 --> 01:20:39,144
Can't shake
that institution out of him.

717
01:20:42,726 --> 01:20:47,277
Baby, I still ain't feelin' so well.
I'm goin' to bed.

718
01:20:47,696 --> 01:20:50,611
Will you come with me?
- Yeah, I'll come along.

719
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:54,397
Well ...

720
01:20:55,864 --> 01:20:58,364
- Good night!
- Good night!

721
01:21:23,739 --> 01:21:26,098
Lordy, what was that about?

722
01:21:27,494 --> 01:21:29,152
I don't know ...

723
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:49,558
Man, that barf smell
don't fade fast.

724
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:52,307
Is there anything I can do for you?

725
01:21:54,082 --> 01:21:56,227
I don't think so, Sail'.

726
01:21:57,142 --> 01:21:59,465
I just need to lie down.

727
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:34,876
You know what?

728
01:22:36,279 --> 01:22:38,424
I know you ain't
too pleased being here.

729
01:22:44,064 --> 01:22:45,592
It's not that.

730
01:22:53,727 --> 01:22:55,422
I'm gonna write it down,

731
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:59,349
because I can't say it.

732
01:23:01,547 --> 01:23:03,277
You can't say it?

733
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,944
I can't say this, not out loud.

734
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:21,635
I'M PREGNANT.

735
01:23:28,553 --> 01:23:30,082
Oh God!

736
01:23:37,486 --> 01:23:39,393
It's okay by me, Peanut.

737
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:44,672
Well, nothing personal ...

738
01:23:45,098 --> 01:23:47,421
But I ain't so sure
it's okay by me.

739
01:23:50,172 --> 01:23:53,609
Really, Sail',
it's nothing against you, baby.

740
01:23:54,656 --> 01:23:56,007
I love you.

741
01:23:58,236 --> 01:23:59,729
I love you too.

742
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:02,091
I know.

743
01:24:06,091 --> 01:24:10,156
I'm just sort of uncomfortable
about how things are going,

744
01:24:11,618 --> 01:24:16,204
since we broke down
along that Yellow Brick Road,

745
01:24:16,623 --> 01:24:20,202
and this doesn't soothe me.

746
01:24:23,053 --> 01:24:26,205
Honey, I promise I ain't gonna let
things get no worse.

747
01:24:32,507 --> 01:24:34,557
Not in a million years.

748
01:25:12,895 --> 01:25:14,732
Hey, pretty woman. Is Sailor here?

749
01:25:15,155 --> 01:25:18,591
No, he's changing oil out in our car.
- I gotta take a piss, bad,

750
01:25:19,012 --> 01:25:21,263
can I use your head?

751
01:25:22,314 --> 01:25:23,523
Oh ... yeah, I guess.

752
01:25:24,365 --> 01:25:27,696
I don't mean your head head ...
I'm not goin' to piss on your hair,

753
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:30,405
just gonna piss in the toilet.

754
01:25:31,178 --> 01:25:36,416
Ya'll take a listen, you'll hear
a deep sound comin' from Bobby Peru!

755
01:25:54,222 --> 01:25:57,480
There's a smell in this room of puke.

756
01:25:58,531 --> 01:26:00,474
Have you been puking?

757
01:26:03,433 --> 01:26:04,985
Are you sick?

758
01:26:06,387 --> 01:26:09,231
Pregnant?
- You used the toilet, now go!

759
01:26:09,655 --> 01:26:12,190
It ain't none of your business
what I do around here!

760
01:26:12,677 --> 01:26:15,900
I sure do like a woman
with nice tits like yours,

761
01:26:16,293 --> 01:26:20,488
who talks tough and looks like
she can fuck like a bunny.

762
01:26:20,915 --> 01:26:22,337
Can you fuck like that?

763
01:26:23,835 --> 01:26:26,264
You like it like a bunny?

764
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:31,574
'Cause if you do, baby,
I'll fuck you good,

765
01:26:32,003 --> 01:26:35,605
like a big old jack-rabbit,
jump all around that hole!

766
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,433
Bobby Peru don't come up for air!

767
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,628
Get out!

768
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:45,555
Am I scarin' you?

769
01:26:48,339 --> 01:26:49,962
Is your pussy wet?

770
01:26:52,093 --> 01:26:53,716
Is it wet?

771
01:26:56,577 --> 01:26:58,484
Oh, don't jump back so slow.

772
01:26:58,905 --> 01:27:02,484
I thought you was a bunny!
Bunnies jump fast.

773
01:27:03,389 --> 01:27:05,569
You jump back slow.

774
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,810
Means something, don't it?

775
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:12,449
Means something to me.

776
01:27:13,503 --> 01:27:15,897
Means you want Bobby Peru.

777
01:27:16,562 --> 01:27:19,476
You want Bobby Peru
to fuck you hard, baby,

778
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:22,258
to open you
like a Christmas present!

779
01:27:23,478 --> 01:27:29,037
You want me to do it?
Just a simple "yes" or "no".

780
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:31,921
Just feel me breathin' on ya.

781
01:27:32,967 --> 01:27:37,684
And you know I mean business
when it comes to fuckin' ! - Out!

782
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,034
Bobby Peru will grab ya ...

783
01:27:43,082 --> 01:27:44,954
hold ya tight ...

784
01:27:45,376 --> 01:27:47,283
feel everythin' in ya.

785
01:27:47,739 --> 01:27:49,362
Be quiet!

786
01:27:50,207 --> 01:27:51,664
Say "Fuck me".

787
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:54,443
Then I'll leave.
- No way. Get out!

788
01:27:55,178 --> 01:27:59,172
Say it! I'll tear your
fuckin' heart out, girl!

789
01:28:00,217 --> 01:28:01,461
Say "Fuck me".

790
01:28:01,885 --> 01:28:03,543
Say "Fuck me"!

791
01:28:04,006 --> 01:28:06,957
Then I'll go. Say "Fuck me"!

792
01:28:07,377 --> 01:28:09,451
Whisper it. Say it!

793
01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:12,589
Say it. Say it!

794
01:28:14,051 --> 01:28:15,709
Say "Fuck me".

795
01:28:16,449 --> 01:28:18,523
Whisper it. "Fuck me".

796
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:23,223
"Fuck me". Say "Fuck me".

797
01:29:01,912 --> 01:29:04,720
Some day honey, I will!
But I gotta get goin' !

798
01:29:09,245 --> 01:29:11,840
Sing! Don't cry ...

799
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,413
Hi Bobby!

800
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:13,164
You need a hand?
- Thanks, but I'm about done.

801
01:30:14,971 --> 01:30:16,393
How about a beer?

802
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:19,549
A beer ...

803
01:30:20,985 --> 01:30:22,264
Well, ...

804
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:25,737
Yeah, Bobby, that'd be fine.

805
01:30:29,187 --> 01:30:31,332
Where is your
pretty little lady today?

806
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:38,594
She's up in our room, restin'.
Hasn't been feelin' well lately.

807
01:30:39,614 --> 01:30:41,664
Sorry to hear it.

808
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:29,380
I've been studying
a situation over in Lobo.

809
01:31:29,805 --> 01:31:32,091
Take two men to handle it.

810
01:31:36,582 --> 01:31:38,454
What's that?

811
01:31:38,877 --> 01:31:42,384
A feed store,
keeps up to 5 K in their safe.

812
01:31:42,804 --> 01:31:45,991
Need me a good boy
for backup. Even split.

813
01:31:47,044 --> 01:31:48,775
Interested?

814
01:31:50,033 --> 01:31:51,763
No, man.

815
01:31:55,038 --> 01:31:56,661
I don't think so.

816
01:31:58,306 --> 01:32:00,321
It'll be easy, Sailor.

817
01:32:00,738 --> 01:32:07,020
Two employees. I take 'em in back
to open the safe. You cover the door.

818
01:32:14,085 --> 01:32:15,922
You ain't plannin' on raisin'

819
01:32:16,935 --> 01:32:19,744
a family in the Big Tuna, are you?

820
01:32:21,628 --> 01:32:24,093
Wait a minute ...

821
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:27,081
Whad'ya mean by family?

822
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:29,584
Well, I mean ...

823
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:32,263
with Lula ...

824
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:37,475
being in a family way and all.

825
01:32:40,049 --> 01:32:42,716
Did Lula tell you
she was pregnant?

826
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,371
Couple of grand or two
sure would help you two out.

827
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:52,279
Get you out West, to Mexico, or
anywhere with a few dollars to spare.

828
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,987
I've got it figured out good.

829
01:32:56,176 --> 01:32:59,364
When did you talk to Lula?

830
01:33:01,981 --> 01:33:04,576
I talked to her
this afternoon,

831
01:33:08,029 --> 01:33:09,759
when you was out.

832
01:33:16,232 --> 01:33:20,190
Did she really say
she was pregnant?

833
01:33:22,766 --> 01:33:25,539
I just took a guess, that's all.

834
01:33:27,006 --> 01:33:29,151
You in or out on this deal?

835
01:33:33,054 --> 01:33:35,448
I ain't fucking sure, Bobby.

836
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,312
Don't take too long to think about it.

837
01:33:52,692 --> 01:33:54,078
Had enough?

838
01:33:56,064 --> 01:33:57,616
Have now!

839
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:03,248
Let's go outside.
I have something to show you.

840
01:34:06,595 --> 01:34:09,403
Right here
is a double-barreled, sawed-off

841
01:34:09,827 --> 01:34:11,450
Ithica shotgun.

842
01:34:12,921 --> 01:34:14,165
Next to it:

843
01:34:14,589 --> 01:34:20,384
a Smith & Wesson .38 handgun
with a 4-inch barrel.

844
01:34:30,716 --> 01:34:32,411
Those'll do her,

845
01:34:32,837 --> 01:34:35,195
really loosen up that 5 grand.

846
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:38,667
Two and a half
for you and the little lady.

847
01:34:40,379 --> 01:34:42,914
How much money you got left?

848
01:34:44,828 --> 01:34:46,664
Forty bucks ...

849
01:34:47,191 --> 01:34:49,372
This is easy money, partner.

850
01:34:49,799 --> 01:34:52,228
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

851
01:34:53,274 --> 01:34:55,976
And I don't think
you can afford to pass it up ...

852
01:34:58,661 --> 01:35:02,821
I'll bring the Eldorado to
the back of the motel at 10 AM.

853
01:35:04,814 --> 01:35:08,072
Really could
set you and that little lady up good.

854
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:13,528
Yeah, I guess so.

855
01:35:14,546 --> 01:35:16,241
That kinda money

856
01:35:17,256 --> 01:35:21,771
will get us a long way down
that Yellow Brick Road.

857
01:35:23,757 --> 01:35:27,537
But damn it, this better go real smooth,
you understand me?

858
01:35:27,962 --> 01:35:31,220
Like taking candy from a baby.

859
01:35:43,012 --> 01:35:44,564
Here comes Sailor.

860
01:36:18,152 --> 01:36:20,167
You've been drinkin', huh?

861
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:22,941
A few beers is all.

862
01:36:25,381 --> 01:36:26,933
Feelin' any better?

863
01:36:27,641 --> 01:36:29,583
Can't tell yet.

864
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:38,511
That smell's still filling this room good.

865
01:36:44,533 --> 01:36:46,583
So where d'you say you was?

866
01:36:51,101 --> 01:36:53,317
I went with Bobby.

867
01:37:00,035 --> 01:37:01,314
Sail'?

868
01:37:04,553 --> 01:37:05,904
Let's leave here.

869
01:37:06,569 --> 01:37:07,636
We are, Peanut.

870
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:13,304
Real soon.

871
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:30,610
You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru?

872
01:37:32,463 --> 01:37:34,537
What could I be up to?

873
01:37:46,818 --> 01:37:50,397
That Bobby Peru
is a black angel, Sail'.

874
01:37:52,309 --> 01:37:55,224
You hook up
with him and you'll regret it ...

875
01:37:56,028 --> 01:37:57,936
If you live to.

876
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,470
Thanks, darling.

877
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:04,993
I know
you got my interests in mind,

878
01:38:05,413 --> 01:38:07,736
and I appreciate it sincerely.

879
01:38:08,785 --> 01:38:11,415
I love you, but
I got to get some sleep now.

880
01:38:13,442 --> 01:38:18,680
This whole world is wild at heart ...
and weird on top.

881
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:30,847
I wish you'd sing me
"Love me tender".

882
01:38:32,802 --> 01:38:36,309
Oh, I wish
I was somewhere over that rainbow.

883
01:38:38,015 --> 01:38:39,508
It's just shit!

884
01:38:40,935 --> 01:38:43,080
Shit, shit, shit!

885
01:39:27,055 --> 01:39:29,034
The whole gang, huh?

886
01:39:29,453 --> 01:39:30,483
Yes.

887
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:38,103
You know, you look
a whole lot better in the flesh.

888
01:39:41,861 --> 01:39:44,326
The cobra
is waitin' to strike, Chica.

889
01:39:45,268 --> 01:39:47,140
You know that guy, Sailor?

890
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:49,706
He came by the other afternoon.

891
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:53,639
He wanted to know if there was
a contract on him. - No shit?

892
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:57,360
You know him?
- I used to.

893
01:39:57,815 --> 01:40:00,588
What did you say?
- "No", of course.

894
01:40:01,187 --> 01:40:02,881
That's right.

895
01:40:04,593 --> 01:40:07,745
He could have
a bad accident, though.

896
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:13,521
Before,

897
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:16,051
during or after a hold-up.

898
01:40:27,637 --> 01:40:29,509
What am I doing here?

899
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:38,930
Sailor, what are you doing here?

900
01:40:43,069 --> 01:40:44,622
I can't do this.

901
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:57,869
Climb in back!

902
01:40:59,683 --> 01:41:01,306
What the hell's she doin' here?

903
01:41:01,733 --> 01:41:05,692
She's my girl.
She's drivin'. That bother you?

904
01:41:06,114 --> 01:41:07,286
Jump in!

905
01:41:07,711 --> 01:41:09,026
You owe me one.

906
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:11,701
Come on, Mr. Big Round Balls,

907
01:41:13,099 --> 01:41:15,493
let's go
and make us some easy money.

908
01:41:21,754 --> 01:41:24,325
They say the eagle flies on Friday.

909
01:43:22,814 --> 01:43:24,793
Get that mask on!

910
01:43:25,734 --> 01:43:28,685
Keep it revvin', Chiquita.
We'll be right back!

911
01:43:29,175 --> 01:43:31,249
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Remember that!

912
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:33,925
Right, partner!

913
01:43:46,205 --> 01:43:47,793
Okay, boys!

914
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:51,208
Get in the back!
Get into the back! Now! Both of you!

915
01:43:54,026 --> 01:43:56,941
If anyone comes in,
herd 'em back here quick.

916
01:43:57,363 --> 01:44:00,100
Alright,
let's make this nice and easy!

917
01:44:25,308 --> 01:44:27,358
You waitin' for somebody?

918
01:44:27,776 --> 01:44:29,304
My husband.

919
01:44:31,912 --> 01:44:34,685
He's in the feed store.

920
01:44:38,829 --> 01:44:42,953
Well, watch that cigarette, ma'am.
It's about to burn down to your fingers.

921
01:44:43,382 --> 01:44:45,776
Thank you, officer.

922
01:44:46,997 --> 01:44:50,054
I haven't seen you before.
Are you from Lobo?

923
01:44:51,063 --> 01:44:52,094
No.

924
01:44:52,905 --> 01:44:54,493
Over here!

925
01:44:56,103 --> 01:44:57,690
Big Tuna, huh?

926
01:44:58,119 --> 01:45:00,713
That's quite a drive, isn't it?
- Yes.

927
01:45:01,177 --> 01:45:02,421
Let's go!

928
01:45:03,228 --> 01:45:04,295
Say "Cheese".

929
01:45:07,225 --> 01:45:08,504
Stay put!

930
01:45:13,968 --> 01:45:15,496
Cool it, man!

931
01:45:18,035 --> 01:45:19,587
You're next, fucker!

932
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:35,202
Those are dummies, dummy!

933
01:45:40,974 --> 01:45:43,439
Step up here, hotshot!

934
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:46,324
I'll slap
that smile right off your face!

935
01:46:06,696 --> 01:46:08,390
Stop, you sons of bitches!

936
01:46:09,858 --> 01:46:11,932
This is the police!
Hold it or I'll shoot!

937
01:46:25,951 --> 01:46:27,230
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

938
01:46:30,226 --> 01:46:32,027
That poor bastard.

939
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:35,605
Hands behind your head, cowboy!

940
01:46:38,602 --> 01:46:42,726
Lula, I really let you
down this time.

941
01:46:44,616 --> 01:46:45,967
Peanut!

942
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:48,432
Look for the damned thing!

943
01:46:48,855 --> 01:46:53,821
We'll find it,
they sew them things back on.

944
01:46:54,243 --> 01:46:55,795
Works good as new.

945
01:46:56,224 --> 01:46:58,298
I can't find it.
Where is the damned thing?

946
01:46:58,726 --> 01:47:00,421
It's gotta be here somewhere.

947
01:47:28,132 --> 01:47:31,734
Pardon me. I'm lookin' for 770378.

948
01:47:45,406 --> 01:47:47,065
Sailor, baby!

949
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:22,759
Oh my God! Oh my God!

950
01:48:23,187 --> 01:48:27,560
My baby, sweetest one. Oh, sweetheart.

951
01:48:27,984 --> 01:48:30,448
Mama's gonna take you home.
We're gonna go home.

952
01:48:30,868 --> 01:48:32,883
Santos is gonna help us.

953
01:48:33,302 --> 01:48:38,931
He's gonna take us
to the airport in San Antonio.

954
01:48:39,384 --> 01:48:42,157
It's OK, baby.
- No ... - Yes.

955
01:48:43,729 --> 01:48:45,495
Come!
We're gonna go.

956
01:48:45,918 --> 01:48:47,447
It's OK.
- Mama! - Yes?

957
01:48:47,865 --> 01:48:51,231
Sailor's in deep trouble here.
I can't just leave him.

958
01:48:51,654 --> 01:48:54,949
Oh yes, you can!

959
01:48:55,373 --> 01:48:58,110
Yes, you can!

960
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:05,722
Your mama was
real worried about you, honey.

961
01:49:06,773 --> 01:49:08,396
Me too.

962
01:49:10,909 --> 01:49:13,480
Can you
give your old friend Santos a hug?

963
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:26,197
Dearest Sailor,

964
01:49:26,863 --> 01:49:30,500
First thing you'll want to know is:
I'm keeping the baby.

965
01:49:30,895 --> 01:49:34,605
Mama wasn't for it at first,
but I think now she is.

966
01:49:35,031 --> 01:49:40,067
I'm gonna name it Pace,
no matter if it's a boy or a girl.

967
01:49:40,488 --> 01:49:45,725
It's kinda hard to believe that
Pace will be six when you get out.

968
01:49:46,154 --> 01:49:48,724
Our child!

969
01:49:49,142 --> 01:49:51,501
I love you, Sailor.

970
01:49:51,923 --> 01:49:54,459
I miss dancing
and talking,

971
01:49:54,878 --> 01:49:57,129
and especially the other!

972
01:50:06,522 --> 01:50:11,629
When ... does ... Sailor's train get in?

973
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:14,303
Six.

974
01:50:19,799 --> 01:50:22,713
If I asked you
not to go ...

975
01:50:23,205 --> 01:50:25,385
It wouldn't make any difference.

976
01:50:26,646 --> 01:50:30,153
Girl, what if I told you
not to go?

977
01:50:30,991 --> 01:50:34,286
Mama, if you get in the way
of our happiness,

978
01:50:34,709 --> 01:50:37,032
I'll fucking pull your
arms out by the roots!

979
01:50:56,955 --> 01:50:58,934
No!

980
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:08,902
Mama,
you almost crashed us!

981
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:12,904
Oh, an accident, baby!

982
01:51:20,902 --> 01:51:22,952
Oh no, oh man!

983
01:51:25,559 --> 01:51:28,189
Same fuckin' thing
happened to me last year!

984
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:28,741
You must be my son.

985
01:52:33,476 --> 01:52:35,762
Shake hands with your daddy, Pace.

986
01:52:40,705 --> 01:52:45,007
It's a pleasure to meet you, Pace.
I read a lot about you.

987
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:12,328
Are you hungry?

988
01:53:14,558 --> 01:53:16,466
Lead the way.

989
01:53:17,513 --> 01:53:18,970
No!

990
01:53:20,328 --> 01:53:21,643
No!

991
01:53:44,519 --> 01:53:46,498
What's wrong, Mama?

992
01:53:46,918 --> 01:53:49,312
Don't worry, son. Just stay here.

993
01:54:02,663 --> 01:54:05,128
I'm sorry, Sailor,
I just can't help it.

994
01:54:05,582 --> 01:54:09,291
Just give me one little minute,
then I'll quit.

995
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:13,155
The boy's frightened,
Lula. This ain't no good.

996
01:54:15,767 --> 01:54:18,125
Really, Sailor, I'll be okay.

997
01:54:25,011 --> 01:54:27,061
It's a mistake, honey.

998
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:30,880
You two go on.
I'll walk back to the depot.

999
01:54:32,206 --> 01:54:36,615
What are you talking about?
That's your son in there!

1000
01:54:37,038 --> 01:54:38,945
He never knew me, Lula.

1001
01:54:39,367 --> 01:54:41,239
So there's not
much for him to forget.

1002
01:54:41,661 --> 01:54:45,998
And 6 years apart
makes it almost simple for us too.

1003
01:54:47,778 --> 01:54:49,923
How can you say that, Sailor?

1004
01:54:51,879 --> 01:54:53,822
It's what makes sense.

1005
01:54:57,371 --> 01:54:59,386
Please don't do this, Sailor!

1006
01:55:01,959 --> 01:55:03,617
If ever something
doesn't feel right to you,

1007
01:55:04,044 --> 01:55:06,224
remember
what Pancho said to the Cisco Kid:

1008
01:55:07,242 --> 01:55:12,836
"Let's win, before we're dancing
at the end of a rope, without music."

1009
01:55:26,741 --> 01:55:29,312
You've been fine without me.

1010
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:33,688
No need to make life
tougher than it has to be.

1011
01:55:55,728 --> 01:55:57,944
Sailor, come back!

1012
01:57:06,217 --> 01:57:07,745
What do you faggots want?

1013
01:57:49,455 --> 01:57:50,734
The Good Witch ...

1014
01:57:53,591 --> 01:57:55,214
Lula loves you.

1015
01:57:56,024 --> 01:57:59,768
But I'm a robber
and a manslaughterer.

1016
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:02,589
And I haven't had
any parental guidance.

1017
01:58:03,010 --> 01:58:06,032
She's forgiven you all that.

1018
01:58:07,251 --> 01:58:10,758
You love her.

1019
01:58:11,178 --> 01:58:13,287
Don't be afraid, Sailor.

1020
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:17,527
But I'm wild at heart.

1021
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:20,693
If you are truly wild at heart,

1022
01:58:21,745 --> 01:58:24,138
you'll fight for your dreams.

1023
01:58:28,314 --> 01:58:31,228
Don't turn away from love, Sailor.

1024
01:58:33,110 --> 01:58:35,540
Don't turn away from love.

1025
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,737
Had enough, asshole?

1026
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,251
Yes I have.

1027
01:59:09,848 --> 01:59:12,029
And I want to
apologize to you gentlemen

1028
01:59:12,456 --> 01:59:14,779
for referring to you as homosexuals.

1029
01:59:15,202 --> 01:59:17,796
I also want to thank you fellows.

1030
01:59:18,226 --> 01:59:21,413
You've taught me
a valuable lesson in life.

1031
02:00:51,793 --> 02:00:53,988
I just met
the Good Witch.
