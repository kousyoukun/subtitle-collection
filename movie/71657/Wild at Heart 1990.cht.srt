SOMEWHERE ON THE BOROER
BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA

8
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,706
喂，賽勒，等等
Hey, Sailor, wait!

9
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:38,716
我有話對你說
I got something for you.

10
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:43,048
瑪麗葉塔告訴我
Marietta tells me you were trying to

11
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,627
- 你剛纔在廁所裡對她動手動腳 - 媽的   
 fuck her in the toilets. - Oh, man ...


12
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:49,891
你這個變態佬，連你馬子的老媽都想上
You crazy bad boy, trying to fuck your girl's mama!

13
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:55,437
你那小娘們對此會有何感想？
Tell me， how does that little cunt Lula feel about that?

14
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,405
知道嗎  
You know ...

15
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:02,142
瑪麗葉塔剛給我這個，讓我宰了你
Marietta gave me this to kill you.

16
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:04,142
然後還答應把那小婊子給我
And then she said I'd be able to fuck Lula ...

17

(匹迪懲教所)
PEE DEE PENITENTIARY

19
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:39,417


20
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:48,400
- 喂？   - 露拉在嗎？
Hello ...? - Is Lula there?

21
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,503
你是誰？
Who is this?

22
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,635
賽勒•瑞普利
Sailor Ripley.

23
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:56,868
我能跟露拉說話嗎？
Can I ... talk to Lula?

24
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:01,180
你休想
There's no way in hell!

25
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:06,246
- 你如果想見她，就是找死  - 什麼？   
  If you even think about seeing Lula, you're dead. - What?

26
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,622
我說得很明白，以後別再打電話來
You heard me. And don't you ever call here again!

27
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:24,342
媽媽
Mama?

28
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:28,439
你清楚剛纔是誰的電話
You know who that was.

29
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:31,952
你也清楚你不能見他
And you know you aren't,

30
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:35,817
我老實告訴你，從今往後
and I mean are not gonna see him ever.

31
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:38,325
不許你再見到他!
End of story!

32
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,796
去你的!
Like hell!

33
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,155
露拉
Lula!

34
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,132
- 賽勒!  - 我的小花生米
Sailor! - Peanut!

35
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:17,033
嗨，寶貝
Hey baby!

36
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:24,307
我給你準備了一個驚喜
I've got a surprise for you!

37
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:28,807
我的蛇皮夾克! 謝了，親愛的! 我有沒有告訴你
Hey, my snakeskin jacket! Thanks, baby! Did I ever tell you

38
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:34,219
這件夾克代表我對個人自由的信仰
that this jacket is a symbol of my
belief in personal freedom?

39
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,816
你講過9999次啦
About 50,000 times.

40
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:40,660
我在恐怖角訂了房，猜猜有什麼好事？
I got us a room at the Cape Fear. And guess what?

41
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:43,201
颶風酒吧裡來了瘋力樂隊
"Powermad" is at the "Hurricane"!

42
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:44,767
開車吧!
Stab it and steer!

43
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:30,451
老天，賽勒寶貝，你可真不簡單
Jeez Lou-eez, Sailor, you are something else ...

44
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:36,561
我15歲時，媽媽對我說我
When I was 15, my mama told me

45
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,632
很快我就會對性感興趣
that pretty soon I'd be starting to think about sex,

46
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:43,702
在我嘗試這種事之前，應該告訴她一聲
and that I should tell her before I did anything about it.

47
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,137
可我記得你說過你的"苟"叔叔
But I thought you told me your uncle Pooch

48
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,969
在你13歲那年強奸了你
raped you when you was 13?

49
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:52,177
是的
True.

50
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,975
"苟"叔叔不是我親叔叔
Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle.

51
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,941
他是我爸的生意伙伴
He was a business partner of my daddy's.

52
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:03,655
媽媽從來不知道我跟他的事
Mama never knew 'bout me and him ...

53
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:06,196
這是肯定的
that's for damn sure.

54
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,757
知道嗎？你是個蠢貨
You know what? You're a pumpkin.

55
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,675
天啊! 給我滾出去!
Oh, my God! Get out!

56
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,974
普奇叔叔3個月後死於車禍
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash 3 months later,

57
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,139
當時他在莫特爾海灘度假
on holiday in Myrtle Beach.

58
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,741
那地方車禍多得離奇
They still got way too much traffic there.

59
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,845
你有沒發現最近交通越來越擁擠？
Have you been noticin' the buildup in traffic?

60
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,788
又來了
Here she goes again.

61
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:02,226
對不起，賽勒
I'm sorry, Sailor,

62
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,327
可臭氧層正在慢慢消失
but that ozone layer is disappearin'.

63
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,729
總有一天早上，太陽升起來後
One of these mornings, the sun's gonna

64
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,830
就會像一束X光，把地球燒出個洞來
burn a hole clean through the earth like an electrical X-ray.

65
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,668
這種事是不會發生的，寶貝
That won't happen, honey.

66
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:18,674
起碼在咱們這輩子不會，要真到了那時
At least not in our lifetime.And by then,

67
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:20,939
大家會開著別克到月球去
they'll be driving Buicks to the moon.

68
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:34,761
你還好吧，親愛的？
You OK, honey?

69
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,904
那女人的笑聲讓我覺得好恐怖
That woman's laugh creeps me out.

70
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:43,504
我好像在哪聽過
Like something I've heard before.

71
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,308
像惡邪女巫在笑
Sounded like the Wicked Witch.

72
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,939
我倒覺得那隻是個開心的老太婆
Just sounded like an old gal having a good time to me.

73
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,485
準備好去跳舞了嗎？
You ready to go dancing?

74
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,283
我隨時都能去跳
I'm always ready to dance.

75
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:59,826
但要先親一個，一個就好
But I need my kiss first.Just one!

76
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:22,082
如果你不幫我阻止這件事，我就自己去請殺手
I'm gonna hire me a hit man, if you don't help me stop this thing.

77
00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:27,648
我要打電話找馬切羅•桑托斯
I'm going to call Marcello Santos.

78
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:34,767
瑪麗葉塔，我會幫你的
Marietta, I am gonna help you.

79
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:37,462
所以別做得傻事
So don't get carried away.

80
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,802
你不會真的想讓桑托斯一伙插手吧？
You don't want to bring Santos and his bunch into this.

81
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:45,538
你嫉妒他，因為他對我餘情未了
You're just jealous of him 'cause he's still sweet on me.

82
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:51,118
你還和他見面？
You been seeing him again?

83
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,587
我的天!
Oh my God,

84
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:55,817
我真不敢相信!
I don't believe this!

85
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:58,392
強尼•費拉加特
Johnnie Farragut ...

86
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:04,393
你竟然信不過你的瑪麗葉塔？
who doesn't even trust his very own Marietta?

87
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,640
好吧，對不起，親愛的
Alright, I'm sorry honey, but ...

88
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:13,579
我太愛你了
I just love you,

89
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:16,644
纔會心生妒忌
and it just brings out ...

90
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:21,187
老天! 我恨自己這麼善妒
That ugly jealous side, I hate it, God!

91
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,471
別用舌頭，我塗了唇膏
No tongue! My lipstick.

92
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:51,715
親愛的，不要再為我擔心
Sweetheart, I want you to stop worrying about me,

93
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:58,321
還是考慮怎麼把露拉那個殺人犯手裡救出來
and start worryin' about how to get Lula from that murderer.

94
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,025
慢著，親愛的
Honey, wait a minute now;

95
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,229
賽勒不是殺人犯
Sailor ain't no murderer.

96
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:07,068
聽我說，不要老對他有成見
Now listen to me! You gotta get off that kick.

97
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:12,240
據我所知，賽勒在被牽涉進
As far as I know, Sailor was all clean before he got involved in

98
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:14,543
和露拉有關的那件事之前，是清白的
in that event with Lula.

99
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:16,845
而且他當時想保護她
And even there, he was trying to protect her.

100
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,083
李蒙那個瘋子是帶著刀子襲擊他們的
That crazy Bob Ray Lemon was comin' at them with a knife.

101
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:24,215
他很可能會殺了他們倆，你該感謝他纔對
He could've killed both of them.You ought to be thankin' him!

102
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:26,385
我不知道自己干嘛對你說這些
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

103
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,694
你當時在場，這件該死的事你親眼見到
You were there,you saw the whole damned thing!

104
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,494
難道不是嗎？
Didn't you?

105
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:01,995
賽勒小子!
Sailor boy!

106
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:14,116
你想不想  
How'd you like

107
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,085
和露拉的媽媽玩玩？
to fuck Lula's mama?

108
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,189
不  伯母  
No ... ma'am ...

109
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,697
- 我敢肯定不想  - 可露拉的媽媽想和你玩
I sure don't. - Lula's mama would like to fuck you.

110
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:32,869
弗琴太太，我想你非常需要杯咖啡醒醒酒
Mrs. Fortune, I really think you need a cup of coffee.

111
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:37,400
也許我當時是在場
Maybe I was there.

112
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,479
可我什麼也沒看到!
But I didn't see anything at all.

113
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,244
我隻知道那個敗類  
All I know is,is that trash,

114
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:47,618
他空手活活打死了一個人
he killed a man with his bare hands,

115
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:53,117
那雙手很可能就在打我的壞主意
hands that are probably all over my baby right now!

116
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,597
親愛的，冷靜點
Oh, honey, settle down.

117
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:01,463
沒事了，別激動
It's all right, come on now.

118
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,240
沒事了
It's alright.

119
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:07,405
聽我說，我也希望露拉幸福
Now listen, I want what's best for her too.

120
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:11,904
我會盡我所能帶她回家，好嗎？
I'll do everything I can to bring her back home, OK?

121
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:34,910
寶貝，別折騰，我還有一個腳趾沒塗
Baby, quit bouncing.I got one more toe to do.

122
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,913
咱們去跳舞吧，小心肝
Let's go dancing, Peanut!

123
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,776
我已經整裝待發
I'm ready.

124
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:43,118
但我們最好小心點
But we better be careful.

125
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:47,657
媽媽肯定會叫強尼•費拉加特跟蹤我們
Mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut after us.

126
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:51,592
他可是個有頭腦的偵探，知道多有頭腦嗎？
He's one clever detective.You know how clever?

127
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,131
- 怎麼個有頭腦法？- 他有一次告訴我.
How clever?- He told me once,

128
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,156
他能在華盛頓找到一個誠實的人
he could find an honest man in Washington.

129
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:04,507
再等兩分鐘，指甲油馬上就干
I just want two more moments,then my toes will be dry.

130
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,906
- 有件事我一直想不透，寶貝 - 什麼事？                
One thing puzzles me, sugar.- What's that?

131
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:10,883
你己經20歲了
You're 20 years old.

132
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,783
難道沒想過為什麼你媽不讓我們在一起？
Ain't you ever curious as to why your mama wants to keep us apart ?

133
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,825
我告訴你好了，露拉
I'll tell you, Lula ...

134
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:27,736
不光是因為我殺了李蒙
it's more than me killing Bob Ray Lemon.

135
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,942
也許是我媽關心我有點過了頭
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much.

136
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:36,712
對，也許是
Yeah, maybe.

137
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:43,688
我隻是想給你一個告別之吻
I just want to kiss you goodbye.

138
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,747
因為你對露拉媽媽的底細知道太多
You know too much about Lula's Mama.

139
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:49,760
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

140
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:55,165
強尼告訴我，你曾經給桑托斯當過司機
Johnnie told me you were a driver for Marcello Santos.

141
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:58,864
- 那又怎麼樣？ - 說不定某天夜裡
So what? - So maybe one night,

142
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,137
你離火太近
you got too close to a fire.

143
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:08,109
所以你惹火上身，此外，你這狗屎  
So maybe you're gonna burn.Besides, you're shit.

144
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,382
你以為我會讓我的寶貝女兒
You think I'd let my little girl

145
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:14,151
和你這種敗類在一起鬼混？
hang out with a piece of s-h-i-t like you?

146
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:18,924
臭小子，你還是老實待在糞坑裡
Kid, you belong in one of these toilets!

147
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:25,937
你這個惡心的白種母狗
You piece of white trash!

148
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,463
你  
You ...

149
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:37,348
除非把我殺了，不然休想讓我離開露拉
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.

150
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,379
這事犯不著你操心，我會先把你那話兒切下來
Don't worry about that.First I'm gonna cut your balls off

151
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,482
再叫你自個兒咽下去
and feed them to you.

152
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,699
除非你把我殺了
You're gonna have to kill me.

153
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,668
放心，一切有我安排
I can arrange that.

154
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,443
我想這問題沒法很快解決
It's a problem I don't think is gonna go away too soon.

155
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,809
我準備違反保釋條例，帶你到加州享受燦爛陽光
I'm ready to break parole and take you out to sunny California!

156
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,285
- 賽勒!     - 你開心嗎？
Sailor!- You up for that?

157
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,714
就算起天涯海角，我也會跟著你
I'd go to the far end of the world for you, baby.

158
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,587
你知道我願意
You know that.

159
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,360
太棒了!
Rockin' good news!

160
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,862
指甲油干了嗎，甜心？
Are those toenails about dry yet,sweetheart?

161
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,270
咱們跳舞去
We've got some dancing to do!

162
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:24,800
你是想給我機會向女友證明愛意
You gonna give me the opportunity to prove my love to my girl?

163
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:31,013
還是像個紳士一樣給她道歉，免得自找麻煩？
Or you gonna save yourself some trouble and apologize to her?

164
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:35,316
別惹我，伙計
Don't fuck with me, man.

165
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:43,862
你身上那張魚鱗讓你看起來像小丑
You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.

166
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:46,658
這是蛇皮夾克  
This is a snakeskin jacket..

167
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:49,723
它代表我的個性
It's a symbol of my individuality

168
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:53,101
和我對個人自由的信仰
and my belief in personal freedom.

169
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:56,601
王八蛋!
Asshole!

170
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,012
- 有種就來啊! - 賽勒，親愛的  
Come here!- Sailor, honey ...

171
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:08,420
很抱歉在大家面前出你洋相
I'm sorry to do this to you here in front of a crowd and all...

172
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:11,053
但我要你站起來向我的女友道歉
But I want you to get up and apologize to my girl.

173
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:19,900
對不起
I'm sorry.

174
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:25,774
算了，你隻是找錯了對像
You just bumped against the wrong girl, that's all.

175
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:29,710
好了，買杯啤酒去去火
Get yourself a beer.

176
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,645
各位閱歌無數
You fellas have a lot of the same power "E" had.

177
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:35,746
想必也知道這首
Do you know this one?

178
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:58,484
小賽，你怎麼沒為我唱"柔情似水"？
Sail', how come you didn't sing me "Love me tender"?

179
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:01,944
你說過那是你最喜歡的情歌
You told me that was your favorite love song.

180
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:06,791
我也說過我隻為妻子唱這首歌
I told you I'd only sing "Love me tender" to my wife.

181
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:32,049
有沒有想像過
Did you ever think something ...

182
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:35,320
一陣風聲從你耳邊擦過
you can hear a wind ...

183
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,160
從奧茲國的惡邪女巫，飛到你跟前
and see the Wicked Witch of the East come flyin' in?

184
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:48,666
我在牢裡時，真的很想念你的古怪念頭
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee.

185
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:52,115
當然也很想你的身體
The rest of your too, of course.

186
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:56,481
但你腦子裡的東西隻有上帝纔猜得透
But the way your head works is God's mystery.

187
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:58,849
你剛纔想到什麼？
What were you thinking?

188
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:06,156
其實，我在想抽煙的事
Well, I was thinking about smoking, actually.

189
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,867
我媽媽現在抽功勛牌
My mama smokes Merits now.

190
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:13,096
以前她抽總督牌
She used to smoke Viceroys.

191
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,536
從六年級我就開始偷她的煙
I started stealing 'em from her about 6th grade.

192
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:20,012
小賽，你什麼時候開始抽煙的？
When did you start smoking, Sail'?

193
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:24,707
大概是  
I started when I was about ...

194
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,353
四歲那年
four.

195
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,517
我媽那時己經得肺癌死了
My mom was already dead then from lung cancer.

196
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,458
- 她抽什麼牌子？  - 萬寶路，和我一樣
What brand did she smoke?- Marlboros, same as me.

197
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:39,567
我猜我爸媽要不是因為抽煙死的
I guess both my mom and my daddy died

198
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:42,038
就是因為酗酒
of smoke or alcohol related illness.

199
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,370
- 老天，小賽，真對不起 - 不要緊，親愛的     
Jeez, Sail', I'm sorry.- Its OK, honey.

200
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:49,013
反正我以前也很少和他們在一起
I hardly used to see them anyways.

201
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:52,780
我沒受多少家庭教育
I didn't have much parental guidance.

202
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:57,255
我的辯護人在聽證會上總是強調這點
The public defender kept saying that.

203
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,995
他是個好人，始終站在我這邊
He was a good boy, he stood by me.

204
00:25:03,734 --> 00:25:07,362
我也站在你這邊，小賽
I'd stand by you, Sail',

205
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,265
不管有多艱苦
through anything.

206
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:12,199
哎呀，我親愛的  
Hell, Peanut ...

207
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,812
我收拾了李蒙後，你就對我不離不棄
You stuck by me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon.

208
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,045
男人還能要求比這更多的東西嗎？
A man can't ask for more than that.

209
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,551
你令我感動，小賽
You move me, Sail'.

210
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:31,422
你真的令我感動
You really do.

211
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:35,867
你在我身體的最深處打下了烙印
You mark me the deepest.

212
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,503
對我來說，你就是我前世的孽緣
You're perfect for me too.

213
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:51,184
你讓我想起爸爸
You remind me of my daddy.

214
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:54,611
媽媽告訴我，他喜歡胸部堅挺
Mama told me he liked skinny women

215
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,922
身材瘦瘦的女人
with breasts that stood up and said "Hello".

216
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:05,397
他也有個長鼻子，和你一樣
He had a long nose too,just like yours.

217
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,803
我有告訴你我爸是怎麼死的嗎？
Did I ever tell you how my daddy died?

218
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:14,240
在我記憶裡，他是被燒死的
In a fire, as I recall.

219
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:16,239
是的  
Yeah ...

220
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:21,219
媽告訴我，他把煤油潑在自己身上
Mama told me he poured kerosene all over himself,

221
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:24,919
點燃一根火柴
and lit a match.

222
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:49,553
那是在我認識你的前一年
That was the year before I met you.

223
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:16,374
不，我還沒找到他們
No, I haven't found them yet.

224
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,280
- 你放輕松點，好嗎？ - 強尼!            
Just try to take it easy. - Johnnie!

225
00:27:20,858 --> 00:27:24,292
在你找到露拉之前，我會一直守在電話旁
I'm going to stay right here, by this telephone,

226
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:28,059
等你一找到我就去接她
until you find Lula.And then I'm coming to get her.

227
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:31,031
所以，一到新奧爾良馬上給我打電話
So call me the second you get to New Orleans.

228
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:34,228
- 我會的  - 拜托，別再讓我失望了
I will, honey. - Please don't let me down again!

229
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:37,603
- 我會想你的 - 那就快去快回!- 好的，再見    
I'll miss you. - Get going! - OK. Bye.

230
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,007
再見，親愛的
Bye, honey.

231
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:01,930
喂，我猜你現在已違反了假釋條例
Well, I guess you broke parole now.

232
00:28:02,504 --> 00:28:03,833
現在？
You guess?

233
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:09,068
寶貝，那是在200哩前我們穿過波蒂縣時的事了
My parole was broke 200 miles back, when we burned Portagee County.

234
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:17,745
我想我會找個地方，寄張明信片給媽媽
I guess I'll send Mama a postcard from somewhere.

235
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,917
我不希望她為了我瞎著急
I don't want her to worry more than necessary.

236
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:24,720
那不是我找你來的原因，桑托斯
That's not why I called you here, Santos.

237
00:28:25,532 --> 00:28:26,997
聞起來不像是酷牌的
That don't smell like a Kool.

238
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:31,091
不是，它是人生課程的一部分
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life.

239
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,339
開門見山吧
Just tell me what you want.

240
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:40,107
你難道沒有開始擔心什麼對你是有害的？
You ain't gonna start worrying about what's bad for you?

241
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:45,585
我是說  你現在可是和貨真價實的殺人犯一起穿州過界
I mean, here you are, crossing state lines with a real murderer ...

242
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:49,453
是過失殺人犯，親愛的，不是殺人犯，別誇大其辭
A man slaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.

243
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:52,185
好吧，就算是過失殺人犯
OK, man slaughterer ...

244
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:57,793
此人剛剛違反假釋條例，而且滿肚子壞水
who just broke parole and has only immoral purposes in mind,

245
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,233
- 但隻對你這位美麗小姐 - 上帝保佑            
as far as you're concerned. - Thank the Lord!

246
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,238
其實你沒有讓我失望，小賽
Well, you ain't let me down yet.. Sail'.

247
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,642
你比世上其他人強多了
That's more than I can say for the rest of the world.

248
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,080
你真體貼，心肝
You please me too, Peanut

249
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,356
你要我用槍打爆賽勒的腦袋？
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains, with a gun.

250
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:21,458
是的
Yes.

251
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:26,057
- 從前額？- 正是   
In the forehead?- Yes.

252
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,100
不對
Wrong!

253
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:32,634
從後腦勺打進去更爽
It's always better to blow a hole through the back of the head.

254
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:34,403
正好從裡面穿過  
Right through ...

255
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:36,912
鼻梁骨
to the nose.

256
00:29:39,216 --> 00:29:41,682
當場就能叫他命喪黃泉，神仙都救不回
Lots of irreparable damage.

257
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,288
明白了？
See?

258
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,521
我早料到你辦事穩妥
I knew you had it under control.

259
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:53,518
你反應有點慢，但己開始進入狀況了
You are a little slow, but you're beginning to get it.

260
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:59,000
你怎麼不讓強尼•費拉加特去？
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?

261
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,664
或許我已經叫了呢
Maybe I did.

262
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:05,877
你不妨到新奧爾良打聽一下
Why don't you look in New Orleans?

263
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:10,212
- 露拉總是把這名字掛在嘴邊 - 有個條件                
Lula always talks about that town. - On one condition;

264
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:15,018
你得讓我干掉強尼•費拉加特
You give me permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.

265
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,215
桑托斯，拜托!
Santos, please!

266
00:30:18,327 --> 00:30:20,226
你該不會想說，還對他情深意重吧？
You're not telling me you're that sweet on him?

267
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:22,658
- 什麼？沒有    - 你對他真這麼痴心？
What? No ... - Are you that sweet on him?

268
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:25,895
- 不是，可    - 遲早他會發現  
No, but ... - One day he's gonna find out

269
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:30,065
我們和阮迪先生干的勾當，到時麻煩就大了
what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer,and he can cause us a lot of trouble.

270
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:36,142
沉默等於默許
I'll take your silence as a "yes".

271
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:39,979
- 不，不行，桑托斯   - 噓，別著急       
No, ... no, Santos ... - Shhh, it's OK.

272
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,781
- 沒事的     - 不，別殺強尼
It's alright.- No! You're not gonna kill him!

273
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:46,850
- 你不能殺他   - 不會的，不會  
You're not gonna kill him! - No, no ...

274
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:52,992
不，別殺強尼，你要殺的是賽勒
No, not Johnnie.You kill Sailor!

275
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,162
我是打算要殺死賽勒
I am going to kill Sailor.

276
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,435
你放心好了
You can be certain of that.

277
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:19,452
喂，阮迪先生，我是桑托斯
Hello, Mr. Reindeer. Marcello Santos speaking.

278
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,401
嗨，是您啊，桑托斯先生!
Mr. Marcello Santos. Hey there!

279
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:29,267
您上個月給我的貨真不賴
That was great shit you sent last in last month.

280
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:34,072
我有一件麻煩事
I've got a problem.

281
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:37,282
事實上，是兩件
A couple of problems, in fact.

282
00:31:37,918 --> 00:31:39,885
兩件麻煩事？
A couple of problems?

283
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:45,922
每一件你都得往我的郵箱裡投一枚銀幣
For each problem, drop a silver dollar through my mail slot.

284
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,052
再附上所有的詳細資料
With all particulars.

285
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:52,135
我們會替你打理好的
We'll work out "il conto" later.

286
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:55,530
祝你愉快!
Have a beautiful day!

287
00:32:04,951 --> 00:32:06,541
就像我們
We are.

288
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:30,073
注意行為檢點，這是傳道家吉米的地盤
Keep them panties up,we're in Jimmy Swaggart country!

289
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:53,996
知道嗎？
You know what?

290
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:57,837
蘇西那小賤人偷了我的梳子
That little bitch Susie stole my comb.

291
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,105
我最恨這種事
I hate that.

292
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:03,342
那個小騷貨
The stupid little shit!

293
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,248
我在打電話
Phone's ringing.

294
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:16,395
唐娜
Juana.

295
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:20,435
今天有人給我送來兩個銀幣
A couple of silver dollars came my way today.

296
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,599
其中一個是你的，還有一份受益人的資料
I'm sending one to you, with a paper on the beneficiary.

297
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:28,540
老規矩，隻要能完成任務
As usual, you are completely free to fulfill the obligation

298
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,039
你想用什麼方式都可以
in any manner you so desire.

299
00:33:32,952 --> 00:33:35,613
叫雷吉和無影來這裡
In fact, send Reggie and Drop Shadow over,

300
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:37,950
取銀幣和資料
for the silver dollar and the papers.

301
00:33:38,492 --> 00:33:39,458
馬上
Now.

302
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:45,520
他們已經上路了，另外那枚給了誰？
They're on their way. Who's getting' the second silver dollar?

303
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,563
這個你不用操心
That's for me to know.

304
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:49,498
成交？
Yeah?

305
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:52,261
多謝了，阮先生
Thanks, Mr. Reindeer.

306
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,831
玩個痛快，親愛的
Have fun, darling.

307
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:13,295
你好啊，我的小伙子
How you doin', my boy?

308
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,466
有時候，當我們在做愛時
Sometimes, when we're making love,

309
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:23,009
你幾乎要把我帶到彩虹上，讓我飄飄欲仙
you just about take me right over that rainbow.

310
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,140
你對我了解得一清二楚，知道我想要什麼
You're so aware of what goes on in me,I mean, you pay attention.

311
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,949
我發誓，寶貝，你那根是最棒的
And I swear, baby, you got the sweetest cock.

312
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:36,888
你在我裡面時，它好像在對我說話
It's like it's talking to me when you're inside.

313
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:40,889
你和我真是天生一對
You get right on me.

314
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:46,433
我沒法不承認，你是個危險的小芭比
You are dangerously cute, baby, I got to admit it.

315
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,744
咱們去見識一下新奧爾良的聲色犬馬
Let's go out into the crazy world of New Orleans!

316
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:57,107
再來一份油炸95蕉三明治
Let's get a fried banana sandwich.

317
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:10,260
這簡直是我見過最有趣的小玩意兒
That's about the cutest thing I've ever seen.

318
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:53,942
笨人就像瘟疫，把地方搞得亂糟糟，你們都瞧見啦
Pigeons spread diseases and mess up the place. You've seen it.

319
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,007
偉大古老的新奧爾良!
The big N.O.!

320
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:23,476
桑托斯？我不知道  
Santos? I don't know ...

321
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:27,612
我改變主意了
I'm having second thoughts.

322
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,415
你想怎麼樣？
Guess what?

323
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,414
覆水難收，難道你不知道？
There's no turnin' back, remember?

324
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:39,059
- 我現在隻想大開殺戒 - 桑托斯            
I'm in a killing mood. - Santos!

325
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:44,638
- 我在波本街上看見你的男朋友 - 我拿不定主意              
I saw your boyfriend on Bourbon Street. - I'm not sure ...

326
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,173
什麼？你現在在新奧爾良？
What? Are you in New Orleans?

327
00:37:48,714 --> 00:37:50,647
瘋婊子
Crazy fucking bitch!

328
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:20,143
姑娘們!
Ladies!

329
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,580
你們是什麼？
What are you?

330
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:26,480
你們不僅僅是一張帶著該死的微笑的臉
You're not just a pretty face with a fucking smile.

331
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,023
你們在這兒是為了讓阮先生快活的
You're here to make Mr. Reindeer happy.

332
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:31,526
讓他享受段美好時光
And to show him a good time.

333
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:36,462
別自討苦喫
Do not bring misfortune upon yourselves.

334
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:58,483
把銀幣給你時忘了  
When I gave you the silver dollar, I forgot

335
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,152
忘了把這信封一起給你
to include the contents of this envelope.

336
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:03,527
現在把它送給你
They are to be returned.

337
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:09,166
下手前，先把它亮出來
Show it just before the deed.

338
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,158
我知道那天我學到人生重要一課
I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.

339
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:34,097
當她走到最高一級時，我把手插進她兩腿間
When she got to the top step,I stuck my hand between her legs.

340
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:38,037
寶貝，你可真是個壞小子!
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

341
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:41,801
寶貝，你可真是個壞小子!
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

342
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:44,874
她也這麼說
That's just what she said.

343
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:50,181
我的老二硬得像石頭一樣
I had a boner with a capital "O".

344
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:52,716
總之，我發現她的房間
Anyway, I found her lying

345
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:56,690
塞滿槍支和色情雜志
in a room filled with guns and porno magazines.

346
00:40:57,229 --> 00:41:00,628
於是我又把手插進她兩根大腿
So, I slid my hand between her legs again,

347
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,926
她緊接著就把腿合了起來
and she closed her thighs.

348
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,832
你撩得我受不了了，甜心
You're exciting me, honey.

349
00:41:06,473 --> 00:41:08,200
接著呢？
Then what did she do?

350
00:41:08,742 --> 00:41:11,869
她把臉半埋在枕頭裡
Her face was half pushed into the pillow,

351
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:17,109
我記得她轉頭看看我，說道:
and I remember, she looked back over her shoulder at me and said;

352
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,346
我不給你吹喇叭，別讓我給你吹
"I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you."

353
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:23,287
多可惜，她不知道自己錯過了最好的
Poor baby, she doesn't know what she missed.

354
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:26,952
- 她頭發什麼顏色？ - 很深的黑色     
What color hair did she have? - Jet black,

355
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:29,358
但男士們都比較喜歡金發女郎
but gentlemen prefer blondes.

356
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,093
總之，聽聽這段  
Anyway, dig this;

357
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:34,193
她轉過身子
She turns over,

358
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:38,238
褪掉她那條橘色內褲
peels off them orange pants,

359
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:42,040
兩條腿分得很開
spreads her legs real wide

360
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:45,945
然後對我說: 咬一口桃子吧
and says to me; "Take a bite of peach."

361
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:51,286
我的天! 親愛的，看來你是賺了
Jesus, honey, you more than sort of got what you come for.

362
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,889
寶貝，你最好趕快帶我回旅館
Baby, you better run me back to the hotel.

363
00:41:57,532 --> 00:42:00,398
你撩得我全身比柏油還要熱
You've got me hotter than Georgia asphalt.

364
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,732
不說了，但放過我吧，心肝
Say no more, but go easy on me, sweetheart,

365
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,671
明天還得開很久的車
tomorrow we got a lot of driving to do.

366
00:42:09,912 --> 00:42:11,708
比柏油還熱
Hotter than Georgia asphalt.

367
00:43:27,034 --> 00:43:32,164
我們要是一輩子相親相愛，豈不棒透了？
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we someway stayed in love forever?

368
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:38,675
有時你冒出的念頭真夠絕頂古怪
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, Peanut.

369
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:42,447
我們不是一直都很快活嗎？
Ain't we been doing a pretty fair job thus far?

370
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:46,615
你很清楚我指的是什麼，甜心
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, sugar.

371
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:51,651
這會讓未來變得簡單又美好
It'd make the future so simple and nice.

372
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:53,558
我這輩子做過一些
I've done a few things

373
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,190
我不怎麼引以為傲的事
in my life which I ain't too proud of.

374
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:04,571
但從現在起，我不會做任何虧心事
But from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason.

375
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:07,772
我還真知道
All I know for sure is there's more than a few bad ideas

376
00:44:08,316 --> 00:44:09,747
我們周圍的確有不少壞念頭
runnin' loose out there.

377
00:44:14,556 --> 00:44:18,150
有件事我從來沒對你提起過
There's something I ain't never told you about.

378
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,790
這個故事提醒人們要對壞念頭吸取教訓
This here's a story with a lesson about bad ideas.

379
00:44:25,403 --> 00:44:26,334
什麼故事？
What's that?

380
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:31,533
我的表兄戴爾一天到晚都受壞念頭折磨
Well, my cousin Dell was always fighting bad ideas.

381
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,977
他非常喜歡聖誕節，我們常常叫他
See, Dell loved Christmas.We used to call him

382
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:37,776
"聖誕仔"
"Jingle Dell".

383
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,976
他希望一年到頭都是聖誕
He wanted Christmas to last all year long.

384
00:44:41,487 --> 00:44:45,388
如果他媽媽告訴他，現在纔是夏天
He sure would scream when his mom told him it was summer,

385
00:44:45,926 --> 00:44:48,826
聖誕節還要等上六個月，他就會尖聲怪叫
and Christmas was six months off.

386
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,095
他還說
Also, he said ...

387
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,328
總覺得有一群戴著黑橡皮手套的人
he felt there's men

388
00:44:59,942 --> 00:45:03,138
跟著他四圍走
with black rubber gloves who were following him around.

389
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:08,043
戴爾說他對聖誕節的鐘愛
Dell said that trust in the spirit of Christmas was destroyed

390
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:13,578
被戴黑手套的外星人給破壞了
by ideas being controlled by aliens wearing black gloves.

391
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,924
他們會逼他做各種事
These aliens would get Dell to do all kinds of things.

392
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:21,892
然後他話題一轉，談起天氣
Then he'd carry on about the weather,

393
00:45:22,434 --> 00:45:26,699
說起外星人是如何控制地球的天氣
talk about how rainfall is controlled by aliens on earth.

394
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,996
露提阿姨告訴他，有一天他會發現
Aunt Rootie told him that one day he would realize

395
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:35,067
戴黑手套的外星人其實就是他自己
that the alien wearing the black gloves was him,

396
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,410
不是別人
and him alone.

397
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:45,585
聽起來老戴爾的問題不小
Sounds like old Dell was more than just a bit confused.

398
00:45:48,264 --> 00:45:50,390
戴爾真是活受罪
Dell was learning a hard lesson.

399
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,662
居然整晚不睡，拼命做三明治
It got so he would stay up all night making sandwiches.

400
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,173
戴爾，你在做什麼？
Dell, what are you doing?

401
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:08,580
我在做我的午飯!
I'm making my lunch!

402
00:46:10,356 --> 00:46:13,984
媽媽告訴我，戴爾的媽媽露提阿姨
Mama told me Aunt Rootie, that's Dell's mama,

403
00:46:16,664 --> 00:46:19,153
在他的內褲上找到蟑螂
found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

404
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:23,460
有一回，她還發現戴爾
One time, she found Dell

405
00:46:23,972 --> 00:46:26,598
把一隻大蟑螂放到屁眼上
putting one big cockroach on his anus.

406
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:28,768
老天! 乖乖
Hell, Peanut!

407
00:46:35,018 --> 00:46:37,008
這可不怎麼好玩
It ain't so funny now, though.

408
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:40,417
戴爾失蹤了
Dell disappeared.

409
00:46:41,058 --> 00:46:42,854
從此沒人見過他
Nobody's seen him since.

410
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:48,190
可惜他沒辦法
Too bad he couldn't visit

411
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:52,828
拜訪那位奧茲國的魔法師
that old Wizard of Dz,

412
00:46:54,073 --> 00:46:56,199
從他那裡得到一些好建議
and get some good advice.

413
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:00,869
可惜我們都不能，寶貝
Too bad we all can't, baby.

414
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:20,693
是你嗎，強尼？
Are you there, Johnnie?

415
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,228
怎麼了，親愛的？
What's wrong, honey?

416
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,577
強尼，親愛的，我有事告訴你
Johnnie, sweetheart. Wait, I've got something to tell you.

417
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:36,676
我想讓你知道
I want you to know something.

418
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:39,950
我做了件蠢事，很蠢
I've done something so bad, real bad.

419
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:44,255
- 什麼事？  - 電話裡說不清楚
What?   - Not on the phone! No ...

420
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:48,630
我明天到新奧爾良，當面告訴你，行嗎？
I'm coming to New Orleans tomorrow to tell you in person. OK?

421
00:47:49,204 --> 00:47:53,936
別這樣對我，換了我，你也會急的，快說吧
Don't do this to me. You'd freak out if I did that to you. Now what is it?

422
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,800
不，我不會在電話裡說
No,I'm not gonna tell you on the phone.

423
00:47:58,446 --> 00:48:01,539
但是親愛的，我馬上就要動身去跟他們
But honey, I gotta leave right now and get on their trail.

424
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,747
他們來過這裡，今天早上從巴西旅館走了
The kids were here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil this morning.

425
00:48:06,455 --> 00:48:07,977
不!
No!

426
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:10,491
留在原地別動! 哪兒都別去
Stay right there! Don't go anywhere!

427
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:13,461
我搭七點的飛機，明天就到皮德蒙特
I'm coming in on Piedmont tomorrow, on the 7 o'clock flight.

428
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:20,434
- 我們一起去追露拉   - 好，如果你一定要這麼做
We're going after Lula together! - OK, if that's what you want.

429
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,837
但是我反對
But I'm against it!

430
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:25,976
明天
7 o'clock,

431
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,409
晚上七點，親愛的  
tomorrow evening. Sugar, ...

432
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:31,347
然後到我們最喜歡的法國餐館喫晚飯，好嗎？
We'll have dinner at our favorite French restaurant, OK?

433
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:35,116
你安排一下，好嗎？到時見
You fix it up. OK, bye now?

434
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:37,756
我愛你
I love you.

435
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:41,323
瑪麗葉塔？
Marietta?

436
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,748
咱們還剩多少錢，寶貝？
How much we got left, baby?

437
00:50:00,354 --> 00:50:01,819
不到一百塊
Under 100.

438
00:50:02,456 --> 00:50:04,355
要不要你休息一下
You want me to drive

439
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:08,793
- 讓我開一會兒？ - 好主意       
so you can get a bit of rest? - Yeah, that'd be good.

440
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:30,077
德州聖安東尼奧電臺，今晚你都在想些什麼？
Come in, San Antonio, Texas. What's on your mind this evening?

441
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:33,221
我剛動了一個心髒手術
I just had triple bypass,open-heart surgery,

442
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:37,488
但聽你這種人的節目讓我恨不得馬上出院
and it's people like you who make me wanna get out of the hospital ...

443
00:50:38,064 --> 00:50:40,428
怎麼會有這種垃圾？
How can anyone listen to this crap?

444
00:50:41,368 --> 00:50:44,461
  她不久前離婚，槍殺自己三個小孩，一個七歲  
... for her recent divorce, shot her three children, aged seven ...

445
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,206
一位法官
A judge

446
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:50,505
偏袒被告約翰•洛伊
praised defendant John Roy, but was dismayed to learn

447
00:50:51,046 --> 00:50:53,308
但在聽說洛伊有奸尸的行為後驚慌失措  
that he'd had sex with the corpse.

448
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:54,973
什麼？
What?

449
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,446
去年十月，印度當局把500隻海龜放進恆河
State authorities, last October released 500 turtles into the Ganges,

450
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:02,148
企圖改善河水的污染狀況
to try and reduce human pollution,

451
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,726
現在準備將鱷魚放進河裡，以吞喫窮人的尸體  
and will now use crocodiles to eat corpses dumped by poor Hindus ...

452
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:11,028
我的天! 這簡直就像《活死人之夜》
Holy shit! It's Night of the Living Dead!

453
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:15,262
- 怎麼了，寶貝？     - 我再也受不了這個收音機
What's that, Peanut? - I can't take any more of this radio!

454
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,569
我這輩子還沒聽過這麼多恐怖的事
I've never heard so much shit in all my life!

455
00:51:19,078 --> 00:51:23,343
賽勒•瑞普利，馬上給我換個音樂臺! 快
Sailor Ripley, you get me some music now! I mean it!

456
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,509
  性攻擊的受害者  分尸  強暴  
... victim of a sexual assault ... ... mutilated ... raped ...

457
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:53,082
強尼，現在我不能告訴你，但是聽我說
Johnnie, I can't tell you now, honey, but listen;

458
00:52:53,652 --> 00:52:57,678
我們能否今晚就出發？
Is there any way, any way that we could get on the road tonight?

459
00:52:58,193 --> 00:53:03,459
昨晚你打電話給我時一定是受了很大刺激
Something was upsetting you bad last night when you called.

460
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:06,159
你肯定想告訴我什麼事
And you wanted to tell me.

461
00:53:06,802 --> 00:53:10,292
所以我推測你需要我的幫助
So I figured that you wanted me to help you.

462
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:12,900
的確是
I did.

463
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:17,207
你說得沒錯，但那是昨晚的事
Oh, I did.But that was last night.

464
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:21,547
現在我需要你幫忙，我們要找到露拉，否則就遲了
Now I need your help. We have to find Lula before it's too late.

465
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:25,387
- 親愛的，有件事我想問你  - 說吧                 
Honey, I have to ask you something. - Okay.

466
00:53:27,258 --> 00:53:29,884
桑托斯也參與了這件事嗎？
Is Santos involved in this in any way?

467
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:34,792
當然沒有
Hell no!

468
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:39,562
你以為我會不跟你商量 就做出這種事嗎？
Do you think I would do something like that without coming to you?

469
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:43,133
親愛的，對不起
I'm sorry, honey.

470
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,440
- 都是普謙斯基那狗雜種惹的禍! - 誰，"苟"叔叔？               
Goddamned Pucinski, son of a bitch! - Who, Uncle Pooch?

471
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:53,315
那個把桑托斯介紹給你和克萊德的王八蛋
The son of a bitch who introduced Santos to you and Clyde.

472
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,650
強尼  
Johnnie ...

473
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,821
以前的事別提了
That's all the past.

474
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:03,457
現在你和我必須做的是  
Now what you and I have to do ...

475
00:54:04,234 --> 00:54:06,826
是考慮咱們的未來
is think about our future.

476
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,897
這話當真？
Do you mean that?

477
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,600
當然是，敢不敢用你的性感臀部打賭？
You bet your sweet ass I do!

478
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:17,373
天哪
Gosh.

479
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:21,746
我說過再見到你真太好了嗎？
Did I tell you how great it was to see you again?

480
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:26,185
纔說了五遍而已
Just about five times, that's all.

481
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:37,999
- 天，強尼，我愛你! - 我也愛你       
Oh God, Johnnie, I love you! - I love you too.

482
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:43,671
我們趕快離開這裡去找露拉吧
Let's get our backsides out of this town and go get my Lula!

483
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:14,245
什麼事讓你心煩了，親愛的？
What's troublin' you, sugar?

484
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,081
露拉，你知道
You know, Lula ...

485
00:55:20,656 --> 00:55:23,647
我從來沒告訴過你，遇見你之前我是做什麼的
I never told you what all I was doing before I met you.

486
00:55:24,194 --> 00:55:28,857
我以為你是個到處混的酷哥
I just figured you were out being Mr. Cool.

487
00:55:29,399 --> 00:55:31,160
不全是
Not exactly, sugar.

488
00:55:31,803 --> 00:55:37,900
我們如今的麻煩也與我當年的工作有關
One reason we're in this trouble is because of what I was doing.

489
00:55:38,477 --> 00:55:40,739
我曾經想要告訴你
I tried to tell you this before.

490
00:55:41,814 --> 00:55:43,872
你嚇到我了，寶貝
You're scaring me, baby.

491
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,880
凡事都有好壞兩面
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it.

492
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:52,682
如今好的一面是我認識你爸爸克萊德，他是個好人
The good side is that I knew your daddy. Clyde was a good guy.

493
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:56,092
- 你認識他？ - 是的     
You knew my daddy? - Yes.

494
00:55:57,264 --> 00:55:58,889
我認識他
I sure did.

495
00:56:00,202 --> 00:56:01,599
壞的一面是  
The bad side of it ...

496
00:56:02,403 --> 00:56:05,132
我曾經給一個叫馬切羅•桑托斯的人開過車
is I did some driving for a man named Marcello Santos.

497
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:07,229
真該死
Oh Shit.

498
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:10,169
我後來辭了工
I quit working for him,

499
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:13,715
但在那之前，我有天晚上到了一所房子
but just before I did,I ended up one night at a house.

500
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:15,910
我當時並不知道
I didn't know it then,

501
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:18,385
那就是你家
but it was your house.

502
00:56:19,756 --> 00:56:22,417
我不知道他們以為那晚我看到了什麼
I don't know what they think I saw that night.

503
00:56:23,061 --> 00:56:26,324
我隻是待在車裡，直到整間房子燒了起來
I was just sitting out in the car,'til the whole place went up in flames.

504
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:33,632
天啊，賽勒，我爸爸就在那天晚上死的
Oh God, Sailor,that's the night my daddy died!

505
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:36,539
我知道，親愛的
I know, sugar.

506
00:56:43,117 --> 00:56:44,140
老爸？
Daddy?

507
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,021
那是  
That's ...

508
00:56:51,226 --> 00:56:55,161
你藏著的大秘密，小賽
some big secret you've been carrying, Sail'.

509
00:56:56,399 --> 00:56:58,525
我們都藏有不可告人的秘密，寶貝
We all got a secret side, baby.

510
00:56:59,737 --> 00:57:03,193
但願你別以為我還向你撒了別的謊
I hope you don't think I been lyin' to you about other things.

511
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,898
露拉，你在聽嗎？
Lula, you there?

512
00:57:36,612 --> 00:57:38,202
對，我在聽  
Yeah, I'm here ...

513
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:44,577
你在生我的氣？
You upset with me?

514
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:48,986
隻是感到很震驚  
It just shocking sometimes ...

515
00:57:50,628 --> 00:57:53,494
聽到事情原來並非和你想的那樣
when things aren't what you thought they were.

516
00:58:07,581 --> 00:58:10,173
但我們已經沒法回頭，不是嗎？
We're really in the middle of it now, ain't we?

517
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:40,916
我很快就收拾好，你在樓下等我
I'm gonna pack real fast, then I'll meet you downstairs.

518
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,421
我的天，要是今晚能和你一起享用那張大床就好了
My God, what we could've done on that kingsize bed tonight!

519
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:49,620
- 別擔心，我會給你補償的   - 那好                 
Don't worry, I'll make up for it! - Alright.

520
00:58:54,736 --> 00:58:56,862
- 待會見 - 好的  
See you in a minute. - Okay.

521
00:58:58,907 --> 00:59:00,236
瑪麗葉塔  
Marietta ...

522
00:59:37,016 --> 00:59:38,538
那是什麼東西？
What's that?

523
00:59:40,387 --> 00:59:43,013
不知道，像衣服
I don't know ... Looks like clothes.

524
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:06,244
天啊，賽勒!
Oh God, Sailor!

525
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:08,719
一樁嚴重的車禍
One bad car accident.

526
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:52,334
我們該怎麼辦？
What should we do?

527
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:55,460
不知道，但是得幫幫那個女孩，帶她去鎮上
I don't know, but we got to help that girl, get her to a town,

528
01:00:56,075 --> 01:00:59,440
但願別讓人發現我違反假釋規定
and hope nobody finds out that I broke parole.

529
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:04,314
發卡  
This bobby pin ...

530
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:08,144
我找不到了
I can't find it.

531
01:01:08,756 --> 01:01:11,382
媽媽會宰了我的  我的信用卡都在裡面  
My mother's gonna kill me ... ... it's got all my cards ...

532
01:01:12,027 --> 01:01:13,117
都在錢包裡
It was in my pocket.

533
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,858
錢包不見了，幫我找找  
Now my pocket's gone.Gotta help me find it ...

534
01:01:18,268 --> 01:01:23,295
我所有的信用卡  都在錢包裡  
All my cards ...and it was in my pocket, and ...

535
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:31,639
我的錢包不見了! 她開始罵我了
My purse is gone!Now she tells me!

536
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:34,116
- 我們快抓住她!- 她能活下來嗎？
Let's get a hold of her!- Is she going to make it?

537
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,117
不知道，但她的血會流我們一車
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car!

538
01:01:37,657 --> 01:01:40,146
嘿  嘿，姑娘
Hey ... hello! Girl!

539
01:01:41,394 --> 01:01:43,190
跟我們走，親愛的
Come with us, honey!

540
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,355
別踫我
Leave me alone!

541
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:52,438
羅伯特？
Robert?

542
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:54,906
羅伯特!
Robert!

543
01:01:59,413 --> 01:02:00,436
媽的
Shit.

544
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:04,509
我頭發裡有該死的粘乎乎的東西  
Got this damned sticky stuff in my hair ...

545
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:10,121
我頭發裡有粘乎乎的東西
... got sticky stuff in my hair.

546
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,750
最好跟我們走，親愛的，來吧
Better come with us, honey. Come on!

547
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,761
我要找錢包  別告訴我媽媽，求求你們
Gotta find my wallet ... Don't tell my mother, please.

548
01:02:17,268 --> 01:02:18,733
天啊，她會宰了我的
God, she's gonna kill me!

549
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,203
不用擔心這個  
Can't worry about that ...

550
01:02:23,276 --> 01:02:27,177
- 我的梳子在哪？   - 天啊，她會在我們面前死掉
Where's my hairbrush? - God, she's dying right in front of us.

551
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:38,083
幫我拿一下唇膏  
Get my lipstick ...

552
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:42,296
在我的錢包裡
It's in my purse.

553
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:47,727
她死在我們面前，賽勒  
She died right in front of us, Sailor ...

554
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:50,271
為什麼她非要這麼做？
Why'd she have to go and do that?

555
01:02:53,476 --> 01:02:55,203
我們走吧，心肝
Let's get outta here, honey.

556
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:09,957
上天保佑
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

557
01:04:06,562 --> 01:04:09,461
我真是一點兒都想不通
I don't understand this one tiny bit.

558
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:14,022
說好我在樓下大廳等他
See, he told me to wait for him here in that lobby there.

559
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:20,003
可現在我感覺他發生了什麼可怕的事
What I feel is that something terrible has happened to him.

560
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,930
也許我們應該報警？
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer?

561
01:04:25,477 --> 01:04:27,238
不，千萬不要，請別這麼做
No, please! Please no!

562
01:04:27,846 --> 01:04:31,746
我最不願意看到警察插手
The last thing I need is some damned policeman

563
01:04:32,316 --> 01:04:33,872
在這裡問東問西
moving and going around here ...

564
01:04:34,452 --> 01:04:37,942
不行，我不能容忍  不能  
No, I just can't ... no ... no.

565
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:43,419
對不起，我剛纔肯定是忘了這個
I am sorry ... I must have overlooked this.

566
01:04:43,995 --> 01:04:46,587
真的很抱歉，夫人
I'm truly
'
sorry, ma am.

567
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,399
是什麼？
What?

568
01:05:04,658 --> 01:05:05,884
可不可以  ？
Could you ...?

569
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:11,326
"約了朋友釣魚  
"Gone fishing with a friend ...

570
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:16,162
或者還去獵野牛"
and maybe buffalo hunting, too."

571
01:05:16,868 --> 01:05:18,094
獵野牛？
Buffalo hunting?

572
01:05:19,069 --> 01:05:20,659
"我去獵野牛"？
"I've gone buffalo hunting."?

573
01:05:22,573 --> 01:05:26,234
該死的，"獵野牛"是什麼意思？
What the fuck does "Buffalo hunting" mean?

574
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:29,506
我肯定我不會明白，我是說  
Well, I am sure I wouldn't know, I mean ...

575
01:05:30,047 --> 01:05:31,842
我的天  
My God ...

576
01:05:33,049 --> 01:05:34,674
他害怕了
He's afraid.

577
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:38,914
他又臨陣脫逃!
He's done it again!

578
01:05:39,422 --> 01:05:40,751
這個王八蛋又當逃兵!
The fucker split!

579
01:05:43,058 --> 01:05:45,490
"我做了一個承諾"
"I've made a commitment."

580
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:47,257
瑪麗葉塔!
Marietta!

581
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,319
桑托斯!
Santos!

582
01:05:51,066 --> 01:05:54,500
趁這個機會，我懇請你們
Gentlemen, I'd like to take this opportunity to ask you;

583
01:05:55,337 --> 01:05:58,633
- 滾出去!  - 這麼無禮
Please, clear out! - How rude!

584
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,769
- 我也要？  - 對，你也滾
Me too? - Yeah, you too.

585
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:18,485
你對強尼做了什麼？他在哪？
What did you do to Johnnie? Where's Johnnie?

586
01:06:19,658 --> 01:06:20,714
這兒發生了什麼事？
What's happening here?

587
01:06:21,326 --> 01:06:25,283
告訴我發生了什麼事，桑托斯，告訴我
Tell me what's happening here! Santos, tell me!

588
01:06:25,863 --> 01:06:27,488
你哭了？
You been crying?

589
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:32,500
你得改掉哭鼻子的壞習慣，明白嗎？
You gotta cut out this crybaby stuff, you know?

590
01:06:33,937 --> 01:06:36,563
你現在是我的女人，桑托斯  
You're my girl now, and Santos ...

591
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:39,000
桑托斯  
Santos ...

592
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:43,873
桑托斯要擦掉這些淚珠
Santos wants to wipe away the tears,

593
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:47,473
讓你快樂
and make you happy.

594
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,210
你得告訴我  
I want you to tell me ...

595
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,986
你得告訴我  
I want you to tell me ...

596
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:59,148
你對強尼做了什麼事？有沒有傷害他，快說
Did you do anything to Johnnie?Did you hurt him? I want to know.

597
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:03,494
我沒有對強尼•費拉加特做任何事
I did not do anything to Johnnie Farragut.

598
01:07:04,765 --> 01:07:07,061
你能以你母親的名義發誓？
You swear, on your mother?

599
01:07:08,269 --> 01:07:13,364
- 我發誓，以我母親的名義 - 天啊! 天啊            
I swear. On my mother. - God! Oh God!

600
01:07:13,907 --> 01:07:15,372
來吧，我們得走了
Come on. We have to go.

601
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:17,941
我得到消息:
I got word;

602
01:07:18,511 --> 01:07:19,976
那兩個孩子正在穿越德州
The kids are moving through Texas.

603
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:24,140
大團圓結局正在安排，很快就會在那上演
And I think a happy end is being arranged there.

604
01:07:25,384 --> 01:07:27,645
這就對了，笑一個
That's it, give me a smile!

605
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,818
桑托斯  
Oh Santos.

606
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:37,683
你是唯一一個
You're the only one

607
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:40,591
總是為我兩肋插刀的人
that always came through for me.

608
01:07:54,077 --> 01:07:58,842
我知道你現在怕得要命，強尼,再來一個吻，雷吉
I smell your shit now, Johnnie. Give us one more kiss, Reggie!

609
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:02,346
噢，操我!
Oh, fuck me!

610
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:06,207
操我!
Fuck me!

611
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:08,477
操我!
Fuck me!

612
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:30,739
我們現在要獵野牛了
We hunt buffalo now.

613
01:08:31,276 --> 01:08:33,037
等不及了!
Can't wait no more!

614
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:45,682
記住，數到十
Remember the number ... ten!

615
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,818
我沒法攔住她，強尼
I can't stop her, Johnnie.

616
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:56,124
但我會拿著這把老槍站在你身後
But I gonna be standing behind you with this big old gun!

617
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,997
一把海軍陸戰隊用的老家伙!
It's a Marine issue!

618
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:10,273
開始了  
I go out now ...

619
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:17,374
- 雷吉!  - 有   
Reggie!  - Yes?

620
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:20,273
給他看看!
Show him now!

621
01:09:25,959 --> 01:09:27,390
親愛的  
Honey ...

622
01:09:29,262 --> 01:09:30,887
差點忘了讓你瞧瞧!
I forget to show you this!

623
01:09:31,864 --> 01:09:33,386
桑托斯？
Santos?

624
01:09:34,934 --> 01:09:37,195
天啊，瑪麗葉塔，我親愛的  
Oh God, Marietta, honey ...

625
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,650
1  
One ...

626
01:10:02,191 --> 01:10:04,589
- 再會了  - 2     
Bye now!  - two ...

627
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:07,850
3  4  
three ... four ...

628
01:10:08,363 --> 01:10:10,454
我焚身以火，雷吉!
Gettin' too hot now, Reggie!

629
01:10:11,099 --> 01:10:12,655
5  
five ...

630
01:10:13,201 --> 01:10:14,257
  感覺自己  
... feeling myself ...

631
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,065
6  
six ...

632
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:18,567
7  
seven ...

633
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,069
8  
eight ...

634
01:10:20,807 --> 01:10:21,703
9  
nine ...

635
01:10:23,043 --> 01:10:24,872
操我，雷吉!
Fuck me now, Reggie!

636
01:10:25,845 --> 01:10:26,707
10!
ten!

637
01:10:30,016 --> 01:10:33,950
(德州金槍魚鎮)

638
01:10:47,197 --> 01:10:49,925
到底為什麼你要到金槍魚鎮來，小賽？
Why in the hell d'you want to come to Big Tuna, Sail'?

639
01:10:51,034 --> 01:10:53,330
我知道，這裡不是翡翠城  
I know it's not exactly Emerald City ...

640
01:10:54,571 --> 01:10:56,002
雖然這離加州也太遠了
Not as bad as the weather, ...

641
01:10:57,341 --> 01:11:00,433
但還不至於比這天氣更糟
'though it's a long way off that road to California.

642
01:11:02,211 --> 01:11:05,178
到底為什麼你要到這兒來，寶貝？
Why in the hell d'you want to come here, baby?

643
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:38,129
啊，瞧這兒!
Oh, look at this!

644
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:43,112
你想要什麼，蛇皮先生？
What do you want, Mr. Snakeskin?

645
01:11:43,848 --> 01:11:46,280
我來是想知道你會不會告訴我，是否有人想殺我
I was hoping you could tell me if there's a contract out on me.

646
01:11:46,952 --> 01:11:49,213
- 我真的需要知道  - 誰想殺你？     
I really need to know.  - By who?

647
01:11:49,855 --> 01:11:52,287
桑托斯，或是瑪麗葉塔•佛曲
Santos. Or Marietta Fortune.

648
01:11:53,758 --> 01:11:56,054
聽說你和那婊子的閨女打得火熱
I heard you were going with that bitch's daughter.

649
01:11:56,628 --> 01:12:01,586
- 沒錯               - 你是天字第一號蠢蛋
You heard right.  - You are one big, stupid asshole.

650
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:07,363
難道你不知道她媽和桑托斯合謀殺了她爸？
Don't you know that her mami and Santos killed her daddy?

651
01:12:10,106 --> 01:12:13,540
也許有天晚上，你離火太近
So maybe one night you got too close to a fire ...

652
01:12:14,109 --> 01:12:16,007
因此引火自焚
So maybe you're gonna burn.

653
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:21,311
- 我什麼都沒看到.  - 當然，可我看到了
I didn't see nothin'. - Sure. I did.

654
01:12:41,501 --> 01:12:42,727
桑托斯!
Santos!

655
01:12:52,677 --> 01:12:54,108
是不是他們有密謀？
Is there a contract?

656
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:58,180
咱們有過約定: 彼此互相提供消息
We had a deal once; We'd tip each other off if we heard.

657
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,377
我知道，我還記得
I know. I remember.

658
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,085
那麼？
Well?

659
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:11,089
我沒收到任何風聲
I heard of nothing.

660
01:13:15,564 --> 01:13:16,790
謝了
Thanks.

661
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,996
小賽，親愛的，是你嗎？
Sail', honey, is that you?

662
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:00,967
正是我!
The one and only!

663
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:05,803
- 拿到機油了嗎，親愛的？  - 是的，先生!           
D'you get that oil, baby? - Yes siree!

664
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:08,375
我遇到一個叫賴的家伙，他開修車檔
I met a guy called Red. He owns a garage.

665
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:16,841
什麼味道？
What's that smell?

666
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:19,751
我吐了
I barfed.

667
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:25,755
我原來想去廁所吐，結果卻撞錯門
I tried to make it to the bathroom, but it was the wrong door.

668
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:31,158
可能是長途跋涉讓我作嘔，親愛的
I think all this driving is upsetting me, baby.

669
01:14:32,032 --> 01:14:34,123
你覺得我們能在這兒待上幾天，休息一下嗎？
D'you think we could stay here and rest a couple of days?

670
01:14:34,735 --> 01:14:36,530
你暈車，對不對？
Are you carsick, sweetheart?

671
01:14:39,006 --> 01:14:40,562
我猜是有點
A little, I guess.

672
01:14:55,487 --> 01:14:56,975
賽勒，親愛的:
Oh Sailor, honey;

673
01:14:59,124 --> 01:15:04,253
我希望那個女孩的死不會叫我們倒霉運
I hope seeing that girl die didn't jinx us.

674
01:15:16,506 --> 01:15:18,267
我給你買了這個
I got this for you.

675
01:15:20,777 --> 01:15:22,743
它有40種不同的味道
It has 40 different flavors.

676
01:15:23,613 --> 01:15:26,079
每一種都代表我愛你的一個理由
One for about every reason I love you.

677
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,642
小賽，我會好好珍藏
Sail', I'm gonna save this.

678
01:15:33,087 --> 01:15:35,053
即使我喫它
But if I ever eat it,

679
01:15:35,623 --> 01:15:37,919
喫的時候我也會記著你
I'll be thinking of you.

680
01:15:57,076 --> 01:16:01,875
"一輛汽車在118號公路發生車禍，司機羅伯特•布蘭登
"Robert Brenton and two passengers, William Reese

681
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:07,105

682
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:06,883
及車上兩名乘客，威廉•瑞斯和茱莉•戴全部喪生"
and Julie Day, were killed when his car crashed on Highway 118."

683
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:09,575
布蘭登那個該死的笨蛋
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck!

684
01:16:10,955 --> 01:16:14,411
那笨蛋蠢得要命，活該要死
That stupid shit was so dumb,he deserved to die!

685
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:16,548
王八羔子!
That asshole!

686
01:16:19,928 --> 01:16:23,521
蒂米，4號房在搞什麼鬼，整天亮著燈？
Timmy, what's going on in No. 4, where them lights are always on?

687
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:31,298
他們在拍色情片，德州風味!
Them are making a pornographic movie, Texas style!

688
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:33,563
怎麼，想客串一下？
You wanna join in?

689
01:16:37,947 --> 01:16:42,575
在金槍魚鎮混，就得多點幽默感
To survive in Big Tuna, you need an active sense of humor!

690
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:59,125
這位是波斯•史布，我們叫他"老史"
This is Bosis Spool. We call him "DO Spool".

691
01:16:59,732 --> 01:17:00,992
他是位火箭科學家!
The man is a rocket scientist!

692
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:11,102
我的狗在叫
My dog barks some.

693
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:24,215
你在腦子裡想像它是什麼樣的
Mentally, you picture my dog,

694
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:27,518
可是，我還沒告訴你
but, I have not told you

695
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:32,149
它是什麼種的
the type of dog which I have.

696
01:17:35,296 --> 01:17:38,730
也許你會想到
Perhaps you might even picture Toto

697
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:41,864
《綠野仙蹤》裡那隻狗托托
from the "Wizard of Oz".

698
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:53,607
但是我可以告訴你們，我的狗一直跟我在一起
But I can tell you my dog is always with me.

699
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,545
嗨，伙計們好!
Hey everybody!

700
01:18:32,782 --> 01:18:34,372
波比! 嗨，賽勒，露拉
Bobby! Hey, Sailor, Lula,

701
01:18:35,218 --> 01:18:38,947
我跟你們說的就是他! 波比，這是賽勒和露拉
This is the man himself! Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula,

702
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:41,610
兩位剛從外地來  
the 2 most recent strandees,

703
01:18:42,256 --> 01:18:43,778
手頭也不怎麼寬裕
of the economic variety.

704
01:18:45,126 --> 01:18:48,218
波比•佩魯，我喜歡這地方
Bobby Peru. Like the country.

705
01:18:48,997 --> 01:18:51,224
波比幾天前纔到這兒
Bobby just rolled into town a few days ago.

706
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,992
現在再也沒有出現像波比這麼叫人興奮的人物了
Yeah, Bobby is the most exciting item

707
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,762
嘿，自1986年那場
to hit Big Tuna since the '86 cyclone

708
01:18:57,338 --> 01:18:59,270
掀掉中學屋頂的龍卷風以後
sheared the roof off the high school.

709
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:03,570
你是德州人嗎，佩魯先生？
You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

710
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:07,977
我四海為家
I'm from all over.

711
01:19:11,484 --> 01:19:13,040
你在海軍陸戰隊待過
You were in the Marines.

712
01:19:17,889 --> 01:19:19,354
四年
Four years.

713
01:19:20,258 --> 01:19:23,622
- 波比之前在朝阪待過 - 朝阪是什麼？       
Bobby was at Cao Ben. - What's Cao Ben?

714
01:19:25,662 --> 01:19:28,924
- 你多大了？  - 20       
How old are you? - Twenty.

715
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:40,565
許多老弱婦幼都死在朝阪
A lot of women and kids and old people died at Cao Ben.

716
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:46,711
當時是在一艘船上，兄弟
You was on a ship, partner.

717
01:19:47,915 --> 01:19:50,107
當你在越南北部東京灣裡漂浮時
Pretty hard to make contact with the people,

718
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,811
很難和人有接觸
when you're out floating in the Golf of Tonkin.

719
01:19:56,056 --> 01:19:58,147
來吧，波比，再來一杯催情劑
Come on Bobby, have another glass of Jack.

720
01:20:03,564 --> 01:20:05,860
我倒不介意喝一杯
Don't mind if I fuckin' do.

721
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:17,964
提到做那事  
Speakin' of Jack ...

722
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:26,247
有首歌唱得好: 對面的女孩躺下來，躺下來  
One-eyed Jack's yearning to go peeping in a seafood store ...

723
01:20:32,724 --> 01:20:33,916
好了
Alright.

724
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,955
很高興認識你們
Nice meetin' you.

725
01:20:44,267 --> 01:20:46,528
- 祝你們平安，伙計們 - 再見，波比        
Adios, boys! - See ya, Bobby!

726
01:20:48,603 --> 01:20:50,364
波比就喜歡這個  
Bobby's got a way ...

727
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,838
沒法讓他腦子不想那玩意兒
Can't shake that institution out of him.

728
01:20:57,579 --> 01:21:01,910
寶貝，我還是覺得不大舒服，我去睡了
Baby, I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.

729
01:21:02,549 --> 01:21:05,311
- 你也來嗎？      - 好的，我跟你回去
Will you come with me? - Yeah, I'll come along.

730
01:21:07,954 --> 01:21:09,043
就這樣  
Well ...

731
01:21:10,725 --> 01:21:13,021
- 晚安! - 晚安!
Good night! - Good night!

732
01:21:38,582 --> 01:21:40,843
老天，剛纔是怎麼回事？
Lordy, what was that about?

733
01:21:42,386 --> 01:21:43,908
不清楚  
I don't know ...

734
01:22:01,503 --> 01:22:04,299
媽的，那股酸味還沒散
Man, that barf smell don't fade fast.

735
01:22:05,741 --> 01:22:07,070
我能為你做些什麼？
Is there anything I can do for you?

736
01:22:08,943 --> 01:22:11,000
我想沒有，小賽
I don't think so, Sail'.

737
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:14,239
我隻想躺下
I just need to lie down.

738
01:22:48,278 --> 01:22:49,709
知道嗎？
You know what?

739
01:22:51,214 --> 01:22:53,180
我明白你不大喜歡這裡
I know you ain't too pleased being here.

740
01:22:58,988 --> 01:23:00,419
不是這樣
It's not that.

741
01:23:08,662 --> 01:23:10,150
我要把它寫下來
I'm gonna write it down,

742
01:23:12,032 --> 01:23:14,123
我沒法說出口
because I can't say it.

743
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:18,095
沒法說出口？
You can't say it?

744
01:23:21,074 --> 01:23:23,700
對，我說不了
I can't say this, not out loud.

745
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:36,485
"我懷孕了"
I'M PREGNANT.

746
01:23:43,528 --> 01:23:44,925
老天!
Oh God!

747
01:23:52,503 --> 01:23:54,264
對我來說沒問題，親愛的
It's okay by me, Peanut.

748
01:23:55,904 --> 01:23:59,531
不是針對你  
Well, nothing personal ...

749
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:02,235
但我不敢肯定，是不是對我也沒問題
But I ain't so sure it's okay by me.

750
01:24:05,215 --> 01:24:08,444
真的，小賽，我不是說你有什麼不好
Really, Sail', it's nothing against you, baby.

751
01:24:09,617 --> 01:24:10,877
我愛你啊
I love you.

752
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:14,549
我也愛你
I love you too.

753
01:24:15,623 --> 01:24:16,883
我知道
I know.

754
01:24:21,094 --> 01:24:24,994
隻是自從我們在黃磚路拋錨後
I'm just sort of uncomfortable about how things are going,

755
01:24:26,633 --> 01:24:31,067
發生的一切讓我難受
since we broke down along that Yellow Brick Road,

756
01:24:31,604 --> 01:24:35,038
而懷孕也沒法給我安慰
and this doesn't soothe me.

757
01:24:38,109 --> 01:24:41,076
親愛的，我保證不會讓事情變得更糟
Honey, I promise I ain't gonna let things get no worse.

758
01:24:47,586 --> 01:24:49,484
我發誓
Not in a million years.

759
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:29,683
嗨，美人兒，賽勒在嗎？
Hey, pretty woman. Is Sailor here?

760
01:25:30,223 --> 01:25:33,485
- 不，他在給我們的車換機油 - 我尿急                 
No, he's changing oil out in our car. - I gotta take a piss, bad,

761
01:25:34,059 --> 01:25:36,150
能借你的頭用一下嗎？
can I use your head?

762
01:25:37,362 --> 01:25:38,451
啊  我想可以
Oh ... yeah, I guess.

763
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:42,660
我不是真的指你的頭  我當然不會尿在你頭上
I don't mean your head head ... I'm not goin' to piss on your hair,

764
01:25:43,201 --> 01:25:45,292
隻是借一下廁所
just gonna piss in the toilet.

765
01:25:46,304 --> 01:25:51,365
仔細聽好，波比•佩魯的泉水叮咚響
Ya'll take a listen, you'll hear a deep sound comin' from Bobby Peru!

766
01:26:09,326 --> 01:26:12,418
這屋子有股嘔吐後的味道
There's a smell in this room of puke.

767
01:26:13,663 --> 01:26:15,458
是你吐的？
Have you been puking?

768
01:26:18,566 --> 01:26:19,895
你病了？
Are you sick?

769
01:26:21,536 --> 01:26:24,162
- 懷孕了？    - 廁所借完了，你可以走了
Pregnant?   - You used the toilet, now go!

770
01:26:24,772 --> 01:26:27,136
我做什麼與你無關
It ain't none of your business what I do around here!

771
01:26:27,841 --> 01:26:30,899
我就喜歡有你這樣一對寶貝的女人
I sure do like a woman with nice tits like yours,

772
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:35,435
說話兇巴巴，干起事來像兔子
who talks tough and looks like she can fuck like a bunny.

773
01:26:36,049 --> 01:26:37,309
你在床上是這樣嗎？
Can you fuck like that?

774
01:26:38,918 --> 01:26:41,214
干起來像兔子？
You like it like a bunny?

775
01:26:42,588 --> 01:26:46,522
要是這樣，小妞，我會叫你更爽
'Cause if you do, baby, I'll fuck you good,

776
01:26:47,093 --> 01:26:50,549
像大野兔一樣，在洞裡亂跳
like a big old jack-rabbit, jump all around that hole!

777
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:54,387
波比的功夫是一流的
Bobby Peru don't come up for air!

778
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,665
滾出去!
Get out!

779
01:26:58,736 --> 01:27:00,531
我讓你害怕了？
Am I scarin' you?

780
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:05,006
你下面濕了？
Is your pussy wet?

781
01:27:07,278 --> 01:27:08,743
濕了沒有？
Is it wet?

782
01:27:11,749 --> 01:27:13,510
噢，你跳得這麼慢
Oh, don't jump back so slow.

783
01:27:14,084 --> 01:27:17,518
我還以為你是隻兔子，兔子跳得很快
I thought you was a bunny! Bunnies jump fast.

784
01:27:18,521 --> 01:27:20,612
但你這麼慢
You jump back slow.

785
01:27:21,924 --> 01:27:23,856
是某種暗示，對嗎？
Means something, don't it?

786
01:27:25,561 --> 01:27:27,459
你在對我暗示
Means something to me.

787
01:27:28,697 --> 01:27:30,924
你想要波比
Means you want Bobby Peru.

788
01:27:31,766 --> 01:27:34,528
你要波比把你干得天昏地暗，小妞
You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard, baby,

789
01:27:35,069 --> 01:27:37,330
像開聖誕禮物一樣把你弄開
to open you like a Christmas present!

790
01:27:38,705 --> 01:27:44,106
你要我做嗎？ 隻需回答"要"或者"不要"
You want me to do it? Just a simple "yes" or "no".

791
01:27:44,611 --> 01:27:46,975
好好享受一下我和你的第一次親密接觸
Just feel me breathin' on ya.

792
01:27:48,148 --> 01:27:52,707
- 你就知道我在床上很行  - 滾出去              
And you know I mean business when it comes to fuckin' ! - Out!

793
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,081
波比會抓住你  
Bobby Peru will grab ya ...

794
01:27:58,289 --> 01:27:59,948
把你緊緊抱住  
hold ya tight ...

795
01:28:00,593 --> 01:28:02,354
好好嘗嘗你裡面的味道
feel everythin' in ya.

796
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,425
閉嘴
Be quiet!

797
01:28:05,362 --> 01:28:06,691
說"操我"
Say "Fuck me".

798
01:28:07,731 --> 01:28:09,492
- 我就走     - 沒門，快給我滾!
Then I'll leave.  - No way. Get out!

799
01:28:10,433 --> 01:28:14,299
說! 我會把你的心挖出來的，小妞
Say it! I'll tear your fuckin' heart out, girl!

800
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:16,529
說"操我"
Say "Fuck me".

801
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:18,605
快說
Say "Fuck me"!

802
01:28:19,209 --> 01:28:21,971
然後我就走，說"操我"
Then I'll go. Say "Fuck me"!

803
01:28:22,613 --> 01:28:24,545
小聲地，說出來!
Whisper it. Say it!

804
01:28:25,815 --> 01:28:27,644
說，說!
Say it. Say it!

805
01:28:29,218 --> 01:28:30,740
說"操我"
Say "Fuck me".

806
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:33,619
小聲說"操我"
Whisper it. "Fuck me".

807
01:28:34,991 --> 01:28:38,355
"操我"，說啊
"Fuck me". Say "Fuck me".

808
01:29:17,193 --> 01:29:19,853
改天吧，寶貝，今天我還有事
Some day honey, I will! But I gotta get goin' !

809
01:29:24,501 --> 01:29:26,967
拜托別哭了  
Sing! Don't cry ...

810
01:30:06,204 --> 01:30:07,601
嗨，波比
Hi Bobby!

811
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,353
- 要幫忙嗎？     - 謝謝，快做完了
You need a hand?  - Thanks, but I'm about done.

812
01:30:30,293 --> 01:30:31,588
去喝杯啤酒如何？
How about a beer?

813
01:30:33,295 --> 01:30:34,760
啤酒  
A beer ...

814
01:30:36,332 --> 01:30:37,421
那好  
Well, ...

815
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:40,923
好吧，波比，我去
Yeah, Bobby, that'd be fine.

816
01:30:44,507 --> 01:30:46,473
你那位俊俏的小姑娘今天在哪？
Where is your pretty little lady today?

817
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:53,802
在房間裡休息，最近身體不大舒服
She's up in our room, restin'. Hasn't been feelin' well lately.

818
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:56,880
真遺憾
Sorry to hear it.

819
01:31:40,989 --> 01:31:44,650
我去羅波鎮探過底了
I've been studying a situation over in Lobo.

820
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,351
要兩個人纔能干成
Take two men to handle it.

821
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,659
干什麼？
What's that?

822
01:31:54,302 --> 01:31:57,598
一家飼料店，保險箱裡藏著五千美金
A feed store, keeps up to 5 K in their safe.

823
01:31:58,204 --> 01:32:01,262
我要個醒目的小伙子斷後，五五分帳
Need me a good boy for backup. Even split.

824
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:03,997
怎麼樣？
Interested?

825
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:07,000
不，朋友
No, man.

826
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:11,904
我想不行
I don't think so.

827
01:32:13,786 --> 01:32:15,581
輕而易舉就能搞定的，賽勒
It'll be easy, Sailor.

828
01:32:16,188 --> 01:32:22,284
我會讓兩個職員乖乖打開保險箱，你看好門
Two employees. I take 'em in back to open the safe. You cover the door.

829
01:32:29,533 --> 01:32:32,261
你不是忙活著想在金槍魚鎮
You ain't plannin' on raisin'

830
01:32:32,335 --> 01:32:35,063
成家立業嗎？
a family in the Big Tuna, are you?

831
01:32:37,072 --> 01:32:39,333
等一等  
Wait a minute ...

832
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:42,372
你在說什麼成家立業？
What'd you mean by family?

833
01:32:43,579 --> 01:32:44,874
我隻是說  
Well, I mean ...

834
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,578
和露拉  
with Lula ...

835
01:32:50,418 --> 01:32:52,782
小兩口過得有個家的樣子，沒別的意思
being in a family way and all.

836
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:57,989
露拉告訴你她懷孕了嗎？
Did Lula tell you she was pregnant?

837
01:32:58,894 --> 01:33:01,690
手裡攥著幾千塊,你們就不用過苦日子
Couple of grand or two sure would help you two out.

838
01:33:02,264 --> 01:33:05,720
可以離開這鬼地方，到墨西哥或者其他什麼地方，隻要有錢
Get you out West, to Mexico, or anywhere with a few dollars to spare.

839
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:10,326
我都替你們經算好了，賽勒
I've got it figured out good.

840
01:33:11,638 --> 01:33:14,628
你什麼時候跟露拉說過話？
When did you talk to Lula?

841
01:33:17,477 --> 01:33:19,875
今天下午
I talked to her this afternoon,

842
01:33:23,481 --> 01:33:25,071
你不在的時候
when you was out.

843
01:33:31,721 --> 01:33:35,485
她真的親口跟你說她懷孕了？
Did she really say she was pregnant?

844
01:33:38,261 --> 01:33:40,853
我瞎猜罷了，就這麼回事
I just took a guess, that's all.

845
01:33:42,498 --> 01:33:44,464
你到底參不參加？
You in or out on this deal?

846
01:33:48,504 --> 01:33:50,800
我他媽的還不清楚，波比
I ain't fucking sure, Bobby.

847
01:33:53,475 --> 01:33:55,667
別考慮太久
Don't take too long to think about it.

848
01:34:08,155 --> 01:34:09,450
喝夠了？
Had enough?

849
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:12,988
夠了!
Have now!

850
01:34:16,129 --> 01:34:18,595
跟我出去一下，有好東西給你瞧
Let's go outside. I have something to show you.

851
01:34:22,134 --> 01:34:24,760
這是一把鋸短的
Right here is a double-barreled, sawed-off

852
01:34:25,404 --> 01:34:26,835
雙管獵槍
Ithica shotgun.

853
01:34:28,473 --> 01:34:29,562
旁邊那把
Next to it;

854
01:34:30,107 --> 01:34:35,839
是槍管4汲イ牡閎八手槍
a Smith & Wesson .38 handgun with a 4-inch barrel.

855
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:47,777
有了這些家伙
Those'll do her,

856
01:34:48,424 --> 01:34:50,616
那五千塊錢就能輕松入袋
really loosen up that 5 grand.

857
01:34:51,493 --> 01:34:54,085
你和小姑娘拿一半
Two and a half for you and the little lady.

858
01:34:55,964 --> 01:34:58,362
你身上還剩多少？
How much money you got left?

859
01:35:00,368 --> 01:35:02,027
40塊  
Forty bucks ...

860
01:35:02,804 --> 01:35:04,770
兄弟，這筆錢轉眼就能賺到
This is easy money, partner.

861
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:07,668
也不會讓任何人受傷
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

862
01:35:08,874 --> 01:35:11,340
這麼個大好機會，你不會讓它白白溜走
And I don't think you can afford to pass it up ...

863
01:35:14,246 --> 01:35:18,271
明早10點，我的車在旅館後面等你
I'll bring the Eldorado to the back of the motel at 10 AM.

864
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:23,513
肯定能叫你和小姑娘過上舒服的小日子
Really could set you and that little lady up good.

865
01:35:27,461 --> 01:35:29,017
是啊，我想是可以
Yeah, I guess so.

866
01:35:30,162 --> 01:35:31,718
這筆錢
That kinda money

867
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:37,264
可以讓我們在黃磚路上走下去
will get us a long way down that Yellow Brick Road.

868
01:35:39,371 --> 01:35:42,964
但是真該死，你得保證到時可別出什麼差池
But damn it, this better go real smooth, you understand me?

869
01:35:43,574 --> 01:35:46,700
簡直就像囊中探物一樣保險
Like taking candy from a baby.

870
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:00,052
賽勒來了
Here comes Sailor.

871
01:36:33,787 --> 01:36:35,685
你喝酒了？
You've been drinkin', huh?

872
01:36:36,889 --> 01:36:38,479
幾杯啤酒而已
A few beers is all.

873
01:36:41,059 --> 01:36:42,456
感覺好點沒？
Feelin' any better?

874
01:36:43,294 --> 01:36:45,089
還不清楚
Can't tell yet.

875
01:36:51,969 --> 01:36:54,060
還是滿屋子那股味道
That smell's still filling this room good.

876
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:02,108
你剛纔說你去哪兒了？
So where d'you say you was?

877
01:37:06,782 --> 01:37:08,873
和波比出去了
I went with Bobby.

878
01:37:15,756 --> 01:37:16,845
小賽
Sail'?

879
01:37:20,259 --> 01:37:21,485
我們離開這裡吧
Let's leave here.

880
01:37:22,262 --> 01:37:23,227
我們會的，心肝
We are, Peanut.

881
01:37:27,799 --> 01:37:28,888
很快
Real soon.

882
01:37:43,181 --> 01:37:46,148
你和波比那家伙在一起混？
You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru?

883
01:37:48,154 --> 01:37:50,086
我能混什麼？
What could I be up to?

884
01:38:02,598 --> 01:38:06,032
那個波比是人面獸心，小賽
That Bobby Peru is a black angel, Sail'.

885
01:38:08,036 --> 01:38:10,764
要是你跟他鬼混，你要後悔的  
You hook up with him and you'll regret it ...

886
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,501
後悔一輩子
If you live to.

887
01:38:14,475 --> 01:38:15,997
多謝你的提醒，親愛的
Thanks, darling.

888
01:38:17,812 --> 01:38:20,608
我知道你為我著想
I know you got my interests in mind,

889
01:38:21,182 --> 01:38:23,307
我非常感激
and I appreciate it sincerely.

890
01:38:24,552 --> 01:38:27,018
我愛你，但是我得睡了
I love you, but I got to get some sleep now.

891
01:38:29,223 --> 01:38:34,318
這個世界內心狂野，頭腦發熱
This whole world is wild at heart ... and weird on top.

892
01:38:43,903 --> 01:38:46,369
我盼著你能對我唱"柔情似水"
I wish you'd sing me "Love me tender".

893
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:51,939
我真希望我們是在那彩虹之上
Oh, I wish I was somewhere over that rainbow.

894
01:38:53,745 --> 01:38:55,142
一切全是狗屁!
It's just shit!

895
01:38:56,714 --> 01:38:58,680
狗屁! 狗屁! 狗屁!
Shit, shit, shit!

896
01:39:42,888 --> 01:39:44,717
這是全家福？
The whole gang, huh?

897
01:39:45,357 --> 01:39:46,253
沒錯
Yes.

898
01:39:50,561 --> 01:39:53,823
知道嗎，你真人看起來要漂亮得多
You know, you look a whole lot better in the flesh.

899
01:39:57,767 --> 01:40:00,063
一切都按計劃進行
The cobra is waitin' to strike, Chica.

900
01:40:01,205 --> 01:40:02,932
你認識那個叫賽勒的家伙？
You know that guy, Sailor?

901
01:40:03,474 --> 01:40:05,440
前幾天他來過這兒
He came by the other afternoon.

902
01:40:06,143 --> 01:40:09,405
- 想打聽是不是有人想殺他 - 真的？                 
He wanted to know if there was a contract on him. - No shit?

903
01:40:10,847 --> 01:40:13,074
- 你認識他？ - 以前認識.
You know him? - I used to.

904
01:40:13,717 --> 01:40:16,343
- 你怎麼回答？. - 當然是"沒有"
What did you say? - "No", of course.

905
01:40:17,086 --> 01:40:18,642
沒錯
That's right.

906
01:40:20,456 --> 01:40:23,423
不過他很快就會倒大霉
He could have a bad accident, though.

907
01:40:28,096 --> 01:40:29,322
在一宗搶劫之前
Before,

908
01:40:29,831 --> 01:40:31,797
或是之中，要不就是之後
during or after a hold-up.

909
01:40:43,609 --> 01:40:45,268
我到底在這兒做什麼？
What am I doing here?

910
01:40:52,418 --> 01:40:54,679
賽勒，你到底在這兒做什麼？
Sailor, what are you doing here?

911
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:00,421
我不能干
I can't do this.

912
01:41:12,536 --> 01:41:13,659
坐到後面去
Climb in back!

913
01:41:15,638 --> 01:41:17,126
她在這裡干什麼？
What the hell's she doin' here?

914
01:41:17,674 --> 01:41:21,472
她是我女人，給我們開車，你不喜歡？
She's my girl. She's drivin'. That bother you?

915
01:41:22,044 --> 01:41:23,100
快上車
Jump in!

916
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:24,802
你欠我一人情
You owe me one.

917
01:41:25,447 --> 01:41:27,538
來吧，大膽先生
Come on, Mr. Big Round Balls,

918
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:31,278
我們去賺點容易到手的錢
let's go and make us some easy money.

919
01:41:37,693 --> 01:41:40,125
俗話說得好: 星期五都是黑色的
They say the eagle flies on Friday.

920
01:43:38,934 --> 01:43:40,763
把絲襪戴上
Get that mask on!

921
01:43:41,837 --> 01:43:44,565
別熄火，我們去去就來
Keep it revvin', Chiquita. We'll be right back!

922
01:43:45,272 --> 01:43:47,204
我們說好不傷人，別忘了
Nobody's gonna get hurt. Remember that!

923
01:43:48,442 --> 01:43:49,839
好的，兄弟
Right, partner!

924
01:44:02,322 --> 01:44:03,787
行了，伙計們
Okay, boys!

925
01:44:04,357 --> 01:44:07,153
到後面去，兩個都到後面去
Get in the back! Get into the back! Now! Both of you!

926
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:12,889
如果有人進來，把他們也推過來，手腳要利索
If anyone comes in, herd 'em back here quick.

927
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:16,090
好的，別把事情搞糟就行
Alright, let's make this nice and easy!

928
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:43,388
你在等人嗎？
You waitin' for somebody?

929
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,357
我丈夫
My husband.

930
01:44:48,063 --> 01:44:50,689
他在飼料店
He's in the feed store.

931
01:44:55,002 --> 01:44:58,936
小心煙頭燒到手，女士
Well, watch that cigarette, ma'am. It's about to burn down to your fingers.

932
01:44:59,539 --> 01:45:01,766
謝謝，長官
Thank you, officer.

933
01:45:03,176 --> 01:45:06,041
以前沒見過你，你是本地人？
I haven't seen you before. Are you from Lobo?

934
01:45:07,212 --> 01:45:08,108
不是
No.

935
01:45:09,082 --> 01:45:10,513
過來
Over here!

936
01:45:12,251 --> 01:45:13,716
金槍魚鎮上的？
Big Tuna, huh?

937
01:45:14,286 --> 01:45:16,752
- 開車路不近啊，對不對？  - 對                  
That's quite a drive, isn't it?  - Yes.

938
01:45:17,388 --> 01:45:18,444
咱們走吧!
Let's go!

939
01:45:19,423 --> 01:45:20,319
笑一笑
Say "Cheese".

940
01:45:23,426 --> 01:45:24,515
別動
Stay put!

941
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:31,531
別衝動，朋友
Cool it, man!

942
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:35,635
下一個就是你了，混蛋
You're next, fucker!

943
01:45:47,815 --> 01:45:51,249
那些都是笨蛋
Those are dummies, dummy!

944
01:45:57,158 --> 01:45:59,522
你有種就過來，神槍手
Step up here, hotshot!

945
01:46:00,093 --> 01:46:02,354
我會叫你滿地找你那口爛牙
I'll slap that smile right off your face!

946
01:46:22,948 --> 01:46:24,504
站住，你們這班王八蛋
Stop, you sons of bitches!

947
01:46:26,117 --> 01:46:28,015
警察! 站住，要不我開槍了
This is the police! Hold it or I'll shoot!

948
01:46:42,197 --> 01:46:43,320
噢，老天
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

949
01:46:46,468 --> 01:46:48,093
那個王八蛋
That poor bastard.

950
01:46:50,172 --> 01:46:51,694
把手放到頭上，牛仔
Hands behind your head, cowboy!

951
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:58,809
露拉，我這次真的叫你失望了
Lula, I really let you down this time.

952
01:47:00,847 --> 01:47:02,107
我的心肝
Peanut!

953
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:04,542
快幫我找那該死的雜碎
Look for the damned thing!

954
01:47:05,152 --> 01:47:09,917
會找到的，醫生會給你縫上
We'll find it, they sew them things back on.

955
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:11,921
將來又可完好如初
Works good as new.

956
01:47:12,493 --> 01:47:14,425
找不到，那該死的雜碎到底在哪？
I can't find it. Where is the damned thing?

957
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:16,551
一定在這附近
It's gotta be here somewhere.

958
01:47:44,421 --> 01:47:47,855
打擾一下，我找770378號
Pardon me. I'm lookin' for 770378.

959
01:48:01,736 --> 01:48:03,201
小賽，寶貝
Sailor, baby!

960
01:48:33,431 --> 01:48:38,991
我的天! 我的天!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

961
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:43,766
心肝寶貝，終於找到你了
My baby, sweetest one. Oh, sweetheart.

962
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,671
媽媽這就帶你回家
Mama's gonna take you home. We're gonna go home.

963
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:49,108
桑托斯會幫我們的忙
Santos is gonna help us.

964
01:48:49,713 --> 01:48:55,148
搭我們到聖安東尼奧機場
He's gonna take us to the airport in San Antonio.

965
01:48:55,751 --> 01:48:58,343
- 沒事了，寶貝 - 不     - 沒事了     
It's OK, baby. - No ... - Yes.

966
01:49:00,088 --> 01:49:01,644
來吧，我們得走了
Come! We're gonna go.

967
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:03,619
- 沒事了 - 媽媽   - 干嘛？.
It's OK. - Mama! - Yes?

968
01:49:04,258 --> 01:49:07,487
賽勒出事了，我不能就這樣撇下他
Sailor's in deep trouble here. I can't just leave him.

969
01:49:07,995 --> 01:49:11,190
怎麼不能？
Oh yes, you can!

970
01:49:11,765 --> 01:49:14,357
你當然可以
Yes, you can!

971
01:49:19,405 --> 01:49:21,997
你媽媽真的很擔心你
Your mama was real worried about you, honey.

972
01:49:23,209 --> 01:49:24,640
我也是
Me too.

973
01:49:27,314 --> 01:49:29,678
不介意擁抱一下你的老朋友桑托斯吧
Can you give your old friend Santos a hug?

974
01:49:40,792 --> 01:49:42,451
最親愛的賽勒
Dearest Sailor,

975
01:49:43,294 --> 01:49:46,728
我想讓你知道的第一件事， 是我留住了孩子
First thing you'll want to know is; I'm keeping the baby.

976
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:50,856
媽媽開始反對，現在估計也是
Mama wasn't for it at first, but I think now she is.

977
01:49:51,468 --> 01:49:56,369
我叫他佩思，不管是男孩還是女孩
I'm gonna name it Pace, no matter if it's a boy or a girl.

978
01:49:56,906 --> 01:50:02,001
有點難以想像，你出來時佩思已經六歲了
It's kinda hard to believe that Pace will be six when you get out.

979
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:04,974
我們的孩子!
Our child!

980
01:50:05,547 --> 01:50:07,774
我愛你，賽勒
I love you, Sailor.

981
01:50:08,315 --> 01:50:10,747
我想給跟你跳舞說話
I miss dancing and talking,

982
01:50:11,318 --> 01:50:13,375
特別是做那件事!
and especially the other!

983
01:50:17,057 --> 01:50:21,788
5年10個月零21天後
5 YEARS, 10 MONTHS, 21 DAYS LATER

984
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:22,007


985
01:50:22,962 --> 01:50:27,897
賽勒的火車  什麼時候  到？
When ... does ... Sailor's train get in?

986
01:50:29,335 --> 01:50:30,630
六點
Six.

987
01:50:36,308 --> 01:50:39,070
要是我叫你不要去  
If I asked you not to go ...

988
01:50:39,645 --> 01:50:41,611
沒用的
It wouldn't make any difference.

989
01:50:43,081 --> 01:50:46,479
孩子，要是我叫你不要去會怎麼樣？
Girl, what if I told you not to go?

990
01:50:47,485 --> 01:50:50,611
媽媽，如果你想破壞我們的幸福
Mama, if you get in the way of our happiness,

991
01:50:51,154 --> 01:50:53,381
我會把你撕成肉片的!
I'll fucking pull your arms out by the roots!

992
01:51:13,441 --> 01:51:15,236
不許去!
No!

993
01:51:22,716 --> 01:51:25,182
媽媽，你差點跟人撞車呢
Mama, you almost crashed us!

994
01:51:27,454 --> 01:51:29,249
是車禍，寶貝
Oh, an accident, baby!

995
01:51:37,428 --> 01:51:39,326
喔，我的天啊
Oh no, oh man!

996
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,566
去年這種爛事也撞到我頭上
Same fuckin' thing happened to me last year!

997
01:52:43,588 --> 01:52:45,144
你一定是我兒子
You must be my son.

998
01:52:50,061 --> 01:52:52,253
跟你爸爸握握手，兒子
Shake hands with your daddy, Pace.

999
01:52:57,267 --> 01:53:01,395
見到你真榮幸，小伙子，我讀了不少你的事
It's a pleasure to meet you, Pace. I read a lot about you.

1000
01:53:27,128 --> 01:53:28,787
餓了嗎？
Are you hungry?

1001
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:32,925
前面帶路
Lead the way.

1002
01:53:34,134 --> 01:53:35,429
不!
No!

1003
01:53:36,937 --> 01:53:38,129
不!
No!

1004
01:54:01,191 --> 01:54:02,952
怎麼了，媽媽？
What's wrong, Mama?

1005
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,787
別擔心，兒子，在這兒待著
Don't worry, son. Just stay here.

1006
01:54:19,341 --> 01:54:21,602
對不起，賽勒，我忍不住
I'm sorry, Sailor, I just can't help it.

1007
01:54:22,245 --> 01:54:25,701
再等一會，我會沒事的
Just give me one little minute, then I'll quit.

1008
01:54:26,382 --> 01:54:29,644
孩子嚇到了，露拉，這樣不好
The boy's frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.

1009
01:54:32,487 --> 01:54:34,679
真的，賽勒，我會沒事的
Really, Sailor, I'll be okay.

1010
01:54:41,695 --> 01:54:43,524
天意弄人，寶貝
It's a mistake, honey.

1011
01:54:44,163 --> 01:54:47,425
你們倆走吧，我回火車站
You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.

1012
01:54:48,868 --> 01:54:53,166
你胡說些什麼？車裡是你親生兒子
What are you talking about? That's your son in there!

1013
01:54:53,738 --> 01:54:55,499
他不認識我，露拉
He never knew me, Lula.

1014
01:54:56,074 --> 01:54:57,801
所以也應很容易忘掉我
So there's not much for him to forget.

1015
01:54:58,309 --> 01:55:02,539
而且六年不見，分開對我們也很容易
And 6 years apart makes it almost simple for us too.

1016
01:55:04,448 --> 01:55:06,414
你怎麼能說這種話，賽勒？
How can you say that, Sailor?

1017
01:55:08,585 --> 01:55:10,380
這纔合情理
It's what makes sense.

1018
01:55:14,058 --> 01:55:15,956
求你別這麼做，賽勒
Please don't do this, Sailor!

1019
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:20,126
如果你有什麼不順心的事
If ever something
doesn't feel right to you,

1020
01:55:20,763 --> 01:55:22,729
想想牛仔潘喬對四酷小子說的話
remember what Pancho said to the Cisco Kid;

1021
01:55:23,966 --> 01:55:29,367
"在山窮水盡之前，瀟灑走一回"
"Let's win, before we're dancing at the end of a rope, without music."

1022
01:55:43,484 --> 01:55:45,882
沒有我，你過得很好
You've been fine without me.

1023
01:55:46,486 --> 01:55:50,250
沒必要讓日子變得難過
No need to make life tougher than it has to be.

1024
01:56:12,509 --> 01:56:14,566
賽勒，回來
Sailor, come back!

1025
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,437
你們這班基佬想干嘛？
What do you faggots want?

1026
01:58:06,346 --> 01:58:07,469
那個好女巫  
The Good Witch ...

1027
01:58:10,482 --> 01:58:11,879
露拉愛你
Lula loves you.

1028
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:16,478
但我是殺人犯兼強盜
But I'm a robberand a man slaughterer.

1029
01:58:17,055 --> 01:58:19,282
而且沒有受過多少家庭教育
And I haven't had any parental guidance.

1030
01:58:19,891 --> 01:58:22,790
這些她都不在乎
She's forgiven you all that.

1031
01:58:24,127 --> 01:58:27,491
你愛她
You love her.

1032
01:58:28,065 --> 01:58:30,031
別擔心，賽勒
Don't be afraid, Sailor.

1033
01:58:31,301 --> 01:58:34,268
但是我心狂野
But I'm wild at heart.

1034
01:58:34,904 --> 01:58:37,496
如果你真是這樣
If you are truly wild at heart,

1035
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:40,867
那你就會為你的夢想而奮鬥
you'll fight for your dreams.

1036
01:58:45,247 --> 01:58:47,975
別逃避愛情，賽勒
Don't turn away from love, Sailor.

1037
01:58:49,985 --> 01:58:52,281
別逃避愛情
Don't turn away from love.

1038
01:59:20,245 --> 01:59:21,505
嘗夠滋味沒，混蛋？
Had enough, asshole?

1039
01:59:24,447 --> 01:59:25,969
是的，夠了
Yes I have.

1040
01:59:26,783 --> 01:59:28,806
我向你們道歉
And I want to apologize to you gentlemen

1041
01:59:29,352 --> 01:59:31,579
不該叫你們同性戀
for referring to you as homosexuals.

1042
01:59:32,155 --> 01:59:34,553
我還想向你們道謝
I also want to thank you fellows.

1043
01:59:35,158 --> 01:59:38,182
你們教會我人生重要一課
You've taught me a valuable lesson in life.

1044
02:01:08,845 --> 02:01:10,970
我剛遇見那個好女巫
I just met the Good Witch.

1045
02:01:48,277 --> 02:01:58,548
