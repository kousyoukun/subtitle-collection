

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,120
PAT: What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,400
开什么玩笑  星期天？ 我爱星期天

8
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:18,263
每天都盼着星期天

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,720
The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.

10
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:20,249
全家人聚在一起  妈妈做了酒烩肉卷

11
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:22,017
爸爸穿上球衣

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,000
We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes,

13
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:25,419
我们都在看球赛  对  这快把我逼疯了

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,200
I was negative. You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.

15
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:28,776
我很消极  但你不知道我喜欢这些  尼基

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,520
I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before. ?

17
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:31,198
只是过去没有好好珍惜  也没有珍惜你

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,040
Come on. Time to go.

19
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,816
快点  该走了

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,480
I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back.

21
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:38,393
我失去了一切  罪有应得  可你也有错

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,800
We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now.

23
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,542
我们能重新开始

24
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'm gonna appreciate--?

25
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:43,006
我们会重新开始  一切都会好起来

26
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,210
我好多了  希望你也是  我会好好珍惜

27
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?

28
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:48,659
马上就好  好吗

29
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,920
Doctor's waiting. Let's go.

30
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,362
医生等着呢  快走

31
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll be there in a minute.

32
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:52,792
一会儿就到

33
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,560
That's true love.

34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

35
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,312
这是真爱

36
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:09,105
「精进不休」

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,840
DANNY: Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,720
And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far.

39
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:31,990
那时我头发很长  他们说我总讨论发型

40
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,240
He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that.

41
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,979
可我就喜欢那一款  他把这边剪得很短

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,560
I said, Just cut it the way you cut it... . ?

43
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:36,387
只好把另一边多剪点

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,680
PAT: Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible.

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,642
我可没叫他这样剪

46
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,320
I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and

47
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,018
我说的是  就按你上次剪的那样

48
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,220
只要思路对了  一切皆有可能

49
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,160
it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.

50
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,994
我觉得  我们总会陷入消极状态

51
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,944
这是一种毒药  好像什么都无所谓

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,440
DR. TIMBERS:... technically, you can take him out against our recommendation,

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,080
but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court.

54
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:04,025
程序上  您可以不顾我们的忠告把他带走

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
And he's just getting used to the routine here.

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,200
DOLORES: I don't want him to get used to the routine here.

57
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,647
但您将在法律上承担主要责任

58
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,923
况且他刚刚习惯这里的生活

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,240
Eight months is already long enough.

60
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,978
我才不希望他习惯这里的生活

61
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,570
八个月已经够长了

62
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,464
「出院许可」

63
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,498
「院方不承担任何责任」

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,400
PAT: Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,200
DOLORES: What? I don't understand.

66
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:30,595
妈  把丹尼载到费城北区可以吗？

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,160
PAT: Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

68
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,240
DANNY: I guess everybody's leaving today!

69
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,571
什么  为什么？

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,960
Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you. Pat told me all about you,

71
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:36,592
妈  没关系  没关系的

72
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:38,789
我猜大家今天都能出院啊

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds

74
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,384
夫人  您好  终于有幸见到您了

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day

76
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:44,717
帕特常跟我提起您

77
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,120
when the Birds play.

78
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,897
他说您超有个性  简直是家里的顶梁柱

79
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:52,337
做的卤汁面更是一绝

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,360
PAT: Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.

81
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,640
DANNY: Bad combination.

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,520
Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder. That was when I was an X-ray

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,200
technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to

84
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:02,896
丹尼吸毒酗酒时才会打架

85
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:04,214
才不是这么回事

86
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,320
medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long, too.

87
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,200
- 主要还是焦虑症 - 我以前是个放射技师

88
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:12,083
又有焦虑症  有很多机会弄到药

89
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,760
But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my

90
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,440
hair didn't grow because my brother...

91
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:16,390
那时我头发很长

92
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,680
Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,960
I couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long enough.

94
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,755
我年纪大了才开始留头发

95
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,800
I was so jealous of my brother...

96
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:20,701
小时候没留过  因为我哥…

97
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,680
But Wait a minute, Wait a minute. Hello?

98
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,004
我跟你说过  我哥烫过杰里卷

99
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,920
Yeah! It looks great now. You like it?

100
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:25,404
我头发不够长  烫不了

101
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,160
No, It's good now. Yes, it is.

102
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,880
Wait, you're going the wrong way!

103
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:27,310
就很嫉妒他

104
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,720
What? Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away.

105
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,280
- 先等我讲完 - 喂？

106
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,590
- 这样挺好的 - 真的？

107
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,480
You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave.

108
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:31,854
- 现在这样就不错 - 是挺不错

109
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,646
等等  你摸错方向了

110
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:39,741
什么  你确定？ 我这就把他送回去

111
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.

112
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,680
Let's just talk about this.

113
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,800
Mom, just listen-- Don't tou-...

114
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:43,663
你骗我  帕特  丹尼明明不能出院

115
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,080
... -ch the steering... ... wheel!

116
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,320
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.

117
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:45,320
妈  等一下

118
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:46,996
我们谈谈

119
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?

120
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,567
- 妈  听我说 - 别动方向盘  放手！

121
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,360
I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.

122
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,058
帕特  整件事就是个误会

123
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
It's my fault. Pat didn't know. Pat didn't know. He's my friend,

124
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,280
so he was rootin' for me. I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital,

125
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,074
妈妈  对不起  你没事吧？

126
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,880
but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital,

127
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:03,375
我担心法庭会找你麻烦

128
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,000
but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see,

129
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:06,954
都是我的错  和帕特无关  他什么都不知道

130
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,160
he's fine. It's my fault.

131
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:10,556
他只是想帮我  我跟医院有点小矛盾

132
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,520
Mom, can we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.

133
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,265
但我会解决的  送我回医院吧

134
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,516
把帕特带回家  相信我  他真的没事

135
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,480
Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.

136
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:17,817
都是我的错

137
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,156
妈  去一下图书馆行吗？

138
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,393
我想看完尼基高中英文教学大纲上的书

139
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,495
妈  这是好事  我要重新开始

140
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,400
DeSean Jackson. What happened to DeSean Jackson?

141
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,440
Come on, tell me that one.

142
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
It's insanity. He spikes the ball at the one yard line. The one fucking-yard line.

143
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,760
I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.# I mean, he celebrates before he's even in!

144
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:42,208
德肖恩・杰克逊

145
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,594
德肖恩・杰克逊怎么了？

146
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,680
You know something? It's nothing new. Your team does that all the time.

147
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:47,364
快给我讲讲

148
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,925
简直疯了  他在一码线掷地球

149
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,480
They get close...... and then they blow it. They got an inferiority complex.

150
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:52,014
该死的一码线

151
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What makes the Cowboys America's Team?

152
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,945
然后他就进了球门区  蠢货

153
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,960
Because we are, we're America's Team.

154
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,031
没什么好奇怪的  你们队总这样

155
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
You should be ashamed of yourself. We're in Philadelphia,

156
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,840
what's the matter with you? You're a fucking traitor.

157
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:04,117
每次只要一追平  立刻就能搞砸  扶不起来

158
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,200
What's more American than a cowboy?

159
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,520
You know what's more American? What?

160
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:08,361
瞎说  你们牛仔队凭什么自称美国之队？

161
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American.

162
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,320
Benjamin Franklin?

163
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,713
我们本来就是美国之队

164
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,960
Benjamin Franklin. The founder of our country, here in Philadelphia.

165
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
You mean the guy with the... ... little glasses and the long scraggly hair?

166
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:12,296
你害不害臊  我们可是费城人

167
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,520
What about the lightning with the kite? He stood in the storm with a kite.

168
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:13,698
搞什么呢  你个叛徒

169
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:16,183
还有什么比牛仔更能代表美国？

170
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,080
If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody... ... would even know who he is.

171
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:17,657
- 你知道什么叫真正的美国人吗？- 什么？

172
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,572
本杰明・富兰克林  那才是真正的美国人

173
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,440
What are you doing? No, no, no, no. Don't touch them, don't touch them.

174
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:20,470
本杰明・富兰克林？

175
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,320
I didn't even touch em. Why are you--, don't blame me.

176
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,317
对  他就是在这  在费城缔造了我们国家

177
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,080
Who did this? Who took, who took, who took the...

178
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,165
你是说那个戴着小眼镜  头发乱糟糟的家伙？

179
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,720
the remotes like this? Did you do this, Randy?

180
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:28,254
那风筝实验呢  他是冒着暴风雨做的实验

181
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,200
No, I dont touch them. As a matter of fact, I dont know why you need so many.

182
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:30,191
他要不是家财万贯

183
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,783
压根就没人知道他

184
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,920
Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful!

185
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:34,140
你在干什么  别碰它们

186
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,482
我没碰  少怪到我头上

187
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,880
What!! Whats this?

188
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:37,965
那是谁干的  谁拿了…

189
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,685
像这样的遥控器  是你吗  兰迪？

190
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:45,367
没有  我都不知道你怎么那么多遥控器

191
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,920
Everything good? Mm-hmm.

192
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:49,251
看  美女回来了！

193
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Ahh.

194
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,281
什么  怎么回事？

195
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,400
Where is it? It's right here.

196
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,000
You got it. Ahh, well, we got that. We don't want them to steal that.

197
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,480
You still got yours? Yeah, I got mine.

198
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,735
你还好吗？

199
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,720
So what, you don't talk to me? You didn't tell me you took him out.

200
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
Well, he's ready. Look at him.

201
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,040
You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?

202
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:09,551
- 那个还在吧？- 在这呢

203
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,360
Don't worry about that. I wanna make sure when you come out

204
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,305
还在  很好  我们还怕让人偷了呢

205
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,000
that you're okay, and she didn't say anything.

206
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,200
You didn't tell me? The court said yes. Don't worry.

207
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:14,989
- 你的呢？- 我的也在

208
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,040
Yeah, but what did the doctor say? Because the, the court listens to the doctor.

209
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:20,316
你怎么不跟我商量  你没说要接他出来

210
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,480
Yeah, and the court said- The court listens to the doctor, the doctor-

211
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,161
他已经好了  你看他的样子

212
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,080
Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go.

213
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:23,802
你没告诉爸要接我出来？

214
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:26,204
- 别管这些了 - 我只是想确定…

215
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,640
Don't worry.

216
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,942
你已经完全好了  她什么都没跟我说

217
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,920
Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago.

218
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:32,291
- 你干嘛不告诉我？- 法庭同意了  别担心

219
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,760
It was a plea bargain with the courts.

220
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:36,291
医生怎么说  法庭得听医生的意见

221
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,360
The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and

222
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,760
then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.

223
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,859
- 没错  法庭说 - 法庭得听医生的

224
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,800
It's all under control.

225
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:42,601
爸  放松  法庭说没事  好吗？

226
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
Well... okay, okay. Congratulations.

227
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:44,214
别担心

228
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,280
Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?

229
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:46,192
爸  是法庭准许我回家的

230
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant. It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.

231
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,631
我们几个月前就达成一致了

232
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:49,561
这是跟法庭的辩诉交易

233
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,240
How you gonna pay for it?

234
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,264
是律师说的  他让我们辩诉

235
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it.

236
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,792
这样我服刑八个月就能出来了

237
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,560
From your bookmaking?

238
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:55,860
都是按计划来的

239
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Who told you that? Mom told me. Outside.

240
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
I did not. No, I didn't.

241
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,821
好吧  恭喜你

242
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,120
You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about?

243
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,960
Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, Don't say anything,

244
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,520
but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking. ?

245
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,700
- 谢谢 - 你最近怎么样？

246
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,651
我打算开家餐厅  卖乳酪牛排什么的

247
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,480
Why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him? He has the wrong idea.

248
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:08,821
你哪来的钱？

249
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,474
我存够钱了  放心吧

250
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,240
Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm more concerned about you than anything else.

251
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,279
你赌球赚的钱？

252
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:14,885
- 谁跟你说的？- 妈妈在外面跟我说的

253
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Good, Dad. Good.

254
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:16,290
我可没说

255
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,760
Okay, the question, the big question, is what are you gonna do with yourself?

256
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:17,067
妈  你刚刚在外面跟我说的

257
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:20,007
就在5分钟前我们上楼的时候

258
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,680
What am I gonna do? I'm getting in shape, I'm getting trim,

259
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,804
你说别多嘴  你爸丢了工作  现在在赌球

260
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm getting really fit for Nikki. I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching

261
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,640
syllabus and get my old job back.

262
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:28,893
多洛蕾丝  干嘛要跟他说  他理解错了

263
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:32,796
没事  帕特里克  我最担心的是你

264
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,520
Nikki sold the house. She left. Didn't your mother tell you that?

265
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:33,676
我很好  爸爸  很好

266
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,872
现在最大的问题是  你有什么打算？

267
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,880
Let me tell you something. You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad?

268
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,564
我的打算？ 我要减肥

269
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,920
All right? Our marriage... we're very, very much in love,

270
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,588
能配得上尼基  还要读完尼基教学大纲的书

271
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,680
okay? Just like you two.

272
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,960
Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's not around anymore. Nikki left.

273
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:45,756
回去工作

274
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,960
What are you doing, Dad? You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior. What does that mean?

275
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:53,261
她把房子卖了  她走了

276
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this

277
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,203
你妈没告诉你吗？

278
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,462
听我说  你根本不了解我的婚姻

279
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,480
negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining,

280
00:07:57,638 --> 00:08:01,676
我们的婚姻…我们感情很好

281
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,200
that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit.

282
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:03,508
就像你们俩一样

283
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,680
That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.

284
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:10,035
帕特里克  她搬走了  不住这附近了

285
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,662
爸  你想干什么  我会精进不休

286
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,288
- 精进不休 - 什么意思？

287
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:18,134
你知道吗  我会承受所有的不愉快

288
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,972
化之为动力  拨开乌云  发现一丝幸福线

289
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:21,765
我说到做到  绝不是胡扯

290
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:24,363
这不是胡扯  我会为之努力  我会把它实现

291
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,000
What the fuck?!

292
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
Stupid fucking book!

293
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,320
I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids.

294
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,760
I mean the whole time -let me just break it down for you

295
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,600
- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war

296
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,040
and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...

297
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,520
It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.

298
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
... and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting

299
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,226
搞什么啊？！

300
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,880
blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with

301
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,280
Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful?

302
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,906
「永别了  武器」

303
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,003
这是什么该死的破书！

304
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,520
She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and they're

305
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,860
真不敢相信尼基居然让学生看这种书

306
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance --

307
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:12,399
我是说  自始至终…听我慢慢说

308
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,200
they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them

309
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:15,337
你一直盼着海明威笔下这个人能从战争中挺过来

310
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,960
dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy.

311
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:17,935
跟他爱的凯瑟琳・巴克利在一起…

312
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,840
You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending.

313
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,512
帕特  现在才凌晨4点

314
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,720
She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard

315
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,990
他办到了  他真的办到了  他挺过来了

316
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:26,178
他挨了一炮居然挺过来了

317
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,640
enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is.

318
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:28,287
带着凯瑟琳逃到瑞士

319
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Can't somebody say, Hey, let's be positive?

320
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:30,665
就在这时凯瑟琳怀孕了  这不是好事吗？

321
00:09:30,800 --> 00:10:31,160
Let's have a good ending to the story??

322
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:33,006
她怀孕了  他们逃到了山里

323
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:35,807
他们会很幸福  一起喝酒  一起跳舞

324
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,360
Pat, you owe us an apology.

325
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:37,886
他们喜欢一起跳舞  有好几场呢

326
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
Mom, for what, I can't apologize.

327
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,789
读起来很烦  但我喜欢  因为他们很幸福

328
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,920
I'm not gonna apologize for this.

329
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,760
You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of

330
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:43,452
你以为这就完了？ 没完！

331
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,720
Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.

332
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,298
他写了另一种结局

333
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too.

334
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:47,464
她死了  爸爸

335
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:50,250
我是说  这个世界已经够残忍了

336
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,920
该死的已经够残忍了

337
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,061
难道就不能来点积极的吗？

338
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,970
故事就不能有个美满结局吗？

339
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,040
Why didn't you run with me? Huh!!

340
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,024
帕特  你该向我们道歉

341
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,360
I was reading.

342
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,068
妈  凭什么  我不会道歉的

343
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,200
Please. Do us a favor, don't read for a while.

344
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,728
我不会为这件事道歉

345
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
What are you wearing a garbage bag for? I'm gonna go run now.

346
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,696
知道吗  该道歉的是欧内斯特・海明威

347
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,920
Wait, wait, wait. You have to fix this window.

348
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,720
这都是他的错

349
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
I'll fix it when I get back. Fix it now.

350
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:14,190
那就让海明威也打电话给我们道歉

351
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,640
Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.

352
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,600
I don't wanna go to therapy.

353
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,600
You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go.

354
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:25,692
你怎么不跟我一起跑步？

355
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:27,035
我要看书

356
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,048
行行好  少看点书吧

357
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:32,506
- 你套个垃圾袋干嘛？ - 我要去跑步

358
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:36,011
等等  你得先把窗户修好

359
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,595
- 我回来再修 - 现在就修

360
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,906
上车  帕特  该去看心理医生了

361
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:41,926
我不想去看心理医生

362
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:46,106
你非去不可  说好的  不然就别想住这

363
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,280
Is that song really playing?

364
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,320
We have music sometimes.

365
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,800
That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?

366
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,720
I can't.

367
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,160
What do you mean, you can't?

368
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,720
I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I-

369
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,880
Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this?

370
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,360
Is there a speaker here?

371
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,480
Is, is the speaker here?

372
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay... I'm sorry.

373
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,840
I'll fix all this, okay?

374
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:17,040
是你放的那首歌吗？

375
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,209
我们偶尔会放音乐

376
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:23,821
我受不了  能关掉吗？

377
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,840
That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. Alright!

378
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:24,811
不能

379
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's... .

380
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:26,769
什么叫不能？

381
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,080
You can call me Cliff, please.

382
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,962
遥控器不在我这里  很抱歉…

383
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,560
Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay?

384
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:30,507
廷伯斯医生叫你这么做的？

385
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
You should write that down in your, I don't know

386
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,775
扬声器在哪儿？

387
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,400
your little book you write stuff down in.

388
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,943
扬声器在哪儿？

389
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm sorry about that song. I just wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you.

390
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds,

391
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:41,846
对不起  真对不起

392
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,683
我会把这些都放好  好吗？

393
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,800
I should just tell you that right now.

394
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,680
No, You have to take medicine.

395
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,000
No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy-

396
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
No, you will have to take medication.

397
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,920
I don't want any meds, Doctor.

398
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,760
Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy.

399
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:53,081
你把事情搞得一团糟  帕特尔医生

400
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:55,134
真是一团糟  我很抱歉

401
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,443
你可以叫我克里夫

402
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm not that guy.

403
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:59,439
好吧  克里夫  你这么做是不对的

404
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,080
He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.

405
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,561
你应该把这个记在那什么上面

406
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,600
I had one incident. One incident can change a lifetime.

407
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,221
记在你的小本子上

408
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:07,018
放那首歌是我不对  我只想看是否还会刺激你

409
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,745
好极了  还是有反应

410
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,160
But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street.

411
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,050
不过我什么药也不会吃

412
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,520
She just needs to take responsibility for hers.

413
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:13,896
先跟你讲明了

414
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:14,794
你必须得吃药

415
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,480
What's hers?

416
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,155
我什么药都不会吃  一吃药我就头昏

417
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,840
What's hers? Are you joking? Let's go back to the incident.

418
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:17,876
你非吃药不可

419
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,226
我什么药都不想吃

420
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:21,830
我不爱乱发火的

421
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
I come home from work after I..

422
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,513
爱发火的是我爸

423
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:27,118
不是我

424
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,240
fight with Nancy, the high school ... principal.

425
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:29,907
他在老鹰队的比赛上打了好几次架

426
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,800
I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding.

427
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,979
被赶出了球场  上了黑名单

428
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,920
The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us.

429
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:36,638
- 我只出过一次事 - 一次就够了

430
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,560
That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd,

431
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,520
cause I should have.

432
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,440
I come home, what do I see? I walk in the door and I see underwear and

433
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:44,512
可我已经准备好了  我准备负我的责任

434
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it,

435
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,921
她也得负她的责任

436
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
and I walk up the stairs, and all...

437
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:47,818
她有什么责任？

438
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
... ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-...

439
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:51,329
她有什么责任  开什么玩笑？

440
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,440
... -VD player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song,

441
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,120
and then I look down and I see my wife's...

442
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,920
... panties on the ground and then-

443
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,594
我再给你讲讲是怎么回事

444
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,840
... I look up and I see her naked in the shower...

445
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,040
... and I think, Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower.

446
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:59,784
我上班中途回家  我一般不这样

447
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,560
What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there.

448
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,440
We never-... ... fuck in the shower anymore.

449
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,265
但那天我跟校长吵了一架

450
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,520
Maybe today we will. ?I...

451
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,945
我回到家  家里正在放我婚礼上的那首歌

452
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
... pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...

453
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:07,179
就是你今天放的那首

454
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,560
... -teacher with tenure.

455
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:09,937
我听到了也没多想

456
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,320
And you know what he says to me? You should probably go. ?

457
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:10,928
我要是想想就好了

458
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:15,042
然后呢  我进了门  看见满地的衣物

459
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,920
That's what he says to me.

460
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,178
其中还有条男裤  皮带还系在上面

461
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,800
So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking

462
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:18,913
我一上楼

463
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,880
chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.

464
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,918
就看见DVD播放器里面有张CD

465
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,350
正在放那首歌

466
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,280
All right. Can you talk about something that you did, before or after?

467
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,146
然后  我一低头就看见了地上

468
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,936
我老婆的内裤

469
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,954
抬头一看  她光着身子在洗澡

470
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,320
Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and

471
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:30,209
我就想  天哪  她在洗澡  真迷人

472
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,280
I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against

473
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,877
天赐良机  我干嘛不进去

474
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,320
me by embezzling money from the local high school, which

475
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:33,809
我们好久没在浴室做了

476
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:34,949
说不定今天可以试试

477
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:37,218
我拉开浴帘  那个该死的历史老师…

478
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,230
正忙活着呢

479
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,120
wasn't true...It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital

480
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,138
你知道他怎么说吗

481
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,400
that's because I'm, uh...

482
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:47,415
你还是回避一下吧

483
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,480
... undiagnosed bipolar.

484
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:47,856
他就是这么说的

485
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:52,600
然后我就爆发了  差点把他打死

486
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,840
Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe

487
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,088
可我凭什么因为这个受罚？

488
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,806
我跟我爸一样了吗？

489
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
stress, which rarely happens, thank God.

490
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:56,485
我可不觉得

491
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:01,180
好吧  能讲讲那前后发生了什么吗？

492
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,360
And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything

493
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,922
那件事发生一个礼拜前  我报了警

494
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,800
snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with

495
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,947
说我老婆跟那个历史老师背着我

496
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,520
this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all

497
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,173
贪污学校的钱

498
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,360
on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.

499
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,671
其实没这回事  是我幻想出来的

500
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,238
后来  我们去了医院

501
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,560
That had to be hard.

502
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:20,673
发现原来我有…

503
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening,

504
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:23,901
双向情感障碍症

505
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,360
which I do now. Sort of.

506
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,158
是的  情绪波动很大

507
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,360
Pat, you have to take your medication.

508
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,760
I can't, Mom. I can't.

509
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:32,138
压力作用下还会妄想

510
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,760
I will call them. They'll come for you.

511
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:32,599
幸好不常发作

512
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,760
Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them?

513
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,560
What's up?

514
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,320
I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good.

515
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:40,682
然后浴室事件发生了  一切就这么爆发了

516
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated.

517
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,800
I don't like the way it makes me look.

518
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:45,760
我才意识到原来我一直被这种毛病困扰着

519
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,080
You've gotta take your medication.

520
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,480
Why don't you just take your medication?

521
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,360
Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out,

522
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,392
而且还一直无人帮忙  只能独自面对

523
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:46,680
that's what I'm doin'.

524
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,760
Why is he wearing a garbage bag?

525
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,280
Why are you wearing a garbage bag?

526
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:54,018
成天紧张得指关节发白

527
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,320
To sweat.

528
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,520
Sit down. We're seven minutes in, no score. Come on, help turn the juju around.

529
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,440
I don't believe in juju, Dad.

530
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:56,402
难为你了

531
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,640
Come on, Mister Excelsior. You wanna be positive? Be positive. Sit down.

532
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,947
是的  真的很难

533
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,120
All right, all right.

534
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,719
尤其是当你不知道怎么回事的时候

535
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,520
Come on.

536
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,355
虽然我现在大概知道了

537
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,880
For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game.

538
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,840
He says you're good.... . luck, honey.

539
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:05,495
帕特  你得吃药

540
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,040
What's that in your hand?

541
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,240
It's a... see?

542
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:07,104
我没法吃  妈

543
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:09,011
那我就给他们打电话  让他们把你带走

544
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,280
Handkerchief? Yeah.

545
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:10,159
你怎么会那么做  你不会的

546
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:11,132
你怎么会去找他们

547
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:11,927
怎么了？

548
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:12,936
妈  我吃了药会不舒服

549
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:13,766
真的不舒服

550
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:17,092
我不吃药的话清醒得多  药还会让我发胖

551
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,040
That's OCD. That's crazy.

552
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,752
我不想胖成那样

553
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,720
What OCD? I want my son to watch the game with me, so sue me.

554
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:19,143
你把药吃了不就行了吗？

555
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,529
你必须得吃药

556
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,280
Just sit down, come on. I want you to watch the game with me.

557
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,213
拜托  就不能运动吗  我一直在健身

558
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,560
I'm not superstitious. That's a small thing that I do.

559
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:23,550
现在正准备去呢

560
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,716
他干嘛要套个垃圾袋在身上？

561
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,368
你干嘛要套个垃圾袋在身上？

562
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,680
If I make a lot of money, what's the difference if I do this or that?

563
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:28,384
更容易出汗

564
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:31,872
坐下来  我们0比7落后呢

565
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,440
It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on.

566
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,388
来帮我把运气转回来

567
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.

568
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:34,202
爸  我可不信什么运气

569
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:35,822
得了  精进不休先生

570
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,040
You see?! You see that?! You're meant to be here!

571
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,359
你不是想积极吗  过来坐下

572
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:38,998
来吧

573
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:41,395
就看一会儿  看完开局我就走

574
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,760
This is special. Everything happens for a reason.

575
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:43,062
他说你是福星呢  儿子

576
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,960
That's why you came home. Embrace it! Embrace it!

577
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:43,861
你手里拿着什么？

578
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,999
是个…看见没有？

579
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,280
I'm the reason? I don't think so.

580
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. I got your whole sheet.

581
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,560
Mom. Yeah. No, no...

582
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:50,309
- 手帕？ - 嗯

583
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,320
... I'm just confirming.

584
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,520
I'm just confirming. Okay.

585
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

586
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,480
Can I do. . an interview for a school project on mental illness? No.

587
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,576
强迫症  疯子

588
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,600
It's for a school project! Don't pay any attention.

589
00:15:57,576 --> 00:16:00,847
我只想让儿子陪我看球  有错吗？

590
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,520
Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it? That's him.

591
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:04,525
坐下来  我只是想让你陪我看场球

592
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,240
Is he the guy who's having the problem?

593
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,320
People are stupid. They, they, they, they don't know what they're saying.

594
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,966
我这不是迷信  不过是个小嗜好而已

595
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, that's the one.

596
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,480
Don't let them hurt your feelings.

597
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,440
Pat, don't look for Nikki! Take your camera and get out of here!

598
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:11,217
只要能赚到钱  怎么赚的又有什么关系？

599
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
Patrick, please. Pat!

600
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:13,062
小嗜好而已嘛  快坐下

601
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,720
Patty! Don't look for Nikki!

602
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,219
我在做小点心

603
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,663
你懂了吗  这是注定的！

604
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,428
这个球很特别  它是因为你才进的

605
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:26,765
这就是你回家的价值  承认吧！

606
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,169
因为我？ 我可不觉得

607
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:31,635
是的  汤米  我知道了

608
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,612
- 妈 - 对  不…

609
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:33,390
我只是在确认

610
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,659
我只是在确认  好

611
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:35,605
我来  我来

612
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,000
我论文选题是关于精神疾病  能做个采访吗？

613
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Ms. Meckers!

614
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,815
不行

615
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,640
Oh, God! Oh, God!

616
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,002
- 是为了写论文 - 别放在心上

617
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,840
Nance! This is my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday!

618
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:42,900
- 是里克・德・安杰洛吧？- 就是他

619
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:44,781
他才有病吧？

620
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,600
How are you? Hey.

621
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,188
那些人都有病  说的都是胡话

622
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,120
What are you doing here?

623
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:46,641
没错  是他

624
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,157
犯不着为他们受气

625
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,920
I just came by to say hi, to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.

626
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:52,333
- 帕特  别去找尼基！- 拿上你的相机  滚！

627
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,640
You shouldn't be here.

628
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,840
I'll work full-time, half-time.

629
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:54,761
帕特里克  回来！

630
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,440
I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want.

631
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,844
帕特  别去找尼基！

632
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,800
Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.

633
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,720
I got it. I got it. I got it.

634
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,360
Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something.

635
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,680
Does Nikki still work here?

636
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,800
You know I can't tell you that. But Doug Culpepper is still here.

637
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,200
Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage.

638
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,920
What, are you being, a troublemaker?

639
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,080
You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight?

640
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.

641
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,440
Get away from me! Get away!

642
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,120
I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay?

643
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes.

644
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.

645
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,441
梅克尔女士！

646
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,320
I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?

647
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,514
天哪！

648
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,730
南希  我运气真好！

649
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,520
You just have to give it some time.

650
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,425
你居然星期天还来上班了！

651
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,360
Yes.

652
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:28,740
你好吗？

653
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
You know, a lot went down. People will get over it.

654
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,331
你跑来干嘛？

655
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,800
It'll be all good. It'll work out.

656
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,840
Yes! It will be!

657
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,632
我只是过来打个招呼

658
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy!

659
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,440
A silver development! That's a silver lining!

660
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:33,245
顺便跟你说  我准备回来工作了

661
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,200
Good luck.

662
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,006
你不该来的

663
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,210
我干全职也行  兼职也行

664
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,982
代课也行  教历史也行  随便你

665
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Ronnie! Pat.

666
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:41,671
我帮你  不好意思  我吓到你了

667
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:43,616
我问你件事  就问一句

668
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,120
There he is! He's back!

669
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:44,499
尼基还在这上班吗？

670
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:47,715
我不能告诉你  不过道格・卡尔佩珀还在

671
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,160
Hey.

672
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:50,351
干嘛告诉我  你明知道他拆散了我们

673
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,520
Welcome home.

674
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,044
你这是找茬吗？

675
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,520
Thank you.

676
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,600
Welcome back, man.

677
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,480
Yeah, I'm out.

678
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,795
你气色不错  瘦了吗？

679
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,480
Yeah? You're out out?

680
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,160
Uh-huh.

681
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,360
Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight. I almost didn't recognize you.

682
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:56,836
没错  我是瘦了  谢谢

683
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,120
Thank you.

684
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,845
走开  离我远点！

685
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work's out of

686
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,640
control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back.

687
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,609
我只是想让你知道  我已经好了

688
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,640
I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby.

689
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:04,619
我再好不过了  看我的眼睛

690
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,219
看我的眼睛  看我的眼神多清醒

691
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,200
She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.

692
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:09,131
我再也不会抱怨了  变得很乐观了

693
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.

694
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:10,378
你只要花点时间就好

695
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:11,324
好

696
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:12,694
很多人都出过问题  但总会克服的

697
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:13,819
都会没事的  会好起来的

698
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,960
'Cause you think Veronica still hates you?

699
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,870
没错  一定会的！

700
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:16,127
乌云会慢慢散开的  南希！

701
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,623
会散开的  背后就是一道幸福线！

702
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,840
I know Veronica still hates me. That's not true.

703
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:19,422
祝你好运

704
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,240
Yes, it is. Nikki always said that

705
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,840
Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse. ?

706
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:26,907
罗尼  我是帕特

707
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,040
That's not true.

708
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Ronnie! What are you doing?

709
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,920
Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you,

710
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:31,859
是他  他回来了！

711
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,560
you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner?

712
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:33,106
你好

713
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:34,475
欢迎回来

714
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Hmm?

715
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:35,666
谢谢

716
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Did you invite him?

717
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:36,644
欢迎回来啊  老兄

718
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,360
Yes.

719
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:37,435
是啊  我出院了

720
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,680
Well, can he make it?

721
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:38,526
是吗  你出院了？

722
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,880
I don't know yet!  Can you

723
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:39,206
对

724
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,487
太棒了  你瘦了  我差点没认出来

725
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,760
make it next Sunday?

726
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,296
谢谢

727
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,634
很抱歉我没能去医院看你

728
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,800
Sure.

729
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:44,770
没办法  工作一团糟

730
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,080
I'll see you next Sunday.

731
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:48,031
她刚生了宝宝  你能回来我真的很高兴

732
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right?

733
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:51,952
我很惦记你  真想跟你好好聊聊

734
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,160
Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?

735
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,760
Yeah.

736
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:53,251
你一定要来看看我女儿

737
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,400
Get in here, please. I need you.

738
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:55,934
她可漂亮了  维罗妮卡想请你来吃晚餐

739
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Okay.

740
00:18:56,147 --> 00:19:00,069
恭喜你当爸爸了  不过晚餐还是算了吧

741
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,360
As soon as you left, the Redskins threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El.

742
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,920
Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging it, loses the challenge, loses the game.

743
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:02,634
难道你觉得维罗妮卡还是对你有成见？

744
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,040
You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do.

745
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,029
- 我知道她一直对我有成见 - 没这回事

746
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,550
就是这样的  尼基以前总说

747
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,600
And we should spend time together anyway. I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.

748
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,920
I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news.

749
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:14,310
罗尼就是个妻管严  老婆指东他绝不敢往西

750
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,200
What's that? What's the good news?

751
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,278
没这回事

752
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,080
Things are looking up.

753
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:16,005
罗尼  你在干嘛？

754
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,508
好吧  我承认有点

755
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,080
Oh, are they?

756
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:20,431
不过你要是还以为她讨厌你

757
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,200
You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it.

758
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:23,549
那就错了  要不然她干嘛请你来吃晚餐？

759
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,840
Listen, she might be with that guy.

760
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,088
你邀请他没有？

761
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,640
That, the... .

762
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,026
请了

763
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,240
Oh, no way!

764
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,287
那他能来吗？

765
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,400
She--, no, she might be with him. She's afraid of you.

766
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:29,129
还不知道！

767
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,280
She doesn't want to talk to you.

768
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:31,010
下个星期天行吗？

769
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,560
No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?

770
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,160
Put the phone down. You gotta...

771
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:32,941
行

772
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,840
Wait just a minute.

773
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:34,453
下个星期天见

774
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,520
... Put the phone down, please.

775
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,200
What are you doing?

776
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,013
你们能联系上尼基吧？

777
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,760
Listen--, stop.

778
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,393
维罗妮卡跟尼基还有来往吗？

779
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:39,114
有

780
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,200
Pat!

781
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:43,850
快进屋  我找你有事

782
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,200
You gotta understand me. You wanna go back? Well then, stop this!

783
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,440
Then don't fucking do this.

784
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:44,872
好

785
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,440
Don't talk to me like that.

786
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,560
Well then, don't behave this way.

787
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:50,061
你一走  那帮印第安人就耍了个花招

788
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,280
I got... a call asking to...

789
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,040
... check on this house. Pat

790
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:53,148
安迪・瑞德浪费了一次暂停

791
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,840
Solatano?

792
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,600
Yeah.

793
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,112
失去了反击机会  输了比赛

794
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh.

795
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,560
I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order.

796
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,010
你既然住在这  好歹尊重一下我的事情

797
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
And I heard you went to your old house and the school.

798
00:19:57,975 --> 00:19:59,343
至少陪陪我

799
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,360
It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're

800
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:00,996
我只是不想让你惹麻烦

801
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,440
gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay?

802
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:04,196
我有个天大的好消息要告诉你们

803
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,760
Five hundred feet. You hear what he just said? Youhave a restraining order.

804
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,733
什么好消息？

805
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:09,168
事情有转机了

806
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,600
Yeah, Dad, I know.

807
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:09,649
是吗？

808
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,320
Thank you, Officer.

809
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:12,824
我就知道他们为什么邀请我  我就知道

810
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,920
If you need anything... my card.

811
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
Thank you. Sorry. We understand.

812
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:14,744
听着  她可能跟那个家伙在一起了

813
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,680
Since when do cops have cards?

814
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:15,486
这…

815
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,005
不可能！

816
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:19,309
她可能会和他在一起  她怕你

817
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:20,226
不想跟你说话

818
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:21,514
不可能  爸  你是说道格・卡尔佩珀吗？

819
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,680
Tell me one thing. Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail

820
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,094
把电话放下  你会…

821
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,899
等一下

822
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,880
or to the hospital? Hmm? So take your medication and if you do fine,

823
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,636
把电话放下

824
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:25,356
你这是干什么？

825
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:26,193
听着  别打

826
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,375
- 把电话给我 - 爸  这是我自己的事情

827
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,960
we'll reduce them.

828
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,048
把电话给我  把电话给我

829
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,480
Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and

830
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:31,646
帕特！

831
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:34,087
我这是为你好  别这么做！

832
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,840
then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication.

833
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:35,131
别做这种蠢事

834
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,019
别讲这种话

835
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,760
Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it,

836
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:37,499
那你就别做这种事啊

837
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:40,006
我接到一个电话

838
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,640
that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing

839
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:41,263
要求检查一下这座房子

840
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:42,670
帕特・索拉塔诺？

841
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,720
我是

842
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,320
if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't

843
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,432
索拉塔诺夫人  索拉塔诺先生  我是基奥警官

844
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,597
负责这片辖区  据我所知  你有人身限制令

845
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,000
want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one.

846
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,496
我听说你去了过去的房子  还有学校

847
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,632
这是不允许的  你的案子分给我来管

848
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Let me say something, I gotta say something.

849
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:54,819
所以你以后会经常见到我  好自为之

850
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,440
Okay.

851
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:56,858
拿限制令当回事  好吧？

852
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
This is what I believe to be true.

853
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,560
This is what I learned in the hospital.

854
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,329
- 五百英尺以内 - 听到没有？

855
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,160
You have to do everything you can, you have to work your

856
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,391
你有人身限制令呢

857
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive,

858
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:02,235
爸  我知道

859
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:03,171
谢谢你  警官

860
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
you have a shot at a silver lining.

861
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,687
有什么需要的话  这是我的名片

862
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:06,546
谢谢你  不好意思  我们知道了

863
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:07,937
警察什么时候开始印名片了？

864
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,240
Work on a strategy, okay?

865
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,920
Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like

866
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,792
我问你  你是想回去坐牢

867
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,640
a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for... .

868
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:20,089
还是想回医院  老老实实吃药

869
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey

870
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,299
等你好了  就不用吃了

871
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,960
that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.

872
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:25,987
尼基在等我康复  等我重振旗鼓

873
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,240
Which jersey?

874
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:29,475
那时候她就会回到我身边  这比什么药都管用

875
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,040
DeSean Jackson.

876
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
DeSean Jackson is the man.

877
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,562
帕特  那只是一种可能  可你也得有心理准备

878
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,200
Well, that settles that.

879
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:35,838
她可能不会回来了

880
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,587
如果你真的爱她  就该让她走

881
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,440
等她自己决定是否回来

882
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,450
另外  如果听到那首歌

883
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,960
Pat! What are you doin'?

884
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,299
我希望你不要再崩溃了  想个对策  这很有必要

885
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,720
I gotta go, man.

886
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:46,856
我有话要说

887
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,680
Why?

888
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:47,899
行

889
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,640
I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.

890
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:50,955
这是我的信条

891
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. I wish I was wearing that jersey.

892
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,105
这是我在医院里所学到的

893
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,800
I feel like an idiot.

894
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,885
你要竭尽你所能  尽你最大的努力

895
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,480
Are you comfortable?

896
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,320
Veronica's not gonna like it.

897
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:58,228
只要你努力了  只要你始终积极向上

898
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:55,920
Get over here.

899
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,600
Plus you got a tie on.

900
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,920
Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come.

901
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,680
Really?

902
00:21:58,424 --> 00:22:00,067
你就能从乌云背后看到一丝幸福线

903
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,600
Get over here.

904
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,320
DeSean Jackson's in the house!

905
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,293
还是想想对策  好吗？

906
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,920
You mean rookie of the year?

907
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:05,760
Yeah.

908
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,360
DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?

909
00:22:07,198 --> 00:22:11,278
我朋友罗尼星期天晚上有个聚会

910
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,800
Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.

911
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,360
Isn't it awesome?

912
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,349
是那种正式晚宴

913
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,560
Not for dinner.

914
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:14,319
他老婆维罗妮卡又很讲究…

915
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,240
Look, he got us flowers.

916
00:22:15,383 --> 00:22:16,592
我妈找了套西装让我穿

917
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,600
Oh, that's sweet. That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.

918
00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:18,285
可我想穿件球衣

919
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,280
And wine.

920
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:20,170
是我哥杰克送我的老鹰队球衣

921
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,000
Hey.

922
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:20,720
Hey.

923
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:22,024
谁的球衣？

924
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,920
Check this out. We just redid the whole thing.

925
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,280
Wow!

926
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:23,887
德肖恩・杰克逊

927
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,200
Tremendous. Tremendous.

928
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:26,213
德肖恩・杰克逊是条汉子

929
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,000
Isn't it great?

930
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,640
Tremendous.

931
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:28,609
那就这么定了

932
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,880
Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again.

933
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,520
Why?

934
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,480
Because. Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.

935
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,440
Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain.

936
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,480
Isn't the market down, though?

937
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,520
It is down, but you know, she wants more, so I'm giving her more, man.

938
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,960
Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.

939
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:39,464
帕特  你怎么了？

940
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,080
I'm sorry, man.

941
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,640
Yeah.

942
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,680
A lot of people. My uncle, too.

943
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,320
Really?

944
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:42,383
我得走了

945
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,760
Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect, it's not personal,

946
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,840
but this is the time to strike.

947
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,570
为什么？

948
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:46,572
我不能留下来  我错了  不该穿成这样

949
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,480
You start snapping up commercial real estate -- cheap -- flip it

950
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,973
没事  那件球衣挺好的  我都想穿了

951
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,520
over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money.

952
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:49,731
我觉得蠢死了

953
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,280
But the pressure... it's like... .

954
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:50,449
你不自在吗？

955
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:51,293
维罗妮卡会不喜欢的

956
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:52,050
过来吧

957
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:52,630
你还系了领带呢

958
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:53,923
别担心了  你可是贵客

959
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,216
想怎么样就怎么样

960
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,400
You okay?

961
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,030
真的吗？

962
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,812
来吧

963
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,680
I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me.

964
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,630
德肖恩・杰克逊大驾光临！

965
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:01,782
你是说那个年度最佳新球员？

966
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,440
I feel like I'm getting crushed and-

967
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:02,392
就是他

968
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,917
德肖恩・杰克逊  德肖恩・杰克逊

969
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,120
Crushed by what?

970
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:07,464
天  你居然穿件球衣来宴会

971
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,520
Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work,

972
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,240
很酷吧

973
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,440
and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, you know, and,

974
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,490
不太合时宜

975
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,267
他还带了花来呢

976
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:15,559
真漂亮  帕特  你真有心

977
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,720
and, and I'm like... suffocating.

978
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,600
Holy shit.

979
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:17,041
好啊

980
00:23:17,225 --> 00:23:19,403
来看看吧  我们刚刚重新装修过

981
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,440
You can't be happy all the time.

982
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,080
Who told you you can't be happy?

983
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,545
太棒了  太棒了

984
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,320
It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice.

985
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:23,405
不错吧？

986
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,069
太棒了

987
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,600
That's not true at all. You just can't.

988
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,362
我还想再装修一次

989
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:25,991
为什么？

990
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:28,032
- 因为… - 那可得花不少钱呢

991
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,160
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

992
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:30,079
我们付得起  没得说的

993
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,680
I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over.

994
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,153
经济不是不景气吗？

995
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,760
You okay with that? Who?

996
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:34,467
是不景气  可她想要什么我就得满足她

997
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,600
Veronica's sister.

998
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,396
我爸失去了养老金了

999
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,400
Tiffany. Tiffany and... Tommy?

1000
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:36,564
我很遗憾

1001
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,360
Yeah. Just Tiffany.

1002
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,218
很多人都这样  我叔父也是

1003
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,280
What happened to Tommy?

1004
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:38,954
是吗？

1005
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,160
He died.

1006
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:41,419
是  不过你知道吗  我不是在说你爸

1007
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,640
Tommy died? Cops die.

1008
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,024
现在正是罢工的好时机

1009
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,640
How'd he die?

1010
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,745
你可以开始抢购商品房

1011
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,160
Please, don't bring it up.

1012
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,363
趁现在便宜  到处都在抛售

1013
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,000
No, how did he die?

1014
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,040
How did who die?

1015
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:48,904
然后你再转手抛出去  就能赚到差价

1016
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,120
Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.

1017
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:52,384
但这个压力…实在是…

1018
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:55,648
你还好吧？

1019
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,240
You look nice.

1020
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,205
我不太好  别跟人说

1021
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,560
Thank you.

1022
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,960
I'm not flirting with you.

1023
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:04,026
我感觉自己快被压碎了

1024
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,760
Oh, I didn't think you were.

1025
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,920
I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my

1026
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,960
wife, I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty.

1027
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:04,752
什么事？

1028
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:09,348
家庭、孩子、工作、混账同事  所有这些

1029
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,360
I never used to do that. I do that now.

1030
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,400
Cause we're gonna be better than ever... Nikki. Just practicing.

1031
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,413
我觉得自己像是这样…

1032
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,640
How'd Tommy die?

1033
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:16,821
都快要窒息了

1034
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,560
What about your job?

1035
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:17,773
天哪

1036
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:20,719
人没办法一直保持那么快乐

1037
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,440
I just got fired, actually.

1038
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:22,788
谁说不能？

1039
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,320
Oh, really? How?

1040
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:24,751
是这样的  你只能尽力而为  别无选择

1041
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,520
I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?

1042
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,400
Does it really matter?

1043
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:27,146
- 不是这样的 - 真的不行

1044
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,142
罗尼  罗尼！

1045
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,200
Baby, how's it going?

1046
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:30,334
维罗妮卡的妹妹也要过来  别介意

1047
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,280
Great, great.

1048
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,526
- 你不介意吧？ - 谁啊？

1049
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,425
维罗妮卡的妹妹

1050
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,323
- 蒂芙尼 - 蒂芙尼和…汤米？

1051
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,339
只有蒂芙尼过来

1052
00:24:38,457 --> 00:24:39,378
汤米怎么了？

1053
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,760
We're gonna go on a tour now.

1054
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:41,282
他死了

1055
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,240
Let's go see the house.

1056
00:24:41,348 --> 00:24:42,837
- 汤米死了？ - 警察总是活不长

1057
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,480
Come on, let's go for the tour.

1058
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,635
他怎么死的？

1059
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,800
I've, I've been planning this forever. I love our house.

1060
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,700
拜托  别提这事儿

1061
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:45,539
他怎么死的？

1062
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,400
I love our house. I'm really excited about it.

1063
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,423
谁怎么死的？

1064
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,480
Come on.

1065
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:53,760
蒂芙尼  这是帕特  帕特  这是我妻妹

1066
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,720
Guess what it is.

1067
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
Oh, it's a television. It's a computer screen. Nope.

1068
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,960
Just keep going, keep going, keep going.

1069
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,320
It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven. It's a light. It's a...

1070
00:24:58,423 --> 00:24:59,107
你看上去很漂亮

1071
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,200
Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.

1072
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:00,636
谢谢

1073
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,800
... it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead

1074
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:01,957
我这不是在调戏你

1075
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,080
bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde. Where would the body go, though?

1076
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:03,813
我也没那么觉得

1077
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,680
It's a joke!

1078
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:06,021
我看得出来你用心打扮了  我想跟我妻子和好

1079
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,640
It's a... fireplace.

1080
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,203
正在为之努力  我要学会夸赞她的美貌

1081
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,360
In the middle of the wall?

1082
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,743
我以前从不这么做  现在要学着做了

1083
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,280
We have a port in every room. Gimme an iPod.

1084
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:15,855
这样我们就能和好  为了尼基练习一下而已

1085
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,640
Who, who doesn't have an iPod?

1086
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:17,119
汤米怎么死的？

1087
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,320
Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone.

1088
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,240
They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki.

1089
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,551
工作还顺利吗？

1090
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,800
Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that.

1091
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:23,269
我刚被炒了

1092
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,040
I would call Nikki.

1093
00:25:23,403 --> 00:25:24,216
天哪  真的吗  怎么炒的？

1094
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,640
I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one.

1095
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:27,554
不好意思  我是说  怎么回事？

1096
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,560
Gimme your iPod.

1097
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,501
这还重要吗？

1098
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,520
Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you.

1099
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,480
Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in,

1100
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:33,455
亲爱的  你们好吗？

1101
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,600
I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.

1102
00:25:33,774 --> 00:25:34,573
很好  很好

1103
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,600
I can play music for the baby in any room.

1104
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
Can you play Ride the Lightning?by Metallica?

1105
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,960
Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany.

1106
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,880
Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.

1107
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:45,498
带他们到处转转吧

1108
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:46,025
咱们去参观房子吧

1109
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,040
Here's a fun fact. You know where the term OK?comes from?

1110
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:47,419
走吧  带你们转转

1111
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:49,703
我筹划好久了  我爱我们的房子

1112
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,360
No. No, I don't.

1113
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:52,421
我爱我们的房子  我实在太兴奋了

1114
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,800
Where?

1115
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:53,755
走吧

1116
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,480
Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of

1117
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,200
America, is from Kinderhook, New York...

1118
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:55,903
猜猜这是干什么用的

1119
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,680
Oh.

1120
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:58,394
- 电视机 - 电脑屏 - 都不对

1121
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,320
... and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook.

1122
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,330
继续猜  继续猜

1123
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,080
And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say,

1124
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,786
- 是个砖灶 - 是个壁灯

1125
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,200
That guy's OK. ? Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.

1126
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:03,693
再想想

1127
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:05,345
是停尸房抽屉  从里面把尸体拖出来

1128
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:08,790
注射福尔马林  然后要把尸体放在哪？

1129
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,680
Really?

1130
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,760
Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

1131
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,470
我说着玩的！

1132
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,480
That's interesting.

1133
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:13,530
这是个壁炉

1134
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,200
You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years and she's

1135
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,640
real good at it. She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.

1136
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,356
在墙中间？

1137
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.

1138
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,392
我们每个房间都有接口  给我个iPod

1139
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,560
Why do you have to talk about me like that?

1140
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,177
谁会没有iPod啊？

1141
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
I'm just bragging about you. Can't I brag about my little sister?

1142
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,280
Don't talk about me in the third person.

1143
00:26:22,338 --> 00:26:24,667
我就没有  我连手机也没有

1144
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Please, gimme a break.

1145
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,667
他们不准我打电话  怕我打给尼基

1146
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,560
I'm right here.

1147
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:28,404
别想这个了

1148
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,560
Just be nice. Just be nice.

1149
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,480
Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.

1150
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,608
我是会打给尼基的

1151
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,280
Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

1152
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:31,333
我送个iPod给你吧

1153
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,320
I know. I know, I know.

1154
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:32,295
我有个旧的

1155
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,268
把你的iPod给我

1156
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,520
What meds are you on?

1157
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,295
给我  谢谢

1158
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,338
既然那么多房间都有iPod接口

1159
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,880
Me? None. I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify,

1160
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:39,550
你干嘛偏偏带我们来洗手间看这个

1161
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,670
不管在哪个房间  我都能给宝宝放音乐

1162
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,400
but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy

1163
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,724
能放金属乐队的《乘着闪电》吗？

1164
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,520
and they also make me bloated.

1165
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,160
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp,

1166
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,315
蒂芙尼  帕特以前在高中当历史老师

1167
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,200
so I stopped. You ever take Klonopin?

1168
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,359
随便挑任总统问他  他能给你如数家珍

1169
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,120
Klonopin?  Yeah.

1170
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:54,655
给你们讲个好玩的

1171
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,000
Right? Jesus.

1172
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,402
你们知道“OK”这个词怎么来的吗？

1173
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,760
It's like, What? What day is it?? How about Trazodone?

1174
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:57,037
不知道

1175
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,120
Trazodone!

1176
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:58,527
怎么来的？

1177
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,680
Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done.

1178
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,440
马丁・范步伦  美国第八任总统

1179
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,720
It takes the light right out of your eyes.

1180
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:03,135
纽约州肯德胡克人

1181
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,720
God, I bet it does.

1182
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:07,415
他组建了一个男性俱乐部  叫老肯德胡克

1183
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:10,323
要是一个人够酷  又进了那个俱乐部

1184
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,480
I'm tired. I wanna go.

1185
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:13,549
别人就会说“那家伙OK”  因为他是老肯德胡克的

1186
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,360
No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we haven't even finished the salad

1187
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:14,156
真的吗？

1188
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,360
yet, or the duck. I made the Fire and Ice cake.

1189
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:15,287
真的  有意思吧

1190
00:27:15,371 --> 00:27:16,131
有意思

1191
00:27:16,155 --> 00:27:18,796
蒂芙尼练过几年舞蹈

1192
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,960
I said I'm tired. Are you gonna walk me home or what?

1193
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:22,341
跳得可棒了  她要参加富兰克林酒店的比赛

1194
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:24,818
是吗  我老婆也喜欢跳舞  尼基喜欢跳舞

1195
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,640
You mean me?

1196
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,452
你干嘛用那种口气说我的事情？

1197
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,760
Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?

1198
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:28,495
我在夸你呢  我就不能夸自己的妹妹吗？

1199
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,360
You have poor social skills. You have a problem.

1200
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,316
别在外人面前讲我的事情

1201
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,280
I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than

1202
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:32,333
拜托  给我个面子吧

1203
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:33,745
我已经给你面子了

1204
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,560
appropriate things. You scare people.

1205
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:35,809
态度好点儿

1206
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,160
I tell the truth. But you're mean.

1207
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:37,830
好精彩

1208
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,800
What? I'm not telling the truth?

1209
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:39,724
不好意思  我也不想这么不讲理

1210
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?

1211
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:41,854
没事儿  我知道

1212
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,120
You can drive them both home. Now.

1213
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,117
你用的是什么药？

1214
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:49,722
我什么也没用  以前用斯瑞康和阿立派唑

1215
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,040
Stop talking about me in third person. You can take Tiffany home first.

1216
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,600
You love it when I have problems.

1217
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,344
不过现在不吃了  吃了头晕

1218
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,680
You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.

1219
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,480
No... I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice,

1220
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,550
还会发胖

1221
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:57,054
我以前用阿普唑仑和文法拉辛

1222
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,960
I just wanted to have a nice dinner. Oh, God.

1223
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:58,345
不过头脑确实糊涂

1224
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,520
What is your problem?!

1225
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:00,499
- 我就没再用了 - 用过氯硝西泮吗？

1226
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,440
Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go.

1227
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:01,425
氯硝西泮？ 用过

1228
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,280
Come on, are you ready?

1229
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:02,369
- 对吧？ - 天哪

1230
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,200
You really, you really wanna go right now?

1231
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:05,174
感觉就好像  今天礼拜几来着

1232
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,880
Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.

1233
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,979
- 曲唑酮呢？- 曲唑酮！

1234
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!

1235
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.

1236
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,374
那玩意真能把人放倒  吃了就像死人一样

1237
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:11,443
两眼无光

1238
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:13,478
天  肯定是的

1239
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:20,572
我累了  我要走了

1240
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:24,630
不行  我们连沙拉都还没吃完

1241
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,744
鸭肉也没吃  我还做了冰淇淋呢

1242
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,920
Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't

1243
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,528
我说我累了  你送不送我回家？

1244
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,680
really remember how this works.

1245
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,360
How what works?

1246
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:35,331
你问我？

1247
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,000
I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat.

1248
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,552
就是你  送我回家吗？

1249
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,600
You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are.

1250
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,321
你完全不通人情  情商很有问题

1251
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,120
I live in the addition around back, which is completely

1252
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,357
我情商有问题？ 你说的明明比我还不得体

1253
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,640
separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking

1254
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:46,481
根本不顾别人感受

1255
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,800
in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner

1256
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:47,348
我那叫坦诚  你这叫不讲理

1257
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:49,049
什么  我怎么不讲理了？

1258
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,720
because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?

1259
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,459
要不我把你俩各自送回家？

1260
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:56,707
你可以把他俩一起送回家  现在就送

1261
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,040
How old are you?

1262
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:59,654
- 少在外人面前说我 - 先送蒂芙尼

1263
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,840
Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.

1264
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:01,360
你可喜欢看我出糗了

1265
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,589
你可喜欢了  让你有种优越感  对吧

1266
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,720
Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really

1267
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:07,501
没有  没有  我只是想…

1268
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,080
pretty, but I'm married, okay?

1269
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,040
- 只是想好好吃顿饭 - 天哪

1270
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:10,684
你到底哪里不满意？

1271
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,400
You're married? So am I.

1272
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,685
我没什么不满意  我只是累了  想回家

1273
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:13,562
你走吗？

1274
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,552
你真的现在就要走吗？

1275
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:17,320
没错  我真的要走了  感谢你们的盛情款待

1276
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,520
No, that's confusing. He's dead.

1277
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:18,448
拜托  轻点儿  宝宝睡了！

1278
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,637
不好意思  我不是有意要吵醒宝宝的  再见

1279
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,480
Wait, what?

1280
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,160
What's happening?

1281
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,840
Oh, my God. Hey.

1282
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,390
我结婚以后就没有约会过了

1283
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,730
所以不记得这事儿有什么规矩了

1284
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,956
什么事？

1285
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:48,716
我瞧见你色迷迷的眼神了  帕特

1286
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,510
你我都有感觉  别不承认  我们不是那些伪君子

1287
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:56,747
我住在后院的小楼里

1288
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,960
Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?

1289
00:29:56,747 --> 00:30:00,843
跟我父母分开住  所以我们绝对不会被他们撞见

1290
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know, Mom.

1291
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:04,089
我很讨厌你穿件球衣去晚宴

1292
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,120
What happened over there?

1293
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:08,256
我讨厌橄榄球  不过只要你别开灯  你可以上我

1294
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,440
When am I gonna get a phone?

1295
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,720
You'll get a phone in due time.

1296
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,520
What happened?

1297
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,320
Pat!

1298
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:10,652
你多大？

1299
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:16,699
大到结过婚  还混出了疯人院

1300
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:22,008
虽然今晚跟你相处很愉快  而且你很漂亮

1301
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:24,239
可我结婚了  懂吗？

1302
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:30,842
你结婚了？ 我也是

1303
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,840
Mom!

1304
00:30:31,401 --> 00:30:34,080
不  你搞错了  他死了

1305
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,720
I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up.

1306
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,760
What is it?

1307
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Where's my wedding video?

1308
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,880
It's after three o'clock! What are you doing?

1309
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,920
I looked in here, but this is all your sewing shit up here, for your

1310
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,480
sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?

1311
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,760
What about in your father's study?

1312
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:41,338
慢着  怎么了？

1313
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,600
Don't go in my study.

1314
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:43,107
你怎么了？

1315
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,960
Dad, not now!

1316
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:50,060
天哪

1317
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here.

1318
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,160
Patty, what are you doing?

1319
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,960
He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!

1320
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,840
Is it here? I mean... . ?

1321
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,240
Patty!

1322
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,240
It's probably in the attic.

1323
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,160
Are you going in my study?

1324
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,680
It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.

1325
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,640
Please stop yelling!

1326
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated

1327
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,120
because I should have my fucking wedding video!

1328
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,760
Pat! Pat!

1329
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
I looked over there! I already looked all over there!

1330
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,880
Calm down, Pat.

1331
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,320
I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears,

1332
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,484
你没事吧  罗尼打电话来了

1333
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:17,632
你衣服上的是化妆品吗？

1334
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,080
I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up!

1335
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:18,373
我不知道

1336
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,400
I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it!

1337
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:20,016
到底出什么事了？

1338
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,800
Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I...... don't care!

1339
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:21,152
什么时候才能给我个手机？

1340
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,277
到时候会给你的

1341
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Pat! Stop it!

1342
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:23,165
怎么回事？

1343
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,640
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1344
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:24,016
帕特！

1345
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,480
What's going on?

1346
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:27,760
What?

1347
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,680
I want it! It-...

1348
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,360
Hey!

1349
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,040
It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!

1350
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,960
Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1351
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,080
I can't watch my wedding video, but I CAN hear the fucking song

1352
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:48,464
妈！

1353
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:51,453
我找不到我的婚礼录像了  醒醒

1354
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:52,534
怎么了？

1355
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,581
我的婚礼录像呢？

1356
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,080
Mom?

1357
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:54,754
才3点  你搞什么鬼？

1358
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,480
What the fuck you doing?! You...... hit your mother?!

1359
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:56,869
我在这里找了  可全是针线什么的

1360
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,640
No, no, no, no, no!

1361
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:58,480
你放在这了吗？

1362
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,560
Stop it!

1363
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:00,883
在不在你爸的书房？

1364
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,640
Get off me, Dad!

1365
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:02,797
别进我书房

1366
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,120
Stop hitting him!

1367
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,680
Stop hitting him!

1368
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,229
爸  别闹！

1369
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,155
你会放在这吗？ 放这没道理啊

1370
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,508
帕特  你要干嘛？

1371
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!

1372
00:32:07,066 --> 00:32:09,546
这全是老鹰队的比赛录像  就是没婚礼录像！

1373
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:10,334
在这吗？

1374
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,240
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1375
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:10,907
帕特！

1376
00:32:10,977 --> 00:32:12,058
可能在阁楼

1377
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,814
你进我的书房了吗？

1378
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,779
感觉就像你故意把婚礼录像藏起来一样

1379
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,320
Police! Open up.

1380
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,604
别嚷了！

1381
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
Mister Solatano, I got a lot of calls.

1382
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:22,684
妈  我没嚷  我只是有点烦躁

1383
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,160
People in the neighborhood are scared. I gotta come in.

1384
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,224
因为我找不到该死的婚礼录像了!

1385
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,600
How are we doing in here, huh?

1386
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:26,922
帕特！

1387
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,480
There are a lot of reports from your neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls.

1388
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,273
- 我去那边找！ - 那边我找过了！

1389
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,120
Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her.

1390
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:33,320
静一静  帕特

1391
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,920
Hey, sit down.

1392
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,904
我才不要静一静  我不管有谁听到了

1393
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,640
Sit down.

1394
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,480
You gotta stop with these crazy theories.

1395
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:38,719
我才不要静一静  吵醒就吵醒了！

1396
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,600
He's a cop. What are you doing?

1397
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:41,151
我不觉得丢人！

1398
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,480
It's a medication problem, but he's fine now.

1399
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,840
Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore?

1400
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,641
整条街都醒过来吧  我才不管呢！

1401
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,080
We know all about the explosion at the psychiatrist's office.

1402
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,707
帕特  别嚷了！

1403
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,600
What?

1404
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:45,570
别嚷了！别嚷了！

1405
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,960
What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true.

1406
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:46,486
怎么回事？

1407
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,120
He's not allowed to talk about that.

1408
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:47,984
怎么了？

1409
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,320
Jesus Christ, who's that?

1410
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:49,059
我一定要找到！

1411
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,080
Keep an eye on him.

1412
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:53,301
那是我的婚礼  那是我的婚礼录像！

1413
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,320
Is this a bipolar episode?

1414
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:55,279
帕特  别嚷了！

1415
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,360
Get outta here, you little fuckin'

1416
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:59,590
我看不到婚礼录像  却听得到那首歌

1417
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,480
idiot! Get outta here!

1418
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,000
Someone, help me! Help me!

1419
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You can't tell Nikki about this,

1420
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,560
Officer.

1421
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,520
Look, I gotta make out a report.

1422
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,120
No, no! No!

1423
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,640
Hey! Sit down.

1424
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,440
No, no, no, listen, sir.

1425
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,880
He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me! Help me!

1426
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,840
Sit down!

1427
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,240
I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just

1428
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,880
let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing.

1429
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,760
There's a court order against you -- five hundred feet. Listen to me!

1430
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,680
... and I'll take that fucking camera and I'm gonna break it over

1431
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,200
your fuckin' head, then I'm gonna come back and interview you about

1432
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:16,262
妈？

1433
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,720
what it's like to get that fuckin' camera broken over your head!

1434
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,738
你搞什么  居然敢打你妈？

1435
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:18,949
不是的！

1436
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,000
Youwa--, what are you laughing about?

1437
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:20,955
别打了！

1438
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1439
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:23,113
爸  放开我！

1440
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,560
I'm sorry.

1441
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:24,668
别打他！

1442
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,040
Okay.

1443
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,560
Go back to sleep. The party's over. Show's over.

1444
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:27,358
别打他！

1445
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,000
... this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't... please,

1446
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,480
you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.

1447
00:33:30,346 --> 00:33:32,786
我没打他  是他在打我！

1448
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,120
You need to pipe down.

1449
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:38,368
对不起！

1450
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,880
Everything all right?

1451
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,000
Who was at the door?

1452
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,920
Who was that, Dad?

1453
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,160
It was that kid with the camera.

1454
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,240
Good luck. I gotta write this up.

1455
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,440
Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this!

1456
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,712
我是警察  开门

1457
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,000
It's okay, everything is okay. We're fine, thank you,

1458
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,680
we appreciate it. Thank you.

1459
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:45,826
索拉塔诺先生  我接到不少报警

1460
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:48,012
附近的人都吓坏了  我得进去

1461
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,188
这是怎么回事？

1462
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:54,207
我们接到了不少报案

1463
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,990
尼基被人误导了  你得跟她谈谈

1464
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:57,794
坐下

1465
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:58,558
坐下

1466
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,499
你别再胡说八道了

1467
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:01,666
他是警察  你想干嘛？

1468
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:04,632
是药物作用  不过现在没事了

1469
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:06,066
是吗  还想把他送回巴尔的摩吗？

1470
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:08,409
我们都知道他在心理医生那里发病了

1471
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:08,942
什么？

1472
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:11,390
没有  克里夫乱说的  没那回事

1473
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:12,608
他没权利谈这种事

1474
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,916
天哪  是谁？

1475
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:15,744
看好他

1476
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:18,051
这是双向情感障碍症的症状吗？

1477
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:20,146
滚出去  你个白痴！

1478
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:21,350
滚出去！

1479
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:21,870
救命！

1480
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:22,916
长官  你不能把这个告诉尼基

1481
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:24,514
我总得写报告吧

1482
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,471
不行  长官

1483
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,715

1484
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,095
那家伙在追杀我  救命！

1485
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:31,111
坐下！

1486
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,562
对不起  我可以给你写封信

1487
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:34,273
或者给我几分钟  听我解释  我真的好多了

1488
00:34:34,298 --> 00:34:36,214
法庭对你有禁令  五百英尺  听我说！

1489
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,285
我就把那台该死的摄像机砸在你头上

1490
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,000
Hey!

1491
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,875
然后再来采访你

1492
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
What the hell?

1493
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,512
被那台该死的摄像机爆头是什么滋味！

1494
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,760
What happened to your face?

1495
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:45,868
笑什么笑？

1496
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,600
Weight lifting accident.

1497
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:47,039
对不起  对不起

1498
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,680
That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house?

1499
00:34:47,064 --> 00:34:47,481
对不起就完了

1500
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:48,021
好吧

1501
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,480
Did our little conversation get you upset last night?

1502
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:52,694
回去睡觉  好戏演完了

1503
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,240
Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.

1504
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,248
这并不能反映我的精神状况  拜托了

1505
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,200
This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.

1506
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,831
你不能告诉她  不能告诉尼基

1507
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,160
I like to run by myself, okay?

1508
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:58,494
冷静一下

1509
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,120
Me too.

1510
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,304
没事吧？

1511
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,920
Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?

1512
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:00,449
门外是谁？

1513
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,800
What?

1514
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:01,396
爸  是谁？

1515
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
Okay? I'm running here! Me too!

1516
00:35:01,421 --> 00:35:02,699
拿摄像机的小孩

1517
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,120
Well then, why don't you run somewhere else?

1518
00:35:02,724 --> 00:35:04,859
祝你好运  我得去写报告了

1519
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?

1520
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:07,190
拜托  别记这件事  我不想让她看见！

1521
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,520
I like this road. This is my neighborhood.

1522
00:35:07,268 --> 00:35:07,761
没事  一切都很好  谢谢

1523
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,360
Oh, come on, please!

1524
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:11,147
我们能理解  谢谢你

1525
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,320
Calm down, crazy.

1526
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,200
Hey!

1527
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,440
What the fuck?!

1528
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm married!

1529
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,160
So am I!

1530
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,080
What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!

1531
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,480
Where is your wife?

1532
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,320
You're crazy!

1533
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,640
I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.

1534
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,720
I'm not the big slut!

1535
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1536
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,520
I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a

1537
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,920
part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other

1538
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,800
parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?!

1539
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,680
Can you forgive? Are you any good at that?

1540
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:10,313
搞什么鬼？

1541
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,360
You seemed to have trouble last night.

1542
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,410
你脸上怎么了？

1543
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,280
Let me just set the record straight about last night.

1544
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:14,409
被杠铃砸的

1545
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,920
Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it,

1546
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:18,351
少扯了  你怎么跑到我家旁边来了？

1547
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,080
and I hate my illness and I want to control it.

1548
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:21,381
我们昨晚那场小争执惹你不爽了？

1549
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,000
My father, on the other hand, had no trouble

1550
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:23,417
这是我的线路  懂吗  别跟着我

1551
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,800
slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return

1552
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,518
我家就住附近  是你跑到我家旁边来的

1553
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,160
cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old.

1554
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:27,184
我喜欢一个人跑

1555
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,720
You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean... .

1556
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:28,272
我也是

1557
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,920
He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.

1558
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:30,318
我喜欢一个人跑！你就不能停下吗？

1559
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,880
Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.

1560
00:36:30,461 --> 00:36:30,994
什么？

1561
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:32,838
- 我在这条路上跑呢！ - 我也是！

1562
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,109
你就不能换条路跑吗？

1563
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,149
可跑的路多了去了  你安的什么心？

1564
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,400
Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier.

1565
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,106
我就喜欢这条路  我家就住这

1566
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,080
You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent

1567
00:36:38,245 --> 00:36:39,046
拜托  行行好！

1568
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:40,927
静一静  你个疯子

1569
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,160
back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to

1570
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,760
a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.

1571
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,680
Yeah, but that's easier said than done.

1572
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,840
You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.

1573
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,200
Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki,

1574
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,240
okay?

1575
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,440
No.

1576
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,360
Why?

1577
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,520
Because you have a restraining

1578
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,160
order.

1579
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,680
What good are you, man?

1580
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,560
Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your

1581
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:07,532
搞什么鬼？！

1582
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:08,735
我结婚了！

1583
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,360
wedding video last night?

1584
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:09,944
我也结了！

1585
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,400
Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife

1586
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,290
胡扯什么呢  你丈夫已经死了！

1587
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,160
in eight and a half months?

1588
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:13,445
那你老婆又在哪儿呢？

1589
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,000
Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive

1590
00:37:13,826 --> 00:37:14,346
你个疯子！

1591
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,360
girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your

1592
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:17,735
我又不是刚被巴尔的摩放出来

1593
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:18,895
我又不是什么荡妇！

1594
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,960
chances of getting Nikki back to you?

1595
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,000
Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it

1596
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,280
with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.

1597
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:25,213
对不起  对不起

1598
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,160
Why is she a slut?

1599
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:28,004
我以前确实是  可现在不是了

1600
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,160
After the dinner at Ronnie's,

1601
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:30,904
我有淫荡的一面

1602
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,120
she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out. "

1603
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:33,703
可我喜欢  和我身上其它方面一样真实

1604
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,630
你敢这么说自己吗  色鬼？！

1605
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,840
Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring.

1606
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,620
你问心无愧吗  你哪来的本钱好色？

1607
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,080
So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

1608
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,480
Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex,

1609
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,560
it will be easier for you to become friends with her.

1610
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:46,377
你昨晚好像惹麻烦了

1611
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,760
She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself

1612
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:47,615
我来把昨晚的事给你讲清楚

1613
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,356
我一时失手打了我妈  我很后悔

1614
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:52,673
我恨我的疾病  我也想控制住它

1615
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,560
along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?

1616
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:54,617
另外  昨晚我爸把我一顿暴打

1617
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:57,527
一点错也没有  我也没还手

1618
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,840
Can you?

1619
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,989
我怕我会失手杀了他  他已经65岁了

1620
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,160
Is that... . ? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?

1621
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:01,615
你以为我会打不过他吗？

1622
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:02,960
Yes.

1623
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:04,054
他是在担心你母亲  你也打他了

1624
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,640
With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?

1625
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,158
是的  昨晚就是一团糟

1626
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,720
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your

1627
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:08,059
我想他也尽力了

1628
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,880
words to you. This "crazy sad shit, " as you call it, made you a

1629
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:12,064
帕特  你得有个对策  我早就告诉你了

1630
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,283
你必须认清这些负面情绪

1631
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,440
happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of

1632
00:38:15,283 --> 00:38:16,932
不然就会被送回巴尔的摩

1633
00:38:16,932 --> 00:38:19,810
一旦你感觉到这些  就赶紧找个僻静地方

1634
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,160
going outdoors, working out, and reading books.

1635
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:22,574
想尽办法冷静下来

1636
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,160
No, not the books. You said Nikki's friends with

1637
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,900
说得倒容易

1638
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,280
Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if you become friends with Tiffany,

1639
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:27,814
你必须得做到  别无选择  精进不休

1640
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,800
Nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large-hearted

1641
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:33,430
是啊  我给尼基写了封信  你交给她好吗？

1642
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,520
person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. So if

1643
00:38:34,317 --> 00:38:34,817
不行

1644
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:35,734
为什么？

1645
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,400
you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.

1646
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,834
因为你有人身限制令

1647
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:40,157
你何必呢？

1648
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,204
你昨晚为什么那么急迫地…

1649
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,058
要看婚礼录像？

1650
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,154
不知道  大概是因为我明明结婚了

1651
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,965
却八个半月见不着老婆？

1652
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:50,905
会不会是因为尼基不在  蒂芙尼又很迷人

1653
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:54,410
万一你跟蒂芙尼有了什么瓜葛

1654
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:56,127
尼基就不可能回到你身边了？

1655
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,290
分析的不坏  琼斯博士

1656
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,179
但我是不会放弃尼基

1657
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,640
Hey!

1658
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:00,935
因为蒂芙尼就是个荡妇

1659
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,200
How do you know when I run?

1660
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,596
为什么说她是个荡妇？

1661
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,000
I wanted to clarify something.

1662
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:04,783
在罗尼家吃完晚餐后

1663
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:07,834
她说  我们可以到后院的小屋去

1664
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,960
I just want us to be friends.

1665
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:10,838
只要关上灯你就可以上我

1666
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,240
Did you hear what I said?

1667
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,200
Why are you giving me such a hard time?

1668
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,718
这可是她的原话  她还戴着婚戒呢

1669
00:39:15,448 --> 00:39:17,249
所以说  她就是个对亡夫三心二意的荡妇

1670
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,760
No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

1671
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:21,646
也许她只是想交个朋友  她以为只要跟你上床

1672
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,040
I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.

1673
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:23,947
你就会愿意跟她交朋友

1674
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,880
You wanna have dinner at this diner?

1675
00:39:24,252 --> 00:39:27,433
她还说她已经不再是个荡妇了

1676
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:30,416
但她喜欢自己淫荡的那一面

1677
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,320
Pick me up at seven thirty.

1678
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,386
因为那和她身上其方他面一样真实

1679
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,853
还问我敢不敢这么说自己

1680
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:34,553
你敢吗？

1681
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:39,183
你…你是真的要我回答吗？

1682
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:39,926
是的

1683
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:44,357
我疯狂的那一面？你有病吗？

1684
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:46,762
帕特  一丝幸福线那套理论是你发明的

1685
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:49,026
我只是把那些话返还给你

1686
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:52,330
正是你所说的“疯狂”的那一面

1687
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:56,047
让你更加乐观镇定  有一个积极的人生观

1688
00:39:56,284 --> 00:39:58,857
走出家门  出去工作  读点书

1689
00:39:59,423 --> 00:40:01,677
不  我可不想再看书了

1690
00:40:01,677 --> 00:40:04,958
尼基跟罗尼  维罗妮卡和蒂芙尼是朋友

1691
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,535
如果你跟蒂芙尼成了朋友

1692
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:09,962
尼基就会觉得你是个宽厚善良的好人

1693
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,760
Happy Halloween.

1694
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:14,886
愿意伸出援手  解救迷途之人

1695
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,120
Hi.

1696
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,871
所以说  帮助蒂芙尼对你有好处

1697
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,000
Here you go.

1698
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:32,880
Thank you.

1699
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,920
I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.

1700
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:37,880
Great!

1701
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,240
Tea Be right back.

1702
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:44,013
你怎么知道我来了？

1703
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:45,585
我想跟你解释一下

1704
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,804
我只是想跟你交个朋友

1705
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:50,960
You look nice.

1706
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:51,394
听见没有？

1707
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,080
Thanks.

1708
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:55,196
你为什么要跟我过不去？

1709
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,240
Raisin Bran. Milk.

1710
00:40:57,825 --> 00:40:59,225
我没跟你过不去

1711
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,280
Thank you.

1712
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,851
你这样犯浑的时候  我真不知道该怎么办

1713
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,343
在这家餐厅吃个晚餐怎么样？

1714
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,364
七点半来接我

1715
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,360
You want to share this?

1716
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,680
Why did you order Raisin Bran?

1717
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,800
Why did you order tea?

1718
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,080
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

1719
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any

1720
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,120
mistaking this for a date.

1721
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,680
It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.

1722
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,960
It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?

1723
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,960
It's good. How's your restraining order?

1724
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,600
I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing, ?

1725
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,560
but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well.

1726
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,400
Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.

1727
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,040
And the so-called incident with the weights.

1728
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:52,053
万圣节快乐

1729
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,360
Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just

1730
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:52,634
你好

1731
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,480
explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could

1732
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,040
just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of

1733
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,800
control and that I'm actually doing really well.

1734
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,080
I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.

1735
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:15,270
请坐

1736
00:42:15,888 --> 00:42:16,388
谢谢

1737
00:42:19,374 --> 00:42:21,014
我要一碗提子麦麸

1738
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:21,522
很好！

1739
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:28,039
茶

1740
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,160
It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.

1741
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,400
I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law,

1742
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:35,115
你看起来很漂亮

1743
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,760
which this letter would definitely be doing.

1744
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:36,488
谢谢

1745
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,280
But you would do it?

1746
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,615
提子麦麸  牛奶

1747
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,200
I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family,

1748
00:42:45,547 --> 00:42:46,047
谢谢

1749
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,680
you should hear how I lost my job.

1750
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,320
How did you lose your job?

1751
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,800
By... having sex with everybody in the office.

1752
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,080
Everybody?

1753
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,520
I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.

1754
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:03,039
想分一点吗？

1755
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,240
We don't have to talk about it.

1756
00:43:03,997 --> 00:43:05,197
你为什么点提子麦麸？

1757
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,200
Thanks.

1758
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:08,444
你为什么点茶？

1759
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,360
How many were there?

1760
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,080
Eleven.

1761
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,720
Wow.

1762
00:43:10,474 --> 00:43:11,754
因为你点了提子麦麸

1763
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,560
I know.

1764
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,280
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

1765
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,656
我点这个是不想让你误会

1766
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:13,880
Okay.

1767
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:15,927
以为这是个约会

1768
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,120
Can I ask you one more question?

1769
00:43:17,572 --> 00:43:19,551
就算你点提子麦麸  这还是有可能是个约会

1770
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,320
Were there any women?

1771
00:43:19,928 --> 00:43:21,774
这不是约会

1772
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,360
Yes.

1773
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,240
Really?

1774
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,089
工作如何  跳舞什么的

1775
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,280
Yes.

1776
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,560
What was that like?

1777
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,437
挺好  你的限制令进行的怎么样了？

1778
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,120
Hot.

1779
00:43:27,915 --> 00:43:30,275
限制令可不是我的工作

1780
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:35,440
Jesus Christ. Was it like... older women,

1781
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:34,062
不过跟尼基重归于好这件事  进展还不错

1782
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,480
a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you-

1783
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:37,218
虽然在医生看来有点小摩擦

1784
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,600
Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.

1785
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,300
就是你声称被杠铃砸了的那次

1786
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,228
是啊  是跟我父母之间的问题

1787
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,440
What? You sat on her lap?

1788
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:46,083
我想写封信给尼基解释一下

1789
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,360
Mm-hmm.

1790
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,520
因为这事没什么大不了

1791
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,600
She told you what to do?

1792
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:47,440
Mm-hmm.

1793
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:51,174
我可以解释一下  告诉她我并没有失控

1794
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,240
Oh... my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this.

1795
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,920
Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.

1796
00:43:52,268 --> 00:43:54,097
我恢复得很好

1797
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,600
I don't mind it.

1798
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,040
You don't, do you.

1799
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,360
No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at

1800
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,200
work, and in the bathroom... and the boss called me in to his office and

1801
00:44:03,147 --> 00:44:05,054
我可以帮你捎信给尼基

1802
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:07,766
我偶尔会跟我姐一起去见她

1803
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,520
tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then

1804
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,960
they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.

1805
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:20,539
要是你能帮我捎信给尼基  实在感激不尽

1806
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,960
I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...

1807
00:44:21,674 --> 00:44:24,952
我得瞒着维罗妮卡  这封信可是犯法的

1808
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:27,448
她可不愿意沾上

1809
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,680
was in the shower with the history teacher...

1810
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:29,720
I heard about that.

1811
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:30,040
你不怕吧？

1812
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,640
... it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy.

1813
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,360
Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.

1814
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:37,284
我也得小心  我跟家里已经闹得够僵了

1815
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,480
Wow.

1816
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,040
Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.

1817
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,022
你也应该听说我是怎么丢了工作的

1818
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,840
你是怎么丢了工作的？

1819
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,680
Yeah.

1820
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:48,308
把所有同事睡了个遍

1821
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,560
So I know.

1822
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,000
You do.

1823
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,640
I just gotta get a strategy, you know?

1824
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,480
Me too.

1825
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:50,707
所有？

1826
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,120
We'd better get back to the letter.

1827
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,350
汤米死后  我很低落  我们办公室人不少

1828
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,480
Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

1829
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,840
What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?

1830
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:56,507
我们还是别聊这个吧

1831
00:44:56,589 --> 00:44:57,096
谢谢

1832
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,840
Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.

1833
00:44:57,512 --> 00:44:58,313
到底有多少个？

1834
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,056
11个

1835
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:00,726
了解

1836
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.

1837
00:45:02,418 --> 00:45:03,423
我不会再提这事了

1838
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,290
好

1839
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,160
Can I at least finish my tea?

1840
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:07,432
我能再问个问题吗？

1841
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,200
Wait, what?

1842
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,520
My tea. Can I finish it?

1843
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,120
Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner?

1844
00:45:10,176 --> 00:45:11,016
其中有女人吗？

1845
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,160
Why would she do that? Was it a test?

1846
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:13,612
有

1847
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:14,322
真的？

1848
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:15,121
真的

1849
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,360
I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

1850
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:17,388
感觉怎么样？

1851
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,520
Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do?

1852
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:18,907
爽

1853
00:45:19,572 --> 00:45:20,731
天啊

1854
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,280
I think I did pretty well.

1855
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:26,517
是不是那种…年纪大一点的

1856
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,920
Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.

1857
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,000
Basically? Was I some percentage not cool?

1858
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:29,708
性感女教师引诱你…

1859
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,680
No, she said you were cool, but you know.

1860
00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:31,931
让我坐在她腿上搞？是的

1861
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,880
No, I don't know.

1862
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:35,898
什么  坐在她腿上？

1863
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,840
Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.

1864
00:45:37,512 --> 00:45:38,472
她告诉你该怎么做？

1865
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,040
What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?

1866
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:44,064
天哪  尼基讨厌我这样讲话

1867
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,520
Sort of like me.

1868
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,240
"Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.

1869
00:45:44,866 --> 00:45:46,851
让我听起来像个变态  我们换个话题吧

1870
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:47,793
我无所谓的

1871
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,160
Why?

1872
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,200
你无所谓吧

1873
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,400
Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together,

1874
00:45:51,808 --> 00:45:56,689
无所谓  但后来他们就在上班时

1875
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,520
I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that.

1876
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,715
在停车场和盥洗室打了起来

1877
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,789
老板把我叫到办公室

1878
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,080
Especially after all the shit you just told me.

1879
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:08,337
把这些都怪到我头上  我就指控他性骚扰

1880
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,520
You think that I'm crazier than you.

1881
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,080
Because, well, we're different, I mean-

1882
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:12,935
他们就把我炒了  赶我回家  逼我吃药

1883
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,640
Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me.

1884
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:15,280
我懂的

1885
00:46:17,116 --> 00:46:20,532
我老婆跟那个教历史的一起洗澡时

1886
00:46:20,532 --> 00:46:22,493
正在放一首歌

1887
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,320
You know what? Forget I offered to help you.

1888
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:23,431
我听说了

1889
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:26,192
那是我婚礼上放的歌  我现在一听到就会抓狂

1890
00:46:26,646 --> 00:46:28,526
有时候  明明没在放  我脑子里还是会听到

1891
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,520
Forget the entire fucking idea. Cause that must have been

1892
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,000
fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.

1893
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:34,923
他们就把我关进医院  这很丢人

1894
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,000
Keep your voice down.

1895
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,580
所以我能理解

1896
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,040
I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!

1897
00:46:38,346 --> 00:46:39,053
是的

1898
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,200
Forget it!

1899
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:42,093
我得想个对策

1900
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,080
Shut the fuck up.

1901
00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:43,689
我也是

1902
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,960
Fuck you!

1903
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,720
You shut the fuck up!

1904
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:46,662
我们还是说回那封信吧

1905
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,680
Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!

1906
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,090
好  说回那封信

1907
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:51,293
你趁着维罗妮卡上厕所时告诉尼基怎么样？

1908
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:57,358
对  这主意不错

1909
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,600
Slow down, Raisin Bran.

1910
00:46:57,775 --> 00:47:00,175
天哪  我得赶紧回家写信

1911
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,760
Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?

1912
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:01,866
起码得等我把茶喝完吧？

1913
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:02,951
什么？

1914
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,560
Yes, you do.

1915
00:47:03,373 --> 00:47:04,336
茶  能让我喝完吗？

1916
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,200
No, I don't.

1917
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,135
慢着

1918
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,160
You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness

1919
00:47:06,135 --> 00:47:08,096
维罗妮卡有没有把我们吃晚餐的事告诉尼基？

1920
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,240
category, didn't you?

1921
00:47:09,256 --> 00:47:11,273
她为什么要那么做  那是个测试吗？

1922
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,520
What? Hey, calm down! Hey-

1923
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,320
Just leave me alone!

1924
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,080
Can I just explain myself, please?

1925
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,614
我也这么觉得

1926
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,920
I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of

1927
00:47:13,991 --> 00:47:18,912
该死  我就知道那是个测试  我做得怎么样？

1928
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,880
sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?

1929
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,680
You may not have experienced the shit that I did.

1930
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:19,737
我觉得还不错

1931
00:47:20,024 --> 00:47:21,625
她说你算是很冷静

1932
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,840
But you loved hearing about it, didn't you?

1933
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:25,679
算是？ 那就是还有几分不冷静了？

1934
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,600
You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.

1935
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,551
不  她说你很冷静  不过  你懂的

1936
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,400
You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me.

1937
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,819
不懂

1938
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:35,961
就是你的本性嘛  没事的  别担心

1939
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,920
You are an asshole. You are an asshole!

1940
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,000
Get off of me!  Get off!

1941
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,653
什么叫我的本性  什么意思？

1942
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,040
You're harassing me!

1943
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:39,836
就跟我差不多

1944
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,520
Hey, hey!

1945
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:45,741
跟你差不多？ 但愿她没跟尼基这么说

1946
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,160
He's harassing me!

1947
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,200
Get off!

1948
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,520
Take it easy. Dude, relax.

1949
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,400
He's harassing me!!

1950
00:47:47,387 --> 00:47:47,887
为什么？

1951
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,360
Bro, get off of me.

1952
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:53,216
因为  把你跟我混为一谈  这不太对

1953
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,400
He's harassing me!!

1954
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,400
Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right?

1955
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,400
Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up.

1956
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:57,522
这就是不对  尼基听了会不高兴的

1957
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,360
Stop it.

1958
00:47:59,237 --> 00:48:01,117
尤其是你刚才跟我说了那些破事之后

1959
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:05,844
你觉得我比你更疯

1960
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:10,612
因为  那个  我们是不一样的

1961
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,640
Hey, hey, hey, get off me!

1962
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,480
What are you doing? Come on. What are you doing?

1963
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:17,461
天哪  你好狠啊

1964
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,400
What are you doing to these kids?

1965
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,200
Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids?

1966
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,240
You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do?

1967
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,080
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-

1968
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:25,446
知道吗  别指望我帮你了

1969
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,200
It's the kids!

1970
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,600
Honestly He didn't do anything, it was all the kids.

1971
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:29,827
忘掉这个该死的主意吧  实在太荒唐了

1972
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,520
Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here.

1973
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:34,514
因为我比你疯得多

1974
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,880
Come on man what you gonna do about that song? You gonna go your whole life scared of that song?

1975
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:35,566
小声点

1976
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:38,729
我就是个死了丈夫的骚货！

1977
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,360
It's just a song. Don't make it a monster.

1978
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:40,968
去死吧!

1979
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,320
Come on breath! There's no song playing. There's no song.

1980
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,131
你闭嘴！

1981
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:42,787
去你妈的！

1982
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,671
你才闭嘴！

1983
00:48:46,098 --> 00:48:46,978
蒂芙尼！

1984
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,280
That's it.

1985
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,440
That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1986
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,201
慢着  提子麦麸

1987
00:49:00,033 --> 00:49:03,455
等等  我没觉得你疯

1988
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,560
I'm sorry.

1989
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,298
你就是觉得

1990
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,400
I took it too far.

1991
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:05,034
我没有

1992
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:06,960
I'm sorry.

1993
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:08,056
你跟你的心理医生说

1994
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,120
Hey, is he messing with you?

1995
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:09,230
你的精神病比较高级  对不对？

1996
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,400
No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started.

1997
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,509
什么  冷静点

1998
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,480
There's a restraining order on this guy.

1999
00:49:10,711 --> 00:49:11,512
离我远点！

2000
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,720
I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.

2001
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:13,183
能听我解释一下吗？

2002
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,560
That's not a good thing to do.

2003
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:17,143
我不想让尼基觉得我会跟那种…

2004
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,680
Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.

2005
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,960
You're Tommy's widow, right?

2006
00:49:17,143 --> 00:49:17,990
不正当的性行为扯上关系

2007
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,800
Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.

2008
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,876
因为我从来就没做过那种事

2009
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:22,144
你是没做过

2010
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,760
You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime?

2011
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:24,566
但倒是挺爱听的  不是吗？

2012
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:28,151
你没胆子活出自我  没胆子做自己

2013
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,480
What'd I say? She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.

2014
00:49:28,164 --> 00:49:30,379
你是个伪君子

2015
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:33,393
只敢随大流  你是个骗子

2016
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,805
我对你敞开心扉  你却瞧不起我

2017
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:38,016
你这个混球  你这个混球！

2018
00:49:38,606 --> 00:49:40,190
放开我！

2019
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:41,374
你在骚扰我！

2020
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,440
I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.

2021
00:49:43,018 --> 00:49:43,738
他在骚扰我！

2022
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,840
I know. I know you didn't mean it.

2023
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:46,702
滚开！

2024
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,042
放松点  老兄  别惹事

2025
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,160
I didn't mean it at all.

2026
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:48,966
他在骚扰我！！

2027
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,000
I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.

2028
00:49:49,145 --> 00:49:50,980
兄弟  放开我

2029
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,480
All the time. I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry.

2030
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:52,063
他在骚扰我！！

2031
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:54,164
别这样  别这样  好吗？

2032
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,040
Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.

2033
00:49:54,352 --> 00:49:59,367
放开我  闭嘴

2034
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,040
I know you do.

2035
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:00,389
别这样

2036
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:08,160
You do? Yeah, sure. I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?

2037
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,480
I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing.

2038
00:50:11,202 --> 00:50:13,208
放开我！

2039
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:15,164
你在干什么  你在干什么？

2040
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,680
Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of em took it.

2041
00:50:15,237 --> 00:50:16,076
你跟这些小孩闹什么？

2042
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:17,922
跟他们一起扮万圣节流氓吗？

2043
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,520
That's the only answer. No, no, no.

2044
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,064
你想回巴尔的摩吗  你想吗？

2045
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,280
Dolores, somebody was in my study. Who took one of my envelopes?

2046
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:21,249
不想  不想

2047
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,320
Somebody took an envelope.

2048
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,520
Maybe we should call the FBI.

2049
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:29,412
是那些小孩的错！

2050
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,840
Don't make fun. This is serious.

2051
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:32,099
他真的什么都没做  都是那些小孩搞的鬼

2052
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,400
What FBI? Come on, let's take a look. I'll show you what this is.

2053
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,680
I'm gonna just explain to you something. I mean, you know what

2054
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:35,998
走吧  走吧  没什么好看的

2055
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,200
I'm doing, honey. This everything, like this.

2056
00:50:36,023 --> 00:50:38,787
你打算拿那首歌怎么办？

2057
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,600
I got this, it all corresponds.

2058
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,574
难不成要怕它一辈子吗？

2059
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,720
Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes.

2060
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,480
I hope that's not a problem

2061
00:50:41,645 --> 00:50:43,138
不过是首歌  别把它想象成梦魇

2062
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,960
No, it's not okay. It's not okay. You gotta ask.

2063
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,960
Do not go in my study or I will eat you!?

2064
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:48,618
深呼吸  那首歌没在放  没在放

2065
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,800
It's not funny, it's not funny.

2066
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,480
What's everybody making a joke out of this for?

2067
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,000
Dolores, you are so beautiful!

2068
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:51,199
那首歌没在放

2069
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,480
Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!

2070
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,840
Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day

2071
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,600
after games with a lot of cash in

2072
00:50:57,361 --> 00:50:58,685
就这样

2073
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,200
em. So show some respect for what I do.

2074
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:07,205
就这样  很好  对不起

2075
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,680
Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four.

2076
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,600
I just wanted to tell you the number.

2077
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,280
Thank you.

2078
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,200
But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping.

2079
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,320
I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope.

2080
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,560
You didn't want to wake me? He didn't want to wake me.

2081
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:08,494
对不起

2082
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,000
He doesn't have a problem complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway.

2083
00:51:09,795 --> 00:51:10,515
是我反应过度了

2084
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:11,894
对不起

2085
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,960
He doesn't have a problem asking for his wedding video-

2086
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:13,125
他骚扰你了吗？

2087
00:51:13,662 --> 00:51:15,481
没有  我开玩笑的

2088
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,880
Be nice. It's game day! I'm makin crabby snacks and homemades.

2089
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:17,662
这家伙有人身限制令呢

2090
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,880
Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come on, she's making crabby snacks and

2091
00:51:17,893 --> 00:51:18,954
我知道  我玩笑开的过头了

2092
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,640
homemades. Come on, Dad!

2093
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:19,855
这种玩笑可开不得

2094
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:22,101
我玩砸了呗  你还要我怎样  对不起

2095
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,320
What are you so up about?

2096
00:51:22,602 --> 00:51:23,718
你是汤米的遗孀吧？

2097
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,680
He's very happy. I'm happy.

2098
00:51:23,743 --> 00:51:25,683
没错  我就是汤米的疯骚遗孀

2099
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,840
No, you're so up, up, up, up.

2100
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,577
不过“骚”字能免则免吧

2101
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,760
Isn't that a good thing?

2102
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:31,529
这妹子有意思  有空喝一杯吗？

2103
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,360
You're just up, up, up. I don't know what that is.

2104
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,600
Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication?

2105
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,480
Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am.

2106
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:37,205
- 我说错什么了？ - 她不会再做那种事了

2107
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,120
Okay. Taking a little bit too many or something?

2108
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,480
No, if I was taking that, I'd be on the floor, Dad.

2109
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,280
Just stay with us. Stay for the game. Spend some family time.

2110
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,400
Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.

2111
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,120
Spend family time. Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?

2112
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,320
Come on, your dad needs a winner. Help him out.

2113
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,560
Come on. I can't. It's the Seahawks.

2114
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:52,021
对不起  我不该说那种话

2115
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,720
Put on the jersey and stay, please. Please. It's important, please.

2116
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:54,536
我知道  我知道你不是那意思

2117
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:56,011
我真的不是那意思

2118
00:51:56,276 --> 00:51:57,814
我知道  你讲的鬼话从来都言不由衷

2119
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,200
What are you up to, Pat? Nothing, come on.

2120
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,634
- 都不是 - 放心  尼基的信我会帮你捎的

2121
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,200
What's in the envelope?

2122
00:52:01,842 --> 00:52:04,131
太谢谢你了  蒂芙尼

2123
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,480
Yeah, what are you doing? What's in that envelope?

2124
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,240
Guys, I'm beating the song! I'm on the scoreboard!

2125
00:52:05,476 --> 00:52:06,201
我知道

2126
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,600
I'm playing down field! I feel great!

2127
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:11,420
- 是吗 - 是啊

2128
00:52:13,435 --> 00:52:16,420
那明天见吧  我把信给你

2129
00:52:19,677 --> 00:52:21,757
只要少了一个  我就肯定知道

2130
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:25,661
可能多洛蕾丝或者帕特拿了一个信封

2131
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,160
Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?

2132
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,520
What do you want with her?

2133
00:52:26,401 --> 00:52:28,606
- 肯定是这样 - 不会的

2134
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,240
Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.

2135
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,840
Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.

2136
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:32,539
有人进我书房了吗？ 我少了个信封

2137
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,720
Oh, great, a married creep. I'm her friend.

2138
00:52:32,964 --> 00:52:34,004
有人拿了个信封

2139
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,360
We go running. Have you guys not seen us? I took her to the diner.

2140
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:36,974
问问联邦调查局吧

2141
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,120
She's not here.

2142
00:52:37,392 --> 00:52:38,672
别开玩笑  我说真的

2143
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,200
Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home? Go away.

2144
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,080
I know her. I know her, we've dated. We still date.

2145
00:52:39,145 --> 00:52:42,050
什么联邦调查局？ 来看个究竟吧

2146
00:52:42,301 --> 00:52:45,388
听我给你解释一下 你知道我在干什么

2147
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,520
What are you doing here? I've called her, I've texted her.

2148
00:52:45,388 --> 00:52:47,059
亲爱的  东西都在这儿

2149
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,600
I still haven't heard back. We used to work together-

2150
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,880
Just get the hell out of here...

2151
00:52:47,326 --> 00:52:48,566
都是信

2152
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,880
I just wanted to give you my card to give to her.

2153
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:49,681
爸  我借你的信封用用

2154
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,320
Another rude creep. Listen to what he's saying.

2155
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:50,456
你不介意吧

2156
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,400
Listen to what he's saying. What's he saying?

2157
00:52:50,616 --> 00:52:53,068
不行  你起码得先问问我

2158
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,240
He's saying you're being rude.

2159
00:52:53,276 --> 00:52:55,135
“入我书房者  杀无赦！”

2160
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,680
How am I being rude?

2161
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,000
Oh, you know. You know. Come on.

2162
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,024
开什么玩笑

2163
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,040
Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and sometimes -

2164
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,752
这有什么好笑的？

2165
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,320
-it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt,

2166
00:52:57,997 --> 00:53:00,379
多洛蕾丝  你真是我的女神！

2167
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,320
and they're an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case,

2168
00:53:00,551 --> 00:53:02,978
别闹  我说了  别闹！

2169
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,800
I think that wing is being fixed.

2170
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:08,403
赛后每天都有很多信封进出我办公室

2171
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,720
And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're gettin' in the

2172
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,760
way of that right now, okay? Because she's sensitive and she's

2173
00:53:08,403 --> 00:53:09,365
里面装着现金

2174
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,120
smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl and you gotta be

2175
00:53:09,616 --> 00:53:11,217
请尊重我的事情

2176
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,680
respectful of that. Come on.

2177
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:12,576
我知道  我看见上面写着274

2178
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,040
Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this.

2179
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:13,531
我只是来把数目告诉你

2180
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:14,236
谢谢

2181
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:16,120
但信封是空的  很抱歉  你在睡觉

2182
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,720
I can see it in your eyes. She just texted me!

2183
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:17,406
我不想吵醒你  可我需要一个信封

2184
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:19,735
你还不想吵醒我？ 他还不想吵醒我

2185
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:23,353
他不想跟我唠叨什么海明威

2186
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,366
他不想找我要什么婚礼录像

2187
00:53:25,713 --> 00:53:27,363
别计较了  今天是比赛日  我去给你们做点心

2188
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,400
Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened?

2189
00:53:27,592 --> 00:53:32,022
爸  别计较了  有点心呢

2190
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,200
How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?

2191
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:33,294
来吧  爸！

2192
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:34,840
I can't, I can't do it.

2193
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,151
你怎么这么兴奋？

2194
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,880
What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?

2195
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:37,604
- 他很开心啊 - 我很开心

2196
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,160
I can't give the letter to Nikki.

2197
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,160
Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't

2198
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:38,898
不  你看起来过于兴奋了

2199
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:39,896
这不好吗？

2200
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,560
give the letter to Nikki? Because what am I getting in return?

2201
00:53:39,908 --> 00:53:42,501
你兴奋成那样  我却不知道你在乐什么

2202
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,520
What are you doing for me? You said! You said if I wrote a letter,

2203
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:44,826
你用药没缺斤少两吧？

2204
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,200
you'd get it to Nikki. I know. That was the set-up.

2205
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,182
我的用药量？ 当然没错

2206
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,800
Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for

2207
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:50,571
那你是药吃多了还是怎样？

2208
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,720
other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!

2209
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:53,031
要是我吃多了  早就趴下了

2210
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:55,936
待在家里看看比赛  享受一下天伦之乐

2211
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,160
What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to

2212
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:57,121
爸  不行  我要走了

2213
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,680
me. Why don't you just do things on your own?

2214
00:53:57,281 --> 00:54:00,980
天伦之乐？ 你是指你的强迫症和运气论？

2215
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,760
I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give

2216
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,640
everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get

2217
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:03,290
拜托  你爸需要一个胜场  帮帮他吧

2218
00:54:03,745 --> 00:54:05,611
- 不行 - 对手是海鹰队

2219
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,000
what I want, okay? I'm not my sister.

2220
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:08,249
把球衣穿上  留下来  拜托了

2221
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:12,016
这场球很重要  拜托了

2222
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:13,795
- 你要去干嘛  帕特？ - 没什么

2223
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,520
Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?

2224
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:14,803
信封里装着什么？

2225
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,001
你要干什么？ 信封里是什么东西？

2226
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,520
I can't do it. Tiffany, what do you want me to do?

2227
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:19,898
我要打败那首歌  我已经领先了！

2228
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:22,366
我要赢到底  加油！

2229
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,560
Think of something. There's this thing.

2230
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,280
There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?

2231
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,360
It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.

2232
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,200
It's a dance thing, all right.

2233
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,360
It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.

2234
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,280
Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.

2235
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,400
Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.

2236
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:39,631
你好吗？ 蒂芙尼在吗？

2237
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,120
Would you please! I don't have a filter when I talk.

2238
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,800
Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my

2239
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:41,018
你找她干什么？

2240
00:54:41,186 --> 00:54:43,880
又是个变态  你想干嘛  滚开

2241
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,720
goddamn husband is dead?

2242
00:54:44,146 --> 00:54:45,530
不是那么回事  我结婚了

2243
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,800
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

2244
00:54:45,788 --> 00:54:48,524
- 好  已婚变态 - 我是她朋友

2245
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,200
But I can only do it if I have a partner... and now I'm about to miss

2246
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:49,887
我们一起跑步  你们没见过吗？

2247
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:50,560
it for another year.

2248
00:54:50,411 --> 00:54:51,043
她不在

2249
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you.

2250
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,272
- 你们好  蒂芙尼在吗？ - 滚开

2251
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,440
What are you talking about?

2252
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,120
What, your schedule is so busy? Grapes of Wrath?and watching

2253
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,409
我认识她的  真的  我们交往过

2254
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,120
football with your dad?

2255
00:54:57,409 --> 00:54:58,288
现在还在交往

2256
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,560
Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.

2257
00:54:58,313 --> 00:54:59,803
- 你来这干嘛？ - 我给她打过电话  发过短信

2258
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,760
All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.

2259
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,938
她一直没回  我们以前是同事

2260
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,840
Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.

2261
00:55:01,963 --> 00:55:03,318
给我赶紧滚

2262
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Think about it.

2263
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:04,339
请把我的名片转交给她

2264
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:05,865
- 又是个无礼的变态 - 听听他在说什么

2265
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,720
Well, I already did do something for you, you know.

2266
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:06,983
听听他在说什么  他怎么说的？

2267
00:55:07,128 --> 00:55:07,866
他说你很无礼

2268
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:08,692
我怎么无礼了？

2269
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,520
I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.

2270
00:55:08,828 --> 00:55:09,697
你自己知道

2271
00:55:09,863 --> 00:55:12,903
有的姑娘只想玩玩  你跟她们玩玩没问题

2272
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,520
What? Jordie?

2273
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,258
有的姑娘不行  她们受了伤  感情很脆弱

2274
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,520
Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely?

2275
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,600
That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.

2276
00:55:15,408 --> 00:55:18,373
不能趁虚而入  至于这个姑娘

2277
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,120
Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?

2278
00:55:18,543 --> 00:55:19,923
我想她的伤口正在自愈

2279
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,680
It's not at all like me and Nikki.

2280
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,678
你应该帮她完全复原  你现在有机会

2281
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,280
What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married.

2282
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,280
It's completely different.

2283
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:26,215
她很敏感  很聪明

2284
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,840
How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love.

2285
00:55:26,215 --> 00:55:27,552
又有艺术天分  她是个好姑娘

2286
00:55:27,678 --> 00:55:29,176
你应该要尊重她  走吧

2287
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,040
Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.

2288
00:55:29,658 --> 00:55:31,623
我送你回你的车里去  你不是那种混蛋

2289
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,560
We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel

2290
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:33,604
- 我看得出来 - 她刚刚发了短信给我！

2291
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,640
awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.

2292
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,880
Wow. It's electric between us,

2293
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,600
Okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that,

2294
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,600
I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to

2295
00:55:43,555 --> 00:55:45,593
等等！你在干嘛？

2296
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,200
stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose

2297
00:55:45,606 --> 00:55:47,655
怎么回事？

2298
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,584
你为什么不出来  到底怎么回事？

2299
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,920
weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done.

2300
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:51,245
不行  我办不到

2301
00:55:51,397 --> 00:55:52,298
什么意思  你办不到什么？

2302
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,680
I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a

2303
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:54,643
我不能捎信给尼基

2304
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,520
couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me.

2305
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:59,748
蒂芙尼  为什么不能捎信给尼基？

2306
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,680
She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good

2307
00:55:59,748 --> 00:56:00,453
我这么做有什么好处呢？

2308
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,360
thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think

2309
00:56:00,468 --> 00:56:03,393
- 你为我做过什么？ - 你说只要我写信

2310
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,000
she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.

2311
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,159
- 你就捎给尼基  说好了的 - 我知道

2312
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:09,434
因为我总干蠢事  我总为别人做这做那

2313
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,840
It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna

2314
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,040
be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take

2315
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:13,225
到头来发现自己什么都没有

2316
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,960
advantage of a situation without offering to do something back.

2317
00:56:13,225 --> 00:56:16,066
你瞎说什么呢  你明明看起来很强势

2318
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,360
So think about the dance thing.

2319
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:17,133
怎么会不为自己考虑呢？

2320
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,294
我老是把自己搞得那么狼狈

2321
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:23,331
替别人两肋插刀  却从来没有人…

2322
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,080
Danny, you're out of the hospital? And you're here on game day?

2323
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:27,889
我没法事事如愿  好吗？ 我不像我姐姐

2324
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,120
I'm out. It's official, man. They didn't convert me to my

2325
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,320
Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length

2326
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:35,202
好吧  那我问你  我又能为你做什么？

2327
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,520
of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They had to let me go.

2328
00:56:36,864 --> 00:56:41,230
- 我办不到 - 蒂芙尼  你想让我做什么？

2329
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,840
I never understand what he's saying.

2330
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,000
Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on, let's come back and sit down the

2331
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,880
way you were before.

2332
00:56:43,132 --> 00:56:45,313
- 想想吧 - 有件事

2333
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,960
What a treat! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here?

2334
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,615
有件事  什么事？

2335
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,880
Oh, yeah. He calls me Jailhouse Lawyer. ?

2336
00:56:48,591 --> 00:56:51,348
是件…是件跳舞的事

2337
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,080
Hold the remote the way you were holding it before.

2338
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,560
Okay. And now you're holding the remote?

2339
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:53,355
跳舞的事  好

2340
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,360
And it's working. Your dad's a genius.

2341
00:56:53,418 --> 00:56:55,619
是富兰克林酒店的比赛

2342
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,040
Now sit up. And Danny's the good luck charm?

2343
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,523
汤米以前从不陪我去  我年年都去不了

2344
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,680
Danny's from you. This is your house, so it comes down to you.

2345
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,694
汤米死了更去不了了

2346
00:56:58,824 --> 00:57:01,513
- 你有必要吗！ - 我讲话老是没遮没拦

2347
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,680
You're the one. Yeah, you're the one, Pat.

2348
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:03,273
你能不能别总提

2349
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,480
Superstition, Danny. I don't know.

2350
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:04,211
我死了丈夫这破事？

2351
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,200
Come sit down.

2352
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,063
好吧  对不起

2353
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,920
Don't disappear doing God knows what with that Tiffany Maxwell.

2354
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:09,357
但我得有舞伴才能参加比赛

2355
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,760
Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend. Why would you say that?

2356
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,269
不然今年又得错过了

2357
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,720
Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful. She goes to a lot of therapy.

2358
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:13,441
我才不会跟你去跳舞

2359
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,480
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say?

2360
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:14,536
你瞎说什么呢？

2361
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:17,767
你有什么要忙的？ 看《愤怒的葡萄》

2362
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
I'm just saying- Am I messed up?

2363
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,951
还是陪你爸看球？

2364
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,840
Why don't you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You're the one

2365
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:20,738
蒂芙尼  我不会跟你去跳什么舞的

2366
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,840
who has a messed up marriage.

2367
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:21,775
那好  我也不会帮你捎什么信的

2368
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,360
I'm just looking out for you, I'm just looking out for you. She's unstable.

2369
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,911
等等  你答应了的

2370
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,600
What's wrong with your marriage? What's wrong with your marriage?

2371
00:57:24,556 --> 00:57:25,597
想想看吧

2372
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,200
Nothing's wrong!

2373
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,920
You should have seen when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there.

2374
00:57:26,852 --> 00:57:28,892
我已经帮你做了件事了

2375
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,000
Shh, shh. What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this.

2376
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:30,459
你为我做了什么

2377
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,760
You need to deal with it. Stop breaking my balls.

2378
00:57:30,459 --> 00:57:32,267
我帮你赶走了你家门口那个变态

2379
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,280
Oh!!!! I got you an iPod. Whoa! Is this for me?

2380
00:57:32,517 --> 00:57:33,302
谁？你说乔迪？

2381
00:57:33,629 --> 00:57:36,029
你是不是一空虚了就打电话找他？

2382
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,040
Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but-

2383
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,600
Oh, buddy, thank you. That's so nice of you. Wow.

2384
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:39,647
那只会让他得寸进尺  你不该这么做

2385
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,440
Thirty-two gigabytes. How many songs is that? Seven thousand.

2386
00:57:39,967 --> 00:57:41,784
你跟尼基不也这样吗？

2387
00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:42,847
我跟尼基根本就不是这样

2388
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,600
Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers. You love The Stranglers.

2389
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:44,537
你胡说什么  我们相爱  我们是夫妻

2390
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,080
Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash. Got some Clash.

2391
00:57:44,887 --> 00:57:45,592
这完全不一样

2392
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:48,616
你们怎么相爱的  给我讲讲吧

2393
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,640
Oh, West Side Story. ?Yeah, West Side Story. ?It makes me peaceful.

2394
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:51,006
你跟尼基的爱情故事

2395
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:52,814
给我讲讲  我不明白

2396
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,880
Maria, I just met a girl named Maria... ? Right, right, right.

2397
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:57,158
我们之间十分不寻常  这让别人觉得不舒服

2398
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,560
And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the

2399
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:08,360
garage... Metallica... Megadeth. I start fucking smashing shit.

2400
00:57:57,158 --> 00:57:59,510
但我不会  她是我交往过的最美的姑娘

2401
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:02,865
我们之间是有火花的

2402
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:05,216
没错  我们也想改变对方

2403
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,453
但这很正常  每对情侣都这样

2404
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,400
You gotta get your marriage together.

2405
00:58:07,453 --> 00:58:08,844
我想改变她的穿衣风格

2406
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,800
I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand. And -

2407
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,778
我想让她别再对我指手画脚  她想让我减肥

2408
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,080
Ronnie, that's fucked up. Yeah, but it makes me feel better.

2409
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:15,442
别再乱发脾气  我也正在为之努力

2410
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,840
It's like my therapy, you know?

2411
00:58:15,582 --> 00:58:17,845
不和是人之常情  每对情侣都有不和

2412
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,920
When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that...

2413
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:19,718
我们也会  我们会几个礼拜不说话

2414
00:58:19,718 --> 00:58:22,042
这很正常  她总想让我做得更好

2415
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,560
Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki?

2416
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:24,275
她想让我变得更有热情  更有同情心

2417
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Pan from the framed photo of Jake on foyer wall, to Jake on the stairs above.

2418
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:26,367
这是好事  你明白吗？

2419
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,040
A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro. Holy shit, look at you! You

2420
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:28,197
我为她变成了一个更好的人

2421
00:58:28,197 --> 00:58:30,163
我想她也是  我们的爱情会妙不可言

2422
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,200
are fit! You look absolutely amazing. You feel good?

2423
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,007
妙不可言  你会妙不可言  她会妙不可言

2424
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,160
How you doing, Jake? Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.

2425
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:38,987
你别想什么都不做就让我捎信

2426
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,760
Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?

2427
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,240
So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital.

2428
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:40,469
还是考虑一下跳舞的事吧

2429
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,040
You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding.

2430
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,080
I've been helping Pop with the restaurant cause he needs to have

2431
00:58:47,811 --> 00:58:50,025
丹尼  你出院了？ 你来看比赛的吗？

2432
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,000
a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that

2433
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,988
我出院了  正式的

2434
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,960
he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him. And

2435
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,560
then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm.

2436
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,855
他们没在我三分之二的刑期上限内

2437
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,640
Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife,

2438
00:58:56,855 --> 00:59:00,896
把我转入精神卫生法许可状态

2439
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:02,756
就放我出来了  他们别无选择

2440
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,240
I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind

2441
00:59:03,443 --> 00:59:04,345
我从来听不懂他说什么

2442
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,636
狱房律师  来  回来坐下

2443
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,000
of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your

2444
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:07,577
像以前一样

2445
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:11,786
太棒了  爸爸让你坐这儿的？

2446
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,280
job, things are going great for me at the firm.

2447
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:14,099
- 是啊 - 他管我叫“狱房律师”

2448
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,040
Maybe stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad

2449
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,690
拿着遥控板  跟以前一样

2450
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,200
for him. Just, you know, leave it alone. We're watching the game.

2451
00:59:17,248 --> 00:59:18,377
好  现在遥控板归你来拿了？

2452
00:59:18,377 --> 00:59:20,592
这很管用的  你爸爸是个天才

2453
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,840
You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop

2454
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:23,333
- 坐这 - 丹尼也是福星？

2455
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,360
talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth.

2456
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,148
从你身上沾来的  这是你家  在你身上

2457
00:59:26,435 --> 00:59:28,190
- 你才是福星 - 没错  你才是福星  帕特

2458
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:38,120
As my friend Danny would say I got nothing but love for you, brother.

2459
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:30,035
少迷信了  丹尼

2460
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:30,824
过来坐下

2461
00:59:31,495 --> 00:59:33,660
别又溜去跟那个蒂芙尼・麦克斯维尔鬼混

2462
00:59:33,835 --> 00:59:36,590
爸  她是我朋友  你是什么意思？

2463
00:59:37,475 --> 00:59:39,708
她是个大麻烦  小心点  她常去看心理医生

2464
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,568
我也常去  罗尼  你这话是什么意思？

2465
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
That's right. That's right. That's nice. That's nice.

2466
00:59:42,937 --> 00:59:44,217
- 我只是想说… - 我也是个大麻烦吗？

2467
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:47,135
你凭什么指责别人？谁都看不顺眼

2468
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,440
Well, thank God, finally. DeSean Jackson. Yeah. Did it fit?

2469
00:59:47,285 --> 00:59:48,151
你自己的婚姻不还是一团糟

2470
00:59:48,246 --> 00:59:49,744
我只是给你提个醒

2471
00:59:49,914 --> 00:59:51,029
你婚姻怎么了？

2472
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,360
I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.

2473
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:51,815
没怎么了！

2474
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:53,157
你要是跟我一起去他家看看就知道了

2475
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,080
Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.

2476
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:54,511
简直就像个马戏团

2477
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,760
Veronica didn't like it. Veronica hates the jersey.

2478
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:56,666
你说什么呢？ 不要藏着掖着

2479
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,000
Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay?

2480
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,512
- 你总要面对的 - 别给我找麻烦了

2481
00:59:58,684 --> 01:00:02,155
- 我给你带了个iPod - 是给我的吗？

2482
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,240
Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.

2483
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,009
是的  这是我以前用过的  不过…

2484
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,480
Pat, you're up to something, I know.

2485
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:06,686
老兄  谢谢你  你太够意思了

2486
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,760
People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that

2487
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:08,381
- 32G容量 - 能装多少歌？

2488
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:09,635
7000首

2489
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,880
you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we

2490
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:13,022
“行刑者”  你喜欢“行刑者”

2491
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,200
understand something because we're more-

2492
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:16,553
- “性手枪”  “冲击” - 有几首“冲击”的

2493
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,000
We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it. Everybody's

2494
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:15,880
just not in touch with it.

2495
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,360
Oh, no. How you doing, Pat? Jesus.

2496
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:18,656
- 《西区故事》 - 没错  《西区故事》

2497
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,080
I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming.

2498
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:20,291
能舒缓心情

2499
01:00:20,446 --> 01:00:22,605
- 我认识了个姑娘  她叫玛利亚… - 没错

2500
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,480
I'm taking him back to the hospital.

2501
01:00:22,754 --> 01:00:25,386
最近每当我怒火中烧的时候

2502
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,920
What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?

2503
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,400
First of all, check with the latest legal development.

2504
01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:32,631
我就躲进车库听重金属砸东西

2505
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,520
Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law

2506
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,640
admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so... .

2507
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,400
Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan?

2508
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,800
I'm an Eagles fan.

2509
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:37,756
你得把婚姻料理好

2510
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,120
Well then, what's the problem? He's not goin' anywhere. Just let him

2511
01:00:37,906 --> 01:00:41,293
我开始砸东西  把手都砸伤了

2512
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,080
finish the game, that's all. The handkerchief is working. We're

2513
01:00:41,426 --> 01:00:45,610
- 罗尼  这糟透了 - 可这能让我好过点

2514
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,920
killing the Seahawks, twenty-seventen.

2515
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,920
What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please!

2516
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,738
这就是我的心理治疗  懂吗？

2517
01:00:47,051 --> 01:00:49,761
我跟尼基在一起的时候  从来不会做这些…

2518
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,200
I don't know what the hell you're talking about the handkerchief?

2519
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:51,836
尼基？ 怎么扯到尼基了？

2520
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,640
And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I

2521
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,520
gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest

2522
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,684
老弟  限制令可不是闹着玩的

2523
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,640
his case from Baltimore.

2524
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:59,251
天哪  瞧瞧你啊！

2525
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,240
Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct.

2526
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:02,548
你瘦了  看起来好极了  感觉怎么样？

2527
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,920
Come on. You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

2528
01:01:02,998 --> 01:01:04,807
你好吗  杰克？

2529
01:01:04,807 --> 01:01:06,108
很好  你看上去像施瓦辛格

2530
01:01:06,108 --> 01:01:09,569
我不是说了吗  我差点没认出他来

2531
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:13,021
很抱歉我没去医院看你

2532
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:17,015
我一去那种地方就不自在  公司又在扩张

2533
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,135
我在帮爸爸开餐馆  因为他得做个合法生意

2534
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:20,713
他需要纳税申报单

2535
01:01:20,726 --> 01:01:22,166
赌球挣了那么多钱

2536
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,840
I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors

2537
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:24,206
他们肯定会找上门来

2538
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:26,429
那样的话  表面上那些钱就是我赚的

2539
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,200
are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers. Wow.

2540
01:01:26,429 --> 01:01:27,052
我们算是合作伙伴

2541
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's

2542
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:32,229
我不知道还能说些什么  你老婆丢了

2543
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,520
fun. And the walls are good cause I can play music really loud

2544
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:38,154
而我要订婚了 我还有很多这类事情可以告诉你

2545
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,840
without anybody hearing. Where do you sleep?

2546
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,360
Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was

2547
01:01:38,154 --> 01:01:43,031
你丢了房子  而我要买新房子了

2548
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,000
thinking about putting a ballet barre here.

2549
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:46,336
你丢了工作  我的公司却蒸蒸日上

2550
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,800
When are you gonna give it to her?

2551
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:56,240
What?

2552
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,267
别再讲什么你过得有多好  他过得多不好

2553
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,720
The letter to Nikki.

2554
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:51,574
别管这些了  我们在看球呢

2555
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,320
Probably tonight. Really?

2556
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:54,308
知道吗  我不多嘴了

2557
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,600
Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.

2558
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:55,896
我还是闭嘴吧

2559
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,400
Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about

2560
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,880
Shakespeare and how it's very romantic-

2561
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Mm-hmm. -and that maybe in the future if

2562
01:02:00,686 --> 01:02:02,629
就像我朋友丹尼会说的那样

2563
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,920
she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the

2564
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,320
training that-No, that's good, that's really good.

2565
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,360
I assume you're a good teacher.

2566
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,600
Yeah. I mean, I hope so.

2567
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,600
Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?

2568
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,800
我对你只有崇敬之情  哥哥

2569
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,800
And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.

2570
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,600
Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.

2571
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,680
You know, being of service.

2572
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,000
Yeah. To your need. Uh-huh.

2573
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:18,591
很好  很好

2574
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,680
All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me.

2575
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,120
Walk across the room.

2576
01:02:19,021 --> 01:02:20,708
谢天谢地  终于没事了

2577
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:24,141
- 德肖恩・杰克逊 - 合身吗？

2578
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,160
Can we do something else besides the dance deal?

2579
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:24,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

2580
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:26,130
我还穿着它去罗尼家做客了呢

2581
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,000
I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something? A deal is a deal.

2582
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,880
I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.

2583
01:02:26,628 --> 01:02:28,108
很漂亮  我喜欢那件球衣

2584
01:02:28,669 --> 01:02:30,757
- 维罗妮卡不喜欢 - 维罗妮卡可讨厌那件球衣了

2585
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:37,440
Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki.

2586
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:34,116
不管怎样  注意那个限制令  好吗？

2587
01:02:34,695 --> 01:02:37,513
别被蒂芙尼卷进去了

2588
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,160
And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk.

2589
01:02:37,668 --> 01:02:39,382
帕特  你有事瞒着我们  我看得出来

2590
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:43,137
像蒂芙尼  丹尼或是我这样的人没准懂一些

2591
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,080
You can't talk. Only walk.

2592
01:02:43,137 --> 01:02:45,474
你们不懂的事情  想过没有？

2593
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,480
I'm not doing it. Do it. No. That's stupid.

2594
01:02:45,622 --> 01:02:46,833
我们懂一些事情  因为我们更…

2595
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:48,700
我们有第六感  每个人都有

2596
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,920
No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.

2597
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:49,869
不过并不是每个人都会用

2598
01:02:50,411 --> 01:02:52,225
- 天啊  不 - 你好吗  帕特？

2599
01:02:52,379 --> 01:02:55,991
他的第六感大概忘了告诉他  警察来了

2600
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,480
You're not Nikki.

2601
01:02:56,096 --> 01:02:57,541
我要把他带回医院

2602
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,480
Don't look up until you're halfway here.

2603
01:02:57,908 --> 01:02:59,538
不行  他不是通过那玩意了吗？

2604
01:02:59,563 --> 01:03:01,724
先去查查最新法案吧

2605
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,255
我们接到电话

2606
01:03:04,255 --> 01:03:07,680
他们没在你三分之二的刑期上限内

2607
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,522
把你转入精神卫生法许可状态  所以…

2608
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:11,173
慢着  你是老鹰队的球迷吗？

2609
01:03:11,781 --> 01:03:12,501
我是老鹰队球迷

2610
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,240
Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.

2611
01:03:12,851 --> 01:03:15,961
那还有什么关系？ 他哪儿也不会去

2612
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,600
I don't feel anything.

2613
01:03:16,096 --> 01:03:18,004
就让他看完比赛吧  福星很管用呢

2614
01:03:18,075 --> 01:03:19,900
我们要打败海鹰队了  20比17

2615
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,960
Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?

2616
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:23,047
你是怎么啦  就让他留下吧！

2617
01:03:23,852 --> 01:03:25,399
我听不懂你说的“福星”是怎么回事

2618
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:28,987
海鹰要输了  我们要赢了  我很高兴

2619
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,400
We were married for three years and

2620
01:03:29,117 --> 01:03:33,060
可我得带丹尼回巴尔的摩

2621
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,000
five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just

2622
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,120
wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and

2623
01:03:33,204 --> 01:03:34,229
他要为自己的案子辩护

2624
01:03:35,389 --> 01:03:37,962
这不符合精神卫生法  你们错了

2625
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,560
I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted

2626
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:40,765
你们这些人真该替自己害臊

2627
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,400
me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself.

2628
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:52,680
I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after

2629
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:59,000
dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and

2630
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,760
got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he

2631
01:03:59,895 --> 01:04:02,695
我用保险金建的这里  我自己设计的

2632
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,640
stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car

2633
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,089
地板都是硬橡木的  适合舞者弹跳

2634
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:10,440
and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front

2635
01:04:06,669 --> 01:04:07,820
我跳得没那么好  可有关系吗？

2636
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:10,156
这有治疗功效  而且很有意思

2637
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:16,840
seat. That's a feeling.

2638
01:04:11,392 --> 01:04:12,676
墙也很好  我把音乐声开得再大

2639
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,853
- 外面也听不见 - 你在哪睡觉？

2640
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:19,300
楼上  这是个车库  我只是改建了一下

2641
01:04:20,238 --> 01:04:21,499
我想在这搭个芭蕾扶手

2642
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:22,364
你什么时候给她？

2643
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,234
什么？

2644
01:04:26,259 --> 01:04:27,459
给尼基的信

2645
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:31,905
- 今晚吧 - 真的？

2646
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,970
我跟罗尼和维罗妮卡今晚要去看她

2647
01:04:34,479 --> 01:04:36,529
我修改了第一段  引用了莎士比亚

2648
01:04:36,654 --> 01:04:38,174
还承诺…

2649
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:39,236
- 嗯 - 将来要是她想跳舞的话

2650
01:04:39,371 --> 01:04:42,300
我可以陪她跳

2651
01:04:42,438 --> 01:04:43,739
- 因为我已经学过了 - 不错  真不错

2652
01:04:43,874 --> 01:04:45,114
我假定你教得很好了

2653
01:04:45,201 --> 01:04:46,161
我是说  我希望如此

2654
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:47,149
也许你可以同时教我们两个

2655
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:50,514
我还提到了  我为你做的这件事有多慷慨

2656
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:52,362
嗯  确实很慷慨

2657
01:04:52,747 --> 01:04:53,828
任你差遣

2658
01:04:54,114 --> 01:04:54,874
- 是 - 听你所需

2659
01:04:55,012 --> 01:04:58,724
从简单的开始  从那个角落朝我走过来

2660
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:00,409
穿过整个房间

2661
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:03,589
除了跳舞  我能干点别的什么吗？

2662
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,221
开什么玩笑？

2663
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:06,906
我很会使锤子  你有什么要修的吗？

2664
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:07,881
我们说好的

2665
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:12,569
我知道  我只是不想闹笑话而已

2666
01:05:12,569 --> 01:05:17,235
你何不把我当成尼基  朝我走过来

2667
01:05:18,195 --> 01:05:20,676
唯一能表达你对我的思念的

2668
01:05:20,689 --> 01:05:23,180
就是你的步态  你缓慢的步态

2669
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:26,241
你不能说话  只能用步态表达

2670
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,577
我不干  蠢死了

2671
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:30,441
你不走  我就不捎信

2672
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,478
朝我走过来  当我是尼基

2673
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:36,623
来吧  我就是尼基

2674
01:05:36,623 --> 01:05:37,940
你不是尼基

2675
01:05:39,286 --> 01:05:42,286
走到一半再抬头

2676
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:57,673
对了  感觉到没有

2677
01:05:58,024 --> 01:05:59,131
我什么感觉也没有

2678
01:06:02,731 --> 01:06:05,731
你知道汤米是怎么死的吗？

2679
01:06:08,308 --> 01:06:09,158
没有

2680
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:13,827
我们结婚三年零五天

2681
01:06:13,827 --> 01:06:16,213
我很爱他  但最后那几个月

2682
01:06:16,378 --> 01:06:21,560
我毫无性致  感觉我们像是两个世界的人

2683
01:06:21,685 --> 01:06:23,915
我很沮丧  部分原因是我的性格

2684
01:06:23,915 --> 01:06:26,447
另一部分原因是他想要孩子

2685
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:28,397
可我连自己都照顾不好

2686
01:06:28,603 --> 01:06:30,525
我觉得这不是我的错

2687
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,773
不管怎样  一天晚饭后

2688
01:06:38,307 --> 01:06:40,719
他开车去维多利亚的秘密

2689
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:44,937
给我买了几件内衣来帮帮忙

2690
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:48,255
回家路上有个人轮胎没气了

2691
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:51,574
他就停下来帮他  结果被车撞死了

2692
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,446
装着内衣的盒子还放在前座上

2693
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,440
Whoa! Slow down. What?

2694
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:00,866
这就叫感觉

2695
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,600
Your father wanted you to have this.

2696
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,760
He wants me to have- all this Eagles information.

2697
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,960
It's his living. Um, tell Dad thanks.

2698
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,680
Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.

2699
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,360
Football stays out of this place, so does Lord of the Flies. ?

2700
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,480
Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.

2701
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,640
I don't give a fuck. What the hell are you doing? Hey, hey!

2702
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,840
Did you just throw that outside?

2703
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,320
What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all

2704
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,680
about the Lord of the Flies. ?It's a bunch of boys on an island and

2705
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,640
they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch

2706
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,080
has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch,

2707
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,640
then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy,

2708
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,400
and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a

2709
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,400
murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.

2710
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,240
Wow. That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though.

2711
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Who's that? What the... . ? What are you doing here, man?

2712
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,960
If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license,

2713
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,560
then your whole ajudication is thrown out.

2714
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,360
How'd you know we were here?

2715
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,160
I went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me

2716
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,880
you was over here.

2717
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,120
Danny, this is Tiffany. Tiffany, this is Danny.

2718
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,240
Hello. Pat told me about you. So is the girl, that you wrote about?

2719
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,120
Yeah. What? He wrote about me? I'm the girl?

2720
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,240
He wrote about you, all right. What'd he say?

2721
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,320
He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had

2722
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,080
a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but-

2723
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:28,840
Whoa, whoa, that's enough.

2724
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,480
No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.

2725
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you. It was nothing.

2726
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,280
It was just a very general letter.

2727
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:37,120
Cool. She's fine. She is my friend with an F. ?

2728
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,760
A capital F. ? For friend. ?

2729
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,040
Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?

2730
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,400
Yeah. Okay. That's it?

2731
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,920
Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.

2732
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,440
Can I say something? Do you mind? No.

2733
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,880
You sure? Just say it. Say it.

2734
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,680
No, please. I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.

2735
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,120
Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean. You gotta come at

2736
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,600
her with a little bit more soul, man.

2737
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,640
You should move more hips.

2738
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,840
Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And... .

2739
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,400
Okay. Yeah. Can you move em a little bit more? Yeah, that's it.

2740
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,640
Move em a bit more.

2741
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,360
You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that.

2742
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,680
Yeah. You're pretty good. Mm, yeah.

2743
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,800
Okay, we got it, we got it. Okay. Okay.

2744
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,560
Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.

2745
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,640
Black it up? You know damn well what it means.

2746
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:42,960
I got an idea. Come get some, Pat. Come get some.

2747
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:51,456
- 喂！等等 - 怎么？

2748
01:09:51,523 --> 01:09:54,515
你爸让你带着这个

2749
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,840
Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back.

2750
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:58,180
他要我看…全是老鹰队的新闻

2751
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:01,377
- 这是他的事业 - 帮我谢谢爸

2752
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,160
Girl, you gotta move your junk.

2753
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,223
你爸想让你多陪陪他

2754
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,120
I gotta get out of here. I gotta go see this girl, Tanya.

2755
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,160
She lives on this side of town.

2756
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,720
Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.

2757
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,400
Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!

2758
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,120
Bye! Excelsior, Pat!

2759
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,400
Excelsior! That's my man. Lets go!

2760
01:10:11,456 --> 01:10:14,318
橄榄球禁止入内  《蝇王》也不准

2761
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,600
Pat. Patty.

2762
01:10:15,096 --> 01:10:17,573
别这样  你要干什么？ 我还没看完呢

2763
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:20,880
- 关我屁事 - 你搞什么鬼？

2764
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:24,128
你就这么扔外面了？

2765
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,559
怎么了？你在我这不准看那些垃圾

2766
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,503
你听我告诉你

2767
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:30,300
《蝇王》是怎么回事  一个岛上有群小男孩

2768
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:35,819
他们有个海螺  谁拿到海螺谁就能发号施令

2769
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:36,824
要是你拿不到海螺

2770
01:10:36,824 --> 01:10:39,428
你就不能再发号施令了  有个小胖仔

2771
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,960
Where have you been?

2772
01:10:39,428 --> 01:10:41,920
他们管他叫小猪  非常卑鄙  还有场谋杀

2773
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,440
Huh?

2774
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:46,053
人性本恶  哪有什么幸福线

2775
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,040
We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that.

2776
01:10:46,823 --> 01:10:50,095
好强的梗概  可我还是得看

2777
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,840
We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into

2778
01:10:50,262 --> 01:10:55,437
谁  什么  你跑到这来干什么？

2779
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,480
the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs. Do you realize that?

2780
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:59,168
只要你的两个指导医师中有一个丢了执照

2781
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,640
I didn't realize that. Yeah, that's the bind we're in.

2782
01:10:59,778 --> 01:11:01,861
你的整个裁决就算玩完了

2783
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:07,520
I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading

2784
01:11:02,136 --> 01:11:02,719
你怎么知道我们在这的？

2785
01:11:02,868 --> 01:11:04,586
我去你爸妈家找你

2786
01:11:04,722 --> 01:11:05,442
他们说你来这了

2787
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:06,637
丹尼  这是蒂芙尼  蒂芙尼  这是丹尼

2788
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,560
about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good

2789
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,474
你好  帕特跟我说起过你

2790
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:10,498
- 这就是信里说的那姑娘？- 是

2791
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,560
luck thing that you're in.

2792
01:11:10,498 --> 01:11:12,872
他在信里提过我？ 那姑娘是说我？

2793
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,880
Okay. Yeah? Right. Hmm?

2794
01:11:13,128 --> 01:11:15,119
- 没错  他提过你 - 他怎么说的？

2795
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,400
他说你们俩在互相帮助  你人很好

2796
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:23,269
还说你口无遮拦  不过…

2797
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:25,769
接着说嘛  他信里还说我什么了

2798
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,371
你想知道什么的话  我可以直接告诉你

2799
01:11:27,543 --> 01:11:28,680
没什么  那只是封很普通的信

2800
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:32,685
- 不错嘛  她挺好的 - 她就是我那个f打头的朋友

2801
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:39,160
I just wanted to, maybe I didn't, spend enough time with you growing

2802
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,437
- 是大写的F - 指的是“朋友”

2803
01:11:35,586 --> 01:11:38,874
我能看看你们俩练的舞吗？

2804
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:44,760
up. I spent too much time with your brother. It might have made you

2805
01:11:39,186 --> 01:11:42,389
没问题

2806
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,080
feel worse about your behavior, but I didn't know anything, I didn't

2807
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,080
know how to handle it.

2808
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:50,233
- 就这样？ - 怎么？有什么问题

2809
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,160
I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff

2810
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:51,959
- 介意我提点意见吗？ - 你说

2811
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:03,000
is about. It's about us, spending time now. I wanna do everything I

2812
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,293
- 确定？ - 说吧  说吧

2813
01:11:53,468 --> 01:11:56,245
- 你说吧 - 帕特  我觉得你应该面对蒂芙尼

2814
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:59,814
我跳给你看  我给你演示一下

2815
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:01,449
你应该对她表现得更有感情

2816
01:12:01,477 --> 01:12:02,517
你应该多摆胯

2817
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,200
can to help you get back on your feet. That's the whole point. Yeah.

2818
01:12:02,574 --> 01:12:04,855
就像这个样子  帕特  像这样开始

2819
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,171
你扭动的幅度可以更大些吗？

2820
01:12:07,184 --> 01:12:09,504
没错  就这样

2821
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,778
幅度再大些

2822
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,240
I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things.

2823
01:12:10,957 --> 01:12:14,644
你还可以转个圈  这样没问题的

2824
01:12:15,104 --> 01:12:17,073
很好  你跳得很不错

2825
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:25,720
So would you, would you just come downstairs

2826
01:12:19,884 --> 01:12:22,432
- 好了  我们懂了 - 好吧

2827
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,520
and talk to me and Randy now?

2828
01:12:25,464 --> 01:12:28,047
来吧  帕特  再投入点

2829
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,240
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

2830
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,654
帕特  把脸涂黑

2831
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,040
He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything.

2832
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,734
- 什么意思？ - 你懂的

2833
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,520
All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game.

2834
01:12:34,903 --> 01:12:37,644
等等  等等

2835
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,400
Tell him why. Because he believes in you. Is that true?

2836
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:38,578
我有办法了

2837
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,520
I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you. I want you to know that.

2838
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,782
来试试  帕特  来试试

2839
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,960
So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

2840
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,280
You understand? Yeah.

2841
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,400
Heavy. I want you to go to the game with your brother.

2842
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,640
You want me to go to the game with Jake?

2843
01:12:55,644 --> 01:12:57,854
曳步  曳步

2844
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,520
Of course I do. Does he want me to go?

2845
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,860
妹子  动作大点

2846
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,960
Of course he wants you to go.

2847
01:13:02,237 --> 01:13:04,002
我得走了  要去见个叫塔尼娅的姑娘

2848
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,080
He told you that? He told me, yes.

2849
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,640
Even with all his friends? With all his friends. He trusts you.

2850
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:05,060
她住附近

2851
01:13:05,235 --> 01:13:06,705
去见塔尼娅吧

2852
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,600
He's not embarrassed?

2853
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,456
我会去看的  你们一定要赢啊！

2854
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,440
No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned

2855
01:13:08,781 --> 01:13:10,251
再见  精进不休啊  帕特！

2856
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,840
from the stadium. Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take

2857
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:12,637
- 精进不休！ - 这就对了  走了！

2858
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,200
a lot of money from this asshole.

2859
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,100
帕特  帕特

2860
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,920
Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact,

2861
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,440
I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.

2862
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,600
Randy.  I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a

2863
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,640
family business, it's our family endeavor. We all stick together on this.

2864
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,520
That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe.

2865
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,080
I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very

2866
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,423
你去哪了？

2867
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,480
important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and

2868
01:13:43,448 --> 01:13:43,948
嗯？

2869
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:47,456
现在局势很不妙

2870
01:13:49,462 --> 01:13:53,770
我们得打赢巨人队才有机会出线

2871
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,080
it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's,

2872
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,280
it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.

2873
01:13:53,945 --> 01:13:58,580
才有机会打入季后赛  你想到没有？

2874
01:13:59,120 --> 01:13:59,880
What is this thing you're doing?

2875
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:02,910
- 没想到 - 我们赌的就是这个

2876
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,400
Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon?

2877
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,680
It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

2878
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:09,040
我觉得我们父子应该多花点时间待在一起

2879
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:11,975
一起读老鹰队的新闻  一起讨论

2880
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:14,479
来增强你身上福气的力量

2881
01:14:16,175 --> 01:14:17,460
好吧

2882
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,360
Listen, I need to ask you something.

2883
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,560
Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?

2884
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,960
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.

2885
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:32,200
Why? These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have

2886
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,280
prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet.

2887
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,040
And we don't have a move yet.

2888
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,480
I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I

2889
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,400
wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from

2890
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:42,040
我只是想…你小时候我没有多花时间陪你

2891
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,720
the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because

2892
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:45,038
我花了太多时间陪你哥

2893
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,640
I'm spending time with you.

2894
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,640
Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

2895
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,600
No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because

2896
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:49,703
这可能让你变得不够自信

2897
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,760
I'm not with him during the games.

2898
01:14:49,703 --> 01:14:51,339
我那时什么都不知道

2899
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,880
Guess what? What?

2900
01:14:51,524 --> 01:14:53,430
我不知道该怎么处理

2901
01:14:54,040 --> 01:15:02,680
Nikki replied to your letter. But you can't read it until after

2902
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:56,648
老鹰队的意义就在这里

2903
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:01,300
是为了让我们能花更多时间相处

2904
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,480
you nail the big move. Go.

2905
01:15:06,629 --> 01:15:11,288
我想尽我所能帮你康复  这才是全部意义

2906
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,359
我希望你能跟我一起看这些比赛

2907
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:22,458
这样我们就能一起聊天  彼此谅解

2908
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,360
Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading

2909
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,280
Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head.

2910
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,640
We don't almost have it, all right?

2911
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,680
I just hope you can handle it. Thank you.

2912
01:15:29,802 --> 01:15:31,332
你能不能下楼来

2913
01:15:31,332 --> 01:15:32,487
跟我和兰迪聊聊天？

2914
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,720
What was her energy when she gave it to you?

2915
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:35,906
兰迪  跟他说说我在干什么

2916
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,240
She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.

2917
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:40,215
他把所有财产都赌在了跟巨人队的那场比赛上

2918
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,040
She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?

2919
01:15:40,215 --> 01:15:44,234
他用来开餐馆的所有钱都赌在了那场比赛上

2920
01:15:44,317 --> 01:15:44,836
告诉他为什么

2921
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:49,047
- 因为他相信你 - 真的吗？

2922
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,360
Try to stay positive.

2923
01:15:49,987 --> 01:15:54,357
我相信你  帕特  我想让你明白这一点

2924
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,800
I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything

2925
01:15:55,212 --> 01:15:56,901
所以我这次赌得很大

2926
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,080
that's, you know, is that too much to ask?

2927
01:15:58,481 --> 01:15:59,321
- 懂吗？ - 懂

2928
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,200
No.

2929
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:02,587
赌得很大  我想让你跟你哥一起去看比赛

2930
01:16:03,252 --> 01:16:04,927
你想让我跟杰克一起去看比赛？

2931
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,120
I thought you were gonna read it out loud.

2932
01:16:05,582 --> 01:16:07,102
- 当然 - 他想让我去吗？

2933
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:08,427
他当然想让你去

2934
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,360
Okay. Sorry.

2935
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:10,591
- 他这么跟你说的？ - 他说的

2936
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,440
"Dear Pat,

2937
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:14,327
- 他的朋友们也去？ - 他们都去  他信任你

2938
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,680
It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm

2939
01:16:14,525 --> 01:16:15,365
他不觉得难为情？

2940
01:16:15,477 --> 01:16:19,767
不  我也想去的 不过你知道我被禁止入场了

2941
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,680
sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly

2942
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,200
getting it to me through Tiffany.

2943
01:16:19,767 --> 01:16:21,803
我想亲眼看见我们打败巨人队

2944
01:16:21,938 --> 01:16:23,259
然后从这个混球手里赢一大笔钱

2945
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,400
This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe.

2946
01:16:24,945 --> 01:16:27,068
要我说  这个赌实在是太蠢了

2947
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:29,214
事实上

2948
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,280
I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are

2949
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,885
把开餐厅的所有钱都赌上去简直不可理喻

2950
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,680
feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I

2951
01:16:33,713 --> 01:16:37,194
兰迪  我希望你听懂我的话了

2952
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,960
always knew you were.

2953
01:16:37,365 --> 01:16:42,477
这就像是笔家庭生意

2954
01:16:39,316 --> 01:16:43,561
我们全家人一起努力  一起坚持下去

2955
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:47,496
就是这样  这就是一种积极的力量

2956
01:16:49,575 --> 01:16:52,305
我答应了蒂芙尼完成一项任务

2957
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,720
I was moved to read about Excelsior' and your

2958
01:16:52,499 --> 01:16:55,847
我们星期天有个很重要的环节要完成

2959
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,520
belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read

2960
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,840
the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so

2961
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,840
negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that

2962
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:02,144
这对我很有好处  爸

2963
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,520
reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare

2964
01:17:02,144 --> 01:17:04,068
这让我变得更有条理  更专注

2965
01:17:04,068 --> 01:17:07,121
我以前从没这么想过  但这是件好事

2966
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,840
themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these

2967
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,520
positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the

2968
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:09,277
究竟是什么事？

2969
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:12,463
什么事  是什么任务？

2970
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,400
signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our

2971
01:17:13,176 --> 01:17:17,937
是跳舞  只是单纯的跳舞  我发誓没别的

2972
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,960
marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be

2973
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,880
better off moving on with our lives separately.

2974
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:30,920
Please don't react quickly

2975
01:17:30,007 --> 01:17:32,207
我有件事要问你

2976
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,960
to this, but take time to think about it.

2977
01:17:32,372 --> 01:17:35,486
明天我能不能半天陪你  半天看老鹰队的比赛？

2978
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,000
I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki. ?

2979
01:17:35,486 --> 01:17:37,032
我就当你没问过

2980
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:42,482
- 为什么？ - 你答应过我这两天

2981
01:17:42,642 --> 01:17:45,879
要练习那个那个绝招的  我们还没练好

2982
01:17:45,879 --> 01:17:46,470
我们还没想好是什么动作呢

2983
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:49,027
我知道  但我爸对我敞开了心扉  我很感动

2984
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,040
I think I'm done for today, okay?

2985
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:54,043
我想为他做点什么 他担心老鹰队的好运被破坏了

2986
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,360
She said to show her something,

2987
01:17:54,043 --> 01:17:54,502
他觉得这是因为

2988
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:55,456
我跟你待在一起

2989
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:57,534
那是我坏了老鹰队的好运喽？

2990
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,880
Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never

2991
01:17:58,009 --> 01:18:00,730
不是你坏了好运  是我没跟他一起看比赛

2992
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,600
done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds

2993
01:18:00,794 --> 01:18:02,155
好运才没了

2994
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,560
of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration,

2995
01:18:03,503 --> 01:18:05,071
- 你猜怎么着？ - 怎么？

2996
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:07,441
尼基回信了

2997
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:15,280
discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.

2998
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:16,132
但是没搞定那个绝招就不准看信  开始吧

2999
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,640
Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

3000
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,560
Can I use your phone? Is it an emergency?

3001
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Yeah, kind of. What kind of emergency?

3002
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:37,897
蒂芙尼  对不起  不看信我什么也做不好

3003
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,906
这事在我脑子里  一直挥之不去

3004
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,160
Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell

3005
01:18:40,286 --> 01:18:41,686
要不然我们什么也弄不出来

3006
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,200
her I'm not gonna be on time.

3007
01:18:43,516 --> 01:18:45,556
- 但愿你能接受 - 谢谢

3008
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,360
Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know?

3009
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:50,440
She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you

3010
01:18:47,482 --> 01:18:49,242
她给你的时候心情怎么样？

3011
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,200
can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know,

3012
01:18:50,411 --> 01:18:53,434
她很好奇  很兴奋  还有点害怕

3013
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,800
for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?

3014
01:18:54,826 --> 01:18:57,401
害怕什么  她告诉你没有？

3015
01:18:59,080 --> 01:18:59,960
That a bad thing?

3016
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,440
No, I think, it's a good thing.

3017
01:19:01,266 --> 01:19:02,939
别太失望

3018
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,040
Don't drink too much. Don't hit anybody. You'll be fine.

3019
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,480
Yeah. I'm solid.

3020
01:19:07,094 --> 01:19:10,695
我大声读出来可以吗？ 要是她写了什么

3021
01:19:10,975 --> 01:19:13,070
你懂的  这要求过分吗？

3022
01:19:13,406 --> 01:19:14,226
没有

3023
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:15,920
This is my little brother Pat.

3024
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:16,960
Hey, how you doing?

3025
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,240
So, Pat, what's this I hear about you just gettin' out?

3026
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,720
Yeah, from the looney bin!

3027
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,000
What the fuck?! I talked to you about that already!

3028
01:19:21,226 --> 01:19:23,548
你不是要大声读出来吗

3029
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:24,811
好吧  抱歉

3030
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,720
I told you guys- It's all right.

3031
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,059
亲爱的帕特

3032
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,680
Huh? No. It's alright.

3033
01:19:29,459 --> 01:19:32,448
收到你的来信我十分感动

3034
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,200
He's a good dude! He's a good dude.

3035
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,240
Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!

3036
01:19:32,624 --> 01:19:35,586
但我很高兴你甘愿冒险

3037
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:37,188
让蒂芙尼把信捎给我

3038
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,280
They're here every week! No!

3039
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:41,027
这既让我们有机会交流

3040
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,839
又没有违反你的人身限制令  让我很安心

3041
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,673
我必须承认你听起来很好

3042
01:19:48,673 --> 01:19:50,475
我很高兴你如此乐观

3043
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:51,480
Uh, Jake you better get your brother.

3044
01:19:50,475 --> 01:19:52,256
变得更加体贴  更有同情心

3045
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,640
Cuckoo bird's takin' off. Doctor Patel!

3046
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,666
我一直都清楚  这才是你的本色

3047
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,840
Pat! Hey! What are you doing here?

3048
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,640
You know, we must beat the Giants, my brother.

3049
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:02,720
I'm not supposed to be seeing you,

3050
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,120
right? Outside the office?

3051
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,800
Pat, Pat. That's illegal!

3052
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,280
Pat, today I'm your brother in green, not your therapist. I'm so

3053
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,720
happy to see you. How wonderful that you are here!

3054
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:12,148
你所说的“精进不休”

3055
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,520
Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff.

3056
01:20:12,246 --> 01:20:14,269
还有你对美满结局的信念让我很感动

3057
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,240
Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin'

3058
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:15,812
你读了我在高中教的那些书

3059
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,880
Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the

3060
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:16,843
这个举动太有爱了  我也很感动

3061
01:20:16,843 --> 01:20:17,476
很遗憾你觉得它们写得太悲观

3062
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,520
receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage.

3063
01:20:17,636 --> 01:20:19,571
但我不同意  我觉得它们都是伟大的艺术作品

3064
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,720
You can say that again. Those cocksuckers!

3065
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:21,398
反映了人生的艰辛

3066
01:20:21,398 --> 01:20:25,807
能帮助孩子们为未来的人生做好准备

3067
01:20:25,967 --> 01:20:27,838
尽管有这些好的进展  帕特

3068
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:29,934
我不得不说  如果换做是我

3069
01:20:29,934 --> 01:20:32,665
我需要确定你已经做好准备和我破镜重圆

3070
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,200
否则的话  我觉得

3071
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:40,450
我们还是分开旅行的好

3072
01:20:48,046 --> 01:20:50,520
请不要草率回信

3073
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,880
Okay, you know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if

3074
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,046
好好考虑一阵子

3075
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,880
you really want, you can call Veronica cause she does, but I

3076
01:20:53,123 --> 01:20:55,191
很高兴你过得不错  爱你的  尼基

3077
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,120
don't want to talk to Veronica.

3078
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,080
Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?

3079
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,400
Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down.

3080
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,800
You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away.

3081
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,720
There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.

3082
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,600
You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the

3083
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:08,920
line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor.

3084
01:21:07,684 --> 01:21:09,005
今天就到这  行吗？

3085
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,720
You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.

3086
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,600
Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be

3087
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,720
able to say what I wanna say.

3088
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,499
她说要你证明给她看

3089
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,560
You're right, man. You're right, you're right,

3090
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:24,520
Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go! What the fuck? What's that smell?

3091
01:21:18,893 --> 01:21:20,421
这个舞就是个机会

3092
01:21:20,421 --> 01:21:22,041
你以前根本就不可能做到

3093
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,054
这能表现你的

3094
01:21:23,054 --> 01:21:28,423
注意力  协作能力和条理性

3095
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,560
Nasty Indian curry! This is America, baby! Go back to your country!

3096
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,160
What, what's wrong? Hey!

3097
01:21:31,385 --> 01:21:36,785
很浪漫  就像我说过的那样  是为她而做的

3098
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,680
Whoa, whoa, what's going on? Stay back, Pat. Stay back.

3099
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,960
Leave the fucking Indians alone. Stay here, stay here!

3100
01:21:38,921 --> 01:21:41,676
谢谢你帮我捎信  明天见

3101
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,560
I'm not gonna go anywhere. Don't get in a fight!

3102
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,480
I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight.

3103
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,120
Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!

3104
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,840
Break it up or you'll be arrested!

3105
01:21:55,186 --> 01:21:57,236
- 手机借我一下行吗？ - 要紧事？

3106
01:21:57,601 --> 01:21:59,701
- 算是吧 - 什么事？

3107
01:22:01,572 --> 01:22:04,213
我答应了蒂芙尼要跟她练舞

3108
01:22:04,282 --> 01:22:05,442
得告诉她我要迟点去

3109
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:08,504
别拿那个疯姑娘当回事

3110
01:22:08,873 --> 01:22:12,346
她不是疯子…我借杰克的手机好了

3111
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:14,300
你不能进场真是太遗憾了

3112
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,358
但我知道你是因为打架才被赶出来的

3113
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,560
What'd you do? What happened? Dad-

3114
01:22:18,102 --> 01:22:20,254
看来我们也没什么两样  对吧？

3115
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,840
What the fuck happened? Dad.

3116
01:22:21,807 --> 01:22:22,704
这算是坏事吗？

3117
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,280
The birds lose, I lose a fuckin' fortune, a fortune to Randy!

3118
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,310
不  我倒觉得是件好事

3119
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,120
What the fuck did you do?! You fucking lost it!

3120
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:29,035
别喝太多酒  别跟人打架  就不会有事了

3121
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,520
I thought you said you had it together! You were solid!

3122
01:22:29,415 --> 01:22:30,567
我清醒得很

3123
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,440
I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad.

3124
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:35,720
I'm solid, I'm solid now.

3125
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,880
You fell apart! What are you fucking talking about?!

3126
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:38,680
Your son was trying to-

3127
01:22:38,428 --> 01:22:39,628
这是帕特  我弟

3128
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,080
It's all fucking ruined now. It's all ruined.

3129
01:22:39,845 --> 01:22:40,446
你好吗？

3130
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,680
No, Dad! It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined!

3131
01:22:40,596 --> 01:22:42,805
帕特  我听说你刚被放出来啊？

3132
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,160
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!

3133
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:45,420
刚从疯人院出来呢！

3134
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,160
It's all ruined, you little fucking shit!

3135
01:22:45,981 --> 01:22:48,820
搞什么鬼？我都说了别提这个

3136
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,440
No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad!

3137
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,600
You loser! You loser!

3138
01:22:49,266 --> 01:22:51,680
- 我说了… - 没关系

3139
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,640
I'm not a loser.

3140
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,200
You fucking loser! You ruined everything!

3141
01:22:52,345 --> 01:22:53,683
没关系

3142
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:55,800
He was defending his brother!

3143
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,100
好兄弟！

3144
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,720
You fucking idiot! You spike the ball on the one yard line,

3145
01:22:56,895 --> 01:23:00,525
该死！黄祸来了！

3146
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,280
Who is this?! Who's this?!

3147
01:23:01,569 --> 01:23:03,720
- 他们每个礼拜都来！ - 不是吧

3148
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,360
We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to

3149
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,840
somebody, it is not cool to not show up!

3150
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,360
Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening,

3151
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,840
I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany, I-

3152
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,560
Oh, really? Yes.

3153
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,160
I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my

3154
01:23:16,095 --> 01:23:16,418
杰克  看好你弟

3155
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,360
dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie-

3156
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:19,730
- 布谷鸟要起飞了 - 帕特尔医生！

3157
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,840
Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but

3158
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,360
all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help.

3159
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:25,143
- 帕特！ - 你怎么也来了？

3160
01:23:25,588 --> 01:23:27,389
我们必须得击败巨人队嘛

3161
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,000
I'm Tiffany, by the way.

3162
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,801
我是不是不该…

3163
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:30,002
在办公室外面跟你见面的？

3164
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,355
- 帕特  帕特 - 这是违法的

3165
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,240
What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?

3166
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,655
帕特  今天我就是你的同盟军

3167
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,520
There's no craziness. I told you who she was,

3168
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:34,647
不是你的心理医生

3169
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,560
I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation!

3170
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:37,552
真高兴见到你  你来了真是太好了！

3171
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,240
She's fucking nuts! When you started spending time with her,

3172
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:39,927
杰克  这是克里夫  我的医生克里夫

3173
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,760
it all fell apart. This is the fucking reason right here.

3174
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:42,231
注意两件事  一件是那帮草包后卫的部署

3175
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,040
You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?

3176
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:44,997
另一件  在比赛开始至死球期间

3177
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,680
Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since-

3178
01:23:45,137 --> 01:23:47,035
我们就得把他们的接球手打得屁股开花

3179
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,000
You think that I'm why today's happened?

3180
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,015
再说一遍吧  那帮狗杂种！

3181
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,600
That's right, you are why today happened.

3182
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,840
I'm the reason why today happened?

3183
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,320
I think so. Let's talk about that.

3184
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,600
Be my guest.

3185
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,760
The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the

3186
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,280
Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got

3187
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,200
together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to

3188
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,160
five in the NLCS.

3189
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,440
She's right, Dad.

3190
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,160
The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-

3191
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,160
seven to fourteen.

3192
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:11,920
Wow.

3193
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,920
The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and

3194
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,960
the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World

3195
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,000
Series, ten to two.

3196
01:24:18,143 --> 01:24:20,465
我没有她的号码

3197
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:19,840
Oh, wow.

3198
01:24:20,651 --> 01:24:23,588
你要是真想找她的话  可以打给维罗妮卡

3199
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,320
Let me think about that. Wait a minute.

3200
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,080
Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks,

3201
01:24:23,738 --> 01:24:24,978
但我不想跟维罗妮卡说话

3202
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,040
fourteen to seven.

3203
01:24:25,025 --> 01:24:25,855
你为什么不跟维罗妮卡说话？

3204
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,640
He was with you? He was with me. We went for a run.

3205
01:24:25,985 --> 01:24:28,310
因为她让我觉得心烦！ 她只会让我心烦

3206
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:29,880
Really? That's crazy.

3207
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:29,746
你不能再这样了  不能对婚姻置之不理

3208
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,400
There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every

3209
01:24:29,895 --> 01:24:31,765
你们之间明明是有爱意的  我以前看的出来

3210
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,920
day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he

3211
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,760
你们的感情明明很好  只是不知哪里出了问题

3212
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,240
wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the

3213
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,115
你得把它修复好  就像个按摩师一样

3214
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,040
把其中错位的地方矫正好

3215
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,760
Eagles beat the New York Giants.

3216
01:24:38,805 --> 01:24:42,055
别再顾着面子了！ 我可不想去你家的时候

3217
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,280
She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts.

3218
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:43,330
想说什么都不敢说出口

3219
01:24:43,857 --> 01:24:45,698
你说得没错  你说得没错

3220
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,400
Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the

3221
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:49,285
老鹰队必胜！我们上吧！ 搞什么鬼？

3222
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,560
state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York?

3223
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:52,386
什么鬼气味？

3224
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,360
Huh? Anybody? Do you? Do you know?

3225
01:24:53,257 --> 01:24:55,801
臭烘烘的印度咖喱味  这儿是美国！

3226
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:59,960
Excelsior. ?Look it up. Yeah, Excelsior. ?Oh Pat.

3227
01:24:55,801 --> 01:24:57,770
滚回你们自己国家去！

3228
01:24:58,569 --> 01:25:00,376
怎么了？

3229
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,880
Not that I give a fuck about football or about your

3230
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:05,070
- 怎么回事？ - 别过来  帕特  别过来

3231
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,840
superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the

3232
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,200
Eagles guy whose personal motto is Excelsior, ?to a fucking Giants

3233
01:25:07,115 --> 01:25:09,555
- 别管那些该死的印度佬 - 呆在这  呆在这！

3234
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,400
game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.

3235
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,270
- 我哪都不去 - 别打架！

3236
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,920
Unbelievable. Wow. How did you know all that stuff?

3237
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:16,332
我不要打架  我不要打架

3238
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:24,000
I did my research. Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.

3239
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,212
别碰我哥！

3240
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,000
Thank you.

3241
01:25:25,315 --> 01:25:28,175
快停手  不然你们就要被捕了！

3242
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,800
I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before,

3243
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,200
but I gotta say, now I do.

3244
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,240
Oh, now you like her, Dad? I have to say I do. Yup.

3245
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:42,840
Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot

3246
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,640
of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.

3247
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,640
Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been

3248
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:52,916
- 你怎么了？发生什么事了？ - 爸

3249
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,160
betting against my father for years.

3250
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,240
Is that right?

3251
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,080
You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!

3252
01:25:53,331 --> 01:25:54,412
- 这他妈怎么回事？ - 爸

3253
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,840
That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!

3254
01:25:54,438 --> 01:25:57,846
老鹰输了  我输了一大笔钱给兰迪！

3255
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,840
You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it.

3256
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,120
Yeah, prove it, prove it!

3257
01:25:58,256 --> 01:26:00,820
你他妈搞什么鬼？！全搞砸了！

3258
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,040
How do you want me to prove it? How's he gonna prove it?

3259
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,560
By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.

3260
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:03,295
你不是说你很镇定吗！你走的时候还很清醒！

3261
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,320
我很清醒  比赛的时候我很清醒

3262
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3263
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:06,650
现在也很清醒

3264
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,840
Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying?

3265
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,910
你明明就没控制住！还讲什么鬼话？！

3266
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:09,720
他尽力了…

3267
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,248
现在全完了  全完了

3268
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,945
- 爸  别这样！ - 全完了！

3269
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:17,520
Against the Cowboys.

3270
01:26:15,415 --> 01:26:16,495
爸  爸  别这样！

3271
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,760
That's your team isn't it, Randy? That's his team!

3272
01:26:16,655 --> 01:26:18,564
全完了  都怪你这个混蛋！

3273
01:26:18,703 --> 01:26:19,890
爸！我没做错什么！搞清楚！

3274
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:22,152
你个废物！

3275
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,520
I know who his team is. When is the game?

3276
01:26:22,313 --> 01:26:24,290
我不是废物

3277
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,920
December twenty-eight, last game of the season.

3278
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:26,930
你个废物！你把什么都搞砸了！

3279
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,000
Oh, my God. Same day as the Benjamin Franklin

3280
01:26:27,095 --> 01:26:27,595
他是为了救他哥哥！

3281
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:31,679
你个白痴！居然在一码线上掷地球

3282
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,360
Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.

3283
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,400
Oh God. Randy, I thought they were America's Team.

3284
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,388
- 是谁？ - 是谁？

3285
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,560
Don't you believe in America's Team?

3286
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:38,678
我们得谈谈  你一本正经地做了保证

3287
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,240
Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?

3288
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,640
Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your

3289
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,361
结果却放我鸽子  实在太逊了！

3290
01:26:40,677 --> 01:26:42,918
- 听我说  我本来是想打电话给你 - 怎么回事？

3291
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,600
book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.

3292
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:45,335
我真准备打给你的  蒂芙尼…

3293
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,800
I like it. No. No, Patrizio-

3294
01:26:46,475 --> 01:26:47,145
- 真的吗？ - 真的

3295
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:48,825
我跟你说过了  我要分一半时间给我爸

3296
01:26:48,965 --> 01:26:51,106
我爸拉着我这一边  帕特尔医生  罗尼…

3297
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,520
I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son,

3298
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:54,740
这借口不错  全是他们的错

3299
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,880
I'll take the action. I'll take it.

3300
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,480
Dad! Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

3301
01:26:54,875 --> 01:27:00,164
但他们可没承诺要报答我

3302
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,040
I have faith, I have faith. Excelsior belongs in this house-

3303
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,840
Dad- --not in the State of New York. In this house.

3304
01:27:00,985 --> 01:27:02,185
对了  我叫蒂芙尼

3305
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,200
Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that Excelsior?was the state

3306
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,040
motto of New York, okay?

3307
01:27:05,425 --> 01:27:07,645
这个蒂芙尼・麦克斯维尔到底有什么毛病？

3308
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,120
I didn't know, either, but now I know.

3309
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,440
I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is

3310
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,840
toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing-

3311
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:09,000
她没有毛病  我告诉过你了

3312
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,120
Randy, what do you say--

3313
01:27:09,245 --> 01:27:11,104
这是我跟她之间的问题  我们在商量呢！

3314
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,480
Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough. Randy, what do you say?

3315
01:27:11,256 --> 01:27:12,855
她就是个疯子！自从你跟她待在一起后

3316
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,240
My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points.

3317
01:27:13,005 --> 01:27:15,520
问题就层出不穷  这全是她的错

3318
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,040
I 'll give you three more.

3319
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:17,877
你觉得是我坏了老鹰队的好运  是吧？

3320
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,520
Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet!

3321
01:27:18,254 --> 01:27:20,641
自从他碰到你之后…

3322
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,040
In fact, I'll give you ten points. No, Dad! Dad!

3323
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:23,050
你觉得今天的事都是我造成的？

3324
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:29,920
Dad! You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.

3325
01:27:23,414 --> 01:27:24,726
没错  都是你造成的

3326
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:26,231
我就是那个祸根？

3327
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:27,701
- 没错 - 我们谈谈吧

3328
01:27:27,795 --> 01:27:28,888
洗耳恭听

3329
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,320
Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus!

3330
01:27:29,509 --> 01:27:31,907
我跟帕特第一次在我姐姐家见面的那天晚上

3331
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,720
How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give

3332
01:27:31,907 --> 01:27:35,855
老鹰队轻松击败了49人队  40比26

3333
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,600
you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are

3334
01:27:35,983 --> 01:27:37,495
第二次  我们一起跑步

3335
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:41,000
cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten.

3336
01:27:37,495 --> 01:27:39,890
老鹰队在国联冠军赛上以7比5击败了道奇队

3337
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,160
Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the

3338
01:27:40,684 --> 01:27:41,365
爸  她说得没错

3339
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,095
我们下一次跑步的时候  老鹰队击败了隼鹰队

3340
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,560
dance thing. What's that? Tiffany, what's that?

3341
01:27:45,305 --> 01:27:46,170
27比14

3342
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,160
What? No, no, no, no. You're crazy to give away that many

3343
01:27:47,191 --> 01:27:50,095
第三次  我们晚餐去吃了提子麦麸

3344
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,280
points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that!

3345
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:56,360
However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.

3346
01:27:50,225 --> 01:27:53,234
老鹰队在第四场世界联赛上10比2

3347
01:27:53,364 --> 01:27:54,337
大胜坦帕湾

3348
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,920
What? No parlay! No! No, don't do it. Don't do it.

3349
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:57,800
慢着  让我想想

3350
01:27:58,207 --> 01:28:00,653
你怎么不想想  老鹰队14比7

3351
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,657
击败海鹰队的时候

3352
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,360
Pat, how do they run this dance competition?

3353
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:04,393
- 他跟你在一起？ - 他跟我在一起  我们去跑步了

3354
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,360
I mean, how do they score it and everything?

3355
01:28:04,915 --> 01:28:05,755
真的吗？太神了

3356
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,800
I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating.

3357
01:28:05,802 --> 01:28:08,309
我跟帕特排练以来一直都没有比赛

3358
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,960
We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high-

3359
01:28:08,434 --> 01:28:11,960
要是今天帕特像他答应的那样跟我在一起的话

3360
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,280
end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay,

3361
01:28:12,095 --> 01:28:14,410
他就不会打架  不会惹麻烦

3362
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,800
Randy. Don't- They go by the Philadelphia rules.

3363
01:28:14,566 --> 01:28:15,970
没准老鹰队还会击败纽约巨人队

3364
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,480
Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest.

3365
01:28:18,265 --> 01:28:20,825
爸  她说得很有道理  所有比分都是对的

3366
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,800
You have to average the four judges' scores.

3367
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:26,120
Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?

3368
01:28:23,085 --> 01:28:26,017
有人知道纽约州纪念邮戳上印的

3369
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,880
We suck. We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,

3370
01:28:26,137 --> 01:28:28,778
纽约州官方格言是什么吗？

3371
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,080
I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.

3372
01:28:28,957 --> 01:28:32,227
有人知道吗  你知道吗  你呢？

3373
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,040
And how are the people you're competing against?

3374
01:28:32,252 --> 01:28:37,060
- “精进不休” 不信的话自己去查 - 帕特

3375
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,120
They're good. Some of them are professionals.

3376
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,120
They're good? Better than you? A lot better.

3377
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,320
A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five,

3378
01:28:38,123 --> 01:28:41,145
我才不在乎橄榄球  还有你们那些迷信

3379
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,040
I would be really very generous, right?

3380
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:44,209
但如果换做是我  我绝不会让一个

3381
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,120
No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away-

3382
01:28:44,344 --> 01:28:48,778
拿“精进不休”当座右铭的球迷去看巨人队比赛

3383
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,400
Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten!

3384
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,680
Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!

3385
01:28:49,015 --> 01:28:52,087
更何况他还背着官司

3386
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,880
We can't get five! Give em a five. Give em a five.

3387
01:28:52,805 --> 01:28:55,760
- 不可思议 - 你怎么会知道这些东西？

3388
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:53,840
We can do a five.

3389
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,080
What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance!

3390
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,960
That's the parlay.

3391
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:02,115
- 我做了很多功课 - 不得不说  这很有说服力

3392
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,400
Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?

3393
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,280
You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to

3394
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:05,240
win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta

3395
01:29:02,539 --> 01:29:03,166
谢谢

3396
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,840
get at least a five at the dance.

3397
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:09,176
我得把整件事重新想一下  我以前还不信这一套

3398
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,280
That's very, very manic indeed. That's the parlay. Shake on it.

3399
01:29:09,401 --> 01:29:10,661
但现在信了

3400
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:16,200
You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this.  Randy,

3401
01:29:11,807 --> 01:29:15,910
- 那你现在喜欢她了吧？ - 不得不说  是的

3402
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,720
Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

3403
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:21,771
帕吉欧  我很内疚  是你设的赌局

3404
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,480
Pat, you can't quit. I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

3405
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,240
Pat, calm down. Thank about it. See you later.

3406
01:29:21,985 --> 01:29:24,684
我赢了一大笔钱  可你家现在却闹得一团糟

3407
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,720
Pat, no. What are you doing?

3408
01:29:25,296 --> 01:29:28,030
滚你的  兰迪  你明明就开心死了

3409
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,120
Pat. I'm out.

3410
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,404
巴不得发生这种破事呢

3411
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:33,680
Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from

3412
01:29:29,404 --> 01:29:30,430
你跟我爸打赌打了好几年了

3413
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:31,536
真的吗？

3414
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:33,480
你现在说这些狗屁  你爽死了好么！

3415
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,440
the jaws of victory. There you go.

3416
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:35,300
一派胡言！不是这样的！别胡说！

3417
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,720
What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that

3418
01:29:35,451 --> 01:29:36,341
你就是爽死了！不然的话  你证明一下啊

3419
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,680
connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter

3420
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,675
没错  证明一下

3421
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:40,734
- 你要我怎么证明？ - 他要怎么证明？

3422
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,640
anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...

3423
01:29:40,892 --> 01:29:45,389
再赌一次  给他们一个机会赢回一切

3424
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,080
I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

3425
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,360
You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the

3426
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,240
signs... if it's me reading the signs-

3427
01:29:45,389 --> 01:29:46,050
要么加倍  要么勾销

3428
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:46,960
不行  不行

3429
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,920
If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.

3430
01:29:47,205 --> 01:29:48,570
赌下个礼拜跟孟加拉虎队的比赛

3431
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:49,764
要么加倍  要么勾销

3432
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:50,488
你指的是这个吗？

3433
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,760
Pat! You are not a stand up guy!

3434
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,021
是跟牛仔队打

3435
01:29:58,055 --> 01:30:02,315
- 那不是你支持的队吗  兰迪？ - 那是他的队！

3436
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,120
Pat! I told you not to push it.

3437
01:30:02,475 --> 01:30:06,241
- 我知道他支持的是哪个队 - 哪天比赛？

3438
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,840
Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing. He can't be a quitter.

3439
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:07,880
He cannot be a quitter.

3440
01:30:06,812 --> 01:30:08,775
12月28号  这个赛季最后一场比赛

3441
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:12,520
You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and

3442
01:30:09,426 --> 01:30:10,916
- 天哪 - 跟富兰克林酒店的

3443
01:30:11,093 --> 01:30:14,294
双人自由舞比赛同一天

3444
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,080
it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it.

3445
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,360
There's only one way to get him to show.

3446
01:30:14,294 --> 01:30:16,538
兰迪  他们可是美国之队啊

3447
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,120
What's that? Oh, what's that?

3448
01:30:16,718 --> 01:30:17,764
难道你不相信美国之队吗？

3449
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,400
We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there.

3450
01:30:17,992 --> 01:30:19,952
对啊  兰迪  难道你不相信美国之队吗？？

3451
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:24,099
我当然相信美国之队  但要是我赢了

3452
01:30:24,272 --> 01:30:28,220
你们就完蛋了  餐厅也没了  什么都没了

3453
01:30:29,392 --> 01:30:32,617
- 有意思 - 不行  帕吉欧

3454
01:30:32,943 --> 01:30:34,410
我相信老鹰队  相信我儿子

3455
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,955
这个赌我打

3456
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,545
- 爸！ - 帕吉欧  不行  这是在赌命！

3457
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
We have to tell him that she's going.

3458
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,218
我有信心  我有信心 精进不休属于我们家

3459
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,680
But that's a lie! It's a white lie.

3460
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,720
It's a white lie, what's that matter? That's no big deal.

3461
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:44,124
而不是纽约州

3462
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,000
So it's a little lie. There's no other way.

3463
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,580
爸  听我说  我以前不知道“精进不休”

3464
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,080
You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that

3465
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,480
是纽约州格言

3466
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,601
我以前也不知道  但我现在知道了

3467
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,320
he can live his life without ruining it.

3468
01:30:48,731 --> 01:30:51,006
我知道  但听我说  这是在赌命  爸

3469
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,960
No. I don't approve. You can't do it.

3470
01:30:51,142 --> 01:30:52,455
这是在赌命  你不能这么做  你不能这么做

3471
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,800
兰迪  你意下如何…

3472
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,209
闭嘴  你说得够多了 兰迪  你意下如何？

3473
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,960
Well, you know, I didn't approve when you called her and you told

3474
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:59,156
我的小鹰  富兰克林之队 领先1.5分

3475
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,280
her where he was running, so she could ambush him. I didn't approve

3476
01:30:59,281 --> 01:30:59,965
我再让你3分

3477
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,621
帕吉欧  够了！兰迪  别打这个赌！

3478
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,040
of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this anyway. That's it.

3479
01:31:04,015 --> 01:31:07,270
- 我要让你10分 - 不  爸！

3480
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,440
We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.

3481
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:13,412
- 爸！ - 你必须把赌注押在牛仔队上

3482
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,240
You gotta be part of it. We have to do it.

3483
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,864
- 多洛蕾丝  还不快拦着他？ - 天啊！

3484
01:31:15,008 --> 01:31:18,426
你怎么能不打这个赌？我可让了你10分

3485
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,400
Aren't you nervous to be lying?

3486
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,408
这对你来说可是个天大的便宜

3487
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,840
Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best.

3488
01:31:21,533 --> 01:31:24,960
牛仔队都是懦夫  你也是  让你10分都不敢

3489
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,273
再加上  听好了  加上他们在舞蹈比赛的得分

3490
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:29,730
什么比赛来着  蒂芙尼  叫什么？

3491
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,800
?.. but if it was me reading the signs... . ?

3492
01:31:30,233 --> 01:31:32,474
- 什么？ 不行 - 你让那么多分真是疯了

3493
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,633
太荒唐了！这个我不同意！

3494
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:40,985
不过  连赌的赌法倒是不错

3495
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:46,765
- 什么  连赌可不行！ - 不  别这么做

3496
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,313
帕特  这个舞蹈比赛是怎么比的？

3497
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:51,750
我是说  分数是怎么算的？

3498
01:31:51,775 --> 01:31:52,858
我不知道  我怎么知道他们怎么算分数的！

3499
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:53,965
我们只是参赛者

3500
01:31:54,295 --> 01:31:56,179
又不是组织者  这个比赛很高端的

3501
01:31:56,299 --> 01:31:59,645
我不知道  别把这个算进赌局里

3502
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,940
- 兰迪  别… - 按照费城惯例

3503
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,181
每对舞者按1到10打分  10分最高

3504
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,320
That's it. Okay.

3505
01:32:06,278 --> 01:32:08,038
算四位评委的平均分

3506
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:12,000
好  按1到10打分是吧？你们水平怎么样？

3507
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:14,865
- 逊毙了 - 我们不差  帕特初学

3508
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:17,196
我还凑合  能参加比赛已经很不错了

3509
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,215
你们对手的水平怎么样？

3510
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:21,384
他们很棒  有的还是专业的

3511
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,530
- 他们很厉害？比你们强？ - 强得多

3512
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:28,884
强很多  那我要是说  你们只要拿到5分就行了

3513
01:32:29,035 --> 01:32:30,697
算是相当客气了吧？

3514
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,080
Hey.

3515
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:32,498
不行  不行  我们要是能得5分简直就是奇迹

3516
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:33,890
说回正题吧…

3517
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:35,254
拜托  我们5分总还是拿得到的！

3518
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,000
Hey, what's up?

3519
01:32:35,557 --> 01:32:37,617
饶了我吧！饶了我吧！

3520
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:39,900
- 我们不可能拿到5分！ - 就赌5分吧

3521
01:32:40,107 --> 01:32:40,919
我们当然能拿到5分

3522
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:42,680
Sorry I'm late.

3523
01:32:41,059 --> 01:32:43,240
爸  你说什么呢？你压根没见过我们跳舞！

3524
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:43,200
It's fine.

3525
01:32:43,497 --> 01:32:44,217
这才叫连赌嘛

3526
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:45,653
谁行行好  给我解释一下  什么叫连赌？

3527
01:32:45,847 --> 01:32:48,666
要么两局皆赢  要么全盘皆输

3528
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:51,185
老帕要是想赢  不光老鹰得打败牛仔

3529
01:32:51,185 --> 01:32:54,475
帕特和蒂芙尼还得在比赛中至少得到5分

3530
01:32:55,003 --> 01:32:57,623
- 这真的太疯狂了 - 这就叫连赌

3531
01:32:57,623 --> 01:32:59,095
握手成交

3532
01:33:00,391 --> 01:33:04,210
我不会掺和这件事的

3533
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:07,031
兰迪  你真是个小人  我不干了

3534
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,735
- 帕特  你不能退出 - 我不参加了

3535
01:33:10,066 --> 01:33:13,631
- 拜拜了 - 帕特  冷静点  好好想想

3536
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,175
- 帕特  不行 - 你要干什么？

3537
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,635
- 帕特 - 我不干了

3538
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:19,596
我们又站在了一码线上

3539
01:33:19,596 --> 01:33:22,753
德肖恩就是在这里一时失手

3540
01:33:22,753 --> 01:33:24,266
功败垂成  你现在也是这样

3541
01:33:24,451 --> 01:33:26,670
爸  这又算什么？

3542
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:28,710
不要拿我跟德肖恩・杰克逊比  这是两码事

3543
01:33:28,865 --> 01:33:30,750
我穿了他的球衣不代表…

3544
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:32,260
我不干了  对不起

3545
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:35,676
你这也太不讲义气了  如果换做是我

3546
01:33:35,815 --> 01:33:37,618
如果换做是我…

3547
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:40,345
如果换做是你？换做是你？好吧

3548
01:33:41,673 --> 01:33:44,422
帕特！你太不讲义气了！

3549
01:33:52,648 --> 01:33:54,195
我告诉过你  不要逼他的

3550
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:57,034
可他必须得参加  他不能半途而废

3551
01:33:57,254 --> 01:33:58,175
他不能半途而废

3552
01:33:58,295 --> 01:34:02,950
都怪你要搞那个愚蠢的连赌  他都不愿意跳舞了

3553
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:05,601
那对他很有好处的  全被你毁了

3554
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,640
Come on, it's gonna be great.

3555
01:34:05,725 --> 01:34:07,326
要让他参加比赛  只有一个办法

3556
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,040
Nikki's gonna be there. You know? Everything's gonna come together.

3557
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,790
- 什么办法？ - 什么？

3558
01:34:08,955 --> 01:34:11,159
我们得告诉他  尼基会去看

3559
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,800
It's what's meant to be. You okay?

3560
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,640
Don't get wobbly on me. I'm not.

3561
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,600
We have a dance to do. We have a parlay. You gotta stay focused.

3562
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,720
I'm focused. Okay, let's go.

3563
01:34:27,402 --> 01:34:30,124
- 她不可能去的 - 我们得告诉他她会去

3564
01:34:30,542 --> 01:34:31,607
我们必须得告诉他她会去

3565
01:34:31,785 --> 01:34:33,350
- 这是在骗他！ - 可这是为他好

3566
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,781
这是为他好  有什么关系？没什么大不了

3567
01:34:35,985 --> 01:34:37,855
- 只是撒个小谎而已 - 没别的办法了

3568
01:34:38,316 --> 01:34:41,234
我们得给他留下一线希望

3569
01:34:41,234 --> 01:34:43,407
他才不至于把自己这一辈子毁掉

3570
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,120
Look at the dancers. You see them? Shit.

3571
01:34:44,361 --> 01:34:48,240
我不同意  你们不能这么做

3572
01:34:48,664 --> 01:34:51,360
你要打电话给她  告诉她他在哪跑步

3573
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,920
Hey, Randy, Jake. What do we got?

3574
01:34:51,507 --> 01:34:54,835
她好埋伏在那的时候  我也不同意

3575
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,040
Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three.

3576
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,640
I'm worried about the bet.

3577
01:34:54,975 --> 01:34:58,755
可你还是那么做了  这回我也一样  就这么办

3578
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,480
Don't worry about the bet. I'm worried about the bet.

3579
01:34:59,240 --> 01:34:59,840
Holy shit.

3580
01:35:00,076 --> 01:35:01,637
我们要告诉他尼基会去

3581
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,000
Is this Dancing with the Stars?

3582
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,380
- 你不能戳穿 - 我们非这样做不可

3583
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,080
Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted em.

3584
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,000
Look at those fucking dancers!

3585
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:12,700
你撒谎的时候会紧张吗？

3586
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,680
You can give me the money now, you know?

3587
01:35:13,985 --> 01:35:18,340
有点吧  但也只能如此了

3588
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,360
Patty, Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five.

3589
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,160
That's all. You stay here and watch the game with me.

3590
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,880
The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that.

3591
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:27,440
Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay? I'll see you in a little bit.

3592
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:26,945
“但如果换做是我…”

3593
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,520
I'll see you up there, okay? Okay.

3594
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,600
Hey, Pat, Tiffany!

3595
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,200
Hey. What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man.

3596
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,080
Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy, I'll see you. Alright.

3597
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,640
Wish me luck, man.

3598
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:37,760
Excelsior!

3599
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,600
Wait, what's this?

3600
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,640
What? I thought you were doing it.

3601
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,840
Oh, I thought you were doing it. We're doing a dance thing anyway

3602
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:45,720
for God's sake.

3603
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,320
I want you to remember everything. I want you to remember all of the

3604
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,360
good stuff that we have here.

3605
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,600
Of course I do. Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.

3606
01:35:59,607 --> 01:36:00,968
就这样吧

3607
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,080
Hi, good evening. Evening.

3608
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,360
Check in? How many dancers are there?

3609
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:14,600
What?! Nikki? Nikki.

3610
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,440
Oh, Jesus.

3611
01:36:27,191 --> 01:36:28,455
你好

3612
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,720
What the fuck?

3613
01:36:33,355 --> 01:36:34,637
你好吗？

3614
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,160
Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.

3615
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,320
You're killing me. You're killing me!

3616
01:36:39,034 --> 01:36:39,537
不好意思  我迟到了

3617
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,560
Tiffany, please. She'll see how well he's doing,

3618
01:36:39,584 --> 01:36:40,084
没关系

3619
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:43,960
maybe she'll lift the restraining order.

3620
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

3621
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,520
Pat told me. He told me you should never throw a marriage

3622
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,520
out the window.

3623
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,240
Pat did not say that. He didn't say that.

3624
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,720
He said it several times, Tiffany, and this is his chance.

3625
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,000
You gotta give him a chance.

3626
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,480
Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?

3627
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:57,720
So, you want another one? Sure.

3628
01:38:06,725 --> 01:38:08,106
一定会很棒的

3629
01:38:08,565 --> 01:38:12,695
尼基会去  你知道吗？一切都要好起来了

3630
01:38:13,307 --> 01:38:15,570
这是注定的  你没事吧？

3631
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:20,622
- 别魂不守舍的 - 我没有

3632
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:24,735
我们有场舞要跳  还有个赌要打呢  专心点

3633
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:26,958
- 我很专心 - 好  我们走

3634
01:38:45,205 --> 01:38:48,245
- 看看那一对  看见没有？ - 完了

3635
01:38:53,019 --> 01:38:55,306
兰迪  杰克  情况怎么样？

3636
01:38:55,691 --> 01:38:57,535
达拉斯又得了1分  打平了  3比3

3637
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,183
我很担心这个赌

3638
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:01,610
- 别担心 - 我很担心

3639
01:39:01,907 --> 01:39:02,540
神啊

3640
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,360
So what do you do? I'm a lawyer. Litigator, actually.

3641
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,940
这是“与星共舞”吗？

3642
01:39:10,214 --> 01:39:12,170
你事先干嘛不侦察好他们的实力

3643
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,800
Oh, the arguing kind.

3644
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:14,190
瞧那些选手跳的多好啊！

3645
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,040
And the scores for Santos and Aguilar are: seven point six, seven point three, seven point four, and

3646
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:20,090
你现在就可以把钱给我了

3647
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:25,200
six point nine for an average score of seven point three.

3648
01:39:20,865 --> 01:39:22,910
帕特  我们只要拿到5分就行了

3649
01:39:23,115 --> 01:39:24,765
你待在这陪我看比赛

3650
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:34,280
Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas! They are on their way to the playoffs.

3651
01:39:25,169 --> 01:39:27,624
帕特跟我在一起时老鹰打得更好

3652
01:39:27,955 --> 01:39:31,310
别担心  我们会做好的  一会见

3653
01:39:31,475 --> 01:39:32,836
- 你到那去找我  好吗？ - 好

3654
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:34,625
你们好  帕特  蒂芙尼！

3655
01:39:35,582 --> 01:39:37,423
这场面可真隆重啊

3656
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:39,285
兄弟  一会儿见

3657
01:39:39,435 --> 01:39:40,930
祝我好运

3658
01:39:41,385 --> 01:39:42,070
精进不休！

3659
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:43,800
Where's Tiffany?

3660
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,400
I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?

3661
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:46,070
这是怎么回事？

3662
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,640
You gotta find her. I know, Mom, I know.

3663
01:39:46,127 --> 01:39:47,150
什么？我以为是你先牵的

3664
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:49,797
我以为是你先牵的  反正我们等会儿要跳舞

3665
01:39:59,162 --> 01:40:01,428
我希望你能记住这一切  我希望你能记住

3666
01:40:01,571 --> 01:40:02,511
我们现在拥有的一切美好的东西

3667
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:05,910
- 我当然记得 - 去签到吧  我去找维罗妮卡

3668
01:40:07,445 --> 01:40:08,485
- 你们  晚上好 - 晚上好

3669
01:40:08,715 --> 01:40:11,886
- 签到？ - 有多少选手参赛？

3670
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,400
Hey, WHAT are you doing? She's fine, buddy, she's with me.

3671
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,760
She's fine? Yeah.

3672
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:21,877
什么？！尼基？是尼基

3673
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,200
Why don't you shut up, okay? How many drinks have you had?

3674
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,760
I've had two vodkas. Listen, I don't know what choices

3675
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,160
you've made, but you gotta deal with it right now, okay? We're in this.

3676
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,500
天哪

3677
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:25,920
We're in what?

3678
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:30,080
Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.

3679
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,960
You know, I used to think that you were the best thing that ever

3680
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,240
happened to me, but now I think that you might maybe be the worst

3681
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,920
thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.

3682
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,960
Good for you.

3683
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:45,960
And the scores for Makarov and Tretiak are: six point seven, eight

3684
01:40:41,235 --> 01:40:42,535
搞什么鬼？

3685
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:45,055
亲爱的  亲爱的  宝贝儿  冷静

3686
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:51,560
point one, seven point five and six point five for an average score of

3687
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:47,295
我恨你  我恨你！

3688
01:40:47,473 --> 01:40:49,635
蒂芙尼  她要是看到他恢复得多好

3689
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:51,371
说不定就会取消限制令了

3690
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
seven point two.

3691
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:53,765
天哪  天哪

3692
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,890
帕特对我说过  他说你永远也不该

3693
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:57,930
放弃一段婚姻

3694
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,000
They were great and they only got a seven point two.

3695
01:40:58,531 --> 01:41:00,765
帕特没这么说过  他没这么说过

3696
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,441
他说过好多次  蒂芙尼  这对他来说是大好机会

3697
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,200
This is a tough room.

3698
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:04,851
你得给他一个机会

3699
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,120
Got it.

3700
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:12,200
Up next, ladies and gentlemen please welcome Pat Solatano, Jr. and Tiffany Maxwell.

3701
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:18,680
Damn. Let's go, Patty! Come on, Pat!

3702
01:41:36,176 --> 01:41:40,655
酒保！酒保  来杯伏特加

3703
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:08,036
- 再来一杯？ - 好

3704
01:43:18,156 --> 01:43:22,735
- 你是做什么的？ - 我是个律师  诉讼律师

3705
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:28,385
就是跟人辩论的那种

3706
01:43:28,485 --> 01:43:32,813
7.6分  7.3分  7.4分

3707
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:39,245
6.9分  平均分是7.3分

3708
01:43:40,054 --> 01:43:46,000
3  2  1  费城击败了达拉斯

3709
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,988
他们即将进入季后赛

3710
01:43:58,171 --> 01:43:58,811
蒂芙尼呢？

3711
01:43:58,890 --> 01:44:00,370
不知道  妈  你看见她没有？

3712
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:02,680
- 你得找到她 - 我知道  妈  我知道

3713
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:31,587
- 你在干什么？ - 她没事的  她跟我一起的

3714
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:32,980
- 她没事？ - 是啊

3715
01:44:33,138 --> 01:44:35,533
你就不能闭嘴吗  你喝了多少酒？

3716
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,720
Alright, let's see the scores for Solatano and Maxwell.

3717
01:44:35,924 --> 01:44:38,220
- 两杯伏特加 - 我不知道你是不是改了主意

3718
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:44,400
We have a four point nine, four eight, a four nine...

3719
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:41,270
但你别胡闹  我们是一伙的

3720
01:44:41,845 --> 01:44:42,558
我们是一伙什么？

3721
01:44:42,765 --> 01:44:46,880
下一组  帕特・索拉塔诺和蒂芙尼・麦克斯维尔

3722
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,760
That's really too bad, guys. That's a lot of fours.

3723
01:44:47,167 --> 01:44:48,827
我曾以为  遇见你是我这辈子最幸运的事

3724
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:54,400
... and and a five point four for an average score of. . five point zero.

3725
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:51,510
但现在  我觉得这是最倒霉的一件事

3726
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:54,020
真希望我们从没见过

3727
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:59,320
Sorry about that, guys.

3728
01:44:54,475 --> 01:44:55,080
真有你的

3729
01:44:55,230 --> 01:45:03,230
马卡洛夫和特莉迪亚克的得分是6.7分

3730
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,880
Dad, Dad, did the Eagles win?

3731
01:45:03,606 --> 01:45:09,268
8.1分  7.5分  和6.5分  平均分为

3732
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:08,640
The Eagles won, forty-four-six! They won, forty- four-six!

3733
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,000
Come on!

3734
01:45:09,761 --> 01:45:10,785
7.2分

3735
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:14,360
Why are they so excited about a five?

3736
01:45:16,990 --> 01:45:20,173
他们跳得那么好  居然只有7.2分

3737
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:21,740
竞争真激烈

3738
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:22,540
拿着

3739
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:28,124
女士们  先生们  下面有请

3740
01:45:28,137 --> 01:45:30,801
小帕特・索拉塔诺和蒂芙尼・麦克斯维尔

3741
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:37,555
帕特  加油！

3742
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:54,160
How are you? You okay? Good. How are you? I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.

3743
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,440
You looked really happy out there. Did I?

3744
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,240
Yeah. Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing?

3745
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:05,920
You look incredible. Thank you.

3746
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,280
You lost a lot of weight. I've been reading your books and,

3747
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,400
I have a positive attitude. I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.

3748
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,160
Where's Tiffany? She left. What do you mean, she left?

3749
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,560
She left. What do you think! Where is she?

3750
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,360
Let me tell you, I know you don't wanna listen to your father,

3751
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,880
I didn't listen to mine but I'm telling you, you gotta pay

3752
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,760
attention to the signs. When life reaches out with a moment like

3753
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,240
this, it's a sin if you don't reach back. I'm telling you, it's a sin

3754
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,240
if you don't reach back, and it'll haunt you for the rest of your days

3755
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,040
like a curse. You're facing a big challenge in your life right now,

3756
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,720
at this very moment, right here. That girl loves you, she really

3757
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,960
loves you. And I don't know if Nikki ever did, but she sure as

3758
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,640
hell doesn't love you right now. I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.

3759
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:44,880
I love you, Dad.

3760
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:17,680
Hey! Would you just leave me alone?!

3761
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,240
Wait a second! I have one more letter for you to read, okay?

3762
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,600
What the fuck is the matter with you? Give it to her yourself!

3763
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,880
Let me say something. You don't ever have to see me again if you

3764
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:25,840
just read it, alright?

3765
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,160
This is so fucked up. Yeah, just read it.

3766
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:32,760
Dear Tiffany...

3767
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:38,400
?.. I know you wrote the letter.

3768
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,080
The only way you could meet my crazy... . ?

3769
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:52,440
?.. was by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you.

3770
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:53,400
I love you.

3771
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:01,640
I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so long for me to

3772
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,840
catch up. I just got stuck. Pat. ?

3773
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:05,110
索拉塔诺和麦克斯维尔的得分

3774
01:49:05,782 --> 01:49:12,085
4.9分  4.8分  4.9分

3775
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:11,560
I wrote that a week ago.

3776
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,640
You wrote that a week ago? Yes, I did.

3777
01:49:13,832 --> 01:49:16,964
太糟了  这么多4分

3778
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:19,480
You let me lie to you for a week? I was trying to be romantic.

3779
01:49:16,964 --> 01:49:19,207
5.4分

3780
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,400
You love me? Yeah, I do.

3781
01:49:20,598 --> 01:49:23,805
平均分为5.0分

3782
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:32,120
Okay.

3783
01:49:33,076 --> 01:49:34,455
爸  老鹰赢了吗？

3784
01:49:34,761 --> 01:49:38,872
老鹰赢了  44比6！他们赢了  44比6！

3785
01:49:41,503 --> 01:49:44,767
休息10分钟  5分值得这样吗？

3786
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:09,240
The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.

3787
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:14,480
And I can't begin to explain that- -or the craziness inside myself and

3788
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:18,320
everybody else, but guess what? Sunday is my favorite day again.

3789
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:24,560
I think of everything everyone did for me and I feel like --a very lucky guy.

3790
01:50:20,893 --> 01:50:21,881
- 你好吗？ - 很好  你呢？

3791
01:50:21,881 --> 01:50:24,806
我很好  谢谢

3792
01:50:25,151 --> 01:50:27,170
- 你刚才看上去真的很开心 - 是吗？

3793
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:30,040
We have to beat the Vikings by three. I'm givin' you a six, which

3794
01:50:28,005 --> 01:50:30,100
- 是的 - 是啊  谁想得到我还能跳舞呢？

3795
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:33,680
is very generous after the beating you just took. So what are we

3796
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,960
doin', what are we talkin' about here?

3797
01:50:35,205 --> 01:50:37,055
- 你看上去好极了 - 谢谢

3798
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,920
I'd like to do another parlay if we make it to the next round, that's all.

3799
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:40,280
But we are gonna make it to the next round. We're gonna beat...

3800
01:50:37,882 --> 01:50:40,554
- 你瘦了很多 - 我一直在读你的书

3801
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,840
No, that was me that did that. No that was me.

3802
01:50:40,699 --> 01:50:43,806
我态度很积极  在吃药  还在看心理医生

3803
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:47,320
That was me. I played the Jack. So you put the bread crumbs, the

3804
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,600
garlic in the steak and you roll it up with the toothpicks?

3805
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,760
Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours, plus.

3806
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,680
Everything's good, everything's good, yeah. I got you, you're all

3807
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:59,120
down.  No, Randy, he's complaining. You know he lost a lot

3808
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,200
of money. He's moaning and groaning. The restaurant's

3809
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,440
happening because of Randy, so everything's good.

3812
01:51:46,185 --> 01:51:46,782
- 蒂芙尼呢？ - 她走了

3813
01:51:46,782 --> 01:51:48,305
什么  她走了？

3814
01:51:48,885 --> 01:51:50,706
- 走了就是走了  你想什么呢！ - 她去哪儿了？

3815
01:51:51,595 --> 01:51:53,655
听我说  我知道你不想听你老爸的话

3816
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:57,840
我以前也不听我老爸的话  但你听着

3817
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,265
当生命在这样一个时刻给你发出信号时

3818
01:51:59,405 --> 01:52:02,126
你如果不回应  那就是罪过  给我听好

3819
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,664
你如果不回应  就像个诅咒

3820
01:52:04,664 --> 01:52:08,391
你整个余生都会为之后悔

3821
01:52:08,391 --> 01:52:09,871
你人生中的一个重大转折此刻就在你眼前

3822
01:52:09,871 --> 01:52:10,750
就在此时此刻那个姑娘爱上你了

3823
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:13,040
我不知道尼基到底有没有爱过你

3824
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:14,421
但她现在肯定已经不爱你了

3825
01:52:14,421 --> 01:52:15,901
你给我听着  这次别再搞砸了

3826
01:52:19,230 --> 01:52:20,275
爸  我爱你

3827
01:52:53,814 --> 01:52:54,802
你别管我  行吗？

3828
01:52:54,857 --> 01:52:57,217
等等！我还有封信要给你看

3829
01:52:57,395 --> 01:52:59,835
你他妈什么毛病？自己递给她啊！

3830
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,089


3831
01:52:59,935 --> 01:53:01,956
听我说  只要你读了这封信

3832
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:02,980
就再也不用见到我了  行吗？

3833
01:53:04,104 --> 01:53:06,427
- 真是胡闹 - 你读就是了

3834
01:53:08,881 --> 01:53:10,195
亲爱的蒂芙尼…

3835
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,059
我知道那封信是你写的

3836
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:26,159
唯一能与我的疯狂相匹配的…

3837
01:53:26,215 --> 01:53:30,670
就是你也在做同样疯狂的事  谢谢你

3838
01:53:30,695 --> 01:53:31,695
我爱你

3839
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:37,443
从我第一眼看见你就意识到了

3840
01:53:37,443 --> 01:53:41,680
很抱歉我花了这么久才想明白

3841
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:43,639
我只是陷入过去了  帕特

3842
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,639
我一个礼拜前写的

3843
01:53:52,225 --> 01:53:54,895
- 你一个礼拜前写的？ - 是的

3844
01:53:54,955 --> 01:53:57,118
你任由我骗了你一个礼拜？

3845
01:53:57,118 --> 01:53:58,900
我觉得这样比较浪漫

3846
01:54:02,373 --> 01:54:04,979
- 你爱我？ - 是的

3847
01:54:11,565 --> 01:54:12,080
好吧

3848
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:52,055
生活会将你的心彻底击碎  这是肯定的

3849
01:54:52,055 --> 01:54:54,456
我无法解释这一点

3850
01:54:54,456 --> 01:54:57,906
也无法解释在我和其他所有人内心的疯狂

3851
01:54:57,906 --> 01:55:01,437
但你猜怎么着？星期天又成了我最爱的一天

3852
01:55:01,722 --> 01:55:08,202
我想到了每个人为我做的一切  我觉得很幸运

3853
01:55:10,225 --> 01:55:12,453
我们得赢维京队3分  我让你6分

3854
01:55:12,608 --> 01:55:16,275
- 这相当慷慨了 - 这是怎么回事？

3855
01:55:16,425 --> 01:55:17,945
你在说什么？

3856
01:55:18,010 --> 01:55:20,374
要是我们能打到下一轮的话

3857
01:55:20,374 --> 01:55:21,817
我还想再打个连赌  就这样

3858
01:55:21,817 --> 01:55:23,140
但我们打不到下一轮的……

3859
01:55:23,286 --> 01:55:25,795
- 这张牌是我打的 - 不  是我打的

3860
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:30,482
- 是我打的  我出了J - 你放了面包屑

3861
01:55:30,632 --> 01:55:32,952
和大蒜在牛排里面  然后用牙签卷起来？

3862
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:36,155
没错  然后再烤上三小时左右

3863
01:55:36,549 --> 01:55:39,190
一切都好  一切都好  我知道  你很郁闷

3864
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:42,809
不  兰迪在抱怨  你也知道他输了很多钱

3865
01:55:42,944 --> 01:55:45,024
他在唉声叹气

3866
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:48,340
餐厅的事多亏了兰迪  一切都好

3867
01:56:06,722 --> 01:56:11,794
谢谢观赏
