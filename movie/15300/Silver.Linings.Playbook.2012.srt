4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,140
What, are you kidding me? Sundays?

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,020
I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,790
The whole family's together.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,860
Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,950
We're all watching the game.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,200
Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes,

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,900
I was negative. You didn't even

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,470
know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,970
I just didn't appreciate it or you before.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,720
Come on. Time to go.

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,420
I lost all that. I blew it.

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,000
But you also blew it. We can get it back.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,400
We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm better now and I hope you are, too.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,780
And I'm gonna appreciate...

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,240
I'll be there in a minute, okay?

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,570
Doctor's waiting. Let's go.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,760
I'll be there in a minute.

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,520
That's true love.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,560
Yeah, that's when I had long hair.

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,580
People say I talk about my hair too much.

25
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,190
And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far.

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,270
He cut this side back too far

27
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,850
trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that.

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,610
I said, just cut it the way you cut it...

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,530
Once you get in the right frame of mind,

30
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,230
I think anything's possible.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,040
I think we get, we so often

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,210
get caught in this state of negativity and

33
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,160
it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,270
Technically,

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,110
you can take him out against our recommendation,

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,860
but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court.

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,140
And he's just getting used to the routine here.

38
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,190
I don't want him to get used to the routine here.

39
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,360
Eight months is already long enough.

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,360
Mom.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,180
Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?

42
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,160
What? I don't understand.

43
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,180
Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

44
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,360
I guess everybody's leaving today!

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,580
Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you.

46
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,310
Pat told me all about you,

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,960
how God made you rich in character,

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,490
and you're the mighty oak that holds

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,650
the household together,

50
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,820
and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,790
when the Birds play.

52
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,480
Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.

53
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,800
Bad combination.

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,490
Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,790
That was when I was an X-ray technician

56
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,670
with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to

57
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,130
medication and I took advantage of it.

58
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,980
That's when my hair was long, too.

59
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,310
But my hair only grew when I was older.

60
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,940
'Cause when I was younger,

61
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,550
my hair didn't grow because my brother...

62
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,610
Remember I told you about my brother,

63
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,400
he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn't get a Jheri curl

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,990
because my hair didn't grow long enough.

65
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,910
I was so jealous of my brother...

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,870
-But Wait a minute, Wait a minute. -Hello?

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,180
-Yeah! It looks great now. -You like it?

68
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,430
-No, It's good now. -Yes, it is.

69
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,230
Wait, you're going the wrong way!

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,330
What? Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away.

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,250
You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave.

72
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,930
All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.

73
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,600
Let's just talk about this.

74
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,760
-Mom, just listen. -Don't tou...ch

75
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
the steering...wheel!

76
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,650
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.

77
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,660
I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?

78
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,960
I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,180
It's my fault. Pat didn't know.

80
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,540
Pat didn't know. He's my friend,

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,000
so he was rootin' for me.

82
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,730
I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital,

83
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,440
but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital,

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,690
but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see,

85
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,910
he's fine. It's my fault.

86
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,810
Mom, can we stop at the library?

87
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,560
I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.

88
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,670
Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.

89
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,840
DeSean Jackson.

90
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,140
What happened to DeSean Jackson?

91
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,270
Come on, tell me that one.

92
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,610
It's insanity. He spikes the ball

93
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,090
at the one yard line. The one fucking-yard line.

94
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,940
I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.

95
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,000
He celebreated before it was even in.

96
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,190
You know something? It's nothing new.

97
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,080
Your team does that all the time.

98
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,810
They get close... and then they blow it.

99
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,020
They got an inferiority complex.

100
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,540
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?

101
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,410
What makes the Cowboys America's Team?

102
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,260
Because we are, we're America's Team.

103
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,780
You should be ashamed of yourself. We're in Philadelphia,

104
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,750
what's the matter with you? You're a fucking traitor.

105
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,240
What's more American than a cowboy?

106
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,620
You know what's more American? What?

107
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,110
Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American.

108
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,840
Benjamin Franklin?

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,550
Benjamin Franklin.

110
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,300
The founder of our country, here in Philadelphia.

111
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,080
You mean the guy with the...

112
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,220
...little glasses and the long scraggly hair?

113
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,790
What about the lightning with the kite?

114
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,020
He stood in the storm with a kite.

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,230
If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill,

116
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,750
nobody would even know who he is.

117
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,850
What are you doing? No, no,

118
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,190
no, no. Don't touch them, don't touch them.

119
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,180
I didn't even touch them. Why are you..., don't blame me.

120
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,020
Who did this? Who took, who took, who took the...

121
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,740
the remotes like this? Did you do this, Randy?

122
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,420
No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact,

123
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
I don't know why you need so many.

124
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,300
There she is! Look how beautiful!

125
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,330
What?! What's this?

126
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,790
Everything good?

127
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,600
-Where is it? -It's right here.

128
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,690
You got it. We got that.

129
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,360
We don't want them to steal that.

130
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,930
-You still got yours? -Yeah, I got mine.

131
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,040
So what, you don't talk to me?

132
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,370
You didn't tell me you took him out.

133
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,210
He's ready. Look at him.

134
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,860
You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?

135
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,260
-Don't worry about that. -I wanna make sure when you come out

136
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,000
that you're okay, and she didn't say anything.

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,340
-You didn't tell me? -The court said yes. Don't worry.

138
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,130
Yeah, but what did the doctor say?

139
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,340
Because the, the court listens to the doctor.

140
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,410
Yeah, and the court said-

141
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,910
The court listens to the doctor, the doctor-

142
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,650
Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go.

143
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,270
Don't worry.

144
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,160
Dad, I'm in there because of the court.

145
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,680
That's the agreement that we made months ago.

146
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,610
It was a plea bargain with the courts.

147
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,040
The lawyer, he instructed me,

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,320
he said that what we should plead that, and

149
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,850
then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.

150
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,910
It's all under control.

151
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,870
Okay, okay. Congratulations.

152
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,690
Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?

153
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,890
You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.

154
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,380
It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.

155
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,270
How you gonna pay for it?

156
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,140
I'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it.

157
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,920
From your bookmaking?

158
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,760
-Who told you that?  -Mom told me. Outside.

159
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,770
I did not. No, I didn't.

160
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,120
You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about?

161
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,020
Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs,

162
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,060
you said, don't say anything,

163
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,900
but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking.

164
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,920
Why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him?

165
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,970
He has the wrong idea.

166
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,400
Everything's fine, Patrick.

167
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,850
I'm more concerned about you than anything else.

168
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,730
Good, Dad. Good.

169
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,190
Okay, the question, the big question,

170
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,560
is what are you gonna do with yourself?

171
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,620
What am I gonna do? I'm getting in shape, I'm getting trim,

172
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,650
I'm getting really fit for Nikki.

173
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,980
I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus

174
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,810
and get my old job back.

175
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,590
Nikki sold the house. She left.

176
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,050
Didn't your mother tell you that?

177
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,890
Let me tell you something.

178
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,520
You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad?

179
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,970
All right? Our marriage...

180
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,730
we're very, very much in love,

181
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,560
okay? Just like you two.

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,380
Listen, Patrick, she's gone.

183
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,110
She's not around anymore. Nikki left.

184
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,460
What are you doing, Dad? You know...

185
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,340
-Excelsior. Excelsior. -What does that mean?

186
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,010
It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this

187
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining,

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,820
that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit.

189
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,420
That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.

190
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,280
What the fuck?!

191
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
Stupid fucking book!

192
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,930
I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids.

193
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,450
I mean the whole time, let me just break it down for you

194
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,470
the whole time you're

195
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,410
rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war

196
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,990
and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...

197
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,570
It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.

198
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,050
...and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting

199
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,760
blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine.

200
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,060
But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful?

201
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,840
She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and

202
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,100
they're gonna be happy, and they're

203
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,780
gonna be drinking wine and they dance

204
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,940
they both like to dance with each other,

205
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,110
there's scenes of them dancing,

206
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,550
which was boring,

207
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,840
but I liked it, because they were happy.

208
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,850
You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending.

209
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,930
She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard

210
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,970
enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is.

211
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,110
Can't somebody say, let's be positive?

212
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,490
Let's have a good ending to the story?

213
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,970
Pat, you owe us an apology.

214
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,120
Mom, for what, I can't apologize.

215
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,940
I'm not gonna apologize for this.

216
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,370
You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of

217
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,770
Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.

218
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too.

219
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,750
Why didn't you run with me?

220
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,100
I was reading.

221
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,100
Please. Do us a favor, don't read for a while.

222
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,560
-What are you wearing a garbage bag for? -I'm gonna go run now.

223
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,060
Wait, wait, wait. You have to fix this window.

224
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,650
-I'll fix it when I get back. -Fix it now.

225
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,960
Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,980
I don't wanna go to therapy.

227
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,200
You have to go. It's part of the deal.

228
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,160
You can't live with us and not go.

229
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,090
Is that song really playing?

230
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,260
We have music sometimes.

231
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,890
That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?

232
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,860
I can't.

233
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,360
What do you mean, you can't?

234
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,030
I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I-

235
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,220
Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this?

236
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,830
Is there a speaker here?

237
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,000
Is, is the speaker here?

238
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,910
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay... I'm sorry.

239
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,740
I'll fix all this, okay?

240
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,150
That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. Alright!

241
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,190
That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's...

242
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,500
You can call me Cliff, please.

243
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,540
Yeah, Cliff, that's not

244
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,100
the way you're supposed to meet people, okay?

245
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,600
You should write that down in your, I don't know

246
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,090
your little book you write stuff down in.

247
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,850
I'm sorry about that song. I just

248
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,220
wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you.

249
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,050
Bravo. It's a trigger.

250
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,420
I'm not gonna take any meds,

251
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,960
I should just tell you that right now.

252
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,850
No, You have to take medicine.

253
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,250
No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy-

254
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,940
No, you will have to take medication.

255
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,280
I don't want any meds, Doctor.

256
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,660
Look, I am not the explosion guy,okay?

257
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,410
My father is the explosion guy.

258
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:29,910
I'm not that guy.

259
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,520
He got kicked out of that stadium he beat

260
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,940
up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.

261
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,690
-I had one incident. -One incident can change a lifetime.

262
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,760
But I'm ready.

263
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street.

264
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,970
She just needs to take responsibility for hers.

265
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,990
What's hers?

266
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,840
What's hers? Are you joking?

267
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,650
Let's go back to the incident.

268
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,180
I come home from work after I..

269
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,180
left early, which I never do by the way,

270
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,320
fight with Nancy, the high school ...principal.

271
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,000
I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding.

272
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,230
The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us.

273
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,010
That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd,

274
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,980
'cause I should have.

275
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,620
I come home, what do I see?

276
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,100
I walk in the door and I see underwear and

277
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,230
pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it,

278
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,970
and I walk up the stairs, and all...

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
...all of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the DVD

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song,

281
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,120
and then I look down and I see my wife's...

282
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,010
...panties on the ground and then

283
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,020
...I look up and I see her naked in the shower

284
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,290
...and I think,that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower.

285
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,120
What a perfect thing.

286
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,940
I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there.

287
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,860
We never fuck in the shower anymore.

288
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
Maybe today we will.

289
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,270
I pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...

290
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,140
...teacher with tenure.

291
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,760
And you know what he says to me?

292
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,110
-You should probably go. -That's what he says to me.

293
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,750
So yeah, I snapped.

294
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,020
I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking

295
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,220
chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.

296
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,210
All right. Can you talk

297
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,780
about something that you did, before or after?

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,990
Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,840
I told them that my wife and the history guy

300
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,790
were plotting against me

301
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,210
by embezzling money from the local high school, which

302
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,220
wasn't true... It was a delusion.

303
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,420
And we later found out from the hospital

304
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,730
that's because I'm,

305
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,950
...undiagnosed bipolar.

306
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,580
Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking

307
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,580
brought on by severe stress,

308
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,650
which rarely happens, thank God.

309
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,640
And then the shower incident happened

310
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,450
and that's when everything snapped,

311
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,090
so I then realized that, I've been dealing with

312
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,870
this my whole life.

313
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,010
And without any supervision I've been doing it all

314
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,400
on my own with no help

315
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,070
and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.

316
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,360
That had to be hard.

317
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,250
Yeah. It's a lot to deal with,

318
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,190
especially when you don't know what the hell is happening,

319
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,410
which I do now. Sort of.

320
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,550
Pat, you have to take your medication.

321
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,000
I can't, Mom. I can't.

322
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,060
I will call them. They'll come for you.

323
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,500
Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that.

324
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,180
Why would you call them?

325
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:14,980
What's up?

326
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,260
I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them,

327
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,820
Mom. I don't feel good.

328
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,150
I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated.

329
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,500
I don't like the way it makes me look.

330
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,240
Why don't you just take your medication?

331
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,140
You've gotta take your medication.

332
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,810
Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out,

333
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,340
that's what I'm doin'.

334
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,770
Why is he wearing a garbage bag?

335
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,320
Why are you wearing a garbage bag?

336
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,440
To sweat.

337
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,620
Sit down. We're seven minutes in,

338
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,790
no score. Come on, help turn the juju around.

339
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,780
I don't believe in juju, Dad.

340
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,430
Come on, Mister Excelsior.

341
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,110
You wanna be positive? Be positive. Sit down.

342
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,630
All right, all right.

343
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,080
Come on.

344
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,480
For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game.

345
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,600
He says you're good luck, honey.

346
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,350
What's that in your hand?

347
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,740
It's a... see?

348
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,920
-Handkerchief? -Yeah.

349
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,860
That's OCD. That's crazy.

350
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,490
What OCD?

351
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,920
I want my son to watch the game with me, so sue me.

352
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,320
Just sit down, come on. I want you to watch the game with me.

353
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,220
I'm not superstitious. That's a small thing that I do.

354
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,150
If I make a lot of money,

355
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,750
what's the difference if I do this or that?

356
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,720
It's a small thing. Sit down. Come on.

357
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,820
I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.

358
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,290
You see?! You see that?! You're meant to be here!

359
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,850
This is special. Everything happens for a reason.

360
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,930
That's why you came home. Embrace it! Embrace it!

361
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm the reason? I don't think so.

362
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,760
Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. I got your whole sheet.

363
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,240
-Mom. -Yeah. No, no...

364
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,550
...I'm just confirming.

365
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,030
I'm just confirming. Okay.

366
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

367
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,770
Can I do.. an interview

368
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,070
-for a school project on mental illness? -No.

369
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,180
-It's for a school project!  -Don't pay any attention.

370
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,270
Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it? That's him.

371
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,410
Is he the guy who's having the problem?

372
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,320
People are stupid. They, they,

373
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,590
they, they don't know what they're saying.

374
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,240
Yeah, that's the one.

375
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,780
Don't let them hurt your feelings.

376
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,910
-Pat, don't look for Nikki! -Take your camera and get out of here!

377
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,370
-Patrick, please. -Pat!

378
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,380
-Patty! -Don't look for Nikki!

379
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,310
Ms. Meckers!

380
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,410
Oh, God! Oh, God!

381
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,780
Nance! This is my lucky day!

382
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,780
Look at you working on a Sunday!

383
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,640
How are you?

384
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,200
What are you doing here?

385
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,470
I just came by to say hi,

386
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,120
to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.

387
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,880
You shouldn't be here.

388
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,130
I'll work full-time, half-time.

389
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,850
I'll work sub, I'll work history, whatever you want.

390
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,860
Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.

391
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,290
I got it. I got it. I got it.

392
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,740
Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something.

393
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,370
Does Nikki still work here?

394
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,760
You know I can't tell you that.

395
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,140
But Doug Culpepper is still here.

396
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,130
Why would you tell me that?

397
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,890
You know he broke up my marriage.

398
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,910
What, are you being, a troublemaker?

399
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,000
You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight?

400
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,710
I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.

401
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,330
Get away from me! Get away!

402
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,270
I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay?

403
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,650
I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good.

404
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,450
Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.

405
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,630
I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?

406
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,610
You just have to give it some time.

407
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,120
Yes.

408
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,570
You know, a lot went down. People will get over it.

409
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,690
It'll be all good. It'll work out.

410
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,740
Yes! It will be!

411
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,140
I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy!

412
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,490
A silver development! That's a silver lining!

413
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,290
Good luck.

414
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,780
Ronnie! Pat.

415
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,730
There he is! He's back!

416
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,250
Welcome home.

417
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Thank you.

418
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,390
Welcome back, man.

419
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,310
Yeah, I'm out.

420
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,370
Yeah? You're out out?

421
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,470
Cool, man. You lost a lot of weight.

422
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,360
I almost didn't recognize you.

423
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,170
Thank you.

424
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,190
I'm sorry I didn't visit

425
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,640
you in the hospital. You know, work's out of

426
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,900
control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back.

427
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,260
I missed you. I really need someone to talk to.

428
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,120
You gotta come see the baby.

429
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,800
She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.

430
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,310
Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.

431
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,440
'Cause you think Veronica still hates you?

432
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,400
-I know Veronica still hates me. -That's not true.

433
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,440
Yes, it is. Nikki always said that

434
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,920
Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar

435
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,170
where she keeps his balls, in her purse.

436
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,880
-That's not true.  -Ronnie! What are you doing?

437
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,820
Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you,

438
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,270
you're wrong because

439
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,690
why would she tell me to invite you to dinner?

440
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,170
Did you invite him?

441
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,160
Yes.

442
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,530
Can he make it?

443
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,860
I don't know yet!

444
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,260
Can you make it next Sunday?

445
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,100
Sure.

446
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,600
I'll see you next Sunday.

447
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,990
Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right?

448
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,280
Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?

449
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,840
Yeah.

450
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,930
Get in here, please. I need you.

451
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,060
Okay.

452
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,850
As soon as you left, the Redskins

453
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,050
threw a trick play, a pitch out to Randal El.

454
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,530
Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging it,

455
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,260
loses the challenge, loses the game.

456
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,610
You're in this house, please show some respect for what I do.

457
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,340
And we should spend time together anyway.

458
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,980
I'm trying to keep you out of trouble, please.

459
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,970
I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news.

460
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,820
What's that? What's the good news?

461
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,450
Things are looking up.

462
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,870
Oh, are they?

463
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it.

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,960
Listen, she might be with that guy.

465
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,850
That, the...

466
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,290
Oh, no way! No way. Dad, no way

467
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,980
She, no, she might be with him. She's afraid of you.

468
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,670
She doesn't want to talk to you.

469
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,910
No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?

470
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,490
Put the phone down. You gotta...

471
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,990
Wait just a minute.

472
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,730
Put the phone down, please.

473
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,450
What are you doing?

474
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,020
Listen, stop.

475
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,010
Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad.

476
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,690
-Give me the phone. Give me the phone. -Pat!

477
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,940
You gotta understand me. You wanna go back?

478
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,500
Well then, stop this! Then don't fucking do this.

479
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,110
Don't talk to me like that.

480
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,210
Well then, don't behave this way.

481
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,460
I got a call asking to check on this house.

482
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,090
Pat Solatano?

483
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,750
Yeah.

484
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,070
Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh.

485
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,210
I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order.

486
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,310
And I heard you went to your old house and the school.

487
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,930
It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case,

488
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,570
so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor.

489
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,570
Respect the restraining order, okay?

490
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,930
-Five hundred feet. -You hear what he just said?

491
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,860
You have a restraining order.

492
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,730
Yeah, Dad, I know.

493
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,460
Thank you, Officer.

494
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,250
If you need anything... my card.

495
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,000
Thank you. Sorry. We understand.

496
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,360
Since when do cops have cards?

497
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,990
Tell me one thing.

498
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,020
Would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail

499
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,700
or to the hospital?

500
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,810
So take your medication and if you do fine,

501
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,220
we'll reduce them.

502
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,220
Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order,

503
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,110
and then she's gonna be with me.

504
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,380
And that's better than any medication.

505
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,570
Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it,

506
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,640
that she may not return.

507
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,390
True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns.

508
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,680
In the meantime, if you listen to that song,

509
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,680
I don't want you to fall apart.

510
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,330
So get a strategy, okay? You need one.

511
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,820
Let me say something, I gotta say something.

512
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,800
Okay.

513
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,580
This is what I believe to be true.

514
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,260
This is what I learned in the hospital.

515
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,840
You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest,

516
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,680
and if you do, if you stay positive,

517
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,020
you have a shot at a silver lining.

518
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,820
Work on a strategy, okay?

519
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,050
Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night

520
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,680
and it's like a real hoity-toity thing

521
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,310
and his wife veronica's a real stickler for...

522
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,410
I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear,

523
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,440
but I wanna wear a jersey

524
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,030
that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.

525
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,250
Which jersey?

526
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,120
DeSean Jackson.

527
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,440
DeSean Jackson is the man.

528
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,360
Well, that settles that.

529
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,690
Pat! What are you doin'?

530
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,930
I gotta go, man.

531
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,800
Why?

532
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,300
I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake,

533
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,100
I shouldn't have worn this.

534
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,670
Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey.

535
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,890
I wish I was wearing that jersey.

536
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,680
Are you comfortable?

537
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,520
Veronica's not gonna like it.

538
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,180
Get over here.

539
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,860
Plus you got a tie on.

540
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,390
Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor.

541
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,700
You come however you wanna come.

542
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,360
Really?

543
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,340
Get over here.

544
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,360
DeSean Jackson's in the house!

545
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,910
You mean rookie of the year?

546
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,800
Yeah.

547
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,150
DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?

548
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,910
Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.

549
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,710
Isn't it awesome?

550
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,910
Not for dinner.

551
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,310
Look, he got us flowers.

552
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,790
Oh, that's sweet. That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.

553
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,500
And wine.

554
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,900
Check this out. We just redid the whole thing.

555
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,290
Tremendous.

556
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:24,970
Isn't it great?

557
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,200
Tremendous.

558
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,770
-Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again. -Why?

559
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,920
-Because. -Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.

560
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,560
Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain.

561
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,310
Isn't the market down, though?

562
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,810
It is down, but you know, she wants more,

563
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,510
so I'm giving her more, man.

564
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,010
Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.

565
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,180
I'm sorry, man.

566
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,500
-A lot of people. My uncle, too. -Really?

567
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,930
Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect,

568
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,180
it's not personal, but this is the time to strike.

569
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,980
You start snapping up commercial real estate, cheap

570
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,160
flip it over, you flip it over and

571
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,080
that's when you make the money.

572
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,000
But the pressure... it's like...

573
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,260
You okay?

574
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,730
I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me.

575
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,640
I feel like I'm getting crushed and...

576
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,470
Crushed by what?

577
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,700
Everything. The family, the baby,

578
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,960
the job, the fucking dicks at work,

579
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,760
and it's like, you know,

580
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,030
like I'm trying to do this, you know, and,

581
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,440
and, and I'm like... suffocating.

582
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,470
Holy shit.

583
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,810
You can't be happy all the time.

584
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,020
Who told you you can't be happy?

585
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,830
It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice.

586
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,760
-That's not true at all. -You just can't.

587
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,540
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

588
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,580
I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over.

589
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,530
-You okay with that? -Who?

590
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,040
Veronica's sister.

591
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,690
Tiffany. Tiffany and Tommy?

592
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,960
Yeah. Just Tiffany.

593
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,940
What happened to Tommy?

594
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,900
He died.

595
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,450
-Tommy died? -Cops die.

596
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,290
How'd he die?

597
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,710
Please, don't bring it up.

598
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,560
No, how did he die?

599
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,870
How did who die?

600
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,500
Tiffany! This is Pat.

601
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,940
Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.

602
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,530
You look nice.

603
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,960
Thank you.

604
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,010
I'm not flirting with you.

605
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,050
Oh, I didn't think you were.

606
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,470
I just see that you made an effort

607
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,710
and I'm gonna be better with my wife,

608
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,820
I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty.

609
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,950
I never used to do that. I do that now.

610
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,050
Cause we're gonna be better than ever... Nikki. Just practicing.

611
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,000
How'd Tommy die?

612
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,500
What about your job?

613
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,890
I just got fired, actually.

614
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,270
Oh, really? How?

615
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,170
I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?

616
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,120
Does it really matter?

617
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,070
Baby, how's it going?

618
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,870
Great, great.

619
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,210
We're gonna go on a tour now.

620
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,340
Let's go see the house.

621
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,580
Come on, let's go for the tour.

622
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,090
I've, I've been planning this forever. I love our house.

623
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,040
I love our house. I'm really excited about it.

624
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,390
Come on.

625
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,520
Guess what it is.

626
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,070
-Oh, it's a television. -Nope.

627
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,100
It's a computer screen.

628
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,950
Just keep going, keep going, keep going.

629
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,430
It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.

630
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,400
It's a light. It's a...

631
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,310
Warmer, warmer, warmer.

632
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,960
It's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies

633
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,890
and shoot them with formaldehyde.

634
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,410
Where would the body go, though?

635
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,590
It's a joke!

636
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,060
It's a fireplace.

637
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,970
In the middle of the wall?

638
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,790
We have a port in every room. Give me an iPod.

639
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,400
Who, who doesn't have an iPod?

640
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,280
Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone.

641
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,410
They won't let me make any calls.

642
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,280
They think I'm gonna call Nikki.

643
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,930
Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that.

644
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,220
I would call Nikki.

645
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,920
I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one.

646
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,900
Give me your iPod.

647
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,910
Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you.

648
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,960
Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in,

649
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,170
I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.

650
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,290
I can play music for the baby in any room.

651
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,160
Can you play Ride the Lightning? By Metallica?

652
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,600
Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany.

653
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,590
Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.

654
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,790
Here's a fun fact. You know where the term OK comes from?

655
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,630
No. No, I don't.

656
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,760
Where?

657
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,430
Well, Martin Van Buren,

658
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,700
the eighth president of the United States of America,

659
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,330
is from Kinderhook, New York

660
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,200
and he was part of a club,

661
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,030
a men's club, called Old Kinderhook.

662
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,940
And if you were cool, you were in the club,

663
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,200
they'd say, that guy's OK.

664
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,170
Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.

665
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,820
-Really? -Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

666
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,540
That's interesting.

667
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,310
You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years

668
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,520
and she's real good at it.

669
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,960
She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.

670
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,430
Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.

671
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,070
Why do you have to talk about me like that?

672
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,640
I'm just bragging about you. Can't I brag about my little sister?

673
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,450
Don't talk about me in the third person.

674
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,950
Please, give me a break.

675
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm right here.

676
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,430
Just be nice. Just be nice.

677
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,450
Fascinating.

678
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,340
Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

679
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,470
I know. I know, I know.

680
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,730
What meds are you on?

681
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,170
Me? None.

682
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,340
I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify,

683
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,950
but I don't take them anymore, no.

684
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,170
They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.

685
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,

686
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,520
but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped.

687
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
You ever take Klonopin?

688
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,040
Klonopin? Yeah.

689
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,990
-Right? -Jesus.

690
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,090
It's like, what? What day is it?

691
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,400
How about Trazodone?

692
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,300
Trazodone!

693
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,990
Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done.

694
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,390
It takes the light right out of your eyes.

695
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,720
God, I bet it does.

696
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,190
I'm tired. I wanna go.

697
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,100
No. No, no, no, no. We haven't,

698
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,420
we haven't even finished the salad yet or the duck.

699
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,360
I made the Fire and Ice cake.

700
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,140
I said I'm tired. Are you gonna walk me home or what?

701
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,950
You mean me?

702
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,170
Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?

703
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,940
You have poor social skills. You have a problem.

704
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,490
I have a problem?

705
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,530
You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things.

706
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,680
You scare people.

707
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,980
I tell the truth. But you're mean.

708
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,670
What? I'm not telling the truth?

709
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?

710
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,320
You can drive them both home. Now.

711
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,210
Stop talking about me in third person.

712
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,510
You can take Tiffany home first.

713
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,980
You love it when I have problems.

714
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,830
You love it, Von,

715
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,860
because then you can be the good one. Just say it.

716
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,120
No... I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice,

717
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,660
I just wanted to have a nice dinner. Oh, God.

718
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,300
What is your problem?!

719
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,300
Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go.

720
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,180
Come on, are you ready?

721
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,170
You really, you really wanna go right now?

722
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,940
Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.

723
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,060
Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!

724
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,250
Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.

725
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,250
Sorry, man.

726
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,630
Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage

727
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,380
so I don't really remember how this works.

728
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,600
How what works?

729
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,330
I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat.

730
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,640
You felt it, I felt it, don't lie.

731
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,130
We're not liars like they are.

732
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,630
I live in the addition around back,

733
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,950
which is completely separate from my parents' house,

734
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,030
so there's no chance of them walking in on us.

735
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,400
I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner

736
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,540
because I hate football,

737
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,860
but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?

738
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,260
How old are you?

739
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,990
Old enough to have a marriage end

740
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,320
and not wind up in a mental hospital.

741
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,870
Look, I had a really good time tonight

742
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,860
and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?

743
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,260
You're married? So am I.

744
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,700
No, that's confusing. He's dead.

745
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,950
Wait, what?

746
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,720
What's happening?

747
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,680
Oh, my God.

748
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,690
Are you okay? Ronnie called.

749
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,940
Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?

750
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:20,990
I don't know, Mom.

751
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,180
What happened over there?

752
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,530
When am I gonna get a phone?

753
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,890
You'll get a phone in due time.

754
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,710
What happened?

755
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,540
Pat!

756
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,080
Mom!

757
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,090
I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up.

758
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:54,590
What is it?

759
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,100
Where's my wedding video?

760
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,370
It's after three o'clock! What are you doing?

761
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,970
I looked in here, but this is all your shit up here,

762
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,120
for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?

763
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,500
What about in your father's study?

764
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,410
Don't go in my study.

765
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,010
Dad, not now!

766
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,860
Would you put it in here?

767
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,080
It makes no sense for you to put it in here.

768
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,120
Patty, what are you doing?

769
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,050
He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!

770
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,950
Is it here?

771
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,600
Patty!

772
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,930
It's probably in the attic.

773
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,430
Are you going in my study?

774
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,050
It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.

775
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,250
Please stop yelling!

776
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,180
I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated

777
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,860
because I should have my fucking wedding video!

778
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,560
Pat! Pat!

779
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,890
I looked over there! I already looked all over there!

780
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,940
Calm down, Pat.

781
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,550
I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears,

782
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,360
I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up!

783
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,790
I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it!

784
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,280
Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I don't care!

785
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,350
Pat! Stop it!

786
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,210
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

787
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,100
What's going on?

788
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,800
I want it!

789
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,940
It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!

790
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,920
Pat! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

791
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,210
I can't watch my wedding video, but I can hear the fucking song

792
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,900
Mom?

793
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,380
What the fuck you doing?! You hit your mother?!

794
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,570
No, no, no, no, no!

795
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,570
Stop it!

796
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,750
Get off me, Dad!

797
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,310
Stop hitting him!

798
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,970
Stop hitting him!

799
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,400
I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!

800
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,980
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

801
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,330
Police! Open up.

802
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,470
Mister Solatano, I got a lot of calls.

803
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,280
People in the neighborhood are scared. I gotta come in.

804
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,830
How are we doing in here?

805
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,350
There are a lot of reports from your neighbors,

806
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,850
we got a lot of phone calls.

807
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,620
Nikki is being manipulated and controlled.

808
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,630
You have to talk to her.

809
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,430
Hey, sit down.

810
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,200
Sit down.

811
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,140
You gotta stop with these crazy theories.

812
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,310
He's a cop. What are you doing?

813
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,270
It's a medication problem, but he's fine now.

814
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,710
Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore?

815
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,050
We know all about the explosion at the psychiatrist's office.

816
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,580
What?

817
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,030
What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true.

818
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,250
He's not allowed to talk about that.

819
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,560
Jesus Christ, who's that?

820
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,360
Keep an eye on him.

821
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,690
Is this a bipolar episode?

822
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,870
Get outta here, you little fuckin' idiot!

823
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,510
-Get outta here! -Someone, help me! Help me!

824
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,130
You can't tell Nikki about this, officer.

825
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,160
Look, I gotta make out a report.

826
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,110
No, no, no, listen, sir.

827
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,360
Sit down.

828
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,710
He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me! Help me!

829
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,750
Sit down!

830
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,650
I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter

831
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,690
and you could just let me have five minutes,

832
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,830
explaining how much better I'm doing.

833
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,890
There's a court order against you, five hundred feet.

834
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,860
Listen to me!

835
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,830
And I'll take that fucking camera

836
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,630
and I'm gonna break it over your fuckin' head,

837
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,520
then I'm gonna come back and interview you about

838
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,150
what it's like to get that fuckin' camera broken over your head!

839
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,510
You... what are you laughing about?

840
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,140
I'm sorry.

841
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,120
I'm sorry.

842
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,340
Go back to sleep. The party's over. Show's over.

843
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,890
This is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't... please,

844
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,470
you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.

845
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,140
You need to pipe down.

846
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,950
Everything all right?

847
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,090
Who was at the door?

848
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,040
Who was that, Dad?

849
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,340
It was that kid with the camera.

850
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,500
Good luck. I gotta write this up.

851
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,810
Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this!

852
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,550
It's okay, everything is okay. We're fine, thank you,

853
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,880
we appreciate it. Thank you.

854
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,930
What the hell?

855
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,820
What happened to your face?

856
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:16,730
Weight lifting accident.

857
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,350
That sounds like bullshit.

858
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,270
Why'd you run by my house?

859
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,870
Did our little conversation get you upset last night?

860
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,700
Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.

861
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,750
This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.

862
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,800
I like to run by myself, okay?

863
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,820
Me too.

864
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,680
Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?

865
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,610
What?

866
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,450
-I'm running here! -Me too!

867
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,080
Well then, why don't you run somewhere else?

868
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,200
There's a fucking ton of roads to run in!

869
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,770
What are you trying to do?

870
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,600
I like this road. This is my neighborhood.

871
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,510
Oh, come on, please!

872
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,540
Calm down, crazy.

873
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,720
What the fuck?!

874
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,350
I'm married!

875
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,560
So am I!

876
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,560
What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!

877
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,010
Where is your wife?

878
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,910
You're crazy!

879
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,350
I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.

880
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,470
I'm not the big slut!

881
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

882
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,870
I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore.

883
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,580
There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty,

884
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,470
but I like that,

885
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,920
with all the other parts of myself.

886
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,250
Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?!

887
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,240
Can you forgive? Are you any good at that?

888
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,820
You seemed to have trouble last night.

889
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,620
Let me just set the record straight about last night.

890
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,600
Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it,

891
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,790
and I hate my illness and I want to control it.

892
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,050
My father, on the other hand,

893
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,880
had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night,

894
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,340
which I did not return

895
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,910
Cause I could've killed him and I didn't.

896
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,010
He's sixty-five years old.

897
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,230
You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean...

898
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,750
He was scared for your mother

899
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,820
and you hurt him as well.

900
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,550
Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?

901
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,290
And I think he probably just tried to do his best.

902
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,150
Pat, you have to have a strategy.

903
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,120
I told you earlier.

904
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,480
You need to recognize these feelings coming to you,

905
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,570
otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore.

906
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,960
So when you get these feelings,

907
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
you need to get to a quieter place,

908
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,850
and be at peace with yourself, however you can.

909
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,620
Yeah, but that's easier said than done.

910
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,990
You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.

911
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,320
Yeah, Excelsior. Listen,

912
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,060
I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, Okay?

913
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,410
No.

914
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,310
Why?

915
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,150
Because you have a restraining order.

916
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,300
What good are you, man?

917
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,750
Why did you have this overwhelming urgency

918
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,070
to see your wedding video last night?

919
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,320
Oh, I don't know, because I'm married

920
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,820
and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?

921
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,370
Maybe you think that Nikki's not around

922
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,120
and Tiffany's an attractive girl

923
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,580
and if you get drawn towards Tiffany,

924
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,710
you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?

925
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,160
Not bad, Doctor Jones.

926
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,390
But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki

927
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,710
because Tiffany's a slut.

928
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,210
Why is she a slut?

929
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
After the dinner at Ronnie's,

930
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,460
she said, quote, "We can go to the back house

931
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,450
and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out."

932
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,330
Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring.

933
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,700
So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

934
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,590
Maybe she just needs a friend

935
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,260
and she thought if she offers you sex,

936
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,440
it will be easier for you to become friends with her.

937
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,930
She said she's not a whore anymore,

938
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,910
but she likes that part of herself

939
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,640
along with all the other parts of herself

940
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,100
and can I say the same?

941
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,670
Can you?

942
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,220
Is that...? You're asking that,

943
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,670
you're really asking me that question?

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,490
Yes.

945
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,660
With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?

946
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,610
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.

947
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,880
I'm just giving back your words to you.

948
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,020
This "Crazy sad shit," as you call it,

949
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,760
made you a happier, calmer person

950
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,660
with a beautiful positive philosophy of

951
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,470
going outdoors, working out, and reading books.

952
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,850
No, not the books.

953
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,190
You said Nikki's friends with Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany.

954
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,910
So if you become friends with Tiffany,

955
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,390
Nikki will think that

956
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,660
you're a kind, generous, large-hearted person,

957
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,820
who helps people in need,

958
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,570
who is basically thriving.

959
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,490
So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.

960
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,340
How do you know when I run?

961
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
I wanted to clarify something.

962
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,290
I just want us to be friends.

963
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,700
Did you hear what I said?

964
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,810
Why are you giving me such a hard time?

965
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,520
No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

966
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.

967
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,990
You wanna have dinner at this diner?

968
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,700
Pick me up at seven thirty.

969
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,700
Happy Halloween.

970
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,920
Here you go.

971
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,900
Thank you.

972
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,860
I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.

973
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,570
Great!

974
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,880
Tea.

975
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,690
Be right back.

976
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,700
You look nice.

977
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:38,940
Thanks.

978
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,270
Raisin Bran. Milk.

979
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,510
Thank you.

980
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,820
You want to share this?

981
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,390
Why did you order Raisin Bran?

982
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,370
Why did you order tea?

983
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,840
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

984
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,100
I ordered Raisin Bran

985
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,150
because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.

986
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,120
It can still be a date

987
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,200
if you order Raisin Bran.

988
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,160
It's not a date.

989
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,390
So how's your thing going, your dancing thing?

990
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,270
It's good. How's your restraining order?

991
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,960
I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing",

992
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,210
but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well.

993
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,240
Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.

994
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,890
And the so-called incident with the weights.

995
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,850
Yeah. That was a thing with my parents.

996
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,210
I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki

997
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,910
because it was minor

998
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,910
and I could just explain it and let her know

999
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,350
that I'm actually not out of control

1000
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,470
and that I'm actually doing really well.

1001
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,600
I can get a letter to Nikki.

1002
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,750
I see her sometimes with my sister.

1003
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,410
It would be so amazing

1004
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,190
if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.

1005
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,010
I'd have to hide it from Veronica.

1006
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,600
She's not into breaking the law,

1007
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,100
which this letter would definitely be doing.

1008
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,690
But you would do it?

1009
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,390
I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family,

1010
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,910
you should hear how I lost my job.

1011
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,800
How did you lose your job?

1012
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,520
By...

1013
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,160
having sex with everybody in the office.

1014
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,360
Everybody?

1015
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,950
I was very depressed after Tommy died.

1016
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,950
It was a lot of people.

1017
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,910
We don't have to talk about it.

1018
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,750
Thanks.

1019
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,960
How many were there?

1020
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,710
Eleven.

1021
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,260
-Wow. -I know.

1022
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,720
-I'm not gonna talk about it anymore. -Okay.

1023
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,080
Can I ask you one more question?

1024
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,560
-Were there any women? -Yes.

1025
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,530
-Really? -Yes.

1026
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,560
-What was that like? -Hot.

1027
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,170
Jesus Christ.

1028
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,170
Was it like... older women,

1029
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,360
a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you...

1030
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,580
Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.

1031
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,550
What? You sat on her lap?

1032
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,530
Mm-hmm.

1033
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,690
-She told you what to do? -Mm-hmm.

1034
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,710
Oh... my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this.

1035
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,480
Made me feel like such a pervert.

1036
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,210
-Maybe we should change the subject. -I don't mind it.

1037
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,770
You don't, do you?

1038
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,900
No.

1039
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,020
But then people were getting into fights

1040
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,910
in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...

1041
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,440
and the boss called me in to his office and

1042
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,800
tried to pin it all on me.

1043
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,180
So I accused him of harassment

1044
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,860
and then they fired me, sent me home

1045
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,590
and put me on some meds.

1046
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:21,860
I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...

1047
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,710
was in the shower with the history teacher...

1048
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,910
I heard about that.

1049
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,320
It was my wedding song

1050
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,840
and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy.

1051
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,600
Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.

1052
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,840
Wow.

1053
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,980
Yeah. So they put me on medication,

1054
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,570
which I feel ashamed of.

1055
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,200
-Yeah. -So I know.

1056
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,700
You do.

1057
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,390
-I just gotta get a strategy, you know? -Me too.

1058
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,160
We'd better get back to the letter.

1059
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,570
Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

1060
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,070
What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?

1061
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,310
Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.

1062
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,750
Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.

1063
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,810
Can I at least finish my tea?

1064
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:05,900
Wait, what?

1065
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,280
My tea. Can I finish it?

1066
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,040
Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner?

1067
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,220
Why would she do that? Was it a test?

1068
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,490
I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

1069
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,560
Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do?

1070
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,690
I think I did pretty well.

1071
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,390
Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.

1072
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,630
Basically? Was I some percentage not cool?

1073
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,430
No, she said you were cool, but you know.

1074
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,770
No, I don't know.

1075
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,910
Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.

1076
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,190
What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?

1077
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,720
Sort of like me.

1078
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,690
"Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.

1079
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,780
-Why? -Because, it's just not right,

1080
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,160
lumping you and I together,

1081
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,700
I mean, it's just wrong.

1082
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,470
And Nikki wouldn't like that.

1083
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,820
Especially after all the shit you just told me.

1084
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,790
You think that I'm crazier than you.

1085
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,680
Because...

1086
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,560
well, we're different, I mean...

1087
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,870
Oh, my God.

1088
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,620
Ugh. You're killing me.

1089
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,880
You know what? Forget I offered to help you.

1090
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,630
Forget the entire fucking idea.

1091
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,400
Cause that must have been fucking crazy

1092
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,460
because I am so much crazier than you.

1093
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:38,510
Keep your voice down.

1094
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,680
I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!

1095
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,920
Forget it!

1096
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,740
-Shut the fuck up. -Fuck you!

1097
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,620
You shut the fuck up!

1098
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:49,630
Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!

1099
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,000
Slow down, Raisin Bran.

1100
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,400
Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?

1101
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,910
-Yes, you do. -No, I don't.

1102
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,130
You told your therapist

1103
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,100
that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?

1104
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,460
What? Hey, calm down! Hey...

1105
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,280
Just leave me alone!

1106
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,130
Can I just explain myself, please?

1107
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,950
I didn't want Nikki to think that

1108
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,020
I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior

1109
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,160
because I've never done anything like that, okay?

1110
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,090
You may not have experienced the shit that I did.

1111
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,340
But you loved hearing about it, didn't you?

1112
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,630
You are afraid to be alive,

1113
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,330
you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.

1114
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:36,030
You're a conformist. You're a liar.

1115
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,350
I opened up to you and you judged me.

1116
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,960
You are an asshole. You are an asshole!

1117
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,140
Get off of me! Get off!

1118
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,240
You're harassing me!

1119
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:49,620
He's harassing me! Get off!

1120
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,000
Take it easy. Dude, relax.

1121
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,910
He's harassing me!

1122
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,930
Bro, get off of me.

1123
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,010
He's harassing me!

1124
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,110
Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right?

1125
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,580
Hey, get off of me!

1126
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,320
Shut up, shut up.

1127
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,340
Stop it.

1128
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,160
Hey, hey, hey, get off me!

1129
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,060
What are you doing? Come on. What are you doing?

1130
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,020
What are you doing to these kids?

1131
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,330
Are you being a punk on Halloween with these kids?

1132
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,030
You wanna go back to Baltimore? Is that what you wanna do?

1133
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,810
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't...

1134
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,600
Come on, Solitano.

1135
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,900
What are these kids doing here?

1136
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,460
They're gonna get you back to Baltimore.

1137
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,920
You know that, right? What's the matter with you, huh?

1138
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,320
You know you're just sick.

1139
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,360
It's the kids! It's the kids!

1140
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,880
Honestly He didn't do anything, it was all the kids.

1141
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,380
They started it. He didn't do anything.

1142
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,390
Come on, man. Come here.

1143
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,660
What you gonna do about that song?

1144
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,520
You gonna go your whole life scared of that song?

1145
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,090
It's just a song. Don't make it a monster.

1146
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,270
Come on breath! There's no song. There's no song.

1147
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,270
There's no song playing.

1148
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,630
That's it.

1149
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,910
That's it. There you go.

1150
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,310
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.

1151
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,220
I took it too far.

1152
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:15,730
Hey, is he messing with you?

1153
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,290
No, no. No, this was just a joke.

1154
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,560
This is a joke I started.

1155
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,610
There's a restraining order on this guy.

1156
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,900
I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.

1157
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:22,800
That's not a good thing to do.

1158
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,980
Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.

1159
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,320
You're Tommy's widow, right?

1160
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,970
Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow,

1161
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,140
minus the whore thing for the most part.

1162
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,480
You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime?

1163
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,370
-What'd I say? -She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.

1164
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,970
I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.

1165
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,480
I know. I know you didn't mean it.

1166
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,860
I didn't mean it at all.

1167
00:51:59,220 --> 00:51:59,880
I know, you say shit

1168
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,760
you don't mean all the time.

1169
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,700
All the time.

1170
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,350
I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry.

1171
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,080
Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.

1172
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,150
I know you do.

1173
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:14,010
-You do? -Yeah, sure.

1174
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:18,670
I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?

1175
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,230
I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing.

1176
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,360
Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope

1177
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,610
and one of them took it.

1178
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,550
-That's the only answer. -No, no, no.

1179
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,170
Dolores, somebody was in my study.

1180
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,490
Who took one of my envelopes?

1181
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:36,570
Somebody took an envelope.

1182
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,920
Maybe we should call the FBI.

1183
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,270
Don't make fun. This is serious.

1184
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,770
What FBI? Come on, let's take a look.

1185
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,000
I'll show you what this is.

1186
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,130
I'm gonna just explain to you something.

1187
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,820
I mean, you know what I'm doing, honey.

1188
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,010
This everything, like this.

1189
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,460
I got this, it all corresponds.

1190
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,630
Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes.

1191
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,060
I hope that's not a problem.

1192
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,020
No, it's not okay. It's not okay. You gotta ask.

1193
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,740
Do not go in my study

1194
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,900
or I will eat you!?

1195
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,160
It's not funny, it's not funny.

1196
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,700
What's everybody making a joke out of this for?

1197
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,550
Dolores, you are so beautiful!

1198
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,580
Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!

1199
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,160
Listen, a lot of envelopes go in

1200
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,310
and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in.

1201
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,000
So show some respect for what I do.

1202
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,520
Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four.

1203
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,480
I just wanted to tell you the number.

1204
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,190
Thank you.

1205
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,000
But the envelope was empty.

1206
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,180
I'm sorry, you were sleeping.

1207
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,350
I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope.

1208
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,680
You didn't want to wake me? He didn't want to wake me.

1209
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,200
He doesn't have a problem

1210
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,300
complaining about Ernest fucking Hemingway.

1211
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,460
He doesn't have a problem

1212
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,310
-asking for his wedding video... -Be nice.

1213
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,310
It's game day! I'm makin crabby snacks and homemades.

1214
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,750
Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice.

1215
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,360
Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades. Come on, Dad!

1216
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,100
What are you so up about?

1217
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,550
-He's very happy. -I'm happy.

1218
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:41,740
No, you're so up, up, up, up.

1219
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,710
Isn't that a good thing?

1220
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,450
You're just up, up, up. I don't know what that is.

1221
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,770
Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication?

1222
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,740
Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am.

1223
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,520
Okay. Taking a little bit too many or something?

1224
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,980
No, if I was taking that,

1225
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,980
I'd be on the floor, Dad.

1226
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,060
Just stay with us. Stay for the game.

1227
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,880
Spend some family time.

1228
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,560
Dad, I can't. Look,

1229
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,360
I'm ready to go. What do you mean?

1230
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,150
Spend family time.

1231
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,930
Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?

1232
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,240
Come on, your dad needs a winner. Help him out.

1233
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,270
-Come on. -I can't.

1234
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,850
It's the Seahawks. Put on the jersey and stay,

1235
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,950
please. Please. It's important, please.

1236
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,540
-What are you up to, Pat? -Nothing, come on.

1237
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,580
What's in the envelope?

1238
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,950
Yeah, what are you doing? What's in that envelope?

1239
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,230
Guys, I'm beating the song!

1240
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,850
I'm on the scoreboard!

1241
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,310
I'm playing down field! I feel great!

1242
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:30,810
Tiffany.

1243
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,580
Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?

1244
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,970
What do you want with her?

1245
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,830
Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.

1246
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,480
Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.

1247
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,990
Oh, great, a married creep.

1248
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:51,460
I'm her friend. We go running.

1249
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,240
Have you guys not seen us?

1250
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,190
I took her to the diner.

1251
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,990
She's not here.

1252
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,240
Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home?

1253
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,220
Go away.

1254
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,900
I know her.

1255
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,870
-I know her, we've dated. -What are you doing here?

1256
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,250
We still date.

1257
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,400
I've called her, I've texted her.

1258
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,750
You know this guy?

1259
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,930
I still haven't heard back.

1260
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,470
-We used to work together... -Just get the hell out of here.

1261
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,290
I just wanted to give you my card to give to her.

1262
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,810
-Another rude creep. -Listen to what he's saying.

1263
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,930
-Listen to what he's saying. -What's he saying?

1264
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,810
He's saying you're being rude.

1265
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,280
How am I being rude?

1266
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,650
Oh, you know. You know. Come on.

1267
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,420
Sometimes it's okay with girls like this,

1268
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,520
they wanna have fun

1269
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,540
and sometimes it's not

1270
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,360
because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt,

1271
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,910
and they're an easy target.

1272
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,320
And in this case, in this particular case,

1273
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,310
I think that wing is being fixed, my friend.

1274
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,520
And you gotta make sure it gets mended.

1275
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,770
And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay?

1276
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,730
Because she's sensitive and she's smart,

1277
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,700
she's artistic. This is a great girl

1278
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,120
and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on.

1279
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,500
Let me walk you down to your car.

1280
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,710
You're a better guy than this.

1281
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,340
-I can see it in your eyes. -She just texted me!

1282
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,600
Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened?

1283
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,530
How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?

1284
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,190
I can't, I can't do it.

1285
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,250
What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?

1286
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,980
I can't give the letter to Nikki.

1287
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,350
Tiffany, what are you talking about?

1288
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,820
What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?

1289
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,290
Because what am I getting in return?

1290
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,590
What are you doing for me?

1291
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,340
You said! You said if I wrote a letter,

1292
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,590
-you'd get it to Nikki. -I know.

1293
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,110
That was the set-up.

1294
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,670
Because I do this time after time after time,

1295
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,110
I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and,

1296
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,300
and I'm empty, I have nothing!

1297
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,450
What are you talking about?

1298
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,110
You seem like you're a tough girl to me.

1299
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,030
Why don't you just do things on your own?

1300
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,050
I always get myself in these fucking situations.

1301
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,960
I give everything to other people and nobody ever...

1302
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,890
I never... I don't get what I want, okay?

1303
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,270
I'm not my sister.

1304
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,420
Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?

1305
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:43,680
-I can't do it. -Tiffany, what do you want me to do?

1306
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,700
-Think of something. -There's this thing.

1307
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,010
There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?

1308
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,420
It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.

1309
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,310
It's a dance thing, all right.

1310
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:57,880
It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel.

1311
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,030
-Tommy would never do it with me -Well, Tommy's dead

1312
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,050
-so he's not gonna fucking do it. -And I missed it every single year.

1313
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,700
-Would you please! -I don't have a filter when I talk.

1314
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,610
Can we have one conversation without you reminding me

1315
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:06,770
that my goddamn husband is dead?

1316
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,600
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

1317
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,560
Oh, my God!

1318
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,850
But I can only do it if I have a partner...

1319
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,080
and now I'm about to miss it for another year.

1320
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you.

1321
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:16,640
What are you talking about?

1322
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,940
What, your big schedule is so busy?

1323
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,030
Grapes of Wrath?

1324
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:21,010
And watching football with your dad?

1325
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,540
Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.

1326
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,770
All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.

1327
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,940
Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.

1328
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,280
Think about it.

1329
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,040
Well, I already did do something for you, you know.

1330
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,040
What did you do for me?

1331
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,990
I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.

1332
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,020
What? Jordie?

1333
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,110
Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely?

1334
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,370
That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.

1335
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,970
Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?

1336
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,270
It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about?

1337
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,260
We're in love and we're married.

1338
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:48,310
It's completely different.

1339
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,490
How are you in love?

1340
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,340
Tell me about that. The big Nikki love.

1341
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,340
Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.

1342
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,450
We have a very unconventional chemistry,

1343
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,940
it makes people feel awkward, but not me.

1344
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,190
She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.

1345
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,590
-Wow. -It's electric between us,

1346
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,280
Okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other,

1347
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,810
but that's normal, couples wanna do that,

1348
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:11,870
I want her to stop dressing like she dresses,

1349
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,670
I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay?

1350
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,310
And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings,

1351
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,760
of which both I've done.

1352
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,010
I mean, people fight. Couples fight.

1353
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,000
We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks.

1354
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,380
That's normal. She always wanted the best for me.

1355
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,330
She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate.

1356
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,440
And that's a good thing, you knwo?

1357
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,710
That's a good thing. You know?

1358
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,550
I just, look, I'm my best self today,

1359
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,920
and I think she's her best self today,

1360
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,670
and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.

1361
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,620
It's gonna be amazing,

1362
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,590
and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing,

1363
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,110
and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take

1364
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,010
advantage of a situation without offering to do something back.

1365
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,640
So think about the dance thing.

1366
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,110
Danny, you're out of the hospital?

1367
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,120
And you're here on game day?

1368
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,420
I'm out. It's official, man. They didn't convert me to

1369
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,410
my Mental Hygiene Law admission status

1370
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:03,160
within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence,

1371
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,270
so I'm out. They had to let me go.

1372
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,070
I never understand what he's saying.

1373
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,360
Okay, jailhouse lawyer, come on,

1374
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,260
let's come back and sit down the way you were before.

1375
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,350
What a treat! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here?

1376
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,110
He calls me kailhouse Lawyer?

1377
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,410
Hold the remote the way you were holding it before.

1378
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,740
And now you're holding the remote?

1379
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,740
And it's working. Your dad's a genius.

1380
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,950
Now sit up.

1381
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,050
And Danny's the good luck charm?

1382
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,400
Danny's from you. This is your house,

1383
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,380
so it comes down to you.

1384
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,230
-You're the one. -Yeah, you're the one, Pat.

1385
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:32,760
Superstition, Danny. I don't know.

1386
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,540
Come sit down.

1387
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,930
Don't disappear doing God knows what with that Tiffany Maxwell.

1388
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,980
Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend.

1389
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:39,870
Why would you say that?

1390
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,110
Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful.

1391
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,140
She goes to a lot of therapy.

1392
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,150
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.

1393
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:45,690
What are you trying to say?

1394
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,190
-I'm just saying... -Am I messed up?

1395
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,180
Why don't you stop judging people?

1396
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:49,890
You judge everybody.

1397
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,340
You're the one who has a messed up marriage.

1398
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,230
I'm just looking out for you,

1399
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,060
I'm just looking out... She's unstable.

1400
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,490
-What's wrong with your marriage? -Nothing's wrong!

1401
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,580
You should have seen when I was at his house.

1402
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,600
It's like a circus over there.

1403
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,820
-What are you talking about? -I'm not gonna hide this.

1404
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,720
-You need to deal with it. -Stop breaking my balls.

1405
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,060
I got you an iPod.

1406
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,230
Whoa! Is this for me?

1407
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,920
Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but-

1408
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,880
Oh, buddy, thank you. That's so nice of you.

1409
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,060
Thirty-two gigabytes.

1410
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,120
-How many songs is that? -Seven thousand.

1411
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,380
Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers. You love The Stranglers.

1412
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,200
Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.

1413
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,840
Got some Clash.

1414
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,700
Oh, West Side Story.

1415
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,310
West Side Story. It makes me peaceful.

1416
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,330
Maria, I just met a girl named Maria...

1417
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:28,250
And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days,

1418
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,770
I go to the Garage... Metallica... Megadeth.

1419
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,820
I start fucking smashing shit.

1420
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,480
You gotta get your marriage together.

1421
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,010
I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand. And I...

1422
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,780
Ronnie, that's fucked up.

1423
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,920
Yeah, but it makes me feel better.

1424
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,830
It's like my therapy, you know?

1425
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,240
When I'm with Nikki,

1426
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,970
I'm never gonna do stuff like that...

1427
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:54,740
Whoa, Nikki? What's all this about Nikki?

1428
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,980
A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro.

1429
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,480
Holy shit, look at you! You are fit!

1430
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,850
You look absolutely amazing. You feel good?

1431
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,060
-How you doing, Jake? -Good.

1432
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,830
You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.

1433
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,790
Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?

1434
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,400
So, listen, I'm sorry that

1435
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,420
I didn't come see you down at the hospital.

1436
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,370
You know how those places creep me out,

1437
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,210
and the firm's been expanding.

1438
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,430
I've been helping Papa with the restaurant

1439
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:23,210
because he needs to have a legitimate business.

1440
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,330
He needs a tax return.

1441
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,010
With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking,

1442
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:26,930
they're gonna come after him.

1443
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,290
And then it looks like I'm making,

1444
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,630
I'm gonna make partner at the firm.

1445
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,420
Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore.

1446
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:34,950
You lost your wife,

1447
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,210
I'm getting engaged,

1448
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,570
and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things.

1449
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,540
You lost your house,

1450
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,750
I'm getting a new house.

1451
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,810
You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm.

1452
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,990
Maybe stop talking about all the stuff

1453
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:51,700
that's good for you and bad for him.

1454
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,700
Just, you know, leave it alone. We're watching the game.

1455
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,920
You know what, I'm just gonna,

1456
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,030
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking.

1457
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:59,510
I'm gonna shut my mouth.

1458
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:06,780
As my friend Danny would say

1459
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,290
I got nothing but love for you, brother.

1460
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,940
That's right. That's right. That's nice. That's nice.

1461
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:24,620
Well, thank God, finally.

1462
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,490
-DeSean Jackson. -Yeah. Did it fit?

1463
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,470
I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.

1464
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,100
Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.

1465
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,590
Veronica didn't like it.

1466
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,870
Veronica hates the jersey.

1467
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,330
Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay?

1468
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,230
Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.

1469
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,780
Pat, you're up to something, I know.

1470
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,640
People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me,

1471
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,040
maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay?

1472
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,110
Did you ever think about that?

1473
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,550
Maybe we understand something because we're more-

1474
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,420
We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it.

1475
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:52,340
Everybody's just not in touch with it.

1476
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,950
-How you doing, Pat? -Jesus.

1477
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,280
I guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming.

1478
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,670
I'm taking him back to the hospital.

1479
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,100
Why? No, no, he passed his thing, right?

1480
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,890
First of all, check with the latest legal development.

1481
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,700
Well, we got a call that

1482
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,660
they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law

1483
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,860
admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so...

1484
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,010
Wait a minute.

1485
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:14,140
Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan?

1486
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,510
I'm an Eagles fan.

1487
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,960
Well then, what's the problem?

1488
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,680
He's not goin' anywhere.

1489
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,770
Just let him finish the game, that's all.

1490
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:20,720
The handkerchief is working.

1491
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,160
We're killing the Seahawks, twenty-seventen.

1492
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,300
What's the matter with you? Let him stay, please!

1493
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,220
I don't know what the hell you're talking about the handkerchief?

1494
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:31,450
And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning,

1495
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,210
but I gotta take Danny McDaniels

1496
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,870
back to Baltimore, alright?

1497
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,900
He can contest his case from Baltimore.

1498
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,030
Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct.

1499
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,840
You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

1500
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,180
I used the insurance money to build this.

1501
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:05,100
I designed it.

1502
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,430
All the floors are hard oak.

1503
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,760
It has good bounce for dancers.

1504
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:11,260
I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares?

1505
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,540
It's therapy and it's fun.

1506
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,690
And the walls are good

1507
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,010
because I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.

1508
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:18,310
Where you sleep?

1509
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,910
Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it.

1510
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,420
You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.

1511
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,290
When are you gonna give it to her?

1512
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:27,850
What?

1513
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,230
The letter to Nikki.

1514
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,710
Probably tonight.

1515
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,490
Really?

1516
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,890
Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.

1517
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,070
Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph.

1518
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,350
I did this thing about shakespeare and

1519
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,260
how it's very romantic-

1520
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,170
and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing,

1521
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,600
I can be able to do that because of all the training that-

1522
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,460
No, that's good, that's really good.

1523
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:47,810
I assume you're a good teacher.

1524
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,840
Yeah. I mean, I hope so.

1525
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:49,870
Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?

1526
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,800
And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.

1527
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,600
Yeah. It's really generous.

1528
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,750
You know, being of service.

1529
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,350
Yeah. To your need.

1530
01:04:58,670 --> 01:04:59,910
All right, let's start simple.

1531
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:02,010
Start at that corner, walk towards me.

1532
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,510
Walk across the room.

1533
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,600
Can we do something else besides the dance deal?

1534
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,480
Are you fucking kidding me?

1535
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,420
I'm good with a hammer.

1536
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,360
You want me to fix something?

1537
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,150
A deal is a deal.

1538
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,790
I know. Okay. I was just suggesting

1539
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,270
that maybe there's a better scenario.

1540
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,720
Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki.

1541
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,920
And the only way to convey how much you've missed me

1542
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,300
is by your walk. By your slow walk.

1543
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,170
You can't talk. Only walk.

1544
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,410
-I'm not doing it. -Do it.

1545
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,910
No. That's stupid.

1546
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,420
No walk, no letter.

1547
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,710
Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on.

1548
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,260
Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.

1549
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,310
You're not Nikki.

1550
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,010
Don't look up until you're halfway here.

1551
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,470
That's right. Not yet.

1552
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,580
Do you feel that? That's emotion.

1553
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,320
I don't feel anything.

1554
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,450
Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?

1555
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:11,720
No.

1556
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,230
We were married for three years and five days,

1557
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,320
and I loved him.

1558
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,930
But for the last couple months,

1559
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,930
I just wasn't into sex at all.

1560
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:24,160
It just felt like we were so different

1561
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,320
and I was depressed.

1562
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,580
Some of that is just me,

1563
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,810
some of it was he wanted me to have kids

1564
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,940
and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself.

1565
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,110
I don't think that makes me a criminal.

1566
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,400
Anyway one night after dinner,

1567
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,540
he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall

1568
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,880
and got some lingerie to get something going.

1569
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:50,800
And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy

1570
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,840
with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed.

1571
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,670
And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat.

1572
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,250
That's a feeling.

1573
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:54,780
-Whoa! Slow down. -What?

1574
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,770
Your father wanted you to have this.

1575
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,450
He wants me to have-all this Eagles information.

1576
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,730
-It's his living. -Um, tell Dad thanks.

1577
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,440
Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.

1578
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,870
Football stays out of this place, so does Lord of the Flies.

1579
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,820
Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing?

1580
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:20,740
I'm behind on my syllabus.

1581
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,600
-I don't give a fuck. -What the hell are you doing?

1582
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,560
Did you just throw that outside?

1583
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,890
What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time.

1584
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,090
I can tell you all about the Lord of the Flies.

1585
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:34,650
It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch

1586
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:36,480
they have a shell, and whoever has the conch

1587
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,640
he has the power and they can talk.

1588
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,960
And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power.

1589
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,830
And then there's a little chubby boy,

1590
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:42,940
and they call him Piggy

1591
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,920
and they're really mean,

1592
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,030
and then there's a murder.

1593
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:48,850
I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.

1594
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,680
Wow. That was a great synopsis.

1595
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,170
I still need to read it, though.

1596
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:54,550
Who's that?

1597
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:58,240
Hello? What the...? What are you doing here, man?

1598
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:00,710
If one of your two supervising physicians

1599
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,260
loses their license,

1600
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,490
then your whole ajudication is thrown out.

1601
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,310
How'd you know we were here?

1602
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,380
I went by your parents' house looking for you

1603
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:08,080
and they told me you was over here.

1604
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,790
Danny, this is Tiffany.

1605
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:09,420
Tiffany, this is Danny.

1606
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,660
Hello. Pat told me about you.

1607
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,760
So is this the girl, that you wrote about?

1608
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,860
What? He wrote about me? I'm the girl?

1609
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,350
-He wrote about you, all right. -What'd he say?

1610
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,890
He said you guys was helping each other out

1611
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,790
and you were nice and you...

1612
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,020
you had a mouth on you, but-

1613
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,060
Whoa, whoa, that's enough.

1614
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:26,780
you were mouthy,

1615
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,270
No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.

1616
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:28,880
Yeah, anything you wanna know,

1617
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,330
I'll just tell you. It was nothing.

1618
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,490
It was just a very general letter.

1619
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,220
Cool.

1620
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,600
-She's fine. -She is my friend with an F.

1621
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,800
-A capital F? -For friend.

1622
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,770
Can I see what you guys are doing?

1623
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:50,990
That's it?

1624
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,190
What? What is it, what is it, what is it.

1625
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,850
-Can I say something? Do you mind? -No.

1626
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,020
-You sure? -Just say it. Say it.

1627
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:56,530
No, please.

1628
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:59,270
I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.

1629
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,170
Let me show you, Pat,

1630
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:01,880
let me show you what I mean.

1631
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,050
You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man.

1632
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,130
You should move more hips.

1633
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,670
Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And...

1634
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:12,600
Yeah. Can you move them a little bit more? Yeah, that's it.

1635
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,760
Move them a bit more.

1636
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,720
You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that.

1637
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,550
Yeah. You're pretty good.

1638
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,730
Okay, we got it, we got it.

1639
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,290
Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul.

1640
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,300
Black it up, Pat.

1641
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,420
-What is that mean? -You know damn well what it means.

1642
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,310
Black it up.

1643
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,260
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man!

1644
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,890
I got an idea.

1645
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,450
Come get some,Pat. Come get some.

1646
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,250
Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back.

1647
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,620
Girl, you gotta move your junk.

1648
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,510
I gotta get out of here.

1649
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,770
I gotta go see this girl, Tanya.

1650
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,820
She lives on this side of town.

1651
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,470
Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.

1652
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,220
Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!

1653
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,020
Bye! Excelsior, Pat!

1654
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,400
-Excelsior! -That's my man. Let's go!

1655
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,860
Patty. Patty.

1656
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,210
Where have you been?

1657
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,680
We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that.

1658
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:54,420
We gotta beat the Giants

1659
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:57,560
if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division,

1660
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,120
any chance of playing in the playoffs.

1661
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,070
Do you realize that?

1662
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,930
-I didn't realize that. -Yeah, that's the bind we're in.

1663
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:10,240
I mean, I think it would be wise if

1664
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,860
we spent father-son time,

1665
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,150
reading about the Eagles, talking about them,

1666
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:17,300
just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in.

1667
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,870
Okay. All right.

1668
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,930
I just wanted to,

1669
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:45,180
maybe I didn't spend enough time with you growing up.

1670
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,920
I spent too much time with your brother.

1671
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,100
It might have made you feel worse about your behavior,

1672
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,260
but I didn't know anything,

1673
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,810
I didn't know how to handle it.

1674
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,400
I mean, that's what all this Eagles stuff is about.

1675
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,310
It's about us, spending time now.

1676
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,830
I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet.

1677
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,500
That's the whole point.

1678
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:22,290
I wish you'd watch these games with me

1679
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:25,090
so we could talk, we could get into things.

1680
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,960
So would you, would you just come downstairs

1681
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,650
and talk to me and Randy now?

1682
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,990
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

1683
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,040
He's betting everything on the Giant game.

1684
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:42,560
Everything.

1685
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,790
All the money that he needs for the restaurant,

1686
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,870
he's betting on the Giant game.

1687
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,310
Tell him why.

1688
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,860
Because he believes in you.

1689
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,080
Is that true?

1690
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,340
I believe in you, Patty.

1691
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,410
I believe in you. I want you to know that.

1692
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,860
So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

1693
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,080
You understand?

1694
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,350
Heavy.

1695
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,720
I want you to go to the game with your brother.

1696
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,070
You want me to go to the game with Jake?

1697
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:09,930
Of course I do. Does he want me to go?

1698
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:11,410
Of course he wants you to go.

1699
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:13,760
-He told you that? -He told me, yes.

1700
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:15,880
Even with all his friends?

1701
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,360
With all his friends. He trusts you.

1702
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,220
He's not embarrassed?

1703
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:21,020
No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know,

1704
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,060
I'm banned from the stadium.

1705
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,300
Because I'd love to see us beat the Giants

1706
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,040
and take a lot of money from this asshole.

1707
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,350
Listen, personally,

1708
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,810
I think it's a stupid bet.

1709
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,360
As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to

1710
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,140
bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.

1711
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,440
Randy. I just hope you heard what I said.

1712
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:42,070
It's like a family business,

1713
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:43,440
it's our family endeavor.

1714
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,860
We all stick together on this.

1715
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:47,040
That's how it works.

1716
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,790
That's a positive, positive vibe.

1717
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,260
I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project,

1718
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,070
and we have a very important part of it

1719
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,610
that we have to go over on Sunday,

1720
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,290
and it's good for me, Dad.

1721
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:06,540
It's making me disciplined and focused,

1722
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,260
and it's-, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.

1723
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,940
What is this thing you're doing?

1724
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,720
Yeah, what is it? What is this project, huh?

1725
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,740
It's a dance thing, okay?

1726
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:21,280
There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

1727
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,970
Listen, I need to ask you something.

1728
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,730
Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you

1729
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,900
and half the day at the Eagles game?

1730
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,270
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.

1731
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:41,070
Why?

1732
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,090
These are the two days that you have promised me

1733
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:47,220
and that we have prepared to nail the big move.

1734
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,130
It's not ready yet.

1735
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,810
And we don't have a move yet.

1736
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,100
I know, but my dad opened up to me

1737
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,350
and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him,

1738
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:57,520
And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up

1739
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,480
and he's concerned that because I'm spending time with you.

1740
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

1741
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,120
No, you're not messing up the juju,

1742
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,660
but the juju is messed up because

1743
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,900
I'm not with him during the games.

1744
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,080
-Guess what? -What?

1745
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,020
Nikki replied to your letter.

1746
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:18,690
But you can't read it until after you nail the big move.

1747
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:19,300
Go.

1748
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,660
Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading

1749
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:41,640
Nikki's letter, okay?

1750
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,830
It's just, it's in the back of my head.

1751
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,280
We don't almost have it, all right?

1752
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,580
-I just hope you can handle it. -Thank you.

1753
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,690
What was her energy when she gave it to you?

1754
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:56,320
She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.

1755
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,220
She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?

1756
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,920
Try to stay positive.

1757
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,600
I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay?

1758
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,460
Because if she says anything that's,

1759
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:15,830
you know, is that too much to ask?

1760
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:16,990
No.

1761
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,310
I thought you were gonna read it out loud.

1762
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,580
Okay. Sorry.

1763
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,820
"Dear Pat,

1764
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,900
It was very emotional for me to get your letter,

1765
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,340
as I'm sure you can imagine,

1766
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,630
but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly

1767
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,950
getting it to me through Tiffany.

1768
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,380
This gives us a chance to communicate

1769
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,700
while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe.

1770
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:51,510
I must admit you sound terrific

1771
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,790
and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive

1772
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:55,020
and becoming a more loving and caring man,

1773
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,430
which I always knew you were.

1774
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,910
I was moved to read about 'excelsior'

1775
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,010
and your belief in happy endings.

1776
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,800
I am also moved by your act of love to read

1777
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:19,390
the books I have taught at the high school.

1778
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,540
I'm sorry you find them so negative,

1779
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,140
but I disagree.

1780
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,710
I think they are great works of art that

1781
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:25,130
reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare

1782
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:27,210
themselves for the hardness of life.

1783
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:30,420
In spite of all these positive developments, Pat,

1784
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,320
I have to say if it's me reading the signs,

1785
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,530
I need to see something to prove

1786
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,740
that you are ready to resume our marriage.

1787
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,950
Otherwise I find myself thinking that

1788
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:43,940
we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately.

1789
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:52,800
Please don't react quickly to this,

1790
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,340
but take time to think about it.

1791
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:57,690
I'm glad you're doing so well.

1792
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,080
Love, Nikki.

1793
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,150
I think I'm done for today, okay?

1794
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,930
She said to show her something, Pat.

1795
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,900
This dance can be that something.

1796
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,540
You would have never done something like this in a million years.

1797
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:29,820
It shows all kinds of skills and so many different levels...

1798
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,640
focus, collaboration, discipline.

1799
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:37,210
It's romantic, like I said it would be.

1800
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:38,800
It's for her.

1801
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:43,440
Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

1802
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:59,640
-Can I use your phone? -Is it an emergency?

1803
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,370
-Yeah, kind of. -What kind of emergency?

1804
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,070
Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany

1805
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:07,560
and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.

1806
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,860
Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know?

1807
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,140
She's not crazy...

1808
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,110
I'll just borrow Jake's phone.

1809
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:16,130
It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium,

1810
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,730
but I know you were kicked out, you know,

1811
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:18,920
for beating everybody up.

1812
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,880
Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?

1813
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:24,890
That a bad thing?

1814
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:27,340
No, I think, it's a good thing.

1815
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,490
Don't drink too much. Don't hit anybody. You'll be fine.

1816
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:33,270
Yeah. I'm solid.

1817
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:41,700
This is my little brother Pat.

1818
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,840
Hey, how you doing?

1819
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,530
So, Pat, what's this I hear about you just gettin' out?

1820
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,750
Yeah, from the looney bin!

1821
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,220
What the fuck?!

1822
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,300
I talked to you about that already!

1823
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,520
-I told you guys... -It's all right.

1824
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,420
He's a good dude! He's a good dude.

1825
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:03,090
Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!

1826
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:05,450
Every week!

1827
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,110
Jake you better get your brother.

1828
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,860
Cuckoo bird's taking off.

1829
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:22,250
Doctor Patel!

1830
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,220
Pat! What are you doing here?

1831
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,730
We must beat the Giants, my brother.

1832
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:31,020
I'm not supposed to be seeing you,

1833
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,520
right? Outside the office?

1834
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,400
-Pat, Pat. -That's illegal!

1835
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,860
Pat, today I'm your brother in green,

1836
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,890
not your therapist.

1837
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:37,910
I'm so happy to see you.

1838
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:39,280
How wonderful that you are here!

1839
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:42,240
Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff.

1840
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,460
Look, two things.

1841
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,060
We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' manning in the backfield

1842
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,140
and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass

1843
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,500
on the line of scrimmage.

1844
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,210
You can say that again. Those cocksuckers!

1845
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:21,780
Okay, you know what?

1846
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,050
I don't have her phone number.

1847
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,410
If you want, if you really want,

1848
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:25,310
you can call Veronica

1849
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:25,970
beause she does,

1850
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:27,650
but I don't want to talk to Veronica.

1851
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,630
Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?

1852
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,000
Because she brings me down, man!

1853
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,090
She just brings me down.

1854
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:31,740
You have to change.

1855
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,520
You're not gonna throw the marriage away.

1856
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:33,670
There's some kind of love there.

1857
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:34,540
I know, I used to see it.

1858
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,820
You guys have a beautiful thing

1859
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,280
that got broken somewhere along the line

1860
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,890
and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor.

1861
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:40,800
You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.

1862
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:42,740
Enough with awkwardness!

1863
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,140
I don't wanna walk in your house

1864
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,010
and not be able to say what I wanna say.

1865
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,900
You're right, man. You're right, you're right,

1866
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,750
Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go!

1867
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,160
What the fuck? What's that smell?

1868
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:58,690
Nasty Indian curry! This is America, baby!

1869
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:00,420
Go back to your country!

1870
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,150
What, what's wrong?

1871
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:05,290
What's going on?

1872
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:07,850
Stay back, Pat. Stay back.

1873
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:11,240
Leave the fucking Indians alone.

1874
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,330
Stay here, stay here!

1875
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,130
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

1876
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:15,050
Don't get in a fight!

1877
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:19,110
I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight.

1878
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:24,990
Not my brother!

1879
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:30,950
Break it up or you'll be arrested!

1880
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,840
What'd you do?

1881
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,620
What happened?

1882
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,690
Dad.

1883
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:56,810
What the fuck happened?

1884
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:57,040
Dad.

1885
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:58,050
The birds lose,

1886
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,620
I lose a fucking fortune, a fortune to Randy!

1887
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,310
What the fuck did you do?

1888
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:03,600
You fucking lost it!

1889
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:05,150
I thought you said you had it together!

1890
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:06,070
You were solid!

1891
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,100
I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad.

1892
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,430
I'm solid, I'm solid now.

1893
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,690
You fell apart! What are you fucking talking about?

1894
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:12,500
Your son was trying to...

1895
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:15,020
It's all fucking ruined now. It's all ruined.

1896
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:15,540
No, Dad!

1897
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,720
It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined!

1898
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:19,270
No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!

1899
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:21,340
It's all ruined, you little fucking shit!

1900
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,830
No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing!

1901
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:24,130
Come on, Dad!

1902
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,720
You loser! You loser!

1903
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,070
I'm not a loser.

1904
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,710
You fucking loser! You ruined everything!

1905
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:30,370
He was defending his brother!

1906
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,150
You fucking idiot!

1907
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:34,450
You spike the ball on the one yard line,

1908
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,160
Who is this? Who's this?

1909
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:39,910
We need to talk right now!

1910
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,660
When you make a serious commitment to somebody,

1911
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,710
it is not cool to not show up!

1912
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:45,350
Wait a second, I tried to call.

1913
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,440
My God, what's happening,

1914
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,380
I called.

1915
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:48,840
But I tried to call you, Tiffany, I...

1916
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:49,980
-Really? -Yes.

1917
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,810
I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you,

1918
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,130
and my dad was pulling me in one direction.

1919
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:53,880
Doctor Patel, Ronnie...

1920
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:56,010
Well, that sounds great, Pat.

1921
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,810
That's great for all of them,

1922
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:58,950
but all of them

1923
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,320
didn't make a commitment to me

1924
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,990
in return for my help.

1925
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,960
I'm Tiffany, by the way.

1926
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,420
What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?

1927
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,120
There's no craziness.

1928
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:11,780
I told you who she was,

1929
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,060
I was doing this thing with her.

1930
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:13,880
We had a conversation!

1931
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,530
She's fucking nuts!

1932
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:15,630
When you started spending time with her,

1933
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,530
it all fell apart.

1934
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,300
This is the fucking reason right here.

1935
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:20,650
You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?

1936
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:23,420
Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since...

1937
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,830
You think that I'm why today's happened?

1938
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:27,500
That's right, you are why today happened.

1939
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,780
I'm the reason why today happened?

1940
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:29,470
I think so.

1941
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:30,350
Let's talk about that.

1942
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:31,660
Be my guest.

1943
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,590
The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's,

1944
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:37,450
the Eagles beat the forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six.

1945
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:39,710
The second time we got together we went for a run,

1946
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:42,670
and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.

1947
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,000
She's right, Dad.

1948
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:46,030
The next time we went for a run

1949
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:48,950
the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-seven to fourteen.

1950
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:52,560
The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner

1951
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,210
and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay

1952
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,110
in the fourth game of the World series, ten to two.

1953
01:27:58,150 --> 01:28:00,580
Let me think about that. Wait a minute.

1954
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,190
Why don't you think about

1955
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,430
when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.

1956
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:05,600
He was with you?

1957
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,170
He was with me. We went for a run.

1958
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:08,440
Really? That's crazy.

1959
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,490
There have been no games

1960
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,680
since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day

1961
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,140
and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to,

1962
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,960
he wouldn't have gotten in a fight,

1963
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,990
he wouldn't be in trouble,

1964
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:18,750
maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.

1965
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,240
She's making a lot of sense, Pop.

1966
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,480
That's all right on all counts.

1967
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,130
Does anybody here happen to know

1968
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:29,130
what the official motto of the state of New York is

1969
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:31,060
on the official seal of the State of New York?

1970
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:35,020
Anybody? Do you? Do you know?

1971
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:39,210
Excelsior. Look it up. Yeah, Excelsior.

1972
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:39,830
Pat.

1973
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,970
Not that I give a fuck about football

1974
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:44,720
or about your superstitions,

1975
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,650
but if it's me reading the signs,

1976
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:50,250
I don't send the eagles guy whose personal motto is excelsior,

1977
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,700
to a fucking Giants game,

1978
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,860
especially when he's already in a legal situation.

1979
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,410
Unbelievable.

1980
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,540
How did you know all that stuff?

1981
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,400
I did my research.

1982
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,890
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

1983
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:05,940
Thank you.

1984
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,770
I gotta rethink this whole thing.

1985
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,950
I didn't trust it before,

1986
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,440
but I gotta say, now I do.

1987
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,430
Now you like her, Dad?

1988
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:18,690
I have to say I do. Yup.

1989
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:21,920
Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?

1990
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,380
You made the bet, I won a lot of money,

1991
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:27,460
and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.

1992
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:30,520
Fuck off, Randy. You love it.

1993
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,790
You live for this shit.

1994
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,200
You've been betting against my father for years.

1995
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,310
Is that right?

1996
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,580
You're twisting the knife right now.

1997
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,260
You get off on it!

1998
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:36,940
That's bullshit!

1999
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,510
That's not true!

2000
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:38,080
Don't say that!

2001
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:38,530
You get off on it!

2002
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,270
Prove it, prove it!

2003
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,800
If not, then prove it. Prove it.

2004
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:42,840
How do you want me to prove it?

2005
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,510
How's he gonna prove it?

2006
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,420
How do I prove it?

2007
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:47,800
By giving them the chance to win back everything,

2008
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,310
double or nothing.

2009
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2010
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,570
Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week?

2011
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:52,660
Is that what you're saying?

2012
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,690
Against the Cowboys.

2013
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:03,510
That's your team, isn't it, Randy?

2014
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:05,090
That's his team!

2015
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,260
I know who his team is.

2016
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:09,740
When is the game?

2017
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,550
December twenty-eight, last game of the season.

2018
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:12,740
Oh, my God.

2019
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,290
Same day as the Benjamin Franklin

2020
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:16,170
Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.

2021
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:17,200
Oh God.

2022
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,310
Randy, I thought they were America's Team.

2023
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:20,540
Don't you believe in America's Team?

2024
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:22,280
Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?

2025
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,110
Yeah, I believe in America's team

2026
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:26,460
but if I win that bet,

2027
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:27,490
I win your book,

2028
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,290
you're out of action,

2029
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:30,640
you get no restaurant,

2030
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,530
no nothing.

2031
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,810
I like it.

2032
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:35,920
No. No, Patrizio.

2033
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,720
I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son,

2034
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,130
I'll take the action. I'll take it.

2035
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,850
-Dad! -Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

2036
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:43,190
I have faith, I have faith.

2037
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:44,520
Excelsior belongs in this house.

2038
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,370
Dad.

2039
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:46,670
Not in the State of New York.

2040
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:47,430
In this house.

2041
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:48,490
Dad, listen to me.

2042
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:49,490
I didn't know that Excelsior

2043
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:50,790
was the state motto of New York, okay?

2044
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:51,910
I didn't know, either, but now I know.

2045
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,400
I know, but listen to me, this is toxic.

2046
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:54,400
Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic,

2047
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:55,370
you shouldn't be doing this,

2048
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:56,170
you shouldn't be doing...

2049
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:57,110
Randy, what do you say?

2050
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,070
Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough.

2051
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:58,520
Randy, what do you say?

2052
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:01,010
My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored

2053
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:02,460
by one and a half points.

2054
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:03,270
I 'll give you three more.

2055
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:04,670
Patrizio, stop it!

2056
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:06,930
And Randy, don't you take the bet!

2057
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,450
In fact, I'll give you ten points.

2058
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:10,580
No, Dad! Dad!

2059
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,470
Dad!

2060
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:16,720
You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.

2061
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,170
Dolores, would you stop him? Jesus!

2062
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:19,910
How could you not take that bet?

2063
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,760
Even with the ten points I give you,

2064
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,910
that's an insane spread to your advantage.

2065
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,120
Cowboys are cowards.

2066
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,070
And I'll bet you're such a coward,

2067
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:28,270
You won't take the ten.

2068
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:29,660
Plus, are you listening,

2069
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,590
plus whatever their score is at the dance thing.

2070
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,040
What's that? Tiffany, what's that?

2071
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:36,240
What? No. You're crazy to give away that many points.

2072
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,070
That's ridiculous!

2073
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:37,940
I won't take that!

2074
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,020
However, wait a second.

2075
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:44,490
I do like the idea of a parlay.

2076
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,290
What? No parlay!

2077
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:50,070
No, don't do it. Don't do it.

2078
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,620
Pat, how do they run this dance competition?

2079
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,720
I mean, how do they score it and everything?

2080
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,540
I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score!

2081
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,270
We're participating.

2082
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,560
We're not, we're not a part of it.

2083
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,200
There are people.

2084
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,500
This is a high-end dance contest.

2085
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,180
I don't know.

2086
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,130
Do not put it as part of the parlay,

2087
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:04,400
Randy. Don't.

2088
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,800
They go by the Philadelphia rules.

2089
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,880
Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten,

2090
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:08,880
ten being the highest.

2091
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,250
You have to average the four judges' scores.

2092
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,650
Okay, score is from one to ten, right?

2093
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:14,710
And you guys are how good?

2094
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:15,320
We suck.

2095
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,510
We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,

2096
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:19,800
I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.

2097
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,010
And how are the people you're competing against?

2098
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,060
They're good. Some of them are professionals.

2099
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,200
They're good? Better than you?

2100
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,450
A lot better.

2101
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:28,260
A lot better.

2102
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:31,480
So if I was to say you only have to score five,

2103
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,220
I would be really very generous, right?

2104
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,560
No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away...

2105
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,130
Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten!

2106
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:40,500
Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!

2107
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,440
We can't get five!

2108
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,610
We can do a five.

2109
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:45,010
What are you talking about, Dad?

2110
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,880
That's the parlay.

2111
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,410
Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?

2112
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:49,520
You gotta win two bets

2113
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,830
or you lose the whole thing.

2114
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,970
For Pat Sr., to win,

2115
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:53,710
the birds gotta beat the Cowboys

2116
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:57,230
plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.

2117
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,790
That's very, very manic indeed.

2118
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,020
That's the parlay.

2119
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,640
Shake on it.

2120
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:06,430
You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this.

2121
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:08,010
Randy, you're a sickness.

2122
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,560
You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

2123
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:10,860
Pat, you can't quit.

2124
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,460
I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

2125
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,810
Pat.

2126
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:15,150
calm down. Thank about it.

2127
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,360
Pat, no.

2128
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,900
What are you doing?

2129
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,360
-Pat. -I'm out.

2130
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:23,200
Here we are again at the one yard line.

2131
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,990
DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

2132
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:27,000
There you go.

2133
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:28,130
What does that even mean, dad?

2134
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:29,370
I'm not gonna make that connection

2135
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:30,790
that you're making with DeSean Jackson.

2136
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,890
It doesn't matter anymore, okay?

2137
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:33,480
Just because I have the fucking jersey on.

2138
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,990
I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

2139
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,070
You are not a stand up guy right now.

2140
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,780
If it's me reading the signs...

2141
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,310
If it's you reading the signs?

2142
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:42,330
You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.

2143
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,150
You are not a stand up guy!

2144
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:56,920
I told you not to push it.

2145
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:58,890
Yeah, but he's gotta do this thing.

2146
01:33:58,890 --> 01:33:59,760
He can't be a quitter.

2147
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,860
He cannot be a quitter.

2148
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:03,390
You took that stupid parlay thing,

2149
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:05,680
and now he won't do the dance

2150
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,200
and it was very constructive for him,

2151
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,330
and you ruined it.

2152
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:09,680
There's only one way to get him to show.

2153
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,580
What's that?

2154
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,530
We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there.

2155
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:32,040
She can't come.

2156
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,180
We have to tell him that she's coming.

2157
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,480
We have to tell him that she's going.

2158
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,200
But that's a lie!

2159
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,080
It's a white lie.

2160
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,450
It's a white lie, what's that matter?

2161
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:39,050
That's no big deal.

2162
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:39,920
So it's a little lie.

2163
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,230
There's no other way.

2164
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:44,030
You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs

2165
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:45,480
He can live his life

2166
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,710
without ruining it.

2167
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:51,500
No. I don't approve. You can't do it.

2168
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,300
Well, you know, I didn't approve when you called her

2169
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,070
and you told her where he was running,

2170
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,570
so she could ambush him.

2171
01:34:57,570 --> 01:34:58,070
I didn't approve of that,

2172
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,450
but you did it anyway,

2173
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:02,210
so I'm doing this anyway. That's it.

2174
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:04,810
We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.

2175
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:10,990
You gotta be part of it.

2176
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:12,790
We have to do it.

2177
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:16,020
Aren't you nervous to be lying?

2178
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:22,850
A little bit. But it's for the best.

2179
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:28,560
But if it was me reading the signs...

2180
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,480
-That's it. -Okay.

2181
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,800
What's up?

2182
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:42,700
Sorry I'm late.

2183
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,220
It's fine.

2184
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,270
Come on, it's gonna be great.

2185
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:13,790
Nikki's gonna be there. You know?

2186
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:15,860
Everything's gonna come together.

2187
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:18,730
It's what's meant to be. You okay?

2188
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,950
Don't get wobbly on me.

2189
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:23,780
I'm not.

2190
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:26,130
We have a dance to do.

2191
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:26,820
We have a parlay.

2192
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:27,900
You gotta stay focused.

2193
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:28,890
I'm focused.

2194
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,120
Okay, let's go.

2195
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:51,410
-Look at the dancers. You see them? -Shit.

2196
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,470
Randy, Jake. What do we got?

2197
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,700
Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three.

2198
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,350
I'm worried about the bet.

2199
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:03,430
Don't worry about the bet.

2200
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:04,300
I'm worried about the bet.

2201
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:06,600
Holy shit.

2202
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,100
Is this Dancing with the Stars?

2203
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,330
Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted them.

2204
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,350
Look at those fucking dancers!

2205
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:23,250
You can give me the money now, you know?

2206
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:26,070
Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five.

2207
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:26,600
That's all.

2208
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,930
You stay here and watch the game with me.

2209
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:29,950
The birds are better when Pat is with me.

2210
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:30,790
We settled that.

2211
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:32,770
Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay?

2212
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:34,470
I'll see you in a little bit.

2213
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,340
I'll see you up there, okay?

2214
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:35,590
Okay.

2215
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,790
Pat, Tiffany!

2216
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:40,490
What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man.

2217
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,450
-All right, buddy, I'll see you. -Alright.

2218
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,090
Wish me luck, man.

2219
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,230
Excelsior!

2220
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:49,230
Wait, what's this?

2221
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,310
What? I thought you were doing it.

2222
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,360
I thought you were doing it.

2223
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,550
We're doing a dance thing anyway, for God's sake.

2224
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,470
I want you to remember everything.

2225
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:05,670
I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here.

2226
01:40:05,830 --> 01:40:06,690
Of course I do.

2227
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:09,070
Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.

2228
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:11,640
-Hi, good evening. -Evening.

2229
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,050
Check in? How many dancers are there?

2230
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:23,660
What? Nikki? Nikki.

2231
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,660
Oh, Jesus.

2232
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,790
What the fuck?

2233
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:48,220
Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.

2234
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,460
You're killing me. You're killing me!

2235
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,800
Tiffany, please. She'll see how well he's doing.

2236
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:54,260
Maybe she'll lift the restraining order.

2237
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,930
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2238
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,530
Pat told me. He told me

2239
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:01,090
you should never throw a marriage out the window.

2240
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,930
Pat did not say that. He didn't say that.

2241
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,540
He said it several times, Tiffany,

2242
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:06,550
and this is his chance.

2243
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:07,860
You gotta give him a chance.

2244
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:43,820
Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?

2245
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:10,410
So, you want another one?

2246
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:11,200
Sure.

2247
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:22,670
So what do you do?

2248
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:25,900
I'm a lawyer. Litigator, actually.

2249
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:31,550
The arguing kind.

2250
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:38,160
seven point six, seven point three, seven point four, six point nine

2251
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:42,410
for an average score of seven point three.

2252
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:47,800
Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas!

2253
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:51,860
They are on their way to the playoffs.

2254
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:00,950
Where's Tiffany?

2255
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:03,310
I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?

2256
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:04,110
You gotta find her.

2257
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:04,980
I know, mom, I know.

2258
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:33,340
What are you doing?

2259
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:34,770
She's fine, buddy, she's with me.

2260
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:35,740
-She's fine? -Yeah.

2261
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,040
Why don't you shut up, okay?

2262
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,350
How many drinks have you had?

2263
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:40,430
I've had two vodkas.

2264
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:42,190
Listen, I don't know what choices you've made,

2265
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:43,400
but you gotta deal with it right now, okay?

2266
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:43,980
We're in this.

2267
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:45,810
We're in what?

2268
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:50,130
Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.

2269
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:50,970
You know, I used to think

2270
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:51,740
that you were the best thing

2271
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:52,930
that ever happened to me,

2272
01:44:52,930 --> 01:44:54,180
but now I think

2273
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,600
that you might maybe be the worst thing

2274
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,270
and I'm sorry that I ever met you.

2275
01:44:57,730 --> 01:44:58,330
Good for you. Come on, let's dance.

2276
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:02,520
And the scores for Makarov and Tretiak,

2277
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:09,490
six point seven, eight point one, seven point five, six point five

2278
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:14,380
for an average score of seven point two.

2279
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:23,420
They were great and they only got a seven point two.

2280
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:24,690
This is a tough room.

2281
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:25,620
Got it.

2282
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,610
Up next, ladies and gentlemen

2283
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:36,000
please welcome Pat Solatano, Jr., and Tiffany Maxwell.

2284
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:40,960
Come on, Pat!

2285
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:45,710
Damn.

2286
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:55,310
Come on, Pat!

2287
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:55,920
Yeah, Pat.

2288
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:09,010
Alright, let's see the scores for Solatano and Maxwell.

2289
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:15,130
We have a four point nine, four eight, a four nine.

2290
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:18,600
That's really too bad, guys. That's a lot of fours.

2291
01:49:19,450 --> 01:49:21,570
And and a five point four

2292
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:25,550
for an average score of five point zero.

2293
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:30,690
Sorry about that, guys.

2294
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,500
Dad, Dad, did the Eagles win?

2295
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,110
The Eagles won, forty-four-six!

2296
01:49:39,110 --> 01:49:40,380
They won, forty-four-six!

2297
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:43,550
Come on!

2298
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:47,360
Why are they so excited about a five?

2299
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:57,290
Thank you. You are amazsing.

2300
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:25,000
How are you? You okay?

2301
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:25,480
Good.

2302
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:26,270
How are you?

2303
01:50:26,270 --> 01:50:27,850
I'm really good. Thanks.

2304
01:50:28,190 --> 01:50:29,720
You looked really happy out there.

2305
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,210
Did I?

2306
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:31,290
Yeah.

2307
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:33,140
Who'd have thought, dancing?

2308
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:39,000
You look incredible.

2309
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:39,700
Thank you.

2310
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,810
You lost a lot of weight.

2311
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,310
I've been reading your books and,

2312
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:44,720
I have a positive attitude.

2313
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,560
I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.

2314
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:49,500
Where's Tiffany?

2315
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:49,860
She left.

2316
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:50,990
What do you mean, she left?

2317
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:51,990
She left.

2318
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:53,460
What do you think! Where is she?

2319
01:51:54,350 --> 01:51:54,850
Let me tell you,

2320
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:56,410
I know you don't wanna listen to your father,

2321
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,480
I didn't listen to mine

2322
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,400
but I'm telling you,

2323
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,140
you gotta pay attention to the signs.

2324
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:02,100
When life reaches out with a moment like this,

2325
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,630
it's a sin if you don't reach back.

2326
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:04,590
I'm telling you, it's a sin

2327
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,960
if you don't reach back,

2328
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:06,730
and it'll haunt you

2329
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:08,340
for the rest of your days like a curse.

2330
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:10,080
You're facing a big challenge in your life

2331
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,860
right now, at this very moment, right here.

2332
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:13,590
That girl loves you, she really loves you.

2333
01:52:13,590 --> 01:52:15,050
And I don't know if Nikki ever did,

2334
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:17,190
but she sure as hell doesn't love you right now.

2335
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:18,600
I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.

2336
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:23,030
I love you, Dad.

2337
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,200
Would you just leave me alone?

2338
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:58,110
Wait a second!

2339
01:52:58,110 --> 01:52:59,890
I have one more letter for you to read, okay?

2340
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:01,380
What the fuck is the matter with you?

2341
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,340
Give it to her yourself!

2342
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:03,310
Let me say something.

2343
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:04,600
You don't ever have to see me again

2344
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:05,700
if you just read it, alright?

2345
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:07,940
This is so fucked up.

2346
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,180
Yeah, just read it.

2347
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:12,950
Dear Tiffany...

2348
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:18,810
I know you wrote the letter.

2349
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:28,520
The only way you could meet my craziness

2350
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,590
was by doing something crazy yourself.

2351
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:33,070
Thank you.

2352
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:34,450
I love you.

2353
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:40,430
I knew it the minute I met you.

2354
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:44,280
I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up.

2355
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:48,250
I just got stuck. Pat.

2356
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:53,870
I wrote that a week ago.

2357
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:56,460
You wrote that a week ago?

2358
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:57,800
Yes, I did.

2359
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:59,670
You let me lie to you for a week?

2360
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:02,320
I was trying to be romantic.

2361
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:06,100
You love me?

2362
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:08,160
Yeah, I do.

2363
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:15,360
Okay.

2364
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:53,280
The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday,

2365
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,780
that's guaranteed.

2366
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,830
And I can't begin to explain that

2367
01:54:56,830 --> 01:54:59,950
or the craziness inside myself and everybody else,

2368
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:00,940
but guess what?

2369
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:03,000
Sunday is my favorite day again.

2370
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:07,020
I think of everything everyone did for me

2371
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:09,510
and I feel like a very lucky guy.

2372
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,170
We have to beat the Vikings by three.

2373
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,280
I'm giving you a six,

2374
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,490
which is very generous

2375
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,900
after the beating you just took.

2376
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:18,860
So what are we doing,

2377
01:55:18,860 --> 01:55:20,350
what are we talking about here?

2378
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:21,830
I'd like to do another parlay

2379
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:24,210
if we make it to the next round, that's all.

2380
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:25,560
But we are gonna make it to the next round.

2381
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:26,320
We're gonna beat...

2382
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:27,970
No, that was me that did that.

2383
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:28,970
No, that was me.

2384
01:55:29,450 --> 01:55:30,190
That was me.

2385
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:31,370
I played the Jack.

2386
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:35,150
So you put the bread crumbs, the garlic in the steak

2387
01:55:35,150 --> 01:55:36,450
and you roll it up with the toothpicks?

2388
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:39,490
Yeah. For, maybe three hours, plus.

2389
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:41,560
Everything's good.

2390
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:42,990
I got you, you're all down.

2391
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,410
No, Randy, he's complaining.

2392
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:47,060
You know he lost a lot of money. He's moaning and groaning.

2393
01:55:47,060 --> 01:55:49,640
The restaurant's happening because of Randy,

2394
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,130
so everything's good.
