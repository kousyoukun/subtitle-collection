00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:24,834
<i>Very, very long ago,</i>

3
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,834
<i>Someone said that men
were born free and equal.</i>

4
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,834
<i>All men.</i>

5
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:33,167
<i>And all women.</i>

6
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:34,751
<i>All equal.</i>

7
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:38,167
<i>The rules of the game would
be the same for everyone.</i>

8
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:39,917
<i>We would be on equal terms.</i>

9
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,292
<i>Life would be right.</i>

10
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,042
<i>But even if that was true,</i>

11
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,792
<i>a microsecond after birth,</i>

12
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:48,792
<i>chance is involved.</i>

13
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,167
<i>There are your parents,</i>

14
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,209
<i>your neighborhood,</i>

15
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:53,834
<i>your standard of living,</i>

16
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:55,042
<i>your health,</i>

17
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,084
<i>your height,</i>

18
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,459
<i>your appearance.</i>

19
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:01,751
<i>As soon as the tyranny of chance
begins to impose its law,</i>

20
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,792
<i>we are no longer on equal terms.</i>

21
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,626
<i>Chance changes everything.</i>

22
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,709
<i>In the end,</i>

23
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,834
<i>we do with what he gives us.</i>

00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:15,417
THE EXTRAORDINARY
TRAVEL OF THE FAKIR

25
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:20,459
<i>This is the story of
Ajatashatru Lavash Patel.</i>

26
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,001
<i>And here are the cards</i>

27
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:24,251
<i>that chance gave him.</i>

28
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,876
The judge is a bastard!

29
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,501
It's a junk! A dirty cockroach!

30
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,167
You are all idiots!

31
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:42,001
Who are you? What do you want ?

32
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,376
Dirty bug! You're a shit!

33
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,251
You're a shabby, you're too bad!

34
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,334
Get out!

35
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:51,084
Are you coming to beat us up?

36
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:55,042
- The other said that.
- And then he beat us!

37
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,792
I'm coming to tell a story.

38
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,626
A story?

39
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,459
What kind of story?

40
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,042
A tragedy.

41
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,126
I prefer to be beaten.

42
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,126
The judge sentenced you to 4
years in prison for juveniles.

43
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,084
You have time for a story.

44
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,084
Can I?

45
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,542
I was born in Bombay,

46
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,126
in the very small district of Worli.

47
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:28,709
When I was a child,

48
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:32,417
I did not know anything about the rest of the world.

49
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,209
Nothing.

50
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,626
Siringh, the sheets
are not ready yet?

51
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,792
You have to work faster!

52
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:43,709
<i>I am the only son of a wonderful,
loving, hardworking woman,</i>

53
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,709
<i>Siringh Lavash Patel.</i>

54
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,376
4 more bags of linen!

55
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,167
We'll have to stay late!

56
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,709
Aja, stop your bad moves.

57
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:57,209
You have to stop!

58
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,417
Stop getting you into trouble.

59
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,709
They will take you away.

60
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:03,584
I am a single mother.
You understand ?

61
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,459
We will take you away from me.

62
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:10,709
Stop doing bad things
with your cousins.

63
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,751
If you are sent to prison,

64
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,001
I will not come looking for you.

65
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,626
I will not come.

66
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:25,376
Eat.

67
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,584
You are too skinny.

68
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:35,792
You must be strong

69
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,292
if you want me to take
you to Paris one day.

70
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,084
Eat.

71
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:43,584
Eat!

72
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,126
Come on, you're too skinny.
Eat, Moohini.

73
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,209
Eat!

74
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,501
<i>When I was little,</i>

75
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:55,501
<i>my mother said I did
not have a father.</i>

76
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:58,501
<i>She claimed that I was
a kind of miracle,</i>

77
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,834
<i>arrived as if by magic.</i>

78
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,126
<i>Obviously,</i>

79
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:05,626
<i>I did not believe it.</i>

80
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,251
Mom, it's him?

81
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,584
I need the sheets of hotels
Maharaja and Presidency.

82
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,501
Now! Quick !

83
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,376
Why is it so long?

84
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,501
Hurry!

85
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,417
Mom...

86
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,334
it's him?

87
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:33,917
It's him?

88
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:36,334
No, it's not him!

89
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,334
Stop asking me the
same question!

90
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,084
You do not have a father.

91
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,709
You are very beautiful.

92
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,834
My little man.

93
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,917
Let's review the continents.
The continents are Europe...

94
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,709
<i>Before school, my
world was very small.</i>

95
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,167
<i>We did not have TV or internet.</i>

96
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,459
<i>My world was expanding</i>

97
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,751
<i>from my cousin Bhatuk to
my cousin Bheem's home.</i>

98
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,042
<i>Nothing else existed for me.</i>

99
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,084
<i>So while discovering the rest of the
world, I learned a staggering thing...</i>

100
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,417
Mom!

101
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:29,292
<i>I was poor.</i>

102
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:30,376
Are we poor?

103
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:33,584
Yes!

104
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,792
Why do you say we are not poor?

105
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,792
I went to school.
I know things.

106
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,209
We are very poor.

107
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,626
We are rich because
we are together.

108
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,584
It does not make us rich.

109
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:53,834
We will do other exams.
This is very serious.

110
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:56,876
I'm sorry...

111
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,542
I understand.

112
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,251
<i>And then one day,</i>

113
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,167
<i>at the doctor,</i>

114
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,834
<i>I made an extraordinary discovery.</i>

115
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,709
It's the same model,

116
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,667
with different colors.

117
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,542
This one is the best.

118
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:21,292
And they have names too cool.

119
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,751
The Vinterdimma collection,

120
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,792
Rostig Lördag collection,

121
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,709
the Bergman Bögart collection.

122
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:31,376
Mom, when I'm very, very rich,

123
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,834
I will have a Borgshot room.

124
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:37,501
Moohini, in the living room, we
will have the Scötken coffee table.

125
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,876
My favorite collection is...

126
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,792
the Djup Sömn collection,

127
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,209
special edition Trädtoppar.

128
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,292
The Khoobsurut collection,
signed Ajatashatru.

129
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:58,459
The Sundaryat collection, signed
by the famous Ajatashatru.

130
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,542
And the Taranchalah Collection,

131
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:04,626
signed by the extraordinary Ajatashatru.

132
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,417
Stop doing that.

133
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,001
It was my father?

134
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,459
<i>That year, two
things became clear.</i>

135
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:14,876
<i>One: I was poor.</i>

136
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:17,834
<i>Two: I did not want to be poor anymore.</i>

137
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,042
Excuse me.

138
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,292
Faster!

139
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:41,459
Here.

140
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,042
Hurry up!

141
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:46,126
Quickly!

142
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,626
This is very heavy.

143
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,667
Come near!

144
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,751
Come see the famous Aja!

145
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,501
<i>Over the years,</i>

146
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,459
<i>we did all kinds
of magic tricks.</i>

147
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,001
Spectacle of magic!

148
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:28,834
<i>Levitation.</i>

149
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:34,167
<i>Illusions.</i>

150
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,084
<i>Psychic surgery.</i>

151
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,209
My friends.

152
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:43,667
This is your first trip to India?

153
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,667
First trip to India?

154
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,584
Super.

155
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:01,417
<i>More and more, magic was only a
small part of our activities.</i>

156
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,126
We won that?

157
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,126
Next time, 40%.

158
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,459
Not 40%!

159
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,876
This is my neighborhood.

160
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:19,626
<i>Hi.</i>

161
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:24,042
<i>Sorry for the delay, I was
stuck at work by a dinosaur...</i>

162
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:28,667
Mom, I want you to eat, the
doctor says you have to eat.

163
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:30,417
Aja...

164
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:35,501
Mom, you must be strong for
me to take you to Paris.

165
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:38,584
We do not have money to go to Paris.

166
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,626
I'm going to take you to Paris.

167
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,709
Who will take care of Moohini?

168
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,709
Moohini is sacred, you're not
supposed to take care of her.

169
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,792
It is she who has to take care of you.

170
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,417
Let's go to Paris.

171
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,251
Tonight, you eat.

172
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,376
Yes, Aja.

173
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:00,334
<i>But before we can go to Paris,</i>

174
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,917
<i>the bad news has fallen.</i>

175
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,084
A worry, Moohini?

176
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:11,584
<i>His heart...</i>

177
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:14,542
stopped.

178
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,209
So, she never went to Paris?

179
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,251
Chance did not help
me keep this promise.

180
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:22,376
<i>My father's name was Pierre-André Martin.</i>

181
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,667
<i>He was French, from Paris.</i>

182
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,459
<i>A street artist, like me.</i>

183
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:34,084
<i>He had written to my mother
hundreds of sublime love letters.</i>

184
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,584
<i>One said</i>

185
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,084
<i>that if my mother's parents
allowed her to marry him,</i>

186
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:42,501
<i>She had to go to Paris, at
the top of the Eiffel Tower.</i>

187
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,876
<i>He would wait there every Sunday.</i>

188
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,751
<i>If he was not there,</i>

189
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,501
<i>she had to fold the letter
in the shape of an airplane</i>

190
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,751
<i>and throw it to the city.</i>

191
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,459
<i>He would lead her to him by magic.</i>

192
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:06,751
<i>I borrowed a few rupees from Giri.</i>

193
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,667
<i>We were going to Paris.</i>

194
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,084
Go, find another family.

195
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,834
Watch over me, Moohini!

196
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,376
Go away!

197
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,751
<i>Wearing only the
ashes of my mother,</i>

198
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:24,001
<i>A passport and a counterfeit 100,</i>

199
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,626
<i>I made the long trip to Paris,</i>

200
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,417
<i>to find my father.</i>

201
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,084
This is your first trip to Paris?

202
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,251
Perfect.

203
00:13:58,376 --> 00:13:59,792
Want a taxi?

204
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,084
- That's why...
- Please, follow me.

205
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,084
Where do you want to go first?

206
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,334
Some want to see the Eiffel Tower.

207
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,626
An obvious choice.

208
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,542
But some dream of Montmartre,
others go to the Louvre.

209
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,709
Others at the Champs-Élysées.

210
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:19,376
Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.

211
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:22,084
You will see everything
for the first time.

212
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,667
The Arc de Triomphe
for the first time.

213
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,751
The gardens of Luxembourg.

214
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,001
It's going to be the
best day of your life.

215
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:33,167
Tell your children
and grandchildren.

216
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:35,126
You are lucky.

217
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,834
I do not know if there is Uber at home,

218
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,376
but in Paris, they kill the job.

219
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:44,001
They steal our job. It's ugly.

220
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,917
Uber, it's hell.

221
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,042
I have to do a second job on weekends.

222
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:49,501
What are you doing?

223
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,501
Uber.

224
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,209
What does the government do?

225
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,292
<i>And then, I understood</i>

226
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:01,209
<i>that this man was stealing me.</i>

227
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,709
<i>Gustave was a thief.</i>

228
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:08,667
<i>He was fantastic.</i>

229
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,167
<i>Polite, playful conversation.</i>

230
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,792
<i>Very endearing personality.</i>

231
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,459
<i>I should have been
furious, but I was not.</i>

232
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,001
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

233
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,709
<i>it was me, the rich tourist.</i>

234
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,751
Aja, do you have my number?

235
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,667
Yes, absolutely.

236
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,042
Here.

237
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,709
Thank you very much.

238
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,334
Gustave, it's an honor...

239
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,376
A privilege to know you.

240
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:51,501
No, all the honor is for me.

241
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,334
See you soon.

242
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:13,251
Such a beautiful city.

243
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,876
And so many choices.

244
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,292
Where did you want to go first?

245
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,209
At my favorite furniture store.

246
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:35,209
Hedar och Skogar.

247
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,084
The best sofa in the world.

248
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,251
The extraordinary Vinterdimma collection.

249
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,417
The cushions Döva Tidvatten.

250
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,751
The elegant Sharton collection.

251
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,626
The Brandchat collection.

252
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,251
<i>Have you ever been in love?</i>

253
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,084
You...

254
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,251
it happened to you?

255
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:28,792
I am 13 years old.

256
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,917
- He likes Naveena.
- Not true.

257
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,709
She is 16 years old and he loves her.

258
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:33,626
Shut up!

259
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,001
He does not like it?

260
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,417
Yes, he loves it!

261
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,584
Do not go, or I hit you.

262
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,001
Stop.

263
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,292
It's nothing.

264
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:43,792
It does not matter if you like it.

265
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:44,876
I do not like it!

266
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:50,459
Brief.

267
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:55,501
Due to a unique
geomagnetic field,

268
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:57,167
love in Paris

269
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:59,584
<i>is ten times stronger than elsewhere.</i>

270
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,376
<i>For centuries,</i>

271
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:05,001
love in Paris
inspires many books,

272
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,292
movies, songs, poems, paintings.

273
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,501
Did you know?

274
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:13,501
What is the school for?

275
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,709
We do not go there.

276
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:20,126
You do not go to school...

277
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:23,292
Honey, sorry for
coming back from work,

278
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,459
the traffic was hellish.

279
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:30,751
I promised to make the
meal, do not get angry.

280
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,876
I'm cooking, it'll be delicious.

281
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:43,459
Excuse me, I have to test
the salon before buying it.

282
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,626
A salon is not a design,

283
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,292
it's mostly what we feel

284
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,792
when we enter.

285
00:18:58,126 --> 00:19:00,334
Honey, where are my car keys?

286
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:03,126
Did you see them?

287
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:07,834
My God!

288
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,751
My boss drives me crazy.

289
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:16,209
Do you feel under pressure, darling?

290
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:18,542
Do this to me?

291
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,042
With my own brother?

292
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,584
I am not his brother.

293
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,084
Your brother and I, we love each other.

294
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,709
We are going to live in Guatemala.

295
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,501
Not that...

296
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,376
Not in Guatemala!

297
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,417
I am pregnant.

298
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,001
What?

299
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:39,334
Because of this unique
geomagnetic field,

300
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:42,501
between Marie and me,
it stuck right away.

301
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:46,334
Why a beautiful American woman would
be interested in an Indian fakir?

302
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:48,876
I do not know.

303
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,709
But chance seemed finally
to be on my side.

304
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,251
That day,

305
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:55,542
Marie listened to me

306
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,834
while I was telling him about India.

307
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,167
<i>The colors and sounds.</i>

308
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,376
<i>The clothes, the tastes.</i>

309
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,001
<i>Its hundreds of languages.</i>

310
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,417
<i>His religions, his customs.</i>

311
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,501
<i>The immensity of Bombay</i>

312
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,751
<i>and the charm of my little neighborhood.</i>

313
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,626
It's like that in deep India.

314
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,626
I have to go.

315
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,251
Since leaving Chicago,

316
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:35,584
I have a boring job in an
American consulting firm,

317
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,001
which is called Wilson & Williams.

318
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:40,251
Why did you leave Chicago?

319
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:45,209
I left with my
best friend, Rose.

320
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:49,292
My parents hate her.
She would have a bad influence.

321
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,834
That's right?

322
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,251
According to them, it's his fault if I
plated my future husband in church.

323
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,084
Take this newspaper article.

324
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:11,501
Why?

325
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,542
It's like the promise

326
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,876
we'll see each other again

327
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,126
Because I like it a lot.

328
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,251
And I keep your pen.

329
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,292
How did you get...

330
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,501
To tomorrow.

331
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:27,542
I do not know...

332
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,084
At the Eiffel Tower?

333
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:31,376
19 hours.

334
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,251
Yes, but it's not a date.

335
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,709
Never date?

336
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,459
Never date.

337
00:21:49,626 --> 00:21:53,542
In Paris, we make the kiss on the cheek.

338
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,376
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,084
It's nothing.

340
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:24,001
I thought I could
become a lesbian.

341
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:26,167
Why?

342
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:27,459
Why not?

343
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,626
You do not like sleeping
with women and...

344
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:35,167
without going forward, it's a
bit like that, being lesbian.

345
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,501
I could learn to love that.

346
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,292
Small, I hated broccoli,

347
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,626
now, I eat it all the time.

348
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,917
And it's a way of life that's so cool.

349
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:48,167
Rose, you're 27 years old.

350
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,834
You would know, if you were lesbian.

351
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:03,709
What?

352
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,209
I may have met someone.

353
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,501
Finally!

354
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,334
Slowly...

355
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,501
It's a girl?

356
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,792
<i>Not having money,</i>

357
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,376
<i>I decided to stay overnight.</i>

358
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,209
Exhausted by my trip,

359
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,501
I quickly fell asleep.

360
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:47,584
Alas,

361
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,376
<i>I was wrong.</i>

362
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:52,167
<i>Chance was still not on my side.</i>

363
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:53,501
<i>Not at all.</i>

364
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,501
<i>In the middle of the night,</i>

365
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:57,917
<i>among the 2,000 furniture...</i>

366
00:23:58,084 --> 00:23:58,792
That one.

367
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,209
<i>And 15 cabinet models,</i>

368
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:04,459
<i>it's mine they chose.</i>

369
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:08,501
<i>Chance was really
not on my side.</i>

370
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,667
<i>Welcome to England</i>

371
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,042
Where are we? Where are we going ?

372
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,709
In the land of milk and honey.

373
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,209
Milk and honey?

374
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:47,084
In London.

375
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,459
Yes, where everything grows in abundance,

376
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,792
cars, houses, jobs.

377
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,001
And beer. Full of beer.

378
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,584
We do not drink it.

379
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:57,751
We hate that.

380
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:01,167
Are you illegal immigrants?

381
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:02,834
Not you?

382
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,876
No, I am a tourist.

383
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:05,834
A tourist?

384
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:08,084
Traveling in a wardrobe?

385
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,917
Do you make the cabinet circuit?

386
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:15,126
Full of room for the
legs, in wardrobe.

387
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:18,834
I went to Bora Bora in a
business class wardrobe.

388
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,001
That's right, I'm a tourist.

389
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:23,209
We too.

390
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:25,667
I have my passport, I come from India.

391
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:27,292
Look.

392
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:31,042
Somalia.

393
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:35,334
It's been 18 months since we traveled.

394
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,459
We walked for weeks.

395
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,334
At the beginning, we were much more numerous.

396
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:42,584
In Libya,

397
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,751
bandits attacked us.

398
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,209
Then the smugglers sank the boat

399
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,751
3 km from the Italian coast.

400
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:54,751
Only a few have reached the shore.

401
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:57,584
Then we crossed the French border.

402
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,876
Now, we are only five.

403
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,417
Why endure all this?

404
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:08,751
Our families have been
displaced by the war.

405
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:14,626
We must send them money.
They are starving.

406
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:18,417
That's not your case?

407
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,542
I am a tourist.

408
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,626
There is an African proverb that says:

409
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,376
"The one who swallows coconuts

410
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:29,292
" has confidence in his trouduc. "

411
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,459
I do not see the report.

412
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,792
No report.

413
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:36,834
But I love this proverb.

414
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:40,042
Why do we stop?

415
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,459
What's going on?

416
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,751
- Dogs...
- Which dogs?

417
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:48,834
On file.

418
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:02,876
Border police.

419
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:03,834
I have my passport.

420
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,417
Never show it

421
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:06,417


422
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:12,459
On file!

423
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,042
Do not move!

424
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,459
Police, stop!

425
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:20,417
Good God!

426
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,501
Moohini?
You're not supposed to watch over me?  Stop!

427
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:28,459
Left!

428
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,626
I can not go home.

429
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,501
You, stop!

430
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,751
Over here!

431
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:10,709
Do not move anymore.

432
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,584
Wait.

433
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,626
I am Ajatashatru Lavash Patel,

434
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:26,501
a famous Indian fakir.

435
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:28,459
So much for your mouth.

436
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,667
And my friend, I'll do it...

437
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:33,751
disappear

438
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:37,417
and reappear far away.

439
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,251
I have to see that.

440
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:53,626
Copperfield, where is he?

441
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:58,834
I dream!

442
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,584
I'm going, take care of the fakir.

443
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,459
Come on, my bunny.

444
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,584
More stuffs.

445
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,001
I said "More stuffs".

446
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,251
Let's go.

447
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,584
A little last.

448
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,542
Put them back.

449
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,209
Like this?

450
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,209
No, you need these
documents for everyone.

451
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:27,126
Sir!

452
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:28,626
This is an error!

453
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,709
I am not part of this group.

454
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,459
This man is right.

455
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,001
He's telling the truth.

456
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:37,584
Nobody in this group
is in this group.

457
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,376
Please, I have to
go back to Paris.

458
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,501
Houdini, with me.

459
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,709
Sir!

460
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:49,209
It's yours?

461
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:53,542
How are you? My passport !

462
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,501
It was wrong.

463
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,209
But no!

464
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,542
Each his talent:
you hide people,

465
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,167
me, the fake passports.

466
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,334
It was my passport!

467
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:03,209
Do not quibble. And that ?

468
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,167
True?

469
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:05,209
False?

470
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:10,542
False.

471
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,376
Here's your pen,

472
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,292
your photos

473
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,501
and...

474
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:24,209
you can keep your
father's love letter.

475
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,251
This is very well written.

476
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:30,584
Poignant.

477
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,084
He believed in his bullshit.

478
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:34,459
Good.

479
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,501
Here's a map

480
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,417
of the world.

481
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:40,376
That...

482
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:42,751
it's England.

483
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:43,834
There is nothing.

484
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,334
Exact. Usually, there is a map.

485
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:48,792
I come here.

486
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,459
You are forbidden

487
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,292
here.

488
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:52,626
You,

489
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,167
forbidden

490
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,459
here.

491
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:58,001
Do you understand English?

492
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,751
- We only speak English.
- This is the procedure.

493
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,167
Where do you...

494
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,084
you...

495
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:04,834
where

496
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:07,334
Do you want to go?

497
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,126
Where?

498
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:09,501
In Paris!

499
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:15,792
If we send you back to France,
you'll be there in 8 days,

500
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,084
with a new name

501
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,876
on a new fake passport.

502
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,501
I do not want to live here.

503
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:22,001
The climate?

504
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:24,042
Too bad for you.

505
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:29,417
I'm going to ask you to
sign your statement.

506
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,501
But I did not do it.

507
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:33,501
I know, I know.

508
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:38,334
You speak seriously...

509
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:40,792
All right, go ahead.

510
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:43,376
I admit

511
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,334
Stayed in the Swedish
furniture store.

512
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,542
I was afraid of being
mistaken for a thief.

513
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:52,084
I hid in a closet,
it's my only crime.

514
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:54,501
My mother is still there, in a pot.

515
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:57,542
She is dead.
Afterwards, I met Marie.

516
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,376
You do not notice anything!

517
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,751
No, I prefer my testimony.

518
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:07,667
I make you a confidence.

519
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,292
We have a charter...

520
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,167
for Spain,

521
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:15,251
but none of our
stowaways come from it.

522
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,001
Please, can you send
me back to Paris?

523
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,542
I sing you the answer?

524
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:25,251
<i>I have a charter for Spain</i>

525
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:29,584
<i>I have to fill it with grip</i>

526
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:33,876
<i>You are persona non grata</i>

527
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,542
<i>You have to go to Barcelona</i>

528
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,042
<i>Once far</i>

529
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,792
<i>you abstain</i>

530
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:45,334
<i>return by bus or train</i>

531
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,042
It's impossible!

532
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,834
I have to go back to Paris.

533
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,501
<i>Re-write to me while singing</i>

534
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,042
What?

535
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:56,084
Sing it. We sing !

536
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,834
<i>Marie is waiting for me at the Eiffel Tower</i>

537
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,459
<i>It's not a date</i>

538
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,834
<i>But I will have flowers for her</i>

539
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,459
<i>Please, a little empathy</i>

540
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:09,376
<i>Help me get back to...</i>

541
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,167
<i>Paris</i>

542
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,709
<i>Protest</i>

543
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:15,334
<i>is useless</i>

544
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:19,459
<i>You will be able to see Andalusia</i>

545
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:23,209
<i>Malaga, Seville, Segovia</i>

546
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:27,459
<i>Eating tapas is a treat</i>

547
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,334
<i>And play tennis with Nadal</i>

548
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:31,792
I do not play tennis.

549
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,334
<i>This old man shakes his fan</i>

550
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,334
<i>Return it to the fold</i>

551
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:54,251
<i>These kids love churros</i>

552
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,501
<i>And hop, live in Burgos</i>

553
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,501
<i>This blonde looks like Shakira</i>

554
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,626
<i>Barcelona, she will love</i>

555
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:02,292
Shakira is from Colombia.

556
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,376
<i>These hips do not lie</i>

557
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,292
<i>That she returns to su casa</i>

558
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:10,459
<i>I repeat to you without
harghness You are all in Spain!</i>

559
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:18,751
Your papers?

560
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,001
On the side.

561
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:22,667
Go ahead.

562
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:25,042
Your papers.

563
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,126
I do not have any.

564
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,084
Are you Spanish?

565
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,167
Someone from Spain?

566
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:46,584
Someone has any
connection with Spain?

567
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:50,126
And you?

568
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:53,126
I am British.

569
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:54,751
I am Swiss.

570
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,626
Upon arrival in Barcelona,

571
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:03,501
there was a real war

572
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:05,459
between Captain Smith

573
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,542
and Inspector Fernandez.

574
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:11,917
- We will not tolerate your migrants...
- it is intolerable that your migrants...

575
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,417
Take them back.

576
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:17,167
We will not suffer the
consequences of your laxity.

577
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:18,292
Connects.

578
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:38,542
<i>We became the hostages of this conflict.</i>

579
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:43,292
<i>We were prisoners.</i>

580
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,542
<i>Tell me you regret</i>

581
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,751
to have slept on the first date.

582
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:06,584
Even if you do not call it
a date, for me it is one.

583
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:07,751
Alas, no.

584
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:12,001
Impossible to sleep with
someone who never came.

585
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,751
That's wrong.

586
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:16,834
With Snapchat, you can
post photos of your...

587
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:17,876
Rose.

588
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,917
And he takes a picture of his...

589
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:22,001
You've messed up again.

590
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:23,626
Why?

591
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,459
As your marriage aborted.

592
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,501
Do not talk about that.

593
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:28,001
Yes, I'll talk about it.

594
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:28,751
Stop.

595
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,834
<i>Too late, I started.</i>

596
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:34,167
You think too much, you complicate everything.

597
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,542
You're not funny.

598
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:38,751
Since the fiasco of your
marriage, you have become

599
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:39,834
<i>super boring.</i>

600
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,209
<i>Relax!</i>

601
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:43,834
Enjoy life. You're in Paris!

602
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:47,126
Become lesbian, like me.

603
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:48,292
You're not lesbian.

604
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,751
Yes, I am.

605
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,584
I love the way of life too much.

606
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,209
I will think about it.

607
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:08,501
Excuse me, can I ask
you a question?

608
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:10,501
My cell dropped me.

609
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:14,917
This is the Trocadero metro?

610
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,542
Thank you, it's great.

611
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:23,001
It's there.

612
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,751
Look at them.

613
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:40,167
And we say that life is right?

614
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:44,792
Why does chance always
favor the same?

615
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,084
Chance does not exist.

616
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:49,542
It's karma that counts.

617
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,292
Karma is the spell we deserve.

618
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,501
I must have been a real
jerk in another life.

619
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,501
Karma.

620
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,501
The media did not talk about us.

621
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,667
Everyone did not care.

622
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,584
We were stuck.

623
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,042
What did you do?

624
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:12,501
I worked on my karma.

625
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,292
<i>To return to Paris.</i>

626
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:18,167
Your name. Which is your name?

627
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,459
There are 4 different names.

628
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,209
I need ideas for the
cosmetics sector.

629
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:02,001
And from Monday,

630
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:05,501
Marie will be our new
Marketing Director.

631
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:08,917
Congratulations.

632
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:11,376
Another cheese.

633
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:17,459
That's way too much.

634
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,667
Yes, but we must celebrate.

635
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:26,876
Health.

636
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:30,584
To your well-deserved promotion, and...

637
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:32,667
And?

638
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:36,751
I decided to settle
in Paris permanently.

639
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:45,167
Permanent...

640
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,376
It's great, really.

641
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:57,001
Pieter moves to Paris.

642
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,584
Great.

643
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,751
Yes, it's great.

644
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,209
He's great.

645
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,792
My life is perfect.

646
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,917
Absolutely perfect.

647
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:09,667
Did I tell you

648
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:12,584
that he carried me in his arms

649
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:15,209
on the street because
my foot hurt?

650
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:18,417
Then he massaged my foot

651
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:21,459
so divinely soothing and...

652
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,501
when we go to the restaurant,

653
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:26,709
He speaks to the server
in his native language.

654
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,084
Can we talk about it tomorrow?

655
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:39,834
Finally, I may not be lesbian.

656
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:24,459
<i>Karma.</i>

657
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,084
<i>It works</i>

658
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,042
<i>every time.</i>

659
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:27,667
<i>In this confined space,</i>

660
00:43:28,584 --> 00:43:31,209
<i>I felt the irresistible
urge to write</i>

661
00:43:31,334 --> 00:43:33,501
<i>the story of Master Deva.</i>

662
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:36,251
<i>A very wise and wonderful man</i>

663
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:38,042
<i>that I met in prison.</i>

664
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:39,667
Have you gone to jail?

665
00:43:41,626 --> 00:43:42,876
Yes, buddy.

666
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,459
And I was younger than you.

667
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,751
<i>I was put in a tiny cell,
without bed or window.</i>

668
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,042
Bastard!

669
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,501
You will rot in hell!

670
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:02,042
Your mother must be weak for
having a draw like you!

671
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,334
You're soft of the brain!

672
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,001
You are coming out of the sewers.

673
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:06,501
You're a big pig!

674
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:07,834
Dirty cockroach!

675
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,876
Old mackerel!
Get me out of here!

676
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:15,584
I want to go home.

677
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:19,001
<i>After two weeks,</i>

678
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:21,251
<i>I was shaken by hunger,</i>

679
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:22,667
<i>loneliness</i>

680
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:27,001
<i>and the fear that my mother
never wants to see me again.</i>

681
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:35,251
Help me, my God!

682
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:36,667
Please!

683
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,917
It's been so long
since I'm in prison.

684
00:44:40,251 --> 00:44:43,001
I wonder what my cousins do.

685
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:52,667
Are you there for a long time?

686
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:53,876
I do not know.

687
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,459
I do not even have a window.

688
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,751
I have one.
I could tell you what I see.

689
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:06,084
Children play ball
in the street.

690
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:08,584
It's market day.

691
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,334
The sellers settle down.

692
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,292
A bronze woman on her balcony.

693
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:19,792
A mother brings water to
the children who play.

694
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:23,751
They argue to drink first.

695
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:28,126
Children play cricket
with sticks...

696
00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:30,792
I hear music in the distance.

697
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:34,417
They are messing!

698
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:38,792
There is a bearded young man
with beautiful bright eyes.

699
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,626
He is in love.

700
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,292
Do you hear the bird sing?

701
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,167
It looks like what?

702
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:47,917
Blue, red and yellow feathers.

703
00:45:48,084 --> 00:45:50,834
His eyes are like little olives.

704
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,584
You can go out.

705
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,042
Master Deva?

706
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:08,917
I can go out.

707
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:20,042
<i>For a very long time,</i>

708
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:23,292
<i>I thought I would never
see Master Deva again.</i>

709
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:28,667
Mom!

710
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:37,751
<i>Soon,</i>

711
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:40,542
<i>I was back in the street,</i>

712
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:42,251
<i>with my cousins.</i>

713
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:47,251
Aja?

714
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:51,167
Master Deva?

715
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:53,917
Aja, is it you?

716
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:04,167
Are you blind?

717
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,917
Yes, I am blind. It's nothing.

718
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:10,042
<i>His eyes did not see,</i>

719
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:13,459
<i>but he used his
imagination to see.</i>

720
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,751
<i>From my darkest days,</i>

721
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,084
<i>Master Deva had a
wonderful life lesson.</i>

722
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,501
Did you tell Alfredo
I was upset?

723
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:42,709
Yes, I told him

724
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:46,042
that you were extremely upset.

725
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:48,709
He knows I'm waiting in Paris?

726
00:47:50,376 --> 00:47:52,709
The reshoots will only last one day.

727
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:54,709
Lie.

728
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,209
He promised it.

729
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,501
One day only.

730
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:03,459
And Matthew called.

731
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:07,626
He sent you 3 emails and 22 text messages.

732
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:12,584
It will teach him to forget to
thank me at the Golden Globes.

733
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:19,042
And Mr. Burton asks if you have
read the scenario of the fairy tale

734
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:21,126
and if you would consider playing

735
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:22,792
the witch.

736
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,042
A witch.

737
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:29,376
The witch.

738
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:34,542
Get out all.

739
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:40,584
I hate Rome.

740
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:14,709
No need for a weapon.

741
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:18,084
What are you doing almost
naked in my trunk?

742
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,626
I only had my shirt to write.

743
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:23,251
I could not put it back.

744
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:24,459
Sorry.

745
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:25,417
A writer?

746
00:49:29,584 --> 00:49:31,459
I did not have paper.

747
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:35,584
Neither of papers.

748
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:37,001
A refugee?

749
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:45,584
I am a refugee.

750
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,376
Aja, it's really touching.

751
00:49:58,251 --> 00:49:59,251
Thank you.

752
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:03,042
Your story upset me,

753
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,209
but she also helped me
understand many things.

754
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:09,667
I sometimes feel blind,

755
00:50:09,792 --> 00:50:11,334
like your character.

756
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,334
Excuse me.

757
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:20,001
Good evening, Nelly.

758
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,876
My God, you are sublime.

759
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:25,876
Sublime, as always.

760
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:28,251
Alfredo, the director is an idiot.

761
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:32,751
Nelly, Michael Zhudovski
is not an idiot.

762
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,209
He's an idiot.

763
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:36,584
Yes, he's an idiot, but...

764
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:39,126
we must finish this film.

765
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:41,251
Otherwise, I'm ruined.

766
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:42,751
Please, help me.

767
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:44,584
He's an idiot, but...

768
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,334
Come and have dinner, then we'll go out.

769
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:48,334
We'll drink a glass, you and me.

770
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:49,626
We divorced.

771
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:50,584
Your decision!

772
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,084
Just 5 days of reshoots.

773
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:04,292
I dream. He is too young for you.

774
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:05,501
He is a writer

775
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:06,667
and an artist.

776
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:09,626
He wrote his last
work on his shirt.

777
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:11,584
Such as the old Sufi poets.

778
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:12,542
On his shirt?

779
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:13,751
He did not have paper.

780
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:17,167
A grandiose artistic gesture, no?

781
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,917
He took off his shirt

782
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,667
to write a story.

783
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:23,167
Why would we do that?

784
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:24,209
It's art.

785
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:25,251
Art?

786
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,751
Yes, art.

787
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:36,501
Nelly, it's not art.

788
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,001
Giancarlo wants to buy it.

789
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:45,376
Why are you talking to Giancarlo?
What does he want ?

790
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:46,751
He calls me.

791
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:48,292
Why?

792
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:49,542
He calls.

793
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:56,334
He wants to buy that?

794
00:51:56,459 --> 00:51:57,751
- How much?
- Secret.

795
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:00,417
How much does he pay for this damn shirt?

796
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:03,417
How much?

797
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:04,417
50.

798
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:07,001
50,000 for a shirt?

799
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,167
Good.

800
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,334
Let's get clothes up.

801
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,459
First trip to Paris?

802
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:32,167
No, I have been living here for 2 years.

803
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:39,334
Tell me what I can do to make
this trip more enjoyable.

804
00:52:39,834 --> 00:52:43,001
Do you want to chat,
know something?

805
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,459
I have a special gift.

806
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,751
I can read your future.

807
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,126
Driving?

808
00:52:52,376 --> 00:52:55,626
Some read the future
in tea leaves,

809
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,001
me, I read it in traffic.

810
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:03,501
And you see what?

811
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:10,667
There, right now, I
see a tormented past.

812
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:22,626
Two years ago, I put
the bazaar in my life.

813
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:24,667
There I am with a man

814
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:26,876
who is really nice.

815
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:29,917
Frankly, it could not be better.

816
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:31,501
He is creative,

817
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,917
it is beautiful,

818
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,834
he is sweet...

819
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:38,292
he creates flower gardens in Paris.

820
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:40,667
And he comes to live here for me.

821
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,876
There is a lot of traffic.

822
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:44,834
It means?

823
00:53:48,584 --> 00:53:49,917
There is another man.

824
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:51,667
No, no one else.

825
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:53,584
The circulation does not lie.

826
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:59,251
So, did you just kiss him once?

827
00:53:59,376 --> 00:54:01,917
I know, it's not much, but...

828
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:04,501
I think of her all the time.

829
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:06,917
It's love.

830
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:10,917
Yes, I think I'm in love.

831
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:14,334
Why divorcing Alfredo?

832
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,376
Why did you marry her, rather?

833
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:17,751
Why?

834
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:22,376
He was very handsome, exciting,

835
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:23,667
lovely,

836
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,542
powerful, rich...

837
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,667
seductive and dangerous.

838
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:31,209
Italians are very seductive.

839
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,251
He changed?

840
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:33,834
Not at all.

841
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:35,584
Hence the divorce.

842
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:46,376
I love this place.

843
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:54,209
It's moving

844
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,209
that these pieces
represent dreams

845
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,709
hundreds of people.

846
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,209
I love it.

847
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:05,251
A constellation of
hopes and dreams.

848
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,751
Make a wish.

849
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:16,084
I want money,

850
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:19,709
in throw seems counterproductive.

851
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:28,501
In my turn.

852
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:32,459
I wish that Thomas
Gregory forgive me.

853
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,042
Who is it?

854
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:36,792
Thomas Gregory.

855
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,501
It was the love of my life.

856
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:42,334
A long time ago.

857
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:46,001
Even today, I think
of him every day.

858
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,251
What happened?

859
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:48,876
I became famous.

860
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:50,834
I had an affair.

861
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:55,001
He learned it through the newspapers.

862
00:55:56,209 --> 00:55:57,876
It was on the first page

863
00:55:58,042 --> 00:56:00,459
of all the newspapers in the world.

864
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:11,292
So the reconciliation must
be equally spectacular.

865
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:10,501
What is your name?

866
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:11,459
Your name?

867
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:12,209
Aja!

868
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:14,167
Ajatashatru Lavash Patel.

869
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:15,792
Are you in a relationship?

870
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:20,001
No, she is in love with
an exceptional man,

871
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:21,542
Thomas Gregory.

872
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:33,084
I want the shirt!

873
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:34,209
No, Alfredo.

874
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,084
You do not appreciate art.

875
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:39,334
How can you say that?
I appreciate art!

876
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:51,459
It was promised to Giancarlo.

877
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:57,292
Why him?

878
00:59:57,417 --> 01:00:00,251
Why is it always Giancarlo?

879
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:08,459
How much do you offer?

880
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:11,376
100,000.  In liquid.

881
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:18,709
No, she is in love with an exceptional man,

882
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:55,209


883
01:00:55,334 --> 01:00:57,126
<i>Thomas Gregory.</i>

884
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,376
He called.

885
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,917
Thomas called.

886
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:13,626
How are you?

887
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:14,834
Very good.

888
01:02:15,292 --> 01:02:15,917
Very good.

889
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:18,792
It seems that Nelly is there.

890
01:02:20,501 --> 01:02:21,251
"It seems"?

891
01:02:21,376 --> 01:02:24,417
Maybe we could have
a drink together?

892
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,042
Of course.

893
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,042
Call me.

894
01:02:28,376 --> 01:02:29,292
Or Nelly.

895
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:31,417
That...

896
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:33,501
Can you talk to him?

897
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:34,876
Do you call him?

898
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:36,167
Nelly?

899
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:37,917
No

900
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:50,542
Sorry for the shirt.

901
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:54,501
What shirt?

902
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:56,542
The shirt-story.

903
01:02:57,709 --> 01:02:59,001
I bought it.

904
01:02:59,126 --> 01:03:01,751
But what are you talking about?

905
01:03:03,084 --> 01:03:04,042
I have to go.

906
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,209
Money.

907
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:31,126
Give me the money.

908
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:20,917
Moohini, where should I go?

909
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,209
<i>I flew over Rome,</i>

910
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:19,751
<i>direction Paris.</i>

911
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,501
<i>I even had provisions.</i>

912
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:39,001
<i>I had time to dream</i>

913
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:43,042
<i>to the fantastic life that I would
lead with the money I had earned.</i>

914
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:45,001
<i>Life was beautiful.</i>

915
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,459
I traveled for hours.

916
01:06:00,834 --> 01:06:02,626
It was beautiful.

917
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,667
The winds seemed perfect.

918
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:16,876
I am rich!

919
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,542
I am rich...

920
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:44,917
and I'm going to die.

921
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:52,709
Here the Minister of Commerce of India.

922
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:54,584
I must speak to Mary.

923
01:07:54,709 --> 01:07:57,167
- <i> She's missing.</i>
- <i> It's an emergency.</i>

924
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:10,626
She takes a shower.

925
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:11,792
It's Ajatashatru.

926
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:14,417
You planted it at the Eiffel Tower.

927
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:19,251
Yes, but...
Can I leave a message?

928
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:27,459
I'm sorry I missed it
at the Eiffel Tower.

929
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:31,876
Exceptional circumstances
have complicated things.

930
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:34,709
<i>I may never be able
to call her back.</i>

931
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:36,001
Never.

932
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:39,584
We only saw each other once...

933
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:42,209
but our kiss was a promise.

934
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:44,917
<i>Tell him...</i>

935
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,501
She's coming?

936
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:57,584
If she does not hear
from me, tell her...

937
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:01,292
that...

938
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:03,334
that I love him.

939
01:09:05,376 --> 01:09:08,292
And I will always love him.

940
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:09,417
I love it!

941
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:10,542
She met someone.

942
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:15,042
<i>And yesterday, they decided
to settle together.</i>

943
01:09:17,126 --> 01:09:18,626
Can I change my message?

944
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:19,876
Go ahead.

945
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:23,834
No message.

946
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:49,126
<i>Aja, your life is a mess.</i>

947
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,751
<i>Re-form yourself</i>

948
01:09:50,876 --> 01:09:52,251
<i>and go quickly to Paris!</i>

949
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:54,126
<i>Listen to your mother, for once.</i>

950
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:55,417
I know.

951
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:59,167
Just when my life
is back on track,

952
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,501
just when I have enough money

953
01:10:04,584 --> 01:10:07,709
to hope to lead a decent life,

954
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:12,834
just when love seems possible...

955
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:17,251
I am condemned to a terrible death.

956
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:20,126
What is this karma?

957
01:10:20,251 --> 01:10:23,792
<i>Do not blame your
karma, take your life!</i>

958
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:24,876
How?

959
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:27,459
<i>You are the master of your life,</i>

960
01:10:27,584 --> 01:10:29,584
<i>not chance, nor karma.</i>

961
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,584
Now, tell me.

962
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,251
What's in your briefcase?

963
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:05,001
Long story.

964
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:06,626
I have plenty of time.

965
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:08,542
I'm trying to go to Paris.

966
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:14,751
You're not ready to be there.

967
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:16,584
We are going to Libya.

968
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:23,626
And what are you so precious

969
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:25,501
in the briefcase that you cuddle?

970
01:11:26,542 --> 01:11:28,126
It's just...

971
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,251
of...

972
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:31,292
personal effects.

973
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:35,501
Of course.

974
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:37,501
Open it.

975
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:39,167
Why?

976
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:41,751
Open the briefcase.

977
01:11:41,876 --> 01:11:42,917
Another gun!

978
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:44,376
The Indian...

979
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,501
open the briefcase!

980
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,334
<i>At this point,</i>

981
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:59,417
<i>I appealed to all
my magical powers</i>

982
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:01,501
<i>to make the money invisible.</i>

983
01:12:02,876 --> 01:12:04,667
Open the briefcase!

984
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:34,834
<i>It was in Libya that all
refugees ended up arriving</i>

985
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:37,042
<i>at one time or another.</i>

986
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:47,292
What are you doing in Africa?

987
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:48,917
And you?

988
01:12:49,126 --> 01:12:51,626
The country of milk and
honey does not want me.

989
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:54,501
But thanks again.

990
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:58,542
I need your help

991
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:01,542
There were several
illegal refugee camps.

992
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:03,501
All people in transit.

993
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:07,334
I knew where the money was.

994
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:11,917
<i>So I asked Wiraj to help
me get my briefcase.</i>

995
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:13,917
<i>It was my money.</i>

996
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:16,042
<i>I had won.</i>

997
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:18,876
<i>No way I let this thief</i>

998
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:20,501
<i>steal my property.</i>

999
01:13:20,834 --> 01:13:22,667
I know where my money is hidden.

1000
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:26,917
But listen: no violence.

1001
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,542
Understood?

1002
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:32,459
Fayçal, no violence.

1003
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:37,042
Thank you.

1004
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,501
Thank you very much.

1005
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:56,209
I want to go back to see my wife.

1006
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,834
Ugly as you are, you have a wife?

1007
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:01,376
She does not care about my physique.

1008
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:06,001
The hippopotamus is as
pretty as the deer,

1009
01:14:06,126 --> 01:14:08,251
in the eyes of his wife.

1010
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:29,126
It shows that he is afraid, raise it!

1011
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:33,251
This moron thinks he bluffed me!

1012
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:38,667
Shut up and put the money on the table!
Money!

1013
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:46,709
Look at this!

1014
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,667
What are you doing?

1015
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:31,251
Too violent?

1016
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:32,584
Sorry.

1017
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,042
Good evening, Aja.

1018
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:35,792
Unfortunately,

1019
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:37,917
tonight I'm really

1020
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:39,917
very bad mood.

1021
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:45,084
Perfect. Let's go.

1022
01:15:56,209 --> 01:15:57,501
So...

1023
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:01,084
how much do I owe you,
to you and to others?

1024
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:05,126
How much are you in?

1025
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:10,792
2,000.  As you know, we are all in transit.

1026
01:16:14,834 --> 01:16:18,209
And many are fleeing the war.

1027
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:21,251
How much?

1028
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:24,084
Wisnel lost his wife two years ago in Mali.

1029
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:30,251
How much?

1030
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:33,167
On this side, Aziz...

1031
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:36,167
must go to Germany, find his twin brother.

1032
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:40,251
So, how much?

1033
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:44,084
Emel, there...

1034
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,709
She was assaulted by soldiers during the war.

1035
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:49,251
One of her friends in
Brussels has a bakery.

1036
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:51,501
She will have work,
if she arrives there.

1037
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:55,126


1038
01:17:00,084 --> 01:17:01,834
They all have a dream.

1039
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:04,501
I understand.

1040
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:08,709
Give what feels right to you.

1041
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:29,001
Some of my brothers and
sisters helped me last night.

1042
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:32,917
All who have a hope or a dream,

1043
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:36,042
form a line.

1044
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:39,542
I may be able to help you.

1045
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:46,376
What do you want?

1046
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,167
Have a boat...

1047
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:51,084
to go fishing

1048
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,126
at sea,

1049
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,834
to make money for my family.

1050
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:57,917
It seems very reasonable.

1051
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:07,292
Buy your boat.

1052
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:09,626
Feed your family.

1053
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:20,501
Look!

1054
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:25,709
Tell me.

1055
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:29,834
I need a plane
ticket to Brussels.

1056
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:32,084
I want to learn how to make chocolate.

1057
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:45,459
Good luck.

1058
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:52,459
<i>And then, it happened.</i>

1059
01:18:53,459 --> 01:18:55,126
<i>Can not stop.</i>

1060
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:57,876
<i>I was invaded by a
feeling of well-being,</i>

1061
01:18:58,042 --> 01:19:01,251
<i>as if a pretty little pink cloud</i>

1062
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:03,251
<i>had popped up in my chest</i>

1063
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:05,584
<i>and irradiated my whole body.</i>

1064
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:08,751
In front of all these refugees,

1065
01:19:09,751 --> 01:19:13,417
I managed the most fabulous
of my magic tricks.

1066
01:19:13,876 --> 01:19:15,501
What did you do?

1067
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:19,917
I turned 2,000 into an
inexhaustible flow of money.

1068
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:21,709
Back home,

1069
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:26,709
they all told the story of
Ajatashatru Lavash Patel.

1070
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:48,376
<i>There, I understood
what I really wanted.</i>

1071
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:50,834
I wanted to go home to India.

1072
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:55,042
I just had enough for
my plane tickets

1073
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,417
and a real fake passport.

1074
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:03,459
<i>But first, I had one
important thing to do.</i>

1075
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,542
Glad to have met you.

1076
01:20:06,376 --> 01:20:07,792
Me too. Take care of yourself.

1077
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:10,209
Have a good trip.

1078
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:34,459
Start, fast!

1079
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,667
My dough!

1080
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:17,584
Honey, I'm sorry.

1081
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:20,542
I'm late, traffic was crazy.

1082
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:29,042
I kill myself at work all day,

1083
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,667
is it too much to ask
that dinner be ready?

1084
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:42,792
It makes me happy to see you.

1085
01:21:45,584 --> 01:21:47,459
It makes me happy too.

1086
01:21:49,126 --> 01:21:49,876
Mary,

1087
01:21:50,126 --> 01:21:51,542
I found the chair.

1088
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:52,542
Super.

1089
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,126
Pieter, this is Aja.

1090
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:58,376
Hello.

1091
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,376
See you soon.

1092
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:32,417
54.

1093
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:34,542
This is given, for
a fabulous mother.

1094
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:51,626
<i>Following this journey so difficult,</i>

1095
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:54,542
<i>I finally understood
what I wanted in life.</i>

1096
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:55,834
Moohini!

1097
01:22:57,084 --> 01:22:58,501
You're still here.

1098
01:22:58,626 --> 01:22:59,792
How are you?

1099
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:07,709
Welcome, Aja.

1100
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:11,126
<i>I finally managed to find
an agreement with Giri</i>

1101
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:14,501
<i>to repay what he
thought I owed him.</i>

1102
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,501
<i>Then I started teaching.</i>

1103
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,709
<i>Every morning, these kids come</i>

1104
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,001
<i>and I tell them stories.</i>

1105
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:30,459
<i>And I make sure that their world</i>

1106
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:32,209
<i>is enlarged</i>

1107
01:23:32,334 --> 01:23:35,459
<i>and they understand
that they are not poor.</i>

1108
01:23:35,542 --> 01:23:38,501
The great poet
Rabindranath Tagore wrote:

1109
01:23:39,084 --> 01:23:41,167
"How can we cross the sea

1110
01:23:41,501 --> 01:23:42,876
" by being satisfied

1111
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:44,459
"to watch it?"

1112
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:02,542
Boys, think about what he means.

1113
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:05,709
Sorry, I'm bothering you.

1114
01:24:13,459 --> 01:24:15,167
I promised.

1115
01:24:25,084 --> 01:24:27,209
Have you still fucked
your fiance in church?

1116
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:37,417
Maybe I should not have come.

1117
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,167
Go back to your place.

1118
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:55,542
And that's the end of the story.

1119
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:57,292
Any questions?

1120
01:24:59,126 --> 01:25:00,417
What is lesbian?

1121
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:06,501
Someone who loves a woman.

1122
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:08,542
So can I be?

1123
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:14,917
Yes.

1124
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:18,626
Why did you say at first
that it was a tragedy?

1125
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:27,292
You will spend 4 years in prison.

1126
01:25:28,501 --> 01:25:29,459
That...

1127
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,292
This is a terrible tragedy.

1128
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:37,542
You will lose four of the most
beautiful years of your life.

1129
01:25:42,501 --> 01:25:43,209
Unless...

1130
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:48,251
you take this opportunity.

1131
01:25:48,501 --> 01:25:49,584
What opportunity?

1132
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,501
If you come to my
school every day,

1133
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:01,709
you will not go to jail.

1134
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:04,584
That's right?

1135
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:06,126
That's right.

1136
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,126
Every day.

1137
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,334
Every day.

1138
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:18,376
Thanks, Aja.

1139
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,001
And your mom?

1140
01:26:25,709 --> 01:26:27,584
It's nice to ask.

1141
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:33,126
She is where she
always wanted to be.

1142
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:02,542
It was a true story?

1143
01:28:05,084 --> 01:28:07,209
Only important passages.
