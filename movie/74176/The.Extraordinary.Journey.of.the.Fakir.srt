You mistake...

Because you feeling guilty for having sex on your first date,
第一次约会就上床会有罪恶感

619

就算那样,那连个人影都没见跟谁上床

620
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,751
Technically, that's not true.

Why?
为什么这么说?

627
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,459
It's like your aborted marriage.

You're a stick-in-the-mud.
你真是自讨无趣

634

Ever since the marriage fiasco,

you've become the most boring person in the world

You should become a lesbian, like me.

I'll think about it.

Excuse me, I'm sorry. Um...Can I ask you something?

My phone just die.

654
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,084
There is no such thing as chance.

655
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:49,542

你箱子里有啥宝贝? 抱得这么紧

1033
01:11:26,542 --> 01:11:28,126
It's just some...
只不过是...

1034
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,251
some of...

1035
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:31,292
personal necessities.

1036
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:35,501
Of course.

1037
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:37,501
Open it.

1038
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:39,167
Why? It's just some...

1039
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:41,751
Open the briefcase.

1040
01:11:41,876 --> 01:11:42,917
What's with all the guns!

1041
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:44,250
Indian,

1042
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,800
open the briefcase!

1043
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,561
Okay.

1044
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:56,334
<i>At that very moment,</i>

1045
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:59,417
<i>I summoned
all my magical powers</i>

1046
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:01,501
<i>to make the money
invisible.</i>

1047
01:12:02,876 --> 01:12:04,667
Open the briefcase!

1048
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:34,834
<i>Libya had become the place that
it seemed all refugees ended up</i>

1049
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:37,042
<i>at one point or another.</i>

1050
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:39,913
Aja.

1051
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:41,828
Aja!

1052
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:47,292
What are you doing in Africa, man?

1053
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:48,917
What are you doing here?

1054
01:12:49,126 --> 01:12:51,626
Unfortunately, they don't want me
in the land of the milk and honey.

1055
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:54,501
But I want to thank you.

1056
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:58,542
I need your help.

1057
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:01,542
There were several
clandestine refugee camps.

1058
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:03,501
All people in transit.

1059
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:07,334
I knew where the money was.

1060
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:11,917
<i>So I asked Wiraj if they could
help me get my briefcase back.</i>

1061
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:13,917
<i>That was my money.</i>

1062
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:16,042
<i>I had earned it.</i>

1063
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:18,876
<i>There was no way
I would left the thief</i>

1064
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:20,501
<i>steal my earnings.</i>

1065
01:13:20,834 --> 01:13:22,667
I know exactly where my money is.

1066
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:26,917
OK, but everyone,
no violence.

1067
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,542
Understood?

1068
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:32,459
Faysal,
no violence.

1069
01:13:35,834 --> 01:13:37,042
Thank you.

1070
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,501
Thank you very much.

1071
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:56,209
I want to go back to my wife.

1072
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,834
How does someone
as ugly as you get a wife?

1073
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:01,376
She doesn't care about the looks.

1074
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:06,001
The hippo,
is as pretty as the gazelle,

1075
01:14:06,126 --> 01:14:08,251
in the eyes of his wife.

1076
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:29,126
You can tell he's scared.
Raise it!

1077
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:33,251
This moron thinks he can bluff me!

1078
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:38,667
Shut up and put the money on the table!
The money!

1079
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:46,709
Look at this!

1080
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,667
What are you doing?

1081
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:31,251
- Too violent?
- Yes.

1082
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:32,584
Sorry.

1083
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:34,042
Good evening, Aja.

1084
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:35,792
Unfortunately,

1085
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:39,917
tonight I'm in a very,
very bad mood.

1086
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:45,084
Perfect. Let's go.

1087
01:15:56,209 --> 01:15:57,501
So,

1088
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:01,084
how much do I owe you,
and others?

1089
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:05,126
How much is in the briefcase?

1090
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:12,092
- €2,000.
- €2,000!?

1091
01:16:14,834 --> 01:16:18,209
Well, as you know,
we're all in transit.

1092
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:20,751
Many are running from the war?

1093
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:21,661
Okay...

1094
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:24,084
How much?

1095
01:16:25,459 --> 01:16:30,251
Whitman, lost his wife,
two years ago, in Mali.

1096
01:16:30,534 --> 01:16:31,334
Okay...

1097
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:33,167
How much?

1098
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:36,167
This side, Aziz,

1099
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:40,251
must get to Germany
to find his twin brother.

1100
01:16:40,718 --> 01:16:41,518
Okay...

1101
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:44,084
So, how...
How much?

1102
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,709
Emel, there,
Emel.

1103
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:49,251
She was attacked by soldiers
during the war.

1104
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:51,501
A friend of her is in Brussels
owns bakery.

1105
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:55,126
So she has a job waiting for her
only if she can get there.

1106
01:17:00,084 --> 01:17:01,834
Everyone of them has a dream.

1107
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:04,501
I understand.

1108
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:08,709
Give... what feels right.

1109
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:29,001
A few of my brothers and sisters
helped me last night.

1110
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:32,917
Anyone with a hope or a dream,

1111
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:36,042
please stand in line.

1112
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:39,542
I may be able to help you.

1113
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:46,376
What is your wish?

1114
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,167
To have a boat...

1115
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:51,084
so I can go fish

1116
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,126
at the sea to...

1117
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,834
to earn money
for my family.

1118
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:57,917
That seems very reasonable.

1119
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:07,292
Buy your boat.

1120
01:18:08,334 --> 01:18:09,626
Feed your family.

1121
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:20,501
Look!

1122
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:25,709
Tell me.

1123
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:29,834
I need a plane ticket
to Brussels.

1124
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:32,084
I want to learn
how to make chocolate.

1125
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:39,037
There you go.

1126
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:43,763
Thank you.

1127
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:45,659
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1128
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:52,459
<i>And then, it happened.</i>

1129
01:18:53,459 --> 01:18:55,126
<i>I couldn't stop.</i>

1130
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:57,876
<i>I was overcome by
a feeling of well-being,</i>

1131
01:18:58,042 --> 01:19:01,251
<i>as if a lady in the clear vapor cloud</i>

1132
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:03,251
<i>had appeared inside my chest</i>

1133
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:05,584
<i>and was spreading
throughout my body.</i>

1134
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:08,751
In front of all these refugees,

1135
01:19:09,751 --> 01:19:13,417
I succeeded in creating
my greatest magic trick, ever.

1136
01:19:13,876 --> 01:19:15,501
How is that?

1137
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:19,917
I transformed €2,000 into
a never ending flow of money.

1138
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:21,709
People went back to their villages,

1139
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:26,709
and everyone told the story of
Ajatashatru Lavash Patel.

1140
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:48,376
<i>Right then, I understood
what I really wanted.</i>

1141
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:50,834
I wanted to
come home to India.

1142
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:55,042
I had just enough money
to buy my plane ticket

1143
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,417
and a real fake passport.

1144
01:19:59,767 --> 01:20:03,459
<i>But first, I had
one last important thing to do.</i>

1145
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,542
It's nice meeting you Aja.

1146
01:20:06,376 --> 01:20:07,792
Likewise.
Take care, man.

1147
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:10,209
Safe trip.

1148
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:34,459
Go, quick!

1149
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,667
My money!

1150
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:17,584
Honey, I'm sorry.

1151
01:21:17,792 --> 01:21:20,542
I'm late.
Traffic was terrible.

1152
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:29,042
God damn-it,
I slaved away all day at work,

1153
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,667
is it really too much
to ask for dinner to be ready?

1154
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:42,792
It's lovely to see you.

1155
01:21:45,584 --> 01:21:47,459
It's lovely to see you too.

1156
01:21:49,126 --> 01:21:49,876
Marie,

1157
01:21:50,126 --> 01:21:51,542
I found the deck chair.

1158
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:52,542
Oh, great.

1159
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:56,717
Pieter, this is Aja.
Aja, this is Pieter.

1160
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:58,376
Hi.

1161
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:02,718
Hi.

1162
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,376
I'll see you soon.

1163
01:22:07,352 --> 01:22:08,152
Yeah.

1164
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:32,417
€54, please.

1165
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:34,542
<i>This is a good deal
for a fabulous mother.</i>

1166
01:22:36,587 --> 01:22:37,587
Thank you.

1167
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:51,626
<i>Only after this very difficult journey</i>

1168
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:54,542
<i>that I realized
what I wanted in life.</i>

1169
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:55,834
Moohini!

1170
01:22:57,084 --> 01:22:58,501
You're still here.

1171
01:22:58,626 --> 01:22:59,892
How are you?
Wait...

1172
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:07,709
Welcome home, Aja.

1173
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:11,126
<i>Eventually, I succeeding in
reaching a deal with Giri</i>

1174
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:14,501
<i>to pay back the money he believed
I still owed him.</i>

1175
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,501
<i>Then I started teaching.</i>

1176
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:24,709
<i>Each morning, these kids show up</i>

1177
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,001
<i>and I tell them stories.</i>

1178
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:32,209
<i>And I make sure
their world becomes a bit bigger</i>

1179
01:23:32,334 --> 01:23:35,459
<i>and they understand
they are not poor.</i>

1180
01:23:35,542 --> 01:23:38,501
The great poet
Rabindranath Tagore writes,

1181
01:23:39,084 --> 01:23:43,959
"How can you cross the sea
by merely standing and staring at it?"

1182
01:23:44,863 --> 01:23:45,663
What...

1183
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:57,969
Well...

1184
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:02,442
You boys, just think
what he means by that.

1185
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:03,267
I'm sorry.

1186
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:05,511
- I'm disturbing you.
- No, no.

1187
01:24:13,459 --> 01:24:15,167
I did promise.

1188
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:26,809
Did you leave your fiancé
at the altar again?

1189
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:37,417
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

1190
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,167
Go back to your seats.
Now!

1191
01:24:50,554 --> 01:24:51,354
Go!

1192
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:55,542
And that
is the end of the story.

1193
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:57,292
Any questions?

1194
01:24:59,126 --> 01:25:00,417
What's a lesbian?

1195
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:06,501
Someone who loves a woman.

1196
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:08,542
So I can be a lesbian?

1197
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:11,837
Well...

1198
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:14,917
Yes.

1199
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:18,626
Why did you say at the beginning
that this story was a tragedy?

1200
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:27,292
You're going to prison
for four years.

1201
01:25:28,501 --> 01:25:31,292
That...
is a terrible tragedy.

1202
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:37,542
You are going to lose
four of the best years of your life.

1203
01:25:42,501 --> 01:25:43,209
Unless...

1204
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:48,251
you seize this opportunity.

1205
01:25:48,501 --> 01:25:49,584
What opportunity?

1206
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,501
If you come to my
school every day,

1207
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:01,709
you don't have to go to prison.

1208
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:04,584
Really?

1209
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:06,126
Really.

1210
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:07,719
- Yes!
- Yes?

1211
01:26:08,269 --> 01:26:09,269
- Yes.
- Yes?

1212
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,180
Yeah.

1213
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,126
Every day.

1214
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,334
- Every day.
- Every day.

1215
01:26:14,621 --> 01:26:15,421
Every day.

1216
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:16,971
Every day.

1217
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:18,376
Thank you, Aja.

1218
01:26:22,419 --> 01:26:23,219
Aja,

1219
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,001
what about your mother?

1220
01:26:25,709 --> 01:26:27,584
Thank you so much for asking.

1221
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:33,126
My mother is where
she always wanted to be.

1222
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:02,542
Was that a true story?

1223
01:28:05,084 --> 01:28:07,209
Only the important parts.
