1
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,782
Spare some change?

2
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:49,002
Come on!

5
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,339
If you wanna make my money, you gotta get rougher than this. 

6
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,307
Hey! Hey you!

7
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,776
You wanna get in on this?

8
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,144
Come on.

9
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,879
Ten dollars.

10
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,114
Ten dollars.
Come on!  

11
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,517
Hey, fuck you then!

12
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,453
You'll never make
money without me.

13
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,655
Alright, alright   
let's see some blood.

14
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,761
That's it.
That's it.

16
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,280
Go, damn it!

17
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,949
Help me,
they're coming after me!

18
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,851
Please!

19
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,088
Lady, please help me,
get this off me!   

20
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,889
They're gonna fucking kill me.

21
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,758
You've gotta help me here!

22
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,761
Please, get this off my neck.

23
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,564
Get back, don't leave me!

24
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,599
Fuck.

25
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,508
You!

27
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,076
Please you've   
gotta help me here.

28
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,579
If you don't help me my hand's
coming off my fucking body. 

29
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,781
Please just untie me,
that's it.     

30
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,299
Oh brother of mine.

33
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,369
Look at you now.

34
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,071
Boys. This isn't
a joke anymore.

35
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,572
You weren't planning on
leaving town without  

36
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,808
saying goodbye, were ya?

37
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,344
Yeah, we've been looking
all over for you.   

38
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,979
I was gettin' worried.      

39
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,113
I'm your uncle.

40
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,648
I've known you since  
you were fuckin' babies!

41
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,417
This cocksucker gave me the 
shittiest Christmas presents.

42
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,720
I hate Christmas.

43
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,955
You fucking brats!
Fuck off!    

44
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,924
Drake, stop this,
we're family!  

45
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,559
It's the rules, Logan.     

46
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,896
You're our lucky contestant.

47
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,199
No, please.

48
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,534
Don't put me in there.

49
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,702
Show 'em how to play, boys.

50
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,404
Slick. You were always my favorite nephew.

51
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,672
I swear to God
I mean that. 

52
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:09,042
Get your feet in that
fucking deathhole!  

53
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,944
Fuck!  

54
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,885
Ivan, my boy.

57
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,955
I want everybody here
to appreciate this. 

58
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,226
Time to get the show
on the road boy-yo. 

59
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,063
All right, you fucking androids.

61
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,166
My father's got something
he wants you all to see. 

62
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,838
And I swear, anybody looks
away for even a second,  

63
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,307
I'll make them wish they
were fucking aborted. 

64
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,377
Ladies and gentlemen,  
welcome to the Drake Show.

65
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,047
Tonight's special episode
is going to be filled with

66
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,785
thrills, and chills, and 
my own personal favorite.

67
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,687
Lots and lots of that red shit 

68
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,724
that flows inside
all our bodies. 

69
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,628
Ivan?

70
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,863
Cheer, you fuckers!

71
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,399
Thank you.

74
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,203
How can you watch  
and not do anything?

76
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,938
They're going to   
fucking kill me here!

77
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,708
Somebody say something!
Don't just stand there!

78
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,110
You know, ever since our 
mother brought Logan home

79
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,647
from the hospital, I knew
he was a fucking coward. 

80
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,917
I'll leave town!

82
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,886
You'll never fucking
see me again.   

83
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,288
Just please, I can't
feel my legs, Drake.

84
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,856
He wants mercy from the Drake.

85
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,491
From the Drake.

86
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,394
And he should know  
better than anybody...

87
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,062
mercy ain't my style.

88
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,631
What do you want from me?

89
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,901
Logan is no longer my brother.

90
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,570
Our relationship 
has been severed.

91
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,174
And now he's all  
alone in this world,

92
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,777
with nothing but a

93
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,248
barbed wire noose
around his neck.

94
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,850
You can't let him
do this!     

95
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,451
It's not just my
life he's ruining.

96
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,053
Please. 
Help me.

97
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,521
Please!

98
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,790
You should have started 
beggin' a long time ago.

99
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:06,026
I've never enjoyed
listening to you

100
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,595
as much as I do right now.

101
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,130
You're a fucking animal, Drake!

102
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,632
You're a shitty fucking
weird little animal.  

103
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:17,137
The way I see it, I'm a
fucking miracle worker,

104
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,407
because I am going
to make it rain! 

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,042
Gun it,
Slick! 

106
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,099
Well, can you feel
your legs now?  

109
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,200
Can ya?
Huh!  

110
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,436
Was there something else
you wanted to say to me?

111
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,708
Well, thanks for tuning
in ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,476
Who knows,  
maybe next time

114
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,214
one of you will be  
our lucky contestant.

115
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,683
Enjoy the ride,     
my favorite fuckin' uncle.

116
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,388
Go the fuck home everybody!

118
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,057
And don't forget  
to wash your dicks!

119
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,480
$49.99.

122
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,622
Ugh.

125
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,394
I dare you to lick his dick.

127
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,401
Woo! Woo! 

129
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,076
You bastards!

131
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,815
Hey Slick, you gotta
check this out man. 

134
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,216
Fuckin awesome.

135
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,491
Hey, where the   
fuck are you going?

137
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,127
Business with dad.

138
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,916
Ah.  

139
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,519
Hey Otis.     
What are ya playing?

140
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,687
I forgot Slick.

141
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,389
I spent all my   
money in the arcade.

142
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,324
You owe me money.

143
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,526
You're burning me, Otis.      

144
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,728
Let me call my mom! I can
get my allowance early! 

145
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:19,565
That must be some  
hell of an allowance.

146
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,869
Come on man,
he's a kid,

147
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,904
let it slide.

148
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,845
What did you say to me?

149
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,714
You heard me.
Let it slide.

150
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,816
Sh-sh-sh...

151
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,819
The only thing    
I'm gonna let slide,

152
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,323
is my dick in your pussy.

153
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,797
Hey, Otie-
where ya going?

154
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,165
Don't hurt me, Ivan!

155
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,733
Shut the fuck up!

156
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,473
Did that hurt?

159
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,741
No.

160
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,310
You want to know how to
never feel pain again? 

161
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,745
No I don't want any more!

162
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,047
Does everybody wanna know

163
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,116
how to never  
feel pain again?

164
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,253
Come on Otis!

166
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,457
Have at it!

167
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,222
You know how I can tell
I'm making you wet?

169
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,556
No.

170
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,960
Cause you're making
my dick thirsty.  

171
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,902
What are you supposed to be?

172
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,271
Some kind of bad ass 
murderer or something?

173
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,606
Why?

174
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,374
Does that frighten you?

175
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,111
If you've got money to    
spend, nothing frightens me.

176
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,713
Baby, I've got all 
kinds of money with

177
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,716
your name written
all over it.   

178
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,452
Well what are 
you waiting for?

179
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,320
Let's go.

180
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,256
Awesome.

181
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,442
Nobody messes  
with you, do they?

182
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,578
Not if they give a
fuck about living.

183
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,548
So how many people
have you killed?  

184
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,851
What am I?   
A mathematician?

185
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,186
You're sexy...

186
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,554
You're fucking right.

187
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,489
Are we gonna fuck,
or what?     

188
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,204
What the hell?

189
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,005
That's your ride, bitch.
Come on.        

190
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,941
This was not   
our fucking deal!

191
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,843
I'm paying you good money.
You're gonna love this! 

192
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,480
Let the girl go, punk.

193
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,750
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

194
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,989
And who the fuck are you?

196
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,525
Put the knife away, kid

197
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,861
or I'll use it to 
cut welfare checks

198
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,063
from your rotten skin.

199
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,332
Well you better cut 
one to Mother Theresa

200
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,867
so you can give it
to her while she's

201
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,269
finger banging you in hell.

202
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,906
Shut your filthy mouth!

204
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,375
Mother Theresa is
a Goddamn saint!

205
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,482
Serves you right.

206
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,684
What did you think?

207
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,120
He was gonna put a 
ring on your finger?

208
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,115
Lock him up with
the Sodomites. 

211
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:33,886
And get me the Goddamned
chief of police now.   

212
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,935
Good day, sir.

213
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,470
No, no please,
take a seat. 

214
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,908
I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

215
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,511
Let me guess, you  
rode in on the rail?

216
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,446
That's right.

217
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,016
So I understand you've been
having a little bit

218
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,253
of difficulty with one
of our young men.  

219
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,857
Well, I think you're gonna
need a lot of dump trucks.

221
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,893
Dump trucks?

222
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,328
I don't follow you.

223
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,029
You get out there,  
get all the criminals,

224
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,164
put 'em in dump trucks.

225
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,767
Take em to a landfill
site and bury them. 

226
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,036
Put 'em in the ground.

227
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,471
I'm not too sure

228
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,074
I know what you're trying
to say here, sir.

229
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,376
What I'm trying
to say is that 

230
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:35,548
people don't go bad
like they do here. 

231
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,117
Look, if I'm being honest,

232
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,153
I can't argue with
anything you say.

233
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,956
Crime in this city has 
become an embarrassment.

234
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,826
I've been suspecting
some of my boys  

235
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,861
are working with Drake.

236
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:56,602
Some of my officers are giving
that maniac a free reign? 

237
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,905
So thank God for honest
people like yourself. 

238
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,808
You better get those officers and send them packing.

239
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:07,213
And start this whole   
operation all over again.

240
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,448
Between you and me, I'd love
to bring a wrecking ball  

241
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,283
down on Drake

242
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,120
but he might as     
well be king around here!

243
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,655
Kings fall.

244
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,190
You ought to read a
history book, Chief.

245
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,458
Now I gave you this
little bastard,  

246
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,127
put him away for life.

247
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,797
Well, we'll certainly see 
what we can do about that.

248
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,534
By the way, did...  

249
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,337
anybody officially   
welcome you to town yet?

250
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,738
They never do.

251
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,040
Well...

252
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,876
welcome to Fuck Town.

253
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,247
Hold still,   
you slimy maggot!

254
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,419
Get off me!

255
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,488
These two are the  
princes of Fuck Town!

256
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,257
Any idea what we should do with him, Slick?  

257
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,026
Yeah,     
hold him still.

258
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,063
Ah!

259
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,398
I'm gonna carve a
billboard into his chest.

260
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,400
You better get that
knife away from me!

261
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,505
Easy Slick, I think you
might be hurting him. 

262
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,740
God, Jesus God, boys.

263
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,043
What ever happened to
delicacy and finesse?

264
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,813
This is so you'll    
never forget what you are.

265
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,985
I thought this was
a police station.

266
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,788
Not a fucking circus.

267
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,093
I just wanted to help.

268
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,332
Ah!

270
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,071
And don't forget you 
fucking piece of shit,

272
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,975
every day is garbage day 
for street trash like you.

273
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,463
Hey.

274
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,931
You're so hot,

275
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,500
you make me want   
to cut my dick off and

276
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,136
rub it all over
your titties. 

277
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,171
Why don't you just calm down

278
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,773
and tell me what  
you're looking for?

279
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,808
I was hoping to
keep it a surprise.

280
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,577
I've had enough 
surprises tonight.

281
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,613
Quit wasting my time.

282
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,680
What's it gonna be?

283
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,216
Come on Abby, 
I'm a regular.

284
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,886
Baby, nothing about you is regular.  

285
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,121
Hey, look, I'm the
one with the money

286
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:33,325
and you're the one
selling your hole.

287
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,228
I know that sweetie,

288
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,330
I'd love to take your money.

289
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,699
So why don't you just   
tell me what you're after?

290
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,001
Fuck it.

291
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,904
Just give me the
regular, plus 10%.

292
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,238
Okay.

293
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,707
I'm gonna make you love
the taste of my root! 

294
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,377
What the fuck?

295
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,612
Get the fuck off me!

296
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,560
Oh my God.

297
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,461
Help me.

298
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,054
I could use a drink right now.

300
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,658
Do you mind?

301
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,163
I really appreciate   
your helping me out today.

302
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,699
If it wasn't for
you, who knows, 

303
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,168
I'd probably be dead
in ditch somewhere. 

304
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,839
I see you have an empty
picture frame here.  

305
00:22:53,873 --> 00:23:01,544
Why don't you put
a picture of your family?

306
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,818
I don't really have
anything worth remembering.

308
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,390
Right.

309
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,537
You seem like a smart,
intelligent girl.  

310
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,275
You should be teaching.

311
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:33,779
Tell people about beautiful
things and miracles.    

312
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,382
You're obviously
not from here.  

313
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,851
I'm not from anywhere.

314
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,987
Yeah, well
I fuck for a living

315
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:46,659
and believe me I don't   
have a lot of other options.

316
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,560
Right.

317
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,229
Well, I wouldn't   
know about that shit.

318
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,697
Hey, take it easy.

319
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,466
I think I'm okay now.

320
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,238
I just tell my brain

321
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,774
when I know I'm hurting.

322
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,244
I just say I got
nothing for you buddy.

323
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:10,082
Nothing to make it go  
away, so just go to hell.

324
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,985
And he goes.

325
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,754
He's like a   
brother to me now

326
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:20,526
and brothers fight sometimes.

327
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:28,067
Well, I think it's time to put
you and your brother to bed. 

328
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,275
No, I'm not going
to stay here.  

329
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,609
I'm gonna go, 
it's all right.

330
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,078
No, no, 
it's okay.

331
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,146
I want you to.

332
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,682
It's a good one.

333
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,859
I don't even remember 
when I slept a real bed.

334
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,395
I am tired.

335
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,564
I didn't get your name.

336
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,900
It's Abby.

337
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,635
Here.

338
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,071
Put this on so you don't
get blood on my sheets.

339
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,407
Oh. Thank you.

340
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:17,483
Oh, I like that.

341
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,687
This is good.

343
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,322
Thank you.

344
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,092
Well Abby, can I... 

345
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,863
tell you something
about bears?   

346
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,265
Sure.

347
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,672
The bear is a solitary animal.

348
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,876
They like their space.

349
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,780
They live in a magic circle.

350
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,716
They mind if you're
like a mile away, 

351
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,919
but if you get   
inside their circle,

352
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,722
they will maul you.

353
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,992
If a bear's claw would
ever strike your face,

354
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:04,229
it would take your whole 
face right off your skull.

355
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,365
Your eyes, your 
nose, your lips.

356
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,333
Everything.

357
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,769
And you would die from it.

358
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,738
Wow.

359
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,840
I didn't know bears
could be so vicious.

360
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,444
They are   
wild animals.

361
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:26,185
There's something else about
bears not many people know.

362
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:30,389
If a bear gets hooked on
the taste of human blood,

363
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,860
he becomes a man killer.

364
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,830
He'll go on a rampage

365
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,432
and has to be destroyed

366
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:50,976
and that's why you   
should never hug a bear.

368
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,547
Give me that fucking money!

370
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,948
You fucking little bitch,

371
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:30,983
I'll shove that
money up your...

372
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,919
Move bitch!

373
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,958
Make you feel it.

374
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,928
Help!

376
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,431
Don't let him take me!

377
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,100
Help me someone!

378
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,916
Beautiful.
Beautiful.

379
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,417
I love your work.

380
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,490
Hey!

383
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:16,828
Back for that 10   
dollars, eh dirt bag?

384
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:23,502
You're right.

385
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,670
Ah!      

386
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,173
Yeah! 

387
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,042
Beautiful.

388
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,946
I'm only giving you   
twenty for that one, buddy.

389
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:38,450
Now get down 
on your knees,

390
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,820
go on,  
on you go.

391
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:49,595
Now I want you to start
chewin' the glass.  

392
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,430
What?

393
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:55,100
I want you to start
eating that glass.

394
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,902
Go on.

395
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,570
Don't even bother
looking at this,

396
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,939
until you start chewing.

397
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,075
Go on.

398
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,179
That's it.

399
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,081
That's it. 

400
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,224
Oh, now smile 
for the camera.

401
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,529
Holy shit,     
this is fucking gold!

403
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,368
Now...

405
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,504
pick it up with your mouth.

406
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,974
That's it.

407
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,810
Arrr...

408
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,447
Good dog.

410
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,483
You earned your money today.

411
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,652
Yeah.

412
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,880
Yeah, you heard me right,

413
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:52,084
I want four
big fucking dogs...

414
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,952
Uh-huh, yeah,
yeah, yeah. 

415
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,722
And shave em first.

416
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,457
Lady.

417
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,825
I don't trade for babies.

418
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,194
If you're looking for jewelry,
you gotta cough it up.   

419
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:35,861
All right everyone this is 
a Goddamn fucking robbery!

420
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:42,601
Ah!   

422
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,705
Okay, this guy,
this guy,   

424
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,608
he is a great babysitter!

425
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,742
Don't worry about Junior.

426
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,412
I'll look after him.

427
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,782
Give me the fucking money or 
I'll slit her Goddamn throat!

428
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,116
Okay, okay.

429
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,151
What are you waiting for?

430
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,154
Fucking kill her!  
Kill the fucking baby!

431
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,722
Here it is,  
here it comes.

432
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,490
All right.

433
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,696
Old man, you've got five
seconds to give me what I want

434
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,632
or I will end her life.

435
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,901
Put your hands in 
the cash register,

436
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,170
give me more, you
piece of shit! 

437
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,438
That's it,
that's everything.

438
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,173
-1... 
-No.

439
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,340
2...

440
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,875
Faster,
come on!

441
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,177
3!    

442
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,878
No!   

443
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,963
Come on!

445
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,364
4!

446
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,867
Just fucking kill her already!

447
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,770
I'm gonna sleep in  
your bloody carcasses.

448
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,737
Tonight!

449
00:32:58,677 --> 00:32:59,878
Ah!

452
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,146
Jesus Christ!

453
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,158
You vultures

455
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,595
circle this city, tearing
off the flesh      

456
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,464
from everything 
that is innocent.

457
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,902
Please don't shoot me.

459
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,904
I didn't even hurt her.

460
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,139
I want you out of this city,

461
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,575
you and your     
grave-robbing friends.

462
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,245
Spread the word.

463
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,315
Now!   

465
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,024
Pay guns!

466
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,259
Keep the change.

467
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,499
Oh fuck!

468
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,783
Where's the tape?

470
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,552
Leave me alone man.

471
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,121
Take it out.

472
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:20,759
Now you put it in   
your mouth and eat it.

473
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,439
You fucking bitch.

476
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,274
Stop wasting your 
time doing homework.

477
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:39,244
Get up on the block
and make me some money.

478
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,680
Come on baby,

479
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:45,617
show daddy you ain't mad 
at me and give me a kiss.

480
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,352
Listen.

481
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,554
Go home to someone
who loves you.  

482
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,555
Now.

483
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,528
And you-  
you're fucked.

485
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,676
Fuck em.

489
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,278
Read em and fucking weep!

490
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,946
You can have
the fucking bitches.

491
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,518
Happy Valentines Day,
you fucking sluts!  

493
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,896
Kill him!
Fucking kill him!

495
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,264
Kill him!

496
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,454
Hallelujah.

500
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,673
I'm gonna come down
both your chimneys

505
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:18,076
and give you a big present.

506
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,249
Jerk on this you child
molesting shit-licker.

508
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,850
Ah! 

509
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,631
Night watches and other  
anti-crime groups have been

512
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,966
seen springing up all
throughout the city and their

513
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,537
inspiration, a brave, 
yet still unidentified,

514
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,373
homeless man who has  
been delivering justice,

515
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,842
one shell at a time.

516
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,346
A shotgun!

518
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,549
This town is impressed by

519
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,585
a homeless man with
a fucking shotgun. 

520
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,120
Ow!   

521
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,922
Where's the
creativity in that?

522
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,527
So what happened to you?

523
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,463
School bully get 
your lunch money?

524
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,864
I don't want   
to talk about it.

525
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,200
Look Slick,
don't make me mad.

526
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,801
Tell me who did this to you.

527
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,537
I don't know.
Some bum?  

528
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,339
Some bum!

529
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,576
Have you been watching 
the fucking news lately?

530
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,779
Don't worry, dad,     
we carved that fucker up.

531
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,547
You carved him up.

532
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,649
Somebody does this
to your brother 

533
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,218
and you treat him like
a Jack-o'-lantern.  

534
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,720
Put your head on the table.

535
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,356
Head down, now!   

536
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,924
Don't worry son,     
everybody gets knocked out

537
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,359
once in a while.

538
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,894
Really?

539
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,663
Have you ever  
been knocked out?

540
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,532
Fuck no,   
I'm the Drake,

541
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,300
who's going to fuck with me?

542
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,136
But I'm Slick,  
nobody's supposed

543
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,537
to fuck with me either.

544
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,874
Listen, you've got
a lot of potential,

545
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,876
way more than your brother...

546
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,177
head down.

547
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,480
Maybe even more potential
than me, eventually,  

548
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:06,317
but first you've got to
learn to think bigger. 

549
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,986
Bigger?

550
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,055
I'll crucify him to
a homeless shelter.

551
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,057
That's revenge.
Don't look for revenge.

552
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,160
Look for people's fear.

553
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:16,961
Okay, fear.

554
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,396
I'll cut a hole 
through his body,

555
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,165
and I'll make them watch as
I spread his intestines

556
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,533
out all over the street.

557
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:25,770
Well, you be ugly, you be
hateful when you do that,

558
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,906
some will fear you...

559
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,307
Slick...

560
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,842
I want to fear you...

561
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,243
But I don't...

562
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,712
You've got to show me that
you can scare the shit  

563
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,381
out of everybody!

564
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,651
So why don't you unlock that 
imagination of yours and give

565
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,921
them a show that is so fierce

566
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,889
that everybody in this town

567
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:48,660
will remember  
your name forever.

568
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,196
What should I do?

569
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:56,234
Well, you need to figure
that out for yourself, 

570
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:01,606
but I can give you one 
sweet morsel of advice.

571
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,376
When life gives 
you razor blades,

572
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,316
you make a baseball bat 
covered in razor blades.

573
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,461
Do you kids like school?

578
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,697 
Hey, I asked you a question.

579
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,533
Do you kids like school?

580
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,768
Yeah!

581
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,404
What about ice cream?  
Do you kids like ice cream?

582
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,839
Yeah!

583
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,707
And bicycles!

584
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,042
Yeah!

585
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,777
And hobos?

586
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,279
Yeah!

587
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:18,182
I hate hobos.

588
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:31,963
Disco Inferno

590
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,234
After a horrific act of
arson this afternoon,   

592
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,803
a school bus was
found burning. 

593
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,839
There were an undisclosed  
number of children on board.

594
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,708
There were no survivors.

595
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,745
Again, we regret to inform you
that only the charred bodies 

596
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,349
of many, many, burnt
children remain... 

597
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,456
Hi all you kids out there.

599
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,958
How are you doing today?
Good?         

600
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,826
Great.   
Guess what.

601
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,761
I've got something very,

602
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,364
very special to   
share with you today.

603
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,865
-Are you ready?       
-Yeah, yeah. Come on up to

604
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:09,600
the screen, kids. Let go of your
mommy and daddy's hands.

605
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,735
Come, come on,
it's okay.  

606
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,838
Get as close to 
the TV as you can.

607
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,140
Do you see this!

608
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,509
This is what you get when  
you want to follow a beggar

609
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,011
instead of the DRAKE!

610
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:23,014
Now it's time to
play a new game.

611
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,716
It's called gutter tag.

612
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,185
It's very,
very easy.

614
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,121
And every single one
of you gets to play.

615
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,057
All you homeless people-
you're it.       

616
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,760
Everyone else-   
you get to kill them.

617
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,962
All of them.
Otherwise...

618
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,998
we're going to kill the
rest of your children! 

619
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,667
Ladies and gentlemen,  
one more thing before you

620
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,536
continue on your busy day...

621
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,407
I want that hobo's
head on my wall, 

622
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,975
and whoever brings
him to me,

623
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,946
gets all my broads!

624
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,483
Oh, you're gonna like em!

626
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,168
Grab your guns, boys!

627
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,803
Grab your fucking guns.

628
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,004
We got homeless to kill.

629
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,906
So let's go make 
some dead bodies.

630
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,342
At least he's only   
shooting the dirty cops.

631
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,844
We're all dirty cops.

632
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:01,339
You ever sleep with
a prostitute, kid?

638
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,207
No sir.

639
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,978
Fuck.    
She's so hot,

640
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,413
I'd eat the       
peanuts out of her shit.

641
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,952
Come on. What the fuck
is wrong with you?  

643
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,787
This conversation
is disgusting.  

644
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,124
Well, you can't
beat your wife 

645
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,693
like you can beat a whore.

646
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:26,664
That's what   
I love about them.

647
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,600
Tell you what, we'll
go splits on this one.

648
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:33,104
You're joking right?

649
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,252
Hey, hey, Abby.  

651
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:52,957
Fuck, I love the   
smell of your asshole.

652
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,661
Why don't you get in here
and take me for a ride. 

653
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,263
My legs are closed
for the night.  

654
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,932
Maybe we should 
get back to work.

655
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,634
You get back to the
fucking station.  

656
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:06,571
Get the fuck out of here!

657
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:11,842
Come here, baby!  

658
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,258
No!   

659
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,593
Babydoll.

660
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:31,562
I am going to break your legs
off to get at your sweetness.

661
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,400
Don't hurt me.  
I'll do anything!

663
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:39,470
That's not even 
a fucking option.

664
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,738
Now, I'll tell you what:

665
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,208
you make sure that   
I enjoy what you give me

666
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:49,046
and I'll make sure that 
you can still crawl home

667
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,114
when I'm done.

668
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,418
Oh come on, now I
know you want it,

670
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:55,987
No!

671
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,889
You little fucking whore.

672
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:06,030
Step away from the girl.

673
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,431
I'm a cop!

674
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:08,633
Don't do anything
fucking stupid! 

675
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,568
Shut up!

676
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,536
Look at her.

677
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,273
What do you see?

678
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,441
I don't know man.

679
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,844
She's... she's  
just a fuck tube.

680
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,149
She is a teacher!

681
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,689
She despises you,

683
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,660
and so do I!

685
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,663
STOP!
STOP!

687
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,500
STOP!   

689
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,602
What are you doing?

690
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,205
Let me walk you home!

691
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,574
Why are you out so late-
it's dangerous!     

692
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:53,377
Why are you doing this?

693
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,212
Shit.

694
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,254
What are you doing?
You can't kill them.

696
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,156
I'm cleaning the streets

697
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,959
from the shit and   
the smell makes me sick.

698
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,529
They're not bad people.
They're just scared.  

699
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,631
You're not afraid of

700
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,200
what they'll do to us
when they come here? 

701
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,903
We have to figure
something out.  

702
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:38,723
He shot him!   
The hobo shot him!

705
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:43,361
He's back there!

706
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:07,184
Mom, I need my allowance
early this week...    

708
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,821
I just do!

709
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:11,889
Okay, come on.

710
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,291
Come on.

711
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,302
You're pretty sick, you know that?   

712
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:28,372
Come on, we gotta go.

713
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,717
I gotta go, Mom.

714
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,523
Where the hell were you 
going after you left here?

715
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,858
What?

716
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,096
Come on, man, I let 
you sleep in my bed,

717
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:56,333
tell me where you went.

718
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:59,570
I just wanted to 
buy a lawn mower.

719
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:04,375
Wait- you wanted 
to buy a lawn mower?

720
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,976
Yep.

721
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,812
After all those years living
in box cars and on the  

722
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:12,516
streets, I thought I might
start up my own business.

723
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,419
That's what we'll do.

724
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,221
I've got my own slogan.

725
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,557
You grow it,
I cut it. 

726
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,525
You grow it,
we cut it.  

727
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,227
We'll get out of this
town and go somewhere

728
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,396
where they have   
nice big lawns to mow.

729
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,565
This isn't the only  
place that grass grows.

730
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:28,732
Are you serious?

731
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,801
Yeah.

732
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:34,271
First I gotta wash this 
guys asshole off my face.

733
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:45,683
Slick!
Slick!

734
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,184
Slick!      
They're in there!

735
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,519
Do you need any back-up?
I could join your gang. 

736
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,554
Shut up, Otis.   
Now fucking beat it!

737
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,256
You're pissing me off.

738
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,231
Jesus Christ.

740
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,966
Ivan, you're going to  
ruin your fucking skates.

741
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,667
I ruin everything!

742
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,171
Let's fuck.

744
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,179
Macaroni, beans,
I don't know. 

745
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,981
What would you take?

746
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,149
Why are you in such a rush?

747
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,252
You shot a fucking cop.

748
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:23,754
Everybody wants to kill you.

749
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,990
Oh, all right.

750
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,460
We need a blanket, it's gonna
get cold at night and uh,  

751
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,095
some matches.

752
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,997
I don't have much money.

753
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,134
All right.

754
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:42,273
Don't worry about the money.
We'll hop on a train.   

755
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,976
We'll get a job somewhere
and start saving up.  

756
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,779
No, no,  
no, no TV.

757
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,247
We've gotta travel light.

758
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,149
Right. 
Fuck TV.

759
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,656
Just take what you need.

761
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,329
Okay, I think I'm ready.

762
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,967
Okay, I'm ready too.

763
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,277
Woo!

765
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,781
It's a beautiful day
for a skate rape! 

766
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,549
Is there another way out?

767
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,455
Woo! 

768
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,592
Oh!

769
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,529
Do you fucking see me?

770
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,832
Do you fucking hear me?

771
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:47,638
Do you fucking feel me?

773
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:53,344
Why don't you get up, beggar,

774
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:55,579
and beg me for  
your fucking life?

775
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,281
Ah!

776
00:51:57,314 --> 00:52:01,251
Do you fucking fear me?

777
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:04,288
Fuck you!

778
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,025
My face!

779
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,764
Don't kill that
fuck without me.

781
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,266
Turn that whore  
into a baby factory.

782
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,069
Ah!

784
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,213
Hit me again motherfucker!

785
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,082
Come on.         
Right in my fucking face!

786
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,855
I'm going to wash this  
blood off with your blood!

787
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,923
Get away from me!

788
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:41,792
No!   

789
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,897
Don't kill me,
don't...   

791
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,432
I love murder.

792
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:51,402
Come on,       
play with me grandpa.

794
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:54,071
Fucking play with me Grandpa.

795
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,811
Yeah!

797
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,246
Now we're gettin' rowdy!

798
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,600
Abigail...

802
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,441
Sh-sh-sh...

804
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,748
You!

806
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:42,252
Do you know me?

807
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:49,760
He made me come!

809
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,228
Oh God!

810
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,264
Slick, what the fuck 
is going on in there?

811
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:57,468
You better be killing
that fucking hobo!  

812
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,504
Get the fuck out
of here, Ivan. 

813
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,772
Now!

81
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,440
Bro?

815
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,779
All right, you  
scum carving fuck.

816
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,249
I'm going to make you regret
a whole lot of living   

817
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,251
and teach you some respect.

818
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,552
All right, man,  
you win, you win.

819
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,988
Just tell me what you want? 
My dad owns this fucking town.

820
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,624
I bet there's not one human
being in this town    

821
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,559
whose life you 
haven't ruined.

822
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,695
Pl.. Please don't shoot
my dick off, okay?   

823
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,663
I'm young, I've got too 
much fucking left to do.

824
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:27,731
Please!

825
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,099
Goddamn it boy!

826
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:32,102
Nooooooo!

827
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:38,375
I'm gonna get 
you to a doctor!

829
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:47,684
Just give me the
fucking phone. 

831
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:48,652
What?

832
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,554
Dad...

833
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,756
My whole body hurts

834
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,957
everywhere.

835
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,726
Slick?
Where are you?

836
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:56,727
What happened?

837
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,164
He shot my dick off!

838
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:02,366
Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.

839
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,002
I'm not gonna make it, dad.

840
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,271
I'm dying.
I'm dying.

841
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,875
Slick boy, you're tough
and I'm so proud of you.

842
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,011
You're the toughest
kid I know.

843
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,780
Thank you.

844
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,355
Hey, Dad...

845
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,695
you were a pretty rad father.

846
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,097
Slick...

847
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:36,200
Slick...

848
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,535
Slick!

849
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:56,453
Fix this girl.

851
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,191
Now!

852
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,532
Stop, you can't do that!

854
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,567
Just fix her!

855
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,402
Shit!

856
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,048
Summon the plague.

858
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:29,386
Tell them to bring
me that hobo.  

859
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:56,613
Stay with us honey.

860
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:57,881
Come on,   
stay with us.

861
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,783
It's gonna be okay.  
It's gonna be alright.

862
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,164
She's fucking dying!

864
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,300
Come on!   
Stay with me!

865
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,968
Live!

866
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,404
Live you fuckin' whore!

867
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:37,754
That's it.
Come on. 

871
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,790
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

872
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,466
Hey you.

876
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,635
Welcome back.

877
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,804
It's good to see you.

878
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,642
I wanted to give
you something. 

879
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,985
They're beautiful.

880
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,555
Just to make sure 
you don't forget me.

881
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:51,028
Where are you going?

882
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:55,132
I have to get back to work.

883
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,435
Please don't.

884
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,406
You should put them
in your classroom. 

885
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:06,943
They'll be good by the window.

886
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:15,218
You know I'm not really
a schoolteacher, right?

888
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:20,557
You do right?

890
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:29,099
Yeah, but everybody 
ought to have a dream.

891
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,607
You can't solve all the
world's problems

892
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:42,312
with a shotgun.

893
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,581
It's all I know.

894
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:57,754
A long time ago 
I was one of you.

899
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:05,428
You're all brand
new and perfect.

900
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:08,732
No mistakes,
no regrets.

901
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,570
People look at you
and think of how 

902
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,239
wonderful your
future will be.

903
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:19,209
They want you to be
something special. 

904
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:24,347
Like a doctor or a lawyer.

905
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:28,552
I hate to tell you this,

906
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:31,721
but if you grow up here
you're more likely   

907
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,725
to wind up selling your
bodies on the streets 

908
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:42,699
or shooting dope from dirty
needles in a bus stop.  

909
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,367
And if you're successful,

910
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:48,939
you'll make money selling
junk to crackheads.   

911
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:53,610
And you won't think twice 
about killing someone's wife

912
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:56,413
because you won't even know

913
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,115
what was wrong   
in the first place.

914
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:10,493
Or, maybe you'll
end up like me-

916
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:16,366
a hobo with a shotgun.

918
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,902
I hope you can do better.

919
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:25,542
You are the future.

920
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:38,355
That's it!

922
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:44,594
I am sick and tired of
 you fucking junkies! 

923
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,704
What's going on?

930
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,576
Abby!

934
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,695
Abby.

935
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,164
Abby, come on.

936
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:05,935
Ah!
Oh!

937
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,432
Psst.

941
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,802
You got a match?

943
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,066
Ah, the Plague.

944
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,536
You guys fucking rock!

945
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:22,171
Do you want to see him?

946
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:25,141
No, I trust you guys.

947
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,744
I can fuckin' smell
him from here.   

948
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,846
Take him to the truck.

949
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:34,984
You know, I almost
feel sad for you.

950
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:37,420
You're in the shadow
of your brother.  

951
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:44,027
And you're just a
little tiny thug.

952
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,531
A thug!

953
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,167
Listen you homeless
piece of shit.   

954
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,370
I'm the only son
Drake has left!

955
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,972
And you know what that means?

956
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,908
That means I run 
the fucking show!

957
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:00,743
I'm gonna show everybody.

958
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:03,446
They're gonna fear 
the fuck out of me!

959
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,949
In fact, they're gonna
make comic books   

960
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:09,018
out of my hate crimes!

961
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:12,121
I promise you when
I get out of here,

962
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:15,291
I'm gonna bite your face off.

963
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:19,262
That's funny,

964
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,930
because I promised myself

965
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:23,533
I'm gonna bash   
your fucking teeth in

966
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:26,369
and make a chainsaw
out of them.

967
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,738
Fucker.

969
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,972
Hold it right there, lady.

972
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,341
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

973
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,544
You want to know if I'm  
homeless so you can kill me?

974
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,314
Yeah, are ya?

975
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,619
Some people got a
bed to sleep on,

976
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:50,987
where they can crawl
under the covers  

977
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,889
and have a good night's rest.

978
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,092
But other people,     
they don't got beds at all.

979
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,294
Instead they gotta
find an alleyway,

980
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,465
or a park bench where some 
fucker's not gonna stab them.

981
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,966
But just because 
they don't got beds

982
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,802
doesn't mean  
they're homeless.

983
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:09,939
Cause guess what, they've got
the biggest home of any of us.

984
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,709
It's called the streets!

985
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:16,546
And right now, we're all
standing in their home, 

986
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:21,684
so maybe we should show  
them some Goddamn respect.

987
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,286
If this is their home,

988
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,922
they've got a right to  
keep it clean, don't they?

989
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,624
And sometimes on the streets,

990
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:31,427
a broom just ain't  
gonna fucking cut it.

991
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,330
That's when you  
gotta get a shotgun!

992
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:37,767
So if you want to
kill me, go ahead.

993
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,469
But I'll warn you.

994
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:40,803
From where I'm standing,

995
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:44,874
things are looking 
real fucking filthy!

996
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:04,093
Ladies and gentlemen,

997
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,730
welcome back to
the Drake show!

998
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,838
Yeah!

1000
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:18,040
That's how you cheer, 
you fucking creatures.

1001
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:19,642
Woo!

1002
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,677
Thank you.
Thank you.

1003
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,946
Thank you everybody.

1004
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:27,183
Tonight I have a special
treat for you all.   

1005
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:30,353
The culmination of one of
the bloodiest spectacles 

1006
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,088
we have ever witnessed.

1007
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,091
Everybody please,  
a round of applause

1008
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,960
to the team that  
made this possible.

1009
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:39,562
The Plague.

1010
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:52,241
Now, I want you all to
meet our special guest.

1012
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:54,944
A man I'm sure you've
all heard about.  

1013
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,547
Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado, 

1014
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,616
let's bring on the
man of the hour. 

1015
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:06,622
The one responsible for the
death of my favorite son. 

1016
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:08,391
And here he is,

1017
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,593
a worthless,

1018
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:14,063
homeless piece of shit...

1019
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,699
Get your hands off me,
you demons!     

1020
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,768
You're crushing my smokes.

1021
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,736
When God lost his son,

1022
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,105
he knew he'd get him
back in a few days.

1023
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,341
He never had to mourn, 
not for a single second.

1024
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,311
But, I know I   
can't get my son back.

1025
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,346
So, what does that make me,

1026
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,316
when I know more about pain

1027
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:37,687
than the most powerful
being in the universe?

1028
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,389
You're a fool.

1029
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:43,359
And a shitty father.

1030
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:49,232
Take him to the glory hole.

1031
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,908
Look up at all those people.

1032
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,843
I'm your God.

1033
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:04,480
They fear me more
than anything. 

1034
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:09,485
And that fear is what saves
their lives everyday.   

1035
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,921
If I want something
from them, I take it.

1036
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,956
If they try to fight
back, I kill them.  

1037
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,124
Fucker.

1038
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,193
They live to please me.

1039
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,995
Because if they don't,

1040
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:21,264
I cut off their
fucking heads! 

1041
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:32,975
Well, now you look scared.

1043
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:35,411
Drake.

1044
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,447
Eventually, evil...  

1045
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:42,084
will turn against evil.

1046
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,420
It'll wipe itself out,

1047
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:50,226
leaving nothing but wreckage.

1049
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,162
And fucked up memories.

1050
01:13:56,032 --> 01:14:00,036
Every time I find
somebody like you,

1051
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,171
who wants to be a hero,

1052
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:05,508
who wants to fuck
with me and stop my show,

1053
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:10,413
I send em
straight to hell.

1054
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,187
What the...

1056
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:23,759
Let him go, Drake, or I'll
chop your boy to pieces.

1057
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,594
Abby.

1058
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,163
I mean it.

1059
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:30,633
I'll mulch this fucker
into the ground.   

1060
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,069
What do you think?

1061
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,671
Replaceable.

1062
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:39,108
Dad, I'm the only
son you have left.

1063
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,310
Quit fuckin' around.

1064
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,245
Sorry boy, but...  

1065
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,916
you've just never had
that much potential. 

1066
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:54,790
No one upstages the Drake!

1068
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,129
Do you see what I mean folks?

1070
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:03,532
I provide you with nothing
 but the highest quality, 

1071
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:08,537
adrenaline filled  
family entertainment.

1072
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:32,228
Okay, Rip, let's get
us some hobo head! 

1075
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,072
Oh!

1077
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:47,977
Let's go home.

1080
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,478
Get this off me... 

1081
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:52,014
You want to be the
star of this show?

1082
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,016
I'll make you shine.

1083
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,053
You take your dirty hands
  off her, you bastard.  

1084
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,321
I'd love to just shoot
 her but my audience, 

1085
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:02,758
they expect more. 

1086
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:04,093
Get your hands off me!

1087
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:05,294
Settle down, honey.    

1088
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:10,399
This will be the best
trick you ever gave. 

1089
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,836
Let's start with
a nose job, huh?

1091
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,838
No!

1092
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,774
Get me out of this hole!

1097
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,909
How?

1098
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,145
Pull my hair!

1099
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,646
My hair.

1100
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,416
Pull it!
Pull it!

1101
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,320
Harder!
Harder!

1103
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:15,397
Untie me.

1105
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,675
Demon's coming back.

1107
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,691
She killed Grinder.

1109
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:46,028
Now she must take his
place in the Plague. 

1110
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:53,235
She's not going
anywhere buddy.

1111
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:13,923
Listen to me.

1112
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:16,525
You can't fall asleep now.

1113
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,294
You hear me?

1114
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,841
There's one more  
thing I have to do.

1116
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,712
No, I just wanna
go to the zoo 

1117
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:42,384
and see the bears with you.

1118
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,726
Don't leave me.
Don't leave.  

1119
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:54,163
Bears don't belong
in a zoo.    

1120
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,409
Stupid fucking bitch.

1121
01:19:07,443 --> 01:19:10,145
I'm gonna find her

1122
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:16,151
and I'm gonna   
fucking kill her...

1124
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,687
and I'm gonna cut his
fucking nuts off  

1125
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,290
and stick it up 
his fucking ass.

1126
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,198
Show's over.

1127
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:33,602
You know, except  
for killing my son,

1128
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:37,640
you made my town a  
lot more interesting.

1129
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:40,109
You're so fucking crazy.

1130
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,777
I would have been 
your biggest fan,

1131
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,879
you worthless street rat.

1132
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:57,593
Drop the fucking gun, you
cocksucking garbage bag.

1134
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:09,772
Put it down and walk away.

1135
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,441
This is your only  
chance to leave alive!

1136
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:16,178
You want to die for a town

1137
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:18,714
that never gave 
a fuck about you?

1138
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,456
You'll never beat the Drake.

1139
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,892
This town worships me.

1140
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,528
Boys, if he shoots,
kill the fucker.  

1141
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,565
Whoa, what the   
fuck are you doing?

1143
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,901
Get back inside everybody.

1144
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:44,073
Put your weapons down!

1146
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:47,776
I said put the Goddamn weapons down!

1147
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,449
Okay, get rid of these
fucking animals now. 

1149
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:58,887
You fuckers!

1150
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:04,893
You and me are going 
on a car ride to hell.

1151
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:10,432
You're gonna miss me.

1152
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:13,001
You're riding shotgun.

1153
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,069
Nooooo!
