1
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:31,332
His name is Leopold Kessler.

2
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,398
My God! Isn't he aware of
the situation in Germany?

3
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,319
No! I don't want any gratitude.

4
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,872
If your nephew is ready,
we'll begin the checkup.

5
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:40,526
Thank you, Herr Kessler. There's
no need for further examination.

6
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,960
Your nephew is of sound health.

7
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,170
Standard fee, please.

8
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,010
Humility, Kessler.
Never forget humility.

9
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,428
Close it!

10
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,376
There's nothing to see!

11
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,858
- Good evening, Herr Kessler.
- Evening, Fraulein Schulze.

12
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,696
- Tonight you'll be on train 317.
- Frankfurt -- Berlin.

13
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:00,033
- Tomorrow, train 212.
- Berlin -- Munich.

14
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,130
Then on train 522.

15
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,141
Timetable, list of sales, receipts,
electrical chart, green checkbook,

16
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,881
book of tickets, account book
and the green journal.

17
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,016
Thank you, Fraulein Schulze.

18
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,119
The inspector wants you
to go to turntable three.

19
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,749
Really?

20
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,158
I've promised not to say any more,

21
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,690
but I think he has
a surprise for you.

22
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,295
Wait.

23
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,501
I see the young Herr Kessler
has not yet paid his guarantee.

24
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,670
I thought I 'd tell you right away.

25
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,641
Car 2306 is back in working order.
- Is it, lnspector?

26
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,218
It is indeed, Kessler.

27
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,847
Your nephew is off to a great start.
You may turn the handle, please.

28
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,288
Yes, lnspector.

29
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,453
Track 8, Kessler.

30
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,232
You will have the honor of serving
on the first first-class sleeper

31
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,699
to run under the revived
Zentropa company.

32
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:41,229
We have worked night and day to
get this train back on the track.

33
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:46,642
I understand you specifically wish to
become a sleeping-car conductor.

34
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,441
A fine choice.

35
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,083
But there was also
a symbolic element

36
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,381
in the management's decision
of giving the job to a foreigner.

37
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:59,752
We are dealing with the important
matter of human transportation,

38
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,327
which no borders should impede.

39
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,423
I also started out
as a sleeping-car conductor.

40
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,126
Those were my happiest days.

41
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,794
An engine driver's work is exciting.

42
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,363
The same goes for
the systematics in the tower.

43
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:21,138
But only the conductor comes into
direct contact with the passengers.

44
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,777
He can say "I can promise you
a most pleasant journey.

45
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,876
May you all enjoy a peaceful sleep."

46
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,353
Right, Kessler?
- Certainly, lnspector.

47
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,887
I call this a mythological task.

48
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,588
You will accompany your uncle
while you are training.

49
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:42,957
After your exam in three months' time,
you can move on.

50
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,830
But you can read all about that
in the service rule book.

51
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,700
Here it comes.

52
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,968
First-class tickets only!

53
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,165
First-class tickets!

54
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,967
Money... please...

55
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,903
Give us some money.

56
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,881
It's the rule!

57
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,069
You can make the bed.

58
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,643
Please forgive me. It's my first trip.

59
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,229
Herr Kessler, you are a true idealist.

60
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:06,317
Let me tell you,
it is most frightening.

61
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:23,631
Young Kessler, you're a blockhead!

62
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,758
Wake up! Leo, you have to hurry.

63
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,963
My nephew, Leopold Kessler,
has been invited to dine at 7 :00.

64
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,176
He is entirely to blame
for any delay.

65
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,078
I leave him in your hands.
I will wait for him in the kitchen.

66
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,614
They've already sat down to eat.

67
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,758
"... at the right hour you feed them.

68
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:32,231
You open your hand and bless
all who dwell there. Amen."

69
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,000
Our guest has arrived.

70
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,433
So sorry I'm late.

71
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,278
Never excuse yourself, young man.

72
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,807
Life is too short.

73
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:48,284
Kat tells me you have recently
joined our company.

74
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,448
I'm very pleased.

75
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,756
Father is pleased you're American.

76
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,657
He'd like Zentropa
to be international.

77
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,457
Germans are ill-regarded right now.

78
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,930
Rubbish, Larry. Let's eat.

79
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,698
My sister's got her eye on you.

80
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,432
Calm down, both of you.

81
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:15,312
It's very brave of you to come
to Germany at such a time.

82
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,112
A great tragedy has befallen
this part of the world.

83
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,990
What kind of question is that
to ask our guest?

84
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,153
I'm afraid I'm not very religious.

85
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,124
Herr Kessler is a sensible man.

86
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:38,530
He realizes that if the scars
of this war are to heal,

87
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,528
then we must turn to one another.

88
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,807
My sister says you're a deserter.

89
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,208
In my father's opinion, so am l.

90
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,745
That's enough, Larry.

91
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,817
My son was too ill to join up.

92
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,615
Ill! The illness my father
has never understood.

93
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:01,556
He thinks it stems from my mother
spoiling me till the day she died.

94
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,091
Excuse me.

95
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,090
I apologize for my son's behavior.

96
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,430
- I thought you didn't like excuses.
- Damn it!

97
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,504
Excuse me, Father.

98
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,571
In war, life is so simple.

99
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,941
It's only afterwards
that complications arise.

100
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,009
Don't you agree, Father?
- Certainly.

101
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,119
Religion is important in wartime,

102
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,452
but even more so when the silence
of arms toys with our peace of mind.

103
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,193
When we pray to God
in time of war,

104
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,865
we can only rely on his support
if we have faith in our cause.

105
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,535
Excuse me, Father,

106
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,538
but what about the other side?

107
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,803
Why, of course, Herr Kessler.
God is on everyone's side.

108
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,906
But when you fight for a cause
with all your heart,

109
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,154
then God finds it easier to forgive

110
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:06,280
if, in doing so,
you disobey his commands.

111
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,283
Who does God not forgive?

112
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,158
Those who do not believe.

113
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,593
Those who remain lukewarm,
who don't take sides.

114
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,894
They are condemned
to eternal wandering.

115
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,071
He shows them no mercy,
Herr Kessler.

116
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,367
"So, because thou art lukewarm,
and neither cold nor hot,

117
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,071
I will spew thee out of my mouth."

118
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,314
They're about to blast them.

119
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,018
The Allies are blowing up cranes in
Westhafen. They're dismantling.

120
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,724
Dismantling?

121
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,494
To prevent another German
military power from rising up.

122
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:56,601
They're destroying everything
that could be used for military ends.

123
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:02,307
I fail to see how the few cranes
we have left might pose a threat.

124
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,309
The food supply situation
will become even worse.

125
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:10,184
You're so naive, Kat. The cranes
are loading coal for lG Farben.

126
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:14,882
The Americans are clever.
They get hold of the chemical patents

127
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,390
and then they destroy the plants
to prevent production.

128
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,862
All in the name of demilitarization.

129
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,716
So that's that.
You can serve the coffee now.

130
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,887
You must understand, Leopold,

131
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:58,033
our family has always treasured
international contacts.

132
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,530
Pay us a visit from time to time.

133
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,033
How about dinner on Friday?

134
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,781
I'm sure you'll like Alex.

135
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:23,286
We studied together in Berlin
and now he's back in Germany.

136
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,890
Colonel Harris.

137
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,799
Thank you for a pleasant evening.

138
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:13,435
I must go and check on the church
before curfew.

139
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:20,914
I'm afraid we won't have time for
chess tonight, Colonel Harris.

140
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,498
Come and sit down.

141
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,974
Your uncle wants to leave now.
He's waiting in the hall.

142
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,741
Good-bye, Fraulein Hartmann.

143
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,855
Herr Kessler.

144
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,796
I'm a friend of the Hartmann family.

145
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,805
They said I could ask a small favor.

146
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,345
My nephews are going to Cologne.

147
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,548
Would you please look after them?

148
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,250
They'll be picked up at the station.

149
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,812
The tickets and papers are in order.

150
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,114
You can stay in here.

151
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,804
Sekt for Ravenstein.

152
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:13,972
The Allied command in Frankfurt
has appointed my husband mayor.

153
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,212
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

154
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,209
Excuse me.

155
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,216
Are you the engine driver?
- I'm the sleeping-car conductor.

156
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,252
I don't wish to impose,

157
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:35,192
but my family and myself lived
in London during the war

158
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,200
and now we're returning
to Wollstadt.

159
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,999
But my wife is suddenly refusing
to get off the train.

160
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:47,301
She's very upset about the state
Germany is in right now.

161
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,778
Would you be so kind as to
help me set her mind at rest?

162
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:55,478
If you could perhaps reassure her

163
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:59,847
that Wollstadt has been
spared the havoc of war.

164
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,591
We live at 43 Sachsenstrasse.

165
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:08,529
I don't know Wollstadt, but what
I've seen from the train looks bad.

166
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,301
But you must help me.

167
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,607
I'll never get her off the train.

168
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:22,436
Wollstadt is our home.
We can get a taxi from the station.

169
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,338
My dear, I have encouraging news.

170
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,212
Please repeat what you told me.

171
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,779
I don't really know Wollstadt.

172
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:37,323
But you did tell me Wollstadt
had been spared.

173
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,953
I only know what I saw
from the train.

174
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,395
Did you hear?

175
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,501
Next station is Wollstadt.
You'd better get ready.

176
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,204
Palestine!

177
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,975
She wants us to live in the desert.

178
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,739
We are Jewish, but we are German,
but we are Jewish.

179
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,841
Savages!

180
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:18,892
It's outrageous!

181
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:37,276
We have problems with the heating,
but we can offer you blankets.

182
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,123
We have problems with the heating,
but we can offer you blankets.

183
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:55,028
Give the children some chocolate.

184
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,616
- We'd like another bottle of Sekt.
- Of course, right away.

185
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,353
Go on, have another piece.

186
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,996
Chocolate?

187
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,508
Papers, please.

188
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,377
I insist on a return game today,
Colonel Harris.

189
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,993
I've never understood how anyone
could be proud to be German.

190
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,790
If I had my way, I'd be on a plane
bound for America today.

191
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,860
You find that hard to understand.

192
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,569
I think the war was a waste of time.

193
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:32,004
It's how you would feel if you were
to attend the good Father's Mass.

194
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,876
The ceremony might be colorful,
even entertaining,

195
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,987
but to a disbeliever it's simply
a sophisticated waste of time.

196
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,521
Shoddy too, when the sacrament
is nothing but a dry cracker.

197
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,828
She's flirting with you.

198
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,735
A bit scheming, don't you think?

199
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,197
Why not dance with her?

200
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,434
Not today. I'm a little tired.

201
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,496
It's time, Max. The Jew is here.

202
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,270
Marie.

203
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,463
Bring me those silly papers.

204
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,512
They're the rules.

205
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,089
I must ask, do you know this man?

206
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:42,605
Max Hartmann is my friend.
He gave me food and hid me in his cellar.

207
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,177
No more!

208
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,951
I won't do it again.

209
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,422
Do what you like!

210
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,059
Is it my move?

211
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,493
What am I doing? No.

212
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,201
I think I'll retire now.

213
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,775
No need to disturb
the Father and Alex.

214
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,505
Good night to you both.

215
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,539
Good night, Father.

216
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,015
Your uncle has always
been a good man.

217
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,917
Don't forget that
whatever happens,

218
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,496
you must always do
what you think is right.

219
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:53,292
Never let anyone tell you otherwise.

220
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,805
Katharina.

221
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,885
Put the lamp out.

222
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,648
The lamp.

223
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,824
I am a werewolf.

224
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,137
Yes, I'm afraid I have to admit
you have won.

225
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,724
It's just a game.

226
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,576
It's time to go home, Colonel.

227
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,666
Do you have a moment?
We need your help.

228
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,575
I beg you, Herr Leopold,
come with me.

229
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,335
Be careful.

230
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,545
Welcome, Herr Kessler.

231
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:26,218
I can understand that this setup
might puzzle you somewhat.

232
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,658
But this sector is in
a state of emergency

233
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:35,661
and the authorities won't allow us
to give Max a proper burial.

234
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,065
Gatherings are forbidden,
Herr Kessler.

235
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,237
Therefore we must resort to this...

236
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,771
most unworthy arrangement.

237
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:51,035
We will proceed
with our ceremony in secret,

238
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,080
Iike the Christians
in the catacombs.

239
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:59,282
Everyone is gathering at the old
marshaling yard at Darmstadt.

240
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,883
Your job is to stop the train there

241
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,586
so that we can get the coffin
off the train.

242
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,437
You've pulled the emergency brake!

243
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,550
Herr Leopold!

244
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:55,660
Over here.

245
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,278
Kat is a lovely girl.

246
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:18,152
I just wanted to thank you.

247
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,914
My nephews' journey
went splendidly.

248
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,056
What would they have done
without you?

249
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:33,263
Our superiors appreciate your help
in the Ravenstein assassination.

250
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:38,004
We have a new job in mind for you.

251
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,100
There's your girlfriend.

252
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:00,956
Listen, Leo.

253
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:05,630
I'm not asking you to
decide right now.

254
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:20,478
We will offer Herr Kessler
a ride back to Frankfurt.

255
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,509
Then we must fix the back door.

256
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:26,549
It sticks.

257
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,424
You have a visitor.

258
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,833
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- Not at all.

259
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,405
Have you been promoted yet?

260
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,997
My exam is in a few weeks.

261
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,335
What are you doing in Munich?

262
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:27,444
I'm at St. Christopher's Church.

263
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,375
I've come --

264
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:33,683
I've come to ask you not to
judge Kat too harshly.

265
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:38,353
I know that she told you
about her mistake.

266
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,924
Kat is confused, as so many
others are these days.

267
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:45,523
But she is not a werewolf.

268
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:51,039
She repents her sins and is trying
very hard to make amends.

269
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:56,876
She had to flee from those people
in Frankfurt. They stop at nothing.

270
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:00,575
Max Hartmann received
threatening letters.

271
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:05,551
His collaboration with the
Americans was no secret.

272
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:15,430
And after he died, the authorities
confiscated his entire estate.

273
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,996
Do you have any contact with Kat?

274
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,963
I really must go now.
We will meet again.

275
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,648
Herr Kessler, if I were you,

276
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:39,611
I'd attend the midnight mass
at St. Christopher's tonight.

277
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:46,166
With this ring I thee wed.

278
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,702
In the name of the Holy Trinity.

279
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:58,073
I'm afraid the young Herr Hartmann
wasn 't as cooperative as yourself.

280
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:02,247
But then, what's one faggot less?

281
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,383
We've taken her to
a temporary hiding place.

282
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:10,151
We thought you'd be more
cooperative if she was with us.

283
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:15,056
I'm so glad you came, Leopold.
We can discuss your next job.

284
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:19,431
We would like the Bremen line
to be shut down, tonight.

285
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,768
You're a capable man.

286
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,595
We're sure you can handle
a big job like this.

287
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:30,039
All you have to do is place some
explosives underneath your sleeper.

288
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:33,611
The bomb will be detonated
on the Neuwied Bridge.

289
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,910
You'll have ample time to get out.

290
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:40,547
I'm sorry to press you like this,
because I do like you.

291
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:44,854
Remember, tonight you're
going on the Bremen Express.

292
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:06,433
Allow me to present the examinee:
Leopold Kessler, my nephew.

293
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:10,375
Herr Seifert and lnspector Steleman
are in charge of the examination.

294
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:13,346
There is a practical
and a theoretical part.

295
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:15,778
First, we'll ask some questions.

296
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:18,751
Then we will accompany you

297
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:23,086
to see how you manage with both
the passengers and the equipment.

298
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:28,493
The conductor must be both
polite and firm at all times.

299
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:32,360
Accompany us to compartment nine
and we can begin.

300
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,867
Has this exam taken you by surprise?

301
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:39,870
No, it's just that I was attending to
one of the passengers.

302
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:44,907
If you don't mind, I'll just finish what
I was doing and be back at once.

303
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:41,128
They want you to place a bomb.
Listen to me!

304
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,777
Tell him your life is at stake.

305
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,283
I can't say any more.

306
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,892
They're watching you, remember.

307
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,959
Checkpoint Urmitz!

308
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,596
The assessor
is getting a little impatient.

309
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:48,592
I think we had better proceed
with the examination.

310
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:03,846
So, we would like to know
what you would do

311
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:07,916
if the cleaner handed you
a green card

312
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:10,958
filled in like this.

313
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:37,375
Have you gone completely mad?

314
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,045
Get out of here this instant!

315
01:27:56,671 --> 01:28:00,072
My nephew's behavior
cannot be excused.

316
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:04,634
My first thought was to advise you
to cancel the exam at once.

317
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:24,824
- Do you wish to proceed?
- That is up to the examiner.

318
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,433
I shall repeat my question.

319
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,470
What would you do if the cleaner

320
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:34,029
handed you a green card
filled in like this?

321
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,909
Can't you see
it's filled in incorrectly?

322
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,882
Completely incorrect.

323
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:56,157
Would you like to tell the examinee
the correct answer to the question?

324
01:28:57,865 --> 01:29:00,527
It's a trick question.

325
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:05,033
The answer is:
Report the cleaner immediately!

326
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:11,209
The green card should never be
in the cleaner's possession.

327
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:16,380
The cleaner never keeps
any papers for the conductor.

328
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:20,086
On the contrary, the conductor
must give him a receipt

329
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:22,514
as soon as he takes over.

330
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:25,683
And which form is used for this?

331
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:29,356
Yes, B, that is correct.

332
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:33,692
And now a question after
Herr Seifert's own heart.

333
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:38,033
What is stated in paragraph four,
section 62 of the rule book?

334
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:55,388
I must inform you that an open collar
is against the regulations.

335
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:14,339
Your uncle kindly got a card for you.

336
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:18,472
We now want you to make bed 42.

337
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:22,739
I have put the correct number
of bedding covers out for you.

338
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:25,675
You may begin when I say so.

339
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:29,883
We want you to make the bed twice.

340
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:32,721
Then we will examine the bed.

341
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:35,421
Are you ready with the clock?

342
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,994
You may now begin.

343
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:39,698
The clock is ticking.

344
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,603
The clock is ticking!

345
01:30:59,587 --> 01:31:01,350
No time for that.

346
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,889
The clock is ticking.

347
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:26,477
Hurry, Herr Kessler,
the clock is ticking.

348
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:41,485
The clock is ticking!

349
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,017
Thank you.

350
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:02,815
Herr Kessler.

351
01:37:05,853 --> 01:37:10,051
Would you please come to
compartment nine for a moment?

352
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:39,613
I was told I might find
the conductor here.

353
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,349
I have a problem. Is it too much
to ask for a bit of service?

354
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:46,453
We must be quiet.

355
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:52,558
The assessor needs to rest
before we proceed with the exam.

356
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:57,631
Let me give you a piece of advice.

357
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:04,108
In my opinion,
you have only one chance.

358
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:11,145
When Herr Seifert wakes up, ask him
to follow you through the train

359
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:15,746
as you give each of the passengers
an unconditional apology.

360
01:38:41,949 --> 01:38:42,973
Conductor!

361
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:51,151
These shoes need polishing.

362
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:54,085
I wanted them polished.

363
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,665
I am sure the shoes
have been polished.

364
01:39:05,306 --> 01:39:08,366
I don't think so.
There's no chalk mark.

365
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:16,850
You'd better watch your step!

366
01:39:28,195 --> 01:39:31,562
You pulled the emergency brake!

367
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:29,354
Refreshments?

368
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:33,059
Bed-making?

369
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:36,120
Shoeshine?
