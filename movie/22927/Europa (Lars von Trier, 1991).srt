1
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,549
His name is Leopold Kessler

2
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,869
My God! Isn't he aware of
the situation in Germany?

3
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,716
No! I don't want any gratitude

4
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,159
If your nephew is ready,
we'll begin the check-up

5
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,913
Thank you, Herr Kessler. There's
no need for further examination

6
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,231
Your nephew is of sound health

7
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,357
Standard fee, please

8
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,352
Humility, Kessler,
never forget humility

9
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,795
Close it!

10
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,192
There's nothing to see!

11
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,910
- Good evening, Herr Kessler
- 'Evening, Fraulein Schulze

12
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,159
- Tonight you'll be on train 317
- Frankfurt-Berlin

13
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,672
- Tomorrow, train 212
- Berlin-Munich

14
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,711
Then on train 522

15
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,439
Timetable, list of sales, receipts,
electrical chart, green cheque-book...

16
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,031
...book of tickets, account book
and the green journal

17
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,072
Thank you, Fraulein Schulze

18
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,876
The inspector wants you
to go to turntable 3

19
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,555
Really?

20
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,870
I've promised not to say any more...

21
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,278
...but I think he has
a surprise for you

22
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,635
Wait

23
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,679
I see the young Herr Kessler
has not yet paid his guarantee

24
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,271
I thought I'd tell you right away

25
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,076
- Car 2306 is back in working order
- Is it, inspector?

26
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
It is indeed, Kessler

27
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,031
Your nephew is off to a great start;
you may turn the handle, please

28
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,428
Yes, inspector

29
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,512
Track 8, Kessler

30
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,080
You will have the honour of serving
on the first First Class sleeper...

31
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,389
...to run under the revived
Zentropa company

32
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,754
We have worked night and day to
get this train back on the track

33
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,911
I understand you specifically wish to
become a sleeping-car conductor

34
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,672
A fine choice

35
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,197
But there was also a
symbolic element...

36
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,318
...in the management's decision
of giving the job to a foreigner

37
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,519
We are dealing with the important
matter of human transportation...

38
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,989
...which no borders should impede

39
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,918
I also started out as a
sleeping-car conductor

40
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,514
Those were my happiest days

41
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,993
An engine-driver's work is exciting

42
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,436
The same goes for the
systematics in the tower

43
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,037
But only the conductor comes into
direct contact with the passengers

44
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,640
He can say "I can promise you
a most pleasant journey

45
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,473
"You can all enjoy a peaceful sleep"

46
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,870
- Right, Kessler?
- Certainly, inspector

47
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,234
I call this a mythological task

48
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,796
You will accompany your uncle
while you are training

49
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,950
After your exam in three months'
time, you can move on

50
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,678
But you can read all about that
in the service rule book

51
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,395
Here it comes

52
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,072
First class tickets only!

53
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,150
First class tickets!

54
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,598
Money... please...

55
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,472
Give us some money

56
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,039
It's the rule!

57
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,478
You can make the bed

58
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,995
Please forgive me, it's my first trip

59
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,800
Herr Kessler, you are a true idealist

60
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,029
Let me tell you,
it is most frightening

61
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,750
Young Kessler, you're a blockhead!

62
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,552
Wake up! Leo, you have to hurry

63
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,474
My nephew, Leopold Kessler,
has been invited to dine at seven

64
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,518
He is entirely to blame
for any delay

65
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,275
I leave him in your hands. I will
wait for him in the kitchen

66
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,710
They've already sat down to eat

67
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,234
"...at the right hour You feed them

68
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,519
"You open Your hand and bless
all who dwell there. Amen"

69
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,156
Our guest has arrived

70
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,476
So sorry I'm late

71
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,195
Never excuse yourself, young man

72
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,636
Life is too short

73
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,918
Kat tells me you have recently
joined our company

74
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,992
I'm very pleased

75
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,159
Father is pleased you're American

76
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,959
He'd like Zentropa
to be international

77
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,634
Germans are ill-regarded right now

78
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,995
Rubbish, Larry. Let's eat

79
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,630
My sister's got her eye on you

80
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,196
Calm down, both of you

81
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,830
It's very brave of you to come
to Germany at such a time

82
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,429
A great tragedy has befallen
this part of the world

83
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,991
What kind of question is that
to ask our guest?

84
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,031
I'm afraid I'm not very religious

85
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,874
Herr Kessler is a sensible man

86
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,119
He realises that if the scars
of this war are to heal...

87
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,989
...then we must turn to one another

88
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,115
My sister says you're a deserter

89
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,396
In my father's opinion, so am I

90
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,913
That's enough, Larry

91
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,793
My son was too ill to join up

92
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,437
Ill! The illness my father
has never understood

93
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,196
He thinks it stems from my mother
spoiling me till the day she died

94
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,674
Excuse me

95
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,436
I apologise for my son's behaviour

96
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,672
- I thought you didn't like excuses
- Damn it!

97
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,597
Excuse me, Father

98
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,519
In war, life is so simple

99
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,709
It's only afterwards that
complications arise

100
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,628
- Don't you agree, Father?
- Certainly

101
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,589
Religion is important in wartime...

102
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,799
...but even more so when the silence
of arms toys with our peace of mind

103
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,353
When we pray to God
in time of war...

104
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,838
...we can only rely on His support
if we have faith in our cause

105
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,399
Excuse me, Father...

106
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,229
...but what about the other side?

107
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,239
Why, of course, Herr Kessler.
God is on everyone's side

108
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,156
But when you fight for a cause
with all your heart...

109
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,238
...then God finds it
easier to forgive...

110
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,272
...if, in doing so, you disobey
His commands

111
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,111
Who does God not forgive?

112
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,919
Those who do not believe

113
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,197
Those who remain lukewarm,
who don't take sides

114
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,358
They are condemned to
eternal wandering

115
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,399
He shows them no mercy,
Herr Kessler

116
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,512
"So, because thou art lukewarm,
and neither cold nor hot...

117
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,148
"...I will spew thee out of my mouth"

118
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,235
They're about to blast them

119
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,428
The Allies are blowing up cranes in
Westhafen. They're dismantling...

120
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,035
Dismantling?

121
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,670
To prevent another German
military power from rising up

122
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,513
They're destroying everything that
could be used for military ends

123
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,993
I fail to see how the few cranes
we have left might pose a threat

124
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,832
The food supply situation
will become even worse

125
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,555
You're so naive, Kat. The cranes
are loading coal for IG-Farben

126
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,078
The Americans are clever, they
get hold of the chemical patents...

127
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,397
...and then they destroy the plants
to prevent production

128
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,790
All in the name of demilitarization

129
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,757
So that's that. You can
serve the coffee now

130
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,474
You must understand, Leopold...

131
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,435
Our family has always treasured
international contacts

132
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,830
Pay us a visit from time to time

133
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,230
How about dinner on Friday?

134
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,434
I'm sure you'll like Alex

135
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,676
We studied together in Berlin
and now he's back in Germany

136
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,109
Colonel Harris

137
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,276
Thank you for a pleasant evening

138
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,752
I must go and check on the church
before curfew

139
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,911
I'm afraid we won't have time for
chess tonight, Colonel Harris

140
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,918
Come and sit down

141
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,755
Your uncle wants to leave now.
He's waiting in the hall

142
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,319
Goodbye, Fraulein Hartmann

143
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,075
Herr Kessler

144
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,751
I'm a friend of the Hartmann family

145
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,635
They said I could ask a small favour

146
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,035
My nephews are going to Cologne

147
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,115
Would you please look after them?

148
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,711
They'll be picked up at the station

149
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,118
The tickets and papers are in order

150
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,228
You can stay in here

151
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,079
Sekt for Ravenstein

152
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,994
The Allied command in Frankfurt
has appointed my husband mayor

153
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,075
- Congratulations
- Thank you

154
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,955
Excuse me

155
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,676
- Are you the engine-driver?
- I'm the sleeping-car conductor

156
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,588
I don't wish to impose...

157
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,271
...but my family and myself lived
in London during the war...

158
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,193
...and now we're returning
to Wolstadt

159
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,875
But my wife is suddenly refusing
to get off the train

160
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,716
She's very upset about the state
Germany is in right now

161
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,235
Would you be so kind as to
help me set her mind at rest?

162
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,790
If you could perhaps reassure her...

163
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,993
...that Wolstadt has been
spared the havoc of war

164
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,557
We live at 43 Sachsenstrasse

165
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,312
I don't know Wolstadt, but what
I've seen from the train looks bad

166
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,917
But you must help me

167
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,036
I'll never get her off the train

168
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,719
Wolstadt is our home, we can
get a taxi from the station...

169
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,434
My dear, I have encouraging news

170
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,150
Please repeat what you told me

171
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,591
I don't really know Wolstadt...

172
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,111
But you did tell me Wolstadt
had been spared

173
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,429
I only know what I saw
from the train

174
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,828
Did you hear?

175
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,715
Next station is Wolstadt.
You'd better get ready

176
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,353
Palestine!

177
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,957
She wants us to live in the desert

178
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,589
We are Jewish, but we are German,
but we are Jewish

179
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,595
Savages!

180
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,789
It's outrageous!

181
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,428
We have problems with the heating,
but we can offer you blankets

182
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,708
We have problems with the heating,
but we can offer you blankets

183
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,429
Give the children some chocolate

184
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,438
- We'd like another bottle of sekt
- Of course, right away

185
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,071
Go on, have another piece

186
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,398
Chocolate?

187
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,389
Papers, please

188
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,237
I insist on a return game
today, Colonel Harris

189
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,871
I've never understood how anyone
could be proud to be German

190
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,516
If I had my way, I'd be on a plane
bound for America today

191
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,436
You find that hard to understand

192
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,993
I think the war was a waste of time

193
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,673
It's how you would feel if you were
to attend the good Father's Mass

194
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,790
The ceremony might be colourful,
even entertaining...

195
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,671
...but to an unbeliever it's simply
a sophisticated waste of time

196
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,077
Shoddy too, when the sacrament
is nothing but a dry cracker

197
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,232
She's flirting with you

198
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,799
A bit scheming, don't you think?

199
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,316
Why not dance with her?

200
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,238
Not today, I'm a little tired

201
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,558
It's time, Max. The Jew is here

202
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,357
Marie...

203
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,389
Bring me those silly papers

204
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,989
They're the rules

205
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,471
I must ask, do you know this man?

206
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,517
Max Hartmann is my friend. He gave
me food and hid me in his cellar

207
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,153
No more!

208
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,790
I won't do it again

209
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,152
Do what you like!

210
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,353
Is it my move?

211
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,468
What am I doing? No...

212
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,070
I think I'll retire now

213
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,353
No need to disturb
the Father and Alex

214
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,033
Good night to you both

215
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,999
Good night, father

216
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,033
Your uncle has always
been a good man

217
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,069
Don't forget that
whatever happens...

218
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,513
...you must always do
what you think is right

219
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,756
Never let anyone tell you otherwise

220
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,189
Katharina...

221
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,319
Put the lamp out

222
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,955
The lamp

223
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,519
I am a werewolf!

224
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,512
Yes, I'm afraid I have to admit
you have won

225
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,591
It's just a game

226
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,715
It's time to go home, Colonel

227
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,830
Do you have a moment?
We need your help

228
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,550
I beg you, Herr Leopold,
come with me

229
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,675
Be careful

230
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,714
Welcome, Herr Kessler

231
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,198
I can understand that this set-up
might puzzle you somewhat

232
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,473
But this sector is in a
state of emergency...

233
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:48,232
...and the authorities won't allow us
to give Max a proper burial

234
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,510
Gatherings are forbidden,
Herr Kessler

235
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,555
Therefore we must resort to this...

236
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,950
...most unworthy arrangement

237
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,996
We will proceed with our ceremony
in secret...

238
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,915
...like the Christians
in the catacombs

239
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,915
Everyone is gathering at the old
marshalling-yard at Darmstadt

240
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,351
Your job is to stop the train there...

241
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,956
...so that we can get the coffin
off the train

242
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,676
You've pulled the emergency brake!

243
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,355
Herr Leopold!

244
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,830
Over here

245
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,877
Kat is a lovely girl

246
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,396
I just wanted to thank you

247
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,274
My nephews' journey
went splendidly

248
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,233
What would they have done
without you?

249
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,119
Our superiors appreciate your help
in the Ravenstein assassination

250
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,675
We have a new job in mind for you

251
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,633
There's your girlfriend

252
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,675
Listen, Leo

253
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:07,155
I'm not asking you to
decide right now

254
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,395
We will offer Herr Kessler
a ride back to Frankfurt

255
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,278
Then we must fix the back door

256
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,234
It sticks

257
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,591
You have a visitor

258
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,599
- I hope I'm not intruding
- Not at all

259
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,953
Have you been promoted yet?

260
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,475
My exam is in a few weeks

261
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,671
What are you doing in Munich?

262
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,635
I'm at St Christopher's Church

263
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,473
I've come...

264
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,589
I've come to ask you not to
judge Kat too harshly

265
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,079
I know that she told you
about her mistake

266
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,430
Kat is confused, as so many
others are these days

267
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,955
But she is not a werewolf

268
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,150
She repents her sins and is trying
very hard to make amends

269
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,835
She had to flee from those people
in Frankfurt. They stop at nothing

270
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,400
Max Hartmann received
threatening letters

271
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,149
His collaboration with the
Americans was no secret

272
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,634
And after he died, the authorities
confiscated his entire estate

273
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,112
Do you have any contact with Kat?

274
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,830
I really must go now.
We will meet again

275
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,073
Herr Kessler, if I were you...

276
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,838
...l'd attend the Midnight Mass
at St Christopher's tonight

277
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,748
With this ring I thee wed

278
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,148
In the name of the Holy Trinity

279
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,439
I'm afraid the young Herr Hartmann
wasn't as co-operative as yourself

280
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,440
But then, what's one faggot less?

281
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,352
We've taken her to a
temporary hiding place

282
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,990
We thought you'd be more
co-operative if she was with us

283
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,713
I'm so glad you came, Leopold.
We can discuss your next job

284
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,909
We would like the Bremen line
to be shut down, tonight

285
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,151
You're a capable man

286
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,830
We're sure you can handle
a big job like this

287
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,079
All you have to do is place some
explosives underneath your sleeper

288
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,471
The bomb will be detonated
on the Neuwied Bridge

289
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,710
You'll have ample time to get out

290
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:11,153
I'm sorry to press you like this,
because I do like you

291
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,269
Remember, tonight you're
going on the Bremen Express

292
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,517
Allow me to present the examinee:
Leopold Kessler, my nephew

293
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:37,275
Herr Seifert and Inspector Stelemann
are in charge of the examination

294
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,159
There is a practical
and a theoretical part

295
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,476
First, we'll ask some questions

296
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,313
Then we will accompany you...

297
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,473
...to see how you manage with both
the passengers and the equipment

298
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:54,668
The conductor must be both
polite and firm at all times

299
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,350
Accompany us to compartment 9
and we can begin

300
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,795
Has this exam taken you
by surprise?

301
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,591
No, it's just that I was attending to
one of the passengers

302
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,439
If you don't mind, I'll just finish what
I was doing and be back at once

303
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:04,351
They want you to place a bomb.
Listen to me!

304
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,638
Tell him your life is at stake

305
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,553
I can't say any more

306
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,030
They're watching you, remember

307
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,032
Checkpoint Urmitz!

308
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,239
The external examiner is
getting a little impatient

309
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,038
I think we had better proceed
with the examination

310
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,668
So, we would like to know
what you would do...

311
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,515
...if the cleaner handed you
a green card...

312
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,478
...filled in like this

313
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,552
Have you gone completely mad?

314
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,716
Get out of here this instant!

315
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,311
My nephew's behaviour
cannot be excused

316
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:09,712
My first thought was to advise you
to cancel the exam at once

317
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,910
- Do you wish to proceed?
- That is up to the examiner

318
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,550
I shall repeat my question

319
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,473
What would you do if the cleaner...

320
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,916
...handed you a green card
filled in like this?

321
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,388
Can't you see it's filled in
incorrectly?

322
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,312
Completely incorrect

323
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,113
Would you like to tell the examinee
the correct answer to the question?

324
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,320
It's a trick question

325
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,629
The answer is:
Report the cleaner immediately!

326
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:13,557
The green card should never be
in the cleaner's possession

327
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,516
The cleaner never keeps any
papers for the conductor

328
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,078
On the contrary, the conductor
must give him a receipt...

329
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,391
...as soon as he takes over

330
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,438
And which form is used for this?

331
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,950
Yes, B, that is correct

332
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,118
And now a question after
Herr Seifert's own heart

333
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,751
What is stated in paragraph 4,
section 62 of the rule book?

334
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,914
I must inform you that an open collar
is against the regulations

335
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,113
Your uncle kindly got a card for you

336
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,075
We now want you to make bed 42

337
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,148
I have put the correct number
of bedding covers out for you

338
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,955
You may begin when I say so

339
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:28,999
We want you to make the bed twice

340
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,720
Then we will examine the bed

341
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,314
Are you ready with the clock?

342
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,790
You may now begin

343
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,433
The clock is ticking

344
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,117
The clock is ticking!

345
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,192
No time for that

346
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,153
The clock is ticking

347
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,270
Hurry, Herr Kessler,
the clock is ticking

348
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,679
The clock is ticking!

349
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:05,989
Thank you

350
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,839
Herr Kessler

351
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:52,799
Would you please come to
compartment 9 for a moment?

352
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,115
I was told I might find
the conductor here

353
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,716
I have a problem. Is it too much
to ask for a bit of service?

354
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,716
We must be quiet

355
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:33,558
The external examiner needs to rest
before we proceed with the exam

356
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,440
Let me give you a piece of advice

357
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,631
In my opinion, you have
only one chance

358
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:51,309
When Herr Seifert wakes up, ask him
to follow you through the train...

359
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:55,792
...as you give each of the passengers
an unconditional apology

360
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,909
Conductor!

361
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,752
These shoes need polishing

362
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,556
I wanted them polished

363
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,513
I am sure the shoes
have been polished

364
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,993
I don't think so,
there's no chalk mark

365
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,120
You'd better watch your step!

366
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,555
You pulled the emergency brake!

367
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,919
Refreshments?

368
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,759
Bedmaking?

369
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,639
Shoe-shine?
