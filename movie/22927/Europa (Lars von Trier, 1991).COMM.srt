1
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:26,315
<i>I'm Lars, and I'm sitting here</i>
<i>with Peter Aalbæk, who is</i> - 

2
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:30,519
<i>Well, how were you involved</i>
<i>in this film?</i>

3
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,426
<i>Well,</i>

4
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:38,935
<i>I think I was</i> - <i>I was probably</i>
<i>what you'd call a producer.</i>

5
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:43,599
<i>A producer?</i>
<i>Not an executive producer?</i>

6
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,407
<i>As you probably remember, I'd just</i>
<i>gone bankrupt with my company,</i>

7
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:53,017
<i>which had received</i>
<i>the first money for the film.</i>

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,189
<i>- And the money just disappeared?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

9
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,422
<i>You and Niels Vørsel</i>
<i>got the money,</i>

10
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:05,291
<i>but the Film Institute told me they</i>
<i>wouldn't let me produce the film.</i>

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,767
<i>- They didn't stick to that decision.</i>
<i>- They probably should have.</i>

12
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:19,605
<i>Then we were told that we had</i>
<i>to find some new investors.</i>

13
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:25,308
<i>We sent the script to Per Holst,</i>
<i>your former executive producer.</i>

14
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:32,253
<i>Yes, and somehow it didn't fit</i>
<i>into his "repertoire plans."</i>

15
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,725
<i>After having produced</i>
The Element of Crime -

16
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,791
<i>Which he lost a lot of money on.</i>

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,495
<i>Our script was lying on</i>
<i>his table for six months,</i>

18
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,901
<i>when we finally got a letter</i>- 

19
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:55,673
<i>It was a standard letter, and at the</i>
<i>bottom of the page they'd written</i>

20
00:01:55,882 --> 00:02:00,251
<i>that "it didn't fit into the</i>
<i>repertoire plans of Per Holst Film. "</i>

21
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,911
<i>What kind of executive producer</i>
<i>has a repertoire plan?</i>

22
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,623
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>Per Holst had at the time.</i>

23
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,456
<i>It didn't fit into his golf plans.</i>

24
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,031
<i>We also spoke to Metronome.</i>

25
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:20,867
<i>And Mads loved the script.</i>
<i>- They all did.</i>

26
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:25,977
<i>The most interesting concerning this</i> - 
<i>Do you remember Metz?</i>

27
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,580
<i>Yeah, Metz,</i>
<i>goddamn it, that was</i> - 

28
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,448
<i>Metz had this interesting viewpoint.</i>

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:38,056
<i>He thought</i>
<i>it was a very interesting project,</i>

30
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,659
<i>but he wouldn't</i>
<i>invest any money in it.</i>

31
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,319
<i>It didn't fit into his</i>
<i>repertoire plans either.</i>

32
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,524
<i>We were having lunch,</i>

33
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:54,173
<i>which I paid for</i>- 
<i>Or did he actually pay for it?</i>

34
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,400
<i>Film consultants</i>
<i>never buy you anything.</i>

35
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,341
<i>They just want the receipt,</i>
<i>but they never buy you anything.</i>

36
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:06,417
<i>Anyway, he told me</i>
<i>how much he liked the script,</i>

37
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:13,991
<i>and then he said that he would</i>
<i>never invest any money in the film.</i>

38
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,755
<i>The next day I went to Nordisk Film</i>

39
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,762
<i>and told Bahs</i>
<i>we wouldn't get any money.</i>

40
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:27,202
<i>Then he said, "It's been discussed at</i>
<i>a meeting this morning. It's okay. "</i>

41
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:34,370
<i>Apparently, all the big bosses at</i>
<i>Nordisk Film went to these meetings.</i>

42
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:40,679
<i>In the credits it says:</i>
<i>"George Metz helped finance this film."</i>

43
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:46,382
<i>I've never spoken to Metz about it,</i>
<i>but it was a dramatic change in</i> - 

44
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:52,089
<i>But then again, I'd only heard</i>
<i>him say that he wouldn't support it.</i>

45
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,790
<i>Because he wanted</i>
<i>to make the film</i> Sofie.

46
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:01,099
<i>When Nordisk Film decided to support</i>
<i>that film, he supported this one.</i>

47
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:05,243
<i>- Was it a "package deal"?</i>
<i>- Definitely.</i>

48
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,075
<i>Isn't that wrong and</i>
<i>something you should never do?</i>

49
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:15,243
<i>Well, the Film Institute refused to</i>
<i>make a deal on the Dogme films,</i>

50
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,582
<i>because we asked them directly.</i>

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,920
Europa <i>and</i> Sofie <i>were</i>
<i>the results of an unofficial request.</i>

52
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,926
<i>There's Ernst-Hugo!</i>

53
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,826
<i>Oh, now you're talking</i>
<i>about the film?</i>

54
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,498
<i>There's a film studio in Ystad</i>
<i>called "Ernst-Hugo."</i>

55
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:40,839
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Sweet Ernst-Hugo. I miss him.</i>

56
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,783
<i>"You may embrace me."</i>

57
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,458
<i>Back then, Jean-Marc still had</i>
<i>a few sticky locks.</i>

58
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,623
<i>Since then,</i>
<i>it's gone from bad to worse.</i>

59
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,853
<i>The technical</i>- 

60
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:02,933
<i>You can't tell they're walking</i>
<i>on a moving platform here, right?</i>

61
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,435
<i>Well, why bother making it</i> - 

62
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,440
<i>If you can't tell it's fake?</i>
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

63
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:15,876
<i>I believe the background is from</i> - 

64
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:20,951
<i>We talked about Breslaw, Wroclaw</i>- 
<i>Or was it Stettin?</i>

65
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:28,958
<i>Well, all the backgrounds are shot</i>
<i>in Poland and this is a back projection.</i>

66
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,029
<i>It's a front projection.</i>

67
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,395
<i>This is a Henning Bahs set.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

68
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:43,701
<i>And we used the city hall windows</i>
<i>from an old Olsen Gang film.</i>

69
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,472
<i>Bahs was very proud of this.</i>
<i>In one of the Olsen Gang films</i>

70
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,242
<i>they're looking through</i>
<i>the windows of the city hall.</i>

71
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,977
<i>He pulled them out of storage</i>

72
00:05:55,188 --> 00:06:00,592
<i>and they probably charged us</i>
<i>a lot of money to let us use them.</i>

73
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,387
<i>I know we would have.</i>

74
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:07,589
<i>- Don't talk about "us" as if</i>- 
<i>- As if we're a unity?</i>

75
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,362
<i>Especially right now.</i>
<i>Did you see that detail?</i>

76
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,907
<i>By the way, that was Leif Magnusson,</i>
<i>now we're talking about</i> - 

77
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,673
<i>The detail was the mirror which</i>
<i>is covered when it's brought in.</i>

78
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,544
<i>I've never seen that before.</i>

79
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:30,689
<i>No, but we saved you the trouble</i>
<i>of making a hidden camera.</i>

80
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,452
<i>You don't know this, but we try</i>
<i>really hard to minimize the expenses.</i>

81
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,053
<i>To see Henning Bendtsen</i>
<i>behind the box.</i>

82
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,529
<i>Behind a Panavision camera.</i>

83
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:46,967
<i>Yes, and that camera type</i>
<i>is called a Panaflex.</i>

84
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,237
<i>And it's shot in Panavision.</i>
<i>- I see.</i>

85
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,782
<i>Ernst-Hugo was a nice guy.</i>

86
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,992
<i>Yes, he was.</i>

87
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,890
<i>I'd seen him</i>
<i>in a Swedish television series</i>

88
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,659
<i>where he played a red-haired police</i>
<i>officer who'd killed his parents.</i>

89
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:22,000
<i>We needed a Swedish actor because</i>
<i>the Swedes helped finance the film.</i>

90
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,567
<i>You've always been great at that.</i>

91
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:32,273
<i>And it was very peculiar that</i>
<i>a taxi from Lidingö to the airport</i>

92
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:40,449
<i>could cost 1,305 Swedish kroner.</i>
<i>That record still stands.</i>

93
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,323
<i>We've worked with</i>
<i>Philip Zandén and other Swedes</i> - 

94
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,933
<i>He's never managed</i>
<i>to spend that much on a taxi.</i>

95
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,663
<i>But I've always been told to</i>
<i>believe the things people tell me.</i>

96
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,740
<i>This is a split screen</i>
<i>with a model of a dormitory.</i>

97
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,403
<i>Yes, I remember that.</i>
<i>The model.</i>

98
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,709
<i>It was difficult to make.</i>
<i>We should have just used a real dormitory.</i>

99
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,147
- <i>With a lot of beds.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

100
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,584
<i>I'm sure Ernst-Hugo</i>
<i>spat in his face there.</i>

101
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:16,418
<i>This was the common</i> - 
<i>What kind of head did we use here?</i>

102
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:22,795
<i>What are those heads called that</i>
<i>you can operate by remote control?</i>

103
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:28,668
<i>- Do you think we used them here?</i>
<i>- I'm not sure.</i>

104
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,869
<i>Later, when they walk around inside</i>
<i>the house, we used that apparatus.</i>

105
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,977
<i>It's almost standard nowadays.</i>
<i>The young people</i> - 

106
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,848
<i>- They have all the latest technology.</i>
<i>- And know how to use it.</i>

107
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:50,628
<i>Look. There we use</i>
<i>an extended silhouette effect.</i>

108
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:55,490
<i>That was back when</i>
<i>the pictures mattered to you.</i>

109
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:01,840
<i>What's her name?</i>
<i>- It's Vera Gebuhr.</i>

110
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,477
<i>She's been in all my films.</i>

111
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:13,884
<i>Most of the actors claimed that</i>
<i>they were fluent in German,</i>

112
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,112
<i>but she was one of the only ones</i>
<i>who actually spoke the language.</i>

113
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,051
<i>In</i> Dancer <i>Paprika Steen told me</i>
<i>she could speak English.</i>

114
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,095
<i>That was also interesting.</i>
<i>- That was a lie!</i>

115
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:31,534
<i>Her mother is American,</i>
<i>and therefore she thought</i> - 

116
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,204
<i>That was quite funny.</i>

117
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:41,845
<i>And Jørgen Reenberg thought</i>
<i>he mastered German perfectly.</i>

118
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,948
<i>Yes, he thought</i>
<i>he was infallible.</i>

119
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,920
<i>It was because he spoke German</i>
<i>to his dog, as hunters often do.</i>

120
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:59,564
<i>- And he was really good at it.</i>
<i>- Yes,</i> "hinter" <i>and</i> "Sitz."

121
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,734
<i>Look! Now we're</i> - 
<i>- Back in Poland.</i>

122
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:11,337
<i>When we shot these backgrounds</i>
<i>we hadn't found all the actors yet.</i>

123
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:16,174
<i>This is, of course,</i>
<i>a front projection.</i>

124
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:23,788
<i>But the extras,</i>
<i>or the stand-ins, we used</i> - 

125
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,892
<i>Later on we had to find some actors</i>
<i>who looked like those extras.</i>

126
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:33,626
<i>Well, that approach</i>
<i>might be as good as any.</i>

127
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,325
<i>Who was he?</i>
<i>The guy to the right?</i>

128
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:42,496
<i>He was a cultural official</i>
<i>in some German city.</i>

129
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:47,202
<i>- He was really good.</i>
<i>- He wasn't an actor.</i>

130
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,382
<i>He was a cultural official,</i>
<i>whatever that means.</i>

131
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:02,328
<i>Many of the actors were</i>
<i>reluctant to participate in the film.</i>

132
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:10,431
<i>You weren't that hot back then.</i>

133
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,163
<i>Neither was the producer.</i>

134
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,706
<i>That was what united us then.</i>

135
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,745
<i>Our despondency and lack of</i>
<i>sympathy from the world around us.</i>

136
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:28,079
<i>And from one another. And now we've</i>
<i>reached the end of a curve again.</i>

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:36,120
<i>A curve. And you try to curve</i>
<i>your way around</i> - 

138
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,786
<i>What's it called</i> - <i>the thing</i>
<i>that moves the trains around?</i>

139
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,391
<i>The turntable.</i>
<i>It symbolizes our cooperation.</i>

140
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:47,299
<i>I stand with the handle and you just</i>
<i>stand there talking nonsense.</i>

141
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:54,509
<i>No, he talks about</i>
<i>the sleeping car, which</i> - 

142
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,910
<i>Here are all</i>
<i>the freezing cold, Polish children.</i>

143
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,115
<i>The problem here was</i>

144
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,986
<i>that they're pulling a real carriage.</i>

145
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,324
<i>We put a small locomotive behind it</i>
<i>to help push it forward,</i>

146
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,159
<i>but they could</i>
<i>easily pull it themselves,</i>

147
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,336
<i>thus we had to add</i>
<i>an extra carriage.</i>

148
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,303
<i>Apparently, it's very easy</i>
<i>to pull such a carriage.</i>

149
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,999
<i>Ten men could pull it</i>
<i>by themselves.</i>

150
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:30,843
<i>Well, you must take off your hat</i>
<i>to the art of engineering.</i>

151
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,421
<i>Yes. It caught us by surprise.</i>
<i>Even Henning Bahs was surprised.</i>

152
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:45,764
<i>That wasnt the carriage.</i>
<i>No, we bought one.</i>

153
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,958
<i>We never used the carriage.</i>
<i>That one has just been painted on.</i>

154
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,198
<i>We bought the interior of a carriage.</i>

155
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:00,037
<i>Bahs bought the interior of</i>
<i>a carriage for 10 dollars in Poland.</i>

156
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,806
<i>Ernst-Hugo drops a tear there.</i>

157
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:21,259
<i>Do you remember that the investors</i>
<i>demanded we make it in color?</i>

158
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:26,236
<i>- No, I haven't seen any colors yet.</i>
<i>- They appear later on.</i>

159
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:32,735
<i>No, I don't remember.</i>
<i>Once more, the director has</i> - 

160
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,177
<i>Cheated the investors.</i>

161
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,873
<i>I thought you talked</i>
<i>about my loss of integrity.</i>

162
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,645
<i>You've claimed that I've lost it</i>
<i>so many times since.</i>

163
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:50,358
<i>No, they demanded it become</i>
<i>a color film, and then you said,</i>

164
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:57,025
<i>"Okay, we'll make four shots</i>
<i>in color, end of story. "</i>

165
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,672
<i>It was a bit more</i> - 

166
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,107
<i>- That was very resolute.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

167
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,103
<i>Look!</i>

168
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:13,581
<i>That carriage is made up of</i>
<i>the detached parts bought in Poland.</i>

169
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:19,891
<i>It was a beautiful carriage,</i>
<i>which had been</i> - 

170
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:25,462
<i>Bahs made sure that all the parts</i>
<i>of the carriages could be removed.</i>

171
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,792
<i>We installed the camera</i>
<i>in the ceiling</i>

172
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,596
<i>so the carriage could move</i>
<i>from side to side,</i>

173
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:39,074
<i>without touching</i>
<i>the camera suspension.</i>

174
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,807
<i>I'm sure we've got</i>
<i>some pictures of it somewhere.</i>

175
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,817
<i>From time to time,</i>
<i>I was rocking the carriage.</i>

176
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:57,326
<i>You moved it with a big beam,</i>
<i>using "the principle of the lever."</i>

177
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:04,628
<i>I did it with Jørgen Johansen, who</i>
<i>became our cameraman later on.</i>

178
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,137
<i>He probably should have stuck</i>
<i>with the beam.</i>

179
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,332
<i>He'd found his niche there.</i>

180
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:18,840
<i>- Those</i> - 
<i>- Those kids were quite interesting.</i>

181
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:24,512
<i>An elderly lady from the Polish Film</i>
<i>School rehearsed with those kids.</i>

182
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:28,955
<i>After each take,</i>
<i>she picked out five children</i>

183
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,530
<i>and then she slapped them because</i>
<i>their acting was unsatisfactory.</i>

184
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:39,102
<i>She kept on doing this, and they</i>
<i>actually became better and better.</i>

185
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:43,537
<i>Maybe we should use that</i>
<i>technique on Danish schoolchildren.</i>

186
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,408
<i>She was very consistent.</i>
<i>You, you, you and you.</i>

187
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:53,941
<i>After she'd slapped them,</i>
<i>they all acted really well.</i>

188
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,620
<i>And their cheeks were very red.</i>

189
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:04,128
<i>The incident with the conductor</i>
<i>who gets drunk</i>

190
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,891
<i>is something I've experienced</i>
<i>myself on a sleeping car</i>

191
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,233
<i>where I met a conductor, who was bald,</i>
<i>German and very punctilious.</i>

192
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:21,175
<i>For the first time ever, I was asked</i>
<i>what I wanted for breakfast.</i>

193
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,339
<i>And he wrote everything down.</i>

194
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,648
<i>I gave him my passport and my ticket.</i>
<i>Everybody adored him.</i>

195
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:36,055
<i>Then he suddenly disappeared,</i>
<i>and we didn't see him again.</i>

196
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,197
<i>Until the next morning</i>
<i>when two men forced open his door.</i>

197
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,030
<i>He'd been drinking all the booze,</i>
<i>and they carried him off at Cologne.</i>

198
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,196
<i>But apparently</i>
<i>that's quite common there.</i>

199
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,207
<i>There she is!</i>

200
00:16:53,379 --> 00:17:00,217
<i>I remember your first meeting,</i>
<i>where you both got really agitated.</i>

201
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:06,619
<i>Your first meeting with Barbara Sukowa</i>
<i>ended in a fierce argument.</i>

202
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,350
<i>Normally I don't yell, but</i> - 

203
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,790
<i>I don't remember that.</i>
<i>- It was because</i> - 

204
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:22,570
<i>On the same trip, I picked up</i>
<i>Barbara and Jean-Marc at the airport.</i>

205
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,610
<i>And he said he wanted his character</i>
<i>to be more intellectual.</i>

206
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,975
<i>There we have some</i>
<i>of the beautiful color pictures.</i>

207
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:39,222
<i>We must have thinned out the colors.</i>
<i>How did we do that?</i>

208
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,623
<i>I don't know. It was probably</i>
<i>expensive to do, don't you think?</i>

209
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,492
<i>We probably used the lab on</i>
<i>Nordisk Film and this was the result.</i>

210
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,434
<i>We asked them to develop it</i> - 

211
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,337
<i>"Do as you normally do."</i>
<i>Then it gets that Eastern European look.</i>

212
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,435
<i>It had to be in full color.</i>

213
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:08,018
<i>If you don't ask them for specific things,</i>
<i>this is what you get.</i>

214
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:14,985
<i>What was the Russian</i>
<i>negative called? Deva, or</i>- 

215
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:21,258
<i>It's crystal clear compared to this.</i>
<i>The Russian one.</i>

216
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:28,106
<i>The background is black and white,</i>
<i>the foreground is in color.</i>

217
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:32,471
<i>Well, it would be difficult to make it</i>
<i>the other way around here.</i>

218
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:37,515
<i>This is due to the investors who</i>
<i>insisted we make a color picture.</i>

219
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:45,022
<i>In this scene they walk in and out,</i>
<i>and it was really difficult to shoot.</i>

220
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,629
<i>- The two hanged people, remember?</i>
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

221
00:18:54,833 --> 00:19:00,669
<i>We wrote it laterally reversed, as</i>
<i>it was to be reflected in the window.</i>

222
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,671
<i>Everything had been</i>
<i>meticulously storyboarded.</i>

223
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:09,543
<i>And we could only do it this way</i>
<i>and write it laterally reversed,</i>

224
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:15,243
<i>because back then you couldn't</i>
<i>manipulate the reflection.</i>

225
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:28,060
<i>Or maybe we had two signs.</i>
<i>And the second time,</i>

226
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:34,536
<i>we wrote it laterally reversed so</i>
<i>we could superimpose it afterwards.</i>

227
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,109
<i>- But the dead bodies looked great.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

228
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:46,250
<i>They just disappeared, and we'd</i>
<i>paid 75,000 Danish kroner for them.</i>

229
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:51,081
<i>We could have found a Pole who</i>
<i>would have let us kill him for less.</i>

230
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,325
<i>That's the way it is,</i>
<i>when you're unfamiliar with the area.</i>

231
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,429
<i>We had a little incident with</i>
<i>the two bodies.</i>

232
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:08,095
<i>We were bringing them home,</i>
<i>and we had to reload them</i> - 

233
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:12,607
<i>That was later used as the logo</i>
<i>of the film company Zentropa.</i>

234
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,713
<i>You'd written some</i>
<i>scary-looking letters across it.</i>

235
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:22,086
<i>It was really funny,</i>
<i>and people were laughing at it.</i>

236
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:26,419
<i>But since our next films were</i>
<i>so boring, we had to change the logo.</i>

237
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:32,287
<i>That logo indicated</i>
<i>some sort of drive.</i>

238
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,058
<i>And then it was followed by</i>
<i>a deadly dull Scandinavian film.</i>

239
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,661
<i>No, that didn't really correspond.</i>

240
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,608
<i>Here we have a dissolve, which is</i> - 

241
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,175
<i>Look!</i>
- <i>Hell yeah.</i>

242
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,342
<i>Now Jean-Marc's</i>
<i>got something to think about.</i>

243
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,621
<i>This is where he tries to make his</i>
<i>character seem more intelligent</i> - 

244
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,850
<i>Can you see the sign to the right?</i>

245
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,692
<i>It's to the left of the window</i>
<i>and it says "Steckenpissestrasse."</i>

246
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,289
<i>No, I never noticed that</i> - 

247
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:14,964
<i>Bahs said that in the bars in Munich</i>
<i>people often pissed on their barstool legs.</i>

248
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:19,269
<i>And that's called "Steckenpisse."</i>
<i>- Yes, but I couldn't see it.</i>

249
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,369
<i>No. Well, it was, of course</i> - 

250
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,278
<i>Well, it was a mere</i>
<i>request from the producer.</i>

251
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,179
<i>Those things always</i>
<i>wind up in the dark.</i>

252
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:33,248
<i>In this film, it's easy</i>
<i>to hide things in the dark.</i>

253
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,863
<i>Here they're driving a car.</i>
<i>They actually drive in many of the scenes.</i>

254
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,101
<i>And we were working so hard</i>
<i>to shake all the different parts.</i>

255
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,102
<i>That was before we realized</i>
<i>that we could just shake the camera.</i>

256
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:06,551
Let me tell you,
it is most frightening.

257
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,758
<i>His left ear is very bright.</i>

258
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,527
<i>And it looks a little square.</i>

259
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,702
<i>The symbolism is</i> - 

260
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:29,541
<i>He tries to appear more intellectual</i>
<i>by letting his ears shine.</i>

261
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:34,447
<i>He was a nice kid.</i>
<i>That shot, goddamn it!</i>

262
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,145
<i>It took ages to do that shot.</i>

263
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,727
<i>Overtime, overtime, overtime.</i>
<i>600% overtime.</i>

264
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:50,391
<i>We wanted the shadow on the wall</i>
<i>to be projected through lith film.</i>

265
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,160
<i>Do you know what "lith film" is?</i>

266
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:58,639
<i>You shoot footage and convert it</i>
<i>to a deep contrast look</i>

267
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:04,009
<i>by copying it onto lith film.</i>
<i>Look. The train is down below.</i>

268
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,549
<i>Beautiful. After all,</i>
<i>it was relatively difficult</i> - 

269
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,584
<i>It was extremely difficult.</i>

270
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:14,248
<i>The rails had to look right, because</i>
<i>they couldn't be changed afterwards.</i>

271
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,327
<i>- No, no, no.</i>
<i>- No, they couldn't.</i>

272
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,657
<i>In the old days, you had to</i> - 

273
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:32,939
<i>He needs to keep the light close by,</i>
<i>otherwise he can't read the note.</i>

274
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:38,242
<i>If the light is placed right in front</i>
<i>of your eyes you can't see a thing.</i>

275
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:44,515
<i>The kid looks tired.</i>
<i>It's probably the 56th take,</i>

276
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,750
<i>and Ernst-Hugo</i>
<i>has just slapped him.</i>

277
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:52,021
<i>Once he became furious</i>
<i>and left the shoot</i>

278
00:23:52,230 --> 00:24:00,535
<i>because he didn't get the room</i>
<i>he normally had when visiting Denmark.</i>

279
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:07,975
<i>During another take, where he stood</i>
<i>on a box, he also left the set.</i>

280
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,116
<i>Then I told him we should have</i>
<i>used Max von Sydow instead.</i>

281
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:18,051
<i>- That wasnt quite</i> - 
<i>- The gentleman didn't agree.</i>

282
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,918
<i>The box just stood there.</i>

283
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,789
<i>- Shit, it's your former wife.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

284
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:29,161
<i>She was tough when</i>
<i>it came to negotiating her salary.</i>

285
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,963
<i>I bet she was. But you finally</i>
<i>did reach an agreement, right?</i>

286
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:39,132
<i>Well, she's in the film, right?</i>
<i>And there's Jønke.</i>

287
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,547
<i>He spoke German fluently.</i>

288
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,284
<i>The people</i>
<i>who did his dubbing said</i>

289
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,291
<i>it was impossible to follow</i>
<i>his mouth movements in German.</i>

290
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:02,030
<i>Somehow he had</i>
<i>these mouth spasms</i> - 

291
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,761
<i>And he forgot his lines.</i>
<i>He was terrible.</i>

292
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:10,874
<i>He was difficult to handle.</i>
<i>- Couldn't he remember his lines?</i>

293
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:15,445
<i>No, that's why it was so pathetic.</i>
<i>He spoke German fluently,</i>

294
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:21,142
<i>but he couldn't remember his lines.</i>
<i>And his acting was terrible.</i>

295
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,344
<i>What were the extenuating</i>
<i>circumstances again?</i>

296
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,320
<i>Maybe that it was Jørgen?</i>
<i>And there's Udo.</i>

297
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,158
<i>He was so pretty.</i>
<i>And we mustn't forget Erik Mørk.</i>

298
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:42,363
<i>He played the Father.</i>
<i>- He died shortly after this.</i>

299
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,338
<i>He spoke German fluently,</i>
<i>and he knew his lines.</i>

300
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:50,174
<i>And somehow we didn't have</i>
<i>any problems with him.</i>

301
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,648
<i>With a group of actors like these</i> - 
<i>and later we'll see</i> - 

302
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:58,812
<i>- Eddie.</i>
<i>- Eddie Constantine and Ernst-Hugo.</i>

303
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:04,587
<i>Somehow they pick</i>
<i>their different roles.</i>

304
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,526
<i>One is difficult, one is funny, et cetera.</i>

305
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:13,932
<i>The good thing about Jørgen was</i>
<i>that he was the only troublemaker.</i>

306
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:21,238
<i>And we could just dub him.</i>
<i>- And nobody tried to take his place.</i>

307
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:26,110
<i>- Even Barbara was almost kind.</i>
<i>- They were all meek as lambs.</i>

308
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:37,223
<i>Erik had these long monologues.</i>
<i>- He knew them by heart.</i>

309
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:45,626
<i>- He'd probably read the script.</i>
<i>- He was a very meticulous man.</i>

310
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:54,604
<i>Did you make your former wife</i>
<i>play servant on purpose?</i>

311
00:26:54,813 --> 00:27:00,649
<i>She was also in</i> Epidemic
<i>where she played a nurse.</i>

312
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:05,312
<i>She had a permanent job elsewhere</i>
<i>during both films,</i>

313
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:11,291
<i>so she probably just wanted</i>
<i>to make some extra money.</i>

314
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:23,640
<i>And the sideboard and the table</i>
<i>are from</i> Matador.

315
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:31,404
<i>I can recognize</i>
<i>this dining room set from</i> Matador.

316
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:36,519
<i>You can recognize it because we got</i>
<i>an invoice from Nordisk Film.</i>

317
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:43,794
<i>This was difficult,</i>
<i>because we had to move backwards.</i>

318
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,831
<i>Out and</i> - 
<i>- And Jørgen forgot his lines.</i>

319
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,937
<i>Stop it. You werent even there.</i>

320
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,235
<i>But you were there</i> - 
<i>- When things had to be rocked.</i>

321
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:08,012
<i>We superimposed</i>
<i>an explosion in the background.</i>

322
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,892
<i>"The Americans are clever."</i>

323
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,802
<i>By the way, Erik Mørk was a Catholic,</i>
<i>thus the role was perfect for him.</i>

324
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:39,044
<i>"Pathetic, at best,"</i>
<i>as Claes Kastholm would have said.</i>

325
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,078
<i>We could say the same thing</i>
<i>about his life and his career.</i>

326
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,384
<i>We probably shouldn't get into that.</i>

327
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:52,689
<i>I've mentioned it on all</i>
<i>the commentaries I've done so far.</i>

328
00:28:54,432 --> 00:29:00,268
<i>Claes Kastholm is a recurrent</i>
<i>figure on these commentaries.</i>

329
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:05,170
<i>- There comes the train.</i>
<i>- It's called a "trolley."</i>

330
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,905
<i>It's called a "bogie."</i>

331
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,141
<i>- Then what's a "trolley"?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

332
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:19,284
<i>Anyway, there was a wipe,</i>
<i>and we used that a lot when editing.</i>

333
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,553
<i>- And you did those with Gislason.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

334
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,627
<i>You could say that.</i>

335
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,426
<i>Oh, and here</i> - 
- <i>Here he comes.</i>

336
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,699
<i>Yes, he does.</i>

337
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:42,074
<i>He said this long line without</i>
<i>checking the cardboard signs at all.</i>

338
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,051
<i>I remember Reenberg</i> - 

339
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:54,123
<i>Eddie was an American,</i>
<i>but he corrected him nevertheless.</i>

340
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,223
<i>He didn't think his American accent</i>
<i>was quite right.</i>

341
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:07,297
<i>Jørgen needed to remove</i>
<i>the attention from his own German.</i>

342
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,736
<i>I think he was quite</i>
<i>satisfied with his German.</i>

343
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,742
<i>Sometimes Eddie fell asleep</i>
<i>during the shoot.</i>

344
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:25,751
<i>He loved to sit</i>
<i>in his uniform on the stage.</i>

345
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,458
<i>He realized</i>
<i>he could be an actor,</i>

346
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:37,124
<i>when he managed to evade military</i>
<i>service during World War II.</i>

347
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:44,434
<i>He realized that his special gift</i>
<i>was to pretend things.</i>

348
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:49,670
<i>- I see.</i>
<i>- At first, he was a bar pianist.</i>

349
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:54,978
<i>At the medical, he realized</i>
<i>that he could limp his way out of it.</i>

350
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,947
<i>Then he thought, "I'll make this</i>
<i>my living, "and then he went</i> - 

351
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,457
<i>There's the windows from</i>
<i>the Olsen Gang film once more.</i>

352
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:08,291
<i>- Third invoice, same copy.</i>
<i>- Yes, the third invoice.</i>

353
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:17,538
<i>And there were people pulling</i>
<i>those sticks. My, we were busy.</i>

354
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:31,515
<i>It was difficult to zoom in on Kier</i>
<i>because of the anamorphic optics.</i>

355
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,817
<i>Our French assistant</i>
<i>had a fishing rod</i> - 

356
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,826
<i>He used more money on tape,</i>
<i>than we did on his salary.</i>

357
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,397
<i>He used 600 pieces per setting.</i>

358
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:49,270
<i>The camera is easily moved.</i>

359
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,840
<i>And the little details</i> - 

360
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,411
<i>Isn't the train passing by here?</i>

361
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,778
<i>I'm sure it's called a "bogie."</i>

362
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:06,218
<i>- I still believe it's a "trolley."</i>
<i>- Let's make a bet.</i>

363
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,521
<i>The company is at stake.</i>
<i>The loser gets the company.</i>

364
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:17,964
<i>Isn't a trolley the thing with the</i>
<i>handles they use in "Donald Duck"?</i>

365
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,798
<i>I'm not sure, but</i> - 

366
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,443
<i>I look forward to</i>
<i>the sex scene later on</i> - 

367
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:43,218
<i>to see Jean-Marc's</i>
<i>and Barbara's carnal lust.</i>

368
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,623
<i>And?</i>

369
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,164
<i>I won't reveal too much</i>

370
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,963
<i>before we see her</i>
<i>in the scene with the model railway.</i>

371
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,468
<i>- You never reveal anything, right?</i>
<i>- It's against my principles.</i>

372
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,340
<i>Right.</i>

373
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:11,147
<i>- You shouldn't ruin people's fun.</i>
<i>- Or jeopardize our earnings.</i>

374
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,191
<i>And a light breeze.</i>

375
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:21,925
<i>Look. The painters have made</i>
<i>the windows look all greasy.</i>

376
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:26,467
<i>Around the edges of the windows.</i>
<i>What's it called?</i>

377
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:32,268
<i>Shit! There he is.</i>
<i>He was really cranky here in the tub.</i>

378
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,967
<i>I remember it all too clearly.</i>

379
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,652
<i>He used to be a boxer,</i>
<i>and after that scene</i> - 

380
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:47,291
<i>- He wanted to punch you.</i>
<i>- He said, "Receive a punch."</i>

381
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,622
<i>To him it was almost</i>
<i>like talking slang.</i>

382
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,799
<i>He acted a bit crazy and</i>
<i>he actually treated me like a friend.</i>

383
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:02,963
<i>There's Henning Jensen.</i>
<i>He's been in many of your films.</i>

384
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,666
<i>This was before they threw Down syndrome</i>
<i>actors out of the Royal Danish Theatre.</i>

385
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,050
<i>Sweet Henning.</i>

386
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,332
<i>Those people in the background</i>
<i>probably worked at Nordisk Film.</i>

387
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,435
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>the line in the canteen.</i>

388
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,598
<i>Perhaps we've used some of</i>- 

389
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:41,404
<i>The fools working at Nordisk Film</i>
<i>at that time. There were quite a few.</i>

390
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,680
<i>Right.</i>

391
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:56,689
<i>- And the train is moving.</i>
<i>- We're busy with the beam here.</i>

392
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,370
<i>- A cute little detail.</i>
<i>- And Holger Perfort.</i>

393
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,212
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>he spoke German too.</i>

394
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:21,283
<i>The people from Nordisk were great.</i>
<i>But they always had to leave at noon.</i>

395
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,944
<i>There's our friend from</i>
The Element of Crime.

396
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,920
<i>He was a dramaturge</i>
<i>at the Swedish Film School.</i>

397
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:41,460
<i>Strange.</i>
<i>- Why did you use him?</i>

398
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:48,441
<i>He had a great face and he</i>
<i>looked like a specific type of Jew.</i>

399
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,376
<i>The kind Jew, which is</i>
<i>a controversial thing to say.</i>

400
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,953
<i>It's a beautiful set.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

401
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,093
<i>Jean-Marc looks like</i>
<i>he doesn't understand a word.</i>

402
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,660
<i>It's his way of showing</i>
<i>how intelligent his character is.</i>

403
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,535
<i>I've read the reviews doormen</i>.

404
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,435
<i>And the critic wrote</i>
<i>that Arden has managed</i>

405
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:24,480
<i>to get Jens Albinus to look</i>
<i>desperate in three different ways.</i>

406
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,892
<i>"Wöllstadt doesn't look too good." No.</i>

407
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,963
<i>The Jews have a lot of children.</i>

408
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,694
<i>Well, you need to keep up with</i> - 

409
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,499
<i>The extermination camps?</i>
<i>Well, this was after the war.</i>

410
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,075
<i>- There will be other wars.</i>
<i>- You're probably right.</i>

411
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,580
<i>- He was good at yelling.</i>
<i>- And Baard Owe.</i>

412
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:15,522
<i>They're removing the heaters.</i>
<i>War debts to Scandinavia.</i>

413
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,566
<i>A funny detail.</i>
<i>- Yes, it was.</i>

414
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:31,506
<i>- He seems worried.</i>
<i>- Now Jean-Marc acts.</i>

415
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:37,416
<i>- Here we look in from the outside.</i>
<i>- And there's smoke and steam.</i>

416
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,716
<i>This scene must have been</i>
<i>extremely difficult to make.</i>

417
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,228
<i>And the silhouettes look right.</i>

418
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,300
<i>- For how many weeks did we shoot?</i>
<i>- An infinite number of weeks.</i>

419
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:58,464
<i>I don't think it was that bad.</i>
<i>Wasnt it about 14 weeks?</i>

420
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,737
<i>Well, nobody had bothered</i>
<i>to direct the actors anyway.</i>

421
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,280
<i>At that time,</i>
<i>that was a mere detail.</i>

422
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,282
<i>That was before that kind</i>
<i>of nonsense became in fashion.</i>

423
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,587
<i>Bang! Then there's a train.</i>

424
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:22,562
<i>I think Gislason shot this scene.</i>
<i>It was a part of their second unit.</i>

425
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,637
<i>He wanted to become</i>
<i>a director, right?</i>

426
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,774
<i>Yes, what happened to him?</i>
<i>Is he still in the business?</i>

427
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,608
<i>I've been told,</i>
<i>he's still "newcomer of the year."</i>

428
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,578
<i>Then they're just left there.</i>

429
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:57,964
<i>We rented all the weapons</i>
<i>and the uniforms in France.</i>

430
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,538
<i>We had to spend some money there.</i>
<i>German uniforms from France.</i>

431
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,800
<i>That makes a lot of sense.</i>

432
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:12,108
<i>The French have always been very</i>
<i>Nazi-like, so it does make sense.</i>

433
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:18,016
<i>Vichy and the like.</i>
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

434
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:23,250
<i>The short one lives in Denmark.</i>
<i>What's his name?</i>

435
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,460
<i>In a moment, we'll see our most</i>
<i>challenging front projection.</i>

436
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,467
<i>It's the one with the bullet</i>
<i>which he drops.</i>

437
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:46,080
<i>We did a front projection</i> - 
<i>or rather a back projection</i>

438
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:51,846
<i>which was two inches by one.</i>
<i>It was incredibly small.</i>

439
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,684
<i>It's right there.</i>
<i>Well, it's somewhat larger than I thought.</i>

440
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:00,330
<i>No, the front projection</i>
<i>is very small, well</i>- 

441
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:04,558
<i>Look. Foreground and background.</i>
<i>- It's beautiful.</i>

442
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,432
<i>We made the bridge there</i> - 

443
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,042
<i>That night the entire railway service</i>

444
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,907
<i>in the southwest of Poland</i>
<i>had been suspended.</i>

445
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,039
<i>Yes, they were quite nice about it.</i>

446
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:23,516
<i>Those two extras</i>
<i>had been flown in from France.</i>

447
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:30,054
<i>They were there for 30 minutes.</i>
<i>We listed them as two French actors</i>

448
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:35,630
<i>in order to get the money from CMC.</i>
<i>It was really clever thinking.</i>

449
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:50,478
<i>Max von Sydow is also in the film.</i>
<i>He talks</i> - 

450
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:56,142
<i>Right, but we don't talk</i>
<i>about him here.</i>

451
00:40:56,353 --> 00:41:00,983
<i>No, because, as usual,</i>
<i>we're only listening to ourselves.</i>

452
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,953
<i>He was lying down.</i>
<i>We made</i> - 

453
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,131
<i>He was lying on his back in order to</i>
<i>make his voice as deep as possible.</i>

454
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,668
<i>Per Streit, the sound designer</i>- 

455
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:18,968
<i>Look! We pan him out</i>
<i>and the background is almost in sync.</i>

456
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:28,412
<i>Here we didn't succeed.</i>

457
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,519
<i>Well, that's how it is.</i>

458
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,521
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>It creates a little life.</i>

459
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,056
<i>For sure.</i>

460
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:38,161
<i>But you wouldn't do it</i>
<i>like this on a computer today.</i>

461
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:41,991
<i>No. But then again, it probably</i>
<i>wouldn't have the same charm.</i>

462
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:51,198
<i>His lines caused him a lot of trouble here.</i>
<i>There were signs everywhere.</i>

463
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,010
<i>Well, it's difficult</i> - 

464
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:00,611
I insist on a return game today,
Colonel Harris.

465
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,883
<i>Jønke looks a little angry.</i>

466
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,117
<i>He looks at his watch.</i>
<i>He wants to go home.</i>

467
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,422
...could be proud to be German.

468
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:18,200
<i>Udo brought different things</i>
<i>to the halfway point party.</i>

469
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:24,307
<i>He was stopped by the customs</i>
<i>officers with his inflatable dolls.</i>

470
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:28,274
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>when he fell down the stairs?</i>

471
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:33,513
<i>Head first. He was really drunk.</i>
<i>A sweet guy.</i>

472
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,552
...even entertaining,

473
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:41,557
but to a disbeliever it's simply
a sophisticated waste of time.

474
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,952
Shoddy too, when the sacrament
is nothing but a dry cracker.

475
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,262
She's flirting with you.

476
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,168
A bit scheming, don't you think?

477
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,631
Why not dance with her?

478
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,731
Not today. I'm a little tired.

479
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,778
<i>This film is too storyboarded,</i>

480
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,576
<i>so there wasnt really</i>
<i>any way out of</i>- 

481
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:12,586
<i>When the storyboard was made, you felt,</i>
<i>you'd already made the film.</i>

482
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:18,057
<i>And, as far as I remember,</i>
<i>it was almost identical with the film.</i>

483
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,231
<i>The shots looked almost identical.</i>

484
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:25,198
<i>- Where's the storyboard now?</i>
<i>- I think we've misplaced it.</i>

485
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,930
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>we'll find it again.</i>

486
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,472
<i>Well, you won't find</i>
<i>much passion in this film.</i>

487
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,280
<i>Look, there he is, in person.</i>

488
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,080
<i>Shit yeah.</i>

489
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,779
<i>The eternal Jew.</i>

490
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,600
<i>"The Jew is</i> - <i>"</i>

491
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,271
<i>He's not happy about this.</i>

492
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,165
<i>At this point, did you still believe</i>
<i>you were Jewish?</i>

493
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,677
<i>No, the reason why</i>
<i>they are called Hartmann</i> - 

494
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,907
<i>Right. It had been revealed</i>
<i>by that time</i> - 

495
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:18,319
<i>I was the only one who knew.</i>
<i>My mother had just died.</i>

496
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:24,518
<i>And your biological father visited you</i>
<i>while you wrote the script.</i>

497
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,186
<i>Oh, yes, that's how it was.</i>

498
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:30,699
<i>- On your Amiga computer.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

499
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:35,132
<i>His name was Hartmann,</i>

500
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,639
<i>and Cæcilia thought it would be fun</i>
<i>if the family was called Hartmann.</i>

501
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,471
<i>Katharina Hartmann.</i>

502
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,052
<i>Look! Oh, no!</i>

503
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:55,552
<i>That was called</i>"Persilscheins."

504
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,460
<i>You needed somebody to sign</i>
<i>a document</i>

505
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,827
<i>to prove that you werent a Nazi.</i>

506
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,959
I must ask, do you know this man?

507
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,362
Max Hartmann is my friend.

508
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,564
<i>I, too, insisted</i>
<i>that I spoke German fluently.</i>

509
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:48,711
<i>They dubbed me, and I never</i>
<i>forgave Jørgen Reenberg for that.</i>

510
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:52,746
<i>No, it was the other way around.</i>
<i>- They dubbed him too.</i>

511
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,784
<i>- I met him in Nærum, and</i> - 
<i>- He didn't understand why?</i>

512
00:45:56,987 --> 00:46:03,449
<i>He just looked far into</i>
<i>the distance when he passed me.</i>

513
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:16,063
<i>Hear the violins. Your brother-in-law</i>
<i>was in charge of the music.</i>

514
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,710
<i>Yes. Look, here we have a nice shot.</i>
<i>A real Bahs shot.</i>

515
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,880
<i>It was his kind of film.</i>

516
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,210
<i>It really was.</i>

517
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,908
<i>We made it because of him.</i>

518
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:40,790
<i>And while he stands there,</i>
<i>we go through here.</i>

519
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:42,966
<i>Look.</i>

520
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:48,368
<i>And Søren Gam and Peter Grant</i>
<i>are removing the different parts.</i>

521
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,806
<i>It was really great.</i>
<i>- At that time.</i>

522
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,810
<i>At the film school</i>
<i>people just loved those things.</i>

523
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,574
<i>Søren Gam loathed physical labor.</i>

524
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:03,583
<i>He probably just whispered</i>
<i>"now" to the others.</i>

525
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,217
Is it my move?

526
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,627
What am I doing? No.

527
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,334
I think I'll retire now.

528
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,142
No need to disturb
the Father and Alex.

529
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,872
Good night to you both.

530
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,906
Good night, Father.

531
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,382
Your uncle has always
been a good man.

532
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,284
Don't forget that
whatever happens -

533
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:51,860
<i>That's typical Jørgen. He touches</i>
<i>your shoulder when he leaves.</i>

534
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:56,733
<i>It's something actors do</i>
<i>to get all the attention.</i>

535
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:03,140
<i>You couldn't see it.</i>
<i>If the scriptwriter wants to get rid of them,</i>

536
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,645
<i>they try to avoid this</i>
<i>by touching each other's shoulders.</i>

537
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:13,520
<i>If his line is</i> - 
<i>people will focus on the wrong things.</i>

538
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,929
<i>Right, there was a secret door here.</i>

539
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,463
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

540
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:27,504
<i>It was the same place the guy</i>
<i>from</i> Matador <i>fucked the girl.</i>

541
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,536
<i>This was the place</i>
<i>they fucked in</i> Matador.

542
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,277
<i>It was Moesgård.</i>

543
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,175
<i>Holger Juul.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

544
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,775
<i>That nice man.</i>

545
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:50,250
<i>We'd made a system with different</i>
<i>beams, which went down here.</i>

546
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:58,298
<i>We did a camera move which</i>
<i>followed the radius of the crane.</i>

547
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,202
<i>Yes, it had to meet</i>
<i>the technical limitations.</i>

548
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:10,304
<i>The beams were operated by 10 men.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, you can't see it.</i>

549
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:16,643
<i>The film format doesn't allow it.</i>
<i>Well, here we go.</i>

550
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,311
<i>That's right.</i>

551
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:22,290
<i>They often carry lamps around</i>
<i>despite the bright light.</i>

552
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,757
<i>Yes, but what the hell.</i>

553
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,488
<i>Look. Now.</i>

554
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:36,095
<i>It's a railway family.</i>

555
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:41,437
<i>And then we go down</i> - 
<i>It looks old-fashioned.</i>

556
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:47,550
<i>And down into the bathroom.</i>
<i>And we don't just stay there, but</i> - 

557
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:55,816
<i>Oh, I thought there was</i>
<i>a back projection, but</i> - <i>Yes, look.</i>

558
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,290
<i>At that point,</i>
<i>we used my hands,</i>

559
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:04,627
<i>because Jønke was so annoying</i>
<i>that we had to send him home.</i>

560
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,702
<i>If I'd known that, I would have</i>
<i>sharpened the knife even more.</i>

561
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,233
<i>We borrowed one part of</i>
<i>the model railway from Märklin.</i>

562
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,803
<i>And Søren Gam</i>
<i>built the other part.</i>

563
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:22,112
<i>Did Märklin exist before the war?</i>
<i>They probably did.</i>

564
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:27,985
<i>I'm sure they produced things which</i>
<i>could be used in the war industry.</i>

565
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,126
<i>You're probably right.</i>
<i>Toy trains.</i>

566
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:36,960
<i>They trained small children</i>
<i>to perform different tasks.</i>

567
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,035
<i>Jønke and the special effects crew</i>
<i>argued about this scene.</i>

568
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,628
<i>Yes, I remember that.</i>

569
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:49,706
<i>He walked around</i>
<i>with wires covered in blood.</i>

570
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,973
<i>Goddamn it.</i>
<i>- It was very difficult.</i>

571
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:59,614
<i>The atmosphere was quite tense...</i>

572
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:04,355
<i>because we didn't know</i>
<i>how intense the love scene would be.</i>

573
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:09,589
<i>I don't remember. Look!</i>
<i>The blood comes from down below,</i>

574
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,066
<i>and we've turned</i>
<i>the camera upside down.</i>

575
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:19,898
<i>That was the only way</i>
<i>we could get this shot.</i>

576
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,706
<i>It was extremely complicated.</i>
<i>- Well, you managed to do it.</i>

577
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:29,784
<i>Yes, and nowadays it</i>
<i>would have been a piece of cake.</i>

578
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:34,047
<i>Today young people can do</i>
<i>everything on their computers.</i>

579
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:39,388
<i>Thus, it's wise of them to refrain</i>
<i>from making films like this one.</i>

580
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:47,867
<i>That model railway cost</i>
<i>300,000 - 400,000 kroner.</i>

581
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,408
<i>Nowadays, you can shoot a few</i>
<i>weeks for the same amount of money.</i>

582
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,476
<i>She's taken down her hair.</i>

583
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:03,048
<i>The buttons in her shirt</i>
<i>caused us great difficulties.</i>

584
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:07,053
<i>There were too many buttons,</i>
<i>so it's only every 10th that is buttoned.</i>

585
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:12,791
<i>It seems like she's already</i>- 
<i>- Unbuttoned some of them.</i>

586
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:33,411
<i>Every time you see a film you're sure</i>
<i>it was the most difficult to make.</i>

587
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:39,419
<i>But then again, it was difficult.</i>
<i>How much time did we have to shoot it?</i>

588
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:42,922
<i>Between 12 and 16 weeks.</i>

589
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:49,190
<i>And four weeks in Poland</i>
<i>with the backgrounds.</i>

590
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,926
<i>Sixteen weeks?</i>
<i>That's a long time.</i>

591
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:58,665
<i>Back then, all Danish films</i>
<i>were made in 14 weeks.</i>

592
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,877
<i>We were quite fast,</i>
<i>considering all our difficulties.</i>

593
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:06,879
<i>And you always complain</i>
<i>that I spend too much time.</i>

594
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:12,817
<i>Well, you had to raise the level</i>
<i>of efficiency. Even back then.</i>

595
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,025
<i>Right.</i>
<i>At least, it used to be that way.</i>

596
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:21,823
<i>One day we'll have</i>
<i>to make it faster than one to one.</i>

597
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,524
<i>That's when we have to make</i>
<i>a 90-minute film in 60 minutes.</i>

598
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,898
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>you'll ask me to do that one day.</i>

599
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:36,909
<i>In the name of industrialization,</i>
<i>we need to keep speeding things up.</i>

600
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,777
<i>Or you could need</i>
<i>to do slow motion.</i>

601
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:45,048
<i>She gives it all she's got, and I was</i>
<i>afraid she would ruin the trains.</i>

602
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,486
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>he cuts himself everywhere now.</i>

603
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:56,990
<i>What did we call this scene?</i>
<i>"The death of the woodcock"?</i>

604
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:03,771
<i>Jørgen told us</i>
<i>a touching story about the woodcocks.</i>

605
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:07,704
<i>When they lay dying in his hands</i> - 

606
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,710
<i>- They gave him a reproachful look.</i>
<i>- No, a grateful look.</i>

607
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,713
<i>Because they'd been killed</i>
<i>by such a great hunter.</i>

608
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,514
<i>And he tries to re-create</i>
<i>that feeling in the bathtub.</i>

609
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:26,793
<i>Maybe there's a woodcock</i>
<i>that has died that way once.</i>

610
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,397
<i>But I sincerely doubt it.</i>

611
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,935
<i>With so little dignity.</i>
<i>- It must have been very patient.</i>

612
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:42,044
<i>It had to wait for hours</i>
<i>before he hit it with the razor.</i>

613
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:46,648
<i>Woodcocks are difficult to shoot.</i>
<i>They fly in a zigzag course.</i>

614
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,718
<i>But if somebody knows how to do it,</i>
<i>it's Jørgen Reenberg.</i>

615
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,590
<i>There we have</i>
<i>the bloody windows once again.</i>

616
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,765
<i>I wish I'd never heard about them.</i>

617
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,339
<i>Maybe we ought to</i> - 
<i>Oh, here comes a great shot.</i>

618
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:17,138
<i>But I'd like to tell people the story</i>
<i>about why the film was even made.</i>

619
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:21,481
<i>The thing with the contract.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

620
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:29,157
<i>That was fun. It was just one</i>
<i>of the stunts on this production.</i>

621
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:35,964
<i>We'd begun to make the film</i>
<i>at Nordisk Film</i>

622
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,158
<i>in a halfhearted way.</i>

623
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,301
<i>And they were more</i>
<i>interested in making</i> Sofie.

624
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:48,271
<i>I kept getting new contracts.</i>

625
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:55,647
<i>All the contracts had a time limit,</i>
<i>and if I didn't meet it,</i>

626
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,652
<i>the deal would be canceled</i>

627
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,883
<i>and I wouldn't make</i>
<i>any money on it.</i>

628
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:09,532
<i>A lawyer from FAF</i>
<i>read the different contracts,</i>

629
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:13,362
<i>and they were very</i>
<i>discontented with this.</i>

630
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:20,476
<i>At some point,</i>
<i>Rubin invited me to a meeting.</i>

631
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:25,478
<i>Kolvig was there too.</i>
<i>- And Michael Havemann.</i>

632
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,249
<i>The genius</i>
<i>who had written the contract.</i>

633
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,021
<i>They wanted me to sign</i>
<i>a new contract.</i>

634
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:38,058
<i>I wanted FAF to check it,</i>
<i>but they said that I should just sign it.</i>

635
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:41,253
<i>Then I discovered that they'd forgot</i>
<i>to change the date,</i>

636
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:45,457
<i>thus if they didn't cancel</i>
<i>the film at midnight the same day,</i>

637
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:54,871
<i>they had to pay my entire salary.</i>
<i>They hadnt noticed this error,</i>

638
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,912
<i>and then I just signed the contract.</i>

639
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:03,575
<i>Then I met you and said,</i>
<i>"I think the film will be made now."</i>

640
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:08,690
<i>You and I sat by the phone until midnight,</i>
<i>but they didn't call.</i>

641
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:14,023
<i>Now Nordisk Film had to pay me,</i>
<i>whether I made the film or not.</i>

642
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:19,926
<i>- That was so much fun.</i>
<i>- Kolvig called me the next morning.</i>

643
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,907
<i>"Hello? Lars?"</i>

644
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,540
<i>"We've made</i>
<i>a small error in the contract.</i>

645
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,543
<i>Are you willing to ignore that?"</i>

646
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,912
<i>"Yes, but my lawyer won't."</i>

647
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,611
<i>I really looked forward</i>
<i>to saying that to him.</i>

648
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,090
<i>That way the film became a reality.</i>

649
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,718
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>we owe it all to Havemann.</i>

650
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,820
<i>It really is</i>
<i>Michael Havemanrs doing.</i>

651
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,399
<i>The law is behind everything.</i>

652
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,195
<i>Yes. It was.</i>

653
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,271
<i>What the hell.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

654
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,806
<i>There were many things</i> - 

655
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,070
<i>We promised Nordisk Film</i>
<i>to leave Germany alone.</i>

656
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,649
<i>They wanted to sell the film there</i>
<i>and make a lot of money.</i>

657
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:15,314
<i>Nevertheless, Philippe Bober helped</i>
<i>us sell the film to the Germans.</i>

658
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,857
<i>And Nordisk Film didn't know</i>
<i>anything about this.</i>

659
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:24,627
<i>A few weeks before the shooting started,</i>
<i>we were short of money,</i>

660
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,132
<i>and they wanted</i>
<i>to cancel the film.</i>

661
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:33,606
<i>Then we could show them</i>
<i>our secret contract.</i>

662
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:39,305
<i>This film is mainly the result of</i>- 

663
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,713
<i>Somehow, we managed</i>
<i>to wangle things.</i>

664
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:50,054
<i>Imagine if you hired</i>
<i>cads like us nowadays.</i>

665
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,162
<i>Today everything</i>
<i>is done by the book.</i>

666
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,891
- <i>Complete transparency.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

667
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:05,172
<i>We didn't see our favorite scene,</i>
<i>because we talked.</i>

668
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:10,403
<i>The crane shot where Ernst-Hugo</i>
<i>stood on the box in the end.</i>

669
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:15,175
<i>The crane shot, which goes</i>
<i>from the little train and up.</i>

670
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:20,254
<i>There were roofs that opened</i>
<i>and two cranes</i> - 

671
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:26,656
<i>He had that long monologue,</i>
<i>where he was moving from side to side.</i>

672
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,195
<i>We shot the scene</i>
<i>over and over again,</i>

673
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:33,665
<i>and right before we came to</i>
<i>Ernst-Hugo, I said, "Cut."</i>

674
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:41,709
<i>Finally, we got to him,</i>
<i>and then he forgot his lines.</i>

675
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:46,712
<i>I said we should</i>
<i>have used von Sydow instead,</i>

676
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,079
<i>and then he just disappeared.</i>

677
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:57,123
<i>This is the scene where I had to ask</i>
<i>the public to help us.</i>

678
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:01,525
<i>We told the media that we</i>
<i>needed AIDS and cancer patients.</i>

679
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,393
<i>I got in so much trouble for that.</i>

680
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:11,570
<i>People found it disgusting</i>
<i>that we wanted to use sick people.</i>

681
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:15,802
<i>We said we needed "skinny people."</i>

682
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:21,143
<i>We said we preferred sick people</i>
<i>because they are so skinny.</i>

683
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:26,482
<i>On the other hand, sick people</i>
<i>are rarely offered any jobs.</i>

684
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:30,420
<i>It's in fashion</i>
<i>to help minority groups,</i>

685
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,461
<i>and we ought to get an award</i>
<i>for our effort.</i>

686
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:43,098
<i>- It would have been nice.</i>
<i>- There's snow, movements and</i> - 

687
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:50,246
<i>None of your later films</i>
<i>were that complicated.</i>

688
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,015
Europa <i>is the most complicated one.</i>

689
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:56,684
<i>But it was less expensive to make.</i>
<i>It's very strange.</i>

690
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:01,323
<i>This is the same</i> - 
<i>No, yes, it is the same.</i>

691
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:08,327
<i>- There are projections on the sides.</i>
<i>- No, it's an optical bench.</i>

692
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:12,801
<i>- Paul</i>- 
<i>- Yes, what was his name?</i>

693
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:21,139
<i>What was his name?</i>
<i>In the optical bench room</i> - 

694
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:27,442
<i>And he always said it couldn't be done,</i>
<i>after we'd already done it.</i>

695
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:31,108
<i>He was often angry.</i>
<i>Almost like Uncle Kessler.</i>

696
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:37,386
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>On the other hand</i> - 

697
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,657
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

698
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,559
<i>This was the first day of shooting.</i>

699
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:53,640
<i>I showed it to Rubin and</i>
<i>Bo Christensen. They were furious.</i>

700
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:58,303
<i>- Yes, they werent impressed.</i>
<i>- The coffin looked too light.</i>

701
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,812
<i>That was their only comment.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

702
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:06,822
<i>It was 18 below,</i>
<i>and it was really awful.</i>

703
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,992
<i>And you shot</i>
<i>one of the crane shots yourself,</i>

704
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:16,098
<i>because the cameraman,</i>
<i>Edward Klosinsky, said it couldn't be done.</i>

705
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,359
<i>No, that wasnt the reason why.</i>

706
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,629
<i>You'll see the shot in a moment.</i>

707
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,933
<i>I asked him to do different things.</i>

708
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:30,408
<i>One of the shots is made sideways,</i>
<i>and maybe he let me do it,</i>

709
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,781
<i>because the Polish railways</i>
<i>were terribly bumpy.</i>

710
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:39,944
<i>I asked him to do</i>
<i>several different things,</i>

711
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:45,526
<i>and in the end he said,</i>
<i>"Why don't you just do it yourself?"</i>

712
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:49,858
<i>"Since you seem to know</i>
<i>everything yourself. "</i>

713
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,796
<i>No, I thought</i>
<i>he was being nice to me.</i>

714
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,403
<i>Later on, I realized that it was</i>
<i>because he was furious.</i>

715
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,439
<i>Here's the scene</i>
<i>with the light coffin.</i>

716
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:02,042
<i>That was the scene I shot.</i>

717
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:07,239
<i>When he asked me to do it,</i>
<i>I said, "I'd love to do it."</i>

718
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,614
<i>I'm shooting the scene,</i>
<i>and then it was just because</i>

719
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,883
<i>he was really mad at me.</i>

720
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:21,257
<i>Yes, the coffin looks too light,</i>
<i>but can you do it better yourselves?</i>

721
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,264
<i>It was incredibly difficult,</i>
<i>that shit.</i>

722
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:29,404
<i>If it had weighed 550 pounds,</i>
<i>you probably couldn't</i> - 

723
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,698
<i>Look at the snow we made.</i>

724
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,809
<i>There were</i>
<i>old locomotives everywhere.</i>

725
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,777
<i>When reading the script,</i>
<i>I wondered if we could afford it.</i>

726
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,915
<i>But we found</i>
<i>all these wrecks in Poland.</i>

727
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:47,654
<i>The plains were filled with</i>
<i>old locomotives.</i>

728
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,784
<i>Herr Leopold!</i>

729
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:55,893
Over here.

730
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,511
Kat is a lovely girl.

731
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,386
I just wanted to thank you.

732
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,148
My nephews' journey
went splendidly.

733
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:25,289
What would they have done
without you?

734
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:33,463
Our superiors appreciate your help
in the Ravenstein assassination.

735
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:39,007
<i>It was fun to watch the Germans</i>
<i>who dubbed the Danish actors.</i>

736
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:43,804
<i>They almost spoke like real actors.</i>

737
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:48,973
<i>They were great at it.</i>
<i>I think they did it in Rostock.</i>

738
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:53,087
<i>"The Rostock Theater."</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

739
01:04:55,925 --> 01:05:00,760
<i>This was difficult too.</i>
<i>We wanted to make the picture rotate</i> - 

740
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:05,059
<i>- Why did we make it so complicated?</i>
<i>- I have no idea.</i>

741
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,203
<i>Look. It took several hours.</i>

742
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:14,001
<i>- It's not even good. In theory</i>- 
<i>- In theory, it was great.</i>

743
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:18,544
<i>We wanted it to be as difficult as possible.</i>
<i>And it most certainly was.</i>

744
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:21,173
<i>- It's Gislasors fault.</i>
<i>- Of course it was.</i>

745
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,387
<i>He probably often regretted it</i>
<i>during the second unit shoot.</i>

746
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,085
<i>Those shots of the rails</i> - 

747
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:39,599
<i>They'd built a special train</i>
<i>in order to shoot that footage.</i>

748
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:46,367
<i>We'd been shooting for hours</i>
<i>when I went to see the result.</i>

749
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:51,706
<i>In the shots the rails werent</i>
<i>in the middle of the frame,</i>

750
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,781
<i>and the camera operator</i>
<i>asked me if it was okay.</i>

751
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,885
<i>"You must be joking.</i>
<i>On the storyboard they're in the middle. "</i>

752
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:06,494
<i>At that point, they'd been working</i>
<i>on the train for two weeks,</i>

753
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:08,664
<i>but they just</i>
<i>tore it apart after that.</i>

754
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,764
<i>This is a textbook example of</i>

755
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:18,134
<i>why you shouldn't place</i>
<i>a leading part in the background.</i>

756
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:23,904
<i>Ernst-Hugo is standing there singing</i>
<i>"Tannenbaum, Tannenbaum."</i>

757
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,742
<i>And he tries to attract</i>
<i>all the attention</i> - 

758
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,579
<i>From Erik Mørk's monologue.</i>
<i>This is the only take</i>

759
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:36,747
<i>where we don't see smoke</i>
<i>coming out of Ernst-Hugo's ears.</i>

760
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,428
<i>He tried all kinds of things.</i>

761
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:45,191
<i>He couldn't stand it</i>
<i>when the lens wasnt focused on him.</i>

762
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:51,169
<i>Well, I just think</i>
<i>it was a natural reaction.</i>

763
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,274
<i>He wanted to complete the shot.</i>

764
01:06:54,977 --> 01:07:02,315
<i>Once we tested if he could actually</i>
<i>stop being the center of attention.</i>

765
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:07,353
<i>I used a stopwatch and told him</i>
<i>to stay low for five minutes.</i>

766
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:10,719
<i>After three minutes</i>
<i>he was sound asleep.</i>

767
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:16,831
<i>- Only the eternal rest was left.</i>
<i>- His psyche couldn't handle it.</i>

768
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:18,456
Do you have any contact with Kat?

769
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:24,628
I really must go now.
We will meet again.

770
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:30,838
<i>- Several lines in German. He was</i> - 
<i>- He was really great.</i>

771
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,142
<i>Since Ernst-Hugo stood almost still,</i>
<i>we could actually use the scene.</i>

772
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:45,020
<i>At this point, I just prayed that</i>
<i>Ernst-Hugo would keep standing still.</i>

773
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,762
<i>Ernst-Hugo got cigars</i>
<i>if he behaved himself.</i>

774
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:01,306
<i>- Did he ever behave himself?</i>
<i>- He got one every day.</i>

775
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:06,504
<i>He kept them and the taxi bills</i>
<i>from the airport in his pocket.</i>

776
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,513
<i>This is the church.</i>

777
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:14,587
<i>Yes, and it's very much</i>
<i>inspired by</i> Vertigo,

778
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:18,248
<i>which all connoisseurs will know.</i>

779
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:23,228
<i>We shot some of it from above.</i>

780
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:33,038
<i>And we'd placed a huge,</i>
<i>unsteady wooden tower in the top.</i>

781
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:37,804
<i>But we went even higher</i>
<i>and shot this scene from there.</i>

782
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,972
<i>Tómas Gislason stood on the floor</i>
<i>and I operated the camera.</i>

783
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,415
<i>I asked him to move</i>
<i>people a little to the right.</i>

784
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:50,558
<i>Then Tómas said,</i>
<i>"I don't think so. Just shoot the scene."</i>

785
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:55,992
<i>It turned out that people</i>
<i>had gone on a strike,</i>

786
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,792
<i>and they were very unsatisfied</i>
<i>with the film company.</i>

787
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,770
<i>The Polish production team</i>
<i>had fled in a car,</i>

788
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:09,968
<i>and Tómas Gislason was all alone</i>
<i>with all those angry people.</i>

789
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,910
<i>It was right before the big change</i>
<i>of the political system.</i>

790
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:15,947
<i>"I don't think so", he said.</i>

791
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:20,111
<i>They were cold, hungry,</i>
<i>and they hadnt been paid for months.</i>

792
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,348
<i>There's a Plumrose tin</i>
<i>somewhere here.</i>

793
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,824
<i>Bahs ate the contents</i>
<i>and made a lamp of the tin.</i>

794
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:30,430
<i>It was a great sacrifice.</i>
<i>Considering how much he liked</i> - 

795
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,658
<i>It was mock turtle soup.</i>

796
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:37,703
<i>- From Beauvais?</i>
<i>- Yes, only the best is good enough.</i>

797
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,943
<i>- Is that a bridge?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

798
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:49,106
<i>It was extremely difficult to shoot.</i>
<i>There's snow in the background</i> - 

799
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:52,515
<i>Snow, water and darkness.</i>

800
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,189
<i>And leaves and</i> - 

801
01:09:56,492 --> 01:10:00,053
<i>In a moment, we'll see a sickly</i>- 
<i>That looked strange.</i>

802
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:08,328
<i>And our theory didn't hold water.</i>
<i>The leaves should go from his shot</i> - 

803
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,802
<i>And then they were</i>
<i>suddenly married.</i>

804
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:16,444
<i>The leaves landed in</i>
<i>the current under the bridge,</i>

805
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,871
<i>but they should have</i> - 
<i>I simply don't get it.</i>

806
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,711
<i>Now we'll see a small puff of air.</i>

807
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:29,490
<i>And then they should float</i> - 
<i>Come on, leaves!</i>

808
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,887
<i>There's not a single leaf.</i>

809
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,562
<i>Yes, there!</i>
<i>Well, not really.</i>

810
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:41,430
<i>And here's the most sickly dissolve</i>
<i>ever made in the history of films.</i>

811
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:46,571
<i>It's simply too much.</i>

812
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,743
<i>It's not... good.</i>

813
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,537
<i>And pigeons and whatnot?</i>

814
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:57,776
<i>It was in this church</i> - 
<i>Some of the footage was mislaid,</i>

815
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:03,391
<i>and you lit a candle</i>
<i>for "The Saint of Lost items."</i>

816
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:07,392
<i>The priest in the church</i>
<i>was a dreamer.</i>

817
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:12,624
<i>The church was ruined during the war.</i>
<i>It was a huge church.</i>

818
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:18,905
<i>He was named after a saint,</i>
<i>but I don't remember which one.</i>

819
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,508
<i>You can read it in the credits.</i>

820
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:26,977
<i>You pray to this saint</i>
<i>when you've lost something.</i>

821
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:30,743
<i>All Catholics, except me,</i>
<i>know whom I'm talking about.</i>

822
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:35,117
<i>Then we prayed and against</i>
<i>all odds we retrieved it.</i>

823
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:39,818
<i>It was terrible, because we thought</i>
<i>we'd lost some important shots.</i>

824
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:43,294
<i>He kept saying that the church,</i>

825
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:48,061
<i>which was nothing but a bit of rubble,</i>
<i>should be restored.</i>

826
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:53,333
<i>In the credits it said how you could</i>
<i>donate money to the restoration.</i>

827
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:58,502
<i>We put the information in the end,</i>
<i>but nobody reads all the credits.</i>

828
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,683
<i>- How much did we donate?</i>
<i>- Probably not that much.</i>

829
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:05,820
<i>But now we have a little film</i>
<i>we can show St. Peter.</i>

830
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:08,785
<i>"We did actually contribute."</i>

831
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,859
<i>But a few years ago</i>
<i>I spoke to a young man</i> - 

832
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:19,423
<i>a student at the Polish Film School,</i>
<i>who was born in that village.</i>

833
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:24,834
<i>Here we see two different hands.</i>
<i>The reflected image is wrong.</i>

834
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:31,138
<i>It was his village church,</i>
<i>and he had been inspired by our shoot.</i>

835
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,839
<i>I asked him, "What about the church?"</i>
<i>"It's been restored."</i>

836
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,677
<i>So miracles do happen.</i>

837
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:42,451
<i>- And maybe people</i> - 
<i>- Have read the credits.</i>

838
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:46,924
<i>They've sent money to the church.</i>

839
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:52,666
<i>Well, you'll know for sure</i>
<i>on the Day of Wrath.</i>

840
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,705
<i>Now she's in the mood for love.</i>

841
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:03,402
<i>In a moment we'll see</i>
<i>a Nordisk Film speciality. Rime.</i>

842
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:10,413
<i>Remember when Egon Olsen</i>
<i>sat in a freezer with his cigar?</i>

843
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,521
<i>It's the leftovers from that scene,</i>
<i>and we got yet another bill.</i>

844
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,331
<i>The copying machines</i>
<i>have been busy.</i>

845
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,831
<i>Damn right.</i>

846
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:30,330
<i>I really liked the rime.</i>
<i>We'll see it in a moment.</i>

847
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:34,942
<i>I think we did a crane move</i> - 
<i>as we always did.</i>

848
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:43,341
<i>After all, we've only had two shots</i>
<i>since the last difficult scene.</i>

849
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:48,921
<i>Yes</i> - 
<i>But was this really that difficult?</i>

850
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,195
<i>Here we spend some time</i>
<i>on the dialogue.</i>

851
01:13:56,965 --> 01:14:01,061
<i>You must be young and daring,</i>
<i>if you decide to make such a film.</i>

852
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,042
<i>It's here. Look.</i>

853
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:15,708
<i>There's rime on the window.</i>
<i>This is beautifully done.</i>

854
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,080
<i>That's so beautiful.</i>

855
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,677
<i>We're at Bergen-Belsen</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

856
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:24,885
<i>It's really beautiful.</i>
<i>And this is a</i> - 

857
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:28,824
<i>- A "Rodney Hall."</i>
<i>- We didn't have any in Denmark.</i>

858
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:33,161
<i>But if we look out the window now</i>
<i>we'll see nothing but Rodney halls.</i>

859
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:37,737
<i>We've already torn down 37 Rodney halls,</i>
<i>because they were rust-eaten.</i>

860
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,101
<i>Rodney designed them,</i>

861
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:44,973
<i>but I'm not sure the brick wall</i>
<i>was an authentic part of it.</i>

862
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:51,744
<i>- She's a bit frisky here.</i>
<i>- Yes, SS llsa.</i>

863
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:54,152
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>And she's got the iron in her hand.</i>

864
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,587
<i>That she does.</i>

865
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:18,041
<i>The shot doesn't make any sense.</i>
<i>We've overdone it.</i>

866
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:23,378
<i>There's no communication at all.</i>
<i>Oh, that's a classic movie scene.</i>

867
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:28,649
<i>But it's nice.</i>
<i>Henning Bendtsen, the DP,</i>

868
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:33,157
<i>made sure to soften her a bit.</i>

869
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:37,126
<i>I was very impressed</i>
<i>by his light test of her.</i>

870
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,562
<i>She came to Denmark</i>

871
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:44,501
<i>because the director of photography</i>
<i>and the leading lady</i>

872
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:45,971
<i>were like the big</i> - 

873
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:47,166
<i>It was a big deal.</i>

874
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:50,712
<i>We'd put out many</i>
<i>different lights for the test,</i>

875
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:55,577
<i>but he only used a 60-watt bulb.</i>

876
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:59,914
<i>He waved it in front of her face</i>
<i>for 15 seconds.</i>

877
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:04,422
<i>"Thank you. That'll be all."</i>
<i>Then she went back home.</i>

878
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,720
<i>I've never heard about</i>
<i>a light test before.</i>

879
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:13,163
<i>It was very important that he knew</i>
<i>how she looked with</i> - 

880
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,928
<i>"Thank you. That'll be all."</i>

881
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,538
<i>It was very impressive.</i>

882
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,708
<i>He was of the old school.</i>

883
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:34,249
<i>Here we used the crane which</i>
<i>was operated by remote control.</i>

884
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,117
<i>What was it called?</i>

885
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:39,682
<i>The entire film</i>
<i>was made with a gear head.</i>

886
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:46,792
<i>It was the first one in Scandinavia.</i>
<i>What's it called?</i>

887
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,368
<i>A remote</i> - 

888
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:53,371
<i>Probably something with "cam."</i>
<i>Something with "cam."</i>

889
01:16:54,476 --> 01:17:00,210
<i>There lies Udo</i>
<i>on a crochet blanket.</i>

890
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:05,549
<i>He probably crocheted it himself.</i>
<i>- If not, he would have loved to.</i>

891
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,654
<i>He crocheted all of it.</i>

892
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:14,991
<i>He was nasty</i>- 
<i>The darkest hours of the war.</i>

893
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,166
<i>We've used a cubistic pattern here.</i>

894
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:34,475
<i>"All you have to do is place some</i>
<i>explosives underneath your carriage. "</i>

895
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:39,052
<i>It doesn't get any easier than that.</i>
<i>He's got an Adolf hairdo.</i>

896
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,678
<i>He sure does.</i>

897
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,089
<i>Here we go.</i>

898
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:52,130
<i>That's the shoeshine</i>
<i>from the main station.</i>

899
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,302
<i>Our friend,</i>
<i>who's been in several films.</i>

900
01:17:56,004 --> 01:18:00,304
<i>There's Claus Flygare.</i>
<i>With brushed-back hair.</i>

901
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,440
<i>Directly from the Mammut Theater.</i>

902
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,882
<i>Yes, known from</i>
<i>the Mammut Theater.</i>

903
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,356
<i>An unforgettable scene.</i>

904
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:25,326
<i>Ernst-Hugo is already cross.</i>
<i>And I don't blame him.</i>

905
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:32,497
<i>He's received a parcel.</i>
<i>- He's cross because of the bomb.</i>

906
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,506
<i>He's already unwrapped it,</i>

907
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:40,648
<i>and it doesn't meet</i>
<i>the requirements for real bombs.</i>

908
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,480
<i>What were those</i>
<i>sleeping cars called?</i>

909
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,689
<i>I can't remember a thing.</i>

910
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:50,780
<i>What they were called?</i>

911
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:55,192
<i>What was the inventor</i>
<i>of the sleeping car called?</i>

912
01:18:56,598 --> 01:19:00,659
<i>Niels and I have laughed at</i>
<i>my forgetfulness so many times.</i>

913
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,836
<i>And I can't remember the name.</i>

914
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:11,139
<i>They mention it in the film</i> - 
<i>- There's "front and back pussy."</i>

915
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:12,705
<i>Erno Müller.</i>

916
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:17,942
<i>- Or "top pussy."</i>
<i>- No, "back and top pussy."</i>

917
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:21,782
<i>And Benny Poulsen.</i>
<i>He died recently.</i>

918
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:30,724
<i>- Erno Müller</i>- 
<i>- He had many theories.</i>

919
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:36,768
<i>Yes, and as a counterpart</i>
<i>to "dick and swelled dick,"</i>

920
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:40,430
<i>you had "back and top pussy."</i>

921
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:46,638
<i>I never figured out</i>
<i>how those two things were paired.</i>

922
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:53,818
<i>I met him at the film school,</i>
<i>where he taught us about those things.</i>

923
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:56,718
<i>You were young men and you didn't</i>
<i>know anything about those things.</i>

924
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:02,486
<i>That's one of the best lines.</i>

925
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,670
<i>And we still feel the same way.</i>

926
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:14,067
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

927
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:19,612
<i>Maybe he ought to check</i>
<i>that paper-wrapped parcel.</i>

928
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,443
<i>The wrapping paper, yes.</i>

929
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,986
<i>Here comes the classic movie shot</i>
<i>taken from above.</i>

930
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:28,315
<i>We had to lay down</i>
<i>the entire scenery.</i>

931
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:29,856
<i>I really don't remember that</i> - 

932
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,721
<i>At the point</i>
<i>where they hold hands.</i>

933
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,920
<i>It is so very beautiful.</i>

934
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:39,633
<i>Why did it have to be laid down?</i>
<i>- Otherwise we couldn't make it.</i>

935
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,769
<i>We couldn't make</i>
<i>the back projection</i> - 

936
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,428
<i>Oh, no, of course not.</i>

937
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:46,837
<i>We got the front from a British guy.</i>

938
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:49,442
<i>Right, it was a front projection.</i>

939
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:55,178
<i>The difference between a front</i>
<i>and a back projection is purely technical.</i>

940
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,308
<i>Either it comes from</i>
<i>the front or from the back.</i>

941
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:01,515
<i>It's the exact same thing with</i>
<i>a top and a back pussy.</i>

942
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:07,754
<i>But the definition is unclear.</i>
<i>- It's kind of blurry now.</i>

943
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:18,330
<i>The definition of top and back pussy</i>
<i>depends solely on fashion and taste.</i>

944
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:21,943
<i>Look at that.</i>

945
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,476
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

946
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:27,975
<i>Sentimental music.</i>

947
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:32,843
<i>It was difficult to shoot that scene</i>
<i>from another train.</i>

948
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:38,588
<i>Gislason and I had to change it</i>
<i>one night where I was extremely drunk.</i>

949
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:44,026
<i>It was the last night,</i>
<i>and the Poles had got me drunk.</i>

950
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:49,670
<i>Gislason fought a heroic battle,</i>
<i>all by himself.</i>

951
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:57,209
<i>He made it as a reshoot.</i>
<i>- I see. A reshoot?</i>

952
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:01,109
<i>We'd shot the train</i>
<i>when it went the wrong way.</i>

953
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:07,780
...what you would do if the cleaner
handed you a green card

954
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:11,857
filled in like this.

955
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,954
<i>Now he has to hurry.</i>

956
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:22,296
<i>Another crane shot. There are quite</i>
<i>a few camera moves in this film.</i>

957
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:27,567
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>Do you think we're in Urmitz now?</i>

958
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,609
<i>I guess somebody is trying</i>
<i>to tell us something.</i>

959
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:36,876
<i>We didn't hear the narrator, but he</i>
<i>probably said, "We're in Urmitz now."</i>

960
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:41,612
<i>Finally, just to be on the safe side,</i>
<i>it's included in somebody's line.</i>

961
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,557
<i>It's not that easy to get through</i>
<i>the carriage with that bomb.</i>

962
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:54,225
<i>What's the MP called?</i>
<i>- Michael Simpson.</i>

963
01:22:54,436 --> 01:23:01,774
<i>He was in</i> Epidemic,
<i>where he talked about "tight pussies."</i>

964
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:05,845
<i>And he falls into Mølleåen</i>
<i>to the sound of Wagner.</i>

965
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:10,441
<i>That was a pool</i>
<i>in Fredensborg Slotspark.</i>

966
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:15,954
<i>- He's good with his hands.</i>
<i>- Yes, he's great with bombs.</i>

967
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:20,025
<i>According to Bahs, it's plastic</i>
<i>explosives when you do it like that.</i>

968
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:21,595
<i>He knew about that.</i>

969
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,966
<i>He is quite busy</i>
<i>on the platform in Urmitz.</i>

970
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:30,035
<i>Somebody took his hat.</i>
<i>That's really great.</i>

971
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:35,198
<i>It's really funny.</i>
<i>It's the only funny thing in this film.</i>

972
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:39,870
<i>Somebody took his hat.</i>
<i>That's funny.</i>

973
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:43,847
<i>Why did he take his hat?</i>
<i>- I have no idea.</i>

974
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:48,989
<i>That's a beautiful model.</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

975
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:53,388
<i>It was huge.</i>
<i>About 16 - 21 yards.</i>

976
01:23:55,063 --> 01:24:00,194
<i>- Look. It's a Hellesen.</i>
<i>- Yes, I thought so.</i>

977
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:04,736
<i>The Hellesen factory is in Køge.</i>
<i>On "Tiger Road,"of course.</i>

978
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:08,966
<i>And what's that?</i>
<i>A small watch?</i>

979
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,140
<i>Now he just needs to set it.</i>

980
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:21,854
<i>Ernst-Hugo is soon dying</i>
<i>to get some attention.</i>

981
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:23,947
<i>- He's hid the bomb well.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

982
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:29,258
<i>No one will find it there.</i>

983
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:33,491
<i>And once again</i>
<i>the railway service was suspended</i>

984
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:37,193
<i>for four nights</i>
<i>in the southern part of Poland.</i>

985
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,772
<i>People were freezing and</i>
<i>the train service had just stopped.</i>

986
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:46,174
<i>You probably won't find cups</i>
<i>hanging like that in other trains.</i>

987
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:53,583
<i>In that case, you need to make sure</i>
<i>that the cups don't touch each other.</i>

988
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,951
<i>What was the story</i>
<i>with the handkerchief?</i>

989
01:24:57,158 --> 01:25:00,616
<i>Oh, yes, you had to keep</i>
<i>your head covered.</i>

990
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:05,392
<i>His examination depended on it.</i>
<i>It's something from my Jewish past.</i>

991
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:08,830
<i>You must cover your head</i>
<i>when visiting a Jewish graveyard.</i>

992
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,666
<i>So there you were,</i>
<i>with a handkerchief.</i>

993
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:14,037
<i>So you used a handkerchief</i>
<i>if you'd forgotten</i> - 

994
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:16,140
<i>Your hat.</i>

995
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:21,805
<i>This scene is extremely beautiful.</i>

996
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:25,543
<i>I think Søren Gam arranged</i>
<i>the grass he's lying on here.</i>

997
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:33,653
<i>- It's very beautiful, and the</i> - 
<i>- He looks up upon the stars.</i>

998
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:38,529
<i>It's inspired by</i>
The Night of the Hunter.

999
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:44,402
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>We had to improvise here.</i>

1000
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:50,567
<i>We made a frame of grass</i>
<i>and shot it from the bottom of it.</i>

1001
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:56,148
<i>It's beautiful. We could have used</i>
<i>shots like that in our thriller.</i>

1002
01:25:56,351 --> 01:26:02,722
<i>If you hadnt revealed the ending.</i>
<i>- Nature, grass</i> - 

1003
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,219
<i>The best films are never made.</i>

1004
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:10,729
<i>The most mythological projects.</i>

1005
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,528
<i>And there was a shooting star.</i>

1006
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:18,072
<i>I didn't plan it that way,</i>
<i>but it looks like it.</i>

1007
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:23,233
<i>This was extremely difficult to shoot.</i>
<i>That's a stuntman.</i>

1008
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,072
<i>He's running on a bridge,</i>

1009
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:31,184
<i>and there's nothing but slats.</i>
<i>If he falls, he ends in the water.</i>

1010
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:35,789
<i>Right behind him there's</i>
<i>a small train carrying the camera.</i>

1011
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:41,622
<i>- It's at night, and it's freezing.</i>
<i>- It was extremely dangerous.</i>

1012
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:48,864
<i>We did use safety advisers.</i>
<i>They didn't care about the stuntman,</i>

1013
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:53,598
<i>but they wouldn't allow people</i>
<i>to sit on top of the train.</i>

1014
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:58,575
<i>Then I told them we would leave.</i>
<i>We got into the car,</i>

1015
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:02,978
<i>and when we looked back,</i>
<i>there were people all over the train.</i>

1016
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:06,278
<i>They always acted quickly.</i>

1017
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:09,513
<i>People werent that proud back then.</i>

1018
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:13,558
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>- It's probably</i>- 

1019
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:16,559
<i>And he just keeps running.</i>

1020
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:21,798
<i>He cut himself here.</i>
<i>And Bahs was furious</i>

1021
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:26,299
<i>because they'd put real glass</i>
<i>in all the window frames.</i>

1022
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:34,170
<i>Instead of artificial glass.</i>
<i>So he cut himself on the door.</i>

1023
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:38,751
<i>Then Bahs said,</i>
<i>"A-a-a-re you in-in-insane?"</i>

1024
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:43,521
<i>I remember that one.</i>

1025
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:48,119
<i>The Polish assistant directors</i>
<i>kept yelling,</i> "Uwaga! Uwaga!"

1026
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,355
<i>"Careful! Careful!"</i>

1027
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:59,098
<i>Tómas was sick when we did</i>
<i>the shot of the Berlina in the woods.</i>

1028
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,571
<i>Then I got sick.</i>

1029
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:06,440
<i>I was sitting in the woods,</i>
<i>taking a crap on a slope.</i>

1030
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:11,142
<i>Then I fell backwards down</i>
<i>the slope and rolled around</i> - 

1031
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:14,446
<i>- In the crap.</i>
<i>- I'm not sure.</i>

1032
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:19,525
<i>The area was so contaminated</i>
<i>that you couldn't really tell,</i>

1033
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,687
<i>but I just remember sitting there</i>
<i>and then everything went black.</i>

1034
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:27,757
<i>It wasnt always easy.</i>

1035
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:37,168
<i>You shouldn't take a crap down a slope.</i>
<i>Do it up the slope instead.</i>

1036
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:43,844
<i>As far as I remember, it was always</i>
<i>20 below while we were there.</i>

1037
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:48,921
<i>Well, the crap won't have time</i>
<i>to freeze before you fall into it.</i>

1038
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:56,028
<i>I think it's because,</i>
<i>right after you've relieved yourself,</i>

1039
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,721
<i>your knees start to relax.</i>

1040
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,833
<i>That's when you need</i>
<i>to pay extra attention.</i>

1041
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:09,535
<i>But apparently it's quite common</i>
<i>in Poland, because nobody</i>- 

1042
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:11,545
<i>What the hell.</i>

1043
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:17,707
<i>Did I tell you about the time I had</i>
<i>to empty the toilet in the camper?</i>

1044
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:23,289
<i>In Western Europe there are special</i>
<i>places where you can empty</i>- 

1045
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:27,860
<i>In Germany, you were actually</i>
<i>shown the way to these places.</i>

1046
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:32,362
<i>I asked one of the assistants</i>
<i>to help me.</i>

1047
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:37,470
<i>He looked at the toilet and said:</i>

1048
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:41,369
<i>"What do you want me to do?"</i>
<i>"I want you to empty it."</i>

1049
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:44,204
<i>Then he just emptied it</i>
<i>next to the car.</i>

1050
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:47,476
<i>"Is there anything else I can do?"</i>
<i>"No."</i>

1051
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:50,881
<i>There werent that many</i>
<i>environmental regulations back then.</i>

1052
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:57,052
<i>Look, that's difficult.</i>
<i>Difficult, difficult, difficult.</i>

1053
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:01,991
<i>And now the camera turns.</i>
<i>It's extremely difficult.</i>

1054
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:05,063
<i>He's nauseous</i>
<i>and therefore the room spins.</i>

1055
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,573
Your uncle kindly got a card for you.

1056
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:18,944
We now want you to make bed 42.

1057
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:21,014
<i>Now he just needs to make the bed.</i>

1058
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:23,850
<i>And the clock's ticking.</i>

1059
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:29,987
<i>It's actually a fun film,</i>
<i>though most people would deny it.</i>

1060
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:41,258
<i>Those two men</i>
<i>are so self-righteous.</i>

1061
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:43,737
<i>Yes. But what the hell.</i>

1062
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:47,199
<i>Well, an examination requires</i>
<i>a certain amount of respect.</i>

1063
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:52,880
<i>But you don't really want</i>
<i>those three as your examiners, right?</i>

1064
01:30:56,484 --> 01:31:02,047
<i>And he's also busy looking at</i>
<i>the back projections through the window.</i>

1065
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,258
<i>But they won't accept</i>
<i>that kind of behavior.</i>

1066
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:09,359
<i>Bahs wanted the curtains to be down.</i>

1067
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:14,263
<i>Then we didn't have to concentrate</i>
<i>on those surroundings too.</i>

1068
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:18,838
<i>The old hand really took you</i>
<i>by surprise there.</i>

1069
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,066
<i>Yes, he knew that it was important</i>
<i>to keep the curtains down.</i>

1070
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:28,208
<i>In that sense,</i>
<i>it's really a Bahs film.</i>

1071
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:34,844
<i>- We made it for his sake.</i>
<i>- But he also did a great job.</i>

1072
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:39,015
<i>And if he hadnt recommended</i>
<i>the film at the meeting,</i>

1073
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:41,195
<i>it would have been dropped.</i>

1074
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:45,631
<i>Despite the fact that</i>
<i>Georg Metz wanted to make</i> Sofie.

1075
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:51,032
<i>Which Liv Ullmann directed.</i>

1076
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:56,940
<i>The Lord works in mysterious ways.</i>

1077
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:06,784
<i>- "Sleep well."</i>
<i>- "With compliments."</i>

1078
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:09,183
- <i>"From Zentropa."</i>
- <i>No kidding.</i>

1079
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:12,918
<i>- We could use that now.</i>
<i>- We could use the blankets.</i>

1080
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:16,096
<i>But they're probably at Nordisk Film.</i>

1081
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:20,798
<i>They've been used in</i>
<i>several films since then.</i>

1082
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:27,399
<i>Now he climbs a small ladder.</i>
<i>- He's testing the bed.</i>

1083
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,012
<i>He's just testing</i> - 

1084
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:37,849
<i>You find the film amusing.</i>
<i>Havert you seen it before?</i>

1085
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:41,852
<i>Not while I've been awake.</i>
<i>It's quite funny.</i>

1086
01:32:46,794 --> 01:32:48,159
<i>Oh, my.</i>

1087
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:55,268
<i>At the premiere I slept with my head</i>
<i>on Bo Christensers shoulder.</i>

1088
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:59,235
<i>He was also managing director</i>
<i>at Nordisk Film. A nice old man.</i>

1089
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:07,440
<i>There she is.</i>
<i>She is not that passionate here.</i>

1090
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,208
<i>Whoops.</i>

1091
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,854
<i>She's tied to the chair.</i>

1092
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:22,554
<i>You couldn't say the same thing</i>
<i>about the audience in Cannes.</i>

1093
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,527
<i>Those who stayed</i>

1094
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:30,602
<i>did so because they wanted to</i>
<i>criticize it from beginning to end.</i>

1095
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:38,509
<i>The train company is called Zentropa.</i>

1096
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,275
- <i>It reminds me of something.</i>
- <i>It reminds me of something, yes.</i>

1097
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:46,718
<i>Niels and I were worried</i>
<i>about Mitropa</i> - 

1098
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:49,651
<i>That they would sue us.</i>

1099
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:54,421
<i>And then Niels came up</i>
<i>with Zentropa.</i>

1100
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:59,089
<i>So he came up with the name?</i>
<i>Then we probably owe him something.</i>

1101
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,995
<i>But he's never made any demands.</i>

1102
01:34:02,203 --> 01:34:06,765
<i>Here's one of the color shots</i>
<i>which ensures the term "color film."</i>

1103
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:13,072
<i>Yes, and I think it was</i> - 
<i>It was a wipe.</i>

1104
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:18,081
<i>It had to be in color,</i>
<i>because it was very emotional.</i>

1105
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:20,378
<i>Did we follow certain rules</i>
<i>concerning when</i> - 

1106
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:29,194
<i>It depended on the importance.</i>
<i>The emergency brake is in color.</i>

1107
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:34,130
<i>- What's important in this scene?</i>
<i>- Their love. Those two together.</i>

1108
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,769
<i>Seriously,</i>
<i>how can she love Jean-Marc?</i>

1109
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:40,031
<i>Well, we did pay her to love him.</i>

1110
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:45,610
<i>The nice kid</i>
<i>with the handkerchief on his head.</i>

1111
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:52,343
<i>Did I tell you that it was</i>
<i>a reminiscence of my Jewish past?</i>

1112
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:55,980
<i>Right.</i>
<i>You used it instead of the skullcap.</i>

1113
01:34:57,925 --> 01:35:03,591
<i>Now we're repeating things for those</i>
<i>who have just started watching this.</i>

1114
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:09,133
<i>Maybe the viewers haven't listened</i>
<i>to everything we've said.</i>

1115
01:35:09,336 --> 01:35:12,635
<i>Let's hope so.</i>

1116
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:20,337
<i>The company name is the same as</i>
<i>our company's name. Why is that?</i>

1117
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:26,410
<i>I believe it was because we</i>
<i>couldn't come up with a better name.</i>

1118
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:31,353
<i>We had to put a name</i>
<i>on the registration form</i>

1119
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:36,887
<i>to the Danish Commerce</i>
<i>and Companies Agency.</i>

1120
01:35:36,997 --> 01:35:40,160
<i>And we wrote "Zentropa."</i>

1121
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:44,269
<i>I thought it should sound</i>
<i>more industrialized,</i>

1122
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:47,339
<i>so we added "entertainments."</i>

1123
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:50,977
<i>Not that our films have ever</i>
<i>entertained anyone.</i>

1124
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,045
<i>Why did we write it in plural?</i>

1125
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:58,207
<i>Because it was different kinds</i>
<i>of entertainments.</i>

1126
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:04,619
<i>But several teachers of English</i>
<i>have told us that it's incorrect.</i>

1127
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:11,289
<i>There you can see</i>
<i>how difficult it was to focus.</i>

1128
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:15,731
<i>Yes, especially when</i>
<i>it moved back and forth.</i>

1129
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:21,533
<i>Niels and I had a company</i>
<i>called "Element Film."</i>

1130
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:26,543
<i>It was inspired by Bergman who had</i>
<i>a company called "Persona Film."</i>

1131
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:32,743
<i>After he made</i> Persona,
<i>he used the name as a company name.</i>

1132
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:39,826
<i>Therefore,</i>
<i>we decided to call it Zentropa.</i>

1133
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:44,521
<i>And in many ways,</i>
<i>Denmark lies in the center of Europe.</i>

1134
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:49,032
<i>So it isn't inspired</i>
<i>by something Buddhist?</i>

1135
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:54,868
<i>No, but we would have liked</i>
<i>to have a network called "Zen."</i>

1136
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:58,169
<i>"Zentropa Entertainments Network."</i>

1137
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,780
<i>We did</i> - 
<i>- We've had many dreams.</i>

1138
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:03,349
<i>We did.</i>

1139
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:06,044
<i>Fortunately,</i>
<i>most of them were shattered.</i>

1140
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:11,350
<i>There's the logo.</i>
<i>We should have kept the eagle.</i>

1141
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:15,187
<i>Yes, the logo could have</i> - 

1142
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:18,730
<i>That's Hardy Rafn.</i>
- "Schuhe putzen."

1143
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,134
"Schuhe putzen."

1144
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:23,761
<i>He had a bad temper too.</i>

1145
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:31,409
<i>That was after Hummer Højmark</i>
<i>hit his forehead with a piece of glass.</i>

1146
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:36,481
<i>Yes, it's always dangerous</i>
<i>to be around the special effects guys.</i>

1147
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:41,310
<i>He also knew his lines.</i>

1148
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:42,889
<i>That he did.</i>

1149
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:49,485
<i>And Benny</i>- 
<i>The old man is still asleep.</i>

1150
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:53,098
<i>That was yet</i>
<i>another funny element.</i>

1151
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,825
<i>In addition, of course,</i>
<i>to Ernst-Hugo, who was brilliant.</i>

1152
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:03,734
<i>Now he's asked different things.</i>
<i>Oh, the examination is over.</i>

1153
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:10,614
<i>Now he tells him</i>
<i>that he probably won't pass.</i>

1154
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:13,286
<i>Actually, it was a script</i>
<i>filled with humor.</i>

1155
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:19,155
<i>You and Niels giggled a lot</i>
<i>while you wrote it.</i>

1156
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:24,161
<i>That was the history with</i> - 

1157
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,827
<i>What's with the movement</i>
<i>of the nose?</i>

1158
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:32,665
<i>I got it from our chiropractor.</i>

1159
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:37,333
<i>Right, the one from Rødovre.</i>
<i>He had a "death machine."</i>

1160
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:42,140
<i>It could break your neck.</i>
<i>Right before he turned your head</i> - 

1161
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:46,109
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>- He used to</i> - 

1162
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:53,157
<i>He wrinkled</i>
<i>the bridge of his nose.</i>

1163
01:38:55,329 --> 01:39:00,665
<i>But this film was, as mentioned</i>
<i>earlier, produced by Nordisk Film.</i>

1164
01:39:00,868 --> 01:39:03,735
<i>Yes, and they've just</i>
<i>sent us a reminder.</i>

1165
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:07,806
<i>They've bought</i>
<i>the copyrights to the film,</i>

1166
01:39:08,008 --> 01:39:10,704
<i>but now they claim</i>
<i>we owe them money.</i>

1167
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:15,143
<i>So maybe we are marketing</i>
<i>their product right now.</i>

1168
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:20,242
<i>It's a mistake, of course.</i>

1169
01:39:21,221 --> 01:39:23,189
<i>They haven't done much</i>
<i>to market it themselves.</i>

1170
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:32,331
<i>Didnt Harvey Weinstein drop it too?</i>

1171
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:36,526
<i>Yes, his company,</i>
<i>Dimension, bought it.</i>

1172
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:41,070
<i>I think he bought it</i>
<i>just to keep it on the shelf.</i>

1173
01:39:42,443 --> 01:39:44,411
<i>To prevent things</i>
<i>from being shown.</i>

1174
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:50,383
<i>He paid 150,000 dollars for it.</i>
<i>That was a lot of money back then.</i>

1175
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:54,747
<i>Especially if he just wanted</i>
<i>to keep it on the shelf.</i>

1176
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:58,186
<i>In America,</i>
<i>the film was called</i> Zentropa <i>too.</i>

1177
01:39:58,392 --> 01:40:02,260
<i>Because there was another European</i>
<i>film called</i> Europa, Europa.

1178
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:04,431
<i>Then it couldn't be called</i> Europa.

1179
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,695
<i>Then it should have been called</i>
Europa, Europa, Europa.

1180
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:17,434
<i>Now Jean-Marc gets angry.</i>
<i>- Finally.</i>

1181
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,871
<i>It's always fun</i>
<i>to make something with guns.</i>

1182
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:23,549
<i>Now everybody's quiet.</i>

1183
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:28,447
<i>He's no longer angry</i>
<i>about the shoes.</i>

1184
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:34,855
<i>After our argument the other day,</i>
<i>everybody was quiet afterwards too.</i>

1185
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:44,136
<i>They were really angry with him.</i>

1186
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:47,707
<i>And he takes a little nap.</i>

1187
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:53,571
<i>Despite the fact</i>
<i>that he just fired his weapon.</i>

1188
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:02,678
<i>And the snow is falling outside.</i>
<i>It's really pretty.</i>

1189
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:09,022
<i>I've been told that American</i>
<i>directors were inspired by this film.</i>

1190
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:11,030
<i>Who?</i>

1191
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,098
<i>Spielberg and</i> - 
<i>Maybe it's just a tall tale.</i>

1192
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:19,195
<i>To hell with that.</i>
<i>Tales are</i> - 

1193
01:41:19,306 --> 01:41:22,935
<i>When he made the film</i>
<i>about the concentration camps.</i>

1194
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,610
Schindler's List.

1195
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:30,139
<i>It's probably a tall tale.</i>
<i>But what the hell?</i>

1196
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:34,844
<i>It's a good story.</i>
<i>- Tall tales are great stories.</i>

1197
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:42,384
<i>We did our best. And that has</i>
<i>been patinated by a happy painter.</i>

1198
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:45,394
<i>Here we pass by some uprights.</i>

1199
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:48,363
<i>And we probably</i>
<i>spent two weeks on each.</i>

1200
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:55,508
<i>- Here we go.</i>
<i>- The Märklin train.</i>

1201
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:58,940
<i>Or is it a real train?</i>
<i>- It was on a bigger scale.</i>

1202
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:00,604
<i>Yes, it was big.</i>

1203
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:03,910
<i>Goddamn it!</i>
<i>The wheel.</i>

1204
01:42:05,085 --> 01:42:08,145
<i>One of the cameramen</i>
<i>was almost killed here.</i>

1205
01:42:09,356 --> 01:42:11,324
<i>It fell off its hinges.</i>

1206
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:16,757
<i>The entire compartment hung</i>
<i>on a wheel which fell down.</i>

1207
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:20,764
<i>It was fastened with a split pin</i>
<i>which was about half an inch long.</i>

1208
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:22,596
<i>That was pretty drastic.</i>

1209
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:29,534
<i>- Jean-Marc was great with water.</i>
<i>- He'd just made a film in water.</i>

1210
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:31,176
<i>He was excellent</i>

1211
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:36,941
<i>when it came to holding</i>
<i>his breath underwater.</i>

1212
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:41,952
<i>And he knew</i>
<i>how to take a breath</i>

1213
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:47,856
<i>so you could see the bubbles</i>
<i>underwater.</i>

1214
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:51,462
<i>- That shot is flawed.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1215
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:54,429
<i>Shit. And you could actually tell.</i>

1216
01:42:54,635 --> 01:43:00,972
<i>That bothers me. It wasnt</i>
<i>an attempt to lengthen the shot.</i>

1217
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:08,448
<i>There's Max again.</i>

1218
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,618
<i>There's a rat in the cage.</i>

1219
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:16,552
<i>This was shot at</i>

1220
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:20,625
<i>"Dansk Hydraulisk Institut"</i>
<i>in Hørsholm.</i>

1221
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:26,231
<i>You paddled around with snorkels</i> - 
<i>No, with oxygen tanks.</i>

1222
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:30,494
<i>Yes, that was a lot of fun.</i>

1223
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:34,640
<i>We got all the underwater things</i>
<i>from an English company,</i>

1224
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:39,904
<i>and there's an end scene</i>
<i>which I just couldn't get right.</i>

1225
01:43:40,113 --> 01:43:42,513
<i>But they were sure that they could.</i>

1226
01:43:43,283 --> 01:43:50,485
<i>There was a scene where</i>
<i>he was to stand on a sandbank.</i>

1227
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:54,525
<i>The entire studio</i>
<i>was filled with sand</i>

1228
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:58,528
<i>and you could see this Ken doll</i>
<i>hanging in the distance.</i>

1229
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:00,757
<i>It looked like shit.</i>

1230
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:05,928
<i>We spent a lot of money on that.</i>
<i>Look! He takes a breath.</i>

1231
01:44:06,139 --> 01:44:10,872
<i>You need to be really determined</i>
<i>to do such a thing.</i>

1232
01:44:16,817 --> 01:44:19,411
<i>He's really acting here.</i>

1233
01:44:19,519 --> 01:44:23,888
<i>Yes, because he tries to make</i>
<i>the character seem very intelligent.</i>

1234
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:28,150
<i>Look!</i>
<i>- That hurts.</i>

1235
01:44:38,872 --> 01:44:43,400
<i>Do you remember what people</i>
<i>said in Cannes afterwards?</i>

1236
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,841
<i>No. Was I in Cannes too?</i>

1237
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:49,641
<i>Yes, you were there.</i>

1238
01:44:54,254 --> 01:44:59,317
<i>I think you took the train.</i>
<i>- How wise of me.</i>

1239
01:45:00,027 --> 01:45:04,726
<i>- You crossed bridges.</i>
<i>- It's really great.</i>

1240
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:06,822
<i>It really is. Yes.</i>

1241
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:19,204
<i>- Look at that!</i>
<i>- Yes, tell us about that.</i>

1242
01:45:19,413 --> 01:45:24,874
<i>There were a lot of faces,</i>
<i>but the superimposition isn't too good.</i>

1243
01:45:25,085 --> 01:45:27,883
<i>It's a back projection underwater.</i>

1244
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:31,717
<i>Yes, and the screen</i>
<i>was floating on top of the water.</i>

1245
01:45:31,925 --> 01:45:35,588
<i>Then there was a projector</i>
<i>up in the air</i>

1246
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,458
<i>and the images</i>
<i>were shown on the screen.</i>

1247
01:45:40,934 --> 01:45:42,458
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1248
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:48,073
<i>And it's inspired, especially</i>
<i>the thing with the aquatic plants,</i>

1249
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:50,209
<i>by</i> The Night of the Hunter.

1250
01:45:51,978 --> 01:45:56,642
<i>- We saw it on VHS.</i>
<i>- It was a great film.</i>

1251
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,818
<i>It was the only film</i>
<i>he ever directed.</i>

1252
01:46:01,254 --> 01:46:04,781
<i>Who was it?</i>
<i>Was it Charles Laughton?</i>

1253
01:46:06,626 --> 01:46:12,758
<i>Yes, wasnt it? Yes, he was in</i>
The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

1254
01:46:15,836 --> 01:46:17,895
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>It's truly beautiful.</i>

1255
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:21,407
<i>Then he drifted out to sea.</i>

1256
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:25,510
<i>- And then</i> - 
<i>- Nordisk had had it with us.</i>

1257
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:27,612
<i>We'd surpassed the budget</i>
<i>by two million.</i>

1258
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:34,244
<i>In</i> Element of Crime,
<i>the end scene didn't succeed either.</i>

1259
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:36,422
<i>No, it was the opening scene.</i>

1260
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:40,324
<i>You've got a thing</i>
<i>for those underwater scenes.</i>

1261
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:45,464
<i>Compared to today's standards,</i>
<i>that's a lousy shot.</i>

1262
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:48,429
<i>That almost makes it even</i>
<i>more beautiful.</i>

1263
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:50,660
<i>It almost becomes a bit naive.</i>

1264
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:56,836
<i>It's a superimposition.</i>

1265
01:46:57,043 --> 01:47:03,209
<i>It's not a matte painting.</i>
<i>It's a superimposition of</i>- 

1266
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:09,522
<i>of something</i>
<i>which had been drawn.</i>

1267
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:12,782
<i>He was called Finn,</i>
<i>the guy who drew it.</i>

1268
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:18,459
<i>Look at that!</i>
<i>And in the end we have a great song.</i>

1269
01:47:19,299 --> 01:47:23,497
<i>In the beginning, we wanted</i>
<i>Sinéad O'Connor to sing it.</i>

1270
01:47:23,703 --> 01:47:30,233
<i>Because Lars Kolvig had heard</i>
<i>her sing "Nothing Comes to You."</i>

1271
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:33,208
<i>"Nothing Compares to You."</i>
<i>Did he like it?</i>

1272
01:47:33,413 --> 01:47:36,507
<i>Yes, but she didn't want to sing it.</i>

1273
01:47:37,217 --> 01:47:41,210
<i>So we had the German punk</i> - 
<i>- Nina Hagen.</i>

1274
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:47,758
<i>We didn't have anything</i>
<i>to do with that.</i>

1275
01:47:47,961 --> 01:47:53,900
<i>It was Joachim Holbek.</i>
<i>- Your brother-in-law.</i>

1276
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:58,059
<i>I spoke to Mørk's son the other day.</i>
<i>Christian.</i>

1277
01:47:59,773 --> 01:48:03,004
<i>- He's an American now.</i>
<i>- He lives in New York.</i>

1278
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:09,237
<i>Max von Sydow should have played</i>
<i>Uncle Kessler.</i>

1279
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:11,417
<i>You wanted him to play</i>
<i>the character.</i>

1280
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:17,222
<i>But we avoided that</i>
<i>by offering him a low salary.</i>

1281
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:19,790
<i>Then Ernst-Hugo got the part instead.</i>

1282
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:26,125
<i>János Herskó. That was the man</i>
<i>from the film school in Stockholm.</i>

1283
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:28,801
<i>They're all dead.</i>

1284
01:48:34,774 --> 01:48:37,800
<i>Yes, the eternal Jew.</i>

1285
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:42,539
<i>Bo Christensen. He played the villain</i>
<i>in several Olsen Gang films.</i>

1286
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:47,482
<i>He always wore</i>
<i>a white jacket and a hat.</i>

1287
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:55,826
<i>Why</i>- 
<i>Why isn't he credited as "operator"?</i>

1288
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:58,190
<i>In order to get</i>
<i>the money from France</i>

1289
01:48:58,298 --> 01:49:03,258
<i>Jean-Paul was listed</i>
<i>as a director of photography.</i>

1290
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:08,772
<i>When they were upgraded</i>
<i>in the credits we got more money.</i>

1291
01:49:09,476 --> 01:49:13,936
<i>Henning Bendtsen has made</i>
<i>a beautiful black-and-white film.</i>

1292
01:49:14,147 --> 01:49:19,915
<i>His blood pressure suffered from it,</i>
<i>but he said it was my fault.</i>

1293
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:24,022
<i>- He was probably right.</i>
<i>- Probably.</i>

1294
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:27,682
<i>Philippe Bober.</i>
<i>- And Erik Crone.</i>

1295
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:32,354
<i>Do you remember Philippe Guez?</i>
<i>The chubby French guy?</i>

1296
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:34,534
<i>Yes.</i>

1297
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:37,359
<i>Mital's right hand.</i>

1298
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:40,165
<i>Who was the "Remember me" guy?</i>

1299
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:47,842
<i>It was a producer I talked to</i> - 
<i>- He scared me to death.</i>

1300
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:54,018
<i>Let's not bad-mouth him.</i>
<i>Maybe he sees this.</i>

1301
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:57,348
<i>- He was a French</i> - 
<i>- I won't say his name here.</i>

1302
01:49:57,457 --> 01:50:02,053
<i>I just remember</i>
<i>he came up to me in Cannes:</i>

1303
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:06,961
<i>"Remember me?"</i>
<i>- He almost had his Magnum ready.</i>

1304
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:09,658
<i>He didn't need it.</i>
<i>He was so scary all by himself.</i>

1305
01:50:11,871 --> 01:50:16,001
<i>He's asked me to work with him since,</i>
<i>but I'm too scared to do it.</i>

1306
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:23,474
<i>- Those French guys.</i>
<i>- They've got that Latin temper.</i>

1307
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:27,651
<i>Can you read that?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

1308
01:50:27,754 --> 01:50:32,316
<i>Not even if I raise my head</i> - 

1309
01:50:38,765 --> 01:50:42,565
<i>I think the expenses ended</i>
<i>at about 27 million kroner.</i>

1310
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:48,867
<i>That was a lot of money back then.</i>
<i>- How did we get all that money?</i>

1311
01:50:49,075 --> 01:50:53,944
<i>It was Sweden,</i>
<i>Germany and France</i> - 

1312
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:56,115
<i>They've all gone bankrupt.</i>
<i>All our partners.</i>

1313
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:03,055
<i>We tried to find</i>
<i>the German company recently.</i>

1314
01:51:03,256 --> 01:51:07,283
<i>- But it doesn't exist anymore.</i>
<i>- We've caused a lot of trouble.</i>

1315
01:51:09,929 --> 01:51:12,056
<i>And Nordisk Film was sold</i>
<i>to Egmont afterwards.</i>

1316
01:51:14,267 --> 01:51:15,598
<i>It was?</i>

1317
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:22,797
<i>Panavision.</i>
<i>- Yes, it was important.</i>

1318
01:51:23,009 --> 01:51:26,740
<i>That it was Panavision. Back then,</i>
<i>some things were very important.</i>

1319
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:31,314
<i>Things that didn't have</i>
<i>anything to do with profit.</i>

1320
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,987
<i>"Mega."</i>

1321
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:41,218
<i>Yes, Kjeld Wennick</i>
<i>did the soundtrack.</i>

1322
01:51:41,761 --> 01:51:47,563
<i>It hasn't been a hit on the charts.</i>

1323
01:51:47,767 --> 01:51:54,070
<i>But we'd hoped that it would be</i>
<i>a hit on the request programs.</i>

1324
01:51:54,874 --> 01:51:56,842
<i>"We would like to hear</i> Europa. <i>"</i>

1325
01:51:57,043 --> 01:52:00,774
<i>"We've collected some money</i>
<i>in a conductor's hat. "</i>

1326
01:52:03,283 --> 01:52:07,743
<i>Well, that was great.</i>
<i>I haven't seen it since, have you?</i>

1327
01:52:07,954 --> 01:52:14,917
<i>No. It wasnt too bad.</i>
<i>But I'm really tired now.</i>
