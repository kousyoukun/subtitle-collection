1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,035
Father Tomasino

2
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:40,737
Is the Chief gonna see us or not?
Not right now

3
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:45,640
He'll give you a break, he always does.
Sit down.

4
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:51,850
Did you call in to report
that you were going off duty?

5
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:55,341
I was upstairs when I heard Lt. Kilrain
is in with the Chief. I gotta talk to him.

6
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:57,113
Look, I know how you feel, kid.

7
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:59,374
And maybe you got a little more reason.

8
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:02,941
But there's not a man in this Department
that don't want to help bring in the priest's killer.

9
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,903
You're not ready for this sort of thing.

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,798
If you think I'm gonna ride around on a bike...

11
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,105
What have you got for us, Kilrain?

12
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:11,951
Summer will brief you upstairs.

13
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,059
We'll talk about it upstairs.

14
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,847
Lt. Kilrain?

15
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:23,821
Yeah?

16
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,345
I'm Joe Martini.

17
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,888
So?

18
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,813
I wanted to talk to you about Father Tomasino.

19
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:35,417
You got something for me?

20
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:38,487
No, sir.
I just wanted to know what happened.

21
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:40,226
He was a close friend of the priest's.

22
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,337
The Father got him his job here.

23
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,779
There's not much to tell, son.

24
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,134
Someone phoned him at the parish house last night

25
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,475
and said they had to see Father Tomasino right away.

26
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:53,053
He went.

27
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,712
Whoever it was called him wouldn't let him go back.

28
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:58,876
Have you got any leads working for you?

29
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:00,619
Would I be standing here?

30
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:03,187
No. So far we got big fat nothings.

31
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,011
I wanna help.

32
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:09,974
It's Homicide's baby, now.
Nothing you can do that we're not doing.

33
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:12,001
You can use me. Transfer me to Homicide.

34
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:16,564
Look, Martini. My desk is loaded with telegrams.
The switchboard's jammed with calls.

35
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:19,826
Everybody in North Beach wants to help to find the guy
who killed the priest.

36
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:21,609
He was more than just a priest to me.

37
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:24,194
That's why you'd be in the way.

38
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:26,207
Send him back to traffic where he belongs.

39
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:27,359
Joe.

40
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,735
Why don't you take a couple of days off?

41
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,552
I'll square it with your captain.

42
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:55,461
Hey, Joe, you oughta see
that inside curve you showed me.

43
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:56,708
Why don't you come down and take a look?

44
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,634
Did you get off duty to watch us practice, Joe?

45
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:01,026
What about father Tomasino?
Is he coming too?

46
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,164
Not today, boys.

47
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,872
Hey, Joe. You wanna play baseball?

48
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:07,843
Boys, boys!
Listen to the sister.

49
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,772
Back to the field.
All of you play ball.

50
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:10,996
See you later.

51
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:13,875
Hello, Joe. Go on, now.
See you later, Joe. Bye.

52
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,789
Mother?

53
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,981
I haven't told them, Joe.

54
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:23,183
How do I tell them?

55
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,448
Why?

56
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,442
Why did it happen?

57
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,373
How could God let a thing like this happen?

58
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:33,271
Death is in the pattern of life, Joe.
As is birth, which no one questions.

59
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:35,406
I'm questioning it, Mother Catherine. Why?

60
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,756
I know how much Father Tomasino meant to you...
No you don't. You couldn't.

61
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:44,558
Ever since I can remember he's been...
I was here when he brought you.

62
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,453
You were six years old.

63
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:49,570
A frightened little boy who had just lost his parents
and was all alone.

64
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,935
Except for him.

65
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:52,429
He was my family.

66
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:57,770
If he would have died in his sleep or been hit by a car
it would be hard enough.

67
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:00,783
But to be stabbed in the back in an alley.

68
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:03,611
I don't understand Mother Catherine.

69
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:05,713
I'm struggling with it too.

70
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,326
Come, let us pray for Father Tomasino.

71
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,816
The way he lived his life
he doesn't need my prayers.

72
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,818
Then pray for the one who took his life.

73
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:16,524
Joe, don't leave this place
with hate in your soul.

74
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,946
Goodbye, Mother.

75
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:40,238
Father, we've tried to keep out
of your hair up till now.

76
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:41,617
And we've appreciated it.

77
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,845
But we're up against a blank wall.

78
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,242
Until we come up with a motive
there's nothing much we can do.

79
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:53,376
Now, you were Father Tomasino's closest friend,
his assistant pastor.

80
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:56,081
There must have been somebody in the parish
who hated him.

81
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,294
I don't know how you can say that.
Everybody loved him.

82
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,475
Let's skip the emotion this time, Father.

83
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,728
Whether you like it or not...

84
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,924
Father Tomasino did have an enemy.

85
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,379
I refuse to believe that.

86
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,217
Then who killed him? A friend?

87
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:14,710
Yes, Gillen?

88
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,100
It's the Martini kid.

89
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:19,273
I sent out word I haven't got time.
I can't see him now.

90
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,902
That's why he asked me to bring him up.

91
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,438
Hello, Father.
Hello, Joe.

92
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,670
Shut the door.

93
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,403
Alright, son. What is it?

94
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,276
The other day when I wanted a transfer to Homicide
you asked me if I had anything.

95
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,611
Well, I think I've come across something.

96
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,745
What is it?

97
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,201
It's a man. Nothing definite.
You might even call it a hunch.

98
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:43,441
But at least it's something to start with.

99
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,727
I've done some checking around already.

100
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:47,079
Get to the point.

101
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:49,204
I saw him at the funeral.

102
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,948
He was going through hell.

103
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:54,492
He used to be a member of the parish.
His name is Sylvio Malatesta.

104
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,824
Do you know him, Father?

105
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,847
Of course.
Everybody in North Beach knows him.

106
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:01,202
And likes him.
Joe, you've made a terrible mistake.

107
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,384
Sylvio had a reverence for Father Tomasino.

108
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:05,689
It was almost a childlike adoration.

109
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:08,155
I'm telling you.
He was going through the tortures of the damned.

110
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,573
He was bleeding inside.
He was tearing his hands.

111
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,855
Dozens of people are breaking up
over Father Tomasino.

112
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:17,595
We can't go around arresting people
just because of the expressions on their faces.

113
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:20,551
It was more than just the expression.
Alright, it was suffering.

114
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,560
What would he have said if he'd seen your face?

115
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,848
Well, I think it's worth checking.

116
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,189
We'll check hunches later.
Right now we're after facts.

117
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,481
Facts? The facts are you got nothing
and you're getting no place.

118
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,740
Get him out of here Gillen. If I see him around here again
I'll have his job.

119
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:39,609
Now, Father, let's go over this again.

120
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,863
Give it up, will you, Joe?

121
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:45,718
You've been on a run since it happened.

122
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,837
I covered you with your captain.

123
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:50,777
But the funeral is over.
I'm fresh out of excuses.

124
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,879
You won't need them any more.

125
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:55,853
What are you doing?
I just can't sit around doing nothing.

126
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,489
Joe, you know what you're doing?
Reinstatement ain't easy.

127
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:00,454
I saw Malatesta's face.

128
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:01,638
You didn't.

129
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:30,724
Well, say something.

130
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,062
Nice little crabs.

131
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:34,306
Little crabs?
Ei, Grazzioli...

132
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:38,370
tell him the only time he has ever seen a bigger crab
is when one of mine walks into his store.

133
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:42,719
He says the only time...
I heard him, I heard him.

134
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:45,408
The trouble with you, Antonio,
is you won't take your boat near the rocks.

135
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,709
The ones you catch haven't learned
to crawl yet.

136
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,998
Alright big mouth, I bet I got a bigger crab in my store
than you got right here.

137
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,736
Ten dollars. You take'em?

138
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:58,092
No. I already saw your wife walk in.

139
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,088
Sylvio Malatesta?

140
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,515
Yeah.
I'm Joe Martini.

141
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:27,823
What can I do for you?

142
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,568
You don't know the name?
No, should I?

143
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,812
I guess he didn't get a chance to talk to you about it before.

144
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:39,002
So forget it.

145
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,904
Who didn't have a chance to talk to me?

146
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,065
A friend of mine.

147
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,589
I'm looking for a job.
He said he was going to talk to you.

148
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,130
Maybe you could find something for me.

149
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:49,501
Yeah? Who is it?

150
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:52,088
Father Tomasino.

151
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,018
You knew him, didn't you?

152
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:59,385
Father Tomasino?
Sure.

153
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,737
He was a true saint of a man.

154
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:05,543
His death left a big emptiness inside of us.

155
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,725
Have you done any fishing before?

156
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:11,478
I worked a squid boat out of Monterey.

157
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:12,904
But that was a couple of years ago.

158
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:15,502
I wish I could do something for you.

159
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:19,430
But things are pretty slow right now.
Maybe when the salmon start to run again.

160
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:20,774
Yeah, I know.

161
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:26,857
How much do I owe you?

162
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:29,760
Not a thing. On the house.

163
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:31,754
No, no, I want to pay for the...
Forget it.

164
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,401
Thanks.

165
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:36,596
Say. I'll check with some of the other boys.

166
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:39,297
If there is something,
where can I get in touch with you?

167
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:40,716
I haven't got a place yet.

168
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:44,171
It's the first time I've been in town
that Father Tomasino didn't set things up for me.

169
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,972
You know, it's funny...

170
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,086
not being able to get together with him.

171
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,686
Kinda lonely.

172
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,851
Thanks anyway.

173
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:56,020
Hey!

174
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:00,725
Hey!

175
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:07,402
Why don't you come to my house
for dinner tonight, eh?

176
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:11,148
I couldn't do that, Sylvio.
But thanks...

177
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,328
Aw, come on. Meet the family.

178
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:15,174
Maybe we can talk about a job for you.

179
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,731
I don't want you to go to any trouble.

180
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,924
It's no trouble.
You be here at five.

181
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,962
That's the time I leave.

182
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:25,067
I'll take you home. Give you a nice dinner.

183
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,772
You can use it.
Ok, Sylvio.

184
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,020
Thanks.

185
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:35,203
Let's say I'm doing it for Father Tomasino.

186
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,739
He would want me to do something
for one of his boys.

187
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,774
Ok, Sylvio. I'll see you around five.
Sure.

188
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:53,160
Here, here. Don't you know stealing is a sin?

189
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,765
Don't you know stealing is a sin?

190
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,061
You want anything, you ask for it.

191
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,007
Here...
Wait a minute.

192
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:03,466
For you.

193
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,602
For your brother.

194
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,546
Go on.

195
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,640
There is my house, Joe.

196
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,007
Come on, Joe. I'll show you.

197
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:45,929
You got a free hand.
Give a whistle.

198
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,846
Mamma!
Watch out, Joe. Don't slip on the pasta.

199
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,255
Hey, mamma!

200
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:54,069
I'm home.

201
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,755
Now the whole neighborhood knows.

202
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:57,915
Put more water in the sauce.
I brought somebody for dinner.

203
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:00,376
One more, one less makes no difference.

204
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,004
Hey, mamma.

205
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,508
This is Joe.

206
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:06,127
Joe Martini. One of Father Tomasino's boys.
Hello.

207
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,319
Hello.

208
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,086
You're not the neighborhood boy?

209
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,266
I was up north. I just got into town.

210
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:14,269
Mamma, I got a present for you.

211
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,733
A present?
Yeah, wait till you see it.

212
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,860
A new frame for papa'a picture.

213
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,943
We don't need it.
But he hasn't got a frame.

214
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:29,450
Fix the old one.
I don't want it.

215
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,800
What are you talking about?

216
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:33,021
You don't even know how it's going to look.
Come on.

217
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,916
There's nothing wrong with the old frame.

218
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,823
They can't fix it anymore.
It's been mended too many times.

219
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,618
Come here. Look.
Look at this.

220
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,022
Come on, Joe.
There.

221
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,228
Isn't that nice? Stylish?

222
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:50,710
You spend too much money.
I know what's wrong with you.

223
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:54,860
You think the old one is old-fashioned.
You think everything in the house is old-fashioned.

224
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,990
Next thing I know you'll be taking off papa's moustache.

225
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:00,975
Hey, Joe.
Who's more of a man?

226
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,198
Papa or me?

227
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:07,177
You talk too much.
If you were half the man it would be enough.

228
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,502
I settle for 25%, Mamma.

229
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:12,856
All this fuss and you made me
forget the sauce.

230
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:15,553
Hey, Joe. Come on.
You gotta meet the rest of the family.

231
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:21,667
Hi.

232
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:25,145
My brother, Peanuts.
He thinks slow with a dirty word.

233
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,421
In regard to your letter of June 21st, comma,

234
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:31,217
our shipment of 70 dozen shirts

235
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,849
comma, style C-136,

236
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,412
thru F-420, comma

237
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:40,277
was dispatched on May 9th
according to your shipping instructions, period.

238
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:43,460
We're forwarding your letter to Mr. Smith
for further action, comma...

239
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:47,329
Stop that!
Now you see what you did.

240
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,697
I was up to "Mr. Smith" and now I've lost it.

241
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:52,485
Why do you talk so fast? Why?

242
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,211
Every day you come

243
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,747
My cousin, Anna.
She talks back to records.

244
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,320
Honey, this is Joe Martini.

245
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:06,969
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Martini.

246
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:10,332
Call him Joe. That's his name.
He's going to have dinner with us tonight.

247
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:11,403
That's nice.

248
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,133
Look at these chicken scratchings, Joe.

249
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,178
That's the way she wastes her time.

250
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,549
I ask you which is more waste?

251
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:20,795
Studying to be a secretary from the mail order school
or sitting around the house doing nothing?

252
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:23,765
Did we bring you from Italy to be a secretary?

253
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,130
No.

254
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,826
When her parents died we said
cousin Anna you come over here live with us.

255
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:31,032
We take good care of you.
Find you a nice husband.

256
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,580
Find me a husband.
Like finding bait for your fish.

257
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,653
I don't want a husband.
I want to work.

258
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:38,506
Work? For what?

259
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,636
No women in my family work.

260
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:42,460
They get married.
Hey, Joe.

261
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:46,317
Have you ever seen a prettier girl in San Francisco?

262
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,062
Never.

263
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,146
Now you say something nice about him.

264
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:53,289
Oh, stop it, Sylvio.
At least say that he hasn't got two heads.

265
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,929
Alright, Joe, you haven't got two heads.

266
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,687
Thank you.
I hope not.

267
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,751
There's enough water in the sauce now.

268
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,631
Go call your brother.
OK, mamma, OK.

269
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,305
I hope not...

270
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,690
Pietro!

271
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:13,452
Supper! Right now.
Not next week.

272
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,502
Why do you keep asking me
why I run the mile for, Mamma?

273
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,706
Because it's a mile race, that's why?

274
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,748
And I've got to win for Galileo next week.

275
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,552
Now, if those knuckleheads from college...

276
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:33,526
It's crazy. If you go some place, ok.
But you end up where you start.

277
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:35,544
Next year, Joe,
I'm going off with a two-mile.

278
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,235
The grocery store is a half a block away.
I can't even get him to walk.

279
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,238
Hey, you know something?

280
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:42,982
We broke a record tonight.

281
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:45,682
This is the first time we had
a young fellow to dinner...

282
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,617
that Anna doesn't hurry away from the table.

283
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:51,021
Hey, you're doing alright.
Remember that joker, Tony Malfi?

284
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:54,924
Sure. Hey, Joe.
This Tony Malfi, he got a scholarship to college...

285
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,608
played football for Notre Dame...

286
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,836
but halfway through the soup
Anna got a headache.

287
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:03,863
A real headache from his talk of blocking and tacking
and throwing to kick the football, ah!

288
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,666
How about Harry Boncelli?

289
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,151
His mamma and papa still don't talk to us.

290
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:10,864
She wouldn't even let him in the house.

291
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,236
That's the idiot who follows me in his car
when I walk down the street.

292
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,329
And he blows his horn at me.

293
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:23,149
It's always the same. She will rather stay home
than waste her time with an idiot.

294
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,700
I keep saying to her:

295
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:27,110
How are you going to know an idiot...

296
00:18:27,113 --> 00:18:29,195
if you never give him a chance to prove it?

297
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,783
The minute they open their mouths
they prove it.

298
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,824
I just can't stand stupid talk.

299
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:36,002
Joe hasn't said a word since he sat down.

300
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:38,705
I noticed.

301
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:41,052
Hey, Joe.

302
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:42,913
From her that's a compliment.

303
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,391
Hallelujah. You're in like a burglar.

304
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,990
How'd you like to take her
to the Vallejo Social Club?

305
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,624
A week from Saturday.

306
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:53,857
I'd like to very much.

307
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:55,485
No, thank you. I'd rather not.

308
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:56,628
I really would.

309
00:18:56,646 --> 00:18:58,468
Sorry Peanuts embarrassed you.
No, he didn't embarrass...

310
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,472
Anna!
I hope Sylvio won't.

311
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,834
I don't want to go to the dance.
She doesn't want to go to the dance.

312
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,418
But mamma insists she goes.

313
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,186
And who's stuck? Me. Always stuck.
Oh, Pietro!

314
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:11,068
If only she'd stop acting like a square.

315
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:13,076
Plenty of guys are willing to take her
off my hands.

316
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,343
But no, she won't dance with anyone else.

317
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:19,583
Dance? Since when is dancing
this crazy jumping?

318
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,816
She won't even go to a show
without me taking her.

319
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:25,011
I got my own life, you know.
My own girlfriends.

320
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:27,124
They're just begging me to take them out.

321
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,085
Now you see what you've done?

322
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,830
You are no better.

323
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,005
You take her to that dance
or you'll be running that mile with a broken leg.

324
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,275
Ok, ok.
Alright, alright!

325
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,687
That girl, she's got such a temper.

326
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,852
Who did she get it from?

327
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,059
Well, it was the little things.

328
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,996
Like the time Father Tomasino
gave me a concertina.

329
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:55,954
Mother Catherine said it was against the rules...

330
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:58,406
you know, for one kid to get a present
and the others don't, you understand.

331
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:00,261
Well...

332
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,663
He told her I had a gift for music.
What gift for music?

333
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,835
And he said that if I got the concertina
and played it for the other kids...

334
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:08,476
this way they would get a present too.

335
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:14,719
He was a man loved by everyone.

336
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,724
Not everyone.

337
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:23,103
Someone didn't.

338
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,600
Hey, Sylvio.
Hm?

339
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:30,144
What did Joe hit in the best year?

340
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:34,563
Joe who?
The only one that matters in the whole world! DiMaggio!

341
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,787
Oh, Joe DiMaggio.

342
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:39,968
381, in 1939.

343
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:42,013
Pay up!

344
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:44,127
Hey, Joe DiMaggio.

345
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:50,184
I got it, I got it...

346
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:53,695
What a man, DiMaggio.

347
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:00,554
Who do you think did it?

348
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,393
Huh?

349
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:04,762
Oh, I don't know, Joe.

350
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,363
Could have been anybody.

351
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,638
But why?

352
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:14,165
How can he live with it?

353
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:18,342
What does it do to his insides?
How does he eat, how does he sleep?

354
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:21,070
What kind of a man is he, Sylvio?

355
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:26,668
If the cops knew that, Joe,
they'd be able to catch him.

356
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:29,698
Yeah.

357
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:32,304
I could have been with him that night, you know.

358
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:35,453
Instead I was in Santa Rosa.
I could have been right here.

359
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:37,762
But I didn't want to spend the money for bus fare.

360
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:42,451
Do you ever find yourself thinking
about what you were doing that night?

361
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:44,982
Yeah. I was playing cards.

362
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:48,505
At home?
No, at the Vallejo Club.

363
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:50,793
We got a game there every Friday night.

364
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,747
I just can't get it out of my mind.

365
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:58,522
The way he died.

366
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:00,804
In an alley.

367
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,697
You've got to stop thinking about it.

368
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:05,107
Maybe a job will help you.

369
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:08,784
More than a job,
what you need is a home.

370
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:13,066
Mamma likes you.
Anna likes you.

371
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:15,753
I like you, Joe.

372
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:18,568
We got an extra room. You move in and stay with us.
Oh, no, Sylvio.

373
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:21,012
I can't do that.
You come over. It's settled.

374
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:23,332
Tomorrow you pick me up.
Drop me off at the shop.

375
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,078
Take the car, get your stuff,
and you move in with us.

376
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:29,718
Hm?
Thanks, I'd like that.

377
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:33,470
I'm glad to be able to do it.

378
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,311
For Father Tomasino.

379
00:23:04,197 --> 00:23:05,539
Hey, Joe!

380
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:12,034
Give him!

381
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:16,587
Oh, that's beautiful, Joe.

382
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:20,482
Hey, wait! What's the matter with you guys?
Trying to kill me or something?

383
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,661
Boom! I made it!

384
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:04,309
Sylvio, it's after 3 o'clock.

385
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:07,107
Would you like me to make you
a cup of chocolate?

386
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,729
I'm alright, honey.

387
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:12,261
Why don't you go back to bed?
Sometimes it helps you to sleep.

388
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,845
You're as bad as mamma.
Why don't you leave me alone?

389
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:19,998
I'm up anyway.
It will only take a minute.

390
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:08,596
Oh, I'm sorry.

391
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:10,093
What are you doing up?

392
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:11,562
Can't you sleep either?

393
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:14,127
I heard Sylvio.

394
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:16,723
I don't know how he does it.

395
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:21,602
Works all day long
and walks the floor half the night.

396
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:23,713
I'm making him some chocolate.

397
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:25,631
You want some?
Yes, thanks.

398
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:29,744
How long has he been doing that?

399
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,900
Do you know what's bothering him?

400
00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:34,950
He never talks about it.

401
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:37,257
But mamma and I know.

402
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:43,742
He's never gotten over Angelina Poletti,
a girl he met in Italy during the war.

403
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,982
They were very much in love
They were going to get married.

404
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:51,732
Then something happened and they didn't.

405
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,831
Whatever it was it hurt him very deeply.

406
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:00,819
This walking the floor,
it's been going on that long?

407
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,489
Mamma says
ever since he came home from the war.

408
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,677
I need some more milk, Joe.

409
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:18,691
I live with the man, I work with the man,
he treats me like a brother but I still haven't got a thing.

410
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,410
Kilrain is in the same boat.

411
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:22,312
He's no closer to the answer.

412
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:24,432
I thought I had him nailed though.

413
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:27,318
He doesn't sleep nights,
he walks the floor.

414
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:31,065
Then I find out he's been doing it for years.

415
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:33,934
Was he walking the night the priest was killed?

416
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:38,155
According to the coroner,
Father Tomasino was killed at 11 o'clock.

417
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:41,545
According to Malatesta he was playing cards
at a place called the Vallejo Club.

418
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:43,562
It's a regular game, every Friday night.

419
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,297
That shouldn't be to tough to check.
I haven't had a chance.

420
00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:48,714
Last couple of Friday nights
he's been taking me to the fights.

421
00:26:48,763 --> 00:26:51,640
He says he doesn't want me to blow my money
in a card game.

422
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:54,171
The more you tell me,
the more he sounds like a nice guy.

423
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:56,750
I'll tell you after I check his alibi.

424
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:58,590
You wanna know something?

425
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:01,426
I hope it stands up.

426
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,135
You're getting a little mixed up, aren't you, kid?

427
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:09,040
Maybe, but I never had a home before.

428
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:12,638
Not until now.

429
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,066
Hey, Joe!
Excuse me.

430
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:29,655
Hey, Joe, I should have told you...

431
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,571
No use getting dressed.

432
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:33,499
Anna's not going to the dance with you.

433
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:37,149
Since when?
Since I was a comedian this afternoon.

434
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:38,944
She bought a new dress.

435
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:42,501
I had to open my big mouth and tease her
how excited she was about tonight.

436
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:44,328
Suddenly she made up her mind.

437
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:48,535
She said the only reason you are taking her
is because mamma and me want you to.

438
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:50,748
Oh, Sylvio.

439
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,108
I'll handle it.

440
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,533
Don't try it, Joe.

441
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,001
She'll only get mad at you.

442
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:14,053
That was taken the day Father Tomasino
gave me the concertina.

443
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,383
About the dance, Joe. Forget it.

444
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,744
Pietro will take her.

445
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:20,931
You know, you're a great little fixer.
Thanks a lot.

446
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:29,500
You're breaking my heart, Gillespie.

447
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:31,538
Five girls tonight and only you?

448
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,695
What? They've never been out
on a date before?

449
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:35,927
How old are they?

450
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:38,621
Sixteen?
Oh, I'm dying, I'm dying.

451
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,658
No, I told you I'm hooked with my cousin tonight.

452
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:46,187
Can I help it if she's an albatross
around my neck?

453
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,731
I told you I'm not going to go to the dance with you.
Or anyone else.

454
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:52,801
I heard you!

455
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:56,526
You ought to be ashamed!
You rascal!

456
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:57,980
Talking about like that about your cousin!

457
00:28:58,087 --> 00:28:59,908
Hey, ma, what are you hitting me for?
I didn't do nothing.

458
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:01,434
Talking like that about your cousin!

459
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,057
Shame on you!
Hey, ma, come on.

460
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:04,116
Enough, it's alright.

461
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:06,705
What do you mean it's alright?
Nothing is alright.

462
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:07,844
What's happening?

463
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:09,022
What's going on?

464
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:11,699
I talked to a friend, that's all.
Right away it's for the United Nations.

465
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:12,927
What did he say?

466
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,941
It's alright. It doesn't make any difference
what he said.

467
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm not going to go to the dance, period.

468
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:20,323
I'll stay home and study shorthand.

469
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,485
Will somebody please tell me what's going on?

470
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,323
If I can get a word in here, edgewise...

471
00:29:25,358 --> 00:29:26,702
maybe I could straighten it out.

472
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:28,270
It is straightened out.

473
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:30,404
Anna, Pietro will take you.

474
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:35,379
In a million years. Two million.
I won't even go to the door with him.

475
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:36,543
Oh, you shut up!

476
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:39,379
Anna...

477
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,468
Big deal.
Biggest deal in the world.

478
00:29:43,497 --> 00:29:46,086
Where are you going?
Gonna eat a worm.

479
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:48,685
Pietro! Pietro, you come back here.

480
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:54,679
Joe, you are my friend. Will you please tell me
what's going on in my own house?

481
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,590
Anna.

482
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:09,036
I know how you feel.
It's none of your business.

483
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:10,966
Pleaso go to the dance with me tonight.
No!

484
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,888
But we had a date tonight.

485
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:16,150
At least tell me why you changed your mind.
Why are you sore at me for?

486
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:18,441
Because you are a jellyfish.

487
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,274
You don't want to take me to this dance.
Oh, yes I do...

488
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,060
Mamma pushes you.
Pietro pushes you. Sylvio pushes you.

489
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,226
They push you over a cliff if you don't say yes.

490
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:28,355
Nobody's pushing...
Take your hands off me.

491
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,735
I don't want anyone to have to be nice to me.

492
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,125
Cut it out, ma.
So it's hurting, eh?

493
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:41,365
I'm not asking you for Sylvio,
for Pietro or mamma.

494
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:44,437
I'm asking for myself.
Will you please go to the dance with me?

495
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:45,636
I told you no.

496
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:49,807
Anna, you made a date tonight with me.
Not with one of your idiots.

497
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,361
And you're not going to stand me up.

498
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,846
Now, are you coming out
or am I coming in after you?

499
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:03,630
Anna, a locked door isn't gonna stop me.
I'm not fooling around anymore.

500
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:05,553
Come out here this very minute.

501
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:08,013
You know what's wrong with you?

502
00:31:08,017 --> 00:31:10,040
Everybody babies you in this house.

503
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:12,262
Well I'm not about to.
Now come on out here!

504
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:18,003
Alright, you've had it. Step back, lady,
cause I'm coming through.

505
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,749
Joe. Do you like the new dress I bought?

506
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:28,738
You mean to tell me
you're going to the dance with me?

507
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:30,190
Of course.

508
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:33,374
Then why did you make me go through
this big deal of breaking through the door?

509
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:39,066
I wanted to make sure that you wanted to take me.

510
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:43,030
Now I'm sure.
So please go. Let me finish.

511
00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:48,594
Be downstairs in 10 minutes.

512
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:50,226
I'll be there in five.

513
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,180
Excuse me, mamma.
Joe, you're my boy.

514
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,670
You're my boy.

515
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,724
Here, take the car.
Alright, good.

516
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:04,909
Here's some money...
No, no, no.

517
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:06,419
Anything you want, Joe.

518
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:11,141
Hi. You with anyone?
Mamma mia!

519
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:39,640
Joe. Joe!

520
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,899
No dancing in there.
I know, I was just stalling.

521
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:45,857
It's not that I don't like it.
But I'm just a coward when it comes to doing it.

522
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,775
I'm glad. So am I.

523
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:50,192
Let's grab a couple of chairs while we can.

524
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,243
Shall we?
This I think I can manage.

525
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:30,939
I'd almost forgotten people dance like this.

526
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:35,356
Every time I've been here with Pietro
I've limped home with a broken back.

527
00:33:36,742 --> 00:33:38,516
You dance very well, Joe.

528
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,950
I usually have to apologize to everybody
in the floor.

529
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:44,901
I guess it's you.

530
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,172
Joe, thanks.

531
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:57,509
For what?

532
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:59,685
For making me come with you tonight.

533
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:00,982
It's a pleasure.

534
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,728
Well, they've just lost me again.

535
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:11,632
How about some punch?
You order it. I'll be right back.

536
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:25,916
Has Sylvio Malatesta been around tonight?

537
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,176
Friday's his night.

538
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:30,082
Last couple of Fridays nights
we've been going to fights together.

539
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,548
Keeps beefing about missing his game.
I thought maybe I'd find him here.

540
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:34,044
Are you a friend of Sylvio's?

541
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,821
Yeah.

542
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:39,069
You wouldn't be Charlie Cuneo, would you?

543
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,462
No.

544
00:34:40,684 --> 00:34:42,576
Good thing. If you were
maybe we'd throw you out.

545
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,787
Then I'm glad I'm not Charlie Cuneo.

546
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:47,861
Are you gonna be seeing Sylvio?

547
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,569
Oh, yeah. I see him all the time.

548
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:52,184
Tell him Vince De Paul
wants a chance to get his money back.

549
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,307
Cute fellow, Sylvio.

550
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:57,189
Last time he was here
he won six straight pots.

551
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,242
All of a sudden he looks at his watch...

552
00:34:59,254 --> 00:35:02,899
says it's 9 o'clock and he's gotta meet
Charlie Cuneo to play snooker.

553
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,818
When was that?

554
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:07,910
Two weeks ago last night.

555
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,430
He hasn't been back since.

556
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:11,547
And he's walking around
with a pocketful of my money.

557
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,264
Come on, talk on your own time. Deal!

558
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,012
Most guys have their wives call up
when they're winning.

559
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,925
Sylvio has to invent a friend.

560
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:23,349
You tell him I don't think there is
a Charlie Cuneo.

561
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:27,099
Yeah, I'll tell him.

562
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:38,375
Duty calls, baby. I'm yours.

563
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:39,991
No, thank you.

564
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:43,287
Be grateful,
I'm rescuing you from a lifetime of loneliness.

565
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,031
Get out of my way, please.
Shove off!

566
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:48,565
Still want some punch?

567
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,340
I'd rather dance.

568
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:57,112
Does anybody know
where there's an all-night monastery?

569
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:01,605
Who's the chick?

570
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:02,662
Anna Malatesta.

571
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:04,093
Lives on my block.

572
00:36:04,237 --> 00:36:06,308
A real live living doll, eh?

573
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:10,735
Nice.

574
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,105
What's the trouble, Frankie?
She's a snob.

575
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,846
She don't wanna talk to anybody.

576
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,863
Step down, pal.
This is a tag dance.

577
00:36:26,806 --> 00:36:27,908
We're not buying.

578
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:31,065
Sorry, friend. It's the rules.

579
00:36:31,094 --> 00:36:33,291
This is one big happy party.

580
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:35,709
Why don't we keep it that way, huh?

581
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,333
Let's get out of here.

582
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:46,321
Don't. That's Frankie Pellatrini. He's a prize fighter.
He'll kill you.

583
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:58,483
Apologize to the lady, Frankie.

584
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:01,853
How about it, Frankie?

585
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,421
I'm sorry.

586
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,001
She can't hear you.

587
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,691
I apologize. I apologize.

588
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:17,277
How about another waltz, fellas?

589
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:31,581
Hey!

590
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:33,406
How come the reception committee?

591
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:36,971
Ah, Anna's not home yet.

592
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:40,832
Look, mamma, it's almost 1 o'clock.

593
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:43,672
Good, I hope they don't come home all night.

594
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,202
Mamma!
Take your feet off the table.

595
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:50,194
You don't know, Pietro.
Your cousin, she is lonely.

596
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:52,309
Like Sylvio's lonely.

597
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,372
Enough there's one in the family.

598
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:56,982
Ah, leave me out of it, mamma.
You are sick with it.

599
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:58,723
No wife, no bambini.

600
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:01,299
I don't want your cousin she should be like that too.

601
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:07,175
Anna!

602
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,576
Did you have a good time?
Wonderful, thanks.

603
00:38:11,596 --> 00:38:14,091
Where's Joe, honey?
He's trying to find a place to park.

604
00:38:15,216 --> 00:38:17,134
Pietro, I love you!

605
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,835
You should have been there tonight.

606
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,366
Hey, Joe.

607
00:38:27,561 --> 00:38:29,690
What happened to you?

608
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,724
It's nothing.
Did somebody slug you?

609
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:34,592
Joe, tell them what you did to Frankie Pellatrini.

610
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,637
Frankie Pellatrini?
Forget it.

611
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:39,796
Oh, no, what happened.
Frankie started trouble...

612
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:42,981
so Joe made him apologize to me
in front of the whole room.

613
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:47,061
No!
He made him get right down on his knees
and apologize.

614
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,877
Frankie Pellatrini, wow!

615
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:53,392
I ran into Vince de Paul tonight.

616
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:56,085
He told me about you walking out
on the last poker game.

617
00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:58,530
He says he's waiting for you to come around
so he can get even.

618
00:38:58,532 --> 00:39:01,534
Ah, that pigeon.
He's lucky I left.

619
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:03,942
Another half an hour
and I would have owned his truck.

620
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:07,567
See you in the morning.

621
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:15,010
What's the matter with him?

622
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,042
I don't know. He suddenly got quiet
on the way home.

623
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:20,525
I thought it was on account of the fight.

624
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,081
No, it wasn't the fight.

625
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:26,161
That boy's got trouble.

626
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,725
Big trouble.

627
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:38,072
Hey, what are you all dressed up for?

628
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:42,007
Something I gotta do.
Is it okay if I take a couple of hours off?

629
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,323
Sure. Anything wrong?

630
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:47,758
No. I'm just gonna see a guy in Chinatown.

631
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,660
Ok. My turn to work tonight anyway.
See you at home.

632
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:52,121
Sure.

633
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,121
Alright, Joe. I'll check the name.

634
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:00,516
Frank? Gillen.

635
00:40:00,544 --> 00:40:03,478
Give me a run on Charles Cuneo.

636
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:05,600
Wait a minute.

637
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,036
Any description, Joe?

638
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:09,629
No, Frank.

639
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:10,995
Right.

640
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,285
Who is Charles Cuneo, Joe?

641
00:40:13,354 --> 00:40:16,452
I found out Malatesta wasn't playing cards
at the club like he said.

642
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,360
He left around 9 o'clock.

643
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:21,821
Said he was gonna meet a fella named Charlie Cuneo
and they were gonna shoot some snooker.

644
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,686
So far I haven't been able to find any Charlie Cuneo
and noone down here seems to know who he is.

645
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:27,916
Wait a minute, Joe.

646
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:29,459
Yeah, Frank.

647
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:31,442
No...

648
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:32,884
Alright, thanks.

649
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:35,417
Nothing on any Cuneo.

650
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,161
Did you check the phone book?

651
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:41,499
I did, and the City Directories.
I found seven Cuneos but no Charlie.

652
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:44,240
Check the utility companies and the motor vehicles.

653
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:48,087
If we don't come up with a Charles Cuneo,
Malatesta's got no alibi.

654
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,570
Right, Gillen. Bye.

655
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,175
Are you sure?
Sure I'm sure. I don't know any Charlie Cuneo.

656
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:13,538
Well, that wraps it, buddy.

657
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,789
The game was for only one thing.

658
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:23,861
The other is for what you know
about Charlie Cuneo.

659
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,111
What makes you think I know anything?

660
00:41:25,138 --> 00:41:27,526
You missed the setup
when I mentioned his name last night.

661
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:32,343
695 Clay Street, apartment 4C,
ask for for Veda.

662
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,259
Why Veda?

663
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:36,050
I do a little collecting for the bookies once in a while.
She likes the horses.

664
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,691
So do a lot of people.

665
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:40,393
Yeah, but they don't pay off
with checks signed by Charlie Cuneo.

666
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:42,975
Hey, buddy.

667
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:44,909
You didn't get it from me.

668
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,447
Yeah?

669
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:06,066
Veda?

670
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:08,565
That's right, honey.
What do you want?

671
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,870
I'm looking for a Charlie Cuneo.

672
00:42:10,891 --> 00:42:13,260
I don't know any Charlie Cuneo.

673
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:14,873
You play the horses, don't you?

674
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:17,720
Not me, mister. It's against the law.

675
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,085
Now get out of here.

676
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:24,402
Look. You gave one of our runners a check
you got from Charlie Cuneo...

677
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,834
it's bounced three times.
Now I wanna know where I can find him.

678
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,997
Ask his bank. I don't know who you are
and I don't know any Charlie Cuneo.

679
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,499
I'm not asking you for the money.
I'll willingly get that from Cuneo.

680
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:36,127
All I want to know from you
is where do I find him.

681
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:38,574
Veda what's going on out there?
Who are you talking to?

682
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:40,801
A salesman, honey.

683
00:42:40,804 --> 00:42:42,147
I'm just getting rid of him.

684
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:45,785
You don't want a busted head, mister.
Get out of here.

685
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:47,879
My husband works nights,
he needs to sleep.

686
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,757
Where do I find Charlie Cuneo?

687
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:51,726
Veda!

688
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:54,828
He's a married man.
I don't ask questions.

689
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:55,789
Veda!

690
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:58,682
Now beat it before you get the both of us killed.

691
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:15,516
Hey, Joe. How's my boy?

692
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,519
Fine.

693
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,458
What are you doing here at home?
I thought you were working tonight.

694
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,854
Pietro is there with Julio.

695
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:24,036
Did you see your friend?

696
00:43:24,055 --> 00:43:26,070
Hm?
That guy in Chinatown.

697
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:31,131
Oh, no, I couldn't find him.
I bought mamma some leechee nuts.

698
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,132
Leechee nuts and lotteries.
She's crazy about them.

699
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,590
Mamma should have been Chinese.

700
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:38,809
Hey, Joe, how come you were looking
for Charlie Cuneo?

701
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:42,968
How did you know?

702
00:43:43,108 --> 00:43:44,892
A customer told me.

703
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:47,591
Well, Charlie's an old friend of mine.

704
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:49,261
Yeah?
Uh-hm.

705
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,176
No kidding.
Oh, yeah.

706
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,961
Come here.

707
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:59,072
They're always doing things like that.

708
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:00,598
How's this for a surprise?

709
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:04,276
Charlie Cuneo.

710
00:44:11,017 --> 00:44:14,660
Hey, what did you do to your hair?

711
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:16,837
I washed it.

712
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:19,249
Anna, go see that everything is ready.

713
00:44:19,275 --> 00:44:21,155
Now that Joe's here we can eat.

714
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:30,399
Here, mamma. Take a leechee nut.

715
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:34,143
Oh, Joe, leechee nuts!
Hey, what's the matter with you two?

716
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:36,740
You act as if you've never seen
each other before.

717
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:40,524
The Charlie Cuneo I know is a tall skinny fella.

718
00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:44,701
But when I told you about Joe
you said you knew him.

719
00:44:44,704 --> 00:44:47,486
Goodtime Charlie thinks he knows everybody.

720
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:51,008
After four beers nobody in a bar
is a stranger.

721
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,108
See, Rosa. There's another Charlie Cuneo.

722
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,948
He's the one's been doing all the things
she's blaming me for.

723
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,800
That would take six men.

724
00:44:58,806 --> 00:44:59,766
Very funny.

725
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,983
So you didn't know each other before.

726
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,402
Now you do.

727
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,850
Well, what do you think of him?

728
00:45:05,876 --> 00:45:08,495
This is Anna's Joe.

729
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:11,578
Nice to meet you Mr. Cuneo.
Call me Charlie.

730
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:14,063
The ball and chain here is Rosa.

731
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,576
Everybody to the table, eh?

732
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:23,940
What's the matter with you?

733
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,687
Big surprise, mamma.

734
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,496
Nobody's surprised but me.

735
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:29,334
Come on, Joe.

736
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,416
I'm gonna go wash up.

737
00:45:35,413 --> 00:45:36,467
Joe.

738
00:45:37,673 --> 00:45:39,111
Joe, what's wrong?

739
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:41,323
Nothing, why?

740
00:45:41,348 --> 00:45:43,170
I think there is.

741
00:45:43,165 --> 00:45:45,313
Do you really know a Charlie Cuneo?

742
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,863
Sure. He owes me $50,
that's why I was looking for him.

743
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:51,765
I watched your face when you came in.

744
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:55,248
I think you had more on your mind than $50.

745
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:57,387
What are you talking about?

746
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,419
I just don't understand
the way you act sometimes.

747
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:05,056
Everything is fine,
then all of a sudden you change...

748
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:07,943
like you were thinking of something
you wanted to forget.

749
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:09,878
Anna, Joe, dinner!

750
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:12,015
What is it? Can't you tell me?

751
00:46:12,046 --> 00:46:14,473
Honey, there's nothing to tell.

752
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:16,023
Hi, everybody.

753
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,727
You're late.

754
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:26,359
Very well. I have no right to pry
into your secrets.

755
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,586
They are waiting for us.

756
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,389
And they're still talking about it
in Petaluma.

757
00:46:37,456 --> 00:46:40,670
Now get this picture.
I'm working off five straight strikes, see?

758
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:44,440
I take the ball and whamo!
A perfect shot.

759
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:47,189
So what happens? A seven/ten split.

760
00:46:47,198 --> 00:46:49,692
I don't know whether to cry or to get mad.

761
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:52,357
So I get mad.
I take the ball again.

762
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,102
Nobody ever threw a ball so hard.

763
00:46:57,035 --> 00:47:00,413
The ten pin hits the side of the alley,
bounces over to the seven pin

764
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,393
I get my spare and a 278 game.

765
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:05,314
Am I lying, Rosa?

766
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:08,009
How do I know?
I never get out of the house.

767
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,118
Do you bowl, Joe?

768
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,325
No, no. I shoot pool.

769
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:16,360
Bowling is too expensive.
So is pool.

770
00:47:16,372 --> 00:47:17,811
If you play with me.

771
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:19,492
Here he goes again.

772
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:21,219
I don't know why you always play with him.

773
00:47:21,254 --> 00:47:24,073
All I ever hear is about how much money
he takes away from you.

774
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:27,267
Just once I'd like him to come home a loser.

775
00:47:27,274 --> 00:47:29,864
That'll be the day.
You know, Joe?

776
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:31,761
Sylvio is my private pigeon.

777
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,663
Whenever business is bad on Saturday nights

778
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:37,338
I drive down from Petaluma
to play a little snooker with Sylvio.

779
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,736
Last time I come down I had to take him
out of a poker game to slaughter him.

780
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:42,197
So I heard.

781
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,786
The fellas at the Vallejo Club
are a little hecked at Sylvio.

782
00:47:47,107 --> 00:47:49,131
But I thought that was Friday night.

783
00:47:50,691 --> 00:47:54,910
Oh, sure. That's right. Saturday Rose's mother
was coming. I had to stay home.

784
00:47:54,948 --> 00:47:57,777
So what does he do?
Sleeps all day.

785
00:47:57,819 --> 00:48:01,559
Why?
Because he doesn't get to bed until 3 o'clock.

786
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:05,240
I was waiting for you to get to that.

787
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:06,870
Sylvio. Tell her.

788
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,803
What time did I leave you?

789
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:11,536
Oh, about 1 o'clock.

790
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:13,126
It was one twenty.

791
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:16,078
Took me an hour and thirty minutes
to drive home.

792
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:18,488
Ten minutes to get undressed.

793
00:48:18,546 --> 00:48:22,460
Anna, you're a nice girl.
When you get married, please trust your husband...

794
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:24,442
don't keep track of every minute of his time.

795
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:28,162
A lot of reasons I got to trust you.
Please, Rosa, we're not home.

796
00:48:30,183 --> 00:48:32,580
We're all finished.
Let's go to the other room.

797
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,919
Come on, Charlie. I got a beautiful
Bolla Galleano. I want you to try it.

798
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:45,339
It's going to be a lovely evening.
I've seen those two when they get started.

799
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,123
They're wonderful. Everything is wonderful.

800
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:51,369
Joe, you feel alright?
I've never felt better in my life.

801
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:57,410
I gotta go uptown. Keep the party going
and I'll be back as quickly as I can.

802
00:48:57,492 --> 00:48:59,985
I've got something to celebrate tonight.

803
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:10,209
You know better than to bring me fried rice.

804
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,405
With my stomach it's got to be boiled.

805
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:18,848
Too much lousy whiskey, uh?

806
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:21,502
Too much lousy chow yuck.

807
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:23,906
And you did it to me.
You and your cooks.

808
00:49:23,937 --> 00:49:26,930
You miserable excuse for a Chinese
restaurant owner.

809
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:30,599
Hey, Joe.

810
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,875
What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you.

811
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,687
I called the Hall and they said
you always eat here.

812
00:49:37,756 --> 00:49:40,010
I've had the Chinatown beat for 20 years.

813
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,517
Now I'm a rice addict.

814
00:49:43,455 --> 00:49:44,471
What's on your mind?

815
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:48,061
I want you to put me on the reinstatement list.
I'm ready to go back to work.

816
00:49:48,074 --> 00:49:50,165
You're pretty hard to keep up with, kid.

817
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,234
I've still got a couple of  guys
trying to find that Charlie Cuneo for you.

818
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:56,113
He found me. And everything checks out
right down to the line.

819
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:59,013
He was with Sylvio the night
Father Tomasino was killed.

820
00:49:59,153 --> 00:50:00,881
They were playing snooker until after 1 o'clock.

821
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:02,832
Sylvio is as clean as a bird.

822
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,849
You sound mighty happy about it.

823
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:09,196
He loved Father Tomasino. He was grieving for him
as much as we all were.

824
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:11,074
On him it looked different.

825
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:12,551
You know, Kilrain was right.

826
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:14,763
A man isn't guilty by the look on his face.

827
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:18,793
And I spent an hour with Kilrain this morning
trying to convince him that he might be wrong.

828
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:21,043
Every lead we've had is going sour.

829
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,586
Now this happens.

830
00:50:23,907 --> 00:50:25,969
I don't know what I would have done
if it had been Malatesta.

831
00:50:25,978 --> 00:50:28,903
As much as I want to do something
for Father Tomasino.

832
00:50:29,877 --> 00:50:32,276
The way it worked out
he's done something for you.

833
00:50:33,203 --> 00:50:35,217
You said yourself you've never had a home.

834
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:37,262
Maybe this was his way of finding you one.

835
00:50:39,087 --> 00:50:42,157
Well, I'll see what I can do about speeding up
your reinstatement.

836
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,123
How about a cup of tea?

837
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:45,157
No, thanks. I gotta do some shopping
before the stores close.

838
00:50:45,162 --> 00:50:48,999
Do you know any place I can go
without being treated like a tourist?

839
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:51,417
Sammy Yun. Right down the street.

840
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,477
Tell him I sent you.

841
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:54,453
You know what I'm gonna do for you
if this works out?

842
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,332
I'm gonna buy you a pair of chopsticks.

843
00:50:56,335 --> 00:50:57,965
Gold-plated.

844
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:11,407
Where have you been?

845
00:51:11,413 --> 00:51:12,757
What's all that?

846
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:17,359
Where are the Cuneos?
Boy, you ducked out just in time.

847
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:19,264
It turned into a first-class battle.

848
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,805
Our house wasn't big enough for them

849
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:22,976
so they went home
where they could have more room to fight.

850
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:24,262
Aw, that's fine.

851
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,745
Well I got Charlie a couple of bottles of champagne.

852
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:28,304
What are you buying wine for him?

853
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:30,699
He loused up the whole evening.
Not for me, he didn't.

854
00:51:30,706 --> 00:51:33,009
Tell you what. We'll save this one for Charlie
and we'll have the other one.

855
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:36,070
Mamma, I got something for you.

856
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:42,014
A bag of leechee nuts.
I haven't touched the others yet.

857
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:47,382
And another present for you.
Oh, my goodness.

858
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:49,770
What's in it?
Open it.

859
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:52,848
Come on, come on.

860
00:51:57,472 --> 00:51:59,889
Chinese pajamas?
Brocaded in solid gold thread.

861
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:02,443
The man at the store said the dragons
will never turn green.

862
00:52:02,468 --> 00:52:06,506
What am I gonna do with it?
You wear them when you eat the leechee nuts, silly.

863
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:11,631
Don't I get something for it,
like a little kiss?

864
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:14,131
Oh, sure, Joe.

865
00:52:14,136 --> 00:52:16,236
Peanuts!
Is peanuts home yet?

866
00:52:17,145 --> 00:52:18,488
Look what I got for peanuts.

867
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:22,776
It's a body-building set, You know,
for arms, the legs, the back and everything else.

868
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:25,813
Where's Anna?
Upstairs.

869
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,986
Sylvio.

870
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:31,892
For Sylvio.

871
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:37,050
A fishing pole?
Oh, no, Joe.

872
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:39,190
You sure you didn't pick
the wrong package at the store?

873
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:40,746
You're a dope. It's a pool cue.

874
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,560
Best snooker player in San Francisco
helped me pick it out for you.

875
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,438
If you can't beat Charlie with that
you might as well give up the game.

876
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:54,814
Oh, Joe, it's beautiful.
I don't know what to say.

877
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,190
Just say you're my friend and shake my hand.

878
00:52:57,273 --> 00:52:58,616
What for? We never fight.

879
00:52:58,738 --> 00:53:00,176
Just shake my hand.

880
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:02,464
I don't understand, Joe, but you're my boy.

881
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,634
Excuse me.

882
00:53:08,629 --> 00:53:11,487
Oh. Open the wine.
We'll be right down.

883
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,012
Whatever his trouble was, it's over now.

884
00:53:17,756 --> 00:53:19,387
Just a second.

885
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:25,581
For me?

886
00:53:25,634 --> 00:53:26,737
Why?

887
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,322
Because I love you and want to marry you.

888
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:32,864
Don't play games with me, Joe.

889
00:53:32,872 --> 00:53:34,215
I'm not playing any games with you.

890
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,488
I wanna marry you.

891
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:38,945
What about the things that were bothering you?

892
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:40,944
The secrets you wouldn't talk about.

893
00:53:40,978 --> 00:53:42,561
They're gone.

894
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:44,005
But you had them.

895
00:53:44,084 --> 00:53:45,475
They're gone now.

896
00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:48,787
How can I be sure?

897
00:53:51,014 --> 00:53:53,872
No, Joe. It has to be for real.
Not halfways.

898
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,382
I need you, Anna.

899
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,923
I need you very, very much.

900
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,939
Holy sweet Maria.
Hey, mamma!

901
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,283
Mamma, it's happened.

902
00:54:09,304 --> 00:54:12,478
My little Anna.
My little Anna.

903
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:15,462
We're gonna get married.
You're telling me?

904
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:18,637
I'm so happy I'm gonna cry.

905
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:23,961
Joe, I'm gonna throw you the biggest wedding
North Beach has ever seen.

906
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:26,838
When do you want it?
Wait a minute. Don't rush it.

907
00:54:26,855 --> 00:54:28,783
We haven't even had a chance
to talk about it.

908
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,909
What is there to talk about?
I'll give you until next Sunday.

909
00:54:30,924 --> 00:54:32,938
We have open house.
We tell everybody, eh?

910
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:35,324
Let's go downstairs.
We drink some champagne, yeah?

911
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:46,366
Hey, Sylvio. You only got two bottles.
You gonna run out pretty soon, you know that.

912
00:54:46,494 --> 00:54:48,278
The Pacific Ocean will run dry first.

913
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:51,810
Everybody with an empty glass.
Bottoms up!

914
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,179
Let's drink up.
You want some wine?

915
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,174
Ah, mamma.
No, no.

916
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:05,755
Anything wrong with the wine?
No, I had two glasses already. That's enough.

917
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:07,166
Come on, have another one.
No.

918
00:55:07,197 --> 00:55:09,930
Then maybe you put on your new Chinese pajamas
and show everybody.

919
00:55:11,956 --> 00:55:13,529
There, my mamma.

920
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:17,865
Now only your daughter is left, Mrs. Bragiotto.

921
00:55:17,886 --> 00:55:20,389
All she does is look at television.

922
00:55:20,394 --> 00:55:22,887
The only men she sees are selling soap.

923
00:55:22,965 --> 00:55:26,232
I keep telling her.
You can win money on television...

924
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:31,040
have vacation, a mink coat, an automobile...
But a husband? No.

925
00:55:31,096 --> 00:55:33,302
I guess she's going to be with me forever.

926
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:35,754
Maybe you should break the television.

927
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:39,089
Right.
There's always hope.

928
00:55:39,984 --> 00:55:42,160
Hey, Joey. Joey,
Yes?

929
00:55:42,162 --> 00:55:44,109
You and me gonna have a little talk.

930
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,334
I'm gonna teach you how to handle
your wife.

931
00:55:46,353 --> 00:55:48,473
Is that right?
Sure. First you get a whip,

932
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:49,826
and then a chair.

933
00:55:49,881 --> 00:55:52,288
And then you tell her who's the boss.

934
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:55,115
And remember.
There's gotta be one boss to a house.

935
00:55:55,123 --> 00:55:58,383
When are you gonna tell me
who's the boss in our house?

936
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:02,482
Of course you gotta tell them slowly, nice, gently.

937
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:04,282
I've been married 22 years to my wife.

938
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,606
But some of these days...

939
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:12,000
Quiet everybody, quiet!
Everybody shut up.

940
00:56:12,017 --> 00:56:13,907
I wanna make a toast.

941
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,322
To Joe Martini.

942
00:56:18,353 --> 00:56:20,846
My future cousin and partner.

943
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:23,919
Now wait a minute, Sylvio.
Another glass of wine and you'll give me the house.

944
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,512
What's the matter?
Don't you wanna be my partner?

945
00:56:26,535 --> 00:56:28,068
Ok, I'll give you the store.

946
00:56:28,124 --> 00:56:30,695
And the boat. You be the boss.
I work for you. Ok?

947
00:56:32,148 --> 00:56:35,506
To Joe and Anna.
And ten little bambini.

948
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,289
Bravo!

949
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:40,962
Noisy, isn't it?

950
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:43,080
I never thought we had so many friends.

951
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:45,059
There isn't a soul in the house.

952
00:56:46,718 --> 00:56:48,732
Hold it, Joe.
I wanna get a picture.

953
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,226
Hey, Raoul. Bring the camera.

954
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:53,058
You get outta there.

955
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:57,364
Yes, keep kissing.

956
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:01,379
Joe, there's some guy outside
wants to see you.

957
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:02,829
Tell him I'll see him in a week.
Tell him to come in.

958
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:05,242
I can't. I'm on the phone.
Anyway, he says he's double-parked.

959
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,984
Excuse me, boss.
I am the boss.

960
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,336
Anna, Anna...

961
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:17,106
I'm telling you, Gillespie.
It's the second emancipation proclamation.

962
00:57:17,118 --> 00:57:18,364
It's true, Gillespie.

963
00:57:18,408 --> 00:57:20,776
Why don't you come over and bring
some of those Sacred Heart girls?

964
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:23,957
Why not?
Everyone else in the neighborhood's here.

965
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:31,926
So you finally showed, eh?
Get parked and come on up.

966
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,311
No, Joe.
It's gonna be alright.

967
00:57:33,322 --> 00:57:34,846
But don't mention I was a cop.

968
00:57:34,938 --> 00:57:36,234
After we get upstairs,

969
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:39,175
you and I will find a nice quiet corner
and then we'll decide how we're gonna break it.

970
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:40,804
Get in, Joe.
I gotta...

971
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:49,524
What's this all about, Gillen?

972
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,195
This is Frank Wilkens.
He heads up a detective agency.

973
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:53,261
Hi.
Hi.

974
00:57:53,414 --> 00:57:54,757
Well, what did you wanna...

975
00:57:54,765 --> 00:57:57,092
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta get back to the party.

976
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,968
This is more important.
It'll only take a few minutes.

977
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:01,644
I brought Frank along and
thought maybe you'd like to talk to him.

978
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:02,887
About what?

979
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:04,486
Take a look.

980
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,129
Filed yesterday.

981
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:08,612
It's a beating report.
Yes.

982
00:58:08,669 --> 00:58:11,258
The guy worked his wife over.
What's that got to do with me?

983
00:58:11,263 --> 00:58:13,248
The guy's name is Albert Pinnelli.

984
00:58:13,263 --> 00:58:17,378
Wife, Veda Pinelli.
I met her. She probably had it coming.

985
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:18,492
She did.

986
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:21,954
Pinnelli knew she was holding hands with somebody
and hired me to find out who it was.

987
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:24,203
Took a trip to Petaluma to get a name for him.

988
00:58:24,205 --> 00:58:25,739
Charlie Cuneo.

989
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,817
You called it.

990
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:29,816
When I spotted his name in Pinelli's statement
I got in touch with Frank.

991
00:58:30,788 --> 00:58:32,994
The priest was killed Friday, May 11th.

992
00:58:32,998 --> 00:58:35,299
Wanna read the report yourself
or can I tell you?

993
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:36,407
Which is quicker?

994
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:39,169
It's a long report.
We gotta earn our fee.

995
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:44,320
Frank tailed Veda to the Horizon club.
She got there at 9:17.

996
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:47,019
Charlie Cuneo and another guy
were sitting at the table waiting for her.

997
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,518
Frank checked, the other guy was Malatesta.

998
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,924
At 9:50 Veda and Cuneo left.

999
00:58:51,936 --> 00:58:54,363
They visited a half a dozen bars, they had drinks,
they danced.

1000
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,052
Cuneo made a couple of phone calls.

1001
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:58,832
At 12:57 they got back to the Horizon Club.

1002
00:58:58,837 --> 00:59:00,563
Malatesta was waiting for them.

1003
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:02,391
Then he was there all the time.

1004
00:59:02,392 --> 00:59:05,949
It could be.
But we were paid to tail the dame.

1005
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:07,976
There's one thing for sure, Joe.

1006
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:09,661
Malatesta's been lying.

1007
00:59:09,681 --> 00:59:11,704
First he lied about playing cards at the Vallejo Club.

1008
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:14,499
Then he lied about playing snooker with Cuneo.
They both lied about that.

1009
00:59:14,586 --> 00:59:18,403
All that proves is that Cuneo didn't want his wife
to know that he'd been running around

1010
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:20,408
and he was using Malatesta to cover up for him.

1011
00:59:20,616 --> 00:59:22,803
Kilrain sees it the other way.

1012
00:59:22,818 --> 00:59:25,666
Have you ever been to the Horizon Club, Joe?
No.

1013
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,594
It's less than two blocks
from where the priest was killed.

1014
00:59:28,602 --> 00:59:30,692
The back door leads to the same alley.

1015
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:33,983
Aw, come on, Gillen. There must be a hundred doors
leading to the same alley.

1016
00:59:35,335 --> 00:59:37,618
Kilrain talked about me grabbing at air.

1017
00:59:37,628 --> 00:59:40,535
Nobody's grabbing at air.
We've got one thing to work on.

1018
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,492
Malatesta's alibi is out the window.

1019
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:44,354
We'll take it step by step from there.

1020
00:59:45,893 --> 00:59:47,679
Kilrain wants to see you tomorrow.

1021
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,188
Want us to take you back?
No.

1022
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:55,462
Let me off here.
I gotta do some thinking.

1023
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:17,263
Hey, Joe.

1024
01:00:20,847 --> 01:00:22,123
Where have you been?

1025
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:24,256
I've been looking for you all over the neighborhood.

1026
01:00:24,263 --> 01:00:25,702
Thought I'd get some air.

1027
01:00:25,729 --> 01:00:27,359
The wine, eh?

1028
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:33,237
Drunk on six little glasses of wine.
Ah, Joe, I gotta teach you how to handle that stuff.

1029
01:00:33,242 --> 01:00:35,927
Smart fella, though.
You didn't let Anna see you drunk.

1030
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,561
Plenty of time for that later.

1031
01:00:37,661 --> 01:00:39,292
You'd better not park there.
You'll get a ticket.

1032
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,652
Joe.

1033
01:00:54,343 --> 01:00:55,782
Hello, Anna...

1034
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:58,845
I'm sorry I had to duck out,
but something came up.

1035
01:00:58,853 --> 01:01:00,867
What, Joe?
What's wrong?

1036
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:03,818
I got some bad news about a friend.

1037
01:01:06,887 --> 01:01:07,962
Who?

1038
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,955
My head's coming apart.
Why don't we talk about it in the morning?

1039
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:16,134
Joe.

1040
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:19,439
They're back, aren't they?

1041
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:22,741
What?
The troubles. You've got them again.

1042
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:25,128
What is it? Can't you tell me?

1043
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:28,421
It's something I have to work out for myself.

1044
01:01:28,467 --> 01:01:30,338
Maybe if I knew I could help.

1045
01:01:30,348 --> 01:01:31,845
Forget it.

1046
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:35,010
We can call it all off, Joe.

1047
01:01:35,032 --> 01:01:37,430
What are you talking about?
I won't hold you to it.

1048
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,946
You don't have to marry me.

1049
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:43,947
You're right back the way you were.

1050
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:47,592
I knew you would be
when you stayed away so long.

1051
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,725
I've been going crazy thinking about it.

1052
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:57,039
Joe, would it make it easier
if we don't get married?

1053
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:59,956
Anna, it's the one thing I'm trying to hold on to.

1054
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,974
Then you have to let me out.

1055
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:06,186
I can't face life with you in peeks and drops
with no in-between.

1056
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:10,586
It's bad enough now.
I can't talk about it. You've gotta understand.

1057
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,806
How can I? How can I?

1058
01:02:13,706 --> 01:02:16,448
You don't even tell me
what I'm supposed to understand.

1059
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,595
One way or another it'll straighten itself out
in the next couple of days.

1060
01:02:20,815 --> 01:02:23,692
I hope you understand that.

1061
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:30,329
Joe. Joe.

1062
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:37,929
Let him alone, Anna.
Why, Sylvio?

1063
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,746
Sylvio.

1064
01:02:42,774 --> 01:02:46,178
Something terrible is gnawing at him.

1065
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:51,396
I've got to know.
I've got to find out what it is.

1066
01:02:51,824 --> 01:02:53,550
Alright, honey, my baby.

1067
01:03:02,265 --> 01:03:03,723
Excuse me.
Yes?

1068
01:03:03,743 --> 01:03:06,716
I would like some information
about a boy who was raised here.

1069
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:08,803
Mother Catherine would be the one to see.

1070
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:09,980
She isn't in now.

1071
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:12,543
Who is it you wanted to ask about?

1072
01:03:12,574 --> 01:03:15,218
His name is Martini. Joe Martini.

1073
01:03:15,229 --> 01:03:16,754
Are you a friend of Joe's?

1074
01:03:16,821 --> 01:03:20,515
We are planning to get married.
You are?

1075
01:03:21,566 --> 01:03:24,174
Mother Catherine is not only going to be surprised.

1076
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,319
She's going to be hurt that Joe hasn't told her.

1077
01:03:26,478 --> 01:03:28,588
As a matter of fact we haven't seen him in weeks.

1078
01:03:28,634 --> 01:03:31,263
Before that, was he coming here often?

1079
01:03:31,304 --> 01:03:32,935
At least a couple of times a week.

1080
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:34,890
He's a great favorite with the children.

1081
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:36,615
Especially when he's in uniform.

1082
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:38,921
Uniform?

1083
01:03:38,999 --> 01:03:40,390
His police uniform.

1084
01:03:40,426 --> 01:03:44,551
When he walks through the door
even the toughest little monsters quiet down.

1085
01:03:44,562 --> 01:03:47,151
You have no idea how we've missed him.

1086
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:50,726
How long has Joe been a policeman?

1087
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:52,370
Ever since I've known him.

1088
01:03:52,406 --> 01:03:54,210
I've been here a year.

1089
01:03:54,225 --> 01:03:56,527
Joe is still on the Police Force, isn't he?

1090
01:04:00,651 --> 01:04:02,130
I don't know.

1091
01:04:07,596 --> 01:04:09,054
Oh, about five minutes ago.

1092
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,527
No.

1093
01:04:11,536 --> 01:04:13,262
No, I can't look at it.

1094
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:15,846
Will do. Bye.

1095
01:04:15,863 --> 01:04:17,588
Yes, miss?

1096
01:04:17,705 --> 01:04:19,691
I'd like to see the Chief of Police, please.

1097
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:22,189
I'm sorry, he's gone to City Hall.
He won't be back this afternoon.

1098
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:23,730
Can anyone else help you?

1099
01:04:23,782 --> 01:04:26,783
I'd like some information about a police officer.

1100
01:04:26,802 --> 01:04:28,797
His name?
Joe Martini.

1101
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:31,628
May I ask who you are?

1102
01:04:31,655 --> 01:04:33,190
Anna Malatesta.

1103
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,469
I'm sorry. I can't give you any information
about Martini.

1104
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:39,057
Can you tell me if he's still with the Department.

1105
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,478
We're not releasing anything about him.

1106
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,287
He's in some kind of trouble, isn't he?

1107
01:04:45,316 --> 01:04:47,618
What is it? Why did he lose his job?

1108
01:04:47,645 --> 01:04:51,154
I have a right to know.
I'm engaged to marry him.

1109
01:04:51,162 --> 01:04:52,784
I'm sorry, miss.

1110
01:04:54,915 --> 01:04:58,473
Who can I see? There must be somebody
with authority to tell me.

1111
01:04:58,483 --> 01:05:01,015
I'm afraid not. We have strict orders.

1112
01:05:04,505 --> 01:05:06,423
Thank you.

1113
01:05:17,558 --> 01:05:19,093
Lt. Kilrain?
Gillen.

1114
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:20,687
Martini get there?

1115
01:05:20,887 --> 01:05:22,038
I'm coming up.

1116
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:28,489
Mrs. Pinelli, your husband isn't here.

1117
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,781
Even if he was,
he knows you were with Cuneo that night.

1118
01:05:31,975 --> 01:05:35,313
Now you got nothing to lose and you can help us
if you'll answer a few questions.

1119
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:37,365
What's to answer?

1120
01:05:37,378 --> 01:05:39,018
That private eye wrote it all up.

1121
01:05:39,025 --> 01:05:41,327
I've got this to show for it.

1122
01:05:42,876 --> 01:05:44,400
Please try to remember.

1123
01:05:44,415 --> 01:05:48,146
Exactly what happened after you met
Cuneo and Malatesta at the Horizon Club?

1124
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:50,961
Remember? I'll never forget it.

1125
01:05:51,444 --> 01:05:52,884
Some gag.

1126
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,405
Collector for a book.

1127
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:56,156
I should have pegged you for a cop.

1128
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:57,797
He asked a question, Veda.

1129
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,494
Well, the whole evening was a mess.

1130
01:06:00,509 --> 01:06:03,291
Always was before Charlie
came in from the club on Saturday nights.

1131
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:05,946
He'd tell his wife he was coming in to play snooker
with Malatesta.

1132
01:06:05,952 --> 01:06:08,119
They'd play until about twelve.

1133
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:09,708
Then Charly'd come by to see me.

1134
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:14,962
Who's watching the store?

1135
01:06:14,966 --> 01:06:18,030
If I'd known there was going to be this big an audience
I would have brought my baubles.

1136
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,286
Go on.

1137
01:06:19,368 --> 01:06:22,389
Why was I a dope to see Charlie
on a Friday night?

1138
01:06:22,431 --> 01:06:25,059
My husband works a split shift
and gets home by two.

1139
01:06:25,101 --> 01:06:27,729
Charlie was stubborn so I said okay.

1140
01:06:27,741 --> 01:06:31,971
We made a date for 9 o'clock.
When I walked in he was with his pal Sylvio.

1141
01:06:31,994 --> 01:06:33,913
Not a bad-looking guy.

1142
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:35,906
First I was kinda glad Charlie brought him along.

1143
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:38,376
What a clump he turned out to be.

1144
01:06:38,384 --> 01:06:41,107
He was beefing when I walked in
and kept on beefing.

1145
01:06:41,128 --> 01:06:43,719
He didn't approve of Charlie
stepping out on his wife.

1146
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:45,946
And he was all teed off at being used as an alibi.

1147
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:48,084
Is that why you and Cuneo left him?

1148
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:50,640
It was either that
or bust a chair over his head.

1149
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:52,894
Would I tell that clump off.

1150
01:06:52,906 --> 01:06:57,642
I asked if his life was so pure and lily-white
that he could go around telling other people what to do.

1151
01:06:57,654 --> 01:06:58,709
He sure took it big.

1152
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:00,339
I thought he was gonna slug me.

1153
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:03,269
So I walked and Charlie went with me.

1154
01:07:03,277 --> 01:07:06,432
Did Cuneo leave you at all
any time during the evening?

1155
01:07:06,437 --> 01:07:08,183
No, only when he went to use the phone.

1156
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:09,555
Who did he call?

1157
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:12,026
He was trying to reach Sylvio
back at the Horizon Club.

1158
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,764
He was afraid the square
would get in touch with his wife.

1159
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:16,644
Did he talk to him?

1160
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:17,911
No. He wasn't there.

1161
01:07:18,058 --> 01:07:19,711
Exactly what time was that?

1162
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:22,166
I was in no mood for exact time.

1163
01:07:22,176 --> 01:07:23,289
Well, approximately.

1164
01:07:23,988 --> 01:07:27,785
The first time about an hour after we left.
Maybe 10:30.

1165
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:30,103
Tried again an hour later

1166
01:07:30,141 --> 01:07:32,839
then around 1 o'clock
we went back to the club and he was there.

1167
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:36,955
Are you sure he wasn't there all the time.
Maybe he just didn't want to answer the phone.

1168
01:07:36,959 --> 01:07:39,136
Charlie jumped him about that right away.

1169
01:07:39,153 --> 01:07:41,243
Sylvio said he went out for about an hour.

1170
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:42,582
He wanted some air.

1171
01:07:42,587 --> 01:07:45,091
And that's all he said for the rest of the night.

1172
01:07:45,198 --> 01:07:47,807
Just sat there and stared at us.

1173
01:07:47,825 --> 01:07:49,528
Gave me the creeps.

1174
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:51,309
I don't think the guy was in his right mind.

1175
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:55,910
That'll be all Mrs. Pinelli, thanks

1176
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:58,075
If there's anything more
we'll get in touch with you later.

1177
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,854
Before I go I'd like to set one thing straight.

1178
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:07,402
Charly's a clod but he's a good spender.

1179
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:09,500
Likes to dance, hold hands,

1180
01:08:09,546 --> 01:08:11,905
have somebody around to laugh at his lousy jokes.

1181
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:13,698
But that's all there was between us.

1182
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:15,582
I wouldn't want you thinking
there was any more than that.

1183
01:08:15,609 --> 01:08:18,195
If you can sell that to your husband
I'll buy it too.

1184
01:08:28,663 --> 01:08:31,674
Well, I guess that marks it in, son.
I'll take it from here.

1185
01:08:31,677 --> 01:08:33,634
No.
Let him.

1186
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:36,524
It'll be easier on you.

1187
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,094
Anna Malatesta just left my office.

1188
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:42,422
Somehow she found out you were a cop.

1189
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:45,378
She thinks you're up to your neck in trouble
and that's how you lost your badge.

1190
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:47,011
I couldn't tell her any different.

1191
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:51,584
Look, I know this is rough on you, son,
I wish it didn't have to be.

1192
01:08:52,647 --> 01:08:54,375
Where do we pick up Malatesta?

1193
01:08:54,388 --> 01:08:57,601
Lieutenant, you haven't got a motive.
A man doesn't kill without a reason.

1194
01:08:58,207 --> 01:08:59,904
Maybe he had one.

1195
01:09:00,692 --> 01:09:02,053
We just don't know it yet.

1196
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:04,357
Look, Martini...

1197
01:09:04,365 --> 01:09:08,297
for weeks you've been on my hair
trying to blow the whistle on Malatesta.

1198
01:09:08,303 --> 01:09:09,549
We wouldn't buy it.

1199
01:09:09,717 --> 01:09:11,893
Now we're ready to
and you're on our hair again.

1200
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:13,535
Just where do you stand?

1201
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:17,741
Lieutenant, if Malatesta killed Father Tomasino
I'll walk him to the gas chamber myself.

1202
01:09:17,752 --> 01:09:21,780
But all we've got so far is the fact that he wasn't
at the Horizon Club for about an hour.

1203
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:24,675
That still doesn't put the knife in his hand.
He could have been out for some air...

1204
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:25,971
he could have gone to the movies.

1205
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:28,082
But you pick him up now
and the papers will get it.

1206
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:30,223
I'm thinking of what it's gonna do to his family.

1207
01:09:30,812 --> 01:09:33,123
His mother, the kid brother, his cousin.

1208
01:09:33,137 --> 01:09:35,555
That's why I told you to stay out of it.

1209
01:09:35,565 --> 01:09:37,828
I don't have to think about his family.
I can't.

1210
01:09:37,848 --> 01:09:41,081
That's one of the things about this job
that makes it stink sometimes.

1211
01:09:41,334 --> 01:09:43,837
You threw a lot of maybes at me.

1212
01:09:43,849 --> 01:09:46,730
Well the only answer to them is Malatesta.

1213
01:09:46,734 --> 01:09:48,071
Pick him up, Summers.

1214
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:50,881
Lieutenant, unless you get a confession
you've got no case.

1215
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:52,364
And you're not gonna get any.

1216
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:56,551
I know him. I've talked to him about Father Tomasino
and he doesn't turn a hair.

1217
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:58,590
All he will tell you is that he loved the priest.

1218
01:09:58,599 --> 01:10:01,150
In 72 hours you're gonna have
to let him go again.

1219
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:02,842
Well, isn't that what you want?

1220
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:05,886
Maybe you can close the book on this case.
I can't. I've gotta know.

1221
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:08,517
I still have a chance with him.
You haven't.

1222
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:12,308
All I ask for is a couple of days.
You've had almost a month.

1223
01:10:12,316 --> 01:10:13,764
But I've got different cards now.

1224
01:10:13,766 --> 01:10:16,279
If I play them right,
Malatesta will walk in here by himself.

1225
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,782
What can you lose?

1226
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:20,899
It'll make it easier for all of us
if he can pull it off.

1227
01:10:20,907 --> 01:10:23,497
I haven't heard anything yet
to make me think he can.

1228
01:10:24,177 --> 01:10:26,144
Anna thinks I'm jammed up in something.

1229
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:28,642
I'm gonna keep working this angle
until it gets to Sylvio.

1230
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:31,681
I know him. If he thinks I'm out on a limb
he's gonna try to get me off.

1231
01:10:35,534 --> 01:10:38,319
You still got your gun?
Yeah, but I got it packed away.

1232
01:10:38,328 --> 01:10:39,921
Well, get it and keep it on you.

1233
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:41,666
I think Malatesta is our man.

1234
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,509
And to me he adds up a killer.
And a violent one.

1235
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,110
You don't know him.
All I know is what you told me.

1236
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:50,020
He's kind and he's gentle and he likes you.

1237
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:52,235
Well, he loved Father Tomasino.

1238
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,841
You carry that gun. That's an order.

1239
01:10:54,906 --> 01:10:56,168
Yes, sir.

1240
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:14,724
Hello, Joe.
Hello, mamma.

1241
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:18,635
Why are you home?
Sylvio said you were working tonight.

1242
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,199
I'm on my way to the store now.
I forgot something and came to get it.

1243
01:11:22,796 --> 01:11:23,981
Joe.

1244
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:29,005
Maybe you can tell me.
What's the matter with Anna?

1245
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:30,546
What's happening in this house?

1246
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:32,123
What about Anna?

1247
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:34,741
She's been in her room for hours crying.

1248
01:11:34,742 --> 01:11:37,898
She won't tell me anything.
I phoned Sylvio.

1249
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:39,327
She won't talk to him.

1250
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:42,993
She won't eat. I took her up a tray
she wouldn't even touch it.

1251
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:46,671
What's wrong with Anna, Joe?

1252
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,867
Does it have anything to do with you?

1253
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:52,140
I don't know, Mamma. I gotta hurry.
I gotta get to the store.

1254
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:55,121
My house is full of unhappiness, Joe.

1255
01:11:55,322 --> 01:11:56,858
Joe!

1256
01:12:33,056 --> 01:12:34,283
Joe.

1257
01:12:34,357 --> 01:12:35,721
Joe, I've got to talk to you.

1258
01:12:35,724 --> 01:12:38,266
Not now, Anna.
It has to be now.

1259
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,198
It can't wait, Joe.

1260
01:12:43,766 --> 01:12:45,408
What are you doing with that gun?

1261
01:12:45,415 --> 01:12:46,834
You shouldn't have come in here, Anna.

1262
01:12:46,841 --> 01:12:49,086
What's that for?
It doesn't concern you.

1263
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,105
Where are you going?
I'm going to the store. I'm working...

1264
01:12:51,111 --> 01:12:53,464
You don't need a gun in the store.
Joe, listen.

1265
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:55,766
Let me go!
Whatever is wrong, maybe we can work it out.

1266
01:12:55,791 --> 01:12:57,173
Please, don't make it worse.

1267
01:12:57,181 --> 01:13:00,326
If we have to, we can go away.
I'll do anything.

1268
01:13:00,336 --> 01:13:03,184
Joe, I love you.

1269
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:05,472
Nothing else matters.

1270
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:09,768
I might have to ask you
to remember that, Anna.

1271
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,327
Joe!

1272
01:13:40,908 --> 01:13:42,980
Come on in.
I've been waiting for you.

1273
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:51,548
Why are you closed?
I don't want anyone else around.

1274
01:13:55,962 --> 01:13:57,392
What are you doing to Anna?

1275
01:14:02,964 --> 01:14:04,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

1276
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,425
She just called me.

1277
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:09,223
She's almost out of her mind
worrying about you.

1278
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:12,190
What did she say, Sylvio?

1279
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:14,970
She told me you used to be a cop.

1280
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:18,419
You got in some kind of trouble
now you're going to make it worse.

1281
01:14:18,429 --> 01:14:20,269
You're carrying a gun.

1282
01:14:20,568 --> 01:14:22,102
Why?

1283
01:14:23,367 --> 01:14:24,674
It's none of your business.

1284
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,350
Anything that hurts Anna is my business.

1285
01:14:30,705 --> 01:14:31,989
Give me that gun.

1286
01:14:32,007 --> 01:14:33,062
No.

1287
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:35,789
I'm gonna meet a man at 12:30.
I'm gonna need it.

1288
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,989
Why?

1289
01:14:38,826 --> 01:14:40,534
I'm gonna kill him.

1290
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:43,978
You're crazy, Joe.

1291
01:14:43,987 --> 01:14:46,077
If I don't kill him,
he could put me in the gas chamber.

1292
01:14:46,097 --> 01:14:47,786
Im not gonna take any chances.

1293
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:50,774
Joe.

1294
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:55,579
Come here, Joe.

1295
01:15:04,957 --> 01:15:06,300
Pull up a chair.

1296
01:15:12,436 --> 01:15:13,731
Sit down.

1297
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:19,196
Now look, Joe.

1298
01:15:19,204 --> 01:15:22,436
Last night I told Anna not to interfere.

1299
01:15:22,446 --> 01:15:25,769
To let you work out your own problems
by yourself.

1300
01:15:25,873 --> 01:15:27,676
I was wrong.

1301
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:30,826
My family is being torn apart.

1302
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,094
I can't let that happen, Joe.

1303
01:15:33,216 --> 01:15:35,307
You've gotta tell me what it is.

1304
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,853
What have you done?
I haven't done anything.

1305
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:41,047
I don't expect anybody to believe me.
I'll believe you...

1306
01:15:41,075 --> 01:15:43,406
It's not enough, Sylvio.
Everything is stacked against me.

1307
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:45,488
It's my own fault too.

1308
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:46,929
You wanna know why?

1309
01:15:46,938 --> 01:15:48,463
Because I talk too much.

1310
01:15:48,478 --> 01:15:50,675
That's the reason
the cops dragged me in for questioning.

1311
01:15:50,682 --> 01:15:53,261
They got a motive.
But they can't prove I was in town.

1312
01:15:53,267 --> 01:15:57,084
The guy I'm gonna meet tonight
not only can put me in town but at the parish

1313
01:15:57,099 --> 01:15:58,675
a half hour before it happened.

1314
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:01,874
Before what happened?

1315
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,146
They think I killed Father Tomasino.

1316
01:16:07,216 --> 01:16:08,558
They're crazy.

1317
01:16:08,574 --> 01:16:11,932
You said you were in a hotel room
in Santa Rosa.

1318
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,015
Well I wasn't

1319
01:16:13,071 --> 01:16:15,756
One of the bellhops was driving into town
so he gave me a lift.

1320
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:17,454
He left me off at the parish house.

1321
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:19,639
Instead of going in I went for a walk.

1322
01:16:19,645 --> 01:16:21,426
Only I can't prove it.

1323
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:22,785
Why should you have to?

1324
01:16:22,808 --> 01:16:25,263
Do they know how much Father Tomasino
meant to you?

1325
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:29,300
Sure, but the only important thing to them
is that I had a big argument with Father Tomasino

1326
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:30,942
about being kicked off the Force.

1327
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:34,607
If that bellhop goes to the cops I'm through.

1328
01:16:34,612 --> 01:16:36,924
He wants a thousand dollars
to keep his mouth shut.

1329
01:16:36,935 --> 01:16:38,882
He expects me to give it to him tonight.

1330
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:41,010
Pay him, Joe.

1331
01:16:41,019 --> 01:16:42,044
Pay him.
No.

1332
01:16:42,061 --> 01:16:44,861
I'll give you the money.
No, Sylvio. In a few more weeks...

1333
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:46,455
he'll want another thousand, then another.

1334
01:16:46,491 --> 01:16:48,730
I'll be paying for the rest of my life.

1335
01:16:51,144 --> 01:16:52,688
I'm gonna meet him on the pier.

1336
01:16:52,703 --> 01:16:54,804
Nobody will be around that late.

1337
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,167
The body will float out to sea.

1338
01:16:58,957 --> 01:17:01,806
Even if they do find it,
nobody can pin it on me.

1339
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,458
You can't do it, Joe.

1340
01:17:13,703 --> 01:17:15,525
You can't do it.

1341
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:19,345
Even if you get away with it,
you can't do it.

1342
01:17:21,289 --> 01:17:23,292
It will always be on your mind.

1343
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:25,852
You can't get rid of it.

1344
01:17:27,307 --> 01:17:29,225
You can't sleep.

1345
01:17:29,237 --> 01:17:32,518
All night you wait for mornings
you can stop being alone.

1346
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,373
Sometimes you act like a clown.

1347
01:17:36,536 --> 01:17:38,445
You laugh when there's nothing to laugh at.

1348
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:42,824
You gotta have people around
so you that don't have a chance to think.

1349
01:17:44,568 --> 01:17:47,109
But you can't stop thinking
because it's inside of your brain

1350
01:17:47,113 --> 01:17:48,782
and you can't tear it out.

1351
01:17:48,795 --> 01:17:50,849
I know, Joe.

1352
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,562
I know.

1353
01:17:54,597 --> 01:17:56,016
What do you know?

1354
01:17:56,029 --> 01:17:59,184
The only problem you ever had is whether
the salmon are gonna run.

1355
01:18:13,674 --> 01:18:15,151
I killed somebody.

1356
01:18:15,181 --> 01:18:17,569
That's how I know.

1357
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:19,433
Who?

1358
01:18:19,637 --> 01:18:21,815
Angelina Poletti.

1359
01:18:22,022 --> 01:18:25,483
A girl in Naples during the war.

1360
01:18:26,742 --> 01:18:29,283
She was going to run away with another man.

1361
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:32,410
I went crazy.

1362
01:18:34,093 --> 01:18:36,538
She was found dead after a bombing raid.

1363
01:18:37,919 --> 01:18:40,115
They never knew how she died.

1364
01:18:41,753 --> 01:18:43,604
Nobody never knew.

1365
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:46,839
Nobody, Sylvio?

1366
01:18:47,042 --> 01:18:48,605
Nobody.

1367
01:18:50,534 --> 01:18:52,615
Didn't you confess to your priest?

1368
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:55,224
Didn't you tell Father Tomasino?

1369
01:19:01,748 --> 01:19:03,542
What are you trying to make me say?

1370
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:04,758
You just said it.

1371
01:19:07,608 --> 01:19:12,059
The only argument I had left
was that you had no reason to kill Father Tomasimo.

1372
01:19:13,413 --> 01:19:14,897
Now you just gave it to me.

1373
01:19:16,643 --> 01:19:18,465
So...

1374
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:23,478
everything you said tonight was a lie, eh?

1375
01:19:25,212 --> 01:19:27,364
Everything you ever said was a lie.

1376
01:19:27,572 --> 01:19:29,270
You're a cop.

1377
01:19:29,275 --> 01:19:31,020
That's why you came here.

1378
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,101
Pretended to be my friend.

1379
01:19:33,107 --> 01:19:35,208
Moved into my house.

1380
01:19:35,217 --> 01:19:37,998
You made love to Anna,
even asked her to marry you

1381
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:39,505
just so that you could get at me, didn't you?

1382
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:43,220
I have lived in hell for years
just to keep my family from being hurt.

1383
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,799
But you don't care what happens to them, do you?

1384
01:19:45,809 --> 01:19:47,707
Damn you! I'll kill you!

1385
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:52,136
In God's name.

1386
01:19:52,315 --> 01:19:54,780
I'd give my life to make them happy.

1387
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,507
On my life.

1388
01:19:56,517 --> 01:19:57,927
On my life.

1389
01:20:44,929 --> 01:20:46,531
Is that the knife you used...

1390
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:49,054
when you killed Father Tomasino?

1391
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:05,697
Sylvio.

1392
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:07,751
Sylvio.

1393
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,058
Sylvio.

1394
01:21:17,014 --> 01:21:18,178
It wasn't my fault.

1395
01:21:18,183 --> 01:21:19,909
He didn't look where he was going.

1396
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,319
I didn't have a chance to stop.
You saw it. You know it wasn't my fault.

1397
01:21:23,327 --> 01:21:24,727
Somebody get an ambulance.

1398
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:36,503
Father.

1399
01:21:36,506 --> 01:21:40,611
Wait. He wanted to talk to Anna and Joe alone.

1400
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,260
I think you better go in now.

1401
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:48,900
Father Giuseppe.

1402
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:54,043
Anna.

1403
01:21:54,054 --> 01:21:55,416
You trust him.

1404
01:21:55,421 --> 01:21:58,901
Don't make big things out of nothing, Anna.

1405
01:22:00,058 --> 01:22:02,832
Joe has no more problems now.

1406
01:22:04,004 --> 01:22:06,095
We've straightened everything out.

1407
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:08,758
Didn't we, Joe?

1408
01:22:10,975 --> 01:22:12,749
He's a good boy.

1409
01:22:13,518 --> 01:22:15,802
He's gonna take care of you.

1410
01:22:15,822 --> 01:22:17,730
And mamma.

1411
01:22:19,088 --> 01:22:20,546
And Pietro.

1412
01:22:22,377 --> 01:22:23,527
Hey, Joe.

1413
01:22:24,586 --> 01:22:27,177
If you have to wallop Pietro

1414
01:22:27,724 --> 01:22:29,853
It's okay with me.

1415
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:33,356
You're the boss now.

1416
01:22:34,232 --> 01:22:35,661
Okay, Joe?

1417
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:38,013
Go, now.

1418
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:42,923
Baby.

1419
01:22:44,601 --> 01:22:46,221
My baby.

1420
01:22:46,612 --> 01:22:47,954
Joe.

1421
01:22:50,555 --> 01:22:52,712
Joe will be right out.

1422
01:23:00,971 --> 01:23:02,092
Joe.

1423
01:23:04,686 --> 01:23:07,351
Father Tomasino told me to go to the police.

1424
01:23:08,521 --> 01:23:10,036
But I didn't.

1425
01:23:11,795 --> 01:23:13,080
I couldn't.

1426
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:16,901
I couldn't hurt mamma and Anna, Joe.

1427
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:19,899
You know...

1428
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,867
wherever I went I saw his eyes.

1429
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,368
They were gentle.

1430
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:27,770
But they knew.

1431
01:23:29,415 --> 01:23:31,947
It kept getting worse and worse.

1432
01:23:33,106 --> 01:23:35,523
Then I saw his eyes all the time.

1433
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:38,780
I couldn't stand it, Joe.

1434
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:40,611
Sylvio...

1435
01:23:41,386 --> 01:23:43,583
I had to do it, Joe.

1436
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:47,592
I had to do it.

1437
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:52,590
Joe.

1438
01:23:54,293 --> 01:23:57,008
Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?

1439
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,866
Sure, Sylvio, sure.

1440
01:24:01,508 --> 01:24:03,109
Thank you, Joe.

1441
01:24:05,837 --> 01:24:07,228
Thank you, Joe.

1442
01:24:39,182 --> 01:24:40,419
Joe.

1443
01:24:43,081 --> 01:24:44,040
Well?

1444
01:24:48,809 --> 01:24:50,535
The accident beat me to it.

1445
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,898
I didn't find out a thing.
