1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


2
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,700
Father Tomasino

3
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,333
Is the Chief gonna see us or not?
Not right now

4
00:01:47,446 --> 00:01:51,446
He'll give you a break, he always does.
Sit down.

5
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,920
Did you call in to report
that you were going off duty?

6
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,560
I was upstairs when I heard Lt. Kilrain
is in with the Chief. I gotta talk to him.

7
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,407
Look, I know how you feel, kid.

8
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,764
And maybe you got a little more reason.

9
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:09,484
But there's not a man in this Department
that don't want to help bring in the priest's killer.

10
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:12,572
You're not ready for this sort of thing.

11
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,590
If you think I'm gonna ride around on a bike...

12
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:16,954
What have you got for us, Kilrain?

13
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,878
Summer will brief you upstairs.

14
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:25,246
We'll talk about it upstairs.

15
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,238
Lt. Kilrain?

16
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:31,255
Yeah?

17
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:33,887
I'm Joe Martini.

18
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,537
So?

19
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,630
I wanted to talk to you about Father Tomasino.

20
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,345
You got something for me?

21
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:46,546
No, sir.
I just wanted to know what happened.

22
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,359
He was a close friend of the priest's.

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,560
The Father got him his job here.

24
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:53,106
There's not much to tell, son.

25
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:57,646
Someone phoned him at the parish house last night

26
00:02:57,787 --> 00:03:00,087
and said they had to see Father Tomasino right away.

27
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:01,733
He went.

28
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:04,506
Whoever it was called him wouldn't let him go back.

29
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,804
Have you got any leads working for you?

30
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,622
Would I be standing here?

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,300
No. So far we got big fat nothings.

32
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,244
I wanna help.

33
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:19,376
It's Homicide's baby, now.
Nothing you can do that we're not doing.

34
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,489
You can use me. Transfer me to Homicide.

35
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:26,247
Look, Martini. My desk is loaded with telegrams.
The switchboard's jammed with calls.

36
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,648
Everybody in North Beach wants to help to find the guy
who killed the priest.

37
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,507
He was more than just a priest to me.

38
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:34,203
That's why you'd be in the way.

39
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,301
Send him back to traffic where he belongs.

40
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:37,503
Joe.

41
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:43,107
Why don't you take a couple of days off?

42
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,003
I'll square it with your captain.

43
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,803
Hey, Joe, you oughta see
that inside curve you showed me.

44
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,103
Why don't you come down and take a look?

45
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,111
Did you get off duty to watch us practice, Joe?

46
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,605
What about father Tomasino?
Is he coming too?

47
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,835
Not today, boys.

48
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,615
Hey, Joe. You wanna play baseball?

49
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,714
Boys, boys!
Listen to the sister.

50
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,724
Back to the field.
All of you play ball.

51
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,000
See you later.

52
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,002
Hello, Joe. Go on, now.
See you later, Joe. Bye.

53
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:31,125
Mother?

54
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:33,411
I haven't told them, Joe.

55
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,707
How do I tell them?

56
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:37,027
Why?

57
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:39,106
Why did it happen?

58
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,161
How could God let a thing like this happen?

59
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:46,225
Death is in the pattern of life, Joe.
As is birth, which no one questions.

60
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,452
I'm questioning it, Mother Catherine. Why?

61
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,029
I know how much Father Tomasino meant to you...
No you don't. You couldn't.

62
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:57,995
Ever since I can remember he's been...
I was here when he brought you.

63
00:04:58,176 --> 00:04:59,970
You were six years old.

64
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:03,219
A frightened little boy who had just lost his parents
and was all alone.

65
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:04,643
Except for him.

66
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,200
He was my family.

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,770
If he would have died in his sleep or been hit by a car
it would be hard enough.

68
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,911
But to be stabbed in the back in an alley.

69
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,860
I don't understand Mother Catherine.

70
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:20,052
I'm struggling with it too.

71
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,777
Come, let us pray for Father Tomasino.

72
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,329
The way he lived his life
he doesn't need my prayers.

73
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:26,416
Then pray for the one who took his life.

74
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:31,323
Joe, don't leave this place
with hate in your soul.

75
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,891
Goodbye, Mother.

76
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,608
Father, we've tried to keep out
of your hair up till now.

77
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,045
And we've appreciated it.

78
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,369
But we're up against a blank wall.

79
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:05,911
Until we come up with a motive
there's nothing much we can do.

80
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:12,306
Now, you were Father Tomasino's closest friend,
his assistant pastor.

81
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:15,127
There must have been somebody in the parish
who hated him.

82
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,434
I don't know how you can say that.
Everybody loved him.

83
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:20,751
Let's skip the emotion this time, Father.

84
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,100
Whether you like it or not...

85
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:26,432
Father Tomasino did have an enemy.

86
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:27,950
I refuse to believe that.

87
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,908
Then who killed him? A friend?

88
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,550
Yes, Gillen?

89
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:36,000
It's the Martini kid.

90
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:39,308
I sent out word I haven't got time.
I can't see him now.

91
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,006
That's why he asked me to bring him up.

92
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:42,608
Hello, Father.
Hello, Joe.

93
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:43,893
Shut the door.

94
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,870
Alright, son. What is it?

95
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:53,908
The other day when I wanted a transfer to Homicide
you asked me if I had anything.

96
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:56,343
Well, I think I've come across something.

97
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:57,525
What is it?

98
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,170
It's a man. Nothing definite.
You might even call it a hunch.

99
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:04,506
But at least it's something to start with.

100
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:06,890
I've done some checking around already.

101
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,300
Get to the point.

102
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,516
I saw him at the funeral.

103
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,333
He was going through hell.

104
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:16,029
He used to be a member of the parish.
His name is Sylvio Malatesta.

105
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,418
Do you know him, Father?

106
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:19,527
Of course.
Everybody in North Beach knows him.

107
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:23,025
And likes him.
Joe, you've made a terrible mistake.

108
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,300
Sylvio had a reverence for Father Tomasino.

109
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,703
It was almost a childlike adoration.

110
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,275
I'm telling you.
He was going through the tortures of the damned.

111
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,796
He was bleeding inside.
He was tearing his hands.

112
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:36,218
Dozens of people are breaking up
over Father Tomasino.

113
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:40,117
We can't go around arresting people
just because of the expressions on their faces.

114
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,200
It was more than just the expression.
Alright, it was suffering.

115
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:45,294
What would he have said if he'd seen your face?

116
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:48,723
Well, I think it's worth checking.

117
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:51,164
We'll check hunches later.
Right now we're after facts.

118
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:54,595
Facts? The facts are you got nothing
and you're getting no place.

119
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:57,993
Get him out of here Gillen. If I see him around here again
I'll have his job.

120
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,071
Now, Father, let's go over this again.

121
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,505
Give it up, will you, Joe?

122
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,439
You've been on a run since it happened.

123
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,650
I covered you with your captain.

124
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:14,715
But the funeral is over.
I'm fresh out of excuses.

125
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:16,906
You won't need them any more.

126
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:20,007
What are you doing?
I just can't sit around doing nothing.

127
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:22,756
Joe, you know what you're doing?
Reinstatement ain't easy.

128
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,804
I saw Malatesta's face.

129
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,039
You didn't.

130
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,366
Well, say something.

131
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,760
Nice little crabs.

132
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,100
Little crabs?
Ei, Grazzioli...

133
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:04,338
tell him the only time he has ever seen a bigger crab
is when one of mine walks into his store.

134
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:08,872
He says the only time...
I heard him, I heard him.

135
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,676
The trouble with you, Antonio,
is you won't take your boat near the rocks.

136
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:14,075
The ones you catch haven't learned
to crawl yet.

137
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:19,590
Alright big mouth, I bet I got a bigger crab in my store
than you got right here.

138
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,402
Ten dollars. You take'em?

139
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,900
No. I already saw your wife walk in.

140
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,006
Sylvio Malatesta?

141
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,536
Yeah.
I'm Joe Martini.

142
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,900
What can I do for you?

143
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,806
You don't know the name?
No, should I?

144
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,230
I guess he didn't get a chance to talk to you about it before.

145
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:07,555
So forget it.

146
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,540
Who didn't have a chance to talk to me?

147
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:11,792
A friend of mine.

148
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:14,424
I'm looking for a job.
He said he was going to talk to you.

149
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,030
Maybe you could find something for me.

150
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,503
Yeah? Who is it?

151
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,200
Father Tomasino.

152
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:25,297
You knew him, didn't you?

153
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,808
Father Tomasino?
Sure.

154
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:31,261
He was a true saint of a man.

155
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:35,228
His death left a big emptiness inside of us.

156
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:38,546
Have you done any fishing before?

157
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,417
I worked a squid boat out of Monterey.

158
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:42,904
But that was a couple of years ago.

159
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:45,612
I wish I could do something for you.

160
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:49,708
But things are pretty slow right now.
Maybe when the salmon start to run again.

161
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,110
Yeah, I know.

162
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,452
How much do I owe you?

163
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:00,478
Not a thing. On the house.

164
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,558
No, no, I want to pay for the...
Forget it.

165
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,275
Thanks.

166
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,606
Say. I'll check with some of the other boys.

167
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:10,422
If there is something,
where can I get in touch with you?

168
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:11,902
I haven't got a place yet.

169
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,503
It's the first time I've been in town
that Father Tomasino didn't set things up for me.

170
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,468
You know, it's funny...

171
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,672
not being able to get together with him.

172
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,383
Kinda lonely.

173
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:26,639
Thanks anyway.

174
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:27,858
Hey!

175
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:32,765
Hey!

176
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:39,726
Why don't you come to my house
for dinner tonight, eh?

177
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:43,632
I couldn't do that, Sylvio.
But thanks...

178
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,905
Aw, come on. Meet the family.

179
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,830
Maybe we can talk about a job for you.

180
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:50,495
I don't want you to go to any trouble.

181
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,783
It's no trouble.
You be here at five.

182
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,908
That's the time I leave.

183
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:58,144
I'll take you home. Give you a nice dinner.

184
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,008
You can use it.
Ok, Sylvio.

185
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:03,308
Thanks.

186
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:08,712
Let's say I'm doing it for Father Tomasino.

187
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:12,400
He would want me to do something
for one of his boys.

188
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:16,607
Ok, Sylvio. I'll see you around five.
Sure.

189
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,436
Here, here. Don't you know stealing is a sin?

190
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,109
Don't you know stealing is a sin?

191
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,503
You want anything, you ask for it.

192
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,575
Here...
Wait a minute.

193
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,182
For you.

194
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,408
For your brother.

195
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,435
Go on.

196
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,300
There is my house, Joe.

197
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,195
Come on, Joe. I'll show you.

198
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,455
You got a free hand.
Give a whistle.

199
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,539
Mamma!
Watch out, Joe. Don't slip on the pasta.

200
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,051
Hey, mamma!

201
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:30,944
I'm home.

202
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,700
Now the whole neighborhood knows.

203
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,953
Put more water in the sauce.
I brought somebody for dinner.

204
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,519
One more, one less makes no difference.

205
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,216
Hey, mamma.

206
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,785
This is Joe.

207
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:43,514
Joe Martini. One of Father Tomasino's boys.
Hello.

208
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:44,757
Hello.

209
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,600
You're not the neighborhood boy?

210
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:49,916
I was up north. I just got into town.

211
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:52,005
Mamma, I got a present for you.

212
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,616
A present?
Yeah, wait till you see it.

213
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,004
A new frame for papa'a picture.

214
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,219
We don't need it.
But he hasn't got a frame.

215
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,833
Fix the old one.
I don't want it.

216
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,240
What are you talking about?

217
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,556
You don't even know how it's going to look.
Come on.

218
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:14,574
There's nothing wrong with the old frame.

219
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:17,605
They can't fix it anymore.
It's been mended too many times.

220
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,520
Come here. Look.
Look at this.

221
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,027
Come on, Joe.
There.

222
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,326
Isn't that nice? Stylish?

223
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:30,000
You spend too much money.
I know what's wrong with you.

224
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:34,327
You think the old one is old-fashioned.
You think everything in the house is old-fashioned.

225
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:37,590
Next thing I know you'll be taking off papa's moustache.

226
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,703
Hey, Joe.
Who's more of a man?

227
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,021
Papa or me?

228
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:47,168
You talk too much.
If you were half the man it would be enough.

229
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,593
I settle for 25%, Mamma.

230
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:53,090
All this fuss and you made me
forget the sauce.

231
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,903
Hey, Joe. Come on.
You gotta meet the rest of the family.

232
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:02,277
Hi.

233
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,904
My brother, Peanuts.
He thinks slow with a dirty word.

234
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:09,318
In regard to your letter of June 21st, comma,

235
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:12,234
our shipment of 70 dozen shirts

236
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,979
comma, style C-136,

237
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,650
thru F-420, comma

238
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,680
was dispatched on May 9th
according to your shipping instructions, period.

239
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:25,000
We're forwarding your letter to Mr. Smith
for further action, comma...

240
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:29,032
Stop that!
Now you see what you did.

241
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:31,503
I was up to "Mr. Smith" and now I've lost it.

242
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:34,409
Why do you talk so fast? Why?

243
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,210
Every day you come

244
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:44,067
My cousin, Anna.
She talks back to records.

245
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,707
Honey, this is Joe Martini.

246
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,510
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Martini.

247
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:53,017
Call him Joe. That's his name.
He's going to have dinner with us tonight.

248
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,135
That's nice.

249
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,938
Look at these chicken scratchings, Joe.

250
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:58,071
That's the way she wastes her time.

251
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,500
I ask you which is more waste?

252
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:03,927
Studying to be a secretary from the mail order school
or sitting around the house doing nothing?

253
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,023
Did we bring you from Italy to be a secretary?

254
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,447
No.

255
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,300
When her parents died we said
cousin Anna you come over here live with us.

256
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,600
We take good care of you.
Find you a nice husband.

257
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,300
Find me a husband.
Like finding bait for your fish.

258
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:20,462
I don't want a husband.
I want to work.

259
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,393
Work? For what?

260
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:24,614
No women in my family work.

261
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:26,516
They get married.
Hey, Joe.

262
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:30,538
Have you ever seen a prettier girl in San Francisco?

263
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:32,356
Never.

264
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,529
Now you say something nice about him.

265
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:37,807
Oh, stop it, Sylvio.
At least say that he hasn't got two heads.

266
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,560
Alright, Joe, you haven't got two heads.

267
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:42,391
Thank you.
I hope not.

268
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:45,587
There's enough water in the sauce now.

269
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,590
Go call your brother.
OK, mamma, OK.

270
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,379
I hope not...

271
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:54,907
Pietro!

272
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,830
Supper! Right now.
Not next week.

273
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,309
Why do you keep asking me
why I run the mile for, Mamma?

274
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:11,607
Because it's a mile race, that's why?

275
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:13,735
And I've got to win for Galileo next week.

276
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,616
Now, if those knuckleheads from college...

277
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,760
It's crazy. If you go some place, ok.
But you end up where you start.

278
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,865
Next year, Joe,
I'm going off with a two-mile.

279
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:25,712
The grocery store is a half a block away.
I can't even get him to walk.

280
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,800
Hey, you know something?

281
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,619
We broke a record tonight.

282
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:32,434
This is the first time we had
a young fellow to dinner...

283
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:34,453
that Anna doesn't hurry away from the table.

284
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:38,001
Hey, you're doing alright.
Remember that joker, Tony Malfi?

285
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:42,071
Sure. Hey, Joe.
This Tony Malfi, he got a scholarship to college...

286
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,827
played football for Notre Dame...

287
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,149
but halfway through the soup
Anna got a headache.

288
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:51,391
A real headache from his talk of blocking and tacking
and throwing to kick the football, ah!

289
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:54,314
How about Harry Boncelli?

290
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,904
His mamma and papa still don't talk to us.

291
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,690
She wouldn't even let him in the house.

292
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:02,207
That's the idiot who follows me in his car
when I walk down the street.

293
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:04,389
And he blows his horn at me.

294
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:11,500
It's always the same. She will rather stay home
than waste her time with an idiot.

295
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:13,117
I keep saying to her:

296
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,630
How are you going to know an idiot...

297
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,803
if you never give him a chance to prove it?

298
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,501
The minute they open their mouths
they prove it.

299
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,629
I just can't stand stupid talk.

300
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,900
Joe hasn't said a word since he sat down.

301
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:27,718
I noticed.

302
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,165
Hey, Joe.

303
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:32,107
From her that's a compliment.

304
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:34,691
Hallelujah. You're in like a burglar.

305
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:37,401
How'd you like to take her
to the Vallejo Social Club?

306
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:39,103
A week from Saturday.

307
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,517
I'd like to very much.

308
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:45,214
No, thank you. I'd rather not.

309
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:46,407
I really would.

310
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,325
Sorry Peanuts embarrassed you.
No, he didn't embarrass...

311
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,414
Anna!
I hope Sylvio won't.

312
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:54,963
I don't want to go to the dance.
She doesn't want to go to the dance.

313
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:56,614
But mamma insists she goes.

314
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:59,500
And who's stuck? Me. Always stuck.
Oh, Pietro!

315
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:01,462
If only she'd stop acting like a square.

316
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:03,556
Plenty of guys are willing to take her
off my hands.

317
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,920
But no, she won't dance with anyone else.

318
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,340
Dance? Since when is dancing
this crazy jumping?

319
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:12,668
She won't even go to a show
without me taking her.

320
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:16,000
I got my own life, you know.
My own girlfriends.

321
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:18,203
They're just begging me to take them out.

322
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,418
Now you see what you've done?

323
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:26,238
You are no better.

324
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:29,549
You take her to that dance
or you'll be running that mile with a broken leg.

325
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,915
Ok, ok.
Alright, alright!

326
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,430
That girl, she's got such a temper.

327
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:36,687
Who did she get it from?

328
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:42,116
Well, it was the little things.

329
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:46,221
Like the time Father Tomasino
gave me a concertina.

330
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:48,263
Mother Catherine said it was against the rules...

331
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,819
you know, for one kid to get a present
and the others don't, you understand.

332
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:52,753
Well...

333
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:56,300
He told her I had a gift for music.
What gift for music?

334
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:59,608
And he said that if I got the concertina
and played it for the other kids...

335
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:01,319
this way they would get a present too.

336
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:07,829
He was a man loved by everyone.

337
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,004
Not everyone.

338
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:16,569
Someone didn't.

339
00:21:21,102 --> 00:21:22,302
Hey, Sylvio.
Hm?

340
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,910
What did Joe hit in the best year?

341
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:28,518
Joe who?
The only one that matters in the whole world! DiMaggio!

342
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,837
Oh, Joe DiMaggio.

343
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:34,153
381, in 1939.

344
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,286
Pay up!

345
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,490
Hey, Joe DiMaggio.

346
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,805
I got it, I got it...

347
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,466
What a man, DiMaggio.

348
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:55,618
Who do you think did it?

349
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,535
Huh?

350
00:21:57,546 --> 00:22:00,006
Oh, I don't know, Joe.

351
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:02,718
Could have been anybody.

352
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:04,047
But why?

353
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,810
How can he live with it?

354
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:14,165
What does it do to his insides?
How does he eat, how does he sleep?

355
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,009
What kind of a man is he, Sylvio?

356
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:22,846
If the cops knew that, Joe,
they'd be able to catch him.

357
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,005
Yeah.

358
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:28,721
I could have been with him that night, you know.

359
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,005
Instead I was in Santa Rosa.
I could have been right here.

360
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:34,413
But I didn't want to spend the money for bus fare.

361
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:39,302
Do you ever find yourself thinking
about what you were doing that night?

362
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,941
Yeah. I was playing cards.

363
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:45,615
At home?
No, at the Vallejo Club.

364
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:48,000
We got a game there every Friday night.

365
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:54,208
I just can't get it out of my mind.

366
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:56,058
The way he died.

367
00:22:57,197 --> 00:22:58,437
In an alley.

368
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:00,411
You've got to stop thinking about it.

369
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,925
Maybe a job will help you.

370
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,758
More than a job,
what you need is a home.

371
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:11,222
Mamma likes you.
Anna likes you.

372
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:14,024
I like you, Joe.

373
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,960
We got an extra room. You move in and stay with us.
Oh, no, Sylvio.

374
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:19,508
I can't do that.
You come over. It's settled.

375
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:21,926
Tomorrow you pick me up.
Drop me off at the shop.

376
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,833
Take the car, get your stuff,
and you move in with us.

377
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:28,585
Hm?
Thanks, I'd like that.

378
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:32,497
I'm glad to be able to do it.

379
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:36,502
For Father Tomasino.

380
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:05,934
Hey, Joe!

381
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:12,705
Give him!

382
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:17,453
Oh, that's beautiful, Joe.

383
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:21,514
Hey, wait! What's the matter with you guys?
Trying to kill me or something?

384
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:25,872
Boom! I made it!

385
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,210
Sylvio, it's after 3 o'clock.

386
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,128
Would you like me to make you
a cup of chocolate?

387
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,819
I'm alright, honey.

388
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:15,502
Why don't you go back to bed?
Sometimes it helps you to sleep.

389
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:21,324
You're as bad as mamma.
Why don't you leave me alone?

390
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,569
I'm up anyway.
It will only take a minute.

391
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

392
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,801
What are you doing up?

393
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:17,332
Can't you sleep either?

394
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:20,006
I heard Sylvio.

395
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,713
I don't know how he does it.

396
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:27,800
Works all day long
and walks the floor half the night.

397
00:26:27,832 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm making him some chocolate.

398
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:32,000
You want some?
Yes, thanks.

399
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:36,290
How long has he been doing that?

400
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,538
Do you know what's bothering him?

401
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,717
He never talks about it.

402
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:44,123
But mamma and I know.

403
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:50,884
He's never gotten over Angelina Poletti,
a girl he met in Italy during the war.

404
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:55,305
They were very much in love
They were going to get married.

405
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:59,216
Then something happened and they didn't.

406
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:03,489
Whatever it was it hurt him very deeply.

407
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,690
This walking the floor,
it's been going on that long?

408
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:12,516
Mamma says
ever since he came home from the war.

409
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:17,925
I need some more milk, Joe.

410
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:27,324
I live with the man, I work with the man,
he treats me like a brother but I still haven't got a thing.

411
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:29,117
Kilrain is in the same boat.

412
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,100
He's no closer to the answer.

413
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,309
I thought I had him nailed though.

414
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:36,319
He doesn't sleep nights,
he walks the floor.

415
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:40,226
Then I find out he's been doing it for years.

416
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,218
Was he walking the night the priest was killed?

417
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:47,618
According to the coroner,
Father Tomasino was killed at 11 o'clock.

418
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:51,153
According to Malatesta he was playing cards
at a place called the Vallejo Club.

419
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:53,256
It's a regular game, every Friday night.

420
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,107
That shouldn't be to tough to check.
I haven't had a chance.

421
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:58,628
Last couple of Friday nights
he's been taking me to the fights.

422
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,679
He says he doesn't want me to blow my money
in a card game.

423
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:04,318
The more you tell me,
the more he sounds like a nice guy.

424
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:07,006
I'll tell you after I check his alibi.

425
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:08,925
You wanna know something?

426
00:28:10,382 --> 00:28:11,882
I hope it stands up.

427
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:14,707
You're getting a little mixed up, aren't you, kid?

428
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:19,821
Maybe, but I never had a home before.

429
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:23,572
Not until now.

430
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:37,573
Hey, Joe!
Excuse me.

431
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:41,315
Hey, Joe, I should have told you...

432
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:43,313
No use getting dressed.

433
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:45,323
Anna's not going to the dance with you.

434
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:49,128
Since when?
Since I was a comedian this afternoon.

435
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:51,000
She bought a new dress.

436
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:54,709
I had to open my big mouth and tease her
how excited she was about tonight.

437
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,614
Suddenly she made up her mind.

438
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:01,000
She said the only reason you are taking her
is because mamma and me want you to.

439
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:03,307
Oh, Sylvio.

440
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,726
I'll handle it.

441
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:07,255
Don't try it, Joe.

442
00:29:07,284 --> 00:29:08,784
She'll only get mad at you.

443
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:27,607
That was taken the day Father Tomasino
gave me the concertina.

444
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:30,036
About the dance, Joe. Forget it.

445
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:31,455
Pietro will take her.

446
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,778
You know, you're a great little fixer.
Thanks a lot.

447
00:29:41,652 --> 00:29:43,712
You're breaking my heart, Gillespie.

448
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:45,837
Five girls tonight and only you?

449
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:49,129
What? They've never been out
on a date before?

450
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:50,414
How old are they?

451
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:53,222
Sixteen?
Oh, I'm dying, I'm dying.

452
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:57,432
No, I told you I'm hooked with my cousin tonight.

453
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,110
Can I help it if she's an albatross
around my neck?

454
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:05,849
I told you I'm not going to go to the dance with you.
Or anyone else.

455
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:08,008
I heard you!

456
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:11,891
You ought to be ashamed!
You rascal!

457
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:13,406
Talking about like that about your cousin!

458
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:15,418
Hey, ma, what are you hitting me for?
I didn't do nothing.

459
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,008
Talking like that about your cousin!

460
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:18,701
Shame on you!
Hey, ma, come on.

461
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:19,805
Enough, it's alright.

462
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,504
What do you mean it's alright?
Nothing is alright.

463
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:23,691
What's happening?

464
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,920
What's going on?

465
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:27,712
I talked to a friend, that's all.
Right away it's for the United Nations.

466
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,992
What did he say?

467
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:32,135
It's alright. It doesn't make any difference
what he said.

468
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:34,531
I'm not going to go to the dance, period.

469
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:36,703
I'll stay home and study shorthand.

470
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:40,000
Will somebody please tell me what's going on?

471
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:41,917
If I can get a word in here, edgewise...

472
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,353
maybe I could straighten it out.

473
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:44,989
It is straightened out.

474
00:30:44,994 --> 00:30:47,214
Anna, Pietro will take you.

475
00:30:47,232 --> 00:30:52,402
In a million years. Two million.
I won't even go to the door with him.

476
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:53,614
Oh, you shut up!

477
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:56,571
Anna...

478
00:30:56,635 --> 00:31:00,835
Big deal.
Biggest deal in the world.

479
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,565
Where are you going?
Gonna eat a worm.

480
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:06,274
Pietro! Pietro, you come back here.

481
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:12,525
Joe, you are my friend. Will you please tell me
what's going on in my own house?

482
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:24,943
Anna.

483
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:27,494
I know how you feel.
It's none of your business.

484
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,506
Pleaso go to the dance with me tonight.
No!

485
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,510
But we had a date tonight.

486
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:34,912
At least tell me why you changed your mind.
Why are you sore at me for?

487
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:37,300
Because you are a jellyfish.

488
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,211
You don't want to take me to this dance.
Oh, yes I do...

489
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:43,159
Mamma pushes you.
Pietro pushes you. Sylvio pushes you.

490
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:45,418
They push you over a cliff if you don't say yes.

491
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,636
Nobody's pushing...
Take your hands off me.

492
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,160
I don't want anyone to have to be nice to me.

493
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,696
Cut it out, ma.
So it's hurting, eh?

494
00:31:54,719 --> 00:32:01,201
I'm not asking you for Sylvio,
for Pietro or mamma.

495
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:04,405
I'm asking for myself.
Will you please go to the dance with me?

496
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,656
I told you no.

497
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:10,004
Anna, you made a date tonight with me.
Not with one of your idiots.

498
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:11,624
And you're not going to stand me up.

499
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,215
Now, are you coming out
or am I coming in after you?

500
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:24,416
Anna, a locked door isn't gonna stop me.
I'm not fooling around anymore.

501
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:26,421
Come out here this very minute.

502
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,985
You know what's wrong with you?

503
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,100
Everybody babies you in this house.

504
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,417
Well I'm not about to.
Now come on out here!

505
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:39,402
Alright, you've had it. Step back, lady,
cause I'm coming through.

506
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:46,436
Joe. Do you like the new dress I bought?

507
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:50,595
You mean to tell me
you're going to the dance with me?

508
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:52,109
Of course.

509
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,429
Then why did you make me go through
this big deal of breaking through the door?

510
00:32:57,564 --> 00:33:01,364
I wanted to make sure that you wanted to take me.

511
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:05,497
Now I'm sure.
So please go. Let me finish.

512
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:11,298
Be downstairs in 10 minutes.

513
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,000
I'll be there in five.

514
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:22,335
Excuse me, mamma.
Joe, you're my boy.

515
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:23,889
You're my boy.

516
00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:27,073
Here, take the car.
Alright, good.

517
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:28,309
Here's some money...
No, no, no.

518
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,884
Anything you want, Joe.

519
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:34,806
Hi. You with anyone?
Mamma mia!

520
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,520
Joe. Joe!

521
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,919
No dancing in there.
I know, I was just stalling.

522
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:11,004
It's not that I don't like it.
But I'm just a coward when it comes to doing it.

523
00:34:11,024 --> 00:34:13,004
I'm glad. So am I.

524
00:34:13,023 --> 00:34:15,523
Let's grab a couple of chairs while we can.

525
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,472
Shall we?
This I think I can manage.

526
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:58,008
I'd almost forgotten people dance like this.

527
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:02,614
Every time I've been here with Pietro
I've limped home with a broken back.

528
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,909
You dance very well, Joe.

529
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,531
I usually have to apologize to everybody
in the floor.

530
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,566
I guess it's you.

531
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,318
Joe, thanks.

532
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:25,712
For what?

533
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,980
For making me come with you tonight.

534
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:29,333
It's a pleasure.

535
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:37,409
Well, they've just lost me again.

536
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:40,436
How about some punch?
You order it. I'll be right back.

537
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,330
Has Sylvio Malatesta been around tonight?

538
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:56,644
Friday's his night.

539
00:35:56,674 --> 00:35:59,674
Last couple of Fridays nights
we've been going to fights together.

540
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:02,245
Keeps beefing about missing his game.
I thought maybe I'd find him here.

541
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:03,805
Are you a friend of Sylvio's?

542
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,701
Yeah.

543
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:09,045
You wouldn't be Charlie Cuneo, would you?

544
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:10,496
No.

545
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:12,700
Good thing. If you were
maybe we'd throw you out.

546
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:16,049
Then I'm glad I'm not Charlie Cuneo.

547
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:18,211
Are you gonna be seeing Sylvio?

548
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:19,992
Oh, yeah. I see him all the time.

549
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:22,718
Tell him Vince De Paul
wants a chance to get his money back.

550
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,931
Cute fellow, Sylvio.

551
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:27,937
Last time he was here
he won six straight pots.

552
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:30,078
All of a sudden he looks at his watch...

553
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,890
says it's 9 o'clock and he's gotta meet
Charlie Cuneo to play snooker.

554
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,891
When was that?

555
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:39,116
Two weeks ago last night.

556
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:40,700
He hasn't been back since.

557
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,907
And he's walking around
with a pocketful of my money.

558
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,740
Come on, talk on your own time. Deal!

559
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:48,606
Most guys have their wives call up
when they're winning.

560
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:51,643
Sylvio has to invent a friend.

561
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:55,212
You tell him I don't think there is
a Charlie Cuneo.

562
00:36:57,623 --> 00:36:59,123
Yeah, I'll tell him.

563
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,880
Duty calls, baby. I'm yours.

564
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,566
No, thank you.

565
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:16,001
Be grateful,
I'm rescuing you from a lifetime of loneliness.

566
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:17,819
Get out of my way, please.
Shove off!

567
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,505
Still want some punch?

568
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:23,355
I'd rather dance.

569
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:30,415
Does anybody know
where there's an all-night monastery?

570
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:35,100
Who's the chick?

571
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:36,202
Anna Malatesta.

572
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,695
Lives on my block.

573
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:40,004
A real live living doll, eh?

574
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:44,621
Nice.

575
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,133
What's the trouble, Frankie?
She's a snob.

576
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:50,991
She don't wanna talk to anybody.

577
00:37:57,493 --> 00:38:00,393
Step down, pal.
This is a tag dance.

578
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:02,526
We're not buying.

579
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,817
Sorry, friend. It's the rules.

580
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:08,137
This is one big happy party.

581
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:10,659
Why don't we keep it that way, huh?

582
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,566
Let's get out of here.

583
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:21,724
Don't. That's Frankie Pellatrini. He's a prize fighter.
He'll kill you.

584
00:38:32,415 --> 00:38:34,405
Apologize to the lady, Frankie.

585
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:37,918
How about it, Frankie?

586
00:38:38,153 --> 00:38:39,553
I'm sorry.

587
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,200
She can't hear you.

588
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:44,005
I apologize. I apologize.

589
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,000
How about another waltz, fellas?

590
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:08,914
Hey!

591
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:10,816
How come the reception committee?

592
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:14,534
Ah, Anna's not home yet.

593
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:18,560
Look, mamma, it's almost 1 o'clock.

594
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,520
Good, I hope they don't come home all night.

595
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:24,158
Mamma!
Take your feet off the table.

596
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:28,321
You don't know, Pietro.
Your cousin, she is lonely.

597
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,526
Like Sylvio's lonely.

598
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:32,677
Enough there's one in the family.

599
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:35,399
Ah, leave me out of it, mamma.
You are sick with it.

600
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:37,214
No wife, no bambini.

601
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,900
I don't want your cousin she should be like that too.

602
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,026
Anna!

603
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,616
Did you have a good time?
Wonderful, thanks.

604
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:53,237
Where's Joe, honey?
He's trying to find a place to park.

605
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,410
Pietro, I love you!

606
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:01,312
You should have been there tonight.

607
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:06,035
Hey, Joe.

608
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,502
What happened to you?

609
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:11,622
It's nothing.
Did somebody slug you?

610
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:14,612
Joe, tell them what you did to Frankie Pellatrini.

611
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,744
Frankie Pellatrini?
Forget it.

612
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:20,039
Oh, no, what happened.
Frankie started trouble...

613
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:23,359
so Joe made him apologize to me
in front of the whole room.

614
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:27,613
No!
He made him get right down on his knees
and apologize.

615
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:29,507
Frankie Pellatrini, wow!

616
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:34,214
I ran into Vince de Paul tonight.

617
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:37,022
He told me about you walking out
on the last poker game.

618
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:39,572
He says he's waiting for you to come around
so he can get even.

619
00:40:39,574 --> 00:40:42,704
Ah, that pigeon.
He's lucky I left.

620
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:45,214
Another half an hour
and I would have owned his truck.

621
00:40:47,624 --> 00:40:48,994
See you in the morning.

622
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,754
What's the matter with him?

623
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:59,916
I don't know. He suddenly got quiet
on the way home.

624
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:02,505
I thought it was on account of the fight.

625
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:06,212
No, it wasn't the fight.

626
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,381
That boy's got trouble.

627
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:10,012
Big trouble.

628
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,800
Hey, what are you all dressed up for?

629
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:24,903
Something I gotta do.
Is it okay if I take a couple of hours off?

630
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,317
Sure. Anything wrong?

631
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:30,900
No. I'm just gonna see a guy in Chinatown.

632
00:41:30,995 --> 00:41:33,925
Ok. My turn to work tonight anyway.
See you at home.

633
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,449
Sure.

634
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:39,618
Alright, Joe. I'll check the name.

635
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:44,201
Frank? Gillen.

636
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,290
Give me a run on Charles Cuneo.

637
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:49,502
Wait a minute.

638
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:51,000
Any description, Joe?

639
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:53,704
No, Frank.

640
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:55,128
Right.

641
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:57,515
Who is Charles Cuneo, Joe?

642
00:41:57,587 --> 00:42:00,817
I found out Malatesta wasn't playing cards
at the club like he said.

643
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:02,806
He left around 9 o'clock.

644
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:06,416
Said he was gonna meet a fella named Charlie Cuneo
and they were gonna shoot some snooker.

645
00:42:06,488 --> 00:42:11,488
So far I haven't been able to find any Charlie Cuneo
and noone down here seems to know who he is.

646
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,770
Wait a minute, Joe.

647
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:14,379
Yeah, Frank.

648
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:16,447
No...

649
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,950
Alright, thanks.

650
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,591
Nothing on any Cuneo.

651
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:22,409
Did you check the phone book?

652
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:26,932
I did, and the City Directories.
I found seven Cuneos but no Charlie.

653
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,790
Check the utility companies and the motor vehicles.

654
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:33,802
If we don't come up with a Charles Cuneo,
Malatesta's got no alibi.

655
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,433
Right, Gillen. Bye.

656
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:51,618
Are you sure?
Sure I'm sure. I don't know any Charlie Cuneo.

657
00:42:58,638 --> 00:43:00,338
Well, that wraps it, buddy.

658
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:07,898
The game was for only one thing.

659
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:11,102
The other is for what you know
about Charlie Cuneo.

660
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:12,404
What makes you think I know anything?

661
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:14,922
You missed the setup
when I mentioned his name last night.

662
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:19,945
695 Clay Street, apartment 4C,
ask for for Veda.

663
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
Why Veda?

664
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,810
I do a little collecting for the bookies once in a while.
She likes the horses.

665
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:25,521
So do a lot of people.

666
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:28,338
Yeah, but they don't pay off
with checks signed by Charlie Cuneo.

667
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:31,031
Hey, buddy.

668
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:33,046
You didn't get it from me.

669
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:53,419
Yeah?

670
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:55,106
Veda?

671
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:57,711
That's right, honey.
What do you want?

672
00:43:57,745 --> 00:44:00,115
I'm looking for a Charlie Cuneo.

673
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,607
I don't know any Charlie Cuneo.

674
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,290
You play the horses, don't you?

675
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:07,257
Not me, mister. It's against the law.

676
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:08,681
Now get out of here.

677
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:14,225
Look. You gave one of our runners a check
you got from Charlie Cuneo...

678
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,760
it's bounced three times.
Now I wanna know where I can find him.

679
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:21,101
Ask his bank. I don't know who you are
and I don't know any Charlie Cuneo.

680
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,710
I'm not asking you for the money.
I'll willingly get that from Cuneo.

681
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:26,449
All I want to know from you
is where do I find him.

682
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:29,001
Veda what's going on out there?
Who are you talking to?

683
00:44:29,023 --> 00:44:31,323
A salesman, honey.

684
00:44:31,326 --> 00:44:32,726
I'm just getting rid of him.

685
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:36,519
You don't want a busted head, mister.
Get out of here.

686
00:44:36,582 --> 00:44:38,702
My husband works nights,
he needs to sleep.

687
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:41,704
Where do I find Charlie Cuneo?

688
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:42,714
Veda!

689
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:45,948
He's a married man.
I don't ask questions.

690
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:46,950
Veda!

691
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:49,966
Now beat it before you get the both of us killed.

692
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:07,518
Hey, Joe. How's my boy?

693
00:45:07,564 --> 00:45:08,564
Fine.

694
00:45:09,129 --> 00:45:11,629
What are you doing here at home?
I thought you were working tonight.

695
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:14,127
Pietro is there with Julio.

696
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:16,402
Did you see your friend?

697
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,522
Hm?
That guy in Chinatown.

698
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,800
Oh, no, I couldn't find him.
I bought mamma some leechee nuts.

699
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:26,929
Leechee nuts and lotteries.
She's crazy about them.

700
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:28,449
Mamma should have been Chinese.

701
00:45:28,465 --> 00:45:31,805
Hey, Joe, how come you were looking
for Charlie Cuneo?

702
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,141
How did you know?

703
00:45:36,288 --> 00:45:38,148
A customer told me.

704
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:40,961
Well, Charlie's an old friend of mine.

705
00:45:40,992 --> 00:45:42,702
Yeah?
Uh-hm.

706
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:44,700
No kidding.
Oh, yeah.

707
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,604
Come here.

708
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:52,932
They're always doing things like that.

709
00:45:52,973 --> 00:45:54,523
How's this for a surprise?

710
00:45:56,758 --> 00:45:58,358
Charlie Cuneo.

711
00:46:05,386 --> 00:46:09,186
Hey, what did you do to your hair?

712
00:46:09,194 --> 00:46:11,454
I washed it.

713
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,970
Anna, go see that everything is ready.

714
00:46:13,997 --> 00:46:15,957
Now that Joe's here we can eat.

715
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:25,595
Here, mamma. Take a leechee nut.

716
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,500
Oh, Joe, leechee nuts!
Hey, what's the matter with you two?

717
00:46:29,508 --> 00:46:32,208
You act as if you've never seen
each other before.

718
00:46:32,592 --> 00:46:36,152
The Charlie Cuneo I know is a tall skinny fella.

719
00:46:36,177 --> 00:46:40,507
But when I told you about Joe
you said you knew him.

720
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,410
Goodtime Charlie thinks he knows everybody.

721
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:47,083
After four beers nobody in a bar
is a stranger.

722
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:50,316
See, Rosa. There's another Charlie Cuneo.

723
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:53,277
He's the one's been doing all the things
she's blaming me for.

724
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,208
That would take six men.

725
00:46:55,214 --> 00:46:56,214
Very funny.

726
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:58,526
So you didn't know each other before.

727
00:46:58,586 --> 00:47:00,006
Now you do.

728
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:02,559
Well, what do you think of him?

729
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,316
This is Anna's Joe.

730
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:08,530
Nice to meet you Mr. Cuneo.
Call me Charlie.

731
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:11,122
The ball and chain here is Rosa.

732
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:13,742
Everybody to the table, eh?

733
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,420
What's the matter with you?

734
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:23,241
Big surprise, mamma.

735
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:25,127
Nobody's surprised but me.

736
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:27,044
Come on, Joe.

737
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:30,258
I'm gonna go wash up.

738
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:34,482
Joe.

739
00:47:35,738 --> 00:47:37,238
Joe, what's wrong?

740
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:39,544
Nothing, why?

741
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,470
I think there is.

742
00:47:41,465 --> 00:47:43,705
Do you really know a Charlie Cuneo?

743
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:47,406
Sure. He owes me $50,
that's why I was looking for him.

744
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,432
I watched your face when you came in.

745
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:54,063
I think you had more on your mind than $50.

746
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:56,294
What are you talking about?

747
00:47:56,911 --> 00:48:00,498
I just don't understand
the way you act sometimes.

748
00:48:00,508 --> 00:48:04,290
Everything is fine,
then all of a sudden you change...

749
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,300
like you were thinking of something
you wanted to forget.

750
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,317
Anna, Joe, dinner!

751
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,545
What is it? Can't you tell me?

752
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:14,108
Honey, there's nothing to tell.

753
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,725
Hi, everybody.

754
00:48:16,943 --> 00:48:18,543
You're late.

755
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:26,501
Very well. I have no right to pry
into your secrets.

756
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:28,822
They are waiting for us.

757
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:38,002
And they're still talking about it
in Petaluma.

758
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:41,422
Now get this picture.
I'm working off five straight strikes, see?

759
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:45,354
I take the ball and whamo!
A perfect shot.

760
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,220
So what happens? A seven/ten split.

761
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,830
I don't know whether to cry or to get mad.

762
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:53,608
So I get mad.
I take the ball again.

763
00:48:53,913 --> 00:48:57,513
Nobody ever threw a ball so hard.

764
00:48:58,487 --> 00:49:02,007
The ten pin hits the side of the alley,
bounces over to the seven pin

765
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:05,115
I get my spare and a 278 game.

766
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:07,118
Am I lying, Rosa?

767
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:09,928
How do I know?
I never get out of the house.

768
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:12,126
Do you bowl, Joe?

769
00:49:12,171 --> 00:49:15,471
No, no. I shoot pool.

770
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:18,636
Bowling is too expensive.
So is pool.

771
00:49:18,648 --> 00:49:20,148
If you play with me.

772
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:21,900
Here he goes again.

773
00:49:21,902 --> 00:49:23,700
I don't know why you always play with him.

774
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:26,677
All I ever hear is about how much money
he takes away from you.

775
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:30,007
Just once I'd like him to come home a loser.

776
00:49:30,015 --> 00:49:32,715
That'll be the day.
You know, Joe?

777
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:34,692
Sylvio is my private pigeon.

778
00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:37,719
Whenever business is bad on Saturday nights

779
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:40,508
I drive down from Petaluma
to play a little snooker with Sylvio.

780
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,050
Last time I come down I had to take him
out of a poker game to slaughter him.

781
00:49:44,074 --> 00:49:45,574
So I heard.

782
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:48,274
The fellas at the Vallejo Club
are a little hecked at Sylvio.

783
00:49:50,694 --> 00:49:52,804
But I thought that was Friday night.

784
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:58,830
Oh, sure. That's right. Saturday Rose's mother
was coming. I had to stay home.

785
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:01,818
So what does he do?
Sleeps all day.

786
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:05,762
Why?
Because he doesn't get to bed until 3 o'clock.

787
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:09,600
I was waiting for you to get to that.

788
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:11,300
Sylvio. Tell her.

789
00:50:11,315 --> 00:50:13,315
What time did I leave you?

790
00:50:14,664 --> 00:50:16,164
Oh, about 1 o'clock.

791
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,822
It was one twenty.

792
00:50:17,963 --> 00:50:20,900
Took me an hour and thirty minutes
to drive home.

793
00:50:20,914 --> 00:50:23,414
Ten minutes to get undressed.

794
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:27,554
Anna, you're a nice girl.
When you get married, please trust your husband...

795
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,620
don't keep track of every minute of his time.

796
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,500
A lot of reasons I got to trust you.
Please, Rosa, we're not home.

797
00:50:35,606 --> 00:50:38,106
We're all finished.
Let's go to the other room.

798
00:50:43,737 --> 00:50:46,800
Come on, Charlie. I got a beautiful
Bolla Galleano. I want you to try it.

799
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,410
It's going to be a lovely evening.
I've seen those two when they get started.

800
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:54,312
They're wonderful. Everything is wonderful.

801
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:57,696
Joe, you feel alright?
I've never felt better in my life.

802
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:03,996
I gotta go uptown. Keep the party going
and I'll be back as quickly as I can.

803
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:06,681
I've got something to celebrate tonight.

804
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:17,339
You know better than to bring me fried rice.

805
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:19,629
With my stomach it's got to be boiled.

806
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:26,348
Too much lousy whiskey, uh?

807
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:29,114
Too much lousy chow yuck.

808
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:31,621
And you did it to me.
You and your cooks.

809
00:51:31,654 --> 00:51:34,774
You miserable excuse for a Chinese
restaurant owner.

810
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:38,599
Hey, Joe.

811
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,101
What are you doing here?
I've been looking all over for you.

812
00:51:44,117 --> 00:51:45,990
I called the Hall and they said
you always eat here.

813
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:48,412
I've had the Chinatown beat for 20 years.

814
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:49,982
Now I'm a rice addict.

815
00:51:52,003 --> 00:51:53,063
What's on your mind?

816
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:56,807
I want you to put me on the reinstatement list.
I'm ready to go back to work.

817
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:59,001
You're pretty hard to keep up with, kid.

818
00:51:59,509 --> 00:52:02,199
I've still got a couple of  guys
trying to find that Charlie Cuneo for you.

819
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,202
He found me. And everything checks out
right down to the line.

820
00:52:05,226 --> 00:52:08,226
He was with Sylvio the night
Father Tomasino was killed.

821
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:10,172
They were playing snooker until after 1 o'clock.

822
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:12,206
Sylvio is as clean as a bird.

823
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:14,311
You sound mighty happy about it.

824
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:18,843
He loved Father Tomasino. He was grieving for him
as much as we all were.

825
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,800
On him it looked different.

826
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,340
You know, Kilrain was right.

827
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:24,646
A man isn't guilty by the look on his face.

828
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,850
And I spent an hour with Kilrain this morning
trying to convince him that he might be wrong.

829
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:31,195
Every lead we've had is going sour.

830
00:52:31,203 --> 00:52:32,803
Now this happens.

831
00:52:34,181 --> 00:52:36,331
I don't know what I would have done
if it had been Malatesta.

832
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:39,391
As much as I want to do something
for Father Tomasino.

833
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:42,906
The way it worked out
he's done something for you.

834
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:45,973
You said yourself you've never had a home.

835
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:48,106
Maybe this was his way of finding you one.

836
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:53,209
Well, I'll see what I can do about speeding up
your reinstatement.

837
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:54,217
How about a cup of tea?

838
00:52:54,377 --> 00:52:56,337
No, thanks. I gotta do some shopping
before the stores close.

839
00:52:56,343 --> 00:53:00,343
Do you know any place I can go
without being treated like a tourist?

840
00:53:00,364 --> 00:53:02,864
Sammy Yun. Right down the street.

841
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:03,969
Tell him I sent you.

842
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,030
You know what I'm gonna do for you
if this works out?

843
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,989
I'm gonna buy you a pair of chopsticks.

844
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:09,692
Gold-plated.

845
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:23,708
Where have you been?

846
00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:25,114
What's all that?

847
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:29,913
Where are the Cuneos?
Boy, you ducked out just in time.

848
00:53:29,938 --> 00:53:31,900
It turned into a first-class battle.

849
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:33,506
Our house wasn't big enough for them

850
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:35,769
so they went home
where they could have more room to fight.

851
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,111
Aw, that's fine.

852
00:53:37,182 --> 00:53:39,700
Well I got Charlie a couple of bottles of champagne.

853
00:53:39,725 --> 00:53:41,325
What are you buying wine for him?

854
00:53:41,372 --> 00:53:43,822
He loused up the whole evening.
Not for me, he didn't.

855
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,230
Tell you what. We'll save this one for Charlie
and we'll have the other one.

856
00:53:46,482 --> 00:53:49,422
Mamma, I got something for you.

857
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:55,619
A bag of leechee nuts.
I haven't touched the others yet.

858
00:53:57,137 --> 00:54:01,217
And another present for you.
Oh, my goodness.

859
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:03,707
What's in it?
Open it.

860
00:54:05,545 --> 00:54:06,915
Come on, come on.

861
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:14,257
Chinese pajamas?
Brocaded in solid gold thread.

862
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,920
The man at the store said the dragons
will never turn green.

863
00:54:16,946 --> 00:54:21,156
What am I gonna do with it?
You wear them when you eat the leechee nuts, silly.

864
00:54:23,763 --> 00:54:26,500
Don't I get something for it,
like a little kiss?

865
00:54:26,506 --> 00:54:29,106
Oh, sure, Joe.

866
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:31,301
Peanuts!
Is peanuts home yet?

867
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:33,649
Look what I got for peanuts.

868
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:38,119
It's a body-building set, You know,
for arms, the legs, the back and everything else.

869
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,286
Where's Anna?
Upstairs.

870
00:54:42,152 --> 00:54:43,552
Sylvio.

871
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:47,626
For Sylvio.

872
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:53,002
A fishing pole?
Oh, no, Joe.

873
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:55,235
You sure you didn't pick
the wrong package at the store?

874
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:56,857
You're a dope. It's a pool cue.

875
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:05,004
Best snooker player in San Francisco
helped me pick it out for you.

876
00:55:05,025 --> 00:55:08,005
If you can't beat Charlie with that
you might as well give up the game.

877
00:55:08,084 --> 00:55:11,524
Oh, Joe, it's beautiful.
I don't know what to say.

878
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:14,002
Just say you're my friend and shake my hand.

879
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:15,488
What for? We never fight.

880
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:17,116
Just shake my hand.

881
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:19,501
I don't understand, Joe, but you're my boy.

882
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:23,848
Excuse me.

883
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:28,909
Oh. Open the wine.
We'll be right down.

884
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:33,626
Whatever his trouble was, it's over now.

885
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:37,146
Just a second.

886
00:55:42,403 --> 00:55:43,603
For me?

887
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:44,809
Why?

888
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,505
Because I love you and want to marry you.

889
00:55:49,248 --> 00:55:51,198
Don't play games with me, Joe.

890
00:55:51,206 --> 00:55:52,606
I'm not playing any games with you.

891
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:53,933
I wanna marry you.

892
00:55:53,938 --> 00:55:57,538
What about the things that were bothering you?

893
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,622
The secrets you wouldn't talk about.

894
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:01,308
They're gone.

895
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:02,814
But you had them.

896
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:04,346
They're gone now.

897
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:07,800
How can I be sure?

898
00:56:10,122 --> 00:56:13,102
No, Joe. It has to be for real.
Not halfways.

899
00:56:13,518 --> 00:56:15,718
I need you, Anna.

900
00:56:15,768 --> 00:56:18,368
I need you very, very much.

901
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:27,769
Holy sweet Maria.
Hey, mamma!

902
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,170
Mamma, it's happened.

903
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:32,502
My little Anna.
My little Anna.

904
00:56:33,512 --> 00:56:35,612
We're gonna get married.
You're telling me?

905
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:38,922
I'm so happy I'm gonna cry.

906
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:44,473
Joe, I'm gonna throw you the biggest wedding
North Beach has ever seen.

907
00:56:44,474 --> 00:56:47,474
When do you want it?
Wait a minute. Don't rush it.

908
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,501
We haven't even had a chance
to talk about it.

909
00:56:49,518 --> 00:56:51,718
What is there to talk about?
I'll give you until next Sunday.

910
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:53,834
We have open house.
We tell everybody, eh?

911
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:56,321
Let's go downstairs.
We drink some champagne, yeah?

912
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:07,834
Hey, Sylvio. You only got two bottles.
You gonna run out pretty soon, you know that.

913
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:09,828
The Pacific Ocean will run dry first.

914
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,510
Everybody with an empty glass.
Bottoms up!

915
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:19,108
Let's drink up.
You want some wine?

916
00:57:22,217 --> 00:57:24,317
Ah, mamma.
No, no.

917
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,050
Anything wrong with the wine?
No, I had two glasses already. That's enough.

918
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:29,521
Come on, have another one.
No.

919
00:57:29,554 --> 00:57:32,404
Then maybe you put on your new Chinese pajamas
and show everybody.

920
00:57:34,516 --> 00:57:36,156
There, my mamma.

921
00:57:37,777 --> 00:57:40,677
Now only your daughter is left, Mrs. Bragiotto.

922
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:43,309
All she does is look at television.

923
00:57:43,314 --> 00:57:45,914
The only men she sees are selling soap.

924
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:49,400
I keep telling her.
You can win money on television...

925
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:54,414
have vacation, a mink coat, an automobile...
But a husband? No.

926
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:56,772
I guess she's going to be with me forever.

927
00:57:56,798 --> 00:57:59,328
Maybe you should break the television.

928
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:02,806
Right.
There's always hope.

929
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:06,009
Hey, Joey. Joey,
Yes?

930
00:58:06,011 --> 00:58:08,041
You and me gonna have a little talk.

931
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,360
I'm gonna teach you how to handle
your wife.

932
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,590
Is that right?
Sure. First you get a whip,

933
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:14,001
and then a chair.

934
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:16,568
And then you tell her who's the boss.

935
00:58:16,575 --> 00:58:19,515
And remember.
There's gotta be one boss to a house.

936
00:58:19,523 --> 00:58:22,923
When are you gonna tell me
who's the boss in our house?

937
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:27,197
Of course you gotta tell them slowly, nice, gently.

938
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,074
I've been married 22 years to my wife.

939
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:33,582
But some of these days...

940
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:37,121
Quiet everybody, quiet!
Everybody shut up.

941
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,109
I wanna make a toast.

942
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:43,713
To Joe Martini.

943
00:58:43,745 --> 00:58:46,345
My future cousin and partner.

944
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:49,548
Now wait a minute, Sylvio.
Another glass of wine and you'll give me the house.

945
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:52,251
What's the matter?
Don't you wanna be my partner?

946
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:53,875
Ok, I'll give you the store.

947
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,613
And the boat. You be the boss.
I work for you. Ok?

948
00:58:58,129 --> 00:59:01,629
To Joe and Anna.
And ten little bambini.

949
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:03,488
Bravo!

950
00:59:05,528 --> 00:59:07,318
Noisy, isn't it?

951
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:09,527
I never thought we had so many friends.

952
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,590
There isn't a soul in the house.

953
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:15,419
Hold it, Joe.
I wanna get a picture.

954
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,020
Hey, Raoul. Bring the camera.

955
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,930
You get outta there.

956
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:24,419
Yes, keep kissing.

957
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:28,606
Joe, there's some guy outside
wants to see you.

958
00:59:28,838 --> 00:59:30,118
Tell him I'll see him in a week.
Tell him to come in.

959
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:32,634
I can't. I'm on the phone.
Anyway, he says he's double-parked.

960
00:59:35,008 --> 00:59:37,578
Excuse me, boss.
I am the boss.

961
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:40,030
Anna, Anna...

962
00:59:41,573 --> 00:59:45,003
I'm telling you, Gillespie.
It's the second emancipation proclamation.

963
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:46,316
It's true, Gillespie.

964
00:59:46,361 --> 00:59:48,831
Why don't you come over and bring
some of those Sacred Heart girls?

965
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:52,147
Why not?
Everyone else in the neighborhood's here.

966
00:59:57,656 --> 01:00:00,456
So you finally showed, eh?
Get parked and come on up.

967
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:01,900
No, Joe.
It's gonna be alright.

968
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:03,501
But don't mention I was a cop.

969
01:00:03,597 --> 01:00:04,947
After we get upstairs,

970
01:00:04,954 --> 01:00:08,014
you and I will find a nice quiet corner
and then we'll decide how we're gonna break it.

971
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:09,712
Get in, Joe.
I gotta...

972
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:18,805
What's this all about, Gillen?

973
01:00:18,874 --> 01:00:21,590
This is Frank Wilkens.
He heads up a detective agency.

974
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:22,701
Hi.
Hi.

975
01:00:22,861 --> 01:00:24,261
Well, what did you wanna...

976
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,695
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta get back to the party.

977
01:00:26,701 --> 01:00:28,651
This is more important.
It'll only take a few minutes.

978
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:31,442
I brought Frank along and
thought maybe you'd like to talk to him.

979
01:00:31,737 --> 01:00:32,737
About what?

980
01:00:32,955 --> 01:00:34,405
Take a look.

981
01:00:34,488 --> 01:00:36,118
Filed yesterday.

982
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,706
It's a beating report.
Yes.

983
01:00:38,766 --> 01:00:41,466
The guy worked his wife over.
What's that got to do with me?

984
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,541
The guy's name is Albert Pinnelli.

985
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:47,846
Wife, Veda Pinelli.
I met her. She probably had it coming.

986
01:00:47,868 --> 01:00:49,008
She did.

987
01:00:49,017 --> 01:00:52,617
Pinnelli knew she was holding hands with somebody
and hired me to find out who it was.

988
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:54,962
Took a trip to Petaluma to get a name for him.

989
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:56,565
Charlie Cuneo.

990
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:57,687
You called it.

991
01:00:58,065 --> 01:01:00,815
When I spotted his name in Pinelli's statement
I got in touch with Frank.

992
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:04,129
The priest was killed Friday, May 11th.

993
01:01:04,133 --> 01:01:06,533
Wanna read the report yourself
or can I tell you?

994
01:01:06,587 --> 01:01:07,687
Which is quicker?

995
01:01:07,756 --> 01:01:10,566
It's a long report.
We gotta earn our fee.

996
01:01:10,578 --> 01:01:15,938
Frank tailed Veda to the Horizon club.
She got there at 9:17.

997
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,751
Charlie Cuneo and another guy
were sitting at the table waiting for her.

998
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:21,357
Frank checked, the other guy was Malatesta.

999
01:01:21,366 --> 01:01:23,866
At 9:50 Veda and Cuneo left.

1000
01:01:23,879 --> 01:01:26,409
They visited a half a dozen bars, they had drinks,
they danced.

1001
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,170
Cuneo made a couple of phone calls.

1002
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:31,068
At 12:57 they got back to the Horizon Club.

1003
01:01:31,073 --> 01:01:32,873
Malatesta was waiting for them.

1004
01:01:32,879 --> 01:01:34,779
Then he was there all the time.

1005
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,490
It could be.
But we were paid to tail the dame.

1006
01:01:38,502 --> 01:01:40,602
There's one thing for sure, Joe.

1007
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,359
Malatesta's been lying.

1008
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,490
First he lied about playing cards at the Vallejo Club.

1009
01:01:44,504 --> 01:01:47,404
Then he lied about playing snooker with Cuneo.
They both lied about that.

1010
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:51,474
All that proves is that Cuneo didn't want his wife
to know that he'd been running around

1011
01:01:51,485 --> 01:01:53,565
and he was using Malatesta to cover up for him.

1012
01:01:53,782 --> 01:01:56,062
Kilrain sees it the other way.

1013
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:59,048
Have you ever been to the Horizon Club, Joe?
No.

1014
01:01:59,722 --> 01:02:02,100
It's less than two blocks
from where the priest was killed.

1015
01:02:02,108 --> 01:02:04,288
The back door leads to the same alley.

1016
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:07,719
Aw, come on, Gillen. There must be a hundred doors
leading to the same alley.

1017
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:11,509
Kilrain talked about me grabbing at air.

1018
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,550
Nobody's grabbing at air.
We've got one thing to work on.

1019
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:16,591
Malatesta's alibi is out the window.

1020
01:02:16,592 --> 01:02:18,532
We'll take it step by step from there.

1021
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,000
Kilrain wants to see you tomorrow.

1022
01:02:24,002 --> 01:02:26,700
Want us to take you back?
No.

1023
01:02:26,714 --> 01:02:30,114
Let me off here.
I gotta do some thinking.

1024
01:02:51,145 --> 01:02:52,845
Hey, Joe.

1025
01:02:56,582 --> 01:02:57,912
Where have you been?

1026
01:02:57,967 --> 01:03:00,137
I've been looking for you all over the neighborhood.

1027
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:01,644
Thought I'd get some air.

1028
01:03:01,672 --> 01:03:03,372
The wine, eh?

1029
01:03:03,467 --> 01:03:09,500
Drunk on six little glasses of wine.
Ah, Joe, I gotta teach you how to handle that stuff.

1030
01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:12,306
Smart fella, though.
You didn't let Anna see you drunk.

1031
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:14,009
Plenty of time for that later.

1032
01:03:14,113 --> 01:03:15,813
You'd better not park there.
You'll get a ticket.

1033
01:03:27,348 --> 01:03:28,700
Joe.

1034
01:03:31,506 --> 01:03:33,006
Hello, Anna...

1035
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,200
I'm sorry I had to duck out,
but something came up.

1036
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:38,308
What, Joe?
What's wrong?

1037
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:41,385
I got some bad news about a friend.

1038
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:45,706
Who?

1039
01:03:47,852 --> 01:03:50,912
My head's coming apart.
Why don't we talk about it in the morning?

1040
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:54,227
Joe.

1041
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:57,673
They're back, aren't they?

1042
01:03:57,675 --> 01:04:01,115
What?
The troubles. You've got them again.

1043
01:04:01,154 --> 01:04:03,604
What is it? Can't you tell me?

1044
01:04:04,638 --> 01:04:07,038
It's something I have to work out for myself.

1045
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:09,036
Maybe if I knew I could help.

1046
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:10,607
Forget it.

1047
01:04:12,168 --> 01:04:13,908
We can call it all off, Joe.

1048
01:04:13,931 --> 01:04:16,431
What are you talking about?
I won't hold you to it.

1049
01:04:16,483 --> 01:04:18,013
You don't have to marry me.

1050
01:04:21,126 --> 01:04:23,226
You're right back the way you were.

1051
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:27,027
I knew you would be
when you stayed away so long.

1052
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:31,335
I've been going crazy thinking about it.

1053
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:36,877
Joe, would it make it easier
if we don't get married?

1054
01:04:36,898 --> 01:04:39,918
Anna, it's the one thing I'm trying to hold on to.

1055
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:42,022
Then you have to let me out.

1056
01:04:42,114 --> 01:04:46,414
I can't face life with you in peeks and drops
with no in-between.

1057
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,000
It's bad enough now.
I can't talk about it. You've gotta understand.

1058
01:04:51,015 --> 01:04:53,315
How can I? How can I?

1059
01:04:54,254 --> 01:04:57,114
You don't even tell me
what I'm supposed to understand.

1060
01:04:58,237 --> 01:05:01,437
One way or another it'll straighten itself out
in the next couple of days.

1061
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:04,666
I hope you understand that.

1062
01:05:09,286 --> 01:05:11,586
Joe. Joe.

1063
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:19,511
Let him alone, Anna.
Why, Sylvio?

1064
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:23,489
Sylvio.

1065
01:05:24,562 --> 01:05:28,112
Something terrible is gnawing at him.

1066
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:33,551
I've got to know.
I've got to find out what it is.

1067
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:35,798
Alright, honey, my baby.

1068
01:05:44,884 --> 01:05:46,404
Excuse me.
Yes?

1069
01:05:46,425 --> 01:05:49,525
I would like some information
about a boy who was raised here.

1070
01:05:49,591 --> 01:05:51,701
Mother Catherine would be the one to see.

1071
01:05:51,729 --> 01:05:52,929
She isn't in now.

1072
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:55,601
Who is it you wanted to ask about?

1073
01:05:55,633 --> 01:05:58,390
His name is Martini. Joe Martini.

1074
01:05:58,402 --> 01:05:59,992
Are you a friend of Joe's?

1075
01:06:00,062 --> 01:06:03,912
We are planning to get married.
You are?

1076
01:06:05,008 --> 01:06:07,728
Mother Catherine is not only going to be surprised.

1077
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:09,965
She's going to be hurt that Joe hasn't told her.

1078
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,330
As a matter of fact we haven't seen him in weeks.

1079
01:06:12,379 --> 01:06:15,119
Before that, was he coming here often?

1080
01:06:15,162 --> 01:06:16,862
At least a couple of times a week.

1081
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:18,900
He's a great favorite with the children.

1082
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:20,700
Especially when he's in uniform.

1083
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:23,105
Uniform?

1084
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:24,636
His police uniform.

1085
01:06:24,673 --> 01:06:28,973
When he walks through the door
even the toughest little monsters quiet down.

1086
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,685
You have no idea how we've missed him.

1087
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:35,412
How long has Joe been a policeman?

1088
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:37,126
Ever since I've known him.

1089
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,044
I've been here a year.

1090
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,460
Joe is still on the Police Force, isn't he?

1091
01:06:45,762 --> 01:06:47,302
I don't know.

1092
01:06:53,002 --> 01:06:54,522
Oh, about five minutes ago.

1093
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:57,100
No.

1094
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:58,909
No, I can't look at it.

1095
01:06:59,033 --> 01:07:01,603
Will do. Bye.

1096
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:03,421
Yes, miss?

1097
01:07:03,543 --> 01:07:05,613
I'd like to see the Chief of Police, please.

1098
01:07:05,627 --> 01:07:08,217
I'm sorry, he's gone to City Hall.
He won't be back this afternoon.

1099
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:09,824
Can anyone else help you?

1100
01:07:09,878 --> 01:07:13,008
I'd like some information about a police officer.

1101
01:07:13,027 --> 01:07:15,107
His name?
Joe Martini.

1102
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:18,059
May I ask who you are?

1103
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:19,687
Anna Malatesta.

1104
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:23,107
I'm sorry. I can't give you any information
about Martini.

1105
01:07:23,175 --> 01:07:25,805
Can you tell me if he's still with the Department.

1106
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:28,329
We're not releasing anything about him.

1107
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,300
He's in some kind of trouble, isn't he?

1108
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,731
What is it? Why did he lose his job?

1109
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:38,419
I have a right to know.
I'm engaged to marry him.

1110
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:40,117
I'm sorry, miss.

1111
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:46,049
Who can I see? There must be somebody
with authority to tell me.

1112
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,700
I'm afraid not. We have strict orders.

1113
01:07:52,338 --> 01:07:54,338
Thank you.

1114
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,548
Lt. Kilrain?
Gillen.

1115
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:09,210
Martini get there?

1116
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:10,619
I'm coming up.

1117
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:17,345
Mrs. Pinelli, your husband isn't here.

1118
01:08:17,377 --> 01:08:20,777
Even if he was,
he knows you were with Cuneo that night.

1119
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,460
Now you got nothing to lose and you can help us
if you'll answer a few questions.

1120
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:26,600
What's to answer?

1121
01:08:26,614 --> 01:08:28,324
That private eye wrote it all up.

1122
01:08:28,331 --> 01:08:30,731
I've got this to show for it.

1123
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:33,935
Please try to remember.

1124
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:37,841
Exactly what happened after you met
Cuneo and Malatesta at the Horizon Club?

1125
01:08:37,856 --> 01:08:40,776
Remember? I'll never forget it.

1126
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,780
Some gag.

1127
01:08:42,797 --> 01:08:44,367
Collector for a book.

1128
01:08:44,382 --> 01:08:46,192
I should have pegged you for a cop.

1129
01:08:46,203 --> 01:08:47,903
He asked a question, Veda.

1130
01:08:48,706 --> 01:08:50,716
Well, the whole evening was a mess.

1131
01:08:50,731 --> 01:08:53,631
Always was before Charlie
came in from the club on Saturday nights.

1132
01:08:53,677 --> 01:08:56,400
He'd tell his wife he was coming in to play snooker
with Malatesta.

1133
01:08:56,406 --> 01:08:58,666
They'd play until about twelve.

1134
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:00,322
Then Charly'd come by to see me.

1135
01:09:04,008 --> 01:09:05,800
Who's watching the store?

1136
01:09:05,804 --> 01:09:09,000
If I'd known there was going to be this big an audience
I would have brought my baubles.

1137
01:09:09,159 --> 01:09:10,309
Go on.

1138
01:09:10,394 --> 01:09:13,544
Why was I a dope to see Charlie
on a Friday night?

1139
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:16,328
My husband works a split shift
and gets home by two.

1140
01:09:16,372 --> 01:09:19,112
Charlie was stubborn so I said okay.

1141
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:23,535
We made a date for 9 o'clock.
When I walked in he was with his pal Sylvio.

1142
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,559
Not a bad-looking guy.

1143
01:09:25,597 --> 01:09:27,637
First I was kinda glad Charlie brought him along.

1144
01:09:27,653 --> 01:09:30,213
What a clump he turned out to be.

1145
01:09:30,221 --> 01:09:33,061
He was beefing when I walked in
and kept on beefing.

1146
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:35,783
He didn't approve of Charlie
stepping out on his wife.

1147
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:38,106
And he was all teed off at being used as an alibi.

1148
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,335
Is that why you and Cuneo left him?

1149
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:43,000
It was either that
or bust a chair over his head.

1150
01:09:43,169 --> 01:09:45,349
Would I tell that clump off.

1151
01:09:45,362 --> 01:09:50,300
I asked if his life was so pure and lily-white
that he could go around telling other people what to do.

1152
01:09:50,313 --> 01:09:51,413
He sure took it big.

1153
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:53,113
I thought he was gonna slug me.

1154
01:09:53,127 --> 01:09:56,167
So I walked and Charlie went with me.

1155
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:59,466
Did Cuneo leave you at all
any time during the evening?

1156
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:01,291
No, only when he went to use the phone.

1157
01:10:01,302 --> 01:10:02,722
Who did he call?

1158
01:10:02,738 --> 01:10:05,298
He was trying to reach Sylvio
back at the Horizon Club.

1159
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:08,152
He was afraid the square
would get in touch with his wife.

1160
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:10,113
Did he talk to him?

1161
01:10:10,134 --> 01:10:11,434
No. He wasn't there.

1162
01:10:11,588 --> 01:10:13,311
Exactly what time was that?

1163
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:15,871
I was in no mood for exact time.

1164
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:17,041
Well, approximately.

1165
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:21,730
The first time about an hour after we left.
Maybe 10:30.

1166
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:24,147
Tried again an hour later 

1167
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:27,000
then around 1 o'clock
we went back to the club and he was there.

1168
01:10:27,563 --> 01:10:31,290
Are you sure he wasn't there all the time.
Maybe he just didn't want to answer the phone.

1169
01:10:31,295 --> 01:10:33,565
Charlie jumped him about that right away.

1170
01:10:33,582 --> 01:10:35,762
Sylvio said he went out for about an hour.

1171
01:10:35,788 --> 01:10:37,158
He wanted some air.

1172
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:39,774
And that's all he said for the rest of the night.

1173
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:42,605
Just sat there and stared at us.

1174
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:44,400
Gave me the creeps.

1175
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,257
I don't think the guy was in his right mind.

1176
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:51,054
That'll be all Mrs. Pinelli, thanks

1177
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:53,311
If there's anything more
we'll get in touch with you later.

1178
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:59,337
Before I go I'd like to set one thing straight.

1179
01:11:00,026 --> 01:11:03,036
Charly's a clod but he's a good spender.

1180
01:11:03,043 --> 01:11:05,223
Likes to dance, hold hands,

1181
01:11:05,271 --> 01:11:07,731
have somebody around to laugh at his lousy jokes.

1182
01:11:07,745 --> 01:11:09,600
But that's all there was between us.

1183
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:11,565
I wouldn't want you thinking
there was any more than that.

1184
01:11:11,593 --> 01:11:14,290
If you can sell that to your husband
I'll buy it too.

1185
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:28,343
Well, I guess that marks it in, son.
I'll take it from here.

1186
01:11:28,347 --> 01:11:30,387
No.
Let him.

1187
01:11:31,793 --> 01:11:33,400
It'll be easier on you.

1188
01:11:35,163 --> 01:11:37,123
Anna Malatesta just left my office.

1189
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,550
Somehow she found out you were a cop.

1190
01:11:39,582 --> 01:11:42,632
She thinks you're up to your neck in trouble
and that's how you lost your badge.

1191
01:11:42,654 --> 01:11:44,334
I couldn't tell her any different.

1192
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:49,103
Look, I know this is rough on you, son,
I wish it didn't have to be.

1193
01:11:50,212 --> 01:11:52,012
Where do we pick up Malatesta?

1194
01:11:52,026 --> 01:11:55,376
Lieutenant, you haven't got a motive.
A man doesn't kill without a reason.

1195
01:11:56,008 --> 01:11:57,778
Maybe he had one.

1196
01:11:58,599 --> 01:12:00,019
We just don't know it yet.

1197
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,420
Look, Martini...

1198
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:06,528
for weeks you've been on my hair
trying to blow the whistle on Malatesta.

1199
01:12:06,534 --> 01:12:07,834
We wouldn't buy it.

1200
01:12:08,009 --> 01:12:10,279
Now we're ready to
and you're on our hair again.

1201
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,990
Just where do you stand?

1202
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:16,375
Lieutenant, if Malatesta killed Father Tomasino
I'll walk him to the gas chamber myself.

1203
01:12:16,386 --> 01:12:20,586
But all we've got so far is the fact that he wasn't
at the Horizon Club for about an hour.

1204
01:12:20,594 --> 01:12:23,604
That still doesn't put the knife in his hand.
He could have been out for some air...

1205
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:24,956
he could have gone to the movies.

1206
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:27,157
But you pick him up now
and the papers will get it.

1207
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:29,390
I'm thinking of what it's gonna do to his family.

1208
01:12:30,004 --> 01:12:32,414
His mother, the kid brother, his cousin.

1209
01:12:32,429 --> 01:12:34,949
That's why I told you to stay out of it.

1210
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:37,319
I don't have to think about his family.
I can't.

1211
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:40,710
That's one of the things about this job
that makes it stink sometimes.

1212
01:12:40,974 --> 01:12:43,584
You threw a lot of maybes at me.

1213
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:46,600
Well the only answer to them is Malatesta.

1214
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:47,999
Pick him up, Summers.

1215
01:12:48,288 --> 01:12:50,928
Lieutenant, unless you get a confession
you've got no case.

1216
01:12:50,935 --> 01:12:52,475
And you're not gonna get any.

1217
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,840
I know him. I've talked to him about Father Tomasino
and he doesn't turn a hair.

1218
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:58,966
All he will tell you is that he loved the priest.

1219
01:12:58,976 --> 01:13:01,636
In 72 hours you're gonna have
to let him go again.

1220
01:13:01,642 --> 01:13:03,400
Well, isn't that what you want?

1221
01:13:03,403 --> 01:13:06,573
Maybe you can close the book on this case.
I can't. I've gotta know.

1222
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:09,317
I still have a chance with him.
You haven't.

1223
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:13,269
All I ask for is a couple of days.
You've had almost a month.

1224
01:13:13,278 --> 01:13:14,788
But I've got different cards now.

1225
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:17,410
If I play them right,
Malatesta will walk in here by himself.

1226
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,020
What can you lose?

1227
01:13:20,037 --> 01:13:22,227
It'll make it easier for all of us
if he can pull it off.

1228
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,936
I haven't heard anything yet
to make me think he can.

1229
01:13:25,646 --> 01:13:27,696
Anna thinks I'm jammed up in something.

1230
01:13:27,701 --> 01:13:30,300
I'm gonna keep working this angle
until it gets to Sylvio.

1231
01:13:30,309 --> 01:13:33,469
I know him. If he thinks I'm out on a limb
he's gonna try to get me off.

1232
01:13:37,486 --> 01:13:40,390
You still got your gun?
Yeah, but I got it packed away.

1233
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,060
Well, get it and keep it on you.

1234
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:43,880
I think Malatesta is our man.

1235
01:13:43,884 --> 01:13:46,844
And to me he adds up a killer.
And a violent one.

1236
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:49,556
You don't know him.
All I know is what you told me.

1237
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,590
He's kind and he's gentle and he likes you.

1238
01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:54,900
Well, he loved Father Tomasino.

1239
01:13:54,914 --> 01:13:56,574
You carry that gun. That's an order.

1240
01:13:57,685 --> 01:13:59,000
Yes, sir.

1241
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,349
Hello, Joe.
Hello, mamma.

1242
01:14:18,355 --> 01:14:22,425
Why are you home?
Sylvio said you were working tonight.

1243
01:14:22,431 --> 01:14:26,141
I'm on my way to the store now.
I forgot something and came to get it.

1244
01:14:26,764 --> 01:14:28,000
Joe.

1245
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:33,238
Maybe you can tell me.
What's the matter with Anna?

1246
01:14:33,244 --> 01:14:34,844
What's happening in this house?

1247
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:36,489
What about Anna?

1248
01:14:36,499 --> 01:14:39,219
She's been in her room for hours crying.

1249
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,510
She won't tell me anything.
I phoned Sylvio.

1250
01:14:42,528 --> 01:14:44,000
She won't talk to him.

1251
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:47,823
She won't eat. I took her up a tray
she wouldn't even touch it.

1252
01:14:49,006 --> 01:14:51,656
What's wrong with Anna, Joe?

1253
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:53,946
Does it have anything to do with you?

1254
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:57,360
I don't know, Mamma. I gotta hurry.
I gotta get to the store.

1255
01:14:57,378 --> 01:15:00,468
My house is full of unhappiness, Joe.

1256
01:15:00,678 --> 01:15:02,278
Joe!

1257
01:15:40,021 --> 01:15:41,301
Joe.

1258
01:15:41,378 --> 01:15:42,800
Joe, I've got to talk to you.

1259
01:15:42,803 --> 01:15:45,453
Not now, Anna.
It has to be now.

1260
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,467
It can't wait, Joe.

1261
01:15:51,188 --> 01:15:52,900
What are you doing with that gun?

1262
01:15:52,907 --> 01:15:54,387
You shouldn't have come in here, Anna.

1263
01:15:54,394 --> 01:15:56,734
What's that for?
It doesn't concern you.

1264
01:15:56,748 --> 01:15:58,840
Where are you going?
I'm going to the store. I'm working...

1265
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:01,300
You don't need a gun in the store.
Joe, listen.

1266
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:03,700
Let me go!
Whatever is wrong, maybe we can work it out.

1267
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,166
Please, don't make it worse.

1268
01:16:05,174 --> 01:16:08,454
If we have to, we can go away.
I'll do anything.

1269
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:11,434
Joe, I love you.

1270
01:16:11,449 --> 01:16:13,820
Nothing else matters.

1271
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:18,298
I might have to ask you
to remember that, Anna.

1272
01:16:22,002 --> 01:16:23,052
Joe!

1273
01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:52,927
Come on in.
I've been waiting for you.

1274
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,860
Why are you closed?
I don't want anyone else around.

1275
01:17:06,464 --> 01:17:07,954
What are you doing to Anna?

1276
01:17:13,764 --> 01:17:15,574
I don't know what you're talking about.

1277
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:17,372
She just called me.

1278
01:17:17,389 --> 01:17:20,289
She's almost out of her mind
worrying about you.

1279
01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:23,383
What did she say, Sylvio?

1280
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:26,282
She told me you used to be a cop.

1281
01:17:26,297 --> 01:17:29,877
You got in some kind of trouble
now you're going to make it worse.

1282
01:17:29,887 --> 01:17:31,807
You're carrying a gun.

1283
01:17:32,118 --> 01:17:33,718
Why?

1284
01:17:35,036 --> 01:17:36,400
It's none of your business.

1285
01:17:37,615 --> 01:17:41,275
Anything that hurts Anna is my business.

1286
01:17:42,687 --> 01:17:44,027
Give me that gun.

1287
01:17:44,045 --> 01:17:45,145
No.

1288
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,989
I'm gonna meet a man at 12:30.
I'm gonna need it.

1289
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,240
Why?

1290
01:17:51,155 --> 01:17:52,935
I'm gonna kill him.

1291
01:17:54,457 --> 01:17:56,527
You're crazy, Joe.

1292
01:17:56,536 --> 01:17:58,716
If I don't kill him,
he could put me in the gas chamber.

1293
01:17:58,737 --> 01:18:00,497
Im not gonna take any chances.

1294
01:18:02,332 --> 01:18:03,612
Joe.

1295
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:08,623
Come here, Joe.

1296
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:19,801
Pull up a chair.

1297
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:27,548
Sit down.

1298
01:18:31,966 --> 01:18:33,246
Now look, Joe.

1299
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:36,625
Last night I told Anna not to interfere.

1300
01:18:36,636 --> 01:18:40,100
To let you work out your own problems
by yourself.

1301
01:18:40,209 --> 01:18:42,089
I was wrong.

1302
01:18:42,992 --> 01:18:45,372
My family is being torn apart.

1303
01:18:45,397 --> 01:18:47,737
I can't let that happen, Joe.

1304
01:18:47,865 --> 01:18:50,045
You've gotta tell me what it is.

1305
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:52,700
What have you done?
I haven't done anything.

1306
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:56,030
I don't expect anybody to believe me.
I'll believe you...

1307
01:18:56,059 --> 01:18:58,489
It's not enough, Sylvio.
Everything is stacked against me.

1308
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,660
It's my own fault too.

1309
01:19:00,993 --> 01:19:02,163
You wanna know why?

1310
01:19:02,173 --> 01:19:03,763
Because I talk too much.

1311
01:19:03,778 --> 01:19:06,068
That's the reason
the cops dragged me in for questioning.

1312
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,765
They got a motive.
But they can't prove I was in town.

1313
01:19:08,771 --> 01:19:12,751
The guy I'm gonna meet tonight
not only can put me in town but at the parish

1314
01:19:12,766 --> 01:19:14,410
a half hour before it happened.

1315
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:17,744
Before what happened?

1316
01:19:20,066 --> 01:19:22,200
They think I killed Father Tomasino.

1317
01:19:23,315 --> 01:19:24,715
They're crazy.

1318
01:19:24,732 --> 01:19:28,232
You said you were in a hotel room
in Santa Rosa.

1319
01:19:28,261 --> 01:19:29,361
Well I wasn't

1320
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:32,220
One of the bellhops was driving into town
so he gave me a lift.

1321
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:33,990
He left me off at the parish house.

1322
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,267
Instead of going in I went for a walk.

1323
01:19:36,274 --> 01:19:38,130
Only I can't prove it.

1324
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,548
Why should you have to?

1325
01:19:39,572 --> 01:19:42,132
Do they know how much Father Tomasino
meant to you?

1326
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:46,341
Sure, but the only important thing to them
is that I had a big argument with Father Tomasino

1327
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:48,052
 about being kicked off the Force.

1328
01:19:49,764 --> 01:19:51,874
If that bellhop goes to the cops I'm through.

1329
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,290
He wants a thousand dollars
to keep his mouth shut.

1330
01:19:54,302 --> 01:19:56,332
He expects me to give it to him tonight.

1331
01:19:56,349 --> 01:19:58,550
Pay him, Joe.

1332
01:19:58,559 --> 01:19:59,629
Pay him.
No.

1333
01:19:59,646 --> 01:20:02,566
I'll give you the money.
No, Sylvio. In a few more weeks...

1334
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:04,228
he'll want another thousand, then another.

1335
01:20:04,265 --> 01:20:06,600
I'll be paying for the rest of my life.

1336
01:20:09,116 --> 01:20:10,726
I'm gonna meet him on the pier.

1337
01:20:10,742 --> 01:20:12,932
Nobody will be around that late.

1338
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:16,439
The body will float out to sea.

1339
01:20:17,264 --> 01:20:20,234
Even if they do find it,
nobody can pin it on me.

1340
01:20:24,346 --> 01:20:26,126
You can't do it, Joe.

1341
01:20:32,638 --> 01:20:34,538
You can't do it.

1342
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:38,521
Even if you get away with it,
you can't do it.

1343
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:42,636
It will always be on your mind.

1344
01:20:42,976 --> 01:20:45,306
You can't get rid of it.

1345
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:48,822
You can't sleep.

1346
01:20:48,835 --> 01:20:52,255
All night you wait for mornings
you can stop being alone.

1347
01:20:53,362 --> 01:20:55,232
Sometimes you act like a clown.

1348
01:20:56,445 --> 01:20:58,435
You laugh when there's nothing to laugh at.

1349
01:20:59,946 --> 01:21:03,000
You gotta have people around
so you that don't have a chance to think.

1350
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:07,469
But you can't stop thinking
because it's inside of your brain

1351
01:21:07,473 --> 01:21:09,213
and you can't tear it out.

1352
01:21:09,227 --> 01:21:11,367
I know, Joe.

1353
01:21:11,473 --> 01:21:13,153
I know.

1354
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:16,756
What do you know?

1355
01:21:16,769 --> 01:21:20,059
The only problem you ever had is whether
the salmon are gonna run.

1356
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:36,707
I killed somebody.

1357
01:21:36,738 --> 01:21:39,228
That's how I know.

1358
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,171
Who?

1359
01:21:41,384 --> 01:21:43,654
Angelina Poletti.

1360
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:47,480
A girl in Naples during the war.

1361
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:51,442
She was going to run away with another man.

1362
01:21:52,962 --> 01:21:54,702
I went crazy.

1363
01:21:56,456 --> 01:21:59,006
She was found dead after a bombing raid.

1364
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:02,736
They never knew how she died.

1365
01:22:04,443 --> 01:22:06,373
Nobody never knew.

1366
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,746
Nobody, Sylvio?

1367
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,588
Nobody.

1368
01:22:13,599 --> 01:22:15,769
Didn't you confess to your priest?

1369
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,488
Didn't you tell Father Tomasino?

1370
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:27,161
What are you trying to make me say?

1371
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:28,429
You just said it.

1372
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:36,041
The only argument I had left
was that you had no reason to kill Father Tomasimo.

1373
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:39,000
Now you just gave it to me.

1374
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,722
So...

1375
01:22:45,438 --> 01:22:47,948
everything you said tonight was a lie, eh?

1376
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:52,000
Everything you ever said was a lie.

1377
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:53,987
You're a cop.

1378
01:22:53,992 --> 01:22:55,812
That's why you came here.

1379
01:22:55,861 --> 01:22:57,981
Pretended to be my friend.

1380
01:22:57,988 --> 01:23:00,178
Moved into my house.

1381
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:03,088
You made love to Anna,
even asked her to marry you

1382
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,659
just so that you could get at me, didn't you?

1383
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:08,532
I have lived in hell for years
just to keep my family from being hurt.

1384
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:11,220
But you don't care what happens to them, do you?

1385
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:13,211
Damn you! I'll kill you!

1386
01:23:13,228 --> 01:23:17,828
In God's name.

1387
01:23:18,015 --> 01:23:20,585
I'd give my life to make them happy.

1388
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:22,386
On my life.

1389
01:23:22,396 --> 01:23:23,866
On my life.

1390
01:24:12,873 --> 01:24:14,543
Is that the knife you used...

1391
01:24:14,554 --> 01:24:17,174
when you killed Father Tomasino?

1392
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:34,526
Sylvio.

1393
01:24:35,668 --> 01:24:36,668
Sylvio.

1394
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:40,117
Sylvio.

1395
01:24:46,327 --> 01:24:47,540
It wasn't my fault.

1396
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:49,345
He didn't look where he was going.

1397
01:24:49,356 --> 01:24:52,900
I didn't have a chance to stop.
You saw it. You know it wasn't my fault.

1398
01:24:52,908 --> 01:24:54,368
Somebody get an ambulance.

1399
01:25:05,477 --> 01:25:06,647
Father.

1400
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:10,930
Wait. He wanted to talk to Anna and Joe alone.

1401
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,650
I think you better go in now.

1402
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,572
Father Giuseppe.

1403
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:24,934
Anna.

1404
01:25:24,946 --> 01:25:26,366
You trust him.

1405
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:30,000
Don't make big things out of nothing, Anna.

1406
01:25:31,207 --> 01:25:34,100
Joe has no more problems now.

1407
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,500
We've straightened everything out.

1408
01:25:39,017 --> 01:25:40,277
Didn't we, Joe?

1409
01:25:42,589 --> 01:25:44,439
He's a good boy.

1410
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:47,621
He's gonna take care of you.

1411
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,632
And mamma.

1412
01:25:51,048 --> 01:25:52,568
And Pietro.

1413
01:25:54,477 --> 01:25:55,677
Hey, Joe.

1414
01:25:56,781 --> 01:25:59,481
If you have to wallop Pietro

1415
01:26:00,052 --> 01:26:02,272
It's okay with me.

1416
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:05,925
You're the boss now.

1417
01:26:06,838 --> 01:26:08,328
Okay, Joe?

1418
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,780
Go, now.

1419
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:15,900
Baby.

1420
01:26:17,648 --> 01:26:19,338
My baby.

1421
01:26:19,745 --> 01:26:21,145
Joe.

1422
01:26:23,857 --> 01:26:26,107
Joe will be right out.

1423
01:26:34,717 --> 01:26:35,887
Joe.

1424
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:41,370
Father Tomasino told me to go to the police.

1425
01:26:42,589 --> 01:26:44,169
But I didn't.

1426
01:26:46,003 --> 01:26:47,343
I couldn't.

1427
01:26:48,557 --> 01:26:51,327
I couldn't hurt mamma and Anna, Joe.

1428
01:26:53,233 --> 01:26:54,453
You know...

1429
01:26:54,467 --> 01:26:57,547
wherever I went I saw his eyes.

1430
01:26:58,554 --> 01:27:00,154
They were gentle.

1431
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,659
But they knew.

1432
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:07,015
It kept getting worse and worse.

1433
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,743
Then I saw his eyes all the time.

1434
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,139
I couldn't stand it, Joe.

1435
01:27:14,858 --> 01:27:16,048
Sylvio...

1436
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:19,147
I had to do it, Joe.

1437
01:27:21,557 --> 01:27:23,327
I had to do it.

1438
01:27:27,538 --> 01:27:28,538
Joe.

1439
01:27:30,314 --> 01:27:33,144
Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?

1440
01:27:34,054 --> 01:27:36,124
Sure, Sylvio, sure.

1441
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,506
Thank you, Joe.

1442
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,800
Thank you, Joe.

1443
01:28:17,117 --> 01:28:18,407
Joe.

1444
01:28:21,183 --> 01:28:22,183
Well?

1445
01:28:27,155 --> 01:28:28,955
The accident beat me to it.

1446
01:28:28,918 --> 01:28:31,418
I didn't find out a thing.
