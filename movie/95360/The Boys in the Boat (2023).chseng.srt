天啊
Oh, man!

12
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,030
搞什么鬼？
What the heck?

13
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,910
我发誓那小子会要了我的命
I swear that boy's gonna be the death of me.

工程设计和其他创意领域
Engineering design is different

17
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,170
有点不同
from other areas of creativity

18
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,360
在这一点上，你必须有能力真正建造出
in that, you must be able to actually build

19
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,870
你的创意
what you imagine.

20
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,430
然后确保它按照你的设计方式运行
And then make sure it works as you designed.

21
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,360
设计过程有助于结构化引导
The design process is structured to help direct

22
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,790
你的创造力

现在...
Now, uh...

24
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,650
你想成为哪种工程师？
What kinda engineer you wanna be?

25
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,400
我想当个机械工程师，因为我喜欢造东西
I'm thinking mechanical for me, 'cause I like building things.

26
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,100
－嗯哼　－你想成为...
- Mm-hmm. - You wanna partner up on...

27
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,600
两位先生有什么想和我们分享的吗？
Something you two gentlemen would like to share with us?

28
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,040
或者我可以继续了吗？
Or can I continue?

29
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,720
对不起
Sorry.

30
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,030
－谢谢　－好极了，谢谢
- Thank you. - Awesome. Thank you.

31
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,050
好吧，我还要一个人
Okay, I just need one more.

32
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,880
让我看看
Let's see.

33
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,630
你
Uh, you.

34
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,570
今天就到这儿吧，伙计们，对不起
That's all I need today, fellas. Sorry.

35
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,320
－早安　－早上好
- Morning. - Morning.

36
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,010
这是我今天早上收到的
This was in my box this morning.

37
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,840
好吧，看来你还欠着本学期的
Okay, it looks like you still owe a balance

38
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,030
一点学费
on this semester.

39
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,710
对，我已经付了一半了
Yeah, well, I paid half already

40
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,000
他们说我可以稍后再付另一半
and they said I could pay the other half later.

41
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,550
兰茨先生，恐怕已经到期了
Afraid later has arrived, Mr. Rantz.

42
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,580
也许干点兼职会有帮助
Maybe a part-time job would help.

43
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,030
我一直在找
I've been looking.

44
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,500
走廊尽头有一块公告牌
Well, there's a board down the hall.

45
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,540
我可以给你延期两周
I can give you two weeks.

46
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,660
之后，您就需要考虑
After that, you will need to consider

47
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,430
其他的教育选项了
other educational options.

48
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,170
谢谢
Thanks.

49
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,340
浪费时间，我打遍了这里所有的电话
It's a waste of time. I called every number up here.

50
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,310
甚至那份保姆工作都问过
And that nanny job,

51
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,270
在学期开始前就已全部招满了
all filled before semester even started.

52
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,570
我每天都来查查，想抢个新机会
I check every day to get a jump on a new one,

53
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,840
但是一个机会都没有
but there hadn't been any.

54
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,470
在我租得起房子之前，我只能住在姑妈家
I'm staying with my aunt till I can afford a place.

55
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,180
每天都要花上半天时间从衣服上扯猫毛
I spend half my day pulling cat hair off of my clothes.

56
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,380
我讨厌猫
I hate cats.

57
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,810
你喜欢吗？
You like 'em?

58
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,180
我是说猫
Cats, I mean.

59
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,450
我，呃，从来没怎么考虑过它们
I, uh, never thought much about 'em.

60
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,580
我讨厌他们
I hate 'em.

61
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,940
我想我在课堂上见过你
Thought I saw you in class.

62
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,070
－你还记得我吗？－嗯
- You remember me? - Mm-hmm.

63
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,830
好吧，那我叫什么名字？
All right. Then, what's my name?

64
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,230
乔伊斯・西姆达斯
Uh, Joyce Simdars.

65
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,300
－你是乔・兰兹　－嗯哼
- And you're Joe Rantz. - Uh-huh.

66
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,740
我记得，因为四年级的时候
I remember because you had a huge crush on me

67
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,000
你暗恋我来着
in the fourth grade.

68
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,510
－不，我没有　－你有
- No, I didn't. - Yeah, yeah, you did.

69
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,910
你给我做了张漂亮的小卡片
You made me this pretty little card

70
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,500
里面夹着几朵小花
with some flowers stuffed in it.

71
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,480
就在我家搬去奥林匹亚之前
Right before my family went away to Olympia.

72
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,450
－啊　－你是那种一紧张就
- Uh... - Are you one of those people

73
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,790
吃不下东西的人吗？
who can't eat when you're nervous?

74
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,780
－我没紧张　－没？
- I'm not nervous. - No?

75
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,990
那么，你在这里做什么，乔？
So, what are you doing here, Joe?

76
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
我在这学习，呃，工程学
I'm trying to learn, uh, engineering.

77
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,220
嗯
Hmm.

78
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,970
我要当老师
I'm gonna be a teacher.

79
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,440
不过，来这里主要还是为了离家远点
Mostly here just to get away from home, though.

80
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,810
你还记得我妈妈吗？
You remember my mother?

81
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,810
算是吧，她手里总是拿着本《圣经》
Sorta. Always had a Bible in her hand.

82
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,870
是啊
Yeah.

83
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,360
除非她扔过来砸你
Unless she's throwing it at you.

84
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,590
你喜欢划艇吗？
You like rowboats?

85
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,820
你知道的，坐在上面划水那种
You know, like, paddlin' 'em.

86
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,680
－你是谁？－我是罗杰
- Who's this? - I'm Roger.

87
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,480
嗨，罗杰，我是乔伊斯
Hi, Roger. I'm Joyce.

88
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,590
这是乔，但他现在不太爱说话
This is Joe, but he's not real talkative right now

89
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,010
因为他有点紧张
'cause he's a little bit nervous.

90
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,820
－不，我没有，我没有　－他有点紧张
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not. - He is a little nervous.

91
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,100
我不紧张
I'm not nervous.

92
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,830
如果你会划，我们也许能赚点钱
We might be able to make some money if you can row.

93
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,190
－乔伊斯，好了吗？－哦，得走了，孩子们
- Joyce, you ready? - Oh. Gotta go, boys.

94
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,740
很高兴再次见到你，乔
Nice seeing you again, Joe.

95
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,970
罗杰
Roger.

96
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,960
顺便说一句
By the way,

97
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,250
你从那段暗恋中走出来过吗？
did you ever get over that crush?

98
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,450
来吧，我们走
Come on, let's go.

99
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,690
她很好看，是吧？
She's a looker, huh?

100
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,250
那么，赚钱是怎么回事？
So, what's that about making some money?

101
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,490
对，赛艇队
Yeah, the rowing team.

102
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,890
只要进了队，你就算得到了一份兼职
You're on it, you get a part-time job

103
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,360
还包括一个便宜的住的地方
including a cheap place to live.

104
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,050
我就可以摆脱那些猫了
I could get free of them cats.

105
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,760
你要做的就是进队
All you gotta do is make the team.

106
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,180
这有什么难的？
How hard can that be?

107
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,260
有多少人能进队？
How many make the team?

108
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,940
嘿，有多少，呃...
Hey, how many, uh...

109
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,910
要选多少人？
How many fellas get picked?

110
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,450
我想是8个
Eight, I think.

111
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,770
8个？
Eight?

112
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,950
他说什么？
What's he say?

113
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,380
他不知道
He didn't know.

114
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,720
好了，听着
All right, listen up.

115
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,120
我是乌尔布里克森教练
I'm Coach Ulbrickson.

116
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,190
那是博尔斯教练
Well, that's Coach Bolles,

117
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,900
布朗教练
Coach Brown.

118
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,380
现在，你们来这里，是因为我们正在遴选
Now, you're all here because we're looking

119
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,000
8名最有资格的年轻人来组成初级队
for the eight most qualified young men to fill out JV boat.

120
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,250
这意味着你们中的大多数人都不会被选中
That means most of you will not be chosen.

121
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,380
事实上，你们中的大多数人很可能会
In fact, the majority of you will most likely

122
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,900
在接下来的几周内自行离开
walk away on your own within the next few weeks,

123
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,260
因为你们的身体会受伤
'cause your bodies will hurt,

124
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,670
精神会疲倦
minds will tire,

125
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,250
你会认定你要与世界上
and you'll decide this dream of yours

126
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,120
最优秀的赛艇选手同台竞技的梦想
to compete against the greatest crews in the world

127
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,520
就是不值得的
is just not worth it.

128
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,350
这并不丢人
There's no shame in that.

129
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
8人赛艇
Eight-man crew

130
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,170
是世界上最难的团队运动
is the most difficult team sport in the world.

131
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,570
普通人的身体根本无法承受这些
The average human body is just not meant for such things.

132
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,140
根本做不了这种事
It's just not capable of such things.

133
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,970
但普通人是不可能在我的艇上找到座位的
But average is not gonna get a seat on my boat.

134
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,210
所以，祝你好运
So, good luck.

135
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,480
好的，分成两队
Okay. Fall into two lines.

136
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,770
左边是注册生，右边是自费生
Registration on the left. Uniforms on the right.

137
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,290
说得真好，教练
That was a beautiful speech, Coach.

138
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,590
－姓名？－乔・兰兹
- Name? - Uh, Joe Rantz.

139
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,490
乔，你以前当过艇员吗？
Joe, you ever crewed before?

140
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,760
呃...呃...
Uh... Um...

141
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,260
划艇，你划过艇吗？
Row. You ever rowed before?

142
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,700
不，不，呃...
No. No. Uh...

143
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,510
入队后这份工作的薪水是多少？
How much does the job pay once you're on the team?

144
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,310
去那边拿你的装备
Go pick up your gear over there.

145
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,720
－去右边，下一个　－姓名？

罗杰，你以前当过艇员吗？

148
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,440
不
No.

149
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,210
好的
All right.

150
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,730
到对面领装备
Pick up your gear across the way.

151
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,550
你们将被分成几个小组

152
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,480
并在训练坞进行轮换

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,070
叫到自己的号码时，跟着教练走

One through 16, you're with me,

155
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,010

排好队
Line up.

158
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,680
你知道我们要干什么去吗？
You got any idea what we're in for?

159
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,930
我不知道
I don't know.

160
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,160
很好，我也是
Good. Me either.

161
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,480
1到16号，快点
One through 16, come on.

162
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,390
一般成年男子有能力

每分钟吸入大约四升氧气

164
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,950
一个桨手必须达到8个人的消耗量
An oarsman must be able to consume as much as eight.

165
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,450
你必须让你的身体学会这种能力
You have to teach your bodies to do that.

166
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,410
－我们做50个俯卧撑
- We'll do 50 push-ups,

167
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,000
然后是50个仰卧起坐和50组往返跑
followed by 50 sit-ups and 50 jacks.

168
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,840
我们将继续做50组

169
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,620
直到换训练坞的时候

170

171
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,070
脚放在踏板上
Feet in stretchers.

172
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,400
系上鞋带
Lace 'em up.

173
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,640
让我们把老尼禄号划出去
Let's take Old Nero out.

174
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,850
好了，听我口令，挺直腰板，用你的腿
All right, on my count, straight backs, use your legs.

175
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,980
12号！别光拍水，转动你的手腕
Twelve! Don't just slap the water. Roll your wrists.

176
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,020
起，躺

177
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,080
起，躺
Up, down.

178
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,930
四，五，六，七

00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,020
一，二，三，四

181
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,370
一，二，三，四

182
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,970
入水，推进，完成，归位

183
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,840
入水，推进，完成，归位

184
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,680
到码头了，所有人下艇

185
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,480

188
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,480

189
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,580
交换
Switch!

190
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,850
都准备好了吗？
All set?

191
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,560
起，躺
Up, down.

192
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,160
起，躺
Up, down.

193
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,460
运桨分四个步骤，先生们
There's four parts to a stroke, gentlemen,

194
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,830
不是三个，好吗？
not three, okay?

195
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,270
入水，推进，完成，归位
Catch, drive, finish, and recovery.

196
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,200
一个都不能少
You can't skip any of 'em.

197
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,640
你们知道我们为什么没走直线吗？
And you know why we're not going in a straight line?

198
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,110
因为22号
'Cause number 22 here

199
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,210
是这里唯一一个在听我说话的人
is the only one that's listening to me.

200
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,380
入水，推进
Catch, drive,

201
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,620
完成，归位
finish, recovery.

202
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,710
这样好多了
That's better.

203
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,250
好的，让我们加快节奏到18拍
All right. Let's pick up the pace to 18.

204
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,360
这里有很多好木材啊，教练
Lot of tall timber in this bunch, Coach.

205
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,670
那边的孩子几乎没有能比得上你们校队的
Few boys there could even push your varsity crew.

206
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,400
才第一天，还很难说呢
It's hard to judge off one day.

207
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,730
不过，你还要看到什么
Still, you had to see enough

208
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,530
才能让你开怀大笑？
to make you almost finally crack a smile?

209
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,690
赛季结束后我会告诉你的，啊？
Yeah, I'll let you know at the end of the season, huh?

210
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,630
奥运年，今年
Olympic year, this year,

211
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,360
所以假如理想的话，他们的训练时间要比以往更长
so ideally, they'll stretch longer than most.

212
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,190
奥运年？我都没有意识到
Olympic year? I didn't realize.

213
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,060
我在加州大学和埃布莱特教练谈过了
I spoke with Coach Ebright down in Cali.

214
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,360
他肯定意识到了
He's sure aware of it.

215
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,630
他对自己的机会也很有信心
Feels good about his chances, too.

216
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,470
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

217
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,160
有什么第一印象想报道出来的吗？
Any first impressions you'd like to see in print?

218
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,230
你知道我不看报纸的，洛伊尔
You know I don't read the paper, Royal.

219
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,580
对不起，教练
Excuse me, Coach.

220
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,150
如果你想问诀窍，那就与其他人一样
If you're looking for tips, you're gonna have to get 'em

221
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,530
在训练中去找吧
in practice like everybody else.

222
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,740
不，先生，我只是想知道会给多少工资
No, sir. I was just wondering how much this paid.

223
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,850
再说一遍？
Say again?

224
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,140
他们说，如果能入选，还能得到一份工作？
They said there was a job included if you make the team?

225
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,290
我只想知道够不够支付
I just need to know if it's gonna cover

226
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,450
我剩下的学费
the rest of my tuition.

227
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,490
是的，我肯定是够的
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

228
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,100
嘿，你先集中精力看能不能入选吧，孩子
Hey, you just concentrate for now on making the squad, son.

229
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,100
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

230
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,540
现在，我打赌这个问题
Now, there's a question I bet

231
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,340
那些常春藤联盟的教练们永远也不会遇到
those Ivy League coaches never get.

232
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,570
说到
Speakin' of,

233
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,350
我当然希望今年能比去年更好
I sure hope this year goes better than the last.

234
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,400
没有人比我更支持你的孩子们了
No one's rooting for your boys more than me.

235
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,740
－祝你好运，教练　－你也是，洛伊尔
- Good luck, Coach. - And you, Royal.

236
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,830
你去吃东西吗？
Did you go grab some food?

237
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,210
啊，我不饿
Ah, I'm not hungry.

238
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,450
如果你想要吃的话，我拿的足够我们俩吃的
I got enough for us both if you want it.

239
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,590
没那么饿
Not that hungry.

240
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,460
回头见
I'll see you later.

241
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,100
我很感激
I appreciate it.

242
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,350
给你
There you go.

243
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,520
－给你，先生　－谢谢
- Here you go, sir. - Thank you.

244
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,450
鸡肉怎么样？
How's your chicken?

245
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,570
很不错，谢谢
Great. Thanks.

246
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,230
是吗，你吃的是猪排
Yeah, that's a pork chop you're eating.

247
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,490
啊
Ah.

248
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,270
对不起
Sorry.

249
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,940
所以，我今天见到了洛伊尔・布鲁姆
So, I saw Royal Brougham today.

250
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,500
他还特意告诉我
And he made sure to tell me

251
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,330
凯・埃布莱特的球队今年实力强劲
that Ky Ebright's squad is strong this year.

252
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,790
加州大学队一直很强的
Cal is always strong.

253
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,890
而你一直在担心
And you always worry.

254
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,380
这帮新孩子们看起来怎么样？
How'd your new boys look?

255
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,220
现在下结论还为时过早
Well, it's too early to say.

256
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,180
人倒是有很多
There's definitely a lot of 'em.

257
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,710
很好，有这么大的马场可供选择
That's good. Nice big stable to choose from.

258
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,360
－如果有足够多的能坚持到最后　－最好的就会
- If enough of them last. - The best ones will.

259
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,010
－就像你一样　－嗯
- Just like you did. - Mm.

260
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,890
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

261
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,420
没什么，只是有点僵硬
Nothing, just a little stiff.

262
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,710
嗯，看到了，怎么搞的？
Yeah, looks it. How come?

263
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,440
划艇划到我们差点没命
Rowed boats till it almost killed us.

264
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,900
什么？
What?

265
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,270
课本第43页
Page 43 in your texts.

266
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,120
因此，在解决框架问题时
So, in solving the framework,

267
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,690
反射意味着什么？
what does it mean to reflect?

268
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,950
对不起，年轻人
Excuse me, young man.

269
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,120
要不要我小声点，好让你休息？
Would you like me to speak quieter so you can rest?

270
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,160
我感觉这可能是个陷阱问题
I feel like that's maybe a trick question.

271
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,840
－安静
- Quiet!

272
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,710
要么专心听讲，要么回家睡觉
Pay attention or go home to sleep.

273
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,240
你不能在这睡大觉
You can't do both in here.

274
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
不客气，乔・兰茨
You're welcome, Joe Rantz.

275
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,500
谢谢
Thank you.

276
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,500
三
Three.

277
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,390
四
Four.

278
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,930
推，然后拉，推...
Push, then pull. Push...

279
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,600
起，躺
Up, down!

280
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,170
48号和12号在艇头
48 and 12 on the bow.

281
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,480
是的，我想...
Yeah. I'm thinkin'...

282
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,180
把莫里斯放在兰茨身后的六号位？
What about Morris in the six behind Rantz?

283
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,570
跟上我的节奏
Keep time with me.

284
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,840
一，二，三，四，一，二...
Stroke, two, three, four. Stroke, two...

285
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,580
来吧，孩子们！谁更想要？
Come on, boys! Who wants it more?

286
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,340
继续蹬腿
Keep driving those legs!

287
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,250
不要让22号打败你！
Do not let 22 beat you!

288
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,310
你还记得我吗？
You still remember me?

289
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,410
嗯
Mm-hmm.

290
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,150
不确定
Wasn't sure.

291
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,460
最近很少见到你
Haven't seen you much lately.

292
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,330
我只是一直在忙事情
I just been busy with stuff.

293
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,110
－赛艇？－大部分是
- Rowing stuff? - Mostly.

294
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,590
嗯
Hmm.

295
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,400
我听罗杰说，他们今天要公布队员名单
I heard Roger say that they're announcing the team today.

296
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,590
你能进吗？
Are you gonna make it?

297
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,920
有很多人都想进
There's lot of guys tryin'.

298
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,670
等你进了，你想带我去坐艇兜风吗？
You wanna take me on a boat ride when you do?

299
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,760
当然
Sure.

300
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,380
先生们
Gentlemen, 

301
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,740
感谢大家参与
I wanna thank you all for comin' out

302
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,560
并全力以赴
and giving your best effort.

303
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,620
你们留在这里的每一个人
Every single one of you left standing

304
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,270
都有令人钦佩的表现
has performed admirably.

305
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,060
遗憾的是，你们中只有少数人可以被选中留下来继续
Unfortunately, only a few of you can be chosen to continue.

306
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,330
博尔斯教练
Coach Bolles.

307
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,930
休谟
Hume.

308
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,890
亨特
Hunt.

309
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,090
麦克米伦
McMillin.

310
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,870
戴
Day.

311
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,520
莫里斯
Morris.

312
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,720
怀特
White.

313
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,710
亚当
Adam.

314
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,670
兰茨
Rantz.

315
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,320
科伊，你是替补
Coy, you're the reserve.

316
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,820
感谢你们付出的时间和努力
We thank the rest of you for your time and your effort.

317
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
那好吧
All right, then.

318
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,310
去庆祝吧
Go and celebrate.

319
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,170
明天水上见
I will see you on the water tomorrow.

320
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,920
干得好
Well done.

321
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,940
这是我最喜欢的部分
That's my favorite part.

322
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,250
来吧，孩子们
Come on, boys.

323
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,710
我们走吧
Let's go.

324
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,260
现在把浆举起来
Now lift 'em up.

325
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,470
这家伙满嘴都是他的道奇
It's all this guy talks about, his Dodge.

326
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,740
嘿，听着，我划得太多了
Hey, listen, I've done so much rowing.

327
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,650
我就知道你会入选的
I knew you'd made it.

328
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,920
我很高兴我们中有个人做到了
I'm glad one of us did.

329
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,340
啊，你的入选一直都是稳的
Ah, you were always in the bag.

330
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,940
当教练叫到我的名字时，我的膝盖差点跪下了
When Coach called my name, my knees almost buckled.

331
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,470
不知道他们会给我们安排什么位置
I wonder what seats they'll put us in.

332
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,660
我只想坐在领桨手的位置上
I just want the stroke.

333
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,640
那是休姆的位置，我打包票
That's Hume's seat. Guaranteed.

334
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,140
嘿，你不是哑巴吧？
Hey, you're not a mute, are you?

335
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,240
因为我从没听你说过一句话
'Cause I've never once heard you say nothin'.

336
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,450
不是
No.

337
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
像他那样划桨，他不需要会说话
He doesn't need to talk, the way he pulls that oar.

338
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,850
是啊，查克，也许你应该多划桨少说话
Yeah, Chuck, maybe you should pull more and talk less,

339
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
如果你想坐那个领桨手座位
you want that stroke seat.

340
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,400
我不在乎他们把我放在哪里
I don't care where they put me,

341
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,610
只要我在就行
as long as I'm in there somewhere.

342
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,030
我们都会在的
We're all in there somewhere.

343
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,290
是啊
Yeah.

344
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,550
向华盛顿鞠躬
Bow down to Washington

345
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,060
向华盛顿鞠躬
Bow down to Washington

346
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,570
穿金戴银者威风凛凛
Mighty are the men who wear the purple and the gold

347
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,840
我们高兴地欢迎他们加入胜利者的行列
Joyfully we welcome them within the victor's fold

348
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,120
我们将把自己的名字刻在名人堂里
We will carve our names in the Hall of Fame

349
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,670
为了保留我们奉献的记忆
To preserve the memory of our devotion

350
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,180
所以，上天保佑华盛顿的敌人
So, heaven help the foes of Washington

351
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,560
他们在强大的华盛顿脚下瑟瑟发抖
They're trembling at the feet of mighty Washington

352
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,200
我们的小伙子在那里敲钟，他们的战斗血性出类拔萃
Our boys are there with bells, Their fighting blood excels

353
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,440
把他们推过界线比通过....
It's harder to push them over the lines than pass...

354
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,840
－嘿　－嗨
- Hey. - Hi.

355
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,240
你...
You, uh...

356
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,980
你想去赛艇上坐坐吗？
You wanna go for a boat ride?

357
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
现在？
Now?

358
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
是啊
Yeah.

359
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,280
好吧
Yeah, okay.

360
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,060
入水，推进
Catch, drive,

361
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,100
完成，归位
finish, recovery.

362
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,950
在重来一遍之前，你必须做完所有四个步骤
You gotta do all four before you can start again.

363
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,450
好多了，下一步你要翻桨了
That's better. You gotta feather next.

364
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,600
翻桨？什么是翻桨？
Feathering? What's feather?

365
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
看这里
Here, look.

366
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,930
你滚动你的手腕
You roll your wrists

367
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,480
转动艇桨
to spin the oar.

368
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,060
－看到了吗？－嗯
- You see? - Mm.

369
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,340
现在，再试一次
Now, try again.

370
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,330
你是天生的
You're a natural.

371
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,200
我以为你说要带我坐着艇兜风去
I thought you said you were gonna take me on a boat ride.

372
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,920
好吧，坐过去点
All right, scooch over.

373
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,930
好的
All right.

374
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,480
你喜欢吗？划艇？
Do you like it? Rowing?

375
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,900
还行
Well,

376
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,290
得到一份工作
gettin' a job out of it.

377
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,240
还有一个房间，所以，我猜
And a room. So, I guess.

378
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,030
还有谁入选了？
Who else made the team?

379
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,270
罗杰，矮子和其他一些人
Roger, Shorty, some others.

380
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,220
你知道，他们会在广播里播报比赛
You know, they put the races on the radio.

381
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,950
每个人都在听
Everybody listens.

382
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,340
他们拍了一些照片
Yeah, they took, uh, some photos.

383
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,850
－问了一堆问题　－什么样的问题？
- Asked a bunch of questions. - What kinds of questions?

384
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,040
就是，你知道
It's just, you know,

385
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,620
我们来自哪里，诸如此类的
where we're from, stuff like that.

386
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,840
你告诉他们事实了吗？
Did you tell them the truth?

387
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,420
嗯，差不多吧
Mm. Mostly.

388
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,150
你们都会出名的
You're all gonna be famous.

389
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,420
然后你就真的会忘记我了
Then you really will forget about me.

390
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,660
就算我想，我觉得我也做不到
I don't think I could if I tried.

391
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,550
你得把我们划回岸上
You get to row us back to shore.

392
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,970
我们早上还有课
We have class in the morning.

393
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,300
－你想要哪张床？－我不在乎
- Which bed you want? - Couldn't care less.

394
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,670
哦，不错
Oh, nice.

395
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,510
我们可以留着这些，对吗？
We get to keep these, right?

396
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,540
只要我们还在队里
Long as we stay on the team.

397
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,620
艇上的每个座位都有自己的用途
Each seat on the boat has its own purpose.

398
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,950
就像一匹高大赛马身上的8个独立部位
Like eight separate parts of one great racehorse.

399
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,740
莫里斯在一号，戴在二号
Morris in one, Day in two,

400
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,490
亚当在三号
and Adam in the three.

401
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,360
你们的技术要让艇保持正确的航向
Your technique will keep the boat on its proper course.

402
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,110
而四，五，六就像是引擎舱
And four, five, and six are like the engine room.

403
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,580
这是力量源泉
That is the power.

404
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,030
怀特，麦克米伦和亨特
White, McMillin, and Hunt.

405
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,340
现在，兰茨是我们的七号
Now, Rantz is our seven.

406
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,160
所以，你和休姆，领桨员，一起设定节奏
So, you set the pace with Hume, the stroke.

407
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,220
每一匹好赛马都有一个骑师
And every good racehorse has a jockey.

408
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,580
格伦・莫里...
Glenn Morry...

409
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,210
来吧，格伦
Come on, Glenn.

410
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,040
是我们的舵手
is our coxswain.

411
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,930
现在，他指挥的策略
Now, he calls the strategy

412
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,210
是由我和博尔斯教练设定的
set up by myself and Coach Bolles.

413
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,830
他想让你们跑的时候，就会给你们松缰绳
He'll give you rein when he wants you to run,

414
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,000
他会把缰绳拉紧，让你们慢下来
he'll pull you back to slow you down.

415
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,390
一旦时机成熟，他就会拿出鞭子
And when the time is right, he'll get out his whip.

416
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,840
嘿，伙计们
Hey, fellas.

417
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,730
好了，该下水了
Okay, time to get in the water.

418
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,400
我们再来一次！
Let's go again!

419
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,890
嘿，菜鸟队
Hey, junior boat,

420
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,790
第一天，累吗？
you tired after your first day?

421
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,170
他不会成功的，别这么认真
He'll never make it. Don't take it so hard.

422
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,030
嘿，你去哪儿？回来
Hey, where you going? Come back.

423
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,830
我讨厌那些混蛋
I hate those assholes.

424
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,300
你得学会掌握自己的节奏
You gotta learn to pace yourself.

425
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,610
－乔，对吧？　－嗯哼
- It's Joe, isn't it? - Mm-hmm.

426
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,480
你们大多数人都对艇不感兴趣
Most of you boys don't have an interest in a boat

427
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,870
直到你坐在里面
until you can sit in it.

428
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,410
你喜欢做木工活吗？
You like to work with wood?

429
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,590
是的，我父亲做过一些
Yeah, my father did some.

430
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,310
他以前会做些东西
He used to make things.

431
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,700
不是这种，就是门廊之类的东西
Nothing like this, just porches and stuff.

432
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,450
有一次，我帮他修好了一艘旧独木舟
I helped him fix up an old canoe once.

433
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,780
我相信他和你的母亲现在一定为你感到非常骄傲
I'm sure he and your mother must be very proud of you now.

434
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,210
加入赛艇队
Making the team.

435
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,860
这是给你们的
This is for you boys.

436
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,520
你们的比赛艇
Your racing shell.

437
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,120
随时欢迎你来帮我一把
Always welcome to give me a hand with it.

438
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,270
如果你有空的话
If you find some free time.

439
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,030
不，我不是说现在
No, I didn't mean right now.

440
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,880
你今晚应该好好休息
You should rest up tonight.

441
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,140
我没事
I'm okay.

442
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,520
技术比力量更重要
Technique is more important than power.

443
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,310
你必须学会划出完美的桨法
You have to be able to pull a perfect oar, 

444
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,440
一桨接着一桨
stroke after stroke.

445
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,520
所谓摇摆
It's called swing.

446
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,960
当8个人全都划得如此整齐划一
When all eight are rowing in such perfect unison

447
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,620
没有任何一个动作
that no single action

448
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,560
和艇上其他人的不同步
is out of sync with the rest of the boat.

449
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,730
这样你们的力量就不会互相抵消了
Then you aren't fighting each other.

450
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,770
艇跑起来更省力
You're moving with less effort.

451
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,640
你划出的每一桨都相当于
Each one of your strokes is worth

452
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,700
另一艘艇的一桨半
one and a half of the other boat's.

453
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,420
大多数艇员从未领略过
Most crews never find it.

454
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,380
但当他们领略到时
But when they do, 

455
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,630
赛艇与其说是一项运动，不如说是一首诗
rowing is more poetry than sport.

456
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,070
怀特和戴，交换位置
White and Day, switch.

457
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,340
兰茨，亚当
Rantz, Adam,

458
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,390
换回来
switch back.

459
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,220
划！
Row!

460
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
划！
Row!

461
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,020
－划！－来吧
- Row! - Come on!

462
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,930
－划！－来吧
- Row! - Come on!

463
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,300
划！划过湖面
Row! Row through the lake!

464
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,860
划！用力
Row! More!

465
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,510
怎么，你们把最近三年学过的东西
What, did you forget everything you learned

466
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,970
都忘了吗？
in the last three years?

467
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,410
布朗，你还在划空
Brown, you're still skying.

468
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,700
比林斯，你是领桨员吗？你在赶
Billings, are you the stroke? You're rushing.

469
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,540
你身后有七个人，都被你带得很赶
You have seven men behind you, all chasing the boat.

470
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,360
34桨
34 strokes.

471
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,000
你们划34桨没问题
You're fine at 34 strokes.

472
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,010
再高一点，你们就崩溃了
Anything higher and you fall apart.

473
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,140
34桨，你们赢不了加州大学
34 strokes, you don't beat Cal.

474
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,450
34桨
34 strokes,

475
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,130
在波基普西你们赢不了
you don't win at Poughkeepsie.

476
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,660
你们肯定去不了德国
You certainly don't get to Germany.

477
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,710
你们知道34桨能打败谁吗？
You know who you beat with 34 strokes?

478
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,650
初级队
The JV boat.

479
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,670
只是可能
Maybe.

480
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,270
你们还在等什么？回到艇上去
What are you guys waiting for? Get back in the boat.

481
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,750
你们，你们要回到那里去
You guys, you're gonna get back out there

482
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,810
然后再做一次，直到做对为止！
and you're gonna do it again until you get it right!

483
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,710
希望我没有打扰你，艾尔
Hope I'm not intruding, Al.

484
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,640
不，本，进来吧，请坐
Not at all, Ben. Come on in. Take a seat.

485
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,060
正是时候
Great timing.

486
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,050
刚好在查看准备送交贵委员会的
Just going through the equipment budget

487
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,480
设备预算
to send over to your committee.

488
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,390
没什么不合理的
Nothing unreasonable.

489
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,350
体育馆的一些部分
Some pieces for the gymnasium.

490
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,480
还有五年前的制服
And the five-year-old uniforms

491
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,840
看起来有点破旧
are startin' to look a little ragged.

492
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,220
啊，我们会尽力的
Ah, we'll see what we can do.

493
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,000
委员会下周要开会
Committee's meeting next week.

494
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,230
赢得越多通常意味着校友资助就越多
More wins usually means more money from the alumni.

495
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,350
当然
Sure.

496
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,520
我们的小伙子们怎么样了，教练？
So, how are our boys doing, Coach?

497
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,660
现在说还为时尚早，但很可靠
Early to say, but solid.

498
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,900
哦，他们一直在努力训练
Oh, they've been workin' hard.

499
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,110
我儿子，波，他们整个休赛期
My boy, Bo, had 'em training

500
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,540
－都在训练　－嗯
- all off season. - Hmm.

501
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,430
我认为他们今年会向加州大学发起真正的冲击
Think they're gonna make a real run at Cal this year.

502
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,790
我希望我们能做到
I hope we can.

503
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,700
我们也有一个不错的初级队在训练，你应该...
We got a good junior boat to push 'em, too. You should...

504
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,320
如果可以在我们这挂上横幅，而不是让加州大学
It'd be nice to finally hang a banner up at our place

505
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,800
把它们都拿走，那就太好了
instead of letting Cal have 'em all.

506
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,380
我们会尽力的，先生
We'll do our best, sir.

507
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,300
还有一枚奥运奖牌可以拼一拼
And an Olympic medal to go with it.

508
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,100
波说他们队有机会
Bo says his boat's got a shot.

509
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,690
如果我们加把劲
If we work hard.

510
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,250
并取得一些突破
And catch some breaks.

511
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,700
教练，人生的突破都是赢家自己创造的
Winners make our own breaks in life, Coach.

512
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,670
我们需要这个
And we need this.

513
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,560
机不可失，时不再来
It's now or never.

514
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,490
嗯
Hmm.

515
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,250
如果我们这些影子冒犯了你
If we shadows have offended

516
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,880
那么只需想象，这一切都是梦境
Think but this, and all is mended.

517
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,280
你只是在这里打了个盹...
That you have but slumbered here...

518
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,580
而这些幻象就出现了
While these visions did appear.

519
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,540
谢谢
Thank you.

520
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,290
是一个叫莎士比亚的，对吗？
It's some fella called Shakespeare, right?

521
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,830
你知道，搞音乐的
You know, music people

522
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,600
他们应该收拾好自己的垃圾
should have to take care of their own trash.

523
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,130
比昨晚自助餐厅好多了
Better than the cafeteria last night.

524
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,060
我是说，天哪，我今天差点吃不下饭
I mean, God, I almost couldn't eat today.

525
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,550
你看到那些食物了吗，都被弄成那样了？
You see that old food, all mushed around like that?

526
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,000
你有没有注意到女孩们的桌子下面
You ever notice how under the girls' tables,

527
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,340
总是最糟糕的？
it's always the worst?

528
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,880
你仔细看，女孩们都很邋遢
When you look close, girls are nasty.

529
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,590
你没发现，只是因为她们穿着漂亮的裙子
You don't realize it 'cause of their nice dresses

530
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,220
头发都梳得好好的
and their hair's all fixed up.

531
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,900
但我宁愿清理10个男孩的桌子下面，也不...
But I'll clean under 10 boys' tables before I do one...

532
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,560
哦，唐，还有什么是你不会的吗？
Oh, Don, there anything you can't do?

533
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,030
继续弹啊
Keep goin'.

534
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,550
我们玩得开心吗？
Ain't we got fun?

535
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,000
房租还没付呢，亲爱的
The rent's unpaid, dear

536
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,610
我们没有车
We haven't a car

537
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,120
无论如何，亲爱的
In any way, dear

538
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,750
我们乐天知命
We'll stay as we are

539
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,190
即使我们欠杂货店老板的钱
Even if we owe the grocer

540
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,330
我们玩得开心吗？
Ain't we got fun?

541
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,500
莫里斯在兰茨身后的六号位怎么样？
What about Morris in the six behind Rantz

542
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,840
让亨特在一号位？
and Hunt in the one?

543
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,430
我们上周试过了
We tried that last week.

544
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,310
我不知道
I don't know.

545
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,040
从纸面上看，这应该是可行的
On paper, this should work.

546
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,500
不止是可行
Better than just work.

547
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,660
你让他们和其他100个孩子进行单人比赛
You put them in singles against 100 other kids,

548
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,780
我敢打赌，前8名的选手都在这里
I'd bet on that being the top eight finishers out there.

549
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,000
这就是问题所在
That's the problem.

550
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,320
他们很难记住
They have a hard time remembering

551
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,170
他们不是在参加双桨比赛，尤其是兰茨
they aren't in sculls, especially Rantz.

552
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,750
他们是我在这里见过的
They're a strong a group as I've ever seen

553
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,800
最强大的队伍
come through here

554
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,450
他们可能也是我见过的最糟糕的艇员
and they might also be the worst crew I've ever seen.

555
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,430
这是一个糟糕的组合
It's a bad mix.

556
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,640
是我的错
It's my fault.

557
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,750
也许这些名字并不是问题所在
Well, maybe those names aren't the problem.

558
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,320
有时，年轻的马匹需要一个声音更大的骑师
Sometimes young horses need a louder jockey.

559
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,180
－你想见我，教练？
- You wanted to see me, Coach?

560
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,900
关上门
Close the door.

561
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,420
坐下，鲍比
Sit down, Bobby.

562
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,310
你知道我为什么叫你来吗？
You know why I called you here?

563
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,630
我猜你需要有人帮你打败加州大学
My guess is you need someone to help you beat Cal.

564
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,440
我来给你解释一下
Let me explain something to you.

565
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,580
我给你第二次机会
I'm giving you a second chance.

566
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,850
你要来驾驶初级队的艇
You're gonna drive the JV boat.

567
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,400
－初级队？－没错
- JV? - Yeah, that's right.

568
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,810
现在，听我说
Now, listen to me.

569
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,630
我让你做什么你就得做什么
You're gonna do what I tell you, when I tell you.

570
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,180
如果我看到你还是一意孤行，你就出局了
And if I see you goin' off on your own, then you're out.

571
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,480
这次是永远，你明白吗？
For good this time. You understand?

572
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,220
－明白　－好吧
- Yeah, I do. - All right.

573
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,480
出去吧
Get out.

574
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:06,920
来吧
Come on!

575
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,510
你的手太高了
Your hands are too high!

576
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,820
解决入水问题
Fix the catch.

577
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,340
同时入水，我们走
One catch, let's go.

578
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,910
像个团队，伙计们
Look like a team, fellas.

579
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,830
蹬腿，抬头
Legs through, eyes up.

580
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,200
蹬腿
Legs through.

581
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,370
你们不同步，跟着休姆
You guys are out of sync. Find Hume.

582
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,520
跟着休姆的节奏
Take it off Hume.

583
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,450
注意桨片高度
Watch those blade heights.

584
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,920
嘿，兰兹，你和我们一起吗？跟着休姆的节奏
Hey, Rantz, you with us? Get with Hume.

585
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,710
蹬腿
Legs through.

586
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,680
蹬腿，来吧
Legs through. Come on!

587
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,330
戴，你入水太高了，低一点
Day, you're catching too high. Lower.

588
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,820
莫里斯，你迟了
Morris, you're late.

589
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,900
够了，停桨，停桨
Enough! Way-nuff! Way-nuff!

590
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,790
是啊，划得不错
Yeah, good ride.

591
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,310
我最喜欢的部分就是，当你们在不同时间入水的时候
And my favorite part is how my nuts vibrated

592
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,960
我的蛋蛋都被震飞起来了
when you guys were all hitting the water at different times.

593
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,560
我们慢得跟屎一样，但感觉很舒服
We were moving slow as shit, but the sensation was nice.

594
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,830
去你的，莫奇
Screw you, Moch.

595
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,460
不，花花公子，你要倒霉了
No, dandy, you're the one screwed.

596
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,800
教练告诉我，如果你们
Coach told me if you guys

597
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,200
不把自己的问题解决了
don't get yourselves figured out,

598
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,610
你不仅要错过下一场比赛
you're not only missing the regatta,

599
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,470
你们今年都不会参加比赛
you're not racing at all this year.

600
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,290
如果什么都不参加
That's a whole hell of a lot of work

601
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,720
那可真是无用功了
to just do nothing with.

602
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,030
那么，想再试一次吗？
So, feel like trying it again?

603
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,270
我准备好了
I'm ready.

604
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,260
很好
That's good.

605
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,180
总是顺着纹路
Always with the grain.

606
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,860
艇员们进展如何？
How's the crew coming along?

607
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,990
比我预想的要难得多
Lot harder than I expected.

608
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,490
这就是练习的目的
Well, that's what practice is for.

609
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,570
开赛前教练会把你们调整好的
Coaches will have you ready for the regatta.

610
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,020
你的家人会来吗？
Your folks gonna make it?

611
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,670
我妈妈在我很小的时候就去世了
My mother, she passed when I was young.

612
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,530
而我爸爸，他几年前就搬走了
And my pop, he had to move off

613
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,720
为了工作
several years ago to find work.

614
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,790
失联了
Kinda lost touch.

615
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,550
谁把你养大的？
Who brought you up?

616
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,040
爸爸觉得我一个人没问题
Pop figured I was okay on my own.

617
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,410
嗯
Hmm.

618
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,940
你当时多大？
How old were you?

619
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,760
差不多14.
Almost 14.

620
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,070
他和我继母
Him and my stepmom,

621
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,470
他们有两个年幼的儿子需要照顾
they had two young boys to care for.

622
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,170
塞奎姆附近没有工作
There was no work around Sequim.

623
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,580
这样对大家都好
Worked out best for everybody.

624
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,530
蹬腿
Legs through.

625
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,430
蹬腿
Legs through.

626
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,310
蹬腿
Legs through.

627
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,300
蹬腿，放松肩膀
Legs through. Soften the shoulders.

628
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,630
抬头
Eyes up.

629
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,730
保持放松
Stay loose.

630
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,900
肩膀放低，乔
Shoulders down, Joe.

631
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,090
放低
Stay low.

632
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,010
放松
Stay loose.

633
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,480
抬头
Eyes up.

634
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,440
好点了吗？
Better?

635
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,770
同步
As one.

636
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,640
同步
As one.

637
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,650
同步
As one.

638
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,590
把压力给到脚踏板上
Put the pressure in the footplate.

639
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,050
推进
Drive!

640
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,930
推进
Drive!

641
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,820
她来了，孩子们
Here she is, boys.

642
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,820
也许这是乔治有史以来最出色的杰作
Maybe the finest George has ever made.

643
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,190
现在，这就是你的新家
Now, this is your new home.

644
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,940
好好对待她
Treat her that way.

645
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,210
照顾她，保护她
Care for her. Protect her.

646
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,500
最重要的是，你最好尊重她
Most of all, you better respect her.

647
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,880
好了，穿戴整齐，出发吧
All right, suit up and get out there.

648
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,900
你们一周后要和加州大学比赛
You race against Cal in a week.

649
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,070
不会让你失望的，教练
Won't let you down, Coach.

650
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,920
欢迎来到美丽的华盛顿湖畔

653
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,160
和过去30年一样
And just as it has been for the past 30 years, 

654
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,980
两英里长的比赛将从沙角开始

直到谢里登海滩

我们这里聚集了10万名赛艇迷来观看
We have 100,000 race fans gathered here

657
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,220
这肯定是一场自新奥尔良比赛以来
for what is sure to be another maritime battle

658
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,410
我们从未见过的海上战斗
the likes of which we haven't seen since New Orleans.

身穿紫金战袍的华盛顿哈士奇队主教练
And in the purple and gold, Washington Huskies coach,

和一艘没有经验的初级艇
and an inexperienced junior boat, 

662
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,340
希望扭转上个赛季的糟糕表现
in hopes of reversing a devastating season last year.

663
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,180
毫无疑问，他面临着激烈的竞争
Without a doubt, he's facing stiff competition.

664
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,340
传奇教练凯・埃布莱特再次

带来了两艘强艇

他夸赞他的初级艇员为
He's called his junior crew

667
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,860
可能是他手下最优秀的年轻桨手

668
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,150
加油，华盛顿
Let's go, Washington!

669
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,250
嗨，罗杰

不要想太多做太多，听莫奇的指挥
Don't try and do too much. Listen to Moch.

671
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,280
跟紧点，我们希望加州队会犯错
Stay close, and we'll hope Cal makes a mistake.

672
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,920
身体保持冷静

673
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,380
举起手来...
Hold your hands up...

674
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,760
－鼓舞人心　－嗯？
- Inspiring. - Hmm?

675
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,110
呃，你没听到我告诉他们
Uh, you missed the part where I told 'em

676
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,050
尽量不要翻船的部分
just to try not to tip over.

677
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,510
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

678
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,840

距离比赛开始还有五分钟

681
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,490
有点不舒服，艾尔
a little under the weather, Al.

682
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,340
希望你对我们客气点
I hope you take it easy on us.

683
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,770
就算我想相信你也不行，凯
Not even if I believed you, Ky.

684
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,010
两队都已就位
Both teams are in position.

685
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,640
风从北面吹来，时速五英里
Winds are out of the north at five miles an hour.

686
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,400
气温为温和的71华氏度
The temperature is a mild 71 degrees.

687
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,250
好了，大伙，都听到乌尔布里克森说的了
All right, boys. You heard Ulbrickson.

688
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,960
跟近一点，希望他们会犯错
Stick close and hope they make a mistake.

689
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,400
他的意思是别让他难堪
That's his way of saying don't embarrass him

690
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,080
因为他认为你们会让他难堪的
'cause that's what he thinks you're gonna do.

691
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,570
我说都见鬼去吧
I say the hell with all that.

692
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,740
这些人不是来看你们跟近一点的
All these people didn't just come to see you stick close.

693
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,330
我们要让乌尔布里克森看看这艘艇上的都是谁
Let's show Ulbrickson what's in this boat.

694
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,940
准备好了吗？
Ready?

695
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,710
桨手们已经准备就绪
The oarsmen are at the ready.

696
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,280
开始

00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,720
他们出发了！
And they're off!

Tonight is your best shot.

842
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,780
你继续，我想我没事
You go on. I think I'm okay.

843
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,810
看在上帝的份上
Christ sake.

844
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,330
嘿，听好了
Hey, listen up!

845
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,220
我们中间有一位音乐家
We got a musician in our midst.

846
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,890
稍加鼓励
With a little encouragement,

847
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,640
可能会让他给我们带来一些现场音乐
we might just get him to give us some live music.

848
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,960
唐・休姆
Don Hume!

849
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,980
快上来，快上来
Get up here. Get up here.

850
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,030
来吧，唐！
Come on, Don!

851
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,630
不，不
No. No.

852
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,030
－嘿，小心点　－不，不，不
- Hey, watch out. - No, no, no, no, no.

853
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,880
鲍比，拿凳子来
Bobby, get the stool.

854
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:32,630
钢琴师
The piano man.

855
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,770
约翰，约翰，约翰
John, John, John

856
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,930
－不，不，不　－到了
- No, no, no. - There we go.

857
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,180
一切准备就绪，大师.
All ready for you there, maestro.

858
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,240
让我们为唐鼓掌！
Let's hear it for Don!

859
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,270
唐・休姆
Don Hume.

860
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,040
来吧，唐！
Come on, Don!

861
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,480
我们知道你能做到
We know you can do it.

862
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,730
－来吧，唐　－加油，唐尼
- Come on, Don. - Come on, Donnie.

863
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,510
我觉得我不应该在这
I don't think that I should be here.

864
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,410
他不能进来
He can't be in here.

865
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,770
闭嘴，卡洛琳
Oh, shut up, Carolyn.

866
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,870
上周我看见你在窗前抽烟
I saw you smoking at your window last week.

867
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,330
那边太吵了
It was too loud in there.

868
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,630
对，大家很快乐，他们玩得很开心
Yeah. People are happy. They're having fun.

869
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,810
对，因为你
Yeah, because of you.

870
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,170
好吧，我要换衣服了
Okay, I'm changing.

871
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,510
眼睛看着墙壁
Eyes on the wall.

872
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,900
好
Right.

873
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,380
你知道自己会赢吗？
Did you know you were gonna win?

874
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,570
不，我的手臂在颤抖
No. My arms, they were shaking.

875
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,940
我太紧张了
I was so nervous.

876
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,970
我们都在大声尖叫
We were all screaming so loud.

877
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,030
广播说这是有史以来最快的一次
The radio said it was the fastest ever.

878
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,940
对，教练是这么告诉我们的
Yeah, that's what Coach told us.

879
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,030
我打赌你们每场都能赢
I bet you win every race.

880
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,510
只要不自命不凡就好
Just don't get all stuck-up and everything.

881
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,750
我把它留着，以防再遇到你
I just kept that in case I ever ran into you again.

882
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,560
不得不...
And had to, um...

883
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,730
证明你暗恋过我，就像我说的那样
prove that you had that crush on me, like I said.

884
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,420
西姆达斯小姐，开门
Miss Simdars, open this door.

885
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,380
你...你该走了
You... You should go.

886
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,400
你该走了，你必须走了，你必须走了
You should go. You need to go. You need to go.

887
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,030
西姆达斯小姐，马上开门，小姐
Miss Simdars, open this door right now, young lady.

888
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,060
如果里面有男性访客
If you have a male visitor in there,

889
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:32,090
那么，你知道后果是什么
well, you know the consequences.

890
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,330
一分钟
One minute!

891
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,780
－什么　－太高了吗？
- What? - Is that too far?

892
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,270
－不　－那很好
- No. - You're fine.

893
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,340
西姆达斯小姐
Miss Simdars!

894
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,600
我们玩得开心吗？
Ain't we got fun?

895
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,710
收税员越来越近了
Tax collector's getting closer

896
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,890
尽管如此，我们还是很开心
Still, we got fun

897
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,080
没有比这更确定的了
There's nothing surer

898
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,180
富者愈富，穷者愈穷
The rich get rich and the poor get poorer

899
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,820
同时，此时
In the meantime, in between time

900
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,520
我们玩得开心吗？
Ain't we got fun?

901
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,130
干得好
Well done!

902
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,160
好，好
Okay! Yeah!

903
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,870
唐・休姆，女士们先生们
Don Hume, ladies and gentlemen.

904
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,760
－哈佛，耶鲁？－嗯
- Harvard, Yale? - Mm-hmm.

905
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,900
两队的成绩都是我们无法企及的
Both have put up times we haven't gotten close to.

906
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,500
通常就是这样
That's how it usually goes.

907
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:46,030
东部的孩子在会穿鞋之前就已经上艇了
Kids back East are in boats before they're in shoes.

908
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,310
学校有更多的人才可供选择
Schools just have more talent to choose from.

909
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,160
这就是钱能给你买到的
That's what money buys you.

910
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,320
我们需要点优势，汤姆
We need an edge, Tom.

911
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:32,010
划，破，划
Through. In and through.

912
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,480
破，划
In and through.

913
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,480
划
And through!

914
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,990
抬头
Eyes up!

915
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,550
破，划
In and through!

916
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,800
抬高
Stand tall.

917
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,320
蹬腿
Legs through.

918
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,320
破，划
In and through.

919
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,060
蹬腿
Legs through.

920
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,660
蹬腿
Legs through.

921
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,060
蹬腿
Legs through.

922
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,400
破，划
In, through.

923
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,240
破，划
In, through.

924
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,270
破，划
In, through.

925
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,040
破，划
In, through.

926
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,210
破，划
In, through.

927
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,060
破，划
In, through.

928
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,150
破，划
In and through.

929
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,980
蹬腿
Legs through.

930
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,280
蹬腿
Legs through.

931
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,530
停桨
Way-nuff!

932
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,960
其他人都累了，他们却越战越勇
Everybody else tires and they just get stronger.

933
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,410
这是他们第三次击败校队
That's the third time they beat the varsity squad.

934
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,640
也许下次就输了
Maybe next time.

935
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,810
我只是觉得风险太大了
I just think it's too big of a risk.

936
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,940
波基普西今年不仅仅是冠军赛
Poughkeepsie is more than just the championship this year.

937
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,130
也是奥运会选拔赛
It's for the Olympics.

938
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,410
我知道比赛意味着什么，汤姆
I know what the race means, Tom.

939
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,050
在大型比赛中，经验很重要
Experience counts for something in big races.

940
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,240
校队有一半人
Half those guys on varsity

941
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,530
去年在波基普西参加过比赛
competed at Poughkeepsie last year.

942
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,050
－他们输了　－他们今年更好
- And they lost. - They're better this year.

943
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,370
如果不知道他们的年龄
If you didn't know their ages,

944
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,160
不知道他们划了多久
you didn't know how long they've been rowing,

945
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,030
假设你第一次看到这两艘艇...
you're looking at both boats for the first time...

946
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:44,210
后院的计时赛不算
A time trial in the backyard does not count.

947
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,700
这和正规赛场是两码事
That is not the same thing as a race.

948
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,120
看看比赛时间
Look at the competition times.

949
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,640
没那么容易
It's not that easy.

950
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,610
拜托，你知道的
Come on, you know that.

951
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,620
是的，是的
Yes. Yes.

952
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:53,970
是的，我知道
Yes, I know.

953
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,840
你表现得就像校队是群废物一样
You're acting like the varsity boat is scrappin'.

954
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:58,130
要知道，那艘艇也没有输过比赛
You know that boat hasn't lost a race either.

955
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,640
就在不久前
And it wasn't that long ago

956
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,320
你还在期待初级队
you were just hopin' the JV boat

957
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,180
能在不沉没的情况下坚持到终点
was gonna make it to the finish line without sinking.

958
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,710
现在，艾尔
Now, Al,

959
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,530
现在你却说要把我们所有的筹码都押在他们身上
now you're talkin' about putting all our chips on 'em.

960
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,500
你认为校队能在柏林拿奖吗？
Do you think varsity could medal in Berlin?

961
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:09,990
我们不是在谈论奖牌
We're not talkin' about a medal.

962
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,450
我们说的是去那里的机会
We're talkin' about a shot at gettin' there.

963
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,230
就算他们到了那？
If they got there?

964
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,170
我不知道
I don't know.

965
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,690
我们今年需要一场胜利，艾尔
We need a win this year, Al.

966
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:33,380
给我们付钱的人，他们需要一场胜利
The people who pay us, they need a win.

967
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,320
你派一艇孩子过去
You send a boat full of kids down there

968
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,750
他们就会被绊倒
and they trip up,

969
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,740
你就等着
you're sticking your neck way out there.

970
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,690
引颈就戮吧，我也是
Makes it a real easy target. And mine, too.

971
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,970
我需要这份工作
I need this job.

972
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:02,910
你怎么看，乔治？
What do you think, George?

973
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:04,840
嗯
Hmm.

974
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,390
你在艇上那会
When you were in a boat,

975
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:15,120
你的划艇技术这里无人能及
you rowed like no one else that's ever come through here.

976
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,580
我记得我看着你
I remember watching you,

977
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,860
真想知道我的船到底能跑多快
wondering how fast one of my shells could go

978
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,920
如果里面有8个和你一样的人
if there were eight just like you in it.

979
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,080
那群孩子
That bunch of kids

980
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:27,730
可能是最接近我这想法的了
might be as close to that as I'll ever get.

981
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:33,330
如果我把他们派出去，他们还没准备好呢？
And if I send them out there and they aren't ready?

982
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,990
那就像汤姆说的那样
Then it's like Tom said.

983
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,540
斧头很可能会落下
The axe will likely fall,

984
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,030
砍得脖子疼
and fall hard.

985
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,510
现在你的口气开始像我妻子了
Now you're starting to sound like my wife.

986
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,310
海泽尔是个聪明的女人
Well, Hazel's a smart woman.

987
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,440
我就当你在夸我
I'll take that as a compliment.

988
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,480
大家早上好
Good morning, everybody.

989
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:58,660
谢谢
Thank you.

990
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:03,060
众所周知，波基普西帆艇赛
Now, as we all know, uh, the Poughkeepsie Regatta

991
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,860
一直是本赛季最重要的比赛
is always the most important race of the season.

992
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,110
今年，它的意义更加重大
This year, there's even more riding on it,

993
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:14,650
因为获胜者将获得奥运会的参赛资格
because the winner will qualify for an Olympic spot.

994
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,710
好
Yes!

995
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,910
它也是华盛顿大学已近20年
It's also a race that the University of Washington

996
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:27,480
未尝胜绩的一个赛事
has not won in almost two decades,

997
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,110
但是...
but... but...

998
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,580
我们今年有一艘艇
we have a boat this year

999
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,860
我相信他们可以改变这一切
that I believe could change all that.

1000
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:41,920
这艘艇不仅能在波基普西夺冠
A boat that could not only win at Poughkeepsie,

1001
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,730
而且
but

1002
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:46,260
有足够的实力在柏林一展身手
is strong enough to have a real shot in Berlin.

1003
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,470
还有...
And, uh...

1004
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,990
那艘艇就是我们的初级艇
that boat is our junior boat.

1005
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,660
是的，你们都听到了
Yeah, you heard me.

1006
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,880
听着，我知道这不合常理
Listen, I understand that that's unorthodox.

1007
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:20,270
－不合常理？简直是疯了　－我正在尽我所能...
- Unorthodox? It's insane. - I'm doing everything I can...

1008
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,460
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

1009
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:22,870
我们团队和华盛顿大学的
in the best interests of our team

1010
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,370
最佳利益
and the University of Washington.

1011
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,000
谢谢
Thank you.

1012
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,900
这简直是胡扯！
This is bullshit!

1013
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,050
你疯了吗？
Have you lost your mind?

1014
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,360
那些花了四年时间
What about those boys who spent

1015
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,890
在这上面的孩子怎么办？
the last four years working for this?

1016
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,430
我的工作就是派最好的艇去参赛，本
My job is to put the best boat in the water, Ben.

1017
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,320
你的工作？我付的钱
Your job? I pay for your job.

1018
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,870
没有我支持，你认为
Without the boosters, where do you think

1019
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,160
你们买艇的钱是从哪里来的？
the money for your boats comes from, huh?

1020
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,320
你那该死的薪水哪里来
For your goddamn salary?

1021
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,630
让我做我的工作怎么样？
How about you let me do my job?

1022
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,860
让我们安定下来
Let's just settle down

1023
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:53,760
冷静地谈谈，来吧
and talk about this calmly. Come on.

1024
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,240
没什么好谈的，杰伊
There's nothin' to talk about, Jay.

1025
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,770
我的团队，我做主
My team, my decision.

1026
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,640
那就不再是你的团队了
Then it's not your team anymore.

1027
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:00,330
我会让你屁股挪窝
I'll make sure your ass is fired

1028
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,570
在火车开往波基普西之前
before the train leaves for Poughkeepsie.

1029
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,050
－本，我们不会搞到...　－好吧
- Ben, we're not gonna get... - All right.

1030
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,670
博勒斯和你一样能干
Bolles is just as capable as you.

1031
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,730
甚至更好
Better even.

1032
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,370
我会和艾尔一样选择
I'd do the same as Al.

1033
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,830
我希望你知道自己在做什么
I hope you know what you're doing.

1034
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,950
本
Ben!

1035
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:28,220
我知道吗？
Do I?

1036
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,310
你当然知道
Sure you do.

1037
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,560
真不敢相信你要去参加奥运会
I can't believe you're going to the Olympics.

1038
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,180
我们得先打败其他学校
We gotta beat those other schools first,

1039
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,860
但教练说，我们的机会和其他队一样多
but Coach says we have as good a shot as anybody.

1040
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,350
你不准和那些纽约女孩调情
You can't flirt with any of those New York girls.

1041
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,760
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1042
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,570
马上回来
Be back in a second.

1043
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:06,830
乔？
Joe?

1044
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,340
在报纸上看到你的照片了
Saw your picture in the paper.

1045
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,900
小哈利把它剪了下来
Harry Junior clipped it out.

1046
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,920
你们什么时候从加州回来的？
When did you get back from California?

1047
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,350
好几年了
Couple of years.

1048
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,260
那里的情况也没好到哪里去
You know, things weren't much better down there.

1049
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,780
这么说，你一直都在这里？
So, you've been here all that time?

1050
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,070
就在前面一点点远
Down the road a bit.

1051
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,590
你打算告诉我吗？
Were you ever gonna tell me?

1052
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,320
你做得很好
You're doin' all right.

1053
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,780
你离开的时候，我才14岁
I was 14 when you left.

1054
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,040
我在那个年纪就上战场了
I went to war when I was that age.

1055
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,320
那么，你在想什么，乔？
So, what do you wanna do, Joe?

1056
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:13,720
啊？
Huh?

1057
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,040
想搬回家吗？
Move home?

1058
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,620
我是说，我需要人帮忙
I mean, I could use the help.

1059
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,260
这样吧，我每天付你一美元
Tell you what, I'll pay you a dollar a day

1060
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,390
如果你还记得如何砍树的话
if you still remember how to cut a tree.

1061
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,100
或者，你宁愿继续划你的艇
Or maybe you'd rather just keep rowing your boat.

1062
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,970
你不欠我什么，乔
You don't owe me a thing, Joe.

1063
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,570
我也不欠你的
I don't owe you.

1064
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,020
你做得很好
You're doing just fine.

1065
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,610
我会转达问候的
I'll pass on regards.

1066
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,500
对不起
I'm sorry.

1067
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:01,370
这结果是最好的
Works out for the best.

1068
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,580
是的，但这并不意味着就没事了
Yeah, but that doesn't make it okay.

1069
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,140
也许吧
Maybe.

1070
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,040
我得走了
I gotta go.

1071
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,640
你应该来睡一觉
You should come get some sleep

1072
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:09,770
在太阳升起之前
before the sun rises over that.

1073
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,110
我很快就过去
I'll be in there soon.

1074
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,880
我真喜欢这样的景色
I sure love that view.

1075
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,160
我知道
I know.

1076
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,330
我只是希望我能像以前那样享受它
I just wish I could enjoy it the way I used to.

1077
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,760
为什么不能
Why don't you

1078
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,300
要来看看有没有其他风景可以欣赏吗？
come see if there's another view you can enjoy?

1079
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,640
好吧
Okay.

1080
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,520
谢谢
Thank you.

1081
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:35,130
我们会成为世界上最快的艇员
We're gonna be the fastest crew the world has ever seen.

1082
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,070
把冠军带回家，艾尔
Bring home the championship, Al!

1083
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,200
－还有一枚金牌　－我们会努力的
- And a gold medal! - We'll try.

1084
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:41,330
哦，天哪
Oh, boy.

1085
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,280
我们可能想赢得比赛，对吧？
We might wanna try and win this thing, huh?

1086
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,240
没有压力
No pressure.

1087
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,240
－祝你们好运　－把奖牌带回家，孩子们
- Good luck! - Bring it home, boys!

1088
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:51,440
我会通过收音机收听
I'll be listening on the radio.

1089
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,740
如果他们采访你，跟我问个好
Say hello if they interview you.

1090
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,250
现在也许是个好机会
This might be a good time to tell you

1091
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,790
告诉你我爱上你了，乔
that I'm in love with you, Joe.

1092
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,870
好，我得走了
All right. I gotta go.

1093
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,770
嘿！
Hey! Hey!

1094
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,340
是的，她看着我
Yeah, she looked at me.

1095
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,640
兰茨
Rantz!

1096
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,950
我破产了，谁给我一便士
I'm busted. Someone give me a penny.

1097
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
幸运，我会让你看看的
Lucky, I'll let you watch.

1098
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,300
嘿，乔，把你的夹克给我
Hey, Joe, give me your jacket.

1099
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:37,850
这样我有一半押注的钱了
That'll get me halfway to ante.

1100
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,350
乔，别走
Joe, stick around.

1101
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,220
嘿，别走啊，流浪汉乔
Hey, don't run away, Hobo Joe.

1102
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,570
他开玩笑的
He's playin'.

1103
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:48,120
他开玩笑的，他开玩笑的
He's playin'. He's playin'.

1104
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,480
他开玩笑的
He's playin'.

1105
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,430
－天啊，查克　－开个玩笑而已
- Jesus, Chuck. - Was just jokin'.

1106
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:59,260
好吧，你的笑话太烂了
Yeah, well, your jokes are lousy.

1107
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,200
我没有别的意思
I didn't mean anything by it.

1108
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:45,450
事实是，我老爸几年前就破产了，所以...
Truth is, my old man went bust years ago, so...

1109
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,930
我穿的新衣服，都是从伍尔沃斯超市顺来的
Any new clothes I wear, I swipe from Woolworth's.

1110
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:52,450
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

1111
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,140
我只是说，我们并没有什么不同
Just sayin' we're not different.

1112
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:57,830
你和我
You and me.

1113
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,720
只不过你不是小偷
Except you're not a thief.

1114
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,020
一，停桨
One! Way-nuff!

1115
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,520
放下
Drop it.

1116
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,950
再来一次！节奏再快一点
Again! Need to get sharper.

1117
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,130
来吧
Come on.

1118
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,170
你们不同步，跟着休姆
You guys are out of sync. Find Hume.

1119
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,440
跟着休姆的节奏
Take it off Hume.

1120
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,170
像个团队，伙计们
Look like a team, fellas.

1121
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:32,530
同步
As one.

1122
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:33,710
你们不同步
You're out of sync.

1123
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,080
好吧，不，停桨
Okay, no, no. Way-nuff.

1124
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:39,190
我们要去哪里？嘿，乔，你和我们在一起吗？
Where are we off? Hey, Joe, you with us?

1125
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,910
－我　－对，锁定唐的节奏
- Me? - Yeah, lock in on Don.

1126
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:42,650
你在说什么？我不是问题所在
What are you talkin' about? I'm not the problem.

1127
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,390
再来一次
Go again.

1128
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,000
来吧
Come on.

1129
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,410
破，划
In and through.

1130
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:49,840
破，划
In and through.

1131
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,740
好吧，再来三桨，三
All right, give me three more. Three,

1132
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,140
二
two,

1133
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,930
一，停桨
one. Way-nuff!

1134
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,360
这样我们肯定能拿到第六名
That'd get us a solid sixth.

1135
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:01,730
这是新水域，他们还没适应
It's new water, they're still getting comfortable.

1136
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,460
第一轮还比较快
First times were faster.

1137
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:04,600
他们越来越不协调了
They're getting less comfortable.

1138
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,770
怎么回事？
What is the matter?

1139
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,690
还没协调好，我会带好他们的，教练
Not in tune yet. I'll get 'em there, Coach.

1140
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,690
让我们在赛前先协调好吧，鲍比
Let's do it before the race, Bobby.

1141
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:11,980
再来一次
Go again.

1142
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,760
好了，伙计们，左舷，退后
All right, fellas. Port side, back it down.

1143
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:16,170
右舷，打开，准备好了吗？
Starboard, tap on. Ready?

1144
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,010
可能是紧张
Probably nervous.

1145
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,400
他们只是孩子，艾尔
They're just kids, Al.

1146
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,420
这就是为什么大家都告诉我
That's why everybody told me

1147
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,070
我不该带他们来
I was wrong for bringin' them.

1148
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:30,570
我没有本钱再让他们孩子气下去了
I just can't afford for them to be kids.

1149
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,290
现在不一样了
Not anymore.

1150
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,840
－看起来他们...　－我知道问题在哪了
- It looks like they... - I know what's wrong.

1151
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,410
带进来
Bring it in.

1152
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,160
你们完美地划了500米
You have 500 perfect meters.

1153
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,440
然后另外500米，看起来就像
And then another five, where it looks like

1154
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:21,730
你们在划8条不同的艇
you're rowing eight different boats.

1155
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,120
时间就是有点对不上
The timing's just a little off.

1156
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,230
乔，你的心思在哪里呢，孩子？
Joe, where is your head at, son?

1157
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,680
－在艇上　－不，不在
- It's in the boat. - No, it's not.

1158
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,040
你在跟着自己的节奏走
You're setting your own pace.

1159
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,550
你的入水高于其他人
Your catch is higher than the rest.

1160
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,150
－我想...　－别打断我
- I'm trying to... - Don't interrupt me.

1161
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,650
你就像在单人划艇一样
You're rowing like you're in a single.

1162
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,560
我们已经训练太久了，不可能忘记
We've been doing this too goddamn long to forget

1163
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,490
你是在一个8人艇上
you're in an eight-man shell.

1164
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,220
现在，你想在艇上吗？
Now, do you wanna be in the boat

1165
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,400
还是我让别人来坐你的位子？
or am I'm gonna put someone else in your seat?

1166
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,450
我不在乎
I don't care.

1167
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,540
科伊
Coy!

1168
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,560
你坐在兰茨的位置上
You're in Rantz's seat.

1169
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,350
滚出去，你不在乎？滚出去
Get out. You don't care? Get out.

1170
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,620
科伊，来吧，我们走
Coy, come on, let's go.

1171
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,950
看来你明天要参加比赛了
Looks like you're racin' tomorrow.

1172
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,350
现在，也许我们可以像一个团队一样划了
Now, maybe we can row as a team.

1173
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,500
去和教练谈谈，告诉他你想回去
And just go talk to Coach, tell him you want back in.

1174
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,280
我不会求他把我的位置还给我的
I'm not beggin' him to give my place back.

1175
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,850
－我受够了　－你要去哪儿？
- I'm done with that. - Where you gonna go?

1176
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,150
你的钱又不够买张火车票
Ain't like you got money enough for a train ticket.

1177
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,510
我会想办法的，我一向如此
I'll figure somethin' out. I always have.

1178
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,340
你要在波基普西找个车住进去吗？
Are you gonna live in a car in Poughkeepsie?

1179
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,200
你好，罗杰，你好，乔
Hello, Roger. Hello, Joe.

1180
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,780
我需要在“赫斯基快艇”上再涂一层漆
I need to put another coat on the Husky Clipper.

1181
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,560
需要人帮忙
I could use a hand.

1182
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,760
我爷爷会让我帮他造的船上油
My grandfather would let me help oil the shells he built.

1183
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:06,590
大多数人讨厌它是因为有味道
Most hate it because of the smell.

1184
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,820
我一闻到鲸油的味道，立刻就听到了他的声音
I catch the scent of whale oil and immediately hear his voice

1185
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,330
告诉我“继续涂”
telling me to, "Keep putting it on"

1186
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,760
直到你能从反光中看到你脸上的雀斑
until you can see your freckles in the reflection.

1187
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:18,070
这样我才知道它又好又滑
That's how I'd know it was good and slick.

1188
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,630
这样，它就能像刀刃一样划过水面
So it would cut through the water like a knife blade.

1189
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,870
划得再快也没用
How it didn't matter how fast someone rowed

1190
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,260
如果水不是以完全正确的方式
if the water didn't flow across the hull

1191
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,100
流过船体
in the exact right way.

1192
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,320
如果重量没有恰到好处地平衡
If the weight wasn't balanced just right.

1193
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:38,300
每一部分都要相互配合
Every piece working with the other.

1194
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,390
艇员也是一样
It's the same with the crew.

1195
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,520
以至于两者之间真的没有什么区别
So much that there's really no difference between the two.

1196
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:54,080
他们因一起度过的所有时光而团结在一起
They're connected by all the hours spent together.

1197
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,510
汗水和痛苦
Sweat and pain

1198
01:16:57,050 --> 01:17:00,320
洇湿了艇身的纹理，它们变成了在水面上穿梭的
bleeds into the grain as they become one magical thing

1199
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,540
一个神奇的东西
that moves across the water

1200
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,840
就像天生就不属于任何地方一样
like it was born to be nowhere else.

1201
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,370
我造过很多好船，但最好的艇
I've built a lot of good boats, but the best ones,

1202
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:14,610
每一个部件都完全吻合的艇
the boats where every part fits exactly as it should,

1203
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,340
每一个人都信任他身后的人的艇
where every man trusts the one behind him,

1204
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,840
才是人们永远铭记的艇
they are the boats people remember forever.

1205
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,400
这就是这艘艇可能成为的样子
That's what this boat could be.

1206
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,280
看看这艘所有部件都完美配合的艇能跑多快
Be a shame for anyone to miss

1207
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,930
如果有人错过了，那就太可惜了
seeing how fast it could go with all the right pieces.

1208
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:39,060
乔，你爸爸放弃了你，他放弃了你
Joe, your dad gave up on you. He quit on you.

1209
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,120
你就只会放弃
All you know is quitting.

1210
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,860
但在我看来，你不是他
But it seems to me you're not him.

1211
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,120
或者你是？
Or are you?

1212
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,250
－是的　－是的，非常好
- Yes. - Yes, it's very nice.

1213
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,830
如果你们两个能站在一起的话
If I can get you two to just stand together.

1214
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,510
再来一张，完美
Just for one. And perfect.

1215
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,490
我们那边见
I'll, uh, see you over there.

1216
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:14,290
我能为你做什么，乔？
What can I do for you, Joe?

1217
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,220
我想要回我的位置
I want my seat back.

1218
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,470
为什么？
Why?

1219
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,410
我在里面度过的那些时光
All that time I spent in it,

1220
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:26,610
我们一起付出的努力
the work we all did together...

1221
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,450
那艘艇...
That boat...

1222
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,060
是我的全部
it's all I got.

1223
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:37,030
伙计们和...
The boys and...

1224
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,450
我只有这些了
It's all I got.

1225
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,960
我不能失去
I can't lose that.

1226
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,880
我对你们说的第一件事就是
You know, one of the first things I said to you boys was

1227
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,180
如果你的身体承受不了，这并不丢人
there's no shame if your body can't hold up to this.

1228
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,520
精神也是一样
The same goes for the mind.

1229
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,440
听着，我知道要信任那条艇上的每一个人
Listen, I know it isn't easy to trust every other person

1230
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,420
就像信任自己一样，并不容易
on that boat as much as you trust yourself.

1231
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,760
但这与你无关
But it's not about you.

1232
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,770
虽然你很优秀，但这不是你一个人的事情，乔
As good as you are, it's not about you, Joe,

1233
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,570
或者我，或其他任何一个人
or me, or anybody else.

1234
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,180
这是关于艇的
It's about the boat.

1235
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,030
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

1236
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:21,130
这是我想去的地方
It's where I wanna be.

1237
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,430
好的
Okay.

1238
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,200
你最好穿上队服
Well, you better get dressed.

1239
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,300
谢谢
Thank you.

1240
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,270
真的，谢谢你
Really, thank you.

1241
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,670
今天的帆艇赛
Today's regatta

1242
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,700
它既是一场比赛，也是一场社会实验
is as much a social experiment as it is a race.

1243
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,360
一场富有精英
A clash of character.

1244
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,790
和平头百姓的角色冲突
Of old money versus no money at all.

1245
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:57,410
六艘生活之艇对上一艘生存之艇
Six boats of want-to's against one filled with have-to's.

1246
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,900
这九个工人阶级男孩从美国西部来到这里
These nine working-class boys arrived from the American West

1247
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:01,970
肩负着一个国家的重任，这个国家从他们
on the shoulders of a country that sees itself

1248
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:03,670
坚定的年轻面孔中看到了自己
in their determined young faces.

1249
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,610
看到他们的奋斗，勇气和精神
Sees their struggles, their grit, their spirit.

1250
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:08,230
他们将“赫斯基快艇号”视作自身
And they've claimed the Husky Clipper as their own.

1251
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,800
因为艇上都是弱者
Because it's a boat full of underdogs

1252
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,530
代表一个弱势民族
representing an underdog nation.

1253
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,520
一个被打倒
A nation of people who have been beaten down

1254
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,040
但拒绝离开的民族

你们必须咬死他们

1269
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,370
只要你们在两个长度范围以内
As long as you're within two lengths,

1270
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,080
－就保持在30拍　－你的肩膀怎么样了？

哈士奇队能做到吗？他们能做到吗？
Can the Huskies do it? Can they do it?

1390
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:49,670
来10个大的
Give me 10 big ones

1391
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:52,160
给所有不相信你的人！
for all the people who didn't believe in you!

1392
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:53,400
冲
Go!

1393
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,710
给我拿下加州队！
Give me Cal!

1394
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,100
拿下加州队
I want Cal!

1395
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,620
对，我们要赢了，喔
Yeah, we're workin'! Whoo!

1396
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,430
他们正在前进
They're making their move!

1397
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,490
孩子们，加油
Boys, come on.

1398
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:08,930
蹬腿！
Legs through!

1399
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,430
还剩200米
With 200 meters left, 

1400
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,050
华盛顿正在超越加州
Washington is passing Cal!

1401
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:17,320
华盛顿正在超越加州
Washington is passing Cal!

1402
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,720
破，划
In, through!

1403
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,550
抬头
Eyes up!

1404
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:26,040
还有100米，华盛顿就要赢了！
With 100 meters to go, Washington is going to do it!

1405
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,040
华盛顿要赢了
Washington is going to do it!

1406
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,610
划，破，划
Through! In and through!

1407
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:34,030
－抬头，破　－来吧
- Eyes up! In! - Come on.

1408
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:42,100
华盛顿赢得了比赛，各位！
Washington has won the race, folks!

1409
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,550
华盛顿赢得了比赛！
Washington has won the race!

1410
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:47,470
华盛顿赢了！
Washington has won!

1411
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:06,550
多么精彩的比赛
What a race!

1412
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,150
教练乌尔布里克森的豪赌得到了回报
Coach Ulbrickson's big gamble has paid off, 

1413
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,210
女士们，先生们
ladies and gentlemen.

1414
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,690
华盛顿哈士奇队
The Washington Huskies

1415
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:14,400
要去柏林争夺金牌了
are going to Berlin to compete for gold.

1416
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,010
－真是一场精彩的比赛　－是的！
- What a race indeed! - Yes!

1417
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,670
哦...
Oh...

1418
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,810
我真的很喜欢你的笑容
I do love your smile.

1419
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:23,140
你应该经常笑一笑
You should do it more often.

1420
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,650
我们成功了，孩子们！
We did it, boys!

1421
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:36,260
我觉得你是想让我们都得心脏病
I think that you were trying to give us all a heart attack.

1422
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:38,270
不到万不得已，我不想打破他们的节奏
I just didn't want to break their rhythm till I had to.

1423
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,840
我真的不知道
I honest to God didn't know

1424
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,980
全世界有这么多的虾
there were this many shrimp in the entire world.

1425
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,720
您是否介意与我们的听众分享一下
Do you mind sharing with our listeners,

1426
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,960
在艇上的感觉如何
what was the feeling in the boat

1427
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:45,210
在你们落后四个艇位的时候？
when you were four lengths back?

1428
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,620
有没有恐慌？
Was there any panic?

1429
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,220
没有恐慌
Uh, there was no panic.

1430
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:52,480
我们所有人
All of us,

1431
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,720
我们都知道我们可以在需要的时候到位
we knew we could make up the ground when we needed to.

1432
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,280
如果可以的话
And, if I could,

1433
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:58,940
我能跟我的乔伊斯打个招呼吗？
could I say hello to my girl Joyce back home?

1434
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,620
等我回来就让你戴上金牌
I'll let you wear the gold medal when I get back.

1435
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:03,490
没错，各位
That's right, folks.

1436
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:05,210
他们将把金牌带回家
They'll be bringing the gold medal home

1437
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,790
为了我们所有华盛顿人
for all of us back in Washington.

1438
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:07,870
哦
Oh.

1439
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:09,920
这太棒了
This is great.

1440
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,900
你们是什么时候知道的？
So, you guys all knew about it when?

1441
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,420
我今晚才听到？
And I'm hearing about it tonight?

1442
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:14,910
你知道这听起来像什么吗？
You know what this sounds like to me?

1443
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,820
听起来你们好像在改变规则
It sounds like you guys are changing the rules

1444
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:18,630
因为你想从我们这里偷走这个
because you're trying to steal this from us.

1445
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,780
没有人想偷什么，乌尔布里克森教练
No one is trying to steal anything, Coach Ulbrickson.

1446
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:22,930
我只是和你谈谈
I'm just speaking to you

1447
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,130
以美国赛艇奥林匹克主席的身份
as the U.S. Rowing Olympic Chairman

1448
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,400
告诉你这个事实
and telling you the facts.

1449
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:28,240
美国赛艇协会没有钱
U.S. Rowing does not have the money

1450
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,890
来资助您的柏林之旅
to fund your trip to Berlin.

1451
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,250
这怎么可能呢？
And how is that even possible?

1452
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:32,410
不仅仅是划艇
It's not just rowing.

1453
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,060
游泳，击剑
Swimming, fencing.

1454
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,720
还有许多其他体育运动也在面对...
There are many other sports that are dealing with...

1455
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,750
我们到底需要出多少钱？
Exactly how much are we supposed to come up with?

1456
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,970
－5000美金　－5000？
- $5,000. - Five?

1457
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:44,950
－一周内？　－一周内
- In a week? - In a week.

1458
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:46,740
如果我们拿不出来呢？
And what if we can't come up with it?

1459
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,130
委员会不得不去找
Well, the committee would have to find

1460
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:50,010
合适的接替者去柏林比赛
a suitable replacement to compete in Berlin.

1461
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:51,660
谁合适，亨利？像你的宾大队？
Suitable like who, Henry? Like your Penn squad?

1462
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,950
如果有必要，可以
If necessary, yes.

1463
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:56,630
我们当然首先会给加州队一个机会
We'd of course give California the first opportunity.

1464
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,660
无论派哪支队去
Either team is a better option

1465
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:00,020
总比不派队好
than not sending a team at all.

1466
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,000
这是废话，亨利，都是胡扯
This is bullshit, Henry. It's bullshit.

1467
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,310
你没想到我们会赢，但我们赢了
You didn't expect us to win, and we won.

1468
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:06,830
是啊，你们不可能在水上赢我们，你们谁也赢不了
Yeah, you couldn't win on the water. None of you.

1469
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:07,970
我不喜欢这种情况
I don't like this situation.

1470
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:09,630
－现在，你在胡编乱造　－胡说八道
- Now, you're makin' up the rules. - Bullshit.

1471
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:10,670
我也不喜欢这种情况
I don't like the situation

1472
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:12,300
－和你一样　－你当然不喜欢
- any more than you do. - Yeah, sure you don't.

1473
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:14,410
－胡说八道　－我们会解决的
- Bullshit. - We'll figure this out.

1474
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,390
我们怎么能拿出5000美元呢？
How are we supposed to come up with $5,000?

1475
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:24,490
我们大学将与校友和支持者联系
Our university will reach out to alumni and boosters.

1476
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:26,830
看看他们能不能支持一点
See if they can scrape anything up.

1477
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,850
如果他们的资助也不够呢？
And if they can't find enough?

1478
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,430
那就会是加州大学队
Then it'd be Cal

1479
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:33,180
或宾州大学队去了
or Penn.

1480
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,740
我们打败了那些家伙
We beat those guys.

1481
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,630
我知道
I know.

1482
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:39,200
我们绝不能让那些有钱的混蛋代替我们去
No way we let those rich pricks go instead of us.

1483
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,730
那我们最好找点钱出来
Then we better find some money.

1484
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:43,490
是啊
Yeah.

1485
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:50,680
艾尔，你去哪儿？
Al, where you goin'?

1486
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,370
帮助将哈士奇队送往柏林
Help send the Huskies to Berlin.

1487
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:08,590
谢谢，祝您愉快
Thank you. You have a nice day.

1488
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,980
－谢谢　－好的
- Thank you, sir. - Sure.

1489
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,310
嘿，伙计们
Hey, guys.

1490
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,070
奥运赛艇队需要您的帮助才能到达柏林
The Olympic rowing team needs your help to get to Berlin.

1491
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:14,470
我们只剩下几天时间了
We only got a couple days left.

1492
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,980
伙计们，我有一块钱
Fellas, I got a dollar.

1493
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:18,690
捐助几块钱，帮助我们打败德国人
Spare a couple dollars. Help us beat the Germans.

1494
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,190
好的
All right.

1495
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:25,630
谢谢，我叫罗杰
Thanks. My name's Roger.

1496
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:26,740
嘿，我是查克
Hey, I'm Chuck.

1497
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:27,860
哦，拜托
Oh, please.

1498
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,870
好吧，你的时间不多了，教练
Well, you're running out of days, Coach.

1499
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,050
－你还缺多少，4000？　－3000
- You have what, four left? - Three.

1500
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:34,750
我们的资金才募集到了
And we've only gotten halfway

1501
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,920
奥委会说的一半
to what the Olympic Committee says we need.

1502
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:38,250
所以，如果你筹不足钱
So, if you don't raise the money, 

1503
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,710
你们就得回西雅图去
you go back to Seattle

1504
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,210
与此同时，其他队会去柏林？
while some other team goes to Berlin?

1505
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,720
正确，这有悖于
Correct. And that goes against

1506
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,420
一切体育精神
everything sports should be about.

1507
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:47,090
运动员应该因为表现而得到奖励
Athletes should be rewarded for performance.

1508
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:48,240
不搞政治
No politics,

1509
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:50,320
不搞加分，或者
no adjusted scoring or selection

1510
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:52,260
基于财富和地位来选人
based on wealth and standing.

1511
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:53,960
让最优秀的人获胜
May the best man win.

1512
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,940
他们是这么说的，就应该是这样
That's what they say. That's what it should be.

1513
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,710
这些孩子，华盛顿的孩子
These boys, Washington's boys,

1514
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,650
这个国家的孩子
this country's boys,

1515
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:01,970
我的孩子
my boys,

1516
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:05,100
他们已经证明了自己是最棒的
they have proven themselves to be the best.

1517
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:10,070
帮助我们将哈士奇队送往柏林
Help us send the Huskies to Berlin.

1518
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:12,180
提醒各位，一点一滴都是帮助
A reminder, folks, every little bit helps.

1519
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:13,540
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

1520
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:14,700
来吧，支持我们的孩子
Come on, support our boys.

1521
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,070
好的，非常感谢
All right. Thank you so much.

1522
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:18,310
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

1523
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:20,910
非常感谢，谢谢
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1524
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:42,280
我们从塔科马募集了92美元，以罗杰・莫里斯之名

你真的是世界上跑得最快的人吗？

1606
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:03,100
给德国人点厉害瞧瞧，好吗？

1607
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,690
－不　－不
- No. - No?

1608
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,100
不是给德国人
Not the Germans.

1609
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,290
是给家乡的父老乡亲的
The folks back home.

1610
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,830
美利坚合众国

And here come the Americans.

1614
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:31,690
美国没有敬礼

1615
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:35,540
听起来孩子们正在交朋友

1616
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,320
好了，起风了
All right, the winds are up.

1617
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,260
这对我们有好处，你们在第二道不受直接影响
That's good for us. You're protected in lane two.

1618
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,310
让其他更远的船
Let all the other boats farther out

1619
01:39:46,330 --> 01:39:47,630
去对付阵风吧
deal with the gusts.

1620
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,150
鲍比，你越是紧守
Bobby, the tighter you hold the line,

1621
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:51,480
比赛就越平稳
the smoother the ride.

1622

1624
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:59,110
这就是你们想要的，休息一天
That is what you want. You want a day off

1625
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:00,840
让其他球队疲于奔命
and let the other teams wear themselves out

1626
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,040
多赛一场
with an extra race.

1627
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:03,570
所以，不要保留
So, do not hold back.

1628
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,700
英国队是我们这组值得关注的队伍
Great Britain's the team to watch in our heat.

1629
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:08,580
鲍比，别再来波基普西那招了
Bobby, not another Poughkeepsie.

1630
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:10,250
它们不会像加州队那样后程乏力的
They won't fade like Cal,

1631
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,010
所以绝不能让他们领先超过两个艇位
so never let them get more than two lengths up.

1632
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,210
伙计们，这是你们应得的
Fellas, you've earned this.

1633
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:17,590
他们不会为风格颁发金牌
They don't give gold medals for style.

1634
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:20,260
唯一重要的是你们在水上的速度有多快
All that matters is how fast you are on the water.

1635
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,670
这里没人比你们更快
And nobody here is faster.

1636
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,410
蹬腿！
Legs through!

1637
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:35,670
美国人已经领先
And the Americans are already leading

1638
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,230
大不列颠半个艇位
by half a boat over Great Britain

1639
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:38,740
优势还在变大
and looking for more.

1640
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,920
法国和捷克斯洛伐克紧随其后
Followed by France and Czechoslovakia.

1641
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,540
破，划！破，划！
In, through! In, through!

1642
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,380
领桨员冉・劳里

1643
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:52,880
正在疯狂地挖掘英国艇的速度

1644
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:54,230
但是美国人

1645
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,340
现在正在大举进攻，扩大领先优势
are pouring it on now, extending their lead.

1646
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:59,280
抬头，破，划
Eyes up. In, through!

1647
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:01,140
划
And through!

1648
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,160
只剩100米了
And with only 100 meters to go, 

1649
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,260
美国人可能正在接近奥运会纪录
the Americans could be closing in on an Olympic record.

1650
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,430
抬头
Eyes up!

1651
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:13,310
6分8秒
Six minutes point eight seconds.

1652
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:14,950
新的奥运纪录！
A new Olympic record!

1653
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,690
美国赢了！
The United States has won!

1654
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,970
你还好吗？嘿，你知道我们赢了吗？
You all right? Hey, you know we won?

1655
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:23,320
－唐，你还好吗？－你知道我们赢了，对吧？嗯？
- Don, are you okay? - You know we won, right? Huh?

1656
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:24,960
－嘿　－来吧
- Hey. - Come on. Come on.

1657
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,040
精彩的比赛
Good race.

1658
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,770
奥运纪录是个好的开始
Olympic record's a nice start.

1659
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,330
但这一切只是为了让我们进入真正重要的比赛
But all that does is get us into the race that matters.

1660
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:33,650
没有人会记得你在预赛中创下的记录
Nobody is gonna remember you set a record at a preliminary.

1661
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:35,720
现在...
Now...

1662
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,420
让我们去看看我们要对付的是谁
let's go see what we're up against.

1663
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:43,940
干得好
Good job.

1664
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:45,940
干得好，干得好
Way to go. Way to go.

1665
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:48,420
干得好，孩子们
Good work, boys.

1666
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:20,710
单人赛，双人赛
Singles, doubles,

1667
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,020
四人赛，他们还没有输过一场
fours, they haven't lost a race yet.

1668
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:31,690
快
Fast.

1669
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:41,030
唐，来吧
Don, come on.

1670
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:43,740
嘿，走吧
Hey, come on.

1671
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,580
你没事吧？
You all right?

1672
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,930
教练，教练！
Coach! Coach!

1673
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:56,280
－你还好吗？－没事，我只是累坏了
- You okay? - Mm-hmm. I'm just worn out.

1674
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,610
谢谢你，医生，谢谢你的帮助
Thank you, Doctor. Thanks for your help.

1675
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,930
怎么说？
What's the word?

1676
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,710
某种虫子，他们不确定是什么
Some kind of bug. They're not sure what.

1677
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:13,730
现在，他脱水严重
Right now, he's very dehydrated.

1678
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:15,280
他需要休息
He needs rest.

1679
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:17,520
接下来的24小时，你们都离他远点
And y'all stay away from him for the next 24 hours.

1680
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,180
我们不能再失去任何人了
We can't afford losing anybody else.

1681
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,370
你说“失去”是什么意思？
What do you mean, "losing"?

1682
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:23,940
如果两天后他还是这样，他就不能参加比赛了
If he's still like this in two days, he's not racing.

1683
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:31,190
决赛航道分配
Lane assignments for the finals.

1684
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:41,800
你不能在比赛中间
You can't change the rules

1685
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:43,370
改变规则
in the middle of a competition!

1686
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:46,170
最快的预赛选手优先选择航道
The fastest qualifiers earn the favored lanes.

1687
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:47,730
一直就是这样
That is the way it's always been.

1688
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,390
我们创造了最好的记录
And we posted the best time,

1689
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:51,040
你却把我们困在外面
and you've gone and stuck us on the outside.

1690
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,540
这是奥委会决定的航道分配公式
This was the lane formula the committee decided on.

1691
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,910
什么时候？就在你们队
When? Right after your squad

1692
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,430
划出最慢的排位时间之后？
posted the slowest qualifying time?

1693
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:57,290
小心你的指控，乌尔布里克森教练
Be careful of your accusations, Coach Ulbrickson.

1694
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:59,550
你见过航道上的风，你知道
You've seen the winds on that course and you know

1695
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:01,470
顶风时，有两个长度的劣势
there's a two-length disadvantage when it blows.

1696
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:02,800
我相信你的艇员们会处理好的
I'm sure your crew will manage.

1697
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,830
天气预报预计今天会风平浪静
The forecasters expect a calm day.

1698
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,360
嗯...
Well...

1699
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:11,720
我们对此表示抗议
We'll protest this.

1700
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:13,540
记下了，祝你好运
Noted. And good luck.

1701
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:15,860
好了，听好了，孩子们
All right. Listen up, boys.

1702
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:19,400
这条航道很难走，所以你们开始时得快点
It's a tough lane, so you gotta start quick.

1703
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:21,690
必须让他们在你的视线范围内
You gotta keep them in sight.

1704
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,840
最后500米那里，风会被挡住
That wind will be blocked for the last 500 meters.

1705
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,120
这就是你们的机会
And that's your shot.

1706
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,530
这就是你们拿下他们的地方
That's where you're gonna take 'em,

1707
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:29,580
但前提是，你们得让他们保持在视线范围内
but only if you keep 'em in sight.

1708
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,550
听着，每一支球队
Listen, every one of those teams

1709
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:34,040
为了这一刻，他们训练了一辈子
have trained their whole lives for this moment.

1710
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:36,230
它们都是富家子
They're all legacies.

1711
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,620
我们不是
We're not.

1712
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,490
为了祖国
Row for your country.

1713
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:46,520
为了彼此
Row for each other.

1714
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:49,680
为了一切不利因素
Row for that one moment when everything

1715
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:52,290
都退避三舍的那一刻
that's stacked against you can take a back seat.

1716
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,870
无论结果如何，我都为你们感到骄傲
For what it's worth, I'm proud of you boys.

1717
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,390
好了，出发吧
All right, push off.

1718
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,120
什么？
What?

1719
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:18,580
没事
Nothin'

1720
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:33,640
他们还不如把我们扔
They might as well have stuck us

1721
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:35,230
在北大西洋上
out on the North Atlantic.

1722
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,750
成千上万的人正在入座
Thousands of people are taking their seats, 

1723
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:48,650
男子组八人决赛
gathered for the Men's Eights finals.

1724
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:50,590
世界上最好的六支赛艇队
The world's six best rowing teams

1725
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:52,390
为金牌进行最后的角逐
in one last race for the gold.

1726
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:54,260
德国，意大利，匈牙利
Germany, Italy, Hungary

1727
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,790
德国在单人，双人和四人比赛中摘得金牌
Germany has taken gold in singles, doubles, and fours, 

1728
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:58,460
他们正在追求大满贯
and they're looking for a sweep.

1729
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,270
瑞士，英国和美国
Switzerland, Great Britain, and the United States

1730
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:02,840
位列前六
round out the six.

1731
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:04,700
来自华盛顿的男孩们如此接近于
The boys from Washington so close

1732
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:07,160
将奥运冠军带回西雅图
to bringing an Olympic title back to Seattle.

1733
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:13,370
德国！德国！
Deutschland! Deutschland!

1734
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:18,210
德国！德国！德国！德国！
Deutschland! Deutschland! Deutschland! Deutschland!

1735
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:20,910
德国！德国！德国！德国！
Deutschland! Deutschland! Deutschland! Deutschland!

1736
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:22,890
德国！德国！
Deutschland! Deutschland!

1737
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:26,620
德国！德国！德国！德国！
Deutschland! Deutschland! Deutschland! Deutschland!

1738
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:28,920
德国！德国！
Deutschland! Deutschland!

1739
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,960
唐，你还好吗？
Don, you okay?

1740
01:47:46,450 --> 01:47:48,920
你能行的，唐，好吗？
You got this, Don, all right?

1741
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:56,600
嘿，他说什么？
Hey, what'd he say?

1742
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,650
好吧，来吧，让我们赢下这一场
All right. Come on, let's win this.

1743
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:00,950
桨准备好了
Oars ready.

1744
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:08,090
来吧
Come on.

1745
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,800
好吧，我们有两段风
All right, we got two lengths of wind

1746
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,330
来弥补这差距
to make up on this bunch.

1747
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,300
所以，我们从38拍开始
So, we start at 38.

1748
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:15,840
鲍比，鲍比
Bobby! Bobby!

1749
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:18,100
妈的！划！
Shit! Row! Row!

1750
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:21,670
来吧
Come on.

1751
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:24,980
哦，上帝啊，他听不到
Oh, God! He couldn't hear him.

1752
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:26,470
美国人一出场就跌跌撞撞
The Americans have stumbled out of the gate, 

1753
01:48:26,590 --> 01:48:28,000
已经落到了最后
already a full boat behind.

1754
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:36,550
蹬腿
Legs through.

1755
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:38,610
好的，现在换到30拍
All right, now move to 30.

1756
01:48:38,690 --> 01:48:41,030
走！破，划
Go! In, through.

1757
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:42,660
蹬腿
Legs through!

1758
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,430
破，划，破
In, through! In!

1759
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:58,610
好吧，我们有38拍
All right. We got 38!

1760
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,110
给我40拍
Give me 40!

1761
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:02,150
破，划

1762
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:03,750
破，划
In, through!

1763
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,920
破，划，上
In, through! Go!

1764
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:08,190
快点，唐，加速
Come on, Don, pick it up.

1765
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,290
腿用力，破，划
In the legs! In, through!

1766
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:12,820
破，划

1767
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:15,070
－破，划！－是时候行动了
- In, through! - It's time to move!

1768
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,510
来吧，唐
Come on, Don.

1769
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,130
去，唐
Go, Don!

1770
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:24,870
来吧，孩子们
Come on, boys.

1771
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:44,110
德国仅次于意大利
Germany is just behind Italy, 

1772
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,590
英国紧随其后
followed by Great Britain.

1773
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,580
美国仍然排在最后，远远落后于匈牙利
The U.S. still in last, well behind Hungary.

1774
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:54,390
给我加速！必须加速
Give me more! Gotta have more!

1775
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,500
来吧，唐，给我40拍

1776
01:49:57,640 --> 01:49:58,870
腿用力
In the legs.

1777
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:00,240
加油，唐，加油，唐
Push it, Don. Come on, Don!

1778
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:01,710
现在是个好时机，休姆
Now would be a good time, Hume!

1779
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,880
来吧，唐！振作起来
Come on, Don! Pick it up!

1780

来吧，唐
Come on, Don.

来吧，唐
Come on, Don.

1783
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:13,090
给我40拍，你可以的
Gotta give me 40. You have it.

1784
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:15,030
把它给我
Give it to me.

1785
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,060
来吧，给我40拍
Come on, give me 40.

唐，来吧
Don! Come on!

1791
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:28,330
每天清晨，每天傍晚
Every morning, every evening

1792
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,070
我们玩得开心吗？
Ain't we got fun?

1793
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:32,750
钱不多，哦，但是亲爱的
Not much money, oh, but honey

1794
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,810
我们不是有...吗？
Ain't we got...

1795
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:36,110
没错，唐给我40拍
That's right, Don! Give me 40!

1796
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:37,810
去吧，划
Go! Through!

1797
01:50:37,950 --> 01:50:39,980
蹬腿
Legs through!

1798
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,210
抬头
Eyes up!

1799
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:43,210
放低！
