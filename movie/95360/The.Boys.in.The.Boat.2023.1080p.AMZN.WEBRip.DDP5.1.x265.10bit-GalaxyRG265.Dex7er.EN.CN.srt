1110
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:52,450
Doesn't matter.
无所谓

1111
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,140
Just sayin' we're not different.
我只是说, 我们并没有什么不同

1112

You and me.

Except you're not a thief.

One! Way-nuff!

Again! Need to get sharper.
再来一次！节奏再快一点

1117
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,130
Come on.
来吧

1118
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,170
You guys are out of sync. Find Hume.
你们不同步 跟着休姆

1119
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,440
Take it off Hume.

1120
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,170
Look like a team, fellas.
像个团队, 伙计们

1121
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:32,530
As one.

You're out of sync.

Okay, no, no. Way-nuff.
好吧 不 停桨

1124
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:39,190
Where are we off? Hey, Joe, you with us?
我们要去哪里？嘿, 乔, 你和我们在一起吗？

1125
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,910
- Me? - Yeah, lock in on Don.
- 我 - 对 锁定唐的节奏

你在说什么？我不是问题所在

1127
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,390

In and through.
破 划

1131

All right, give me three more. Three,

two,
二

1133
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,930
one. Way-nuff!
一 停桨

1134
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,360
That'd get us a solid sixth.
这样我们肯定能拿到第六名

1135
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:01,730
It's new water, they're still getting comfortable.
这是新水域, 他们还没适应

1136
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,460
First times were faster.

1138
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,770
What is the matter?
怎么回事？

1139
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,690
Not in tune yet. I'll get 'em there, Coach.
还没协调好 我会带好他们的 教练

1140
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,690
Let's do it before the race, Bobby.
让我们在赛前先协调好吧 鲍比

1141
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:11,980

Starboard, tap on. Ready?

<i>Probably nervous.</i>

1145
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,400
<i>They're just kids, Al.</i>

<i>I was wrong for bringin' them.</i>

1148
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:30,570
I just can't afford for them to be kids.
我没有本钱再让他们孩子气下去了

1149
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,290
Not anymore.
现在不一样了

1150
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,840
- It looks like they... - I know what's wrong.
- 看起来他们... - 我知道问题在哪了

1151
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,410
Bring it in.
带进来

1152
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,160
You have 500 perfect meters.

1153
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,440
And then another five, where it looks like

1154
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:21,730
you're rowing eight different boats.
你们在划八条不同的艇

1155
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,120
The timing's just a little off.
时间就是有点对不上

1156
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,230
Joe, where is your head at, son?
乔, 你的心思在哪里呢, 孩子？

1157
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,680

- 在艇上 - 不, 不在

1158
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,040
You're setting your own pace.
你在跟着自己的节奏走

1159
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,550
Your catch is higher than the rest.

1160
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:32,150
- I'm trying to... - Don't interrupt me.
- 我想...- 别打断我

1161
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,650
You're rowing like you're in a single.
你就像在单人划艇一样

1162
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,560
We've been doing this too goddamn long to forget

1163
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,490
you're in an eight-man shell.
你是在一个八人艇上

1164

01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,560
You're in Rantz's seat.
你坐在兰茨的位置上

Get out. You don't care? Get out.

01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,620
Coy, come on, let's go.
科伊, 来吧, 我们走

1171
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,950
Looks like you're racin' tomorrow.
看来你明天要参加比赛了

1172
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,350
Now, maybe we can row as a team.
现在, 也许我们可以像一个团队一样划了

1173
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,500
And just go talk to Coach, tell him you want back in.
去和教练谈谈 告诉他你想回去

1174
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,280
I'm not beggin' him to give my place back.
我不会求他把我的位置还给我的

1175
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,850
- I'm done with that. - Where you gonna go?
- 我受够了 - 你要去哪儿？

1176
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,150
Ain't like you got money enough for a train ticket.
你的钱又不够买张火车票

1177
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,510
I'll figure somethin' out. I always have.
我会想办法的 我一向如此

1178
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,340
Are you gonna live in a car in Poughkeepsie?
你要在波基普西找个车住进去吗？

1179
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,200
Hello, Roger. Hello, Joe.
你好 罗杰 你好 乔

1180
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,780
I need to put another coat on the <i>Husky Clipper.</i>
我需要在 "赫斯基快艇" 上再涂一层漆

1181
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,560
I could use a hand.
需要人帮忙

1182
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,760
My grandfather would let me help oil the shells he built.
我爷爷会让我帮他造的船上油

1183
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:06,590
Most hate it because of the smell.
大多数人讨厌它是因为有味道

1184
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,820
I catch the scent of whale oil and immediately hear his voice
我一闻到鲸油的味道, 立刻就听到了他的声音

1185
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,330
telling me to, "Keep putting it on"
告诉我 "继续涂"

1186
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,760
"until you can see your freckles in the reflection."
"直到你能从反光中看到你脸上的雀斑"

1187
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:18,070
That's how I'd know it was good and slick.
这样我才知道它又好又滑

1188
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,630
So it would cut through the water like a knife blade.
这样, 它就能像刀刃一样划过水面

1189
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,870
How it didn't matter how fast someone rowed
划得再快也没用

1190
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,260
if the water didn't flow across the hull
如果水不是以完全正确的方式

1191
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,100
in the exact right way.
流过船体

1192
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,320
If the weight wasn't balanced just right.
如果重量没有恰到好处地平衡

1193
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:38,300
Every piece working with the other.
每一部分都要相互配合

1194
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,390
It's the same with the crew.
艇员也是一样

1195
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,520
So much that there's really no difference between the two.
以至于两者之间真的没有什么区别

1196
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:54,080
They're connected by all the hours spent together.
他们因一起度过的所有时光而团结在一起

1197
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,510
Sweat and pain
汗水和痛苦

1198
01:16:57,050 --> 01:17:00,320
bleeds into the grain as they become one magical thing
洇湿了艇身的纹理, 它们变成了在水面上穿梭的

1199
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,540
that moves across the water
一个神奇的东西

1200
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,840
like it was born to be nowhere else.
就像天生就不属于任何地方一样

1201
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,370
I've built a lot of good boats, but the best ones,
我造过很多好船，但最好的艇

1202
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:14,610
the boats where every part fits exactly as it should,
每一个部件都完全吻合的艇

1203
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,340
where every man trusts the one behind him,
每一个人都信任他身后的人的艇

1204
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,840
they are the boats people remember forever.
才是人们永远铭记的艇

1205
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,400
That's what this boat could be.
这就是这艘艇可能成为的样子

1206
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,280
Be a shame for anyone to miss
看看这艘所有部件都完美配合的艇能跑多快

1207
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,930
seeing how fast it could go with all the right pieces.
如果有人错过了 那就太可惜了

1208
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:39,060
Joe, your dad gave up on you. He quit on you.
乔 你爸爸放弃了你 他放弃了你

1209
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,120
All you know is quitting.
你就只会放弃

1210
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,860
But it seems to me you're not him.
但在我看来, 你不是他

1211
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:54,120
Or are you?
或者你是？

1212
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,250
- Yes. - Yes, it's very nice.

1213
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,830
If I can get you two to just stand together.
如果你们两个能站在一起的话

1214
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,510
Just for one. And perfect.
再来一张 完美

1215
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,490
I'll, uh, see you over there.
我们那边见

1216
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:14,290
What can I do for you, Joe?
我能为你做什么, 乔？

1217
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,220
I want my seat back.
我想要回我的位置

1218
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,470
Why?

1219
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:24,410
All that time I spent in it,

1220
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:26,610
the work we all did together...

1221
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,450

1222
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,060
it's all I got.
是我的全部

1224
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,450
It's all I got.
我只有这些了

1225
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,960
I can't lose that.
我不能失去

1226
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,880
You know, one of the first things I said to you boys was
我对你们说的第一件事就是

1227
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,180
there's no shame if your body can't hold up to this.
如果你的身体承受不了, 这并不丢人

1228
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,520
The same goes for the mind.
精神也是一样

1229
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,440
Listen, I know it isn't easy to trust every other person
听着, 我知道要信任那条艇上的每一个人

1230
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,420
on that boat as much as you trust yourself.
就像信任自己一样 并不容易

1231
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,760
But it's not about you.

1232
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,770
As good as you are, it's not about you, Joe,
虽然你很优秀 但这不是你一个人的事情 乔

1233
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,570
or me, or anybody else.
