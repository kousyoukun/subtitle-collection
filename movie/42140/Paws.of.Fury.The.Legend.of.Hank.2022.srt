00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:46,000


3
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
这是从哪里来的?
Where did that come from?

4
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,720
标题部门!
The title department!

5
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
是的!
Yah!

6
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,840
那个蓝色应该更蓝 蓝色 
That blue should be more blue, blue.

7
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,440
嗯? 噢!

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
这是错误 啊!
That's wrong. Ahh!

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,520
你不能爬那些 重新开始 
You can't climb those. Start again.

10
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,880
你喜欢这些吗?
Do you like these?

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
不! 啊!
No! Ahh!

12
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,560
一切都好吗?
How's everything coming along?

13
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,200
将军将在一周后来访 
The Shogun is coming to visit in one week.

14
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,920
大家都知道他在做决定
Everyone knows he's trying to decide

15
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,320
谁将是他的继任者 
who his successor will be.

16
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,720
如果这事跟我有关 那一定是我 
And if I have anything to do with it, it'll be me.

17
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,720
我不惜重金让这里成为全国最宏伟的宫殿 
I've spared no expense making this the grandest palace in the land.

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,680
进口老鼠去追逐 
Imported mice to chase,

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
好漂亮的沙发 
fine couches to ruin.

20
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,920
我甚至得到了世界上第一和第二大的纱线团 
I even got first and second largest balls of yarn in the world.

21
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,520
天啊 你胆子真大 
My, you have big balls.

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
皇宫中皇冠上的宝石 
And the crown jewel of the palace,

23
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,200
我家的浴室 
my state-of-the-art bathroom.

24
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,960
看哪 未来!
Behold, the future!

25
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
我称之为超级马桶
I call it the Super Bowl.

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
因为这就是超级马桶
Because that's what it is, a super bowl!

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
让人印象深刻 
Impressive.

28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,320
我希望将军会这么想 
I hope the Shogun thinks so.

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,720
现在唯一要解决的就是我们的小问题了 
The only thing left to solve is our little problem.

30
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,560
— Kakamucho ? — 精确 
- Kakamucho? - Precisely.

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
如果你是房东 你会怎么做
What do you do when you're a landlord

32
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,280
你有讨厌的房客吗?
and you have tenants you really hate?

33
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
你驱逐他们 
You evict them.

34
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,400
但这个小镇已经存在了几千年了 
But the town's been there for thousands of years.

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,400
我给你命令 你就告诉我事实?真的吗?
I give you an order and you give me facts? Really?

36
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,000
我唯一感兴趣的是那个毛球镇
The only fact I'm interested in is that that hairball of a town

37
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,920
破坏了我美丽的风景 
is ruining my magnificent view.

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,640
我们得把他们按顺序从地图上抹去
We've got to wipe them off the map in order

39
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,560
让这座宫殿变得完美 
to make this palace absolutely perfect.

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,040
但是保护他们的武士呢?
But what about the Samurai that's there to protect them?

41
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,040
除掉他们的武士!
Just get rid of their samurai!

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,880
胆小的猫会跟着来 
The fraidy cats will follow.

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,960
但要确保它不会追查到我身上 
But make sure it can't be traced back to me.

44
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,200
土匪!
Bandits!

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,360
你警告其他人 我去找武士 
You warn the others, I'll get the samurai.

46

陌生人危险!陌生人危险!
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

50

武士先生 武士先生!

啊!哦 不!啊!

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
我知道这些事情看起来很可怕
I know these events look dire,

58
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,920
但我们必须自力更生 战斗到底 
but we must stand on our own four legs and fight.

59
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,880
这是我们的家 
This is our home.

60
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,160
那是我们小猫出生的圣地 
It is the sacred place where our kittens were born

61
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,920
总有一天我们会在那里与祖先相聚

62
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,040
埋在车库后面的鞋盒里 
In a shoebox buried behind the garage.

63
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,160
卡茨医生 你有什么要说的吗?

64
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,160
不 我只是有个毛球

65
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,360
我们需要的是一个武士

66
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,960
我们还是找不到最后一个 
We still can't find the last one.

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,960
我们甚至贴了海报

68
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,920
我们需要一个新的武士!
What we need is a new samurai!

71

我们的老武士哪来的?
Where did we get our old samurai?

72
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Samurais-R-Us吗?
Samurais-R-Us?

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,600
不!从幕府将军!
No! From the Shogun!

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,840
所以 我们为什么不让幕府将军给我们寄一个新的呢?
So, why don't we ask the Shogun to send us a new one?

75
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,960
好的 我知道了 
OK, I've got it.

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,520
我们为什么不让将军给我们寄一个新的呢?是吗?
Why don't we ask the Shogun to send us a new one? Eh?

77
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,920
工作,工作,工作 让我们看看…今天的议程是什么?

What's this? Our sacred soil has been soiled by a dog

81
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,920
谁越境了?
who crossed the border?

82
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,400
可能是边境牧羊犬 
Probably a border collie.

83
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,160
幸运的是他被逮捕了 
Fortunately he's been apprehended.

84
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
好吧 你犯法了 就要付出代价 
Oh well, you break the law, you pay the price.

85
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,400
这不是私人恩怨 这只是生意 
It's not personal, it's just business.

86
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
你知道他们怎么说吗 
And you know what they say,

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,640
没有什么生意比得上幕府将军的生意 
there's no business like Shogun business.

88
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,720

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,320
等等 狗是可爱的 你怎么能讨厌一只狗呢?
Wait, but dogs are lovable. How could you hate a dog?

140
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
我爸爸讨厌狗 这对我来说就够了 
My dad hated dogs and that's good enough for me.

141
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,320
这并不是基于逻辑 
It's not really based on logic.

142
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,000
恨是对的 你知道吗?
It just feels right to hate, you know?

143
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,160
嘿 对我来说很有道理 
Hey, makes sense to me.

144
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
现在是第一个 
Now severing number one.

145
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
第一 
Number one.

146
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,920
第一 
Number one.

147
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,400
我不想!
I don't wanna!

148
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,680
什么?我不想那样做
What? I don't want to do that,

149
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,920
我不想上去 
I don't want to go up there.

150
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,520
那么,好吧 你不必这么做 真的吗?谢谢你！
OK then. You don't have to. Really? Thank you!

151
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,400
当然!我是说 我们算什么 野蛮人吗?
Of course! I mean, what are we, barbarians?

152
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,160
弓箭手!
Archers!

153
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,320
我正在思考呢!
I'm trying to think up here!

154
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,120
我知道你有很多犯人要杀 
I know you've got a lot of prisoners to kill,

155
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
拜托 你能小声点吗?
but please, can you keep it down?

156
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
对不起!是的,谢谢你!
Sorry! Yeah, thank you!

157
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,960
嗯?
Huh?

158
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,960
他去!
There he goes!

159
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,880
是的!
Yah!

160
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,440
我们就不能好好谈谈吗?
Hey, can't we just talk this out?

161
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,600
我不会说狗话!
I don't speak dog!

162
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,120
但是等等 我们现在正在沟通 
But wait, we're communicating right now.

163
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,040
不,我们没有!你明白我的意思 
No, we're not! You just understood me.

164
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,520
不,我没有 
No, I didn't.

165
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
你就不该来这里 狗!你不属于这里!
You should never have come here, dog! You don't belong!

166
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
他在那儿!
There he is!

167
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
唷!
Phew!

168
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,440
Dog-gone它!
Dog-gone it!

169
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,520
计划……计划……
Plan... plan...

170
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,080
我所需要的东西……是的!
What I need... Yes!

171
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,960
我会派出世界上最糟糕的武士 
I'll send the worst samurai in the entire world,

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
他会做得很糟糕 
and he'll do a terrible job.

173
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,040
但你要去哪里找真正不好的东西呢?
But where do you look for something truly bad?

174
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,520
等等!拜托!
Wait! Please!

175
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
我来你们国家只是为了学武士!
I only came to your country to learn to be a samurai!

176
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,600
好像狗也能成为武士似的 击球 从来没有!
As if a dog could ever become a Samurai. Pft. Never!

177
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,760
一只狗 一只狗!哈!
A dog. A dog! Huh!

178
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,080
把你的火!
Hold your fire!

179
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
噢…
Aww...

180
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
好保存 
Nice save.

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,280
总是很乐意帮忙 
Always happy to lend a hand.

182
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,520
你好,在那里!谁是条好狗?
Hi, there! Who's a good dog?

183
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,160
是啊 谁是条好狗 谁是条好狗?
Yeah, who's a good dog, who's a good dog?

184
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,920
这是不是说你不打算杀我了?
Does this mean you're not going to kill me?

185
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
恰恰相反!
On the contrary!

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,240
我们来谈谈你能为我做什么 
Let's talk about what you can do for me.

187
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,880
我提议让你成为卡卡穆乔的新武士 
I am offering to make you the new samurai of Kakamucho.

188
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,280
Kakamucho吗?那是什么?在路上 
Kakamucho? What's that? In the way.

189
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,720
但那没有你重要
But that's not as important as you are

190
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,200
在这个幸运、幸运的时刻 
at this lucky, lucky moment.

191
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,120
你确定我准备好保卫整个小镇了吗?
Are you sure I'm ready to defend an entire town?

192
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,640
也许我应该从商场武士开始…
Maybe I should start out as a mall samurai or...

193
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
什么? !
What?!

194
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,280
不,不!
No, no!

195
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,160
是时候把我的新武士带到卡卡穆乔了
Time to get my new samurai to Kakamucho

196
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,400
这样他就能快点死…
so he can hurry up and die-eeve...

197
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
潜水……正确的!
Dive... right in!

198
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,440
哇,嗯…
Whoa, uh...

199
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,240
所以我得到一个 徽章或证书
So do I get a... badge or a certificate

200
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,240
或者是正式的?
or you know, something official-like?

201
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,720
嗯?
Huh?

202
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,240
好了 一切都正式了 
There you go, makes it all official.

203
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
哇!一个武士杯 
Wow! A samurai cup.

204
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,920
是的 他们都有一个 给大家看看 
Yes, they've all got one. Just show that around.

205
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,520
“哇 他有一个杯子!”他是一个武士!
"Wow, he's got a cup! He's a samurai!

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,120
我们最好照他说的做 ”
We better do what he says."

207
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,720
好了 我们该走了 
Well, better get going.

208
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,040
那个小镇本身不会武士的 
That town isn't gonna samurai itself.

209
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,680
但我不知道我要去哪里!
But I don't know where I'm going!

210
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,560
别担心 马知道 
Don't worry, the horse knows.

211
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
他有GPS !
He's got GPS!

212
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,960
头晕了…定位系统!
Giddy up... Positioning System!

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,720
你为什么派狗去保护卡卡穆乔?
Why are you sending the dog to defend Kakamucho?

214
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,040
他们会杀了他 
They will kill him.

215
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,760
孤儿院说你永远不会开口 
And the orphanage said you would never speak.

216
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,760
是的 他们会杀了他 
Yes, they will kill him.

217
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
杀死一个正式的武士…
And killing an official samurai...

218
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,520
哎呀 这是违法的!
Why, that's against the law!

219
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,936
我就得把他们都抓起来 
I would have to arrest all of them.

220
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,960
这样镇上就没人住在我想要的地方了…
And that would leave no one in the town where I want...

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,400
没有一个人 
no one.

222
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,840
你知道我们要去哪 
You did know where we were going.

223
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,720
这是最新的东西 这叫枪 
It's the latest thing. It's called a gun.

224
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,920
这是危险的吗?别傻了 
Is it dangerous? Don't be silly.

225
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,720
枪杀不了猫 汽车和好奇心害死猫 
Guns don't kill cats. Cars and curiosity kill cats.

226
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,800
一辆车是什么?小心 你太好奇了 
What's a car? Careful, you're being curious.

227
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,160
他来了 他来了!
He's coming, he's coming!

228
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,800
丫!
Ya!

229
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,680
他在那儿!新的武士!
There he is! The new samurai!

230
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,280
新的武士是一个…
The new samurai is a d...

231
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,400
他是一个什么?
He's a what?

232
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,960
新的武士是一个…
The new samurai is a d...

233
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,520
新武士是侗族?
The new samurai is a dong?

234
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
“欢迎来到Kakamucho ”
"Welcome to Kakamucho."

235
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,040
唷!好的 这里什么都没有 
Whew! OK, here goes nothing.

236
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,640
欢迎委员会?也许事情不会那么糟 
Welcoming committee? Maybe this won't be so bad.

237
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,560
好吧 第一天上班 眼神交流 微笑……
OK, first day on the job. Make eye contact, smile...

238
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,040
它是一只狗!他会毁了一切的!
It's a dog! He's going to ruin everything!

239
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,360
在新武士到来之前杀了他!
Let's kill him before the new samurai arrives!

240
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,600
Sic他!
Sic him!

241
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,560
哇!力量!
Whoa! Oof!

242
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
得到他!撕裂他!
Get him! Tear him up!

243
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
坐!
Sit!

244
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,200
这就是我说的"工作"狗!
Now that's what I call "woking" the dog!

245
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,240
是啊 因为她用锅砸那条狗!
Yeah, 'cause she hit that dog with a wok!

246
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,160
呃 他死了吗?
Uh, is he dead?

247
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
嘿 嘿 看看他口袋里有没有零食 
Hey, hey, see if he has any snacks in his pockets.

248
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,520
哦 这是个骗局!
Oh, it's a trick!

249
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,240
他装死!坏狗!见鬼了!
He's playing dead! Bad doggy! Dang it!

250
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,600
Sic他!等待,等待 
Sic him! Wait, wait.

251
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,480
我们能谈谈吗?闭嘴,狗!
Can we just talk for one minute? Shut up, dog!

252
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,960
我是新的武士!我是!看 这是我的杯子!
I am the new samurai! I am! Look, here's my cup!

253
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
让他尝尝吧!
Let him have it!

254
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
停!
Stop!

255
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,960
他是新的武士!
He is the new samurai!

256
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,680
上面说他是幕府将军亲自任命的!
It says he's been appointed by the Shogun himself!

257
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,600
那是……哇 
Well that is... Wow.

258
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,920
我没想到会这样 
I did not see that coming.

259
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,160
给我!你一定是糊涂了 小姑娘 
Give me that! You must be confused, little girl.

260
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,520
啊!这确实令人失望 
Ugh! Well, this is certainly disappointing.

261
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,640
是什么?
What is?

262
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,400
我不能阅读 
I can't read.

263
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
她是对的 这是官方的 
She's right. It's official.

264
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,360
所以我们不能杀了他?
So, we cannot kill him?

265
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
——是的,没有 ——噢!
- Yeah, no. - Aww!

266
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,920
我知道 我知道 我们都很失望 
Yeah, I know, I know, we're all disappointed.

267
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,520
但我们还是可以恨他的 对吧?
But we can still hate him, right?

268
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,240
——当然 ——耶!
- Absolutely. - Yay!

269
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,920
第一 你不是猫 
You are, number one, not a cat.

270
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
第二 你是条狗 所以这要追溯到
Number two, you are a dog, so that goes back

271
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,080
敬你不是一只猫 C 你肯定是
to you not being a cat. And C, you are definitely

272
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,400
不是武士 因为你是条狗 
not a samurai, because you are a dog,

273
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,200
这又回到了你不是猫的问题上!
and that goes back to you not being a cat!

274
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,920
滚回你的老家去 追车的!
Go back where you came from, car chaser!

275
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,760
再一次!一辆车是什么?
Again! What's a car?

276
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,200
别好奇!你会害死我们的!
Stop being curious! You'll kill us all!

277
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,560
你好吗?
Hi?

278
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,680
嗨 
Hi.

279
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,080
你真的是一只狗吗?
Are you really a dog?

280
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,560
是的 我是一只狗 
Yes. I am a dog.

281
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,840
告诉你了 嗯嗯!
Told you. Hmm mm!

282
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,600
我不知道狗也能当武士 
I didn't know dogs could be samurai.

283
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,160
他们可以 而且我…
Well, they can, and I...

284
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,320
等一下,为什么不呢?
Wait, why not?

285
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,080
你的剑戴反了 不 实际上不是 
Your sword's on backwards. No it's not, actually.

286
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,480
是吗?
Is it?

287
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,040
你知道接下来该怎么做吗?
Do you know how this is supposed to go?

288
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,040
我知道一些关于武士的事 
I know a few things about samuraiing.

289
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
很好 我代理你怎么样
Fair enough. How about I deputise you

290
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,640
做我的官方助理?
as my official assistant?

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
坏狗!别跟他说话!
Bad dog! Don't talk to him!

292
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
你碰他了吗?
Did you touch him?

293
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
是时候使用洗手液了 
Time to use our hand sanitizers.

294
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080
不!不!不!狗有数!
No! No! No! Dog gammit!

295
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,080
我们生活在一个什么样的世界 有善良正直的公民
What kind of a world do we live in where good and upright citizens

296
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,000
不能因为一个人长得不一样就指望他去杀他吗!
can't be counted on to kill someone just because they look different?!

297
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,360
我们可以再揍他们一顿 
We could try beating them up again.

298
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,600
唯一的问题是他们还有一个武士 
Only problem is they still have a samurai.

299
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,280
你在开玩笑吧?他是一个Labradork 
You're kidding me, right? He's a Labradork.

300
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,600
把他的尾巴夹在两腿之间 让我们结束这一切!
Put his tail between his legs and let's finish this!

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
好的 这里什么都没有 
OK, here goes nothing.

302
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
噢!
Ooh!

303
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,080
噢!
Ooh!

304
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,920
噢!
Ow!

305
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,680
哇 
Wow.

306
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
太好了!
Excellent!

307
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,840
没错 我现在是武士了!
That's right, I'm a samurai now!

308
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,080
看箭!看箭!
Take that! Take that!

309
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,560
哦,耶!
Oh, yeah!

310
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,400
哇!力量!
Whoa! Oof!

311
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,080
来一小口怎么样?
How about a little nip?

312
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,320
有点猫薄荷?
A little catnip?

313
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
嗯 我不认为我…
Um, I don't think I...

314
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,600
好吧 我再来点 
Fine, more for me.

315
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,760
你是谁?
Who are you?

316
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,440
我的朋友叫我金宝 
My friends call me Jimbo.

317
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
既然我没有朋友
And since I have no friends...

318
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,120
我猜……你也可以叫我金宝 
I guess... you can call me Jimbo too.

319
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,600
我想这两种方法都可以 
I guess that works either way.

320
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,920
金宝 我是汉克 
Well, Jimbo, I'm Hank,

321
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,920
我是新的武士
and I'm the new samurai.

322
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,720
新武士,嗯?
New samurai, huh?

323
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,280
你知道你的剑戴反了吗?
You know your sword's on backwards?

324
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,000
我猜你知道一切是因为你是个武士?
Oh, and I suppose you know everything because you're a samurai?

325
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,280
我知道你不是 
Well, I know you're not.

326
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,560
为什么?因为我是条狗?
Why? Because I'm a dog?

327
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,520
没有 因为你是个白痴 
No. Because you're an idiot.

328
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,920
真正的武士是不会穿成这样的 
No real samurai would be caught dead wearing that.

329
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,920
那是浴袍吗?你从酒店弄来的?
Is that a bathrobe? You get that from a hotel?

330
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
你不是武士 对吧?
You're not a samurai, are you?

331
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,120
我知道,对吧?我不是!
I know, right? I'm not!

332
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
我来这里是为了学武士的 
I came here to learn to be a samurai,

333
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
然后我得到了这份工作 但我没有
and then I got this job, but I don't have

334
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,880
一点也不知道我在做什么 
the slightest idea what I'm doing.

335
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,240
嘿 有书吗?你知道 一份说明书 
Hey, is there a book? You know, an instruction manual,

336
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,040
比如《如何成为一名武士》
like "How to be a Samurai"?

337
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,600
你是说《傻瓜武士》吗?是的!
You mean "Samurai For Dummies"? Yes!

338
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,880
不!那就太蠢了 
No! That would be dumb.

339
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,640
喔,喔,喔!
Ow, ow, ow!

340
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,080
好的,那伤害!好吧,噢!啊!
OK, that hurts! OK, ow! Ah!

341
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,520
噢!
Ow!

342
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,200
噗!
Pffff!

343
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,920
你最好出去 
You better get out there.

344
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,920
这是武士……
It's samurai time...

345
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
.．.你是武士 对吧?
...and you're the samurai, right?

346
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,560
嗯…外面看起来有点危险 
Uh... it looks a little dangerous out there.

347
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,440
哦,是的 危险的 这就是NWA 
Oh, yeah. Dangerous. That's NWA out there.

348
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,400
忍者与态度 
Ninjas With Attitude.

349
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,040
但是你继续 这将是伟大的 
But you go ahead. It'll be great.

350
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
你是武士!
You are the samurai!

351
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
哦 看那个 是那个刻薄的老太太 
Oh, look at that. It's that mean old lady.

352
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,800
是的,它是 
Yes, it is.

353
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,040
现在 我必须…是的,你做的事情 
Now, I have to... Yes, you do.

354
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,600
也许我可以去跟他们谈谈 是啊!
Maybe I can just go talk to them. Yeah!

355
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,400
你知道 解决这个问题 你应该这样做 
You know, work this out. You should do that.

356
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,040
我要!你去和他们讲道理 
I will! You go reason with them.

357
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,720
嗯…
Uh...

358
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
原谅我吗?
Excuse me?

359
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,760
请原谅我 
Excuse me, please.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,240
打扰一下!
Excuse me!

361
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,560
迷路了,狗 这是猫的事 
Get lost, dog. This is cat business.

362
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,360
别听他的 你们做得很好!
Don't listen to him, you guys are doing a great job!

363
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,160
剑还是站错边了 
Sword's still on the wrong side.

364
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,200
我的眼睛在这里 
My eyes are up here.

365
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,600
哦 正中眼睛!
Oh, right in the eye!

366
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,960
有趣的选择 用你的脸挡住那些拳 
Interesting choice, using your face to block those punches.

367
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,680
我不会这么想的 是啊 你知道什么?
I wouldn't have considered that. Yeah, well what do you know?

368
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,560
够我不被揍的了 
Enough not to get my butt kicked.

369
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,480
我要去练武士 
I gotta get some samurai training.

370
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,640
我不认为训练能帮到你 
Oh, I don't think training can help you.

371
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
它不能伤害!我该怎么办?
It couldn't hurt! What am I supposed to do?

372
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,520
如果我是你 我会考虑回家 
If I were you, I would consider going home.

373
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,000
也许是一只哈巴狗 
Maybe being a lap dog.

374
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,800
我不能离开 相信你可以!
I can't leave. Sure you can!

375
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,960
我没地方可去了!
I've got nowhere else to go!

376
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,920
我倾尽所有来到这里 
It took everything I had to come here.

377
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
然后是"要么被箭射死 要么接受这份工作"
Then it's "Hey, get shot full of arrows or take this job",

378
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,280
所以我来了!我一定要让这个武士计划成功!
so here I am! I've got to make this samurai thing work!

379
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
我不得不这么做 但首先 我需要学习 
I have to. But first, I need to learn.

380
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,040
听起来你需要一位导师 
Sounds like you need a mentor.

381
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,800
狗的呼吸?
Dog breath?

382
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,200
曼妥斯!
Not Mentos!

383
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,560
导师!一个老师!把你置于他的羽翼之下!
Mentor! A teacher! To take you under his wing!

384
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
把他知道的都教给你 诸如此类 
Teach you all he knows, that kind of thing.

385
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,480
这正是我需要的 
That's exactly what I need.

386
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
也许是曾经伟大的武士
Perhaps a once-great samurai

387
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,880
谁曾陷入困境 也许可以利用
who has fallen on hard times and maybe could use

388
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,080
一些帮助自己 但是我到哪里去找呢?
some help himself. But where would I find one?

389
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,640
嘿,是你!
Hey, it's you!

390
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,400
什么?我要离开这儿!这是谁做的?
What? Get outta here! Who even made that?

391
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,040
不要相信你读到的一切 
Don't believe everything you read.

392
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,960
这是电影里的传统场景
This is traditionally the place in a movie

393
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,120
英雄遇到了他的大机会!
where the hero meets his big opportunity!

394
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
你是我的人 来吧,火车我!
You're my guy. C'mon, train me!

395
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
但你是一只狗 这就是困扰你的事吗?
But you're a dog. Is that that what's bothering you?

396
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,880
你有很多事让我心烦 
There's a lot about you that's bothering me.

397
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,760
比如 你是怎么来的 
Like, for instance, how you got here.

398
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,120
这肯定不容易 
It wasn't easy, that's for sure.

399
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,240
我必须穿越不可逾越的海洋 
I had to cross impassable seas,

400
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,480
不能攀登高山,
unclimbable mountains,

401
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
市中心的交通非常糟糕 
and really nasty midtown traffic.

402
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
但你为什么想成为一名武士?
But why do you want to be a samurai?

403
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,680
我一直是个矮子 每个人都欺负我 
I was always the runt. Everybody always picked on me.

404
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,840
我住在城里贫民区的一个贫民区
I lived in a bad neighbourhood in a bad part of town

405
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,680
全是坏狗 
full of bad dogs.

406
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,560
但这一天 发生了一件了不起的事 
But this day, something awesome happened.

407
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,200
他的移动速度快得你都看不见了 
He moved almost faster than your eye could see.

408
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,320
噢!
Oh!

409
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,680
哇!啊!
Whoa! Ahh!

410
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,040
然后他就走了 
And then he was gone.

411
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,680
一个陌生地方的武士花时间帮忙…
A Samurai in a strange land took the time to help...

412
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,640
…我 
...me.

413
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,200
这就是我来这里的原因 
That's why I came here.

414
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,080
学着像他一样 
To learn to be just like him.

415
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,720
我甚至还留着他的剑 
I even kept his sword.

416
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,680
我一直在想它去哪了 谢谢你！
I've been wondering where that went. Thank you!

417
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
等一下 这是你的剑?
Wait a minute. That's your sword?

418
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,120
那就意味着你…
Then that means you're...

419
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,640
我不想谈这个 
I don't want to talk about it.

420
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,920
但是…你会训练我吗?
But... will you train me?

421
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,960
没有 为什么?因为你太忙了?
Nope. Why? Because you're so busy?

422
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,040
没有 因为你太没脑子了 
No. Because you're so brainless.

423
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,920
啊!但我给你看了我的电影!
Argh! But I showed you my movie!

424
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
整个倒叙!我真不敢相信!
The whole flashback thing! I don't believe it!

425
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,600
我要走了 
Ugh, I'm outta here.

426
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,440
我再也不想见到你了 
And I never want to see you again.

427
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,480
啊!
Ugh!

428
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,080
你!你听到了多少?
You! How much did you hear?

429
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
汉克武士需要你的帮助 
Samurai Hank needs your help.

430
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,600
你不受武士誓言的约束去帮助他吗?
Are you not bound by your Samurai Oath to help him?

431
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,320
你是说我不能对需要帮助的人置之不理吗?
You mean the one that says I can't turn my back on those in need?

432
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,120
是的,这一个 
Yeah, that one.

433
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,360
没有 
No.

434
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
也许吧 
Maybe.

435
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,520
这不是什么…
That's not what...

436
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,280
愚蠢的誓言!
Stupid oath!

437
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,800
它的可爱感很强 
The cuteness is strong with this one.

438
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
这是什么?
What's this?

439
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,640
这是学生(你)和老师(我)之间的契约 
It is a contract between a student, you, and a teacher, me.

440
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,360
我们为什么要签合同?
Uh, why do we need a contract?

441
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,280
因为此时此刻 一切都会很美好
Because at this moment, it would be so nice

442
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,720
如果我不在这里 
if I weren't here.

443
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
如果你毁约 我就不会 
And if you break this contract, I won't be.

444
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,200
此外 这是非常直接的 
Besides, it's very straightforward.

445
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,920
你发誓要勇敢 高尚 
You swear to be brave, honourable,

446
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,600
保护有需要的人 不求荣耀 
protect those in need, not seek glory,

447
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,240
有始有终 永远服从你的主人 
finish what you started, and always obey your master.

448
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,800
武士宣誓!是的 
The Samurai Oath! Yes.

449
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,000
如果你违反了 我们的合同就失效了 你可以回家了 
And if you break it, our contract is broken and you go home.

450
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,960
好吧 我应该让我的律师看看这个吗……
OK, should I have my attorney look at this...

451
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,320
我们没那么多时间 现在在这里签名 
We don't have that kind of time. Now sign here.

452
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
保护你自己!什么……
Defend yourself! What...

453
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,880
我拿着棍子能做什么?
What am I supposed to do with a stick?

454
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,840
第一课:你做什么并不重要 
Lesson one: It is not so important what you do,

455
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,240
因为你做某事是很重要的 
as it is important that you do something.

456
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,400
战士有像猫一样的反应能力 我不是猫 我是狗!
A warrior has cat-like reflexes. I'm not a cat, I'm a dog!

457
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,160
没有人是完美的 
Nobody's perfect.

458
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,040
哎哟!
Ouch!

459
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,480
啊!
Ahh!

460
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
等等!这音乐!
Wait! That music!

461
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,840
这是训练时的蒙太奇 对吧?
Hey, this is the training montage, isn't it?

462
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,096
我们就不能直接跳到我擅长的部分吗?
Hey, can't we just skip ahead to the part where I'm good?

463
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,040
不!这是我最喜欢的部分 
No! This is my favourite part.

464
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,760
你受苦的部分 
The part where you suffer.

465
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,880
过河 尽你所能 
Cross the river. Any way you can.

466
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,600
对猫来说 没有什么是不可攀登的 
To a cat, nothing is unclimbable.

467
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,480
我说过我不是猫吗?
Did I mention I wasn't a cat?

468
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,440
只要走到墙的另一边 
Just make it to the other side of the wall,

469
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,640
然后你就准备好了 
then you will be ready.

470
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800
能帮我一下吗?
Wanna gimme a hand?

471
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,440
非常有趣的…啊!
Very funny... ahh!

472
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,920
别忘了降落在你的…
Don't forget to land on your...

473
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,080
…的脚 
...feet.

474
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,800
哇!
Whoa!

475
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,400
不 
Nope.

476
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
不 
Nope.

477
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,520
哈!
Ha!

478
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,240
嗷 嗷 嗷 嗷!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

479
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,800
哈哈…不!
Haha... Nope!

480
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,520
嗯?
Huh?

481
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,520
哈!
Ha!

482
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,720
我开始觉得你不知道自己在做什么 
I'm starting to think you don't know what you're doing.

483
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,600
我很清楚我在做什么 
I know exactly what I'm doing.

484
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
我说的是培训 
I'm talking about training.

485
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,560
你说你能让我成为武士的 
You said you could make me a samurai.

486
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
我可以给你做个披萨 
I can 'make' you a pizza.

487
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,680
但是我不能把你变成任何东西 
But I cannot make YOU into anything.

488
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,920
这种力量只存在于你自己身上 
That power is only within yourself.

489
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
你说过你会帮我的 不只是用东西打我!
You said you would help me. Not just whack me with stuff!

490
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,720
我的一生都在被摧残 这就是我来这里的原因!
I've been whacked my whole life. That's why I came here!

491
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,440
去学习成为一名武士!
To learn to be a samurai!

492
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,480
嗯…你想要的荣耀 
Mmm... You want glory.

493
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,400
你根本不知道怎么做一个真正的武士 
You know nothing of being a true samurai.

494
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,040
我开始觉得你也不知道!
I'm starting to think you don't either!

495
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,840
你知道吗?我甚至不相信你是一个真正的武士!哈!
And you know what? I don't even believe you are a real samurai! Ha!

496
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
你怎么了?
So, what happened to you?

497
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,920
你是怎么从一个武士变成一个失败者的
How did you go from being a samurai to a washed up loser

498
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,720
猫薄荷喝多了
who drinks too much catnip,

499
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
有明显的体重问题
has an obvious weight problem,

500
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,200
没有真正的朋友 是糖尿病前期…
no real friends to speak of, is pre-diabetic...

501
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,680
够了!
That's enough!

502
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,440
我曾经是首席保镖
There was a time I was chief bodyguard

503
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,320
一位非常重要的官员名叫敏郎·泰富恩
of a very important official named Toshiro Tyfune.

504
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,440
他是一个很酷的人 前途一片光明 
He was a real cool cat, with greatness ahead of him.

505
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,120
这是回忆吗?不要打扰我 
Is this a flashback? Don't interrupt me.

506
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,720
如果是倒叙 试试放映机 
If it's a flashback try the projector,

507
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,280
它真的让事情变得生动起来 我不需要投影仪 
it really brings the thing to life. I don't need the projector.

508
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,280
这是老套的回忆 现在别打断我了!
It's an old-fashioned remembering, now stop interrupting!

509
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,920
一天深夜 我们被叫去开会 
We had been summoned to a meeting late one night.

510
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,560
这一切都很神秘 
It was all very mysterious.

511
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,400
就是感觉不对 
Just didn't feel right.

512
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,680
这是埋伏 趴下!
It's an ambush, get down!

513
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,480
啊!
Ahh!

514
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,760
生日快乐吗?
Happy birthday?

515
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,760
我不仅毁了他人生中最重要的一晚 
I not only ruined the biggest night of his life,

516
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
我为他的姻亲做了绝育手术 
I spayed and neutered his in-laws.

517
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,880
我打破了武士誓言 
I broke my Samurai Oath.

518
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,720
我是羞辱 
I was shamed.

519
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,760
所以我才离开 
That's why I left.

520
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,320
我跟你做个交易 我们会互相帮助 
I'll make you a deal. We'll help each other.

521
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,880
不是有益的 
Not helpful.

522
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
今天 我们开始做一些新的事情 
Today, we begin something new.

523
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,560
我明白了我不能把狗教成猫 
I have learned I cannot teach a dog to be a cat.

524
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,240
我必须做的是教狗成为一只更好的狗 
What I must do is teach a dog to be a better dog.

525
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
那是什么?
What's that?

526
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,640
眼罩是为了帮助你集中注意力 
The blindfold is to help you focus.

527
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,360
啊 现在,倾听 
Ah. Now, listen.

528
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,320
告诉我你听到了什么 我听到你在说……
Tell me what you hear. I hear you talking...

529
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
和移动 好 
and moving. Good.

530
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,440
我听到一只鸟的声音 
I hear a bird.

531
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
就是这样 事实上 我闻到了花香 
That's it. I smell flowers, actually.

532
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,040
狗有敏锐的嗅觉和极好的听觉 
Dogs have a keen sense of smell and excellent hearing.

533
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
我听到一只蜻蜓的声音 
I hear a dragonfly.

534
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,400
我闻到木头燃烧的味道 
I smell wood burning.

535
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,520
我闻到了泡茶的味道 
I smell tea brewing.

536
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,120
嘿 你在做玉米片吗?
Hey, are you making nachos?

537
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,240
因为有人刚刚切了奶酪 
'Cause someone just cut the cheese.

538
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,280
课结束了 做得很好 
Lesson over. Well done.

539
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
在战斗中 就像在生活中一样……
In battle as in life...

540
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,720
武士努力保持平衡 
a samurai strives to maintain his balance.

541
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
哈!噢!
Ha! Oh!

542
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,680
总是用聪明战胜力量 
And always defeats strength with smart.

543
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,520
我懂了!
I can dig it!

544
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,480
你必须控制你的恐惧 否则恐惧会控制你 
You must control your fear, or fear will control you.

545
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,120
这是一种武士控制自己空间和身体的舞蹈 
It is a dance in which a samurai controls his space and his body.

546
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,480
啊!
Ah!

547
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,800
哇!你学到了什么?
Whoa! What are you learning?

548
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,120
我不像以前那么喜欢棍子了?
I don't like sticks as much as I used to?

549
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,840
你在这里学到了什么?
What are you learning in here?

550
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,240
这与狗的体型无关 
It's not the size of the dog in the fight,

551
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,000
这是战斗的规模…
it's the size of the fight in the...

552
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,680
不!这是狗在战斗中的大小!
No! It IS the size of the dog in the fight!

553
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,320
大狗的问题更少 让我展示 
A big dog has fewer problems. Let me demonstrate.

554
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,640
持有 
Hold this.

555
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,400
看到了吗?这不会发生在一只大狗身上!
See? That wouldn't happen to a big dog!

556
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,040
我们仍然落后于计划!
We're still behind schedule!

557
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,720
幕府将军三天内就会到!
The Shogun will be here within three days!

558
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,800
哦

00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
啊!
Ahh!

560
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,640
我周围都是蠢货 彻头彻尾的蠢货 
I'm surrounded by imbeciles, complete morons.

561
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,360
你一定很难过吧 
It must be so hard for you,

562
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,920
你表现出的耐心和善良 
the patience and kindness that you show.

563
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,600
大贺 别误会 好吗?
Ohga, don't take this the wrong way, OK?

564
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,120
但你是个彻底的失败者 让人非常失望 
But you are a total failure and a major disappointment.

565
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,200
没有栅栏 没有一个 
No of fence. None taken.

566
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,280
我们总是欢迎建设性的批评 
Constructive criticism is always welcome...

567
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,560
嘘 我对你期望不高 你还是让我失望 
Shh. I didn't expect much of you, and you still disappointed me.

听着 卡卡穆乔的猫

我们离离开并不比开始的时候更近 
are no closer to leaving than when we started.

570
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,760
如果你不能完成任务 
If you can't get the job done,

571
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,360
也许是时候找个真正的专业人士了 
perhaps it's time for a real professional.

572
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,320
让野兽进来!
Send in the beast!

573
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,320
现在出去 
Now get out.

574
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,800

579
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,160
你破坏了我的成熟 
You're harshing my mellow.

580
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,600
哦,对不起 
Oh, sorry.

581
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,320
教我一些!耐心呢?
Teach me something! How about patience?

582

来吧 教教我吧!
Come on, teach me anything!

583
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,520

Seriously, let's do this! I'm ready for it.

584
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,840
这些怎么样?你还没准备好 
How about these? You're not ready for those.

585
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,360
能有多难?是的!Hwah !

614
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,600
为了你自己的利益 你应该投降…
In your own best interest, you should surrender...

615
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,320

620
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,560

632

633
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,080
专心比赛 汉克!
Head in the game, Hank!

634
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,720
啊!
Ahh!

00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,280

640
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,920
但既然你自己已经这么做了…
but since you're already doing that yourself...

641
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,000
我们带他去看医生吧 
let's get him to a doctor.

哦 是的 是的 是的 绝对的 必须这样做 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Gotta do that.

643

我可能真的伤到他了 我是说 看看他!
I might have really hurt him, I mean, look at him!

644
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,040

这伤害了吗?
Did that hurt?

648
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,240
一点感觉都没有 
Didn't feel a thing.

649
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,720

652
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,840
有时我对自己的力量感到惊讶 
Sometimes I'm surprised by my own strength.

653
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,480
镇上来了个新警长 好吗?
There's a new sheriff in town, alright?

654
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,280
你最好别再让我抓到你违法了 明白吗?
Better not let me catch you breaking the law again, you feel me?

655
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,440
你可以走了 以前没有人能打败相扑 
You're free to go. No one ever beat Sumo before.

656
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,640
以前没有人对我好 
No one ever nice before.

657
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,520
现在对汉克有感觉了 
Now have feelings for Hank.

658
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,360

659
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,600

660
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,800

661
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,240
嘘!这是为你 
Psst! It's for you.

662
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,640
我想谢谢你打败相扑 
I wanted to say thank you for defeating Sumo.

663
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,800
不客气 只有一件事……
And you are welcome. Only one thing...

664
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,160
我们不能在街上说话 或者其他类似的事情 
We can never talk on the street or anything like that.

665
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,440
你知道 这看起来不太对 你是一个…
You know, just wouldn't look right, you being a...

666
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,160
你知道的 是的 我明白了

Here!

668
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,480
谢谢……你 你是查克,对吧?
Thank... you. You're Chuck, right?

669
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,000
嗯,不…
Mmm, no...

670
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,320
查克!我们得走了!
Chuck! We have to go!

671
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,840
我得走了 
I have to go.

672
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,880
武士汉克?
Samurai Hank?

673
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,200
我们想给你点东西 
We wanted to give you something.

674
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,640
我们吗?
We?

675
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,960
所以…你妈妈想给我点甜头?
So... your mom wanted to throw me a bone?

676
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
没有 我妈让我把它交给你 
No. My mom said to hand it to you.

677
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,760
她为什么要这么做?如果我扔出去
Now, why would she do that? Well, if I threw it,

678
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,640
它可能会落到地上又脏又黏 
it might get on the ground all dirty and icky.

679
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,320
不 我的意思是她为什么要给我东西?
No, what I meant is why would she want to give me something?

680
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,040
感谢你拯救了我们的小镇 
To thank you for saving our town.

681
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,040
你是我见过的最棒的狗武士 
You are the best dog samurai I have ever seen.

682
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,960
我是你见过的唯一的狗武士 
I am the only dog samurai you have ever seen.

683
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,880
但我得说 你说得对 
But I gotta say, you're kinda right.

684
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,200
就武士而言 我很厉害 
I am mighty impressive, as far as samurais go.

685
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,160
你们都吃完了吗?因为已经很晚了
Are you all finished? 'Cause it's getting late,

686
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,080
武士也需要睡眠 
and samurai needs his sleep.

687
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,720
看来我的情况真的好转了 是吧?
Really looks like things are turning around for me, eh?

688
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,960
你很幸运 孩子 别让它冲昏了头脑 
You got lucky, kid. Don't let it go to your head.

689
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400

690
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,360
我应该被登记为致命武器 
I should be registered as a lethal weapon.

691
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,920
骄者必败 
Pride goeth before a fall.

692
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,360
你说忍者害怕是什么意思?
What do you mean, your ninjas are afraid?

693
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,800
嗯…自从那条狗打败了相扑
Um... since that dog defeated Sumo,

694
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,160
我的猫都不想…幕府将军会在这里
none of my cats want to... The Shogun will be here

695
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,800
在两天内!我不在乎你的忍者是否害怕 
in two days! I don't care if your ninja are afraid,

696
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,360
把他们带到镇上的路障那里
take them down to that road block of a town

697
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,320
真的 呃!
and really, just, ugh!

698
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,680
你知道我做了什么吗?你的头发和小猫脚?
You know what I've done? Your hair and a catty-pedi?

699
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
是的,但是没有 
Yes, but no.

700
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,320
我比自己还聪明 雇了那条狗 
I've outsmarted my own self by employing that dog.

701
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,320
哦,不错 我好的 
Oh, nice. Me likey.

702
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,320
卡卡穆乔的好公民的问题是…
The problem with the good citizens of Kakamucho is...

703
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,760
卡卡穆乔有太多好公民了 
there are too many good citizens in Kakamucho.

704
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,800
是时候亲自照顾这只杂种狗了
It's time to take care of this mutt myself

705
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,600
用终极武器:我!
with the ultimate weapon: me!

706
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,360
啊 
Ugh.

707
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,720
相扑 就像蝴蝶变成毛毛虫 
Sumo, like butterfly that was once caterpillar,

708
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,200
像dandy-lion飞行 
fly like dandy-lion.

709
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,280
这是一顶帽子 
It's a hat.

710
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,720
这是一艘船!真是太好了!
And this one's a boat! That is really good!

711
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,680
哦 是帽子 你做了什么?
Oops, that was the hat. What did you make?

712
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,240
一只天鹅 
A swan.

713
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,800
还有一些其他的东西 
And some other stuff.

714
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,400
哇哦 太神奇了 
Oh wow, that's amazing.

715
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,560
你可以用折叠的纸做任何东西 
You can make anything out of folded paper.

716
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,440
好吧 给我做个三明治 这不是三明治 但给你…
Alright, make me a sandwich. It's not a sandwich, but here...

717
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,000
我给你做了点东西 
I made you something.

718
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,920
祝你好运 
For good luck.

719
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,000
它看起来像我 
It looks like me.

720
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,120
它会一直提醒你 你是谁 
It will always remind you of who you are.

721
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,600
你是谁?让我们专注于你不是谁!
Who you are? Let's concentrate on who you are not!

722
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,320
那就是武士!
And that would be a samurai!

723
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,800
来吧,吉米 我们正在享受美好的一天 
Come on, Jimbo. We're just enjoying a beautiful day.

724
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,400
阳光灿烂 鸟儿歌唱 
The sun is shining, birds are singing.

725
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,400
而且 照顾相扑的我应该休息一下 
And besides, I deserve a break for taking care of Sumo.

726
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,680
我是说 看看他 
I mean, just look at him.

727
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,760
蝴蝶,哇哇哇!
Butterfly, aww!

728
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,320
这就是重点 
That's just the point,

729
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,640
你有一点点 一点点 一点点的成功…
you have one little itsy-bitsy, tiny weeny bite of success...

730
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,240
不好意思 小什么?小什么,什么?
I'm sorry, tiny what? Tiny what, what?

731
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
什么?什么?
What? What?

732
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,280
什么?
What?

733
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,360
重点是 现在不是庆祝的时候!
The point is, this is no time for celebrating!

734
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,920
是时候加倍努力 更加努力地训练了!
It's time to double your efforts and train even harder!

735
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,320
现在 开始行动吧!
Now, get to it!

736
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,400
汉克!我的战斗英雄!
Hank! My brawling, battling hero!

737
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,200
哦,对不起 我没有打扰你 我是吗?
Oh, sorry. I'm not bothering you. Am I?

738
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,416
不 不 不 我只是 你知道的 去锻炼一下 
No, no, no, I was just, you know, getting a work out in.

739
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,880
当然可以 天哪!非常令人印象深刻的,
Sure. Cor! Very impressive,

740
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,840
你打败了相扑 哦 哇!
you defeating Sumo, oh, wow!

741
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,360
哦 没什么 啊 当然是……
Aw, it was nothing. Ah, sure it was...

742
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,880
什么都没有 总之 我来到了这里
nothing. Anyway, I came here

743
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,800
邀请你来镇上庆祝一下 
to invite you out on the town to celebrate.

744
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,600
今晚 我带你去
Tonight, I'm taking you

745
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,800
去国内最高档的俱乐部 
to the most exclusive club in the country.

746
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,960
即使是会员也不允许进入 
Even the members aren't allowed in.

747
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,320
哇!谢谢你！但我不能去 我…
Wow! Thank you! But I can't go, I...

748
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,600
我答应我的老师我会专心训练 
I promised my teacher I'd stay focused on my training.

749
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
对 听起来你的老师很了不起
Right. Sounds like your teacher is someone

750
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,680
他不快乐 还希望其他人也不快乐 
who's unhappy and wants everyone else to be unhappy too.

751
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,080
你知道吗?你喜欢乐趣吗?你喜欢乐趣 不是吗?
You know? Do you like fun? You like fun, don't you?

752
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
我当然喜欢乐趣!乐趣就是乐趣!
Of course I like fun! Fun is so fun!

753
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,240
乐趣就是乐趣 不是吗?线索就在单词里 
Fun is fun, isn't it? The clue is in the word.

754
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,600
开车!再见!再见!玩得开心 
Drive! Bye! See you later! Have fun.

755
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,840
只是一个晚上而已 没什么大不了的 
It's just one night. It's not a big deal.

756
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,280
这是一件大事 
It is a big deal.

757
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,200
这是唯一的交易 
It's the only deal.

758
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,656
你对我承诺要走到最后
You committed to me to go to the end,

759
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,240
我也为你做了同样的事
and I did the same for you.

760
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,720
你在食言 
You are breaking your word.

761
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,280
我不会食言的 
I am not breaking my word.

762
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,160
我们可以明天再开始训练 
We can start training again tomorrow.

763
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,440
但是今晚 我要和我的老板好好玩玩 
But tonight, I'm going to have some fun with my boss.

764
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,640
我是你的老板 什么?
I am your boss. What?

765
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,320
我是你的老板!
I am your boss!

766
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,720
我的老板?我告诉你该怎么做
My boss? I tell you what to do,

767
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,840
你做到了 
and you do it.

768
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,520
我以为你是我的朋友 
I thought you were my friend.

769
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,640
我是你的老师 你的导师 
I am your teacher. Your mentor.

770
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,560
我们见面的时候我就说了 我不是你的朋友!
As I told you when we met, I am not your friend!

771
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,400
武士只有责任 没有朋友!
A Samurai has only duty, not friends!

772
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,640
不是我的朋友吗?这听起来很悲哀 
Not my friend? Well, that just sounds sad.

773
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,760
比如一个不开心的人 想要其他所有人
Like someone who is unhappy and wants everyone else

774
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,000
也不快乐!
to be unhappy too!

775
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,760
好吧 我不想不快乐!我要去找点乐子 
Well, I don't want to be unhappy! I'm gonna go have some fun.

776
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,960
我希望你成功地玩得开心 
I hope you succeed in having fun,

777
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,720
因为你在其他方面都失败了 
because you have failed in everything else.

778
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,600
你很了解失败 不是吗?
You know a lot about failure, don't you?

779
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,880
我在战斗中打败了无敌的相扑 拯救了小镇!
I defeated the unbeatable Sumo in battle and saved the town!

780
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,720
你连个生日派对都办不好 
You can't even get a birthday party right.

781
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,760
不要等了 
Don't wait up.

782
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,280
弓和哇 这地方太棒了 
Bow and Wow. This place is awesome.

783
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,080
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

784
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,480
嗯…终点?你在开玩笑吧?
Um... end of the line? Are you kidding?

785
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,600
汉克 你还不明白吗?你不用排队 
Hank, don't you get it? There are no lines for you.

786
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,480
你是汉克武士 卡卡穆乔的英雄!
You are Samurai Hank, the hero of Kakamucho!

787
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,120
哦,我的上帝!这就是武士汉克!卡卡穆乔的英雄!
Oh, my God! That's Samurai Hank! The Hero of Kakamucho!

788
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,480
贵宾吗?那是什么意思?
Vip? What's that mean?

789
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,640
V-I-P 非常重要的狗 
V-I-P. Very important pooch.

790
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,760
在你之后 我没有任何证件 
After you. I-I don't have any ID.

791
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,880
你有比身份更好的东西 你有名人!
You have something better than ID, you have celebrity!

792
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,160
等等!
Wait!

793
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,600
能给我签个名吗 汉克?
Can I have your autograph, Hank?

794
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,400
嗯…确定吗?
Um... sure?

795
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,520
这就是当老大的意义所在 
Now this is what being a top dog is all about.

796
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,720
私人表,汉克?狗治疗,汉克?
Private table, Hank? Dog treat, Hank?

797
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,160
抓耳朵后面 汉克?
Scratch behind your ears, Hank?

798
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,440
哦,我的上帝!我们能和你合个影吗?
Oh, my God! Can we take a picture with you?

799
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,720
你看起来热 谁会舔你的头发?
You look hot. Who licks your hair?

800
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,800
谢谢你,汉克!
Thank you, Hank!

801
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,680
你是我最喜欢的武士!
You're my favourite samurai!

802
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,640
这是我承诺的全部吗?
Is it everything I promised?

803
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,000
别误会我 这一切都太棒了 
Don't get me wrong, this is all so fantastic.

804
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,080
它只是…你不会觉得我是在追求荣耀吧?
It's just... You don't think that I'm being a glory-seeker, do you?

805
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,680
汉克 不要错过任何一个表扬自己的机会 
Hank, never miss an opportunity to pat yourself on the back.

806
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,200

这里发生了什么?
What happened here?

820
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,440
忍者昨晚又出现了

你去哪儿了?和老板玩得开心

822
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,960
你呢?这是我最后一次违背誓言 
What about you? I failed my oath for the last time.

823
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,520
我的刀在哪里?
Where's my sword?

824
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,960
正确的 
Right.

825
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,120
他们把相扑关进了堡垒地牢 
They've taken Sumo to the fortress dungeon,

826
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,960
现在我要把他找回来
and now I'm going to get him back.

827
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,360
我和你一起去 我们都是武士 这就是我们…
I'll go with you. We're both samurai, and that's what we...

828
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,080
你不是武士!
You are not samurai!

829
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,560
你是个自私的白痴 
You were a selfish idiot.

830
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,160
今天 你什么都不是 
Today, you are nothing.

831
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,760
你只是不想承认我打败了相扑 
You just don't want to admit that I beat Sumo.

832
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,560
你永远不会……你真的相信吗?
You never... Do you really believe that?

833
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,760
毛豆是你最大的胜利 
Edamame was responsible for your greatest victory.

834
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,320
毛豆吗?这有什么关系…
Edamame? What does that have to do...

835
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,760
我没教好 你没学好 
I failed to teach, and you failed to learn.

836
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,040
我从你身上学到了很多 
I've learned a lot from you.

837
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,760
就像当事情变得棘手时 你可以躲在瓶底 
Like when things get tough, you can hide at the bottom of a bottle.

838
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,680
抱歉 金宝 我不是那个意思 
I'm sorry, Jimbo, I-I didn't mean that.

839
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,760
金宝 你骑得倒了 
Jimbo, you're on the horse backwards.

840
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,560
再见,狗 
Goodbye, Dog.

841
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,880
见到你,猫 
See you, Cat.

842
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,520
你去哪了 伟大的武士?!
Where were you, great samurai?!

843
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,480
嘿 不用谢!
Hey, thanks for nothing!

844
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,560
因为你猜怎么着?你什么都没做!
'Cause guess what? You did nothing!

845
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,080
我在讽刺地感谢你!
And I'm thanking you sarcastically!

846
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,680
很好 我要走了 
Good, I'm outta here.

847
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,680
我要搭第一艘船回家 
Going to get on the first boat and get home.

848
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,120
这是正确的 走吧!
That's right. Go!

849
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,000
Emiko……回家!
Emiko... Go back home!

850
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,240
也许我妈妈是对的 也许狗不能当武士!
Maybe my mom was right. Maybe dogs can't be samurai!

851
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,800
“它会一直提醒你 你是谁” 
"It will always remind you of who you are".

852
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,520
啊!你在这里做什么?
Ahh! What are you doing here?

853
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,760
我控制不住自己 我是一只狗 
I couldn't help myself. I'm a dog.

854
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,400
这让我很忠诚 
That makes me loyal.

855
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,000
所以 我是来纠正错误的 
So, I'm here to make things right.

856
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,280
你真以为你还能回来吗
You really think you can just come back here

857
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,720
这样就万事大吉了吗?
and that makes everything OK?

858
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,760
事实上 我知道 我回来了!
As a matter of fact, I do. I'm back!

859
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
你应该高兴!好吧,我不是 
You should be happy! Well, I'm not.

860
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,416
你还不如转身回到你来的地方去 
And you might as well turn around and go back where you came from.

861
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,760
我哪也不去!
I'm not going anywhere!

862
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,480
相扑在里面 不把他救出来我是不会走的!
Sumo is in there, and I'm not leaving until we get him out!

863
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,160
我们可以以后再解决分歧 
We can resolve our differences later.

864
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,440
现在该做什么?
What now?

865
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,360
你用聪明战胜了力量 
You defeat strength with smart.

866
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,080
有人教我的 
Somebody taught me that.

867
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,200
嗯…你有什么想法吗?
Um... do you have any ideas?

868
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,800
啊!
Ahh!

869
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,840
这是聪明的?
This is smart?

870
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,960
啊!
Ahhhh!

871
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,520
小心你的背后!
Watch your back!

872
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,560
你在乎!
You do care!

873
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,600
只是为了拯救相扑 
Only about saving Sumo.

874
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,560
你 我没有你也可以 
You, I could do without.

875
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,520
哇!
Woo!

876
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,880
现在怎么办呢?
Now what?

877
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,720
我们得想办法进去 
We have to figure out a way in.

878
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
好主意 是吧?别摇尾巴了 
Pretty good idea, huh? Stop wagging your tail.

879
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,400
我没说这是个好主意 我只是说它不差 
I didn't say it was a good idea, I just said it doesn't suck.

880
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,920
啊…
Ugh...

881
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,960
好吧,天才 哪条路?
Alright, genius. Which way?

882
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,680
到左边 
To the left.

883
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,360
你有什么发现?
What do you got?

884
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,080
有个快递员已经去世了
Got a D.O.G. who's D.O.A.

885
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,800
想把他藏起来 p d q
Want to get him out of sight P.D.Q.

886
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,240
贵司啊?好的 
A.S.A.P. Huh? OK.

887
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,520
我甚至都不是全职保安!
I'm not even a full-time security guard!

888
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,120
我只是个临时工!噢!
I'm just a temp! Ooh!

889
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,880
让我们滚,狗 
Let's roll, Fido.

890
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,520
好吧……
OK...

891
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,640
这可能会很困难 可能需要一段时间 
Now this could be difficult and might take a while.

892
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,440
我们分头行动吧 我来算面积
So, let's split up. I'll take the areas

893
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,720
北面和西面 你往南走 往东走 
to the north and west. You go south and east.

894
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,680
让我们试着按部就班地处理这件事 
Let's try to be methodical about this.

895
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,360
这里可能有成千上万个细胞 这可能需要几个小时 
There could be thousands of cells here and this could take hours,

896
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,720
也许天 
maybe days.

897
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,200
他就在这里 
He's right over here.

898
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,520
嘿,相扑!我们是来救你的 
Hey, Sumo! We're here to save you.

899
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,640
我想我们应该偷些钥匙 
Guess we should have stolen some keys.

900
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,280
往后站 
Stand back.

901
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,360
至少你试过了 
Well, at least you tried.

902
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,800
小狗的门 
Doggie door.

903
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,160
"救他"的问题有点复杂 
Ah, complication in the "saving him" department.

904
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,960
汉克 没必要救相扑 
Hank, no need to save Sumo.

905
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,520
相扑只是生命海洋中的大虾 
Sumo's just prawn in ocean of life.

906
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,960
我们当然要救你!你是我们的朋友 
Of course we have to save you! You're our friend.

907
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,400
朋友吗?
Friends?

908
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,960
相扑战胜情感!
Sumo overcome with emotion!

909
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,960
虽然我很感激你们的兄弟情谊
While I appreciate the bro-fest,

910
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,320
我们该走了 
we should probably get out of here.

911
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,920
等一下 我要标记我的地盘 
Wait a second, I've gotta mark my territory.

912
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,680
我们没时间了!但是…这是狗的事 
We don't have time for that! But... It's a dog thing.

913
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,440
我想让他们知道我来过!我昨晚还吃了芦笋 
I want them to know I was here! I even had asparagus last night.

914
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,280
我们没时间了!我们得回到卡卡穆乔!
We don't have time! We have to get back to Kakamucho!

915
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,880
等我们到了那里 有什么计划?
And when we get there, what's the plan?

916
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,680
此时此刻 我们做什么并不重要 因为它是…
At this moment, it is not so important what we do. As it is...

917
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,760
.．.重要的是我们要做些什么 
...important that we do something.

918
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,000
还不确定那东西是什么 
Not sure yet what that something is.

919
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,040
嘘!
Shh!

920
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,560
嗯?
Huh?

921
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,880
记住 恐惧只存在于你的脑海中!
Remember, fear is only in your mind!

922
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,720
还有我的和服 
And a little bit in my kimono.

923
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,320
吉米!
Jimbo!

924
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,520
吉米!不!你们两个都给我出去 
Jimbo! No! Both of you, get out of here.

925
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,640
你呢?别担心我 
What about you? Don't worry about me.

926
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,400
你得回到卡卡穆乔那里 
You have to get back to Kakamucho.

927
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,800
但我们是一个团队 
But we're a team.

928
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,320
没有 我必须这么做
No. I have to do this,

929
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,840
“我”里没有团队 
and there is no team in "I".

930
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,760
但武士里有个"我"
But there is an "I" in samurai!

931
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,240
啊!
Ahh!

932
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,680
不!
No!

933
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,800
你不能死!
You can't die!

934
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,720
我们的问题还没有解决!
Our issues aren't resolved yet!

935
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,960
海姆利希余地 
Heimlich manoeuvre.

936
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,520
哦……你救了我的命!
Oh... You saved my life!

937
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,000
但是你碰了我!
But you touched me, ugh!

938
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,840
如果这种事再发生 就让我死吧 好吗?
If that ever happens again, let me die. OK?

939
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,480
现在 它是什么?犯人逃走了 
Now, what is it? The prisoner escaped.

940
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,520
啊 你泄露了秘密 是吗?
Ah, you let the big cat out of the bag, didn't you?

941
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,520
当然了 对的,好吧!
Of course you did. Right, OK!

942
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,040
现在 有人要为此付出代价了 
Now, someone is going to pay for this.

943
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,560
我没说是谁 但可能是个非常非常愚蠢的人 
I'm not saying who, but probably someone very, very stupid.

944
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,200
你知道什么是替罪羊吗 大贺?
Do you know what a scapegoat is, Ohga?

945
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,760
没有 但如果这附近有山羊 
No, but if there's a goat around here,

946
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,760
我会立刻逮捕他 
I will have him arrested immediately.

947
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,800
啊 不用动脑子 绝对……
Ugh. Brainless. Absolute...

948
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,680
这也适用于你们所有人 
And that goes for all of you.

949
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,280
无论如何,不要介意 
Anyway, never mind.

950
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,880
我已经有另一个计划进展顺利了 
Um, I already have another plan progressing nicely.

951
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,280
一个更大的计划 后果更严重 
A much bigger plan with even more deadly consequences.

952
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,320
啊!
Ugh!

953
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,840
大人 请原谅打扰!
My lord, pardon the intrusion!

954
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,160
呃 这是什么?这是超级碗!
Ugh, what is it? It's the super bowl!

955
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,480
满溢的!
It's overflowing!

956
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,640
噢!摇晃处理!摇晃处理!
Oh! Jiggle the handle! Jiggle the handle!

957
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,480
每个人都要在哪里?
Where's everyone going?

958
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,560
Emiko !发生了什么? !
Emiko! What's going on?!

959
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,640
Emiko ! ?Emiko !
Emiko!? Emiko!

960
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,480
看看这个 你读过吗?
Look at this. Have you read this?

961
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,680
没有 你能读给我听吗?
No. Well, would you read it to me?

962
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,000
帮助想要的 杀死卡卡穆乔的恶毒杀手 
Help wanted. Vicious killers for the destruction of Kakamucho.

963
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,560
必须有犯罪前科 一个机会平等的雇主 
Prior criminal record a must. An equal opportunity employer.

964
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,056
难道你看不出来这只是一只绝望的猫最后的举动吗?
Can't you see that this is just the last act of a desperate cat?

965

It's a metaphor. Saying we are all the same.

1010

外表看起来不同 但我们可以自己选择
Look different on the outside, but we can choose for ourselves

1011
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,560

01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,840
我们可以用折叠的纸做任何东西

Everyone get plenty to eat? You can't crush the innocent

1023

享受主菜吧 因为甜点是死亡和毁灭 
Enjoy the entree, because dessert is death and destruction.

1025
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,120

Who knew an evil army could go through so many beans?

1026
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,040

In-laws you don't pick.

1100
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,760
朋友,你选择 而你 金宝 是我的朋友 
Friends, you choose. And you, Jimbo, are my friend.

1101
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,000
那么 你原谅我了?
So, you forgive me?

1102
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,080
原谅 遗忘 没什么大不了的 
Forgiven, forgotten, no biggie.

1103
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,040
嘿,生命的短暂 喜欢我 让我们继续前进!
Hey, life's short. Like me. Let's move on!

1104
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,080
那只狗怎么了?
So, what's up with the dog?

1105
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,640
那只“狗”在保护卡卡穆乔 
That "dog" was defending Kakamucho.

1106
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,480
一只狗在保卫小镇?为什么?
A dog defending the town? Why?

1107
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,480
因为伊卡大人想把它处理掉 
Because Lord Ika here was trying to get rid of it.

1108
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,856
不相信他 我只是想摆脱那条狗!
Don't believe him. I was just trying to get rid of that dog!

1109
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,160
你看到了什么?耐克鞋只是想摆脱这只狗 
You see? Nike Shoe was only trying to get rid of the dog.

1110
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,960
但是先生 那只狗不是你想的那样 
But sir, that dog isn't what you think he is.

1111
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,160
他不是吗?我没听懂 
He isn't? I'm not following you.

1112
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,400
有人能解释一下吗?请允许我……
Can someone else explain this? Allow me...

1113
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,816
Ika Chu想要摆脱这只狗
Ika Chu wanted to get rid of the dog

1114
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,600
因为他妨碍了他的计划
because he was getting in the way of his plan

1115
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,320
用来吓唬卡卡穆乔的猫
to frighten the cats of Kakamucho

1116
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,560
这样他就能把他们的小镇从地图上抹去
so that he could wipe their town off the map

1117
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,840
为了使他的宫殿绝对完美 
in order to make his palace absolutely perfect.

1118
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,640
世界卫生大会……?
Wha...?

1119
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,160
我遗漏了什么吗?
Did I leave anything out?

1120
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,400
大脑?
Brains?

1121
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,400
好吧,躲猫猫…你有什么要说的吗?
Well, Peek-a-boo... what've you got to say for yourself?

1122
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,720
你想要一个解释?你会得到一个 
You want an explanation? You're going to get one.

1123
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,200
我是……
I am...

1124
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,800
逃跑!
running away!

1125
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,280
看来我们得再来点武士战了 
Looks like we got a little more samuraiing to do.

1126
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,320
嗯?
Huh?

1127
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,240
啊!
Ugh!

1128
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,040
哦,你……
Oh, you...

1129
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,160
等等 等等 停 停 停!
Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop!

1130
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,320
对 我有很重要的事要告诉你 汉克 
Right. I have something very important to tell you, Hank.

1131
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,760
它是什么?
What is it?

1132
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,320
我是你的父亲 
I am your father.

1133
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,160
不,你不是 不,我不是 
No, you're not. No, I'm not.

1134
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,520
哈哈哈!
Ha ha ha!

1135
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,360
我干扰你!
I distracted you!

1136
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,080
我绝对不会被一只愚蠢的狗骗过
I'm certainly not about to get outwitted by a stupid dog

1137
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,880
他甚至不是一个真正的武士!
who's not even a real samurai!

1138
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,320
哦 你错了 
Oh, but you're wrong.

1139
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,760
我是一个真正的武士 
I am a real samurai.

1140
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,640
我这有个杯子就说明了这一点 
I got a cup right here that says so.

1141
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,040
啊!
Ahh!

1142
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,120
啊!
Ahh!

1143
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,160
抓住!
Grab on!

1144
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,840
啊!
Ugh!

1145
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,880
不!不,看,大贺典雄!
No! No, see, Ohga!

1146
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,840
你不明白这个概念 对吧?
You don't understand this concept, do you?

1147
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,280
我会救你的!
I will save you!

1148
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,480
哦,我的天!
Oh, my!

1149
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,680
不,不,不!哦……
No, no, no! Oh...

1150
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,120
冲什么? !
What the flush?!

1151
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,040
大贺 你和我有同样的感觉吗?
Ohga, are you feeling what I'm feeling?

1152
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,520
我,先生 
I am, sir.

1153
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,440
塔尔她吹!
Thar she blows!

1154
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,360
这座宫殿要炸了 
This palace is gonna blow.

1155
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,520
当它发生的时候 所有的水都会直接流向…
And when it does, all this water's going straight down to...

1156
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,840
Kakamucho !
Kakamucho!

1157
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,840
我们能做什么?我们没有多少时间了!
What can we do? We don't have much time!

1158
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,760
我们得做点什么!
We've gotta do something!

1159
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,440
,谢谢!
One, please!

1160
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,600
伙计们!你得帮帮我!
Guys! You gotta help me!

1161
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,400
巨大的马桶溢出来了!
The giant toilet is overflowing!

1162
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,240
你试过摇把手吗!
Have you tried to jiggle the handle?!

1163
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,840
太晚了!但我有个主意!
Too late for that! But I have an idea!

1164
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,200
我们倾听!但你最好快点!
We're listening! But you better make it snappy!

1165
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,560
我知道我们之间有分歧 但我觉得那个时候
I know we've had our differences, but I feel like the times

1166
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,240
我们一起工作 取得了很多成就 
we've actually worked together we've really accomplished a lot,

1167
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,280
所以如果你相信我 我想我们可以拯救小镇!
so if you trust me I think we can save the town!

1168
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,640
那真是太棒了!
That was pretty snappy!

1169
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,280
你想让我们怎么做?
What do you want us to do?

1170
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,120
挖!
Dig!

1171
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,600
但是猫不挖!
But cat's don't dig!

1172
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,520
好吧 所以你不挖 你会游泳吗?
OK, so you don't dig. Can you swim?

1173
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,480
你听到他说的了 挖!
You heard him, dig!

1174
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,200
快点!
Hurry up!

1175
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,680
不!
No!

1176
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,520
他们在哪儿?他们在哪儿?
Where are they? Where are they?

1177
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,760
救命,救命!
Help, help!

1178
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,360
的帮助!
Help!

1179
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,240
Emiko !
Emiko!

1180
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,400
我有你!
I've got you!

1181
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,120
好了 事情差不多结束了 
Well, that pretty much wraps things up.

1182
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,760
整整85分钟 
Almost 85 minutes exactly.

1183
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,440
剩下的就是为卡卡穆乔任命一个新的武士了 
All that's left is appointing a new samurai for Kakamucho.

1184
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,400
你说呢 金宝?
Well, what do you say, Jimbo?

1185
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,760
我,我的主?嘿,为什么不呢?
Me, my Lord? Hey, why not?

1186
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,400
我想不出更好的人了 你能吗?
I can't think of anyone better. Can you?

1187
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,080
我能 Kakamucho已经有一个武士了 
I can. Kakamucho already has a samurai.

1188
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,840
这只狗吗?他不可能是武士!他哪儿也不可能去 
The dog? He can't be a samurai! He can't be anywhere.

1189
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,840
这是法律 你知道规则!
It's the law. You know the rules!

1190
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,880
不允许狗 这不是个人 
No dogs allowed. It's not personal.

1191
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,520
这只是生意 你知道他们是怎么说的
It's just business. And you know what they say:

1192
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,160
没有业务……
There's no business...

1193
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,200
.．.像将军业务!Exact-ally !
...like Shogun business! Exact-ally!

1194
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,480
但他不是狗 
But he's not a dog.

1195
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,960
他的……他是我的朋友 
He's... he's my friend.

1196
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,480
更重要的是 他是我们的武士 
And more than that, he's our samurai.

1197
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,160
他是吗?
He is?

1198
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,960
这就是我想告诉你的 
That's what I was trying to tell you.

1199
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,880
哇 你有九条命 你能看到一切 
Wow. You live nine lives, you get to see everything.

1200
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,160
谁知道呢 一个狗武士?
Who knew, a dog samurai?

1201
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,880
汉克不是狗武士 
Hank is not a dog samurai.

1202
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,760
汉克是个伟大的武士!
Hank is a great Samurai!

1203
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,280
一个真正伟大的武士!
A truly great samurai!

1204
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,240
汪 汪 汪 汪!
Woof, woof, woof, woof!

1205
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:40,400
那么我给你起名叫……Kakamucho的武士镇 
Then I dub thee... Town Samurai of Kakamucho.

1206
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,920
呃……事实上 你已经正式任命他了 
Eh... Actually, you already officially appointed him.

1207
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,080
我做了吗?
I did?

1208
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,160
我有一个正式的武士杯什么的 
I had an official samurai cup and everything.

1209
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,760
如果你有个正式的杯子什么的 
Oh, well, if you had an official cup and everything,

1210
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,680
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what that means,

1211
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,800
但我打赌你没有正式的剑!
but I bet you don't have an official sword!

1212
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,480
等等,请稍等!
Wait, please wait!

1213
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,560
谢谢你！但我不能接受这个 
Thank you. But I can't accept this hon our.

1214
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,520
为什么不呢?是的,为什么不呢?
Why not? Yeah, why not?

1215
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,160
我和我的老师有合同
I have a contract with my teacher

1216
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,560
说明我还没有完成训练
that says I haven't yet finished my training.

1217
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,800
但还有另外一个人最配得上我们的荣誉 
But there is someone else that's most deserving of this hon our.

1218
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,520
Emiko 你是个真正的武士 
Emiko. You are a true samurai.

1219
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,280
小吗?是的,我的主 
The little one? Yes, my Lord.

1220
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,560
她一直在保卫这座城市 
She's always defended the town.

1221
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,440
我会把它和我们的 
I will carry it with hon our.

1222
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,400
我知道你会的 
I know you will.

1223
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,800
Emiko !
Emiko!

1224
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,520
当一名真正的武士是什么感觉?
So, how does it feel to be a real samurai?

1225
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,240
很好 但没我成为将军时的感觉好 
Good, but not as good as it will feel someday when I'm the shogun.

1226
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,440
将军吗?你吗?
The shogun? You?

1227
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,360
你知道吗?
You know something?

1228
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,400
这主意不错 当然,为什么不呢?
That ain't such a bad idea. Sure, why not?

1229
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,640
我要告诉你…当将军真好!
And I gotta tell ya... It's good to be the shogun!

1230
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,560
牛奶的我!
Milk's on me!

1231
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,080
挺暖心的 不是吗?
Kind of warms your heart, doesn't it?

1232
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,800
啊!噢!
Ugh! Ow!

1233
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,760
那是什么?保护你自己!
What's that for? Defend yourself!

1234
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,640
噢!等待,等待,停!
Ow! Wait, wait, stop!

1235
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,760
停止,停止,不 时间t 不!
Stop, stop, no. T-Time out. No!

1236
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,640
这伤害了!问题了!哈哈!
That hurts! Gotcha again! Haha!

1237
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,680
噢!感觉如何?
Ow! How does that feel?

1238
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,040
这是我最喜欢的部分 你受苦的部分!
This is my favourite part. The part where YOU suffer!

1239
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,320
接住 接住!
Take that, take that!

1240
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,040
哦,明白了!
Ah, gotcha again!

1241
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,520
嘿 现在是谁在捣鬼?来吧!来吧!
Hey, who's doing the whacking now? C'mon! C'mon!

1242
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,520
这个世界上有很多猫 但没有人会追自己的尾巴 
There's lots of cats in this world, but nobody chases tails, his own,

1243
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,680
或者其他像汉克一样优秀的人
or anybody else as good as Hank.

1244
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,520
他好像有九条命 而且活得好好的
It's like he's got nine lives, and he's living them all

1245
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,240
在同一时间 
at the same time.

1246
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,800
到最后 
And to the fullest.

1247
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,680
狗,什么?汉克是条狗?
What, a canine? Hank is a dog?

1248
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,520
我们不是在唱一只猫吗 
I thought we were singing about a cat.

1249
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,200
他是最酷的猫 而他恰好是一只狗 
He's the coolest cat, who happens to be a dog.

1250
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,960
Nuh-uh,没门!我们要走了!
Nuh-uh, no way! We're out of here!

1251
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,040
流口水的狗不可能是武士!拜托!
A slobbering dog can't be no samurai! Please!

1252
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,120
因为你会让他们看到…
Cause you're gonna show 'em all...

1253
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,320
即使你是一只狗 
Even if you're a dog.

1254
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,520
呃,dog-gone它 
Ugh, dog-gone it.

1255
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,400
不动 至少我不用拍续集了 
Still. At least I don't have to do the sequel.
