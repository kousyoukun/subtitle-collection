Remember, you defeat strength
 with smart.

That just happened!
 I'm a bad dog!

827
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,120
Did you see what I just did there?
 It was beautiful!

828
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,640
Mm-hmm, and I would say
 congratulations,

829
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,920
but since you're already
 doing that yourself...

let's get him to a doctor.

831
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Absolutely. Gotta do that.

832
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,040
I might have really hurt him,
 I mean, look at him!

Didn't feel a thing.

 by my own strength.

There's a new sheriff
 in town, alright?

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,280
Better not let me catch you
 breaking the law again, you feel me?

848

You're free to go.

 in Kakamucho with Hank.

I wanted to say thank you
 for defeating Sumo.

00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,800
And you are welcome.
 Only one thing...

857
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,160
We can never talk on the street
 or anything like that.

 look right, you being a...

We wanted to give you something.

We?

869
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,960
So... your mom wanted
 to throw me a bone?

870
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
No. My mom said to hand it to you.

871
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,760
Now, why would she do that?
 Well, if I threw it,

872
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,640
it might get on the ground
 all dirty and icky.

873
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,320
No, what I meant is why would
 she want to give me something?

874
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,040
To thank you for saving our town.

875

You are the best dog samurai
 I have ever seen.

876

I am the only dog samurai
 you have ever seen.

877
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,880
But I gotta say, you're kinda right.

878
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,200
I am mighty impressive,
 as far as samurais go.

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,160
Are you all finished?
 'Cause it's getting late,

and samurai needs his sleep.

Really looks like things
 are turning around for me, eh?

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,960
You got lucky, kid.
 Don't let it go to your head.

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400
Luck? Please...

What do you mean,
 your ninjas are afraid?

888
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,800
Um... since that dog defeated Sumo,

889
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,160
none of my cats want to...
 The Shogun will be here

in two days! I don't care
 if your ninja are afraid,

891
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,360
take them down to that
 road block of a town

Yes, but no.

 by employing that dog.

there are too many
 good citizens in Kakamucho.

It's a hat.

And this one's a boat!
 That is really good!

907
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,680
Oops, that was the hat.
 What did you make?

908
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,240

Oh wow, that's amazing.

You can make anything
 out of folded paper.

912

Alright, make me a sandwich.
 It's not a sandwich, but here...

913
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,000
I made you something.

914
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,920
For good luck.

915
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,000
It looks like me.

916
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,120
It will always remind you
 of who you are.

917

Who you are? Let's concentrate
 on who you are not!

918
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,320
And that would be a samurai!

919

Come on, Jimbo. We're just
 enjoying a beautiful day.

920

The sun is shining,
 birds are singing.

921
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,400
And besides, I deserve a break
 for taking care of Sumo.

922
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,680
I mean, just look at him.

923

What?
 What?

928
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,280
What?

929
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,360
The point is, this is no time
 for celebrating!

930
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,920
It's time to double your efforts
 and train even harder!

931

00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,200
Oh, sorry.
 I'm not bothering you. Am I?

936
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,400
No, no, no, I was just,
 you know, getting a work out in.

00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,880
Sure. Cor! Very impressive,

Aw, it was nothing.
 Ah, sure it was...

940
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,880
nothing. Anyway, I came here

941

to invite you out on the town
 to celebrate.

Tonight, I'm taking you

943
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,800
to the most exclusive club
 in the country.

944

Even the members aren't allowed in.

Wow! Thank you!
 But I can't go, I...

946
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,600
I promised my teacher I'd stay
 focused on my training.

947
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
Right. Sounds like
 your teacher is someone

948
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,680
who's unhappy and wants
 everyone else to be unhappy too.

949
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,080
You know? Do you like fun?
 You like fun, don't you?

950
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
Of course I like fun!
 Fun is so fun!

951
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,240
Fun is fun, isn't it? (CHUCKLES)
 The clue is in the word.

952
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,600
Drive! Bye! See you later!
 Have fun.

953
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,840
It's just one night.
 It's not a big deal.

954
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,280
It is a big deal.

955
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,200
It's the only deal.

956
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,640
You committed to me to go
 to the end,

957
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,240
and I did the same for you.

958
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,720
You are breaking your word.

959
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,280
I am not breaking my word.

960
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,160
We can start training again
 tomorrow.

961
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,440
But tonight, I'm going to have
 some fun with my boss.

962
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,640
I am your boss.
 What?

963
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,320
I am your boss!

964
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,720
My boss?
 I tell you what to do,

965
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,840
and you do it.

966
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,520
I thought you were my friend.

967
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,640
I am your teacher. Your mentor.

968
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,560
As I told you when we met,
 I am not your friend!

969
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,400
A Samurai has only duty,
 not friends!

970
