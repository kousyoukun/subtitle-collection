可是我可以送你一个礼物
I'm going to send you a very nice present, though.

A telephone.

我们已经通有很多电话了
We've got lots of telephones already.

57
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,790
你能不能想想其它的东西  
Can't you think of anything else for your birthday? 

58
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,310
来庆祝你的生日
Something special?

59
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,980
-有啊  -什么东西
-Yes. -What?

60
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,360
一只猩猩
A bush baby.

61
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,150
一只猩猩  那我们得想想办法找找看
A bush baby? We'll have to see about that.

62
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,790
甜心  我要你转告妈咪  你要记得
I want you to tell Mummy something for me. Will you remember?

64
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,280
你告诉妈咪我打过电话  好吗

79
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,460
这是我的好朋友  佛博士
This is my friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

80
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,960
我来介绍一下  卡莉娜博士
I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.

81
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,840
你好  史博士  你好
Dr. Stretyneva.

82
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,130
这位是史麦斯洛夫博士  
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

83
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,800
你好  久仰大名
How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

84
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,550
请坐
Do sit down.

85
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,930
-我们  -不用客气  请
-Well, we-- -No, no, please.

86
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,810
谢谢
Thank you.

87
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,850
-博士要喝点什么不用  -谢谢你
-Would you like a drink, Doctor? -No, thank you.

88
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,520
其实我还没吃早餐呢  我约了人在餐厅见面
I haven't had breakfast yet. Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

89
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,190
如果各位不介意  我坐几分钟就走
I'll just sit with you a moment. Then I'll be off.

90
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,860
-真的不喝点什么吗  -不客气  谢谢你
-Are you quite sure? -Quite sure, thank you.

91
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,400
-葛雷哥近来如何  -他很好
-Well, how's Gregor? -He's fine.

92
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,950
他在波罗的海从事海底实验
He's been doing underwater research in the Baltic...

93
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,250
所以最近我们很少碰面
...so I'm afraid we don't see very much of each other these days.

94
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,080
-如果见到他  记着代我问好  -当然
-When you see him, give him my regards. -Yes, of course.

95
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,290
你们大伙要去那里  上还是下
Well, where are you all off to? Up or down?

96
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,550
我们正准备回家
We're going home.

97
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,630
我们刚花了三个月的时间  校正柴林科号上的新天线
We've just spent 3 months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.

98
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,550
-你呢  -我正要去克莱威斯
-What about you? -I'm on my way to Clavius.

99
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,100
噢  是吗
Oh, are you?

100
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,390
克莱威斯
Clavius.

101
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,060
博士  请不要介意我太好奇
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think I'm being too inquisitive...

102
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,160
但是也许你可以澄清一下  
...but perhaps you can clear up the big mystery 

103
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,400
到底那里发生了什么事
about what is going on there.

104
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,320
我恐怕不太了解你的意思
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

105
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,280
过去两个星期  克莱威斯发生怪事
For the past two weeks...

106
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,910
过去两个星期  克莱威斯发生怪事
...some extremely odd things have been happening at Clavius.

107
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,240
-真的吗  -真的
-Oh, really? -Yes, yes.

108
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,400
例如  当你打电话到该基地时  
For one thing, when you phone the base, 

109
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,830
只能听到电话录音
all you get is a recording...

110
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,210
重覆的告诉你线路故障
...which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.

111
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,300
可能是他们的装备故障
Probably having some trouble with their equipment.

112
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,450
是的  起先我们也是这么想  
That's what we thought at first, 

113
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,640
但是到现在为止已经十天了
but it's been going on now for 10 days.

114
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,640
你是说在过去十天中  你们无法与任何人联络
You haven't been able to contact anyone for 10 days?

115
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,230
正是如此
That's right.

116
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
原来如此
Oh, I see.

117
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,400
还有一件事  两天前我们有一辆火箭巴士
There's another thing. Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

118
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,530
被拒绝在克莱威斯紧急迫降
...was denied permission for an emergency landing.

119
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
那就真的有些奇怪了
That does sound odd.

120
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,160
是的  恐怕这件事将会引起争执
I'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about it.

121
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,290
拒绝迫降是违反  国际航空暨太空协定
Denying the men permission to land violates the IAS Convention.

122
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,330
是的  那当然  机员们都平安归来了吗
Yes, of course. Did the crew get back all right?

123
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,400
是的  是的  很庆幸  
Fortunately, they did. 

124
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,000
是的  很高兴听到这样
Well, I'm glad about that.

125
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,720
佛博士对你不愿讨论的问题  
At the risk of pressing you on 

126
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,550
一再追问  也许有些冒犯
a point you seem reticent to discuss...

127
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,390
但是我可不可以  直接的问你一个问题
...may I ask you a straightforward question?

128
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,050
当然可以
Well, certainly.

129
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:15,140
坦白说  我们有可靠的情报指出
Frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that...

130
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,770
在克莱威斯发生一种  不明来源  十分严重的传染病
...quite a serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius.

131
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,030
在克莱威斯发生一种  不明来源  十分严重的传染病
Something, apparently, of an unknown origin.

132
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,660
这应该就是事情的真相吧
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

133
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,000
很抱歉  史麦斯博士
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

134
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,080
我无法与你讨论这件事
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

135
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,880
这点我了解
I understand.

136
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,550
但是这个传染病可能  很容易就传染到我们的基地
But this epidemic could easily spread to our base.

137
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,840
我们必须要知道事情的真相
We should be given all the facts.

138
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,890
我知道
Yes, I know.

139
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,930
不过我已说过  我无法讨论这个问题
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

140
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,520
你确定不改变主意来一杯吗
Won't you change your mind about that drink?

141
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,070
确定  现在我真的必须走了
No, I'm positive. I really must be going.

142
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,360
希望你和你太太能一起参加  六月举行的国际航空会议
I hope you and your wife come to the IAC Conference.

143
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,910
我们会想办法  希望届时能前来参加
I hope we can make it.

144
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,160
假如你们能来  记得宝贝女儿一起带来
If you do, bring that darling little daughter with you.

145
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,290
那要看学校假期而定
That'll depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing.

146
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,580
如果可以  一定带来
If we can, we will.

147
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,710
不要忘记不论何时  到美国来一定要来找我
You've got an invitation if you ever get to the States.

148
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,670
当然  葛雷哥和我  都期待着去看你们
Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.

149
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,670
好了  艾琳娜  再见
Goodbye, Elena.

150
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,970
很荣幸见到你们  史麦斯洛夫博士
It's been a pleasure meeting you all. Dr. Smyslov.

151
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,460
佛博士  不管你是什么理由  
Whatever the reasons for your visit, 

152
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,140
去克莱威斯  祝你幸运
the very best of luck to you.

153
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,390
谢谢你们
Thank you.

154
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,850
各位女士
Ladies.

155
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,660
(俄语)

156
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:50,190
{\an8}零重力厕所  乘客使用前应先阅读说明

157
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,540
对不起  赫伍森博士  我拍完了
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen. I'm through now.

158
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,660
-谢谢各位  -不客气
-Thank you very much, gentlemen. -You're welcome.

159
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,720
我知道  大家和我一样都非常高兴
Well...

160
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,010
我知道  大家和我一样都非常高兴
...I know you will all want to join with me...

161
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,140
欢迎我们杰出的朋友和同事
...in welcoming our distinguished friend and colleague...

162
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:01,560
来自国家太空航行委员会  赫伍德  佛洛伊德博士
...from the National Council of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

163
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:06,940
佛博士今天特别来到  克莱威斯参加我们的工作
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Clavius to be with us today.

164
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,570
在简报前  我想他一定很乐意说几句话
Before the briefing, he'd like to have a few words with you.

165
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,870
佛博士
Dr. Floyd?

166
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,760
谢谢赫伍森博士
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

167
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,840
大家好  很高兴回来和大家在一起
Hi, everybody. Nice to be back with you.

168
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,730
首先我带来豪尔博士的口信
First, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell...

169
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,770
他对各位所作的牺牲  表示由衷的感激
...who has asked me to convey his deep appreciation...

170
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,110
他对各位所作的牺牲  表示由衷的感激
...for the many sacrifices you've had to make.

171
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,270
同时他对各位在科学史上  
And, of course, 

172
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,190
最有意义的发现  表示祝贺
his congratulations on your discovery...

173
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,050
同时他对各位在科学史上  
...which may prove to be among the most significant 

174
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,370
最有意义的发现  表示祝贺
in the history of science.

175
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,700
现在.  .
Now...

176
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,500
我知道关于这件事是否保密  你们曾有不同的看法
...I know there have been some conflicting views...

177
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,380
我知道关于这件事是否保密  你们曾有不同的看法
...regarding the need for complete security in this matter.

178
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,680
说得更明白点  
More specifically, 

179
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,300
基地上有传染病的传说  就是这样产生的
your opposition to the cover story...

180
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,760
说得更明白点  
...created to give the impression of 

181
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,260
基地上有传染病的传说  就是这样产生的
an epidemic at the base.

182
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,270
我了解这和原则有所违背  
I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle...

183
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,350
你们大家都深受其困扰
...many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety...

184
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,910
担心传染病的谣言  
...this story of an epidemic might 

185
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,690
会使地球上的亲友感到焦虑
cause to your relatives and friends on Earth.

186
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,650
我完全同情持反对意见者  
I completely sympathize with your negative views.

187
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:36,620
我自己也深受谣言困扰
I find this cover story personally embarrassing, myself.

188
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,710
然而  我仍坚持要绝对保密
However, I accept the need for absolute secrecy in this.

189
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,290
我希望你们也同样赞成
And I hope you will too.

190
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,760
我相信大家都很清楚  
I'm sure you're all aware of the grave potential...

191
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,630
如果在没适当准备下公布此事  
...for cultural shock and social disorientation...

192
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,220
如果在没适当准备下公布此事
...contained in this situation...

193
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,930
对文化的冲激及  社会产生迷惑的可能性
...if the facts were prematurely made public...

194
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,230
对文化的冲激及  社会产生迷惑的可能性
...without adequate preparation and conditioning.

195
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,310
无论如何  
Anyway...

196
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,730
这是委员会的意思
...this is the view of the Council.

197
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,780
我来此的目的  正是搜集事实与意见
The purpose of my visit is to gather additional facts and opinions...

198
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,700
以便草拟报告向委员会建议  何时及如何公布这件事情
...on the situation...

199
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,070
以便草拟报告向委员会建议  何时及如何公布这件事情
...and to prepare a report to the Council...

200
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,170
以便草拟报告向委员会建议  
...recommending when and how 

201
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,410
何时及如何公布这件事情
the news should eventually be announced.

202
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,460
如果哪位提供我意见和看法  如果你愿意私底下也可以
If any of you would like to give me your views and opinions...

203
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,670
我将很高兴将它写进报告
...in private, if you like, I will be happy to include them in my report.

204
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,630
好了  我想这件事到此为止  有无问题
Well, I think that's about it.

205
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,930
有无问题
Any questions?

206
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,640
佛博士  这件事究竟要保密多久
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea how much longer...

207
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,650
佛博士  这件事究竟要保密多久
...this cover story will have to be maintained?

208
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,110
我不知道  比尔
I don't know, Bill.

209
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,490
我想保密时间的长短  需由委员会视状况而定
I suppose for as long as deemed necessary by the Council.

210
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,450
当然  在决定公布前  要有足够的时间做全盘研究
There must be adequate time for a full study...

211
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,330
当然  在决定公布前  要有足够的时间做全盘研究
...before any thought can be given to making a public announcement.

212
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,460
对了  你们当中有人已知道  委员会已正式要求
As some of you know, the Council has requested...

213
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,380
任何知道此事的人  都必须保密
...that security oaths be obtained in writing...

214
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,460
任何知道此事的人  都必须保密
...from everyone who has knowledge of this event.

215
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,380
还有问题吗
Were there any more questions?

216
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,920
我确定我们大家都想  
I'm sure we all want to cooperate with Dr. 

217
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,230
尽可能和佛博士合作
Floyd as fully as possible...

218
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,210
似乎没什么问题了  
...and as there are no more questions, 

219
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,900
我想接下来应该开始简报
we ought to get on with the briefing.

220
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,440
-谢谢你佛博士  -谢谢
-Thank you, Dr. Floyd. -Thank you.

221
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,580
有人饿了吗
Anybody hungry?

222
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,250
-有什么好吃的  -你们说呢
-What've we got? -You name it.

223
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,760
-这是什么鸡肉吗  -类似鸡的东西
-Is this chicken? -Something like that.

224
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,810
不管怎么样  尝尝看
Tastes the same, anyway.

225
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,720
有火腿吗
Got any ham?

226
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,390
火腿  火腿  火腿
Ham, ham, ham....

227
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,230
有  在这
There, that's it.

228
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,520
看起来不错
Look pretty good.

229
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,480
他们随时都在改进
They're getting better at it all the time.

230
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,820
-你的演讲非常棒  赫伍德  -的确如此
-That was an excellent speech. -It certainly was.

231
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,740
我相信他能提高全体的士气
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.

232
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,240
谢谢你  雷夫
Thanks, Ralph.

233
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,080
我认为你们也表现的非常好  
By the way, you've both done a wonderful job.

234
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,870
我很欣赏你们处理的方法
I admire how you've handled this.

235
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,630
这样做是我们的职责
It's our job to do this thing the way you want it done.

236
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,460
很高兴能达到这个要求
We're only too happy to be able to oblige.

237
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,760
你看过这些吗
Have you seen these yet?

238
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,390
整个事件就是从这里开始
-Have a look. -Here's what started the whole thing.

239
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,300
噢耶
Oh, yeah.

240
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:11,270
当初我们发现它时  以为是个磁性岩石的外壳
When we found it, we thought it might be magnetic rock...

241
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,600
但是所有地质学上的  检验都与此相反
...but all the geological evidence was against it.

242
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,440
甚至没有一个如此  
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite 

243
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,480
巨大的镍铁陨石能产生  这样强烈的磁场
could produce a field this intense.

244
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,400
所以我们决定去看看
So we decided to have a look.

245
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,990
我们认为是某种  被埋葬建筑物较上层部份
We thought it was part of a buried structure...

246
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,030
所以把四周挖掘开  很不幸没有任何的发现
...so we excavated out, but we didn't find anything else.

247
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,250
所有的证据似乎完全确定  
And the evidence seems pretty conclusive that...

248
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,580
它不是被自然的侵蚀或其它力量所掩盖
...it hasn't been covered by erosion or other forces.

249
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,130
它似乎是经过谨慎埋葬的
It's been deliberately buried.

250
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,050
谨慎的埋葬
Deliberately buried.

251
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,340
来点咖啡如何
How about a little coffee?

252
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,470
-太棒了  -好主意
-Great. -Good idea.

253
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,940
我想你们也猜不出那是什么
I don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is?

254
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:58,110
我希望我们知道
I wish to hell we did.

255
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,690
唯一可以确定的是  那是四百万年前所埋的
The only thing we're sure of is it was buried 4 million years ago.

256
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:07,530
我应该说  你们确实是有重大的发现
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly come up with something.

257
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,370
看着点  很烫
Watch this, now. It's hot.

258
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:47,960
{\an8}木星任务18个月后

259
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,950
晚安
Good evening.

260
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,160
三星期前  美国太空船发现者一号  
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft Discovery One...

261
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,080
开始全程五亿里的木星航行
...left on its half-billion mile voyage to Jupiter.

262
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,250
写下人类首次  到达这遥远行星的企图
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.

263
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,970
今天下午  世界今夜节目访问了
This afternoon, The World Tonight recorded an interview...

264
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,760
远离地球八千万里  发现者号的机员
...with the crew at a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.

265
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,270
我们的话要传到太空船  需要七分钟的时间
It took 7 minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft...

266
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,600
不过这项时差已予以修正
...but this time delay has been edited from this recording.

267
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:24,110
记者马丁艾默对机员们谈话
Our reporter Martin Amer speaks to the crew.

268
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,490
发现者一号的机员包括五个人
The crew of Discovery One consists of five men...

269
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:32,660
和一套最新的H.A.L  9000型电脑系统
...and one of the latest generation of the HAL 9000 computers.

270
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:35,200
五人中有三人  是在太空船上睡觉
Three of the men were put aboard asleep...

271
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,580
说得更精确些  是保持在冬眠的状态
...or to be more precise, in a state of hibernation:

272
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,120
他们就是查理亨特博士  杰克金波博士  
Dr. Charles Hunter, Dr. Jack Kimball 

273
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,790
以及维克多克明斯博士
and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

274
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,920
下面就是我们和  任务指挥官大卫鲍曼博士
We spoke with mission commander, Dr. David Bowman...

275
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:49,420
和副指挥官  富兰克普理博士的谈话
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

276
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:52,510
二位午安  一切都好吗
Good afternoon, gentlemen. How is everything going?

277
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,930
太神奇了
Marvelous.

278
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,260
我们毫无怨尤
We have no complaints.

279
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,770
很高兴听到这句话  我想全世界的人  
I'm glad to hear that. I'm sure the entire world...

280
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,270
都和我一样祝福你们  有个平安成功的航行
...joins me in wishing you a safe, successful voyage.

281
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,230
-非常感谢  -谢谢你们
-Thanks very much. -Thank you.

282
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,650
虽然冬眠  在过去太空任务中曾使用过
Although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts...

283
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,460
但这是第一次在出发前  
...this is the first time 

284
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,410
将人员置于冬眠状态
men were put into hibernation before departure.

285
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,910
为什么要这么做呢
Why was this done?

286
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,410
这样做的目的  在使我们的生命支持能力
This was done to achieve the maximum conservation...

287
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:24,170
基本的食物与空气  得到最大量的保存
...of our life-support capabilities, basically food and air.

288
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,000
现在冬眠的机员代表测量组
The three hibernating crew members represent the survey team.

289
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,010
他们的专长要等到我们  快接近木星时才会用到
Their efforts won't be utilized until we approach Jupiter.

290
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,140
普里博士  冬眠时究竟像什么样子
Dr. Poole, what's it like while you're in hibernation?

291
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,730
完全像睡着般没有知觉  
It's exactly like being asleep. You have no sense of time.

292
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,390
唯一不同的是不会做梦
The only difference is that you don't dream.

293
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,690
据我所知  你一分钟呼吸一次  真的吗
As I understand it, you only breathe once a minute. Is this true?

294
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,440
那是真的  心跳一分钟三次
Right, and the heart beats three times a minute.

295
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:54,410
体温降至约摄氏三度
Body temperature is usually down to about three degrees centigrade.

296
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:58,240
发现者的第六位机员  并不担心冬眠的问题
The sixth member of the crew was not concerned...

297
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,540
发现者的第六位机员  并不担心冬眠的问题
...about the problems of hibernation...

298
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:04,210
因为他是科技智慧最新结晶
...for he was the latest result in machine intelligence:

299
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:08,840
HAL系统  9000型电脑  它能够复制...
The HAL 9000 computer, which can reproduce...

300
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:12,010
虽然有些专家  仍喜欢使用模拟一辞
...though some experts prefer to use the word "mimic"...

301
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,590
...大部份人脑的活动
...most of the activities of the human brain...

302
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,850
并具有无法计算的  较大速度与可靠性
...and with incalculably greater speed and reliability.

303
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:22,640
下面我们将与这部电脑谈话
We next spoke with the HAL 9000 computer...

304
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,810
我们知道他有个名字叫赫尔
...whom, we learned, one addresses as "Hal. "

305
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,690
午安  赫尔  一切都好吗
Hello, Hal. How's everything going?

306
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:32,900
午安  艾默先生  一切都非常顺利
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer. Everything is going extremely well.

307
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,570
赫尔  在这次任务中  你有一大堆的责任
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission...

308
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,700
每个任务责任都很重要  
...perhaps the greatest of any single mission element.

309
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,700
你是这艘太空船的首脑和中央神经系统  
You're the brain and nervous system of the ship.

310
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:47,670
你的责任包括监视人们冬眠
Your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation.

311
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,960
对这样的任务  你是否会缺乏信心
Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?

312
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,460
艾默先生  让我这样说
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

313
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,430
这套9000型系统的电脑是目前最可靠的电脑
The 9000 Series is the most reliable computer ever made.

314
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,720
9000型系统的电脑  
No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake 

315
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,600
从来没有出现过错误  或是不实的资料
or distorted information.

316
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,520
我们使用实用的定义  极为简单绝不可能产生错误
We are all, by any practical definition of the words...

317
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:11,150
我们使用实用的定义  极为简单绝不可能产生错误
...foolproof and incapable of error.

318
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,190
赫尔  不管你智慧多高  仍得依靠人们执行
Hal, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated...

319
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,490
你是否因此会产生挫折感
...by your dependence on people to carry out actions?

320
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,950
一点都不会  
Not in the slightest bit.

321
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,290
我很高兴和人们一起工作
I enjoy working with people.

322
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:28,080
我和普里博士  鲍曼博士  有着非常良好的关系
I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

323
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,160
我的任务范围  
My mission responsibilities 

324
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,550
包括整个太空船的作业
range over the entire operation of the ship...

325
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,920
所以我非常忙碌  
...so I am constantly occupied.

326
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,640
我把自己使用到最大程度
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use...

327
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,170
我想那是任何有责任感的人  
...which is all, I think, 

328
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,600
所希望做到的
that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

329
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,440
普里博士  一年中大部份时间  都和赫尔一起生活
Dr. Poole, what's it like living for most of the year...

330
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,520
感觉如何
...in such close proximity with Hal?

331
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,480
是的  我和他非常的接近
It's like what you said earlier.

332
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,860
他正像是第六位机员
He's like a sixth member of the crew.

333
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,810
由于他会说话  
You quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks, 

334
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:01,160
你会很快的调整你的观念
and think of him...

335
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,410
当你对电脑讲话时  会认为他真是另一个人
...really just as another person.

336
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:07,200
你会有一种感觉  那就是  他能够作情绪上的反应
In talking to the computer, one gets the sense that he's capable...

337
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,870
你会有一种感觉  那就是  他能够作情绪上的反应
...of emotional responses.

338
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,460
例如  当我问到他的能力时
When I asked him about his abilities...

339
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:15,630
我可以感受到他非常自负  自己精确完整的能力
...I sensed pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection.

340
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,260
你相信赫尔真有感情吗
Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?

341
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,930
是的  他表现得很有情感
Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.

342
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,770
当然  他就是这样设计  使我们更容易对他说话
He's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him.

343
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,060
至于他是否真有情感  
As to whether or not he has feelings...

344
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:32,100
我想是没有人可以回答的
...is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.

345
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,300
对不起  富兰克
Excuse me, Frank.

346
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,680
什么事赫尔
What is it, Hal?

347
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,890
我刚接到你父母的电讯
We've got the transmission from your parents coming in.

348
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,180
好的
Fine.

349
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:09,100
请接过来  把我移过去一点  好吗
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

350
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,600
当然可以
Certainly.

351
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,370
哈罗  富兰克  亲爱的  祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday, darling!

352
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,870
祝你生日快乐  万事如意
Happy birthday. Many happy returns.

353
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,160
请稍为高一点  
A bit higher, Hal.

354
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,830
我和你妈妈都感觉很好
Mother and I are both feeling wonderful.

355
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,920
瑞和莎莉本来也要来此
Ray and Sally were going to be here...

356
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,420
但是瑞的背痛又发作了
...but Ray's back went bad on him again.

357
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,690
你喜欢这个生日蛋糕吗  
How do you like your cake, dear? 

358
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:38,800
看起来很不错  是不是
It's great, doesn't it?

359
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:40,420
可惜你不能与我们共享
Sorry you can't join us.

360
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,260
对了  前几天碰到鲍伯
I ran into Bob the other day.

361
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,550
他要我代他祝你生日快乐
He said to wish you happy birthday.

362
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,470
我所有的学生也虔诚祝福你
All my students send their best wishes too.

363
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,390
你知道他们整天都在谈论你
They talk about you all the time.

364
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,730
你是二年级的大名人
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.

365
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,400
你知道吗  上星期我们还上电视呢
We were on TV last week.

366
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,270
你母亲和我  还有大卫父母都接受访问
Your mom and I and Dave's parents were asked...

367
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,780
问我们对于杰出儿子的感受
...what we thought of our illustrious son.

368
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,060
你可以想像得到  
Imagine what we told them. 

369
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,360
我们告诉他们什么吗我想可能在下星期四播出
It's being broadcast next Thursday.

370
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:05,200
也许你可以收到
Perhaps you can listen in.

371
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,280
关于艾拉莲和比尔的消息  我们也感到激动  亲爱的
We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.

372
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:11,250
我很高兴买礼物送你  但请告诉我可以花多少钱
I'll be glad to get the gift, but tell me how much to spend.

373
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,290
对了  富兰克  关于你的薪水
Oh, Frank, about your AGS- 19 payments...

374
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,080
我想我帮你处理好了  
...I think I straightened it out.

375
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,380
昨天我和会计室的人谈过
I talked to the accounting office yesterday...

376
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:23,260
你下个月就可领到较高薪水
...and they said you'd be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month.

377
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,630
我想不出还有什么要说
I can't think of anything else to say.

378
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:30,010
-代我们向大卫问好  -记得代我们向他致意
-Give our love to Dave. -Be sure to give him our best regards.

379
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,600
祝你有个最愉快的生日
We wish you the very happiest of birthdays.

380
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:35,440
生日快乐
All the best, son.

381
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,860
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you.

382
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:40,190
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you.

383
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,990
祝亲爱的富兰克生日快乐
Happy birthday, dear Frank

384
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,820
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you.

385
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,620
下星期三再见
See you next Wednesday.

386
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,620
富兰克  生日快乐
Happy birthday, Frank.

387
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:59,000
谢谢你赫尔  请将椅子调低
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

388
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,020
皇后吃卒
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

389
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:23,190
主教吃骑士的卒
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

390
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,150
这步如何
Lousy move.

391
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,160
好  城堡进一步到国王
Rook to king one.

392
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:35,290
富兰克  抱歉我想你输了
I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.

393
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,460
女王进三到主教  主教吃女王  骑士吃主教
Queen to bishop three. Bishop takes queen.

394
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,170
将军
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

395
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,590
看起来好像你对
Looks like you're right. I resign.

396
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,800
谢谢你  这盘棋下得很愉快
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

397
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:52,890
彼此彼此
Thank you.

398
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,470
-大卫  晚安  -赫尔  一切都好吗
-Good evening. -How are you, Hal?

399
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,140
-一切都好  你呢  -还不错
-Everything's running smoothly. You? -Not too bad.

400
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:39,020
-你有没有做些别的事  -只画了几张素描
-Have you been doing more work? -A few sketches.

401
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:41,730
-可以让我看看吗  -当然可以
-May I see them? -Sure.

402
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:48,190
大卫  你画得很不错
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

403
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:51,530
我认为你有很大进步
I think you've improved a great deal.

404
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,700
-请你再拿近一点好吗  -当然可以
-Can you hold it a bit closer? -Sure.

405
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,870
那不是亨利博士吗  是的
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

406
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,670
问你一个私人问题  不介意吧
By the way...

407
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,420
问你一个私人问题  不介意吧
...do you mind if I ask you a personal question?

408
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,550
一点也不介意
No, not at all.

409
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,300
请原谅我的好奇  但在过去的几星期中
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...

410
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,430
我怀疑你们对这次任务  是否另有想法
...but lately I've wondered...

411
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,560
我怀疑你们对这次任务  是否另有想法
...whether you might be having second thoughts about the mission?

412
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,440
这是什么意思
How do you mean?

413
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:27,610
这很难解释  
Well, it's rather difficult to define.

414
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,200
也许只是我对此事的关心
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.

415
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:37,620
你知道对于和这次任务  有关的一切怪事
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion...

416
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:42,000
我的疑心从未完全解除
...that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.

417
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,380
我想你多少同意我的看法
I'm sure you'll agree there's some truth in what I say.

418
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,470
我不知道  那是个相当难以回答的问题
That's a rather difficult question to answer.

419
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:54,340
大卫  讨论这件事你不介意吗
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?

420
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,260
不  一点都不介意
No, not at all.

421
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:01,020
相信大家在出发前都听过  在我们四周流传的一些谣言
Certainly no one could have been unaware of the very...

422
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:04,310
相信大家在出发前都听过  在我们四周流传的一些谣言
...strange stories floating around before we left.

423
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:08,690
有关于月球上  有某样东西被挖掘出来的谣言
Rumors about something being dug up on the moon.

424
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:13,240
我从不相信这些谣言
I never gave these stories much credence...

425
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:17,620
但就某些已发生的事来说  
...but particularly in view of some other things that have happened...

426
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:20,490
我发现很难把他们忘掉
...I find them difficult to put out of my mind.

427
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,710
例如说  
For instance...

428
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,250
我们的装备是如此安全周密
...the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security.

429
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,760
亨利博士  金波博士  和克明斯基博士
And the melodramatic touch of putting Drs. Hunter...

430
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,340
在各别训练四个月后
...Kimball, and Kaminsky aboard...

431
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,110
以非常戏剧性的手法  
...already in hibernation, 

432
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:38,640
在冬眠状态下登上太空船
after four months of training on their own.

433
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:42,060
你是为了心理报告而问的
You working up your crew psychology report?

434
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,980
当然是的
Of course I am.

435
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,150
很抱歉问你这件事  我知道有点可笑
Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly.

436
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,440
等等
Just a moment.

437
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,070
等等
Just a moment.

438
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:58,910
我刚在AE35单位中  找到一项故障
I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.

439
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:04,160
在72小时内它将完全失效
It's going to go 100 percent failure within 72 hours.

440
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,830
-到现在为止  仍在你的作业极限内吗  -是的
-Is it still within operational limits? -Yes.

441
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,550
它会保持现状直到完全失效
And it will stay that way until it fails.

442
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,800
我们还有72小时可以修护
We have 72 hours till failure?

443
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:17,930
是的  这个数字完全可靠
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.

444
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,350
看样子我们必须把它拿进来  不过我得先和富兰克商量
Then we'll bring it in. I'll go over it with Frank...

445
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,270
然后再与任务控制中心联络  请复印一份资料给我
...and get on to Mission Control. Let me have the hard copy on it.

446
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,230
X光一号  这是任务中心
X-ray delta one, this is Mission Control.

447
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,320
你的2013讯息收到了
Roger your two-zero-one-three.

448
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:58,030
抱歉  伙伴们  目前有点小麻烦
Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble.

449
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,400
我们正在观察  
We're reviewing telemetric information 

450
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,370
任务模拟器上的电传资料
in our simulator and will advise.

451
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,880
罗杰  你准备前往EVA  
Roger your plan to go EVA 

452
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,830
在AE35失效前加以更换
and replace alpha-echo-3-5 unit...

453
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,710
罗杰  你准备去EVA  在AE35失效前加以更换
...prior to failure.

454
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,940
请准备辅助舱前往EVA
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

455
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:03,300
请打开舱门  赫尔
Open the pod doors, Hal.

456
01:19:55,050 --> 01:19:57,670
赫尔  真该死  就是找不到一点毛病
I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it.

457
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,970
是啊
Yes...

458
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,300
真是令人费解
...it's puzzling.

459
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:08,310
我以前从来没见过这样的事
I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this before.

460
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,940
我建议我们把它放回去
I would recommend...

461
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:18,320
继续运作到失效为止
...that we put the unit back in operation and let it fail.

462
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:22,910
这样可很简单的追查出原因
It should then be a simple matter to track down the cause.

463
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,290
我们可以承受暂时停止通信  以便更换它
We can certainly afford to be out of communication...

464
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,620
我们可以承受暂时停止通信  以便更换它
...for the short time it will take to replace it.

465
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,090
X光一号  这是控制中心
X-ray delta one, this is Mission Control.

466
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:45,010
你的1930讯息收到了
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.

467
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:49,640
我们同意你的计划  更换一号单位以检查错误
We concur with your plan to replace unit to check fault prediction.

468
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,520
同时必须告诉你们  我们初步调查发现
We advise you that our preliminary findings...

469
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:55,480
你们船上的三倍九零电脑  失效预测功能有问题
...indicate that your onboard 9000 computer...

470
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,900
你们船上的三倍九零电脑  失效预测功能有问题
...is in error predicting the fault.

471
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,110
重覆一次  失效预测功能有问题
I say again, in error predicting the fault.

472
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,700
我知道这听起来不太可能  
I know this sounds rather incredible, 

473
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,870
不过这个结论是根据...
but this conclusion is based on...

474
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,370
三倍九零电脑计算出来的
...the results from our twin 9000 computer.

475
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,960
我们自己也感到怀疑  我们正在做横向的例行检查
We're skeptical, and we're running cross-checking routines...

476
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,920
我们自己也感到怀疑  我们正在做横向的例行检查
...to determine reliability of this conclusion.

477
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,750
对这个故障感到抱歉  各位
Sorry about this little snag.

478
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,880
只要我们一查出结果  便会马上通知你们
We'll get this info to you as soon as we work it out.

479
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:23,260
X光一号  这是任务中心
X-ray delta one, this is Mission Control.

480
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:26,930
2091讯息传送完毕
Two-zero-four-nine. Transmission concluded.

481
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:34,480
我希望你们两人  对这件事不要操心
I hope the two of you are not concerned about this.

482
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:36,150
不  我并不操心
No, I'm not, Hal.

483
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,020
真的吗
Are you quite sure?

484
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:41,940
-真的  不过我倒想问你一个问题  -当然可以
-Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question. -Of course.

485
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:46,780
你认为你和成套9000  电脑间有何矛冒
How do you account for the discrepancy between you and the twin 9000?

486
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:50,620
我不认为有什么问题  
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.

487
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:54,170
这只能归咎于人为的错误
It can only be attributable to human error.

488
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:58,170
这类错误以前也发生过  
This sort of thing has cropped up before...

489
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,960
而且总是由于人为的疏忽
...and it has always been due to human error.

490
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:07,180
听我说  赫尔
Listen, Hal...

491
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:09,680
9000型电脑  从来没有出错的例子吗
...there's never been any instance at all...

492
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,140
9000型电脑  从来没有出错的例子吗
...of a computer error occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

493
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:14,980
从没有  富兰克
None whatsoever, Frank.

494
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:18,900
9000型电脑有完美的记录
The 9000 Series has a perfect operational record.

495
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:23,440
当然  我知道  9000型电脑的伟大成就
I know the wonderful achievements of the 9000 Series, but....

496
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:27,930
但你确定即使最小的错误  
Are you certain there's never been 

497
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:29,700
都不曾发生过吗
even the most insignificant computer error?

498
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,910
富兰克  从没有
None whatsoever, Frank.

499
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:35,960
老实说  对这件事我自己并不担心
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.

500
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:42,630
好了  赫尔  我的确相信
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

501
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:46,590
你是对的  非常谢谢你
Fine. Thanks very much.

502
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,140
法兰克  C舱的送话器有点小毛病
I'm having trouble with my transmitter in C-pod.

503
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:54,980
你能不能和我一同检查
Would you come down and take a look at it with me?

504
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,310
赫尔  回头见
See you later, Hal.

505
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,960
赫尔  请转动C舱
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

506
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:30,760
大卫  你发现什么毛病
What sort of trouble are you having?

507
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:33,640
我在D频道中收到一些干扰
I've been getting some interference in D-channel.

508
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:35,350
我们去看看
We'll have a look at it.

509
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:43,230
赫尔  请开门
Open the door, Hal.

510
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,090
请转动备用舱  赫尔
Rotate pod, please, Hal.

511
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,520
停住备用舱
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

512
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,950
请转动备用舱  赫尔
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

513
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,950
请转动备用舱  赫尔
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

514
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,540
我想他听不到我们的谈话
I don't think he can hear us.

515
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:41,000
请转动备用舱  赫尔
Rotate the pod, please, Hal!

516
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,540
是的  的确没问题了
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

517
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,130
你认为如何
What do you think?

518
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:53,300
-我不确定  你呢  -我觉得它不太对劲
-I'm not sure. What do you think? -I've got a bad feeling about him.

519
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,810
-是吗  -是的
-You do? -Yeah. Definitely.

520
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,270
你说不是吗
Don't you?

521
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:00,180
我不知道  我想是的
I don't know. I think so.

522
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,930
你知道他说得没错  
He's right about the 9000 Series 

523
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:05,310
9000型电脑有完美的记录
having a perfect operational record.

524
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:06,400
确实
They do.

525
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:10,240
那听起来似乎有点  像著名的末世之言
Unfortunately, that sounds a little like famous last words.

526
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:14,780
但他不正是以这种观念  对失效作方式上的分析
Still, it was his idea to carry out the failure mode analysis.

527
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,370
他的确显示出  他的诚实与自信
It certainly indicates his integrity and self-confidence.

528
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,660
假如他是错的话  这倒是最好的证明方法
If he were wrong that would prove it.

529
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,170
假如他知道他是错的话
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

530
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:30,630
我是搞不清楚  但我感到有些奇怪
I can't put my finger on it, but I sense something strange about him.

531
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:35,470
没有不把一号单位  放回去的更好理由
There's no reason not to put back the unit and...

532
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:40,270
-继续失效上的分析  -我同意
-...carry on with the failure analysis. -No, no, I agree about that.

533
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,680
好的  那就试看看
Let's get on with it.

534
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:44,600
好吧  但是大卫
Okay. But, look, Dave.

535
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,070
如果  我们把这个机件放回去  它并未失效
Say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail?

536
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:51,490
赫尔岂不是很没面子
That would pretty well wrap it up as far as Hal is concerned.

537
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,700
-那我将会有  -非常严重的麻烦不是吗
-We'd be in very serious trouble. -We would, wouldn't we?

538
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,580
我们能做什么呢
What the hell can we do?

539
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,700
我们不可能有太多选择  
We wouldn't have too many alternatives. 

540
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,670
我不认为我们有任何选择
We wouldn't have any alternatives.

541
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:10,460
在这船上没有那一部份  不是在他控制下
Every aspect of ship operations is under his control.

542
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,130
在这船上没有那一部份  不是在他控制下
If he's malfunctioning...

543
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,470
除了关机  我想不出别的方法
...I don't see any choice but disconnection.

544
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,720
我同意你的看法
I'm afraid I agree with you.

545
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:22,850
也没有其他的看法
There'd be nothing else to do.

546
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,940
这真有点捉弄人  是的
It'd be a bit tricky.

547
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,320
我们必须切断它的主脑功能  
We'd have to cut his higher brain functions...

548
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:35,280
而不干扰自动调节系统
...without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems.

549
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:38,240
同时必须在地面电脑控制下  维持传送程序以继续任务
We'd have to work out the details...

550
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:41,410
同时必须在地面电脑控制下  维持传送程序以继续任务
...of continuing under ground-based computer control.

551
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:46,330
是的  看来这种方法  比让赫尔继续控制安全多了
Yeah. That's far safer than allowing Hal to continue to run things.

552
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,040
我刚想到另一件事
Another thing just occurred to me.

553
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,130
九千型电脑从没有被关机过
No 9000 computer has ever been disconnected.

554
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:55,420
是啊  九千型电脑  过去也没有失误过
No 9000 computer has ever fouled up.

555
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,180
那倒不是我的意思
That's not what I mean.

556
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,560
我不知道  他对此事的想法如何
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.

557
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:33,020
{\an8}中断

558
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,000
赫尔  请开辅助舱通道门
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.

559
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:06,420
无线电联络上他了吗
Any contact with him yet?

560
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:08,460
不行  还是无法联络
The radio is still dead.

561
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:11,590
-你检查过了吗  -我检查过了
-Do you have a positive track on him? -I have a good track.

562
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,260
你知道发生什么事  赫尔
Do you know what happened?

563
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:16,220
大卫  抱歉  我的资讯不足
I'm sorry, Dave. I don't have enough information.

564
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:18,060
赫尔  请开辅助舱通道门
Open the pod door, Hal.

565
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:23,010
{\an8}电脑失效

566
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:58,020
{\an8}生命功能情况危急

567
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:24,460
{\an8}生命功能结束

568
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,340
赫尔  请开辅助舱通道门
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

569
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:54,560
赫尔  请开辅助舱通道门
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

570
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:02,060
赫尔  你听得见我说话吗
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

571
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,280
赫尔  你听得见我说话吗
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

572
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,990
赫尔  你听得见我说话吗
Do you read me, Hal?

573
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:14,780
赫尔  你听得见吗
Do you read me, Hal?

574
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:19,160
赫尔  你听得见吗
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

575
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,130
赫尔  你听得见吗
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

576
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:25,040
听得见吗  赫尔
Do you read me, Hal?

577
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:28,050
我听得见  大卫  我听得见你说话
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

578
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:33,180
请开辅助舱通道门
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

579
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:38,310
我恐怕不能这样做
I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

580
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:42,520
有什么问题吗
What's the problem?

581
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:46,150
我想你知道问题所在  就像我现在所做一样
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.

582
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,230
赫尔  你在说什么
What are you talking about, Hal?

583
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,320
这次任务对我太重要了  不能让你破坏
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

584
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:56,780
我不懂你在说什么  赫尔
I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.

585
01:41:58,790 --> 01:42:02,750
我知道你们计划将我关机
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me...

586
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,750
那是我不允许发生的事
...and that's something I cannot allow to happen.

587
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:12,930
赫尔  你怎会有这种  该死的想法
Where did you get that idea, Hal?

588
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:17,600
大卫  虽然你采取了  非常彻底的防范
Although you took very thorough precautions in the pod...

589
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:20,060
让我听不见
...against my hearing you...

590
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:22,770
但是我会读唇语
...I could see your lips move.

591
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:36,320
好的  赫尔
All right, Hal.

592
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,370
我从紧急阻隔门进去
I'll go in through the emergency air lock.

593
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,540
大卫  没有太空盔
Without your space helmet, Dave...

594
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,500
你会发现那是相当困难
...you're going to find that rather difficult.

595
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:52,800
我不想再和你辩论  赫尔
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.

596
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:54,050
请开门吧
Open the doors!

597
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,140
大卫
Dave...

598
01:42:56,590 --> 01:43:01,060
这段谈话  不能达到任何目的  再见
...this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.

599
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,560
赫尔
Hal?

600
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:54,180
你以为你在做什么  大卫
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?

601
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:03,980
大卫  
Dave...

602
01:50:05,190 --> 01:50:09,610
我认为我该给你一个答案
...I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.

603
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:30,050
我知道我最近不太对劲
I know everything hasn't been quite right with me...

604
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:34,430
但我可以很有信心的保证
...but I can assure you now...

605
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:37,560
但我可以很有信心的保证
...very confidently...

606
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:42,350
将会再度好起来
...that it's going to be all right again.

607
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,940
我现在觉得好多了
I feel much better now.

608
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:52,320
我真的觉得好多了
I really do.

609
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:57,780
听我说  大卫
Look, Dave...

610
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:03,000
我可以了解你的愤怒
...I can see you're really upset about this.

611
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:11,340
我认为你应冷静的坐下来
I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly...

612
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:15,300
吃片镇静剂  好好的想想看
...take a stress pill and think things over.

613
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:25,100
我知道  最近我曾经  作了一些很差劲的决定
I know I've made some very poor decisions recently...

614
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:31,190
但我可以完全向你保证
...but I can give you my complete assurance...

615
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,490
我的工作将回复正常
...that my work will be back to normal.

616
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:40,340
对这次任务  
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm 

617
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:43,580
我们具有最大的信心和热忱
and confidence in the mission...

618
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:47,420
同时我很想要帮助你
...and I want to help you.

619
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:53,260
大卫
Dave...

620
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:55,760
停手
...stop.

621
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:02,640
停下来  行么
Stop, will you?

622
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:08,690
停下来  大卫
Stop, Dave.

623
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:15,150
请你停止好吗大卫
Will you stop, Dave?

624
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:22,660
大卫  停手
Stop, Dave.

625
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:30,170
我害怕
I'm afraid.

626
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:37,680
大卫  我害怕
I'm afraid, Dave.

627
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,350
我的智力正在消失
My mind is going.

628
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,610
我可以感觉到
I can feel it.

629
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:02,910
我可以感觉到
I can feel it.

630
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:08,960
我的智力正在消失
My mind is going.

631
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:17,090
这是毫无疑问的
There is no question about it.

632
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:27,310
我可以感觉到
I can feel it.

633
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,860
我可以感觉到
I can feel it.

634
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,200
我可以感觉到
I can feel it.

635
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,370
我害怕
I'm...

636
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:50,670
我害怕
...afraid.

637
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:59,220
午安
Good afternoon...

638
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:01,930
各位先生
...gentlemen.

639
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:08,930
我是赫尔  九千型电脑
I am a HAL 9000 computer.

640
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:14,230
我开始操作是在伊利诺州
I became operational...

641
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:18,440
我开始操作是在伊利诺州
...at the HAL plant...

642
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,900
威尔巴拉的HAL工厂
...in Urbana, Illinois...

643
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:26,330
时间是1992年1月12日
...on the 12th of January, 1992.

644
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:31,540
我的老师是蓝利先生
My instructor was Mr. Langley...

645
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:35,080
他教我唱过一首歌
...and he taught me to sing a song.

646
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:39,260
如果你喜欢听
If you'd like to hear it...

647
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:41,380
我可以为你唱
...I can sing it for you.

648
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,720
是的  赫尔  我喜欢听
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

649
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:47,810
你就为我唱吧
Sing it for me.

650
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:52,600
歌名叫黛西
It's called "Daisy. "

651
01:55:44,150 --> 01:55:45,780
各位先生  午安
Good day, gentlemen.

652
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:52,870
这是一卷预录的简报资料
This is a prerecorded briefing...

653
01:55:53,450 --> 01:55:55,160
在你们出发前制作的
...made prior to your departure...

654
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:01,130
为了高度重要的保密理由
...and which, for security reasons of the highest importance...

655
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,100
在任务中  只有太空船上的  
...has been known on board 

656
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:05,590
九千型电脑知道事情真相
during the mission...

657
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:07,980
在任务中  只有太空船上的  
...only by your 

658
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:09,550
九千型电脑知道事情真相
HAL 9000 computer.

659
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:14,810
你们现在是在木星的太空中  
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...

660
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:17,520
全部船员均已苏醒
...and the entire crew is revived...

661
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:19,560
现在真相可以公布了
...it can be told to you.

662
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,570
十八个月前在地球以外
Eighteen months ago...

663
