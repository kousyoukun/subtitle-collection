-是吗  -是的
- Really? - Yes, yes.

130
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,900
比如  给基地打电话时
Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base,

131
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,400
你只能听到一段录音
all you can get is a recording...

132
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,550
不断重复说着  电话线路暂时出现了故障
which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.

133
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,030
大概是设备出了故障
Probably having some trouble with their equipment.

134
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,980
或者类似的情况
Or something like that.

135
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,110
是的
Yes.

136
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,600
是的  我们一开始也是这么认为的
Yes, that's what we thought was the explanation at first...

137
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,980
但这种情况已经持续了十天
but it's been going on now for the past 10 days.

138
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,360
过去十天里你们都联系不上任何人吗
I mean, you haven't been able to contact anyone for the past 10 days?

139
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,760
是的
That's right.

140
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,410
我明白了
Oh, I see.

141
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,030
还有件事  海伍德
There's another thing, Heywood.

142
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,760
两天前  我们有一艘火箭巴士
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...

143
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,830
想在克拉维斯环形山紧急降落  结果被拒绝了
was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius.

144
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,600
这听起来确实很奇怪
Well, that does sound odd.

145
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,130
是啊  恐怕这会引发一些争端
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about it.

146
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,700
拒绝人类降落
Denying the men permission to land

147
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,160
直接违反了国际宇航公约
is a direct violation of the IAS Convention.

148
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,930
是啊  当然  当然
Yes. Of course. Of course.

149
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,240
宇航员们安全返回了吗
Did the crew get back all right?

150
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,750
是的  他们很幸运
Yes. Fortunately, they did.

151
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,110
那就好
Well, I'm glad about that.

152
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,330
弗洛伊德博士  虽然你可能
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you

153
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,570
不太愿意谈论这方面的事
on a point you seem reticent to discuss...

154
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,270
但我能问个直接的问题吗
may I ask you a straightforward question?

155
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,360
当然可以
Well, certainly.

156
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,030
老实说  我们收到可靠的消息称
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports...

157
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,440
克拉维斯环形山爆发了严重的传染病
that quite a serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius.

158
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,780
某种未知来源的传染病
Something, apparently, of an unknown origin.

159
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,690
请问这是事实吗
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

160
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,700
抱歉  斯梅斯洛夫博士  但是
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

161
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,390
我无权谈论这件事
I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

162
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,530
我可以理解
I understand.

163
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,470
但这种传染病肯定很容易扩散到我们的基地
But this epidemic could quite easily spread to our base.

164
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,810
我们理应知晓所有事实  弗洛伊德博士
We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

165
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,360
是  我知道
Yes, I know.

166
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,480
我说了  我无权谈论这件事
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

167
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,480
你确定不一起喝一杯吗
Now, are you sure you won't change your mind about that drink?

168
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,030
我确定  我真得走了
No, I'm positive. I really must be going.

169
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,310
希望你和你妻子
Well, I hope that you and your wife

170
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,350
能去参加六月份的国际宇航大会
can come to the IAC Conference in June.

171
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,840
我们尽量  希望能去
Well, we gotta try. I hope we can make it.

172
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,720
要是来的话
If you do,

173
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,370
记得带上你那可爱的女儿一起
you do remember to bring that darling little daughter with you.

174
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,200
那要看她学校放不放假之类的了
That'll all depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing.

175
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,530
但如果能去  肯定去
But if we can, we will.

176
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,000
别忘了
Don't forget

177
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,880
如果你们去美国的话  我们热情欢迎你们的造访
you've got a standing invitation if you ever get to the states.

178
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,810
当然不会忘  格雷戈和我非常期望见到你们
No, of course not. Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.

179
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,480
那再见了  埃琳娜
Well, goodbye, Elena.

180
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,480
很高兴见到你们大家
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.

181
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,870
斯梅斯洛夫博士
Dr. Smyslov.

182
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,580
不管你去克拉维斯环形山的目的是什么  弗洛伊德博士
Whatever the reasons for your visit to Clavius, Dr. Floyd,

183
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,090
祝你好运
the very best of luck to you.

184
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,220
谢谢
Thank you.

185
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,530
女士们
Ladies.

186
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,330
他们现在肯定很艰难
Наверное, им очень трудно

187
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,590
显然啊
По видимости

188
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,810
是啊  非常艰难
Да, очень трудно

不好意思  哈沃森博士  我拍完了
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen. I'm through now.

192
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,490
-非常感谢  先生们  -不客气
- Thank you very much, gentlemen. - You're welcome.

193
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,310
那么
Well...

194
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,030
我知道大家都想和我一起
I know you will all want to join with me...

195
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,060
欢迎我们杰出的朋友和同事
in welcoming our distinguished friend and colleague...

196
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,260
来自国家航天委员会的海伍德·弗洛伊德博士
from the National Council of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

197
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:06,940
弗洛伊德博士今天特地来到克拉维斯环形山
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Clavius to be with us today.

198
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,040
在简报会开始之前
And before the briefing,

199
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,290
我知道他想跟大家说几句
I know he'd like to have a few words with you.

200
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,500
弗洛伊德博士
Dr. Floyd?

201
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,950
谢谢  哈沃森博士
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

202
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,500
大家好  很高兴再次见到各位
Hi, everybody. Nice to be back with you.

203
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,420
首先  霍威尔博士要我转达
First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell...

204
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,630
他对你们深深的谢意
who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you

205
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,010
因为你们做出了诸多牺牲
for the many sacrifices you've had to make.

206
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,620
当然  也要祝贺你们的发现
And, of course, his congratulations on your discovery...

207
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,390
那应该是科学史上
which may well prove to be among

208
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,560
最重要的发现
the most significant in the history of science.

209
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,380
那么
Now...

210
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,260
我知道这段时间以来
I know there have been

211
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,040
出现了相冲突的两种观点
some conflicting views held by some of you...

212
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,240
就是否该采取完备的安全措施一事争执不休
regarding the need for complete security in this matter.

213
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,450
更确切地说  是你们反对目前的掩饰性说法
More specifically, your opposition to the cover story...

214
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,810
让外界以为基地爆发了传染病
created to give the impression there's an epidemic at the base.

215
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,520
我知道  除了坚持原则之外
I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle...

216
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,570
你们还非常担心
many of you are troubled by

217
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,810
这种传染病的说法
the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic

218
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,740
可能会让地球上的亲朋好友担惊受怕
might cause to your relatives and friends on Earth.

219
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,130
我完全能理解你们的反对观点
Well, I completely sympathize with your negative views.

220
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,740
我自己也觉得这个掩饰性说法很尴尬
I find this cover story personally embarrassing, myself.

221
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,290
不过  我可以接受对这事绝对保密的必要性
However, I accept the need for absolute secrecy in this.

222
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,430
希望你们也能接受
And I hope you will too.

223
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,750
我相信各位肯定清楚
I'm sure you're all aware of the extremely grave potential...

224
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,620
如果未经充分准备
for cultural shock and social disorientation...

225
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,620
不等适当的时机就贸然公布情况
contained in this present situation...

226
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,720
那么此事极有可能
if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public

227
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,350
引发强烈的文化冲击和社会动乱
without adequate preparation and conditioning.

228
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,120
总之  这是委员会的看法
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

229
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,340
我此行的目的
The purpose of my visit here

230
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,810
是进一步收集情况和相关观点
is to gather additional facts and opinions on the situation...

231
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,290
准备一份报告交给委员会
and to prepare a report to the Council...

232
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,670
以供他们参考  何时  以何种方式
...recommending when and how

233
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,960
公布这一消息
the news should eventually be announced.

234
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,200
如果各位想告诉我你们的看法
If any of you would like to give me your views and opinions...

235
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,020
也可以私下跟我说
in private, if you like,

236
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,820
我非常乐意把你的看法写进报告
I'll be only too happy to include them in my report.

237
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,900
差不多就这样吧
Well, I think that's about it.

238
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,240
有什么问题吗
Any questions?

239
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,600
弗洛伊德博士  你知道
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea how much longer...

240
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,540
这个掩饰性说法还要维持多久吗
this cover story will have to be maintained?

241
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,130
我不知道  比尔
I don't know, Bill.

242
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,550
我觉得只要委员会断定
I suppose it'll be maintained

243
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,700
有继续使用的必要  就会一直用下去
as long as deemed necessary by the Council.

244
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,710
当然了  必须有足够的时间
And, of course, there must be adequate time

245
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,410
进行充分的研究
for a full study to be made in situation

246
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,270
才能考虑对外公开
before any thought can be given to making a public announcement.

247
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,460
对了  有些人可能已经知道
Oh yes, as some of you already know,

248
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,060
委员会要求
the Council has requested that

249
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,200
这件事的所有知情者
formal security oaths be obtained in writing...

250
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,450
都要手写一份正式的保密承诺
from everyone who has knowledge of this event.

251
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,730
还有其他问题吗
Were there any more questions?

252
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,040
我相信大家肯定都想
I'm sure we'll all want to

253
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,780
全力配合弗洛伊德博士
cooperate with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

254
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,040
既然没有其他问题了
and as there seems to be no more questions,

255
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,910
我们应该开始做简报了
I think we ought to get on with the briefing.

256
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,770
-谢谢  弗洛伊德博士  -谢谢
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd. - Thank you.

257
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,160
有谁饿了吗
Anybody hungry?

258
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,330
-太好了  -瞧瞧
- Great. - Well.

259
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,600
-都有什么  -应有尽有
- What do we got? - You name it.

260
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,580
-是鸡肉的吗  -算是吧
- Is this chicken? - Something like that.

261
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,940
反正都一个味道
Tastes the same, anyway.

262
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,370
有火腿的吗
Got any ham?

263
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,280
火腿  火腿  火腿
Ham, ham, ham...

264
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,400
找到了
There, that's it.

265
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,420
看着还挺不错的嘛
Look pretty good.

266
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,430
食品做得越来越好了
They're getting better at it all the time.

267
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,330
你刚刚那番讲话很精彩  海伍德
You know, that was an excellent speech you gave us, Heywood.

268
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,610
是啊
It certainly was.

269
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,640
肯定大大提升了士气
I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.

270
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,670
谢了  拉尔夫
Thanks, Ralph.

271
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,970
顺便说一句  我觉得你们两个都做得很棒
By the way, I want to say that both of you've done a wonderful job.

272
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,430
我很欣赏你们处理这件事的方法
I appreciate the way you've handled this thing.

273
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,290
在我们看来
Well, the way we look at it

274
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,530
按你的意思行事  是我们的职责
it's our job to do this thing the way you want it done.

275
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,570
我们能效劳就很开心了
We're only too happy to be able to oblige.

276
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,490
你看过这些照片吗
Have you seen these yet?

277
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,870
是什么  能给我看看吗
What are they? Can I have a look at them?

278
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,470
是这一切的源头
Here's what started the whole thing.

279
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,710
好吧
Oh, yeah.

280
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,290
最开始发现时
When we first found it,

281
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,060
我们以为这可能就是一块露出地面的磁铁石
we thought it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock,

282
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,830
但所有的地质证据都与这一推测相悖
but all the geological evidence was against it.

283
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,960
即便是一大块镍铁陨石
And not even a big nickel-iron meteorite

284
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,360
也无法产生如此强烈的磁场
could produce a field as intense as this.

285
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,320
所以我们决定去实地勘察
So we decided to have a look.

286
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,750
我们猜想这可能是某种埋入式结构的上层部分
We thought it might be the upper part of some buried structure

287
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,540
于是进行了全面挖掘
so we excavated out on all sides,

288
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,870
但可惜的是  没有其他发现
but unfortunately, we didn't find anything else.

289
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,430
此外  几乎可以确定
And what's more, the evidence seems pretty conclusive

290
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,080
它的表面并没有自然侵蚀或外力作用的痕迹
that it hasn't been covered up by natural erosion or other forces.

291
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,100
它似乎是被故意掩埋的
It seems to have been deliberately buried.

292
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,110
故意掩埋
Deliberately buried.

293
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,140
喝点咖啡怎么样
Well, how about a little coffee?

294
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,320
-太好了  -好主意
- Great. - Good idea.

295
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,270
我猜你们应该完全不知道这是什么玩意儿吧
I don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is, huh?

296
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,340
我们倒是想知道啊
I wish to hell we did.

297
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,800
确实不知道  我们只能确定
No, the only thing we're sure of is that

298
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,040
它是在400万年前被掩埋的
it was buried 4 million years ago.

299
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,200
那我必须说
Well, I must say,

300
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,950
你们还是有所发现的
you guys have certainly come up with something.

301
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,030
当心  很烫
Watch this, now. It's hot.

三周前  美国航天器"发现一号"
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft Discovery One

308
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,940
开启了前往木星的5亿英里航程
left on its half-billion-mile voyage to Jupiter.

309
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,940
这也是载人航天器首次尝试登陆这一遥远星球
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.

310
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,480
今天下午早些时候
Earlier this afternoon,

311
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,150
《今日世界》录制了与发现号航天员的采访视频
The World Tonight recorded an interview with the crew of Discovery

312
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,840
他们距离地球8000万英里
at a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.

313
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,160
我们说的话需经过七分钟
It took seven minutes for our words

314
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,190
才能传至这一巨型航天器
to reach the giant spacecraft

315
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,800
但这种时间延迟已在视频中经过剪辑处理
but this time delay has been edited from this recording.

316
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,400
我台记者马丁·艾莫采访了航天员
Our reporter Martin Amer speaks to the crew.

317
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,490
发现一号的航天员为五名男性
The crew of Discovery One consists of five men

318
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:32,200
以及最新一代的HAL 9000计算机
and one of the latest generation of the HAL 9000 computers.

319
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,140
五人中有三人以睡眠状态登舱
Three of the five men were put aboard asleep

320
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,230
更准确地说  是以休眠状态
or, to be more precise, in a state of hibernation.

321
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:41,660
分别为查尔斯·亨特博士  杰克·凯博尔博士
They were Dr. Charles Hunter, Dr. Jack Kimball

322
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,640
以及维克多·卡明斯基博士
and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.

323
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,940
我们采访到了任务指令长大卫·鲍曼博士
We spoke with mission commander Dr. David Bowman

324
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,450
和他的副手弗兰克·普尔博士
and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

325
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,300
下午好  先生们  一切都好吗
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen. How is everything going?

326
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,600
好极了
Marvelous.

327
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,840
没什么...
Have no...

328
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,950
我们没什么可抱怨的
We have no complaints.

329
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,040
听你们这么说可真是太好了
Well, I'm very glad to hear that.

330
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,750
我也相信全世界都会和我一起
And I'm sure that the entire world would join me

331
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,410
祝愿你们此次远航能够安全和成功
in wishing you a safe and successful voyage.

332
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,240
-非常感谢  -谢谢你
- Thanks very much. - Thank you.

333
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:10,670
尽管在此前的太空探索活动中已经使用过休眠方式
Although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts,

334
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:11,800
但这是首次
this is the first time that

335
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,170
宇航员在出发前就进入了休眠状态
men have been put into hibernation before departure.

336
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,700
为何这样安排
Why was this done?

337
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,510
这样安排是为了最大限度地储存
Well, this was done in order to achieve the maximum conservation

338
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,990
我们的生命维持资源  主要是食物和空气
of our life-support capabilities, basically food and air.

339
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,010
正在休眠的三名航天员属于调查小组
Now the three hibernating crew members represent the survey team.

341

我们临近木星时
And their efforts won't be utilized

342
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,780
他们才会派上用场
until we're approaching Jupiter.

343
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,820
普尔博士  处于休眠状态是怎么感觉
Dr. Poole, what's it like while you're in hibernation?

344
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,690
就跟睡觉一样
It's exactly like being asleep.

345
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,760
完全不会感觉到时间的流逝
You have absolutely no sense of time.

346
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,070
唯一的区别是不会做梦
The only difference is that you don't dream.

347
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,210
据我了解  那种状态下每分钟只会呼吸一次
As I understand it, you only breathe once a minute.

348
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,510
这是真的吗
Is this true?

349
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,460
没错  而且每分钟的心跳只有三次
Well, that's right, and the heart beats three times a minute.

350

353
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,460
休眠的问题
about the problems of hibernation,

369
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,930

370
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,180

而懊恼过吗

完全没有

跟你之前对他的描述差不多
Well, it's pretty close to what you said about him earlier.

391
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,010
他就像是第六名航天员
He's just like a sixth member of the crew...

392
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,680
我很快就习惯了他会说话的事实
very quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks,

393
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,100
会把他当作一个人来看待
and you think of him really just as another person.

394
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,920
在与计算机交流的过程中
In talking to the computer,

395
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,890
有人感觉到他能做出情绪反应
one gets the sense that he's capable of emotional responses.

396
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,340
比如  当我问到他的能力时
For example, when I asked him about his abilities,

397
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,190
他回答说自己是精准完美的
I sensed a certain pride in his answer

398
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,630
我从中感到了一丝得意
about his accuracy and perfection.

399
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,920
你认为哈尔具有真情实感吗
Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?

400
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,150
他表现得像是有真情实感
Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.

401
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,120
当然了  他的程序是这么设定的
Of course, he's programmed that way

402
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,290
好让我们能更加方便地与他交流
to make it easier for us to talk to him.

403
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,220
但是至于他有没有感情
But as to whether or not he has real feelings

404
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,030
我觉得没有人能给出确切的答案
is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.

405
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,890
打扰一下  弗兰克
Excuse me, Frank.

406
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,680
怎么了  哈尔
What is it, Hal?

407
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,450
我们收到了你父母传来的消息
We've got the transmission from your parents coming in.

408
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,320
好
Fine.

409
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,140
就在这播放吧  把我移过去一点
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

410
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,570
好的
Certainly.

411
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,410
-你好  弗兰克  -生日快乐  亲爱的
- Hello, Frank. - Happy birthday, darling.

412
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,790
生日快乐  年年有今日  岁岁有今朝
Happy birthday. Many happy returns of the day..

413
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:29,490
-再升高一点  哈尔  -很高兴听到你和大卫都很好
- A bit higher, Hal. - Glad to hear you and Dave are well.

414
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,810
你妈妈和我也都很好
Mother and I are both feeling wonderful too.

415
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,530
雷和莎莉本来也准备来跟你通话的
Ray and Sally were going to be here too

416
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:36,570
但雷的背伤突然又犯了
but at the last minute Ray's back went bad on him again.

417
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,940
-你喜欢这个蛋糕吗  -看起来很棒吧
- How do you like your cake, dear? - Looks great, huh?

418
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,520
可惜你不能和我们一起共享
Sorry you can't join us.

419
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,480
前几天我遇到了鲍勃
I ran into Bob the other day.

420
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,580
他说一定要让我代为祝你生日快乐
He said be sure to wish you happy birthday.

421
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,460
我的全体学生也让我务必向你问好
All my students made me promise to send their best wishes too.

422
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,640
他们在教室里总是谈到你  弗兰克
You know they talk about you all the time in the classroom, Frank.

423
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,080
你成了二年级学生心中的大名人了
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.

424
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,410
上周我们上了电视
You know we were on television last week.

425
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,840
没错  你妈妈和我还有大卫的父母
Oh yes, yes. Your mother and I and Dave's parents

426
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,830
被问到我们如何看待自己的杰出的儿子
were interviewed about what we thought of our illustrious sons.

427
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,520
你可以想象得出我们是怎么回答的
Heh, you can imagine what we told them.

428
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,480
好像节目下周四就会播出
I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.

429
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,250
或许你能收听到
Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.

430
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,270
对了  埃琳娜和比尔的事  我们也很激动
Oh, we were thrilled about Elaine and Bill, dear.

431
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,840
我很乐意帮你给他们买礼物
I'll be glad to get the present for you

432
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,830
不过请告诉我预算是多少
but please tell me how much I can spend.

433
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,390
对了  弗兰克  你的AGS19薪水
Oh, yes, Frank, about your AGS-19 payments...

434
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,160
我应该都帮你处理好了
I think I straightened it out for you.

435
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,330
我昨天跟休斯顿那边的财务室谈过了
I talked to the accounting office in Houston yesterday

436
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,890
他们说下个月你应该就能收到
and they said you should be receiving

437
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:22,150
涨过之后的工资了
your higher rates of pay by next month.

438
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,810
好了  弗兰克  我没什么要说的了
Well, Frank, I can't think of anything else to say, now.

439
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,710
代我们向大卫问好
Give our love to Dave.

440
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:29,100
没错  记得问好
Oh yes. Be sure to give him our best regards.

441
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,470
我们衷心地祝你生日快乐
We wish you the very happiest of birthdays.

442
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,540
上帝保佑
God bless!

443
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,230
一切顺利  儿子
All the best, son.

444
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,800
{\an9\fs14\i1}♪祝你生日快乐♪
{\rEng\fs10\i1}♪Happy birthday to you♪

445
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,060
{\an9\fs14\i1}♪祝你生日快乐♪
{\rEng\fs10\i1}♪Happy birthday to you♪

446
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,980
{\an9\fs14\i1}♪祝你生日快乐  亲爱的弗兰克♪
{\rEng\fs10\i1}♪Happy birthday, dear Frank♪

447
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,190
{\an9\fs14\i1}♪祝你生日快乐♪
{\rEng\fs10\i1}♪Happy birthday to you.♪

448
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,140
下周三见
See you next Wednesday.

449
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,130
祝你生日快乐  弗兰克
Happy birthday, Frank.

450
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:58,460
谢谢你  哈尔  请放平一点
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

451
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,810
总之  后吃兵
Anyway, queen takes pawn.

452
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,780
象吃兵
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

453
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:26,230
这步棋下得漂亮
Lovely move.

454
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,110
车走一步到王
Rook to king one.

455
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,900
不好意思  弗兰克  我觉得你输了
I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.

456
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:39,180
后进三到象  象吃后
Queen to bishop three. Bishop takes queen.

457
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,730
马吃象  朋友
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

458
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,330
没错  你说得很对  我投降
Er, yeah. Looks like you're right. I resign.

459
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,790
谢谢你  这盘棋下得很愉快
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

460
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,100
是啊  谢谢你
Yeah. Thank you.

461
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,970
-晚上好  大卫  -你还好吗  哈尔
- Good evening, Dave. - How are you, Hal?

462
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:36,510
-一切顺利  你呢  -还不错
- Everything's running smoothly. And you? - Not too bad.

463
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,250
你又忙了一些工作上的事吗
Have you been doing more work?

464
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,520
画了几幅草图
A few sketches.

465
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,810
-可以给我看看吗  -当然
- May I see them? - Sure.

466
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,320
画得真不错  大卫
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

467
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:51,650
我觉得你进步很大
I think you've improved a great deal.

468
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,690
-你能拿近点吗  -好
- Can you hold it a bit closer? - Sure.

469
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,080
那不是亨特博士吗
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

470
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,850
顺便问下
By the way...

471
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:08,570
你介意我问你个私人问题吗
do you mind if I ask you a personal question?

472
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:10,820
不  不介意
No, not at all.

473
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:14,300
请原谅我这么喜欢打听
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...

474
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,860
但过去几周我一直都在想
but during the past few weeks I've wondered...

475
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,590
你对此次任务是否有了些疑虑
whether you might be having second thoughts about the mission.

476
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,480
什么意思
How do you mean?

477
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:27,680
真要说起来  很难定义
Well, it's rather difficult to define.

478
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,300
或许我只是在表达我对这件事的担忧
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.

479
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:37,820
我知道我从未打消过这样的疑虑
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion...

480
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:42,030
这次任务存在一些非常奇怪的情况
that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.

481
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,530
我相信你也同意我的话有一定的道理
I'm sure you'll agree there's some truth in what I say.

482
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,080
我也说不清  这是个很难回答的问题
Well, I don't know. That's rather a difficult question to answer.

483
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,080
你不介意谈谈这事吧  大卫
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?

484
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:56,870
不  不介意
No, not at all.

485
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,590
显然没人会不知晓
Certainly no one could have been unaware of

486
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:04,260
我们出发前身边流传的离奇故事
the very strange stories floating around before we left.

487
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,830
有传言说月球上挖出了一个东西
Rumors about something being dug up on the moon.

488
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:13,240
我从没相信过这些传言
I never gave these stories much credence...

489
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,640
但就某些已经发生的事来看
but particularly in view of some other things that have happened

490
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:20,890
我很难不去想
I find them difficult to put out of my mind.

491
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,120
比如
For instance...

492
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:27,420
我们的准备工作是严格保密的
the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security.

493
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,830
且戏剧性地
And the melodramatic touch of

494
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:33,210
让亨特博士  凯博尔博士  卡明斯基博士
putting Dr. Hunter, Kimball, and Kaminsky aboard

495
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,460
以休眠状态登船
already in hibernation,

496
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:38,540
且他们各自单独训练了四个月之久
after four months of training on their own.

497
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,100
你这是要写宇航员心理状态报告吗
You working up your crew psychology report?

498
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,260
当然
Of course I am.

499
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,290
很抱歉  我知道这有点可笑
Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly.

500
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:51,140
稍等
Just a moment.

501
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,060
稍等
Just a moment.

502
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,760
我刚在AE-35部件中发现一项故障
I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.

503
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:04,160
它将在72小时内完全丧失功能
It's going to go 100-percent failure within 72 hours.

504
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,440
-现在还在操作范围内吗  -是的
- Is it still within operational limits right now? - Yes.

505
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,120
在彻底丧失功能前  它将一直保持运行
And it will stay that way until it fails.

506
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,450
可以说在彻底丧失功能前  我们还有72小时吗
Would you say we have a reliable seventy-two hours to failure?

507
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,100
是的  这个数字十分准确
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.

508
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,270
那看来我们只能把它换下来修理了
Well, then I suppose we'll have to bring it in

509
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,840
但首先我要和弗兰克商量一下
but first I'd like to go over this with Frank

510
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,900
然后联络任务控制中心
and get on to Mission Control.

511
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,970
请把资料复印一份给我
Let me have the hard copy on it, please.

512
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,830
XRD1号  这里是任务控制中心
X-ray delta one, this is Mission Control.

513
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,600
你们的2013号讯息已收到
Roger your two-zero-one-three.

514
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,440
抱歉你们遇到了一点麻烦
Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble.

515
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:01,700
我们正在任务模拟器上查看遥测信息
We're reviewing telemetric information in our mission simulator

516
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,580
稍后会给出建议
and will advise.

517
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,880
已经收到你们要去舱外
Roger your plan to go EVA

518
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,940
在AE-35部件丧失功能前对其进行更换的计划
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit prior to failure.

519
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:40,260
准备好B飞行舱去舱外  哈尔
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.

520
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,450
打开舱门  哈尔
Open the pod doors, Hal.

521
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:58,030
哈尔  见鬼了  我没发现任何异常
Well, Hal. I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it.

522
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:00,330
是的
Yes.

523
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,620
真令人费解
It's puzzling.

524
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:08,390
我之前从没见过这种情况
I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this before.

525
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:14,150
我建议
I would recommend

526
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,290
将部件放回去继续使用  直至其丧失功能
that we put the unit back in operation and let it fail.

527
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:22,920
到时候追查原因就简单了
It should then be a simple matter to track down the cause.

528
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:27,680
我们可以接受  在进行替换时
We can certainly afford to be out of communication...

529
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:30,770
通讯会有短时间的断开
for the short time it will take to replace it.

Roger your one-niner-three-zero.

532
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:48,290
我们同意你们更换一号部件
We concur with your plan to replace number-one unit...

533
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:50,060
以检查故障预报
to check fault prediction.

534
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,440
必须告诉你们  我们的初步调查结果表明
We should advise you that our preliminary findings indicate

535
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,140
飞船上的9000号计算机
that your onboard 9000 computer

536
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,420
故障预测出错
is in error predicting the fault.

537
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,330
重复一遍  故障预测出错
I say again, in error predicting the fault.

538
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,370
我明白这听起来不大可能
I know this sounds rather incredible,

539
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:06,360
但此结论基于
but this conclusion is based on...

540
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,690
双子9000计算机的计算结果
the results from our twin 9000 computer.

541
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,370
我们自身也尚存疑虑
We're skeptical ourselves,

542
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,670
我们正在运行交叉检验程序
and we're running cross-checking routines

543
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:16,180
以判断此结论的可靠性
to determine reliability of this conclusion.

544
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:18,520
很抱歉出现了这种小故障  各位
Sorry about this little snag, fellows.

545
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,350
调查完毕后  我们会立即通知你们
We'll get this info to you as soon as we work it out.

我希望你们不要担心这事
I hope the two of you are not concerned about this.

549
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,690
我不担心  哈尔
No, I'm not, Hal.

550
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:38,390
你确定吗
Are you quite sure?

551
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,860
-确定  不过我想问你一个问题  -请问
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question though. - Of course.

552
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:45,310
你如何解释你和双子9000间
How do you account for the discrepancy

553
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:47,280
计算结果的差异
between you and the twin 9000?

554
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,410
我认为不存在问题
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.

555
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:54,590
差异只可能由人为错误造成
It can only be attributable to human error.

556
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,270
类似问题此前也曾出现过
This sort of thing has cropped up before...

557
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:02,080
一直都是因为人为错误
and it has always been due to human error.

558
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,300
听着  哈尔
Listen, Hal...

559
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,240
在9000系列计算机中
there's never been any instance at all of a...

560
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,610
是否从未出现过计算失误的前例
computer error occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

561
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,500
从未出现过  弗兰克
None whatsoever, Frank.

562
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,300
9000系列的运行记录完美无瑕
The 9000 Series has a perfect operational record.

563
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:22,880
我当然知道9000系列计算机的辉煌成就
Well, of course I know the wonderful achievements of the 9000 Series,

564
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,000
但是...
but...

565
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:27,400
你确定计算机从未出过错吗
Are you certain there's never been any case of even the most

566
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:30,100
哪怕是毫不起眼的小错误
insignificant computer error?

567
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,280
从未出现过  弗兰克
None whatsoever, Frank.

568
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,880
说真的  你们不必对此担心
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.

569
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,620
我相信你说得对  哈尔
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

570
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,810
好的  非常感谢
Fine. Thanks very much.

571
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,870
弗兰克  我C号飞行舱的通讯器出了点问题
Oh, Frank, I'm having trouble with my transmitter in C-pod.

572
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:54,620
你能和我过去看一眼吗
Would you come down and take a look at it with me?

573
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:56,920
-好  -待会儿见  哈尔
- Sure. - See you later, Hal.

574
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:20,420
请旋转C舱  哈尔
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.

575
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:31,020
出了什么问题  大卫
What sort of trouble have you been having Dave?

576
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:33,700
我的D频总有干扰
I've been getting some interference in D-channel.

577
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:35,680
我们来看看吧
We'll have a look at it.

578
01:23:41,970 --> 01:23:43,530
打开舱门  哈尔
Open the door, Hal.

请旋转舱体  哈尔
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

他应该听不见我们说话了
I don't think he can hear us.

585
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,210
请旋转舱体  哈尔
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

586
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:44,790
好了  这样应该没问题了
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.

587
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,490
你是什么想法
What do you think?

588
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:51,700
我不确定  你呢
I'm not sure. What do you think?

589
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,720
我对他有种不好的预感
I've got a bad feeling about him.

590
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,190
-是吗  -是的  我确定
- You do? - Yeah. Definitely.

591
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,790
你不觉得吗
Don't you?

592
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,400
我也说不清  好像是
I don't know. I think so.

593
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,630
当然  他确实说得没错
You know, of course though he's right about

594
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,750
9000系列计算机有着完美的运行记录
the 9000 series having a perfect operational record.

595
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:06,900
确实如此
They do.

596
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,140
不幸的是  那听起来有点像出名的临终遗言
Unfortunately, that sounds a little like famous last words.

597
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,070
是啊  不过进行故障模式分析
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out

598
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:15,070
是他的主意  不是吗
the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

599
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,420
这一点的确能彰显他的诚实与自信
It should certainly indicate his integrity and self-confidence.

600
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,160
如果他错了  这样就能确定无疑地证明
If he were wrong, it'd be the surest way of proving it.

601
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:24,330
前提是他知道自己错了
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

602
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,350
大卫  我无法完全确定
Look Dave, I can't put my finger on it,

603
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:30,800
但我总觉得他有些古怪
but I sense something strange about him.

604
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,690
但我还是想不出一个合理的理由
Still I can't think of a good reason

605
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:35,830
不将一号部件放回去
not to put back the number one unit

606
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,450
并继续执行故障模式分析
and carry on with the failure mode analysis.

607
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,670
是啊  这点我同意
No, no, I agree about that.

608
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,420
那就这么办吧
Well let's get on with it.

609
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,740
好的  但是  大卫
Okay. But, look, Dave.

610
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,440
如果我们把部件装回去  但它并没有丧失功能
Let's say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail.

611
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:49,490
那在哈尔看来  就没有任何问题
That would pretty well wrap it up

612
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:51,420
不会查下去了  对吧
as far as Hal is concerned, wouldn't it?

613
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:55,080
到时我们的麻烦可就大了
Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.

614
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,600
是啊  可不是嘛
We would, wouldn't we?

615
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,890
那我们能怎么办
What the hell can we do?

616
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:03,610
我们的选择很有限
Well, we wouldn't have too many alternatives.

617
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,580
在我看来  我们根本别无选择
I don't think we'd have any alternatives.

618
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:08,720
这艘飞船的方方面面
There isn't a single aspect of ship operations

619
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,670
都在他的掌控之下
that's not under his control.

620
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,610
如果事实证明他出了故障...
If he were proving to be malfunctioning...

621
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:15,550
我们唯一的选择  就是断开计算机的连接
I don't see we'd have any choice but disconnection.

622
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,270
恐怕我的看法和你一致
I'm afraid I agree with you.

623
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:23,050
别无他法了
There'd be nothing else to do.

624
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,000
-这事有点棘手  -是啊
- It'd be a bit tricky. - Yeah.

625
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:30,490
我们得切断他的高级大脑功能
We'd have to cut his higher brain functions...

626
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:35,280
同时不能干扰到全自动化系统和监管系统
without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems.

627
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,690
我们还得想办法将控制权转移给
And we'd have to work out the transfer procedures

是啊
Yeah.

630
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:46,520
那也比让哈尔继续管控安全得多
Well, that's far safer than allowing Hal to continue running things.

631
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,230
我突然又想起来一件事
You know, another thing just occurred to me.

632
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:53,770
据我所知  9000计算机还从未被断开连接过
As far as I know, no 9000 computer has ever been disconnected.

633
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,910
9000计算机也从没出过问题
No 9000 computer has ever fouled up before.

634
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,570
我不是这个意思
That's not what I mean.

635
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:01,930
我不知道他会对此有什么想法
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.
