00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:42,329
Yep. Hey, did you grab your stuff

(LAUGHS) Nice!
Does that mean you're gonna

blow him underneath the bleachers?

- A couple months ago.

KEVIN: What about us?

97
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:07,388
I mean, what about our plans to
go to Fieldmont together?

98
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,661
And the campus tour this weekend?

99
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,918
Just go without me.

Look, it's senior year.

101
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:21,982
It's, like, so exciting,

102
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:26,127
And you're, like, not fun.

103

- Thrilling!
- Gina...

00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,094
When we were freshmen, it was one thing.

But this is our time to really go crazy!
We're supposed to be partying.

00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:52,045
And you, you're just... You're a loser!

Kevin, it's over.

113

and I can't let you ruin my senior year.

116
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:11,200
You didn't get blown under the bleachers?

117
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:14,688
No! Dude, have you been listening to me?
She dumped me!

118
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,704
I was dumped once.

119
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,591
Morris, you're such a fucking liar, dude.

120
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:21,375
- You've never even had a girlfriend.
- Shut up, Carter. Yes, I did.

121
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,295
Remember, Kev?
You introduced me to her.

122
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:24,511
- Right.
- MORRIS: She was real.

123
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:28,031
- We went to physics camp together.
- Maybe more like fantasy camp.

124
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,401
Come on, you guys. Do you mind?
I'm having a breakdown here.

125
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:31,776
What am I supposed to do now?

126
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:34,112
It was all set.
First, we'd go to college together,

127
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:37,312
and then we'd get married,
have a couple kids, one girl, one boy.

128
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:40,800
Dude, is that the kind of shit
you would say to Gina?

129
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:44,149
God! No wonder she dumped your ass.
You're fucking lame.

130
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,440
- What's up, fellows?
- What's up, Fletcher?

131
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,152
What's up with Negative Nancy over here?

132
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,040
Gina dumped him.
He's having a breakdown.

133
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,848
Cool. So are you guys going on some sort
of road trip to Fieldmont this weekend?

134
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,153
- I don't think I'm going anymore.
- That's too bad.

135
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:59,681
I just went there last weekend
to visit my bro.

136
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:00,801
I almost didn't make it back.

137
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:03,553
"Almost didn't make it back"?
Dude, it's just college.

138
00:08:03,554 --> 00:08:05,793
Yeah, yeah, just college.
Yeah, see, that's what I thought, too.

139
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:08,225
And then I went,
and I'm telling you guys right now,

140
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:11,923
it is fucking nuts, man. It's retarded.

141
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:14,017
Why? What happened?

142
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:16,460
You guys want to know?

143
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,913
Basically, this is how it went down.

144
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,513
I didn't sleep for three days, okay?

145
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:21,921
I don't have any money left
in my bank account.

146
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:23,138
I maxed out my parents' credit card,

147
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,186
which was only supposed
to be used in case of an emergency.

148
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:27,266
I lost my cell phone,
which is actually my dad's cell phone.

149
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,930
So he's pissed about that
and the credit card.

150
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:32,034
I tried smoking a tampon,
which I thought was a big fat joint.

151
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:34,754
Still got high. Stole a car,
got in a bar fight, ate some goldfish.

152
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:37,282
Played naked Frisbee, did some whip-its,
wet my brother's bed twice.

but please don't tell anyone,
'cause I'm kind of embarrassed about that.

155

Saw two girls make out.
With tongue! With tongue!

156
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:46,914
Watched my brother's roommates
eat as many cheeseburgers as they could

157
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:47,970
until one of them puked.

158
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:49,891
Found a tattoo on my lower back
of a unicorn.

159
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:50,979
Don't remember getting that.

160
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,931
Figure I'll just tell people
it's some sort of killer unicorn.

161
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,180
You know? So it doesn't seem so gay.

162
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:57,136
I laughed. I cried. Fell in love.

163
00:08:57,348 --> 00:09:00,611
Yeah, and did I mention earlier
that I got laid?

164
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:03,427
Three times. Different girls, yeah.

165
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:07,459
So all in all, I'd say it was pretty much
the best weekend of my fucking life.

168

What if I could have a weekend like that,
a weekend like Fletcher's?

169
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:20,068
How? No way.
Who knows if he's even telling the truth?

170
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,148
Come on, man. What if he was?
You heard him.

171
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:27,319
All the craziness, the partying, the sex,
the drinking, it sounds incredible.

You know, maybe I'll even get a tattoo.

to get back at Gina is a really bad idea.

Mr. Hooper, there is no doubt
that you are academically gifted,

818
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:11,263
but the scholarships we give out here
are about much more than just that.

and I'd like to continue that legacy.

Well, you know, son, I guess
you're gonna have to prove it to me.

For, as of right now, Mr. Hooper,

824
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:27,759
you and your scholarship
are hanging by a thread.

- I understand, man.
- What am I gonna do?

833

that I actually want to go here.

you can do about it tonight, all right?

No, not at all.

01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,777
Probably not, Morris.
I pretty much blew it for all of us.

1072
01:03:05,778 --> 01:03:07,793
So that was my last shot
to score with Amy.

1073
01:03:07,794 --> 01:03:09,873
All I wanna do is bang
one college chick this weekend.

1074
01:03:09,874 --> 01:03:11,953
Is that so much to ask?

1075
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,861
What the hell?

1076
01:03:16,017 --> 01:03:18,405
MORRIS: My glasses! My glasses!

1077
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:23,843
Get them in the van! Get them in.

1078
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,732
Get them in.

1079
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:38,738
- TEAGUE: You pukes are worthless.
- Worthless!

1080
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:42,482
Nothing but a bunch
of goddamn high school kids!

1081
01:03:42,483 --> 01:03:45,471
Goddamn high school kids!

1082
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:53,874
I can't believe we're even out here
wasting our time on you.

1083
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:56,659
Wasting our motherfucking time!

1084
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,378
Dude, what's with the repeating?
It's fucking killing me.

1085
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:04,069
Sorry! It's stupid. Can I get a hug?

1086
01:04:06,003 --> 01:04:09,363
Just go stand over there
and look fucking mean.

1087
01:04:09,364 --> 01:04:10,483
Do the growl thing.

1088
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:14,628
Come on, man, I'll jeeper creeper
these motherfuckers. Hug me.

1089
01:04:15,891 --> 01:04:17,569
(BARKING)

1090
01:04:24,244 --> 01:04:29,054
We got beer to drink.
So it's been fun, kind of.

1091
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:32,019
By the way,

1092
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:36,180
have you guys ever seen
a pig stampede before?

1093
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:39,028
- Fucked up. Pig stampede.
- Pig stampede!

1094
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:41,236
- ALL: Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1095
01:04:41,237 --> 01:04:43,860
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1096
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:46,965
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1097
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,092
(PIGS SQUEALING)

1098
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:59,557
BEARCAT: Get out of the front seat, bitch!
I called shotgun!

1099
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:03,892
(GUN FIRES)

1100
01:05:03,893 --> 01:05:06,084
Shit! Run!

1101
01:05:08,757 --> 01:05:10,337
(GROANING)

1102
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:17,608
Keep running, you little sicko pig fuckers!

1103
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:19,559
(GUN FIRES)

1104
01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:23,446
This sucks.

1105
01:05:23,447 --> 01:05:26,837
Yeah, thanks for
stating the obvious, Carter.

1106
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:31,943
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but I think I actually miss high school.

1107
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:35,318
- What, Kevin?
- Nothing. Forget it.

1108
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:37,174
Don't forget it. If you have
something to say, fucking say it!

1109
01:05:37,175 --> 01:05:39,606
Okay, fine, you want it? Here it is.
You're full of shit, Carter!

1110
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:40,694
I'm full of shit?

1111
01:05:40,695 --> 01:05:42,935
Yeah! You're always talking
such a big fucking game, man.

1112
01:05:42,936 --> 01:05:46,600
You know what? Newsflash!
He's never even been laid.

1113
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:53,270
- So, that's how it's gonna be, huh, Kevin?
- No, no, no. Wait. You're still a virgin?

1114
01:05:53,271 --> 01:05:57,366
- (LAUGHING) Man! This is great.
- Yeah, whatever, Morris! Shut up!

1115
01:05:57,367 --> 01:05:58,903
You know what, Kev? Stop dumping on us

1116
01:05:58,904 --> 01:06:00,919
'cause the weekend didn't turn out
the way you thought it would!

1117
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,647
Yeah, probably because
I've been listening to you too much.

1118
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:06,967
Yeah, 'cause it was my idea to try
to prove Gina wrong and lie to Kendall!

1119
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:09,751
- That was all you, man!
- Guys, come on. Let's not fight.

1120
01:06:09,752 --> 01:06:12,152
You know what? Stay out of it, Morris!
You're not part of this!

1121
01:06:12,153 --> 01:06:13,560
I'm not part of this?

1122
01:06:13,561 --> 01:06:15,543
This was supposed to be yours
and my weekend here.

1123
01:06:15,544 --> 01:06:17,079
Dude, whatever.
I didn't mean it like that.

1124
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,968
No, but while we're comparing
shitty weekends,

1125
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:20,088
here's one for you.

1126
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:22,744
My face got written on
before my scholarship interview,

1127
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,664
a pig just snacked on my nuts,

1128
01:06:24,665 --> 01:06:26,584
and, oh, yeah,
I almost forgot about this one,

1129
01:06:26,585 --> 01:06:28,152
I puked on the Dean's car,

1130
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:30,455
which pretty much means
that I'm not getting my scholarship!

1131
01:06:30,456 --> 01:06:31,800
God, Morris! Ever since you got here

1132
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:33,944
you whine, whine, whine
about your fucking scholarship.

1133
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:35,096
You don't even want to go here.

1134
01:06:35,097 --> 01:06:37,624
It's not about what I want!
You know how my parents are!

1135
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:40,025
Yeah, well, then grow some fucking balls
and stand up to them.

1136
01:06:40,026 --> 01:06:41,432
It's not that easy.

1137
01:06:41,433 --> 01:06:43,704
Hey, man, what's next?
They're gonna choose what job you take?

1138
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:46,889
- What girl you marry?
- Dude, lay off, Kev!

1139
01:06:47,193 --> 01:06:49,017
That's a first.
You're sticking up for Morris, man?

1140
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:51,897
- You bag on him more than anyone.
- That's not true and you fucking know it!

1141
01:06:51,898 --> 01:06:53,510
Ha!

1142
01:06:53,945 --> 01:06:56,313
Okay, you know what, Morris? Fuck you!

1143
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:58,808
That's the last time
I ever have your fucking back!

1144
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:03,533
You know what? Fuck you, too, Kevin,
for dumping all your bullshit on us.

1145
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:08,409
All right, fine, Morris.
Yeah, walk away with him.

1146
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,033
Why don't you hold his hand
while you're at it?

1147
01:07:11,034 --> 01:07:15,002
- Fuck you, Kevin.
- Dropping the F-bomb, big man.

1148
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:17,145
What is that,
the first time you ever used it?

1149
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:19,556
I'm telling your parents!

1150
01:07:20,282 --> 01:07:21,401
Fuck!

1151
01:07:21,402 --> 01:07:24,041

01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,013
So...

1172
01:09:44,128 --> 01:09:46,399
- Look, about what happened...
- Don't even go there.

1173
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,080
- Just let me explain.
- I really don't want to hear it, Kevin.

1174
01:09:50,081 --> 01:09:51,967
I don't even know who you are.

1175
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:54,399
Yeah, to be honest,
I'm not even sure I know anymore.

1176
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,322
Maybe it's time you figure that out.

1177
01:09:58,752 --> 01:10:03,551
You know, high school, college,
it wouldn't have mattered to me.

1178
01:10:03,552 --> 01:10:05,823
Yeah, I know. It's so stupid.

1179
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:10,220
You know, I came down here thinking
I needed to change who I was.

1180
01:10:10,817 --> 01:10:12,961
Lying to you was just part of it.

1181
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:15,552
I thought you were pretty great.
Why would you want to change that?

1182
01:10:15,553 --> 01:10:17,460
I don't know.

1183
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:20,289
You don't know?

1184
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:23,744
Like, I mean,
I kind of liked who I was, or I am.

1185
01:10:23,745 --> 01:10:27,278
You know, a little uptight at times,
responsible.

1186
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:33,730
God, I really screwed up this weekend.

1187
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:36,225
You know, now Morris and Carter
are pissed at each other.

1188
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:38,635
They're both pissed at me.

1189
01:10:40,162 --> 01:10:44,321
You just seem like the kind of person
who doesn't make mistakes.

1190
01:10:44,322 --> 01:10:45,837
Ha!

1191
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:50,678
A couple weeks ago... Brace yourself.

1192
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:54,498
I hooked up with Teague.

1193
01:10:54,499 --> 01:10:57,486
- Huge mistake.
- Yeah, he kinda told me.

1194
01:10:58,947 --> 01:11:01,717
Why not? He told the whole campus.

1195
01:11:03,683 --> 01:11:06,466
Why'd you do it?
I mean, with a guy like Teague?

1196
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:09,488
- He is so...
- For all the wrong reasons.

1197
01:11:10,659 --> 01:11:13,942
He was good-looking.
He made me feel special,

1198
01:11:15,107 --> 01:11:17,602
and since he was a really good liar,

1199
01:11:17,603 --> 01:11:23,537
he made believe that it was
more than just a one-night thing.

1200
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:28,241
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

1201
01:11:28,453 --> 01:11:32,051
It was kind of why I freaked out tonight.

1202
01:11:33,604 --> 01:11:38,947
I found out that you lied and
I assumed that you were just like Teague.

1203
01:11:38,948 --> 01:11:42,448
Oh, God, please, look,
I'm nothing like that guy.

1204
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:46,903
I'm really sorry about everything.

1205
01:11:48,548 --> 01:11:51,011
Is this the real Kevin talking?

1206
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:54,308
Or is this the new and improved
college Kevin talking?

1207
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:55,493
No, this is the real me,

1208
01:11:55,494 --> 01:11:59,441
the uptight, responsible,
un-fun high school one.

1209
01:12:01,061 --> 01:12:04,627
Good. Apology accepted then.

1210
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:11,700
All right, well,
I gotta go find Carter and Morris.

1211
01:12:12,645 --> 01:12:17,236
Before you go,
can I please give you some clothes?

1212
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:24,919
- Morris? Morris, wake up!
- Kevin?

1213
01:12:26,502 --> 01:12:29,391
- What's with the...
- Where's Carter?

1214
01:12:35,046 --> 01:12:39,856
Look, you guys. I've been thinking
all night. I just want to say I'm sorry

1215
01:12:40,263 --> 01:12:42,053
about everything.

1216
01:12:42,054 --> 01:12:45,521
- You said some harsh things, man.
- Yeah, I know.

1217
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:50,086
I've realized a lot about myself
this weekend, and you guys.

1218
01:12:50,087 --> 01:12:51,974
I didn't mean what I said.

1219
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:54,534
I've just been so hung up
on what Gina told me

at college ruin that.

- Yeah.

- No. Not yet.

- The weekend's over, Kevin.

we're not wanted here anymore.

We've got to stand up for ourselves.

to these fraternity assholes on my own.

I might as well get revenge, right?

We can't do this without you.
