1
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,152
<i>I'm just a penny on the train track</i>

2
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:41,712
<i>Waiting for my judgment day</i>

3
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:45,333
<i>Come on, baby girl,
let me see those legs</i>

4
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:48,007
<i>Before I get
flattened away</i>

5
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:50,133
<i>I wait</i>

6
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:53,593
<i>Yeah, I wait</i>

7
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,541
<i>For something good,
for something great</i>

8
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:04,788
<i>Stopping in somebody's old home town</i>

9
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:07,824
<i>Gotta get that midnight meal</i>

10
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:11,317
<i>If you can't get behind your own life</i>

11
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>Get behind the driving wheel</i>

12
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:19,087
<i>And go, just go</i>

13
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:25,492
<i>Find a place that you don't know</i>

14
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,777
<i>Ran into a friend just the other night</i>

15
00:01:30,874 --> 00:01:33,263
<i>Got a badge, he's a local cop</i>

16
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:37,168
<i>Haven't seen that boy in over seven years</i>

17
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:40,023
<i>Since out of high school I dropped</i>

18
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:45,523
<i>I see, I see</i>

19
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:51,956
<i>All the things that I should be</i>

20
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,860
<i>I wait</i>

21
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:17,369
<i>Yeah, I wait</i>

22
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:23,698
<i>For something good, for something great</i>

23
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,083
<i>Dude! You're totally missing it!</i>

24
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:31,574
<i>It's fucking crazy here, man! Dude! Kev.</i>

25
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:33,813
<i>I've got an idea.</i>
<i>I want you to drop what you are doing.</i>

26
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:38,223
<i>I want you to come down here</i>
<i>and take a picture of this for the paper!</i>

27
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,941
<i> Now that, my friend,</i>
<i>is front page material. Lateski.</i>

28
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,915
Hey, Mom!
Gina, Morris and I are gonna leave

29
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:50,741
for Fieldmont right after school today.

30
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:53,907
Honey, I completely forgot about that.
Can you do it next weekend?

31
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:57,555
Derek was gonna take me into the city
tomorrow night for dinner.

32
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,664
- God! It's already 7:00?
- We can't.

33
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:02,224
Morris has a scholarship meeting
and we're signed up for the campus tour.

34
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,501
- Carter.
- Hi. What's up Ms. B?

35
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:10,325
Dude, she totally threw off my groove!
I was almost at the top level.

36
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,115
- Hey, Carter.
- What's up, man?

37
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,159
What's up, little people?

38
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,943
Running a little bit low.

39
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,830
Kev! Can I ask you a question?

40
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:22,831
You know that book that Miss Dangle
makes everybody read about the mice?

41
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:25,971
- You mean <i>Of Mice and Men?</i>
- Bingo! That's the one, yeah.

42
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,480
So let me get this straight.

43
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:31,800
These two dudes dream of buying
a farm together to raise rabbits?

44
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:33,912
Hmm.

45
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,490
And I'm no expert,
but doesn't that seem a little...

46
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:41,423
I don't know. Kind of G-A-Y?

47
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,224
Dude, I think
you're kind of missing the point.

48
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:46,104
- We can spell, Carter.
- Yeah, dumb A-S-S.

49
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,757
Dude. Satan's children, I swear.
Spawn of Satan.

50
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:56,343
Right. Come on, guys!
Mrs. Seavers is here. Let's go!

51
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,447
Grab your backpacks.

52
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:07,769
Oh, yeah!

53
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,142
All right, see you guys!

54
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:21,305
Would you look at this guy?
Why do we have to hang out with him?

55
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,711
- Hey, Morris.
- Hey, guys.

56
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:25,297
Hey, Morris,
what's up with all the geek books?

57
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:27,190
I've got a scholarship interview
in a day, Carter.

58
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,296
And my parents are up my ass about it.

59
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,376
Morris, your parents
are always up your ass.

60
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,001
Besides, don't you want to go to some
fancy-shmancy Ivy League school?

61
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,992
Guys, come on!
Do we really have to start this early?

62
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:37,780
Well, apparently,
it's not my choice, Carter.

63
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,670
At least Kevin will be there. Right, Kev?

64
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,420
Yep. Hey, did you grab your stuff
so we can split right after school today?

65
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,245
Yeah. It's in my...

66
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:54,420
Yeah, the technique was a little off,
but the timing was better.

67
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:55,731
And by the way, she's easy,

68
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,510
but not in the, like,
I'm-gonna-fuck-Morris kind of way easy.

69
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:01,688
Come on, Kev, I've got to pee.
I need you to shake it.

70
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:02,833
Carter.

71
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,073
You sure you don't wanna
come with us this weekend, man?

72
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:11,217
What? There's no reason for him to come.

73
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,380
You know what, Morris? I think, for the
first time, you and I are on the same page.

74
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,686
I don't know.
Campus tours and scholarship interviews,

75
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,192
sounds like a real blastie-blast.

76
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,388
But I think
I'd rather sock myself in the nuts.

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,700
I mean, seriously, look at this thing.

78
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,584
Like, where are all the hotties, you know?
Show some skin.

79
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,056
- Hey.
- Hey!

80
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,903
- Hey, Gina.
- Hey, Gina.

81
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:34,230
Kevin, really, just...
Listen, don't take this the wrong way.

82
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,231
But I need to talk to
your friend outside, alone.

83
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,930
Nice!
Does that mean you're gonna

84
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,422
blow him underneath the bleachers?

85
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,689
Yeah. That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

86
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:47,346
Awesome! You kids have fun! High five!

87
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:51,633
I got my high five, dude.

88
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,079
Does he give you a high five like that?

89
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,606
See you...

90
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:56,884
Here's your brochure, though.
Have a good weekend.

91
00:05:58,457 --> 00:05:59,766
Miami?

92
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:04,147
- When did you apply there?
- A couple months ago.

93
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:05,777
What about us?

94
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:07,474
I mean, what about our plans to
go to Fieldmont together?

95
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,748
And the campus tour this weekend?

96
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,605
Just go without me.

97
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:16,404
Look, it's senior year.

98
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:22,070
It's, like, so exciting,
and I wanna party, and I wanna have fun.

99
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,814
And you're, like, not fun.

100
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:31,950
Like, so what? So I don't drink very
much, you know. We still have fun.

101
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:33,748
Like our Friday nights at mini golf.

102
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,125
Yeah, they're kind of boring.

103
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:37,778
Our camping trips, the school carnival,
studying together?

104
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:40,816
Standing around while you're
taking pictures of everything?

105
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,776
- Thrilling!
- Gina...

106
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,182
When we were freshmen, it was one thing.

107
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:48,591
But this is our time to really go crazy!
We're supposed to be partying.

108
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:51,731
And you, you're just... You're a loser!

109
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,955
Kevin, it's over.

110
00:06:56,441 --> 00:07:00,947
College is just around the corner,
and I can't let you ruin my senior year.

111
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,879
That's mine.

112
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,571
<i>Okay, so let me get this straight.</i>

113
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,277
You didn't get blown under the bleachers?

114
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:14,768
No! Dude, have you been listening to me?
She dumped me!

115
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:16,783
I was dumped once.

116
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,678
Morris, you're such a fucking liar, dude.

117
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:21,460
- You've never even had a girlfriend.
- Shut up, Carter. Yes, I did.

118
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,383
Remember, Kev?
You introduced me to her.

119
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:24,593
- Right.
- She was real.

120
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:28,112
- We went to physics camp together.
- Maybe more like fantasy camp.

121
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:30,486
Come on, you guys. Do you mind?
I'm having a breakdown here.

122
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:31,862
What am I supposed to do now?

123
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,197
It was all set.
First, we'd go to college together,

124
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:37,396
and then we'd get married,
have a couple kids, one girl, one boy.

125
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:40,880
Dude, is that the kind of shit
you would say to Gina?

126
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:43,833
God! No wonder she dumped your ass.
You're fucking lame.

127
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:47,124
- What's up, fellows?
- What's up, Fletcher?

128
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:49,234
What's up with Negative Nancy over here?

129
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:51,125
Gina dumped him.
He's having a breakdown.

130
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:54,935
Cool. So are you guys going on some sort
of road trip to Fieldmont this weekend?

131
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,237
- I don't think I'm going anymore.
- That's too bad.

132
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,759
I just went there last weekend
to visit my bro.

133
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:00,880
I almost didn't make it back.

134
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:03,636
"Almost didn't make it back"?
Dude, it's just college.

135
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:05,875
Yeah, yeah, just college.
Yeah, see, that's what I thought, too.

136
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:08,311
And then I went,
and I'm telling you guys right now,

137
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,606
it is fucking nuts, man. It's retarded.

138
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:14,103
Why? What happened?

139
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,143
You guys want to know?

140
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:18,991
Basically, this is how it went down.

141
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,591
I didn't sleep for three days, okay?

142
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:22,006
I don't have any money left
in my bank account.

143
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,218
I maxed out my parents' credit card,

144
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,263
which was only supposed
to be used in case of an emergency.

145
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:27,343
I lost my cell phone,
which is actually my dad's cell phone.

146
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,009
So he's pissed about that
and the credit card.

147
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:32,113
I tried smoking a tampon,
which I thought was a big fat joint.

148
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:34,836
Still got high. Stole a car,
got in a bar fight, ate some goldfish.

149
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:37,359
Played naked Frisbee, did some whip-its,
wet my brother's bed twice.

150
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:38,414
Shit my pants, once,

151
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:41,009
but please don't tell anyone,
'cause I'm kind of embarrassed about that.

152
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:44,692
Saw two girls make out.
With tongue! With tongue!

153
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,996
Watched my brother's roommates
eat as many cheeseburgers as they could

154
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:48,045
until one of them puked.

155
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,975
Found a tattoo on my lower back
of a unicorn.

156
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:51,055
Don't remember getting that.

157
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:53,016
Figure I'll just tell people
it's some sort of killer unicorn.

158
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,258
You know? So it doesn't seem so gay.

159
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:56,817
I laughed. I cried. Fell in love.

160
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,693
Yeah, and did I mention earlier
that I got laid?

161
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:03,510
Three times. Different girls, yeah.

162
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,537
So all in all, I'd say it was pretty much
the best weekend of my fucking life.

163
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:08,754
Yeah.

164
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,350
Dude, you should go.

165
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,756
What if I could have a weekend like that,
a weekend like Fletcher's?

166
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,118
How? No way.
Who knows if he's even telling the truth?

167
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,224
Come on, man. What if he was?
You heard him.

168
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:26,999
All the craziness, the partying, the sex,
the drinking, it sounds incredible.

169
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,063
You know, maybe I'll even get a tattoo.

170
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,820
Wait, you're joking, right?

171
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:37,554
You got me, Kev. That's a good one.
Partying, drinking, sex. Up top.

172
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:41,454
I'm not kidding, Morris.
You know, maybe Gina's right, I'm no fun.

173
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,797
A weekend like Fletcher's
is exactly what I need.

174
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:47,639
Kev, having some crazy weekend
to get back at Gina is a really bad idea.

175
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:50,584
Or a really good idea,
and I say go for it.

176
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:54,962
Bitch.

177
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:56,750
You know what? I'm gonna go for it.

178
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:58,646
In fact, I'm gonna have a better weekend
than Fletcher.

179
00:09:58,745 --> 00:09:59,857
Yes!

180
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,667
Dude, I am so going.

181
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:06,902
<i>I gotta move</i>

182
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:10,929
<i>While the streets ahead are sunny</i>

183
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:16,052
<i>Fall in love with some honey</i>
<i>Oh, mama</i>

184
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,703
<i>I gotta move</i>

185
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:26,162
<i>It's time I broke out into the open</i>

186
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:28,916
<i>You know I'll settle down again some day</i>

187
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:31,384
Dude, this is definitely better
than the brochure!

188
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,204
Yeah, man,
I've got a good feeling about this.

189
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:34,352
Good feeling? What kind of good feeling?

190
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,213
Like your-boy-Carter's-gonna-get-laid
kind of feeling?

191
00:10:36,313 --> 00:10:38,648
'Cause I have that feeling too, and I love it!

192
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:41,080
I don't know, man, just everything.
I'm ready to have fun.

193
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:43,598
Yeah, man, good!
Positive vibes. Positive vibes.

194
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:47,960
Okay, Kev, it says here that the campus
tour is at 12:30 tomorrow afternoon.

195
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:51,951
And there's a pre-frosh reception tonight
before dinner in the main...

196
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:54,359
Okay, that's enough!
That is enough. No more.

197
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:55,439
That's our schedule for the weekend!

198
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:58,861
Dude, Morris, fuck schedules, man!
We're in college now.

199
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:00,692
You know what that means?

200
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,371
No parents! No curfew! Free fucking beer!

201
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:07,222
It does not get any better than this!

202
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,870
Except for that.
Dude, slow down, slow down.

203
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,944
Hey, what's up, ladies?
You on your way to class?

204
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,351
No. We just like carrying all these books
around for fun.

205
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,224
Right!
A girl's got to read, huh? Awesome.

206
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,136
So, look, we're in town for the weekend,
and we were just kind of wondering

207
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,437
if you guys could, I mean, I don't know,
show us around?

208
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,741
New guys, huh?
What college are you visiting from?

209
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:29,176
No, no, see, we're not in college.

210
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,569
- We're actually still in high school.
- What the fuck?

211
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:33,777
- I hate you so much!
- Stop it!

212
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,342
You're crushing my testicles!

213
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,870
- What my friend meant to say was...
- Fuck off!

214
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:40,627
All righty then. I'll see you guys later.

215
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:43,860
Hey, green shirt, if I give you $5 right now,

216
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:46,579
would you fart in a can
and let me just keep it in my bedroom?

217
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,372
I'll never open it! I promise.

218
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,297
These dorms are whack.
Why do we have to stay here?

219
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:55,636
You don't have to, Carter.

220
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:58,585
This is where the admissions board
put me and Kevin.

221
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:01,551
Look, I got a cousin who's a legacy
in one of the fraternities.

222
00:12:01,657 --> 00:12:03,479
I'm sure if we go there, they'll hook us up.

223
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,327
- Yeah, my parents would love that.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:10,483
Enough, you guys! Look, I don't see
what's so bad about this, Carter.

225
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,613
- What?
- God!

226
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,478
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

227
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,664
I'm Morris.

228
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:27,571
I'm Kevin, Kevin Brewer,
prospective freshman.

229
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:30,062
We're supposed to be staying in your room
this weekend.

230
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,543
Right.

231
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,662
Look, fellows, I'm gonna need about
20, 30 minutes to finish up here, okay?

232
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,834
So just come back later.

233
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,275
Probably just working out.

234
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:47,126
Yeah, he's just working out one of these.

235
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,437
- Disgusting!
- How's that frat house sound, guys?

236
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:53,584
Pretty good? Awesome.

237
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,394
Okay, dude, do you actually know
where you're going?

238
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:04,431
Dude, relax! It's right up here, I think.

239
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:06,323
All right, dude, I'm not perfect, all right?

240
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,018
All these Greek letters
look the same to me.

241
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,647
Maybe we should go back
and try the dorm again.

242
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:12,175
You shut your mouth! Shut your mouth!

243
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,459
Or not. That's cool, too.

244
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:23,153
Holy shit. Those chicks
definitely weren't in the brochure.

245
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:24,818
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

246
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,632
- What's up, college girls?
- Ladies.

247
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:30,225
- I'm Morris.
- Hi, Morris.

248
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:34,614
- She said my name.
- Chicks are smoking hot! Yeah.

249
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:40,112
"Chicks are smoking hot"?
Come on, real smooth, Carter.

250
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,862
Yeah. Smooth.

251
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:45,455
Whatever! All you got out was your name.

252
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,055
Which she repeated back to me,
I'd like to note.

253
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,089
Shut up.

254
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,062
Jesus!

255
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,241
- Nut shot.
- Ten points!

256
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:57,589
Get some.

257
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,862
Shitty news, dudes.

258
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:04,469
Dean Chandler has denied our petition,
and we're still on probation.

259
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:05,681
Shit!

260
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,617
I guess he's taking that whole
singing thing pretty seriously.

261
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:11,477
Looking good, Goose.

262
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:14,838
Looks like we got another semester
without any pledges.

263
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,726
This fucking blows, man!

264
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:20,207
What's the point of college
if you can't have pledges?

265
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:21,425
Shit!

266
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:24,689
Fuck!

267
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:27,441
Fuck!

268
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:31,288
Son of a...

269
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:36,599
That's it.
This just might be the year to graduate.

270
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:37,744
- What?
- What?

271
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:39,604
- No.
- Yeah, I didn't think it'd come so soon.

272
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,258
You can't graduate. You're Bearcat.

273
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,248
- You're an institution.
- I know.

274
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:46,254
I'm scared to graduate.

275
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,460
It seems like torturing pledges,
that's all I'm good at.

276
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:51,732
That's not true, and you know that.

277
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:55,924
You're good at a lot of things.
Cooper, tell him what he's good at.

278
00:14:56,985 --> 00:15:00,597
Like... Like the keg toss.

279
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,673
And you take the biggest dumps
in the house. Right?

280
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:07,347
Yeah. Nobody beats you at that.
It's like a real gift.

281
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,831
It is, isn't it?
Thanks, guys. I feel a lot better.

282
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,777
- Hang in there, big guy.
- You're all right.

283
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,342
Hang in there.

284
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:22,870
We'll figure this whole pledge thing out,
I promise.

285
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:37,459
Hey, man, is this the Beta Phi house?

286
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,700
What? You can't read Greek?

287
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:41,743
My cousin is a legacy here.

288
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:44,086
- Yeah? Who's your cousin?
- Toby Scott.

289
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:45,678
You mean Queef?

290
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:48,591
- What?
- Queef.

291
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,735
- What's a queef?
- A pussy fart.

292
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:53,967
It's his pledge name.

293
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,495
- Who'd want that name?
- Yeah, he earned it.

294
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:01,205
I'd like to help you guys out, with you
being his cousin and everything, but...

295
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:03,825
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

296
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,417
Come on, man.
Look, we're in high school, you know?

297
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,422
We're just up here to party, you know?
Is that too much to ask?

298
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,791
You guys are a bunch of high school kids?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,993
No, okay? Go try the dorms.

300
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,814
- A legacy, dude?
- Yeah, he's... I...

301
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,855
I can't believe they call Toby "Queef."
Toby kicks ass.

302
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:27,823
What did those guys want?

303
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:32,020
A couple of high school kids
looking to crash here for the weekend.

304
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,838
One of them was Queef's cousin.
Remember him?

305
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:38,963
God, that guy could toss a salad.
That thing he did with his tongue?

306
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:42,001
Sorry. That guy's a loser.

307
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:45,104
So, they're looking
for a place to crash, huh?

308
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,649
- Maybe we should let them stay.
- What, are you serious?

309
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:50,735
What the hell
are we gonna do with a bunch

310
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,623
of fucking high school kids
here all weekend?

311
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,518
Brothers.
- Do it, man!

312
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,910
- Listen up.
- Boner.

313
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:02,991
Goose, shut the fuck up.

314
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:07,733
These guys. What's your names?

315
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:10,037
I'm Kevin, and this is Morris and Carter.

316
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:12,657
Okay, whatever. These guys are
our guests for the weekend.

317
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,790
Well, see, technically,
we're supposed to stay in the dorms,

318
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:18,831
but our roommate's a little...

319
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:20,147
Technically, you're a fag!
...preoccupied.

320
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,623
Yeah, he's jerking off.

321
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:24,339
Pussy! Fuck hole!
Did we say you could talk?

322
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,085
Bearcat! Relax, big man.
They didn't mean anything by it.

323
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:32,662
Sorry. He's got anger management issues.

324
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,616
How about I show you guys
where you are staying?

325
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:36,022
Put your stuff away?

326
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,779
- Morris, do you like the sound of that?
- Party!

327
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,985
Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

328
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:42,063
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

329
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:44,110
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

330
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:45,940
- Party! Party! Party!
- Party! Party! Party!

331
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:47,921
What's up, shit face?

332
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,774
This is usually
where we let our pledges stay.

333
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:55,695
We call this room the dungeon,
but don't let the name scare you.

334
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:58,967
You're gonna love it.

335
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,871
Watch the step.

336
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,368
Yeah, this place fucking sucks.

337
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,709
Dude, it beats some guy jerking, all right?

338
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,005
Like we said, all of our guest rooms
are taken tonight.

339
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:33,072
Yeah. We feel really bad
about having to put you guys down here.

340
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:36,559
- Is that a rat?
- A rat? No. Probably just a shadow.

341
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,192
And don't you guys worry.

342
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:41,078
We're gonna give you the 411
on all the great parties this weekend.

343
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:45,399
In fact, I think that the Lambdas
are having a kegger tonight.

344
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:47,886
Keggers? We love keggers.
Right, Kev? Keggers, keggers!

345
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,335
We are all about keggers.

346
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,596
Cool. Well, you guys
are gonna love the Lambdas.

347
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,445
Bearcat!

348
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:03,694
- What the fuck is up with that...
- Are you talking?

349
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:07,216
- No, man. I'm chilling. What?
- Yeah. Shut the fuck up.

350
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,792
So excited!

351
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:16,402
All right, guys. This is it. Party time.

352
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,284
Let's do the rundown. Rubbers?

353
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:21,489
Check.

354
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,218
Breath mints?

355
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:27,796
Check.

356
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,206
Retainers?

357
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,821
I was kidding. That's so fucking gross.
Put that away.

358
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,361
- So, you guys sure about this?
- Relax, man. It's just a frat party.

359
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,309
What?

360
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,719
What? We're here to learn
about college, right?

361
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:47,988
God, I love the new attitude, Kevin.
It looks good on you, man.

362
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:49,746
It makes your eyes pop
and your hair shine.

363
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:53,394
It makes your shirt look better.
Good times. Good times. All right, guys.

364
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:57,271
Hold onto your socks,
because this is going to be awesome.

365
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:02,998
Hey, guys! Come on in!
The kegs are full and the Jacuzzi's hot!

366
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,176
Yeah!

367
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:05,905
Party!

368
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,601
Yeah!

369
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:12,501
What's up? Going on? Ladies?

370
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:18,773
There's a lot of dudes here, right?

371
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:21,207
Yeah. It's a total sausage fest.

372
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:23,896
Check it out!

373
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:27,375
These guys are so drunk
they're making out with each other.

374
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:28,790
Morris, I don't think they're drunk.

375
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:31,158
Who wants to play
glow-in-the-dark boners now?

376
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:34,768
It's boner tag! It's boner tag!

377
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:45,553
Why would they send us
to an all-gay fraternity? Do we look gay?

378
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:49,813
Maybe they found out how many times
you've been laid and just assumed.

379
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,025
Real funny, Carter.

380
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:55,568
Look, my cousin's a legacy. I doubt
they're gonna do that to us on purpose.

381
00:20:56,504 --> 00:21:00,082
Don't worry!
That was not full of my piss or anything.

382
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,994
Just Bearcat's.

383
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,144
Yeah!

384
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:06,867
Hey, how was the party?
Did you guys find any dates?

385
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,856
Yeah, real funny, guys.
We almost got jumped back there.

386
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:11,855
Watch your step, pre-frosh!
This ain't high school!

387
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,578
Welcome to college, boys. Enjoy.

388
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:18,264
Crap.

389
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,325
<i>Don't talk about it</i>

390
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:26,166
<i>Oh, boy, don't talk about it</i>

391
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:29,941
<i>If you do, I'll die</i>

392
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,869
Holy shit! This is insane!

393
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:41,587
No, man. This is fucking college.

394
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:47,568
God bless America for such a place!

395
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:50,359
Let's rock this bitch.

396
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:01,174
Hey! Hey! Hey! What's up, fellows?

397
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:05,645
Look, we feel like absolute shit
for what happened earlier.

398
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:09,943
- Yeah. We think you guys are cool.
- Yeah. It was just a joke.

399
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:13,172
We weren't trying to be
like assholes or anything.

400
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:14,765
Let us make it up to you.

401
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:16,247
We're gonna go do some body shots.

402
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,344
And we would love it
if you guys would come with us.

403
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:20,855
Dude, we are so down!

404
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:23,374
Actually, you know what?
I just filled up, so I'm cool.

405
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:26,066
Yeah, I think I'm gonna take a pass, too.

406
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:29,581
Lame and lamer.

407
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,510
Just saying, man, I guess Gina was right.

408
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:38,486
Dude, where's the bathroom?

409
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:41,967
All right. All right, you know what?
Fuck it! I'm in.

410
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,229
- Bottle.
- This is awesome.

411
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:52,626
Salt.

412
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:56,850
Limes.

413
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:01,205
And lube.

414
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,270
- What the hell is that for?
-  Just in case.

415
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:08,816
We probably won't need it. You guys...
You guys are gonna love this.

416
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,807
Where did the girls go?

417
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:11,832
Unfortunately,

418
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:14,486
the girls had to go home early.

419
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:18,452
So who are we doing body shots off of?

420
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:21,455
- Great question, Mike.
- Morris.

421
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,789
Bearcat was nice enough
to take their place.

422
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:26,262
Bearcat?

423
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:30,061
Yeah!

424
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:45,173
That's right, motherfuckers!

425
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:47,127
- Okay, we're outta here, let's go.
- Yeah.

426
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:48,369
Where are you guys going?

427
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:52,597
Yeah, we thought you guys were cool.
We thought you wanted to party.

428
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:54,354
Guess we were wrong.

429
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:58,100
Well, have fun back at the dorm,
you fucking pussies.

430
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:52,245
Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

431
00:24:52,344 --> 00:24:54,613
- Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

432
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:57,079
- Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

433
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:58,933
Do that shot!
- Yeah!

434
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:00,461
Do that shot! Do it!

435
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,495
Watch this!

436
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,566
You are my best friend!

437
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:23,119
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

438
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,336
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

439
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,066
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

440
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:28,721
Everything's spinning around me.
I'm drunk right now.

441
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:32,173
Doing shots of tequila out of
some guy's ass crack will do that to you.

442
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,647
Whatever, man. You guys
are lightweights. I don't feel shit!

443
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:36,271
Is that a fat joke, you bitch?

444
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:38,198
- Here! Video me!
- Okay.

445
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:42,776
Yeah, wait till Gina sees this! Party!

446
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,367
Party!

447
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:57,199
<i>Pump up your fist</i>
<i>If you twist like this</i>

448
00:25:57,304 --> 00:25:58,417
<i>Till the lights go out</i>

449
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,698
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

450
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:02,902
<i>Katie</i>

451
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,650
<i>I don't know why I even try</i>

452
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:07,857
<i>'Cause lately</i>

453
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,447
<i>You're always out with other guys</i>

454
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:12,886
<i>Pretty baby</i>

455
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:15,373
<i>Don't you know I'll treat you right</i>

456
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,868
<i>I'll go crazy</i>

457
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:21,107
<i>If you pass me up tonight</i>

458
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:23,669
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

459
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,004
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

460
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:28,438
<i>All this time can't get it off my mind</i>

461
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,096
<i>Dance the night away</i>

462
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,127
<i>Keep rocking with me</i>

463
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:33,395
<i>When the grooves all right</i>
<i>Rocking all night</i>

464
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:35,470
<i>I want to hear you say</i>

465
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:38,221
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

466
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:39,571
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

467
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:40,915
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

468
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,219
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

469
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,813
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

470
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,934
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

471
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,827
<i>Pump up your fist</i>
<i>If you twist like this</i>

472
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:50,095
<i>Till the lights go out</i>

473
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:51,129
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

474
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:52,851
<i>Wake up</i>

475
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:55,507
<i>I'm calling you up</i>
<i>I need a ride</i>

476
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,649
<i>We're gonna shake up</i>

477
00:26:57,754 --> 00:27:00,372
<i>So hurry it up, no wasted time</i>

478
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:03,408
<i>The girls in their makeup</i>
<i>In black and white</i>

479
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:05,652
<i>Exchanging looks tonight</i>

480
00:27:05,753 --> 00:27:08,502
<i>I just ran into some other friends of mine</i>

481
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,936
<i>Someone's coming round</i>
<i>To pick them up at nine</i>

482
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:13,455
<i>All the girls and the boys</i>
<i>And people making noise</i>

483
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:14,510
<i>Just let me hear you shout</i>

484
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,079
<i>Bring them out</i>
<i>Bring them out</i>

485
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:18,638
Fuck yeah!

486
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:31,057
Drink!

487
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:35,569
- Sorry. What?
- I made the shot. Now you drink.

488
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:38,127
Yeah, yeah, right. Cool. All right.

489
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:45,361
- So when do I get a turn?
- When I miss.

490
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,690
You kids having fun?

491
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:52,752
What? I can't play?

492
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:58,864
What do you say we wrap up this game
and bring it up to my room?

493
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:00,659
Minus the dickhead.

494
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,701
Yeah. I think I'll pass.

495
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:10,774
Could I get the beer? No?
Later? Well, okay.

496
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,446
- What an a-hole.
- Tell me about it.

497
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:16,693
Anyway, where were we?

498
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,080
Nice.

499
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:25,303
Nitrous in the hizzie!
Who wants a balloon?

500
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:29,942
Granola Bar! Can I have one, please?

501
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:32,144
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
The lady needs a balloon.

502
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:34,003
There you go, darling,
that one's just for you.

503
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:36,045
- I'm gonna sit.
- All right.

504
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:43,500
Hey, here you go. Have a balloon.

505
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,290
This balloon's for you! Have a balloon!

506
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:49,140
No, no.

507
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:54,672
You have to inhale it.
It makes chicks crazy horny, like her.

508
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:56,273
Wow.

509
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:01,586
Feel the flow.

510
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:09,841
Hey, I saw a laundry room back there.
You want to go make out or something?

511
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:13,173
- Oh, my God! Are you serious?
- Yeah.

512
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:17,046
I haven't heard a line like that since,
like, high school. Later.

513
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:19,764
You've got flat tits!

514
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,904
Do you mind?

515
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,651
What? Yeah, absolutely.
Have a... Have a sip.

516
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,279
Or down the whole thing.
That's cool. Whatever.

517
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,740
I'm so getting laid.
Excuse me. Excuse me!

518
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:44,588
Excuse me. Excuse me!

519
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,255
What's up? How's it going?

520
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,628
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

521
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:50,549
You're bigger than me.
Excuse me! Excuse me!

522
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,968
This is awesome!

523
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,832
Wait. What was that?

524
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:19,123
Shit! I think someone's coming.

525
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:23,437
- No, no, no. The bed, the bed!
- What?

526
00:30:23,543 --> 00:30:24,590
- I'm not gonna fit under there!
- You'll fit!

527
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:27,378
- I will not fit under this bed.
- Get under!

528
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,006
Are you sure this room's okay?

529
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:37,560
It's fine. Relax, okay?
Everyone's downstairs.

530
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:40,221
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Positive.

531
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:43,805
I'm just a little nervous, you know?
I've never really been with a girl before.

532
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,567
Don't worry.
I'll be gentle. I promise.

533
00:31:04,992 --> 00:31:07,992
Morris, maybe it's because
I'm really high right now,

534
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:10,268
but I will just go for this.

535
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,671
Go for what? You want another...

536
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:27,066
Sorry. Your hand is down my pants.

537
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,991
I know. Just relax.

538
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,549
Sweet!

539
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,452
Oh, God! That feels so good!

540
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:39,641
- Your hands are like butter!
- Are like butter.

541
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:44,028
You know, normally,
I'd be doing this to myself,

542
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:46,941
but this is way better.

543
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:50,302
Plus, I don't have to worry
about my mom walking in, and...

544
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:59,096
Heather? Hello?

545
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:03,312
Damn it! So close!

546
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:06,653
Cop!

547
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,728
- What's your problem?
- Hey, come on.

548
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,485
- Run!
- Who is that?

549
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,221
Party's busted! Everybody run!

550
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:21,952
That sucks.

551
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,136
That feels so good.

552
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:33,885
I almost forgot.
- You carry that with you?

553
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:36,125
They don't call it
a pocket rocket for nothing.

554
00:32:41,923 --> 00:32:43,297
You got it?

555
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,561
Yeah. I got it. Where were we?

556
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:55,201
I didn't know you were so kinky.

557
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,307
Yeah!

558
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:04,152
Kiss me. Kiss me now.

559
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,397
Really?
- Kiss me!

560
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:08,156
Do it!

561
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:10,811
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

562
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:13,303
Are you sure?
- Yeah. Just relax.

563
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,225
What the fuck do you know
about welfare reform?

564
00:33:16,322 --> 00:33:18,711
Come on down and check it out.

565
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:35,256
So, I don't really know what this means,

566
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:40,509
but Amy says that she's under the bed
with your friend Carter.

567
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:45,182
- Should I be worried?
- Yeah, definitely.

568
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,744
Okay.

569
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:49,600
Wait a second.
Why aren't they on top of the bed?

570
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:51,585
That's a good question.

571
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:56,831
So what are you guys? Freshmen?

572
00:33:58,627 --> 00:34:01,344
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're freshmen. Yep.

573
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:03,035
What's your major?

574
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:04,927
Uh...

575
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,393
- Photography.
- Really?

576
00:34:08,098 --> 00:34:12,408
I love photography.
I really suck, but that's cool.

577
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:14,173
I heard they have
a really great program here.

578
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:16,729
Yeah. It's supposed to be
one of the best in the country.

579
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:19,322
Maybe you can give me
a lesson sometime.

580
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:20,888
Yeah, sure.

581
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:26,967
That was so hot.

582
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:28,668
Please tell me you're as horny
as I am right now.

583
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,719
- Hornier.
- Good.

584
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:30,971
What's up, man?

585
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:34,849
Wow, motherfucker,
I can't believe we did that shit last night.

586
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:49,888
What the...

587
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,214
Christmas came early!

588
00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:08,350
- Here we are.
- Yep. Here we are.

589
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,408
You know, you're different
than most college guys.

590
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:16,158
Well, you know,
I don't even really feel like a college guy.

591
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,712
Yeah. I could tell.
But it's a good thing.

592
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:26,849
- Maybe I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

593
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:29,950
- I hope so.
- Okay. Bye.

594
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,643
<i>In the night sky</i>

595
00:35:33,186 --> 00:35:36,088
<i>In the night sky</i>

596
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:39,969

598
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:54,271
- Kevin!
- Jesus, what?

599
00:35:55,395 --> 00:35:56,704
What do you want?

600
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:30,266
Morris. Wake up, sleepy.

601
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:41,243
Holy shit. Did we...

602
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:43,582
Heck, yeah! All night long.

603
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,080
Give it to me again, big boy!

604
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:48,698
This is the greatest day of my life.

605
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:54,204
Hey, Dad. Dad! What are you doing here?

606
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:59,456
You missed your interview, Morris.
You blew it, the scholarship, Fieldmont,

607
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:02,112
everything.

608
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:12,796
Shit!

609
00:37:15,906 --> 00:37:17,499
The interview!

610
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:28,990
<i>Give it up</i>

611
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:33,342
<i>Give it up</i>

612
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:37,726
<i>Give it up</i>

613
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:41,814
<i>Give it up</i>

614
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:50,522
Apparently, Mr. Hooper's a no-show.

615
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,384
Thank God!

616
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:00,288
You're still here. I'm sorry I'm late.

617
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:09,503
Now, behind me is the bronze statue
of a revolutionary war hero,

618
00:38:09,602 --> 00:38:11,773
General W.S. Fieldmont.

619
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:15,518
It has become one of
the most sacred landmarks of our time.

620
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:21,279
My life is over.
My parents are gonna disown me.

621
00:38:21,378 --> 00:38:26,047
- Dude, they probably didn't even notice.
- Didn't notice? Did you see my face?

622
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:30,263
Yeah, dude, I did.
That shit was so funny.

623
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,850
Whatever, dude. Just kiss
the scholarship bye-bye and move on.

624
00:38:33,954 --> 00:38:35,295
And where the hell is Kevin, by the way?

625
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:37,761
You know, he should've been here by now.
This is his campus tour.

626
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:41,567
He probably just hooked up last night.
At least someone did.

627
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:44,538
You don't think
something happened to him, do you?

628
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:48,090
Dude, it's college.
What could possibly happen to him?

629
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:12,866
Looking good, Kev.
A lot hairier than I thought you'd be.

630
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,606
- Check it out.
- Hey!

631
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:23,226
- Nice diaper!
- Looking good, buddy!

632
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:29,342
Okay. This is really embarrassing.

633
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:31,743
Yeah, it's not really
the highlight of my day either, Carter.

634
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:33,052
Why would they do this to you?

635
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:37,758
I don't know. Because they can, I guess.
There's some clothes in my car. Try...

636
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,196
Maybe we should just go home.

637
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:48,956
We're not going anywhere, all right?
Not yet.

638
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:51,360
Why not? What are you trying to prove?

639
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:54,774
I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm just trying to have fun.

640
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:57,435
Amen to that! God, I love the new Kevin!

641
00:39:57,538 --> 00:39:59,163
You call this having a good time?

642
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:02,528
I'll get back at them.
It could have been worse.

643
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,375
What could be worse than getting
duct-taped naked to a statue all night?

644
00:40:05,698 --> 00:40:09,047
<i>Hey, what's up, Gina?</i>
<i>It's that boring guy you dumped!</i>

645
00:40:09,154 --> 00:40:10,812
<i>Fieldmont rocks!</i>

646
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:22,880
Dude, maybe the message
didn't even send.

647
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:25,499
You know what?
Whatever, I'm kind of hoping it did.

648
00:40:25,602 --> 00:40:28,864
Really? Well, in that case,
let's do like a whole Kevin party series.

649
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:30,685
- We'll post it online...
- Yeah, dude, don't push it.

650
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:31,898
Okay.

651
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:37,210
Come on, Morris.
Being stuck here isn't the worst thing.

652
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:39,703
You know, I mean,
it's probably for the best.

653
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,955
How's it for the best?

654
00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:43,360
Because if you went home now,
you know exactly what would happen.

655
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:46,774
Yeah! Your parents would go ape-shit
on your ass for blowing the big interview.

656
00:40:46,882 --> 00:40:49,184
And now at least you could probably talk
to that Dean Chandler guy.

657
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:51,191
You know, explain what happened.

658
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:52,923
You really think that would work?

659
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:55,131
I think it's worth a shot.
What do you have to lose?

660
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:56,346
And you may see that Heather chick again

661
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,871
and get more than a half hand job.

662
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:02,814
I think he'll definitely see her again.

663
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:07,583
Yeah.

664
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:37,848
By the way, I sort of accidentally
told Kendall we were in college last night.

665
00:41:46,558 --> 00:41:48,598
Looks like those high school fuckers
aren't as stupid as we thought.

666
00:41:48,703 --> 00:41:50,558
They got front row seats to nipple city.

667
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,203
Motherfuckers!

668
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,589
It's part of the whole
sorority experience.

669
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:05,110
Fraternities throw parties,
and we have charity events.

670
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:07,003
Nice! Are any of them naked?

671
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,126
All right, bitches, you're up!
This isn't social hour!

672
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:12,922
So I guess you better go, huh?

673
00:42:13,023 --> 00:42:14,878
Yeah, but maybe if you're lucky,

674
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:17,593
we'll let you guys buy us
a few beers tonight at Bruno's.

675
00:42:17,695 --> 00:42:19,451
- What's that?
- A bar.

676
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:22,553
Wait. You guys do go to bars, right?

677
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,421
- Bars? Yeah. All the time.
- Every day. I'm always at the bar.

678
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,356
Just make sure you bring this guy.

679
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,276
- This guy?
- Me?

680
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:33,593
Yeah, you.

681
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:37,175
Last night was the first frat party
I actually enjoyed.

682
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:38,840
Because of me?

683
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:42,430
- Okay.
- Well, we'll see you guys tonight then.

684
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,515
Hey, I was thinking maybe we could,
you know,

685
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:49,403
finish what we started last night.

686
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:52,602
Maybe.
Just try not to pass out on me this time.

687
00:42:56,286 --> 00:42:57,301
God, that girl fucking rocks.

688
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:02,039
- Kev?
- Yeah?

689
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:07,960
On a scale of one to ten,
I like boobies at, like, 9,000. Seriously.

690
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:09,919
What's up, fellows?

691
00:43:10,592 --> 00:43:11,541
Hey, Kevin!

692
00:43:11,648 --> 00:43:15,871
Heard you and the General got a
little cozy last night. Jesus Christ!

693
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,422
Yeah. Yeah, that was a good one, Teague.

694
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:22,325
Hey, I don't suppose you know
what happened to my car, do you?

695
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,607
- So that's how it's gonna be, Teague?
- That's right, pre-frosh.

696
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:31,519
In fact, we got a job
for you three douche bags.

697
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,591
What kind of job?

698
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:37,625
Nothing much. We're just gonna need you
to clean the house for our party tonight.

699
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:41,852
Maybe wash my car.
You know how I like to keep my ride clean.

700
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,123
Where did I put them keys?

701
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:57,849
- Fuck that! No!
- Am I sensing some hostility?

702
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:58,966
Wait, are you guys serious?

703
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:00,446
Well, you guys didn't think
your room and board

704
00:44:00,544 --> 00:44:01,853
were gonna be free here, did you?

705
00:44:01,952 --> 00:44:03,927
We're not cleaning your house!
No fucking way!

706
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,715
Well, maybe your little girlfriends
over there would like to find out

707
00:44:06,816 --> 00:44:09,085
you guys are still in high school.

708
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:10,493
How do you know
we didn't already tell them?

709
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:14,869
Because if you did, they wouldn't be
giving you the time of day, you little dicks.

710
00:44:14,977 --> 00:44:17,278
Better get to work now, boys!

711
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:19,002
Pick the keys up.

712
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:23,480
Boom!

713
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:28,826
And Kevin? Kevy?

714
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:31,996
Don't waste your time with Kendall.

715
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:34,268
You don't want my sloppy seconds,
do you?

716
00:44:34,368 --> 00:44:37,664
Unless you're into that?
You fucking sicko! Go inside.

717
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:46,999
Dude, why do we have to clean?
Don't they got pledges to do this shit?

718
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:49,952
Dude, I think this weekend
we are the pledges.

719
00:45:03,424 --> 00:45:05,399
<i>Don't let them take it all away</i>

720
00:45:09,824 --> 00:45:11,929
<i>I'm down on my luck</i>
<i>I'm out on the streets</i>

721
00:45:12,032 --> 00:45:14,366
<i>I'm at wit's end</i>
<i>I've nearly been beat</i>

722
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:17,333
<i>See they've taken my home</i>
<i>They've taken my wife</i>

723
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,644
<i>They've taken my job</i>
<i>And they've taken my life</i>

724
00:45:19,744 --> 00:45:22,265
<i>But there's one thing</i>
<i>That they will not take</i>

725
00:45:22,368 --> 00:45:24,987
<i>That I will hold till the end</i>
<i>Until my dying day</i>

726
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:27,609
<i>'Cause it's part of me</i>
<i>And it's time that we say</i>

727
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:30,614
<i>They will not take it all away!</i>

728
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:46,941
<i>Don't let them take it all away</i>

729
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,278
<i>It's getting harder every day</i>

730
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:57,526
<i>Brothers, sisters, hear me say</i>

731
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:04,189
<i>I'm pounding the pavement</i>
<i>Through thick and thin</i>

732
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:06,557
<i>Good times and bad</i>
<i>I just can't win</i>

733
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:09,503
<i>I've been beat on, kicked on</i>
<i>Insulted to my face</i>

734
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,804
<i>The whole bleeding world thinks</i>
<i>I'm a bleeding disgrace</i>

735
00:46:11,904 --> 00:46:14,751
<i>Yeah, they can own my body</i>
<i>But they'll never own my mind</i>

736
00:46:14,848 --> 00:46:16,987
<i>So they better face the facts</i>
<i>'Cause now is the time</i>

737
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:19,936
<i>Till we all join hands</i>
<i>And all of us say</i>

738
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:22,749
<i>They will not take it all away</i>

739
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:36,539
That's really funny.
'Cause I've been cleaning all day,

740
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,942
so you think that it'd be funny
to come in and throw a cup down.

741
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,887
Because I've been working really hard
and you want to ruin that for me.

742
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:45,562
I love that! You're just...
You're so fucking cool, you bitch.

743
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:48,893
Yeah, get some, you punk-ass bitch!
Come here, you steaming fuck!

744
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,296
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- You want that scholarship, don't you?

745
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:04,537
Go on.

746
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:13,978
Come on, man! You can do it!
I believe in you! You're the coolest, bro!

747
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,336
- Yeah, he's totally fucked. Yep.
- Yeah, totally.

748
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:19,996
Shit! Run away!

749
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:27,196
Let's just say that this morning was,
well, rather shocking.

750
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:30,611
Heck, I didn't even know
what some of those words meant.

751
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:32,888
I had to search the Internet for them.

752
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,146
But I guess that's what happens
when you choose to stay at a frat house,

753
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:40,060
rather than the dorm room
we assigned you.

754
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,940
I know, sir. It was a bad choice.

755
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:47,893
Christ, if I had my way,
I'd kick every fraternity off this campus.

756
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:52,852
Do you know that those animals
suck nitrous oxide

757
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,990
out of balloons just to get high?

758
00:47:56,093 --> 00:47:58,232
Really? That's just awful!

759
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:05,117
Mr. Hooper, there is no doubt
that you are academically gifted,

760
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:11,252
but the scholarships we give out here
are about much more than just that.

761
00:48:11,357 --> 00:48:13,266
Dean Chandler, that's me.

762
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:16,052
My family has a long history at Fieldmont,

763
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:18,710
and I'd like to continue that legacy.

764
00:48:18,814 --> 00:48:21,301
Well, you know, son, I guess
you're gonna have to prove it to me.

765
00:48:21,405 --> 00:48:23,260
For, as of right now, Mr. Hooper,

766
00:48:23,357 --> 00:48:27,351
you and your scholarship
are hanging by a thread.

767
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:35,352
God! You're so lame!

768
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:37,209
Dude, where have you been? It's go time!

769
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,685
Relax! Relax!
I just had to run a little errand.

770
00:48:42,621 --> 00:48:46,330
All my years of hard work
have finally paid off! That's my boy.

771
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:50,550
- Nice.
- What's wrong, Morris?

772
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:55,223
What's wrong?
I'm having a breakdown, Kevin!

773
00:48:55,325 --> 00:48:57,114
Or have you forgotten what that feels like?

774
00:48:57,213 --> 00:48:59,101
- I understand, man.
- What am I gonna do?

775
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:02,906
Somehow, I have to convince the Dean
that I actually want to go here.

776
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:05,078
Well, look, there's nothing
you can do about it tonight, all right?

777
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:08,858
- So let's just go get our girls. Here.
- This doesn't even look like me.

778
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:10,899
Whatever, Morris. Just tell the bouncer
you don't photograph well.

779
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:12,467
Let me see it.

780
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:18,165
Dude, this will totally work!
You guys are both just so ugly.

781
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:20,309
You're a little uglier, but it'll be good.
Don't worry about it.

782
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:23,928
Laquisha?

783
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:27,674
Man, you actually expect me
to buy that your name is Laquisha?

784
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:30,866
You know what? I like how you roll, dog.
You in.

785
00:49:30,973 --> 00:49:33,111
10 bucks cover tonight, guys.

786
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:35,734
Shit!

787
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:38,835
- Sorry, guys. No dough, no go.
- Fuck!

788
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:40,661
Let the ladies through.

789
00:49:40,765 --> 00:49:43,100
Let the ladies through.
Let the ladies through.

790
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:47,255
- What was that? They didn't pay.
- Did you see the size of those racks?

791
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:52,308
- No.
- Yeah, you big, big man.

792
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:54,835
You like that when
I squeeze them together for you?

793
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:55,868
I said no.

794
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:02,066
I cannot believe
those assholes ripped us off.

795
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:04,540
They've done pretty much
everything else to us so far this weekend.

796
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:06,328
Why not that?

797
00:50:06,429 --> 00:50:07,858
Man, do you think this is
what it's going to be like

798
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:10,780
- when we're really in college?
- Who knows?

799
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:13,845
Well, we probably won't all be together.
I know that.

800
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:16,437
God, Morris, you're such a fucking baby!
Would you stop being a girl?

801
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:19,575
- Would you please just shut up?
- What? It's true!

802
00:50:19,677 --> 00:50:22,938
Think about it, guys. This is it!
Senior year.

803
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:26,867
Man, he's right. This is it.

804
00:50:26,973 --> 00:50:29,275
You know, all the more of a reason
to take advantage of being here.

805
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:30,868
All right, I'm not sitting around.
Come on, you guys!

806
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:31,955
Where are you going?

807
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:34,450
What do you think?
We've got a frat party to go to. Come on!

808
00:50:34,557 --> 00:50:36,859
- What about the girls?
- Shut up.

809
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:41,844
- It hurts.
- Morris, let's go!

810
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:43,291
Come on.

811
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:46,236
- Wait for me!
- You're so slow! You're so slow!

812
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:50,002
<i>I was on my way up</i>
<i>She was on her way down</i>

813
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:53,721
<i>And I didn't know I crossed that line</i>

814
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:58,131
<i>Make me sick to my stomach</i>
<i>When I think of that woman</i>

815
00:50:58,237 --> 00:51:00,920
<i>Sitting in this cell of mine</i>

816
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:05,052
<i>I said, "Goddamn, I'm only a man"</i>

817
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:08,183
<i>Give me 15 years to life</i>

818
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:10,744
<i>Jailbait</i>

819
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:41,911
Come on, cowboy.

820
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:44,500
Yeah!

821
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:48,343
You guys ready to celebrate?
All right!

822
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:53,591
Where's my whip?

823
00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:57,274
You want to be my bitch, huh?

824
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:02,778
Pass it on.

825
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:35,189
- Fellows, it's not polite to stare!
- What the fuck, man? What's up?

826
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:39,353
Ladies, I want you to meet
some very special guests.

827
00:52:39,453 --> 00:52:41,046
- Hi, boys.
- What's up?

828
00:52:41,149 --> 00:52:44,695
- Hi, cutie.
- Me? Hi.

829
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:46,968
Wait. You're the <i>Penthouse</i>
Pet of the Year.

830
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:48,148
Mmm-hmm.

831
00:52:48,253 --> 00:52:51,482
- And you're...
- On the cover of <i>Penthouse Letters.</i>

832
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:54,264
Fellows!
Good for you for staying current.

833
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:59,736
Where were we? Where were we?
Where were...

834
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:04,696
Yeah, that's right. Ladies?

835
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:07,928
These guys were nice enough
to pay for all this.

836
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:10,451
Wait a second. That's what you did
with our money? You paid for this party?

837
00:53:10,556 --> 00:53:13,339
Hey, kegs aren't cheap these days,
my man.

838
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,346
Neither are the circus animals
we got coming later.

839
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:17,079
Wait! You couldn't have paid for this.

840
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,555
We didn't even have
that much money in our wallets.

841
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,133
- Yeah.
- Yeah. What's up with that?

842
00:53:22,237 --> 00:53:23,895
Luckily, you guys had some plastic.

843
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:25,720
God, my parents gave me that
in case of an emergency.

844
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,708
Well, good thing they got
such a high limit!

845
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:31,252
We almost maxed those puppies out.
Especially on this guy.

846
00:53:31,901 --> 00:53:33,275
Verne Troyer?

847
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:35,894
- That's Mini-Me.
- Verne!

848
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:42,359
- Why do you keep hitting me? Fuck!
- Shut up, bitch!

849
00:53:43,357 --> 00:53:44,731
Fucking Mini-Me.

850
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:47,960
It was Bearcat's idea.
God, I love that guy.

851
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:53,330
Anyhow, we've gotta go be social.

852
00:53:53,437 --> 00:53:56,852
You douche bags have fun. Okay? Okay.

853
00:53:56,957 --> 00:53:58,069
Babies?

854
00:54:00,925 --> 00:54:03,925
That was so weird, but so hot!
Dude, she grabbed my nipple!

855
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:05,938
Dude, she twisted my nipple, dude!

856
00:54:06,045 --> 00:54:09,143
So, basically, this is our party.

857
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:13,947
- Yeah. In a roundabout way, I guess it is.
- Why don't I like where this is going?

858
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:16,052
Come on, Morris! I mean, we paid for it.
We may as well enjoy it.

859
00:54:16,157 --> 00:54:18,644
- That's my boy!
- Come on! Who wants to keg stand?

860
00:54:18,749 --> 00:54:21,531
Me! Me! I'm first!
I wanna go first! Please.

861
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:28,690
- Have you ever done one of these before?
- No, but it looks like fun, huh, man?

862
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:29,974
Yeah. Real fun.

863
00:54:30,077 --> 00:54:31,637
All right, here,
make sure you get a good shot.

864
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:34,043
Wait, I thought you didn't want
to send Gina any more videos.

865
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,279
I changed my mind, all right?
Wait till she sees this one.

866
00:54:36,381 --> 00:54:38,268
- Nice!
- Kev, come on.

867
00:54:38,365 --> 00:54:41,147
What's happening?
You don't have to do this.

868
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:44,187
Yeah, I do, Morris, all right?
And you should lighten up and do one, too.

869
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,040
Yeah, fuck nugget.

870
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:48,759
Me? No way. That's a bad idea.

871
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:51,894
- I'm already on thin ice with the Dean.
- Whatever!

872
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:57,307
You know what? I think I'm gonna go
and find something non-alcoholic to drink.

873
00:54:57,405 --> 00:54:58,485
You guys have fun puking on yourselves.

874
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:01,785
Okay. We will, buddy. I love you!
Call me later. Be safe.

875
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:05,146
- All right, whatever. Let's do this thing!
- All right.

876
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:08,027
Yeah. Be careful with him, guys.
He's fragile.

877
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:10,329
Bitches spit, Kev. Bitches spit.

878
00:55:22,076 --> 00:55:25,208
- Hey, is there alcohol in there?
- In the punch?

879
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:29,365
No, not at all.

880
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:33,778
In fact, this is non-alcoholic
for our designated drivers.

881
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:38,297
- Really?
- Big old Bearcat wouldn't lie to you.

882
00:55:38,396 --> 00:55:41,593
After last night, I feel like we bonded.

883
00:55:41,692 --> 00:55:45,718
In fact, if you don't believe me,
have a taste.

884
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:49,721
Hey, can I have some punch?

885
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,992
Hey, safety first.

886
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:54,712
- Another designated driver.
- Thank you.

887
00:55:58,237 --> 00:56:03,638
- Wow! It's pretty good.
- Drink up, buddy. You look thirsty.

888
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:06,643
Thanks, Bearcat. You're all right.

889
00:56:06,748 --> 00:56:09,399
Listen to me. If anybody,

890
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:13,778
and I mean anybody,
fucks with you tonight, find me.

891
00:56:13,885 --> 00:56:15,291
I got your front.

892
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:18,552
- Don't you mean "back"?
- If that's how you want it.

893
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,392
If you feel something
moving in your pants, don't fight it!

894
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:24,827
Who's fucking on my floor?

895
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:31,756
- Heather!
- I know you!

896
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:34,029
Hey, Teague, who's the blonde?

897
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:38,728
Hey! Kendall! I'm glad you made it.
Let me get you girls some beers.

898
00:56:38,834 --> 00:56:41,038
No, thanks, Teague. Not now.

899
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:45,165
If you're looking for who I think
you're looking for, don't bother.

900
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:47,917
He's a loser, him and his little friends.

901
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:51,819
Are you really that jealous?

902
00:56:51,922 --> 00:56:55,217
You had your chance, Teague,
and thank God you blew it.

903
00:57:05,146 --> 00:57:07,534
- Yeah!
- I wanna drink! I wanna drink!

904
00:57:08,473 --> 00:57:11,735
- Fuck, yeah!
- You are so awesome!

905
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,775
- Verne!
- Verne! Hey, Verne!

906
00:57:13,881 --> 00:57:16,664
- Fuck you, prick!
- I love you, too!

907
00:57:16,761 --> 00:57:19,150
- Hey, man, did you get that one?
- Dude, you fucking drained the thing!

908
00:57:19,257 --> 00:57:22,966
- Holy shit. Oh, hey, hey! Look, look!
- Ladies!

909
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,302
Hey, Kendall! Kendall, hey!

910
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:26,612
What's up, ladies?

911
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:27,990
We were hoping you guys would show up.

912
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,319
Yeah, we waited at the bar
tonight for, like, two hours.

913
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:32,912
Yeah. Way to blow us off.

914
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:36,814
Amy, girl, you know
I'd never blow you off.

915
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:41,111
Especially last night, you know,
after the lesbian thing.

916
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:43,762
Hey, hey, look, the bouncer
wouldn't let us in, 'cause our IDs sucked.

917
00:57:43,865 --> 00:57:45,774
We got in just fine,
and we don't even have ID.

918
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:49,775
Yeah, but, see, you guys got tits,
and those things are like gold.

919
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:52,944
Hey, but you know what?
You know what we're gonna do?

920
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:57,240
Let us make it up to you, okay,
'cause you still need those beers, right?

921
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:00,369
- I think you've had plenty.
- Me? Come on! Please!

922
00:58:02,201 --> 00:58:04,110
I'm just getting started.

923
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,728
All right, well,
I'm gonna get you those beers.

924
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:08,782
We're gonna get you the beers.

925
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,744
- So don't move.
- Let's go!

926
00:58:11,193 --> 00:58:14,007
- Excuse me, boobies! Look out!
- Wait. Where's Morris?

927
00:58:21,146 --> 00:58:22,672
- Cocksucking motherfucker!
- Fuck you!

928
00:58:22,777 --> 00:58:25,111
Come on back and fight like a man!

929
00:58:27,981 --> 00:58:29,737
<i>So, let's go</i>

930
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:31,723
<i>And get wasted</i>

931
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:34,956
<i>Let's go</i>
<i>Let's go</i>

932
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,474
<i>And get high</i>

933
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:39,042
<i>Let's go</i>

934
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:44,875
Look who's here!
Little high school friends.

935
00:58:44,973 --> 00:58:48,006
Hey, come on, don't be a dick, Teague.
Fill us up.

936
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,630
- What'd you say?
- I said fill us up, fucktard.

937
00:58:50,733 --> 00:58:52,195
Or is that too complicated for your small...

938
00:58:52,301 --> 00:58:55,334
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
He meant that in the nicest way possible.

939
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:58,568
Stop being an asshole, Teague,
and give them our beer.

940
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:02,346
So you want some beer for your ladies?

941
00:59:03,597 --> 00:59:04,840
All right.

942
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:10,697
You know what? You guys put up with
a lot of shit these past couple of days,

943
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,968
and you deserve this beer.

944
00:59:14,029 --> 00:59:16,004
In fact, hold on.

945
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:22,252
Hey, everybody, listen up!
I've got a quick announcement to make!

946
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:25,993
- Lay off, Teague.
- Trust me, Kendall. You're gonna love this.

947
00:59:26,765 --> 00:59:31,042
See these guys right here?
These guys are pre-frosh.

948
00:59:32,557 --> 00:59:36,102
- That's right! They're high school kids!
- High school?

949
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,187
High school?

950
00:59:37,293 --> 00:59:42,149
All right, come on now, once upon a time
we were high school kids, too.

951
00:59:43,117 --> 00:59:45,321
- No way!
- Come on.

952
00:59:45,421 --> 00:59:46,370
Grow up!

953
00:59:46,477 --> 00:59:48,103
All right, shut up!

954
00:59:48,716 --> 00:59:50,375
These guys are cool.

955
00:59:50,765 --> 00:59:53,798
They're good guys
who want a beer and a good time.

956
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:56,324
Give them one.

957
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:58,818
Here it is. Your beer.

958
01:00:08,717 --> 01:00:12,743
What the fuck?
Stop peeing on me! What are you doing?

959
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:14,536
Would you fucking stop peeing on me,
you little shit?

960
01:00:14,636 --> 01:00:19,109
Say what?
Nobody talks to my bear kitten like that!

961
01:00:19,213 --> 01:00:22,082
What me and him got,
you'll never understand.

962
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:23,465
Pick me up, bitch!

963
01:00:23,565 --> 01:00:25,670
Stop calling me bitch! This is my frat.
You're embarrassing me.

964
01:00:25,773 --> 01:00:27,115
And now let's get fucked up!

965
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:38,796
- Kendall, wait!
- Nice one.

966
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:46,530
- Oh, my word, that was fun.
- That's not dancing.

967
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:49,315
They can't dance.

968
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:51,458
Jim! Look out!

969
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:57,891
- Sweet Jesus! That was close!
- Hi! Dean Chandler!

970
01:00:57,997 --> 01:01:00,298
Just the guy I wanted to talk to.

971
01:01:03,053 --> 01:01:05,835
Oh, my God!

972
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:17,638
I'm so dead.

973
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:21,800
Yeah, well, at least you didn't get
beer poured on you by about 300 people.

974
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,591
Yeah, Kendall looked
pretty pissed back there, huh?

975
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:24,642
Pissed?

976
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:29,189
Dude, it looked like she was gonna
shoot fucking daggers out of her eyeballs.

977
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:34,022
Kev? Kev! Where you going?

978
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,842
I'm gonna go apologize.
You coming with me?

979
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:52,483
Hey! Shut the fuck up!
This is my favorite part! Watch this shit!

980
01:02:02,668 --> 01:02:03,912
Dude.

981
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:07,404
There's Goose! There's Goose!

982
01:02:08,973 --> 01:02:11,340
Shit, that's funny!
Hey, play that shit again!

983
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,931
Play it in slow-mo!

984
01:02:13,037 --> 01:02:16,353
- You guys do this shit for fun?
- All day, every day.

985
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,526
- Butch up, Goose! Stop being a pussy!
- Yeah!

986
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:26,567
I just saw those high school kids
heading over to the sorority house.

987
01:02:27,116 --> 01:02:28,458
Just saying.

988
01:02:33,101 --> 01:02:34,028
No way.

989
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:38,794
What?

990
01:02:38,892 --> 01:02:42,689
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Why? So you can tell me more lies?

991
01:02:42,797 --> 01:02:44,869
- No, thanks.
- Hey! Wait!

992
01:02:48,077 --> 01:02:51,655
- Come on, I leave tomorrow.
- You know, I thought you were different.

993
01:02:51,757 --> 01:02:55,237
But you're just like the rest of them.
Have a nice drive.

994
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,180
College blows!

995
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:02,789
You think I'll ever see Heather again?

996
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:05,740
Probably not, Morris.
I pretty much blew it for all of us.

997
01:03:05,837 --> 01:03:07,746
So that was my last shot
to score with Amy.

998
01:03:07,853 --> 01:03:09,827
All I wanna do is bang
one college chick this weekend.

999
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:11,907
Is that so much to ask?

1000
01:03:12,013 --> 01:03:13,420
What the hell?

1001
01:03:16,076 --> 01:03:17,964
My glasses! My glasses!

1002
01:03:20,653 --> 01:03:23,402
Get them in the van! Get them in.

1003
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:25,291
Get them in.

1004
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:38,689
You pukes are worthless.
- Worthless!

1005
01:03:38,797 --> 01:03:42,441
Nothing but a bunch
of goddamn high school kids!

1006
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:45,029
Goddamn high school kids!

1007
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:53,833
I can't believe we're even out here
wasting our time on you.

1008
01:03:53,932 --> 01:03:56,616
Wasting our motherfucking time!

1009
01:03:56,717 --> 01:03:59,335
Dude, what's with the repeating?
It's fucking killing me.

1010
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:03,626
Sorry! It's stupid. Can I get a hug?

1011
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:09,322
Just go stand over there
and look fucking mean.

1012
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:10,436
Do the growl thing.

1013
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:14,185
Come on, man, I'll jeeper creeper
these motherfuckers. Hug me.

1014
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,610
We got beer to drink.
So it's been fun, kind of.

1015
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:31,976
By the way,

1016
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:36,135
have you guys ever seen
a pig stampede before?

1017
01:04:36,237 --> 01:04:38,986
- Fucked up. Pig stampede.
- Pig stampede!

1018
01:04:39,085 --> 01:04:41,190
Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1019
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,813
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1020
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:46,917
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!
- Pig stampede! Pig stampede!

1021
01:04:56,013 --> 01:04:59,112
Get out of the front seat, bitch!
I called shotgun!

1022
01:05:03,948 --> 01:05:05,639
Shit! Run!

1023
01:05:14,412 --> 01:05:17,162
Keep running, you little sicko pig fuckers!

1024
01:05:22,413 --> 01:05:23,395
This sucks.

1025
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:26,796
Yeah, thanks for
stating the obvious, Carter.

1026
01:05:26,892 --> 01:05:31,497
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but I think I actually miss high school.

1027
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:35,272
- What, Kevin?
- Nothing. Forget it.

1028
01:05:35,373 --> 01:05:37,129
Don't forget it. If you have
something to say, fucking say it!

1029
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:39,563
Okay, fine, you want it? Here it is.
You're full of shit, Carter!

1030
01:05:39,661 --> 01:05:40,643
I'm full of shit?

1031
01:05:40,748 --> 01:05:42,887
Yeah! You're always talking
such a big fucking game, man.

1032
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:46,153
You know what? Newsflash!
He's never even been laid.

1033
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:53,224
- So, that's how it's gonna be, huh, Kevin?
- No, no, no. Wait. You're still a virgin?

1034
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:57,318
- Man! This is great.
- Yeah, whatever, Morris! Shut up!

1035
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,849
You know what, Kev? Stop dumping on us

1036
01:05:58,957 --> 01:06:00,866
'cause the weekend didn't turn out
the way you thought it would!

1037
01:06:00,973 --> 01:06:02,598
Yeah, probably because
I've been listening to you too much.

1038
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:06,924
Yeah, 'cause it was my idea to try
to prove Gina wrong and lie to Kendall!

1039
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,704
- That was all you, man!
- Guys, come on. Let's not fight.

1040
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:12,106
You know what? Stay out of it, Morris!
You're not part of this!

1041
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:13,514
I'm not part of this?

1042
01:06:13,613 --> 01:06:15,500
This was supposed to be yours
and my weekend here.

1043
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,025
Dude, whatever.
I didn't mean it like that.

1044
01:06:17,132 --> 01:06:18,921
No, but while we're comparing
shitty weekends,

1045
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:20,036
here's one for you.

1046
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:22,694
My face got written on
before my scholarship interview,

1047
01:06:22,797 --> 01:06:24,619
a pig just snacked on my nuts,

1048
01:06:24,717 --> 01:06:26,539
and, oh, yeah,
I almost forgot about this one,

1049
01:06:26,637 --> 01:06:28,098
I puked on the Dean's car,

1050
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:30,408
which pretty much means
that I'm not getting my scholarship!

1051
01:06:30,508 --> 01:06:31,752
God, Morris! Ever since you got here

1052
01:06:31,853 --> 01:06:33,893
you whine, whine, whine
about your fucking scholarship.

1053
01:06:33,996 --> 01:06:35,044
You don't even want to go here.

1054
01:06:35,148 --> 01:06:37,570
It's not about what I want!
You know how my parents are!

1055
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:39,978
Yeah, well, then grow some fucking balls
and stand up to them.

1056
01:06:40,077 --> 01:06:41,386
It's not that easy.

1057
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:43,656
Hey, man, what's next?
They're gonna choose what job you take?

1058
01:06:43,756 --> 01:06:46,440
- What girl you marry?
- Dude, lay off, Kev!

1059
01:06:47,244 --> 01:06:48,968
That's a first.
You're sticking up for Morris, man?

1060
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:51,851
- You bag on him more than anyone.
- That's not true and you fucking know it!

1061
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:53,061
Ha!

1062
01:06:53,996 --> 01:06:56,265
Okay, you know what, Morris? Fuck you!

1063
01:06:56,365 --> 01:06:58,754
That's the last time
I ever have your fucking back!

1064
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:03,083
You know what? Fuck you, too, Kevin,
for dumping all your bullshit on us.

1065
01:07:06,669 --> 01:07:08,360
All right, fine, Morris.
Yeah, walk away with him.

1066
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,981
Why don't you hold his hand
while you're at it?

1067
01:07:11,084 --> 01:07:14,946
- Fuck you, Kevin.
- Dropping the F-bomb, big man.

1068
01:07:15,053 --> 01:07:17,093
What is that,
the first time you ever used it?

1069
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:19,106
I'm telling your parents!

1070
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:21,347
Fuck!

1071
01:07:21,452 --> 01:07:23,591
<i>We do not know</i>

1072
01:07:26,925 --> 01:07:27,981
<i>How things work</i>

1073
01:07:27,981 --> 01:07:28,515
<i>How things work</i>

1074
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:34,599
<i>We do not know</i>

1075
01:07:38,316 --> 01:07:40,585
<i>Where you go</i>

1076
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:47,273
<i>In the night</i>

1077
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,492
<i>Through the door</i>

1078
01:07:53,549 --> 01:07:57,509
<i>Through the door that holds you</i>

1079
01:08:01,133 --> 01:08:05,126
<i>Through the door that holds you</i>

1080
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:09,858
<i>Out of the blue</i>

1081
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,817
<i>We do not know</i>

1082
01:08:24,236 --> 01:08:28,098
<i>The door that holds you</i>

1083
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,933
<i>Silent as glue</i>

1084
01:08:35,276 --> 01:08:37,480
<i>We stand under it</i>

1085
01:08:38,252 --> 01:08:40,554
<i>But we don't understand it</i>

1086
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:44,899
<i>The door that holds you</i>

1087
01:08:49,964 --> 01:08:52,550
<i>Silent as glue</i>

1088
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:59,720
<i>And stars fall on</i>

1089
01:09:02,925 --> 01:09:07,845
<i>Stars fall on</i>

1090
01:09:09,389 --> 01:09:12,106
<i>Silent as glue</i>

1091
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,461
- Nice look.
- This? Yeah, thanks.

1092
01:09:38,445 --> 01:09:39,557
So...

1093
01:09:44,172 --> 01:09:46,343
- Look, about what happened...
- Don't even go there.

1094
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:50,022
- Just let me explain.
- I really don't want to hear it, Kevin.

1095
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:51,913
I don't even know who you are.

1096
01:09:52,012 --> 01:09:54,346
Yeah, to be honest,
I'm not even sure I know anymore.

1097
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:56,866
Maybe it's time you figure that out.

1098
01:09:58,796 --> 01:10:03,499
You know, high school, college,
it wouldn't have mattered to me.

1099
01:10:03,596 --> 01:10:05,768
Yeah, I know. It's so stupid.

1100
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,763
You know, I came down here thinking
I needed to change who I was.

1101
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,900
Lying to you was just part of it.

1102
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,492
I thought you were pretty great.
Why would you want to change that?

1103
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:17,003
I don't know.

1104
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:20,236
You don't know?

1105
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:23,682
Like, I mean,
I kind of liked who I was, or I am.

1106
01:10:23,788 --> 01:10:26,821
You know, a little uptight at times,
responsible.

1107
01:10:30,956 --> 01:10:33,673
God, I really screwed up this weekend.

1108
01:10:33,773 --> 01:10:36,162
You know, now Morris and Carter
are pissed at each other.

1109
01:10:36,268 --> 01:10:38,177
They're both pissed at me.

1110
01:10:40,204 --> 01:10:44,001
You just seem like the kind of person
who doesn't make mistakes.

1111
01:10:44,364 --> 01:10:45,379
Ha!

1112
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:50,220
A couple weeks ago... Brace yourself.

1113
01:10:52,588 --> 01:10:54,443
I hooked up with Teague.

1114
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,028
- Huge mistake.
- Yeah, he kinda told me.

1115
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:01,258
Why not? He told the whole campus.

1116
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:06,408
Why'd you do it?
I mean, with a guy like Teague?

1117
01:11:06,508 --> 01:11:09,029
- He is so...
- For all the wrong reasons.

1118
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,483
He was good-looking.
He made me feel special,

1119
01:11:15,148 --> 01:11:17,537
and since he was a really good liar,

1120
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:23,078
he made believe that it was
more than just a one-night thing.

1121
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,781
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

1122
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,591
It was kind of why I freaked out tonight.

1123
01:11:33,644 --> 01:11:38,882
I found out that you lied and
I assumed that you were just like Teague.

1124
01:11:38,988 --> 01:11:41,988
Oh, God, please, look,
I'm nothing like that guy.

1125
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:46,443
I'm really sorry about everything.

1126
01:11:48,588 --> 01:11:50,955
Is this the real Kevin talking?

1127
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:54,248
Or is this the new and improved
college Kevin talking?

1128
01:11:54,348 --> 01:11:55,428
No, this is the real me,

1129
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:58,980
the uptight, responsible,
un-fun high school one.

1130
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,166
Good. Apology accepted then.

1131
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:11,239
All right, well,
I gotta go find Carter and Morris.

1132
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:16,775
Before you go,
can I please give you some clothes?

1133
01:12:20,748 --> 01:12:24,457
- Morris? Morris, wake up!
- Kevin?

1134
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,929
- What's with the...
- Where's Carter?

1135
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:39,394
Look, you guys. I've been thinking
all night. I just want to say I'm sorry

1136
01:12:40,301 --> 01:12:41,991
about everything.

1137
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:45,059
- You said some harsh things, man.
- Yeah, I know.

1138
01:12:46,092 --> 01:12:50,020
I've realized a lot about myself
this weekend, and you guys.

1139
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:51,913
I didn't mean what I said.

1140
01:12:52,012 --> 01:12:54,468
I've just been so hung up
on what Gina told me

1141
01:12:54,572 --> 01:12:58,827
that I haven't even stopped to think
that, you know, maybe she was wrong.

1142
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:01,443
You guys are my best friends.

1143
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:05,094
I'm not gonna let some stupid weekend
at college ruin that.

1144
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,377
Whatever, man. It's cool.
I like the boring Kevin more anyway.

1145
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,523
Thanks, Carter. I think.

1146
01:13:15,821 --> 01:13:17,064
Morris?

1147
01:13:18,668 --> 01:13:22,891
We all said some stuff, you know?
No biggie. I'm over it.

1148
01:13:23,788 --> 01:13:26,603
Sorry I, like, freaked out and lost my shit.

1149
01:13:32,684 --> 01:13:33,993
You guys,

1150
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:38,281
that was so gay.

1151
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,282
That was like the third gayest thing
we've done this weekend.

1152
01:13:41,388 --> 01:13:44,388
- It's getting out of hand.
- All right, look. Does this mean we're cool?

1153
01:13:44,492 --> 01:13:46,794
Yeah, man. For sure.

1154
01:13:46,893 --> 01:13:49,740
Okay! So now that we're done arguing
like a bunch of chicks,

1155
01:13:49,836 --> 01:13:54,058
- what the hell are we doing out here?
- Go ahead and look for yourselves.

1156
01:13:57,996 --> 01:14:00,101
- Is that all our stuff?
- Yeah.

1157
01:14:00,204 --> 01:14:04,360
- They even threw in all our rubbers.
- Those taint-sucking ball junkies.

1158
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:06,723
Yep.

1159
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:26,052
- Can we go home now?
- No. Not yet.

1160
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:29,254
- Dude, why the fuck would we stay?
- The weekend's over, Kevin.

1161
01:14:29,356 --> 01:14:30,883
It's pretty clear
we're not wanted here anymore.

1162
01:14:30,988 --> 01:14:32,777
Come on, you guys.
We've got to stand up for ourselves.

1163
01:14:32,876 --> 01:14:34,948
No, we don't. We need to go home.

1164
01:14:35,052 --> 01:14:36,296
Come on, man.
After all the shit we've been through?

1165
01:14:36,396 --> 01:14:38,982
We can't leave like this, Morris.

1166
01:14:39,084 --> 01:14:42,346
Besides, I can't stand up
to these fraternity assholes on my own.

1167
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:47,179
All right, fuck it! If I'm not gonna get laid,
I might as well get revenge, right?

1168
01:14:50,572 --> 01:14:53,441
Come on, Morris.
We can't do this without you.

1169
01:14:54,956 --> 01:14:58,272
Come on, man. Just think about it.
Who wrote "hairy balls" on your face?

1170
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,842
- Fraternity guys.
- Yeah.

1171
01:14:59,948 --> 01:15:02,250
Who made you wash their car,
drink out of some dude's belly button

1172
01:15:02,348 --> 01:15:03,809
and puke all over the Dean's car?

1173
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:04,898
Who stripped you naked

1174
01:15:05,004 --> 01:15:07,044
and made you feel
like a little bitch all weekend long?

1175
01:15:07,148 --> 01:15:10,661
- Fraternity guys!
- Yeah, that's right, the fraternity guys.

1176
01:15:10,764 --> 01:15:12,139
Look, man,
you want to stand up to your parents?

1177
01:15:12,236 --> 01:15:15,269
Why don't you start
by taking a stand here first?

1178
01:15:15,756 --> 01:15:18,178
Let's take those motherfuckers down.

1179
01:15:35,148 --> 01:15:36,970
Fuck!

1180
01:15:44,684 --> 01:15:47,018
One, two.

1181
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,431
- Four, five...
- Dude, open the door!

1182
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:06,699
Get over here!

1183
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:33,027
Five, four, three, two...

1184
01:17:38,252 --> 01:17:42,213
- Dude, are you sure this is going to work?
- Trust me. It's physics.

1185
01:18:06,955 --> 01:18:08,232
Fuck.

1186
01:18:24,684 --> 01:18:26,855
- What the fuck?
- Nothing's happening.

1187
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:28,363
Maybe the matches blew out.

1188
01:18:46,444 --> 01:18:47,720
What the...

1189
01:18:51,244 --> 01:18:53,251
Shit! Fuck!

1190
01:18:57,196 --> 01:18:58,625
What the fuck?

1191
01:19:15,467 --> 01:19:16,776
Fucking pig!

1192
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,521
Fucking shit!

1193
01:19:26,508 --> 01:19:27,685
Oh, shit!

1194
01:19:31,052 --> 01:19:34,347
- What the fuck is happening?
- There's pigs everywhere!

1195
01:19:39,596 --> 01:19:41,767
Fuck me! God damn it!

1196
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:46,337
What the fuck?

1197
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,384
It's beer!

1198
01:19:51,212 --> 01:19:53,034
It's fucking beer, man!

1199
01:20:11,659 --> 01:20:14,693
Hey, you guys, you got to come outside!

1200
01:20:14,795 --> 01:20:17,665
I think the Beta Chi House is on fire
or something.

1201
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,627
Fuck you, pig!

1202
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:45,863
Nice hair cut, buddy!

1203
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,138
- Bearcat.
- Wait!

1204
01:20:54,155 --> 01:20:57,384
Wait! Can I flush first, guys? Come on!

1205
01:20:57,483 --> 01:21:00,483
You boys are in a world of shit now.
Disturbing the peace,

1206
01:21:00,588 --> 01:21:02,824
destruction of property,
stealing farm animals!

1207
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:05,957
What the hell are you talking about?
It wasn't us!

1208
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:12,516
- It was those fuckers right there!
- Officer, we don't even go here.

1209
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,562
No. We're just a bunch
of high school kids.

1210
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:18,016
You know, Officer, frankly, I'm appalled
at the behavior on this campus.

1211
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:20,131
Motherfuckers!

1212
01:21:20,236 --> 01:21:21,512
Fuck you!

1213
01:21:21,612 --> 01:21:25,354
Careful there, buddy. You've got a little
cut from a straight razor on your nipple.

1214
01:21:25,452 --> 01:21:26,979
Wait, wait! Wait!

1215
01:21:28,811 --> 01:21:30,600
- Where's my car?
- Plastic pussy stole it!

1216
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,041
Where's my fucking car?

1217
01:21:38,763 --> 01:21:40,618
This was donated by
a group of our alumni.

1218
01:21:40,716 --> 01:21:43,236
This has made a very welcome addition
to our campus.

1219
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:46,820
And I'm sure that your child will embrace
their studies...

1220
01:21:46,924 --> 01:21:50,502
Why don't we go ahead, guys?
Just follow me. Come on, guys.

1221
01:21:56,364 --> 01:21:58,785
So, wait. You're in high school?

1222
01:21:58,892 --> 01:22:02,153
Yeah. I just came here to visit
for the weekend, like you guys.

1223
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:06,409
- But you even drink like a college girl.
- Really? Thanks.

1224
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:13,509
- So I guess this is it, huh?
- Well, it doesn't have to be.

1225
01:22:15,947 --> 01:22:17,191
Carter!

1226
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,529
Spank me, tiger! Yeah!

1227
01:22:29,228 --> 01:22:32,261
- I guess I better...
- Morris.

1228
01:22:35,563 --> 01:22:38,378
Think you're gonna go here next year?

1229
01:22:38,476 --> 01:22:41,575
After this weekend,
I kind of feel like I already do.

1230
01:22:41,675 --> 01:22:44,971
Plus, I already have
a girlfriend lined up, so...

1231
01:22:45,067 --> 01:22:46,955
Yeah? And who's that?

1232
01:22:48,907 --> 01:22:52,355
Someone I met.
She plays a mean game of quarters.

1233
01:22:53,899 --> 01:22:58,122
So I guess that means I'll be getting
my photography lessons after all.

1234
01:23:17,484 --> 01:23:20,746
- So that's everything.
- I guess we should get on the road.

1235
01:23:20,843 --> 01:23:22,949
Wait. You know what? Hang on.

1236
01:23:32,043 --> 01:23:34,214
All right, guys. Let's go home.

1237
01:23:47,403 --> 01:23:49,192
Here comes trouble.

1238
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:52,870
- Hey, Kevin.
- Hey, Gina.

1239
01:23:52,971 --> 01:23:55,208
So I got your video message.

1240
01:23:55,755 --> 01:23:57,697
Looks like you guys
had a pretty crazy weekend.

1241
01:23:57,804 --> 01:23:59,080
Hell, yeah!

1242
01:24:01,003 --> 01:24:02,694
- Yeah!
- Breath mint.

1243
01:24:04,972 --> 01:24:10,154
Anyway, well,
it kind of made me think a lot

1244
01:24:10,251 --> 01:24:13,961
about you and me and, you know, us.

1245
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:18,026
Why don't we just forget
this whole break-up thing ever happened?

1246
01:24:18,123 --> 01:24:19,650
What do you say?

1247
01:24:21,355 --> 01:24:22,599
Well...

1248
01:24:25,771 --> 01:24:26,916
You know,

1249
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:30,308
I don't think so.

1250
01:24:32,204 --> 01:24:35,237
- What?
- Yeah, you see, I've moved on.

1251
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:41,060
Moved on? We've only been
broken up for, like, three days.

1252
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:43,945
Yeah, well, a lot can happen in three days.

1253
01:24:44,332 --> 01:24:50,245
And, Gina, that guy you saw?
Yeah, that's not really me.

1254
01:24:51,404 --> 01:24:53,640
Well, see you around.

1255
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,806
And get a boob job, Gina. Lift.

1256
01:24:58,476 --> 01:25:02,120
Kevin! Wait! Seriously!

1257
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:09,383
So what do you guys
want to do next weekend?

1258
01:25:09,483 --> 01:25:12,353
Next weekend? Aren't you grounded for,
like, the next six months?

1259
01:25:12,459 --> 01:25:15,307
Fuck that! No problem.
I can just sneak out.

1260
01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:20,288
You know,
I've got a cousin that goes to U of I.

1261
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:38,433
I'll pay you $5 a sniff,
either one of your farts.

1262
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,052
I just want to cherish
your gaseous fumes.

1263
01:25:42,155 --> 01:25:44,010
It can be a birthday present.
My birthday's coming up!

1264
01:25:44,395 --> 01:25:46,086
Yeah! Lost my shoe.

1265
01:25:48,748 --> 01:25:50,570
Dude, you gotta see the shots I got
from last night's game.

1266
01:25:50,668 --> 01:25:53,002
I got one where Stoloff is mid-air
right over the inset...

1267
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,718
Insectercide? Whatever the hell...
What the...

1268
01:25:57,675 --> 01:26:01,287
Dean Chandler has denied our petition,
and we're still on probation.

1269
01:26:01,388 --> 01:26:02,849
- Shit.
- Yeah.

1270
01:26:02,987 --> 01:26:04,231
<i>Okay, cut!</i>

1271
01:26:06,571 --> 01:26:09,954
Our camping trips? Our... The school...

1272
01:26:10,059 --> 01:26:12,132
Thing that was awesome
that we did together. Remember that?

1273
01:26:12,235 --> 01:26:14,602
It was you and me. What's the line?

1274
01:26:16,811 --> 01:26:20,127
Looks like my years of hard work
have finally paid off!

1275
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:22,827
What's the matter, Morris?

1276
01:26:22,923 --> 01:26:25,192
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1277
01:26:25,292 --> 01:26:28,805
I've taken some whip-its, you know,
the cracker shit.

1278
01:26:32,556 --> 01:26:34,727
Whatever, man.
You guys are lightweights. I don't feel shit.

1279
01:26:34,827 --> 01:26:39,050
- Mom's a lightweight.
- Here... Fuck you, dude!

1280
01:26:40,523 --> 01:26:42,531
Well, it doesn't have to be.

1281
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:48,487
Is that our stuff?

1282
01:26:48,587 --> 01:26:51,304
Yeah. They even threw all our rubbers in.

1283
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:54,441
Those scrotum-eating baby rapers.

1284
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,761
Those taint-sucking ball junkies.

1285
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,507
Those jizz-guzzling monkey fuckers.

1286
01:27:11,372 --> 01:27:13,827
You sucked in <i>Austin Powers.</i>
Mike Myers carried you.

1287
01:27:13,931 --> 01:27:15,841
You didn't even say nothing, bitch.

1288
01:27:15,947 --> 01:27:18,435
Dude, you're doing it wrong, anyway.
You gotta flip it, bitch.

1289
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:19,946
Fucking beat you...

1290
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:25,610
Dude, this is so much better
than the brochure.

1291
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,431
I know, man.
I've got a good feeling about this.

1292
01:27:27,532 --> 01:27:31,722
- I'm sorry, K.B. just said he had a boner.
- He said he had a boner.

1293
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:33,096
<i>Can we cut? Cut.</i>

1294
01:27:33,644 --> 01:27:35,651
I've got to ask you a favor.

1295
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:38,050
You know that book about the mice

1296
01:27:38,155 --> 01:27:41,188
that Miss Dangle is asking
everybody to read?

1297
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:43,779
- That's way too much cereal.
- Swallow.

1298
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:48,000
Twin powers, activate!

1299
01:27:49,195 --> 01:27:53,287
Form of a screaming...
Screaming manimal!

1300
01:27:57,419 --> 01:28:01,314
<i>Bearcat's gay and he wants to do me</i>

1301
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:06,437
<i>I'm gonna punch his face</i>
<i>And then he'll sue me</i>

1302
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:11,369
<i>I'm going home with
pussy on my pee-pee</i>

1303
01:28:12,523 --> 01:28:19,015
<i>Gonna tell my friends</i>
<i>That college is the shitty, yeah</i>

1304
01:28:20,492 --> 01:28:21,866
<i>Eat that shit</i>

1305
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,141
And cut!

1306
01:29:25,382 --> 01:29:26,382
