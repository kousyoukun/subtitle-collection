1
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,331
他对妻子说：
"你说换尿布是什么意思？
He said to his wife, "What do you mean change the baby?

2
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,301
我是个球员那不是我的工作"
I'm a ball player. That's not my line of work."

3
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:37,671
她转过身来，双手叉腰
表达了她的想法
And she turned around with her hands on her hips and she communicated.

4
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,940
她说："听着，伙计，
She said, "Look, Buster,

5
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:41,842
你把尿布像钻石一样展开
you lay the diaper out like a diamond.

6
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,944
把二垒放在本垒上
You put second base on home plate.

7
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,147
把宝宝的屁股放在投手丘上
Put the baby's bottom on the pitcher's mound.

8
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:48,882
连接一垒和三垒，从下面滑回本垒
Hook up first and third, slide home underneath.

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,719
如果开始下雨，比赛也不会取消
And if it starts to rain, the game ain't called.

10
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,521
你就得重新开始"
You start all over again."

11
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,925
所以我要表达我的想法
So I'm going to communicate.

12
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,863
现在，我知道
我们不能一夜之间让事情变好，
Now, I know that we can't make things right overnight,

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,100
但我们会让它变好的
but we will make them right.

14
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:09,103
我们的命运不是注定的，
Our destiny is not our fate.

15
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,905
而是我们的选择
It is our choice.

16
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:16,377
你和你的祖先帮助建立了这个国家
You and your forbears help build this nation.

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,380
现在，帮助我们重建它
Now, help us rebuild it.

18
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,782
非常感谢你们
Thank you very much.

19
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,963
谢谢您，总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

20
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,365
干得好，总统先生
Good job, Mr. President.

21
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,634
"生牛皮"正在移动

22
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:43,471
一切安全

00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,072
进行得很顺利，先生
Went great, sir.

24
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,107
嗯，回忆往事的一趟
Boy, a trip down memory lane.

25
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,144
罗伊，几十年没见到他了
他是劳工总会的
Haven't seen him in decades, Roy, with AFL-CIO.

26
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:54,615
哦，他说你们俩曾在好莱坞
与一个叫索雷尔的人斗争过
Oh, he said the two of you fought with a guy in Hollywood, named Sorrell.

27
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,817
索雷尔赫伯·索雷尔
Sorrell. Herb Sorrell.

28
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,119
是的，他为苏联人工作，
Yes, he was working for the Soviets,

29
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,889
试图通过工会渗透好莱坞
trying to infiltrate Hollywood through the unions.

30
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,459
罗伊和我以后都叫他"气坏了"
Roy and I used to call him,"sore-as-hell" after that.

31
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,428
日程上接下来是什么？
What's next on the agenda?

32
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,099
"生牛皮"正从南出口出来
Rawhide coming through the south exit.

33
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,434
准备直升机...
Prepare the chopper...

34
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,639
我母亲常说，
My mother used to say,

35
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,875
"生活中发生的一切都有原因，
"Everything in life happens for a reason,

36
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,745
即使是最令人沮丧的挫折
even the most disheartening setbacks.

37
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,948
到最后，一切，
And in the end, everything,

38
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:31,051
甚至看似随机的命运转折
even seemingly random twists of fate

39
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,854
都是神圣计划的一部分"
is all a part of the divine plan."

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,208
把他带出来！把他带出来！
Get him out! Get him out!

41
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,747
此刻细节非常模糊
Details are very sketchy at this moment.

42
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,850
我们不知道究竟发生了什么
我们不知道事情的顺序
We don't know precisely what happened. We don't know the sequence.

43
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,253
首先，总统是安全的
First of all, the president is safe.

44
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,154
这正如--

00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,789

- 鲍勃·伯科威茨

46
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:09,990
你好，鲍勃？
Hello, Bob?

47
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,996
我会等待后台的人来这里告诉我们
I'll wait for somebody in the back room to come up here and tell us.

48
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,467
我们之前向您报告说总统没有受伤

白宫刚刚在过去几分钟内确认
The White House has confirmed now just in the last few minutes

50
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,205
里根总统确实被枪击了
that President Reagan has indeed been shot.

51
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,741
他没有在交流
He isn't communicating.

52
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,677
- 拉里，我们能问你一个问题吗？
- 拉里，
-  Larry, can we ask you a question? -  Larry,

53
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,845
有任何证据表明刺客
是为苏联工作的吗？
is there any evidence the assassin was working for the Soviets?

54
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,181
- 拉里...  - 我不能说就这样
-  Larry... - I can't say. That's it.

55
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,749
我们已经得到确认...

通过武力夺取了政权

57
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:52,099
任何阻碍革命的人都将被清除

58
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,207
一道铁幕已经降临在这片大陆上
An Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.

59
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:07,748
极权主义政权的种子
在苦难和战争中滋长
The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and war.

60
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:12,185
它们在贫困和冲突的
邪恶一面蔓延和发展
They spread and go on the evil side of poverty and strife.

61
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:16,324
当对更好生活的希望消失时
它们达到全面增长
They reach their full growth when the hope of a better life has died.

62
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,127
我们必须保持那种希望活着！

63
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,730
世界目睹了第一颗原子弹带来的

64
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,332
新程度的毁灭

65
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,099
这种原子力量的展示
This show of atomic force

66
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,068
只是未来事物的警告
is only a warning of things to come.

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,610
苏联通过暴力和恐吓
Soviet Union has by violence and intimidation

68
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,748
侵犯了波兰
乌克兰和捷克斯洛伐克的权利，
bordered the rights of Poland, Ukraine, and Czechoslovakia

69
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,184
把数百万人关在无法逃脱的监狱里
holding millions in a prison unable to escape.

70
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,854
今天世界的焦点集中在柏林，

71
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,689
那里东西方正面对峙

苏联政权试图关闭其在东德的边境，
The Soviet regime looks to close its border

73
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,760
阻止那些逃离

74
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,428
极权主义镇压的人

卡斯特罗对古巴的接管
Castro's takeover of Cuba

76
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,701
为苏联提供了一个基地，

77
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,170
用于针对美国的核威胁
for nuclear aggression aimed at the United States.

78
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,184
现在，是时候让这个国家

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,554
在太空成就方面
发挥明确的领导作用了，
a clearly leading role in space achievement,

80
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:24,425
这在许多方面可能掌握着
我们在地球上未来的关键
which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth.

81
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,563
你还担心他们在监听吗?
Do you still worry they are listening?

82
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,601
他们很久以前就不再听我的了
They stopped listening to me a long time ago.

83
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,638
不是我我正派他来见你
Not me. I'm sending him to see you.

84
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,574
这已经不再是老年人的战斗了
This is no longer a fight for old men.

85
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,944
也许不是
但他是我们最年轻的内阁成员
Perhaps not, but he's our youngest cabinet member

86
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,447
正在被培养成为下一任总统
being groomed to be the next president.

87
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,014
他经验不多,
He has little experience,

88
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,917
但我们有些人相信
他可以成为下一任领导人
but some of us believe he can be the next leader.

89
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:28,188
然而,他需要
从我们的错误中学习
However, he will need to learn from our mistakes.

90
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,090
你是指我的错误吗?

91
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,427
啊,试着把这看作一个机会
Ah, try to look at this as an opportunity

92
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,463
来纠正错误
to make things right.

93
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,466
还有其他人知道他要来见我吗?
Does anyone else know he's coming to see me?

94
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,534
希望没有
Let's hope not.

95
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,546
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello. - Hello.

96
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,181
我来见维克多·彼得罗维奇

谢谢你见我,同志
Thank you for seeing me, Comrade.

100
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,900
"同志"?
"Comrade"?

101
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,469
我们现在已经不怎么用这个词了
We don't use that term much any longer.

102
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,770
是出于尊重
Offered in respect.

103
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,741
对你,以及同样值得尊重的
那个时代

哦
Oh.

那么...
So...

108
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,590
是什么让母亲俄罗斯的
冉冉升起的新星

109
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,792
来拜访一个——一个老间谍呢?
to visit with a-- an old spy?

110
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,430
向你问一个问题
To ask just one question of you.

111
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:47,835
为什么?
Why?

112
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,173
- "为什么"? - 如果我即将重新获得
- "Why"? - If I'm about to regain

113
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,610
我们在这个世界上应有的地位
我必须知道
our rightful place in this world, I must know

114
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,747
为什么我们30年前失败了
why we failed 30 years ago.

115
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,015
为什么我们甚至没有战斗就放弃了?
Why we gave up without even a fight?

116
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:08,856
为什么我们允许自己成为
曾经伟大国家的一个影子?
Why did we allow ourselves to become a mere shadow of our once great nation?

117
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,423
比我更聪明的人...
Wiser men than I...

118
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,761
已经回答过这个问题了
have already answered that.

119
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,629
但我不满意
Not to my satisfaction.

120
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,533
你凭什么认为我更有能力?
What makes you think,I am more capable?

121
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,268
因为你是谁,同志
Because of who you are, Comrade.

122
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,772
你做过什么
What you did.

123
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,775
而且你当时在场
And you were there.

124
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,312
是的,我当时在场
Yes, I was there.

125
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,783
我在那里
I was there.

126
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,467
我的正式职位是分析员
My official title was Analyst

127
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,470
在国家安全委员会，
at the Committee for State Security,

128
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,506
我们心爱的克格勃
our beloved KGB.

129
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,475
但我是一名心理学家
But I was a psychologist

130
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,979
对那些可能成为
我国威胁的人进行分析，
profiling those who could become threats to our nation,

131
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,716
有时甚至提前几十年
sometimes decades away.

132
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,523
嗯，啊
Mm, ah.

133
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,826
有人说，我要为
Some say,I was responsible

134
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,595
苏联的解体负责
for the fall of the Soviet Union.

135
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,864
让我们暂停这个小停滞
Let's rest this little stagnation.

136
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,567
是吗？什么事，同志？
Yes? What is it, Comrade?

137
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,570
那个演员
The actor.

138
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,619
他会赢
He will win.

139
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,555
我多年来一直在警告这个人
I've been warning about this man for many years.

140
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,524
准备一份档案
Prepare a file.

141
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,461
呃...书记同志，
Uh... Comrade Secretary,

142
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,866
我已经准备了几十份这样的文件
I have prepared dozens of these documents.

143
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,537
是的，我很感谢这一点，
Yes, and I appreciate that,

144
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,074
彼得罗维奇同志
Comrade Petrovich.

145
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,277
但去准备另一份
But go prepare another.

146
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,414
当然
Of course.

147
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,994
是的，我当时在那里
Yes, I was there.

148
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,967
当我开始成为分析员时
我们只有一个目标：
When I began as analyst, we had one goal:

149
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,671
将共产主义传播到全球每个角落
spreading communism to every corner of the globe.

150
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,976
有些国家我们用军事力量入侵，
Some countries we invaded with military force,

151
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,979
但我们对美国有特别的计划
but we had special plans for the USA.

152
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,616
我们试图从内部瓦解他们，
We sought to break them down from within,

153
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,953
战略性地渗透他们的社会
strategically infiltrating their society

154
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,923
甚至他们的电影业
even their movie industry.

155
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,766
我的任务是跟踪并
影响他们的关键人物
My assignment was to track and influence their key players

156
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,936
并将他们的工会合并成一个
and to merge their labor unions into one

157
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,004
我们可以控制的工会
which we could control.

158
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,875
但你问的问题是错误的
But it's the wrong question you ask.

159
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,713
历史从来不是关于
何时、何地、为什么、如何
History is never about when, where why, how.

160
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,315
它总是归结为谁
It always comes down to who.

161
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,287
- 准备好了吗？
- 是的，先生，我准备好了
- You ready? - Yes, sir, I'm ready.

162
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,622
好的罗纳德·里根，
All right. Ronald Reagan,

163
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,526
来给我们展示
那好莱坞式的微笑
come give us that Hollywood smile.

164
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,663
而我恰好被分配到
And I just so happened to have been assigned

165
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,131
"十字军战士"
to "The Crusader."

166
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,634
这是我们嘲笑他时用的称呼
That is what we mockingly called him.

167
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,038
它成了我的执念
It became my obsession

168
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,342
要理解表象之下的东西
to understand what was beneath the facade.

169
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:54,782
我学会了永远不要
将任何细节视为不重要而忽略，
And I learned to never leave a detail behind as unimportant,

170
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:55,849
因为...
because...

171
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,986
一切都很重要
it is all important.

172
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,523
结婚后，我们要生几个儿子?
After we get married, how many sons are we gonna have?

173
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,492
嗯，你想要几个?
Well, how many do you want?

174
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,727
嗯，要是能组成
一个完整的队伍就好了
Well, it would be nice to have a full team.

175
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,931
你最喜欢什么运动?
What's your favorite sport?

176
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,265
这就是问题所在
That's the trouble.

177
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,366
足球
Football.

178
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,407
卡!可以印制了!
Cut! And print it!

179
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,243
干得好,罗恩和简
准备拍下一个镜头
Nice work, Ron and Jane. Moving on to the next shot.

180
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,013
嗯,感觉挺自然的
Well, that felt pretty natural.

181
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,614
真的吗?哪部分?
Really? What part?

182
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,949
让我们聚焦那双蓝眼睛
Let's move into those baby blues.

183
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:48,435
♪ 嗯,你想荡在星星上吗? ♪
♪ Mmm, would you like to swing on a star? ♪

184
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,172
♪ 用罐子把月光带回家? ♪
♪ Carry moonbeams home in a jar? ♪

185
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,442
♪ 过得比现在更好? ♪
♪ And be better off than you are? ♪

186
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,079
♪ 还是你宁愿做头驴? ♪
♪ Or would you rather be a mule? ♪

187
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,883
但我们不仅仅是演员
But we're more than actors.

188
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,153
- 我们是标志,是领导者
- 没错
- We're symbols, leaders. - Yes.

189
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,922
我们应该谈论当今重要的问题
We should be speaking to the important issues of the day.

190
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,958
哦,埃迪别说了,行吗?
Oh, Eddie. Give it a rest, will you?

191
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,592
把那些留给编剧吧
Leave that to the writers.

192
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,661
你在这里还是新人,里根
You're still new here, Reagan.

193
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,330
相信我,电影公司控制着
我写的每一个字
Trust me, the studios control every word I write.

194
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,665
上帝保佑我,如果我不写,
And God help me, if I don't write,

195
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,300
或者你不读他们让我们说的台词
or you don't read what they tell us to.

196
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,935
呃,他们在付钱,道尔顿
Uh, they're paying the bills, Dalton.

197
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,503
- 他们应该有发言权 - 没错
- They should have some say. - Yes.

198
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,905
我是说,我们做得很好,不是吗?
I mean, we're doing pretty well, aren't we?

199
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,074
- 我觉得是的
- 你不明白,霍顿
- I think so. - You don't get it, Holden.

200
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,843
我们只是一个系统的传声筒,
All we are is a mouthpiece to a system,

201
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,980
一个社会的传声筒
一个忽视工人的社会
to a society, a society that ignores the working man.

202
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,247
相信我,这种情况不会持续下去
Trust me, it won't last.

203
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,985
那你这话是什么意思,道尔顿?
Well, what do you mean by that, Dalton?

204
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,352
字面意思
Exactly what it says.

205
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,188
亲爱的,来吧我们去跳舞
Honey, come on. Let's go dance.

206
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,290
等一下,亲爱的不,不,真的,
Just a second, honey. No, no, really,

207
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,425
给我解释一下我想知道
explain it to me. I'd like to know.

208
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:49,796
好吧,我们就说这整个美国梦的事
Well, let's just say this whole American Dream thing

209
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,099
并不是对每个人都一样适用
doesn't exactly apply to everyone equally.

210
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,001
而我们中的一些人不会坐视不管
And some of us aren't sitting still for it.

211
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,835
我们正在采取行动
We're doing something about it.

212
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,204
采取什么行动?
Doing what?

213
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,607
道尔顿,也许我们该改天再谈这个
Dalton, maybe we should talk about this some other time.

214
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,011
总有一天，你得选边站
At some point, you're gonna need to pick a side.

215
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,848
嗯，今晚不用
Well, not tonight.

216
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,618
今晚，我唯一要选的是舞伴，
Tonight, the only thing,I'm gonna pick is my dance partner

217
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,887
我要和我美丽的妻子跳舞
and I'm dancing with my beautiful wife.

218
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,157
失陪了，先生们，还有女士
If you'll excuse me, fellas, and lady.

219
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,658
我们一会儿回来
We'll be back.

220
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,965
起初他似乎并不是
我们的主要关注对象
He did not initially appear to be a great concern for us.

221
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,667
他忙着享受蜜月
He was too busy enjoying his honeymoon.

222
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:31,238
更不用说
还有好莱坞的光鲜亮丽
Not to mention, the Hollywood glitz and glamour.

223
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,144
要理解是什么让这个人与众不同，
To understand what made this man unique,

224
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,480
我需要了解他年少时的模样
I needed to understand the boy.

225
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,059
他在美国中部的一个小镇长大
He grew up in a small town in the middle of America.

226
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,929
他父亲给他起了个绰号
His father had a nickname for him.

227
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,431
他们叫他"荷兰人"
They called him "Dutch."

228
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:09,342
他很早就有在人群前讲话的经验，
He had experience speaking to crowds at an early age,

229
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,245
因为他的母亲内莉，
as his mother, Nelle,

230
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,683
鼓励他在教堂里
朗诵诗歌和圣经经文
pushed him to read poetry and Bible verses at their church.

231
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,686
"称为我名下的子民，
"If my people which are called by my name,

232
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,454
若是自卑、祷告，
shall humble themselves and pray,

233
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,092
寻求我的面，转离他们的恶行，
seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,

234
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,395
我必从天上垂听，赦免他们的罪，
then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin,

235
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,430
医治他们的地"
and heal their land."

236
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,698
我们是上帝的子民吗？
Are we God's people?

237
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,633
嗯，只要选择祂，
Well, anybody can be God's people

238
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,468
任何人都可以成为上帝的子民
so long as they choose Him.

239
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,205
你是怎么这么快
就记住这些经文的？
How did you memorize those verses so fast?

240
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,373
我不知道 我只是读了就记住了
I don't know. I just read it and remembered.

241
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,710
这是天赋，荷兰人
你要寻找这些才能，
It's a gift, Dutch. You have to look for those talents

242
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,812
因为上帝对你的生命有计划
because God has a purpose for your life.

243
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,447
只有你能做的事
Something only you can do.

244
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,724
"不幸的是，布伦达小姐
你亲爱的丈夫谢默斯，
"Unfortunately, Miss Brenda, your dear husband, Shamus,

245
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,660
在健力士啤酒厂的大桶里淹死了"
drowned to death in the vat at the Guinness brewery."

246
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,464
"哦，我可怜的谢默斯
请告诉我他走得很快"
"Oh, me poor Shamus, please tell me he went quick."

247
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,832
"不，"老神父说
"No," said the old priest.

248
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,601
"那老家伙起来小便了三次！"
"The old bugger got up three times to pee!"

249
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,807
他的父亲杰克是个
有魅力的讲故事高手，
His father, Jack, was a charismatic storyteller

250
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,577
荷兰人把他奉为偶像
and Dutch idolized him for that.

251
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,283
但他看到这种才能
But he saw that talent drown

252
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,285
淹没在酒瓶底
in the bottom of a bottle.

253
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,187
杰克
Jack.

254
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,022
杰克，快点
Jack, come on.

255
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,423
快点，杰克
Come on, Jack.

256
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,030
你又被解雇了吗？
Did you get fired again?

257
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,931
他们没解雇我我自己辞职的
They didn't fire me. I quit.

258
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,868
- 你辞职了？
- 我有大计划在酝酿，内尔！
- You quit? - I got big things cooking, Nelle!

259
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,203
饶了我吧，杰克！
Spare me, Jack!

260
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,038
我们的房租已经拖欠了
We are already late on rent.

261
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,441
别逼得我们的孩子又要搬家
Do not force our children to move yet again.

262
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,611
唧唧歪歪的！
Blah-blah-blah-blah!

263
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,453
为什么杰克喝那么多威士忌？
Why does Jack drink so much whiskey?

264
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,491
这让他忘记
It makes him forget.

265
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,194
忘记什么？
Forget what?

266
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,864
他曾经想成为的一切
All he wanted to be.

267
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,734
他知道自己永远无法成为的一切
All he knows he never will be.

268
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,206
上帝对他的生命有计划吗？
Does God have a plan for his life?

269
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,075
哦，达奇，当然有
Oh, Dutch, of course He does.

270
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,579
不幸的是，杰克现在有其他计划
Unfortunately, Jack has other plans for now.

271
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,981
嘿
Hey.

272
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,018
打开这个
Open this.

273
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,020
这是我和克利弗牧师送的
It's from me and Reverend Cleaver.

274
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,391
他们称之为...
They call it...

275
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,393
廉价小说
dime-store novel

276
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,263
讲述一个父亲是酒鬼的男孩的故事
about a boy with a drunk for a father.

277
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,166
这个男孩找到了上帝
The boy finds God

278
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,436
然后被选入美国国会
and he is elected to the American Congress.

279
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,772
嗯，你必须12岁，
Well, you have to be 12,

280
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,675
然后经过会员资格和确认课程--
and you go through membership and confirmation class--

281
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,743
我知道，先生，
I know that, sir,

282
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:58,945
但必须现在就做
but it has to be now.

283
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,914
我读了这本书
I read the book

284
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,583
我想成为那个人那样
and I wanna be like that man.

285
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,930
罗纳德·威尔逊·里根，我为你施洗
Ronald Wilson Reagan, I baptize you

286
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,968
奉圣父、圣子和圣灵的名
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

287
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,807
达奇读了这本书
Dutch reads this book.

288
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,476
这本书对他来说是一张路线图，
This book was a roadmap for him

289
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,779
描绘了善战胜恶的世界
of the world where good triumphs over evil.

290
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,114
这本书来，看
This book. Here, look.

291
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,653
俄语版
Russian copy.

292
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,634
但要找到我真正在寻找的东西，
But to find what I was really looking for,

293
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,737
我不得不回到里根当救生员的时候
I had to go back to Reagan, the lifeguard.

294
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:00,607
救命！
Help!

295
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,642
- 救命！ - 有人救救她！
- Help! -  Somebody save her!

296
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,811
- 虽然他后来声称... - 救命！
- Although he would later claim... - Help!

297
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,913
- ...在那些夏天里救了77条生命...
- 救救我！
- ...to have saved 77 lives... - Help me!

298
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,648
- ...但有一个问题是... - 救命！
- ...over those summers... - Help!

299
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,584
- 是否真的... - 救命！
- There was a question as to whether... - Help!

300
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,720
坚持住,坚持住
我来帮你了我来帮你了
Hold on, hold on. I got you. I got you.

301
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,456
...那些都是合法的
...those were all legitimate.

302
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,291
- 你还好吗? - 嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

303
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,026
嗯
Yeah.

304
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,463
快到了
Almost there.

305
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,198
好了
There you go.

306
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,134
他还学到了履行职责
He also learned that performing his duty

307
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,871
并不总是会得到赞扬
would not always result in praise.

308
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,607
你他妈在干什么?我没事
What the hell are you doing? I was fine.

309
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,643
你想让我看起来像个傻瓜吗?
You trying to make me look like a fool?

310
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,944
对不起
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,853
三十六,三十二
Thirty-six, thirty-two.

312
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,988
准备!开始!
Set! Hut!

313
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,859
耶!
Yeah!

314
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,794
练得不错,先生们都过来
Good practice, gentlemen. Bring it all in.

315
00:19:56,763 --> 00:20:00,166
- 在他的大学里...
- 伙计们,我有个坏消息
-  At his university... - Fellas, I got tough news.

316
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,404
...他正在把人们
团结在一起并解决问题
...he was bringing people together and solving problems.

317
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,840
- 嘿,教练! - 下周,对吧?
-  Hey, Coach! -  Next week, right?

318
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,376
教练
Coach.

319
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,177
为什么萨尔和帕尔默
不和我们一起出行?
How come Sal and Palmer aren't traveling with us?

320
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,246
- 他们是有色人种
- 我看得出来谢谢,教练
- They're colored. - I can see that. Thanks, Coach.

321
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,515
酒店不接待他们
Hotel wouldn't take 'em.

322
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,021
进来吧,孩子们
欢迎来到里根酒店
Come on in, boys. Welcome to Hotel Reagan.

323
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,357
楼上有个房间给你们,孩子们
There's a room upstairs for you, boys.

324
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,925
希望你们不介意和达奇一起住
I hope you don't mind sharing with Dutch.

325
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,894
他哥哥说他打呼噜
His brother says he snores.

326
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,029
那边是里根训练餐桌
That there is the Reagan training table.

327
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,097
谢谢您,先生
Thank you, sir.

328
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,333
请进
Come on in.

329
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,503
我就知道你会想办法的,杰克
I knew you'd come through, Jack.

330
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,874
现在是晚上8点,我是达奇·里根
现在播报新闻
It's 8:00 p.m., I'm Dutch Reagan. Here now the news.

331
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,910
新任德国总理阿道夫·希特勒宣称,
The new German Chancellor, Adolf Hitler,

332
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,379
他重建德国的意图是和平的,
declares that his intentions in rebuilding Germany

333
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,616
并将遵守所有国际协议
are peaceful and will comply with all international agreements.

334
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,552
- 正是通过广播... - 是啊,当然是这样
-  And it was radio... - Yeah, sure they are.

335
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,422
...他开始展示自己的才能
...through which he began to show his skills.

336
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:01,193
但我终于追溯到他对共产主义的蔑视
But I finally traced his disdain for communism.

337
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,862
那简直是人间地狱
It's hell on Earth.

338
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,498
人们恐惧、饥饿、分裂
People are frightened, hungry, divided.

339
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:09,869
...回溯到一个我国的异见人士
访问他的教堂时
...back to when a dissident of our country visited his church.

340
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,773
国家掌控和管理一切
甚至最小的细节
State runs and controls everything to the smallest detail.

341
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,744
你的言论,你的行为,甚至你的思想
Your speech, your actions, even your thoughts.

342
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,881
你知道他们首先从我们这里夺走了什么吗？
You know what they took away from us first thing?

343
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:22,915
上帝
God.

344
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:24,917
像这样的教堂
Church like this.

345
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,086
在苏联你找不到这样的教堂
You will not find it in the Soviet Union.

346
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,755
他们关闭了大部分教堂
They closed down most of them.

347
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:32,625
神职人员中，许多人要么死了
要么失踪了
And the clergy, many are dead or disappeared.

348
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,996
美国人应该更多地
了解共产主义者
Americans should know more about the communists

349
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,331
因为它正在来到这里
because it's coming here.

350
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:43,836
自由只需一代人的时间就会消亡
Freedom is only one generation away from extinction.

351
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,510
就这样，
And just like that,

352
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,846
种子被播下了
the seed was planted.

353
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,853
记住，
And remember,

354
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,289
祸从口出
loose lips sink ships.

355
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,257
我是罗纳德·里根
This is Ronald Reagan.

356
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,093
那么下次再见，
So until next time,

357
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,795
再见，
so long,

358
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,130
- 愿上帝保佑美国
- 卡
- and God bless America. -  Cut.

359
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,000
- 里根今天的拍摄结束了
- 对不起？
- That's a wrap on Reagan today. - Excuse me?

360
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,703
哦，华纳先生
大家今天的工作到此结束
Oh, Mr. Warner. That's a wrap, everyone.

361
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,706
老板，我惹麻烦了吗？
Am I in trouble, boss?

362
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,274
我们散步聊聊恭喜你
Let's have a walk. Congratulations.

363
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:25,945
嗯，演员工会副主席？我印象深刻
Vice president of Screen Actors Guild, huh? I'm impressed.

364
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,615
你知道你踩进了一个马蜂窝，对吧？
You know you stepped into a hornet's nest, don't you?

365
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,517
怎么说？
How's that?

366
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:34,821
好莱坞即将爆发另一场战争，
There's about to be another war right here in Hollywood,

367
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,457
一边是共产党，另一边是黑帮
with the commies on one side, the mob on the other.

368
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,059
而你正好夹在中间，孩子
And you're caught right in the middle, son.

369
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,994
好吧，杰克嘿
Okay, Jack. Hey.

370
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,363
让我们把话说清楚，好吗？
Let's get one thing straight, okay?

371
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:46,799
我不会为你破坏工会
I'm not gonna do any union busting for you

372
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,735
仅仅因为我在你的工资单上
just because,I'm on your payroll.

373
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,236
这对我来说是利益冲突
It's a conflict of interest for me.

374
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,805
这不是要瓦解工会
It's not about busting up the unions.

375
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,306
而是这个新团体，这个呃...
But it's this new group, this, uh...

376
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:56,576
是的，影视工会联合会
Yeah, the Conference for the Studio of Unions.

377
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,377
赫伯·索雷尔，他是个共产党
Herb Sorrell, he's a commie.

378
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,548
- 是的
- 他们不仅仅在谈罢工
- Yeah. - They're not just talking strike.

379
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,517
他们在谈接管所有工会
They're talking about taking over all the unions.

380
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:08,721
好吧，如果这是地盘之争
就让他们自己解决吧就这样
Well, if it's a turf war, just let them work it out. That's all.

381
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:10,757
他们不会解决的，他们会打起来，
They're not gonna work it out, they're gonna fight it out,

382
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,525
这就是你要发挥作用的地方
and that's where you come in.

383
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,326
演员是最大的工会
The actors are the biggest union.

384
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,429
如果他们投靠索雷尔
我现在就告诉你,
If they go to Sorrell, I'm telling you right now,

385
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,930
共产党就赢了
the commies win.

386
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,199
- 这在这里是不会发生的- 好吧,听着,
- That ain't happening here. - Well, look,

387
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,835
我不想卷入什么事情中间
I don't feel comfortable getting into the middle of something.

388
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,937
你以为你能永远当主角吗?
Do you think you're gonna be a leading man forever?

389
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,339
你需要面对现实,儿子
You need to face the facts, son.

390
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:30,577
这场战争夺走了你生命中最好的年华
This war took the best years of your life.

391
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,280
你最多还有
什么,五年时间对着镜头微笑,
You got, what, five years of smiling for the camera

392
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,082
直到他们把你送去退休?
until they put you out to pasture?

393
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,618
- 好吧,谢谢你的鼓励,杰克- 或者...
- Well, thanks for the pep talk, Jack. - Or...

394
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,455
你做出改变?
do you make a difference?

395
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,759
真正的改变
A real difference.

396
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:11,584
电影是一个平台
The movies are a platform.

397
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:15,922
我们作为演员,很自豪也很荣幸
能成为其中的一部分
That we, as actors, are proud and privileged to be a part of.

398
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,160
我们是美国电影的面孔和生命力
We are the face and the lifeblood of American movies.

399
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,630
所以我们必须保持警惕,
And so we must be vigilant

400
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,765
让自己意识到其他人
and make ourselves aware of others

401
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,000
可能会试图利用我们的平台,
that may seek to use our platform

402
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,504
利用我们来达到他们自己的目的
to use us for their own purposes.

403

Was it something I said?

411
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,967
我只是好奇
I'm just curious.

412
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,603
你是演员还是政客?
Are you an actor or a politician?

413
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,839
简,不是在这里不是现在拜托
Jane, not here. Not now. Please.

414
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:10,342
如果你在事业上投入的精力
If you put as much work into your career

415
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,378
能像你准备演讲那样多,
as you do making your speeches,

416
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,313
你现在就该拿奥斯卡了
you'd have an Oscar by now.

417
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,015
简...
Jane...

418
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,685
这是SAG这是我们的工会
This is SAG. This is our union.

419
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,987
成为演员工会的副主席
And being Vice President of the Screen Actors Guild

420
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,723
就像是上帝的恩赐我真的觉得
is like a gift from God. I really feel

421
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,025
我可以在这里做一些有意义的事情
like I can do something that matters here.

422
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:31,230
还有比一个有理想的演员
更糟糕的吗?
Is there anything worse than an actor with a cause?

423
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,401
如果你一定要毁掉你的事业
罗尼,
Kill your career if you must, Ronnie,

424
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,837
但请饶了我你那该死的演讲
but spare me your damn speeches.

425
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,140
你是个演员
You are an actor.

426
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,075
- 那是你的工作 - 简，别说了
- That is your job. - Jane, just don't.

427
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,811
- 不是政治！ - 请别说了
- Not politics! - Please don't.

428
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,949
- 不 - 你说"不"是什么意思？
-  No. - What do you mean "no"?

429
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,917
更高的工资，更好的工作条件
Higher wages, better working conditions.

430
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,353
这是我们都想要的
这是我们都在追求的
That's what we all want. That's what we're all going for.

431
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,955
而你想要关掉这一切？
And you wanna shut it all down?

432
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,758
你真正想要的是什么？
What is it that you really want?

433
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,226
一个工会，团结一致
One union, and united.

434
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,228
听着，你不会想与
我们开战的，里根
Look, you don't wanna go to war with us, Reagan.

435
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,200
但没人知道
But what nobody knew

436
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,704
里根是FBI的线人
was that Reagan was an FBI informant.

437
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:46,538
他的代号是T-10，
His codename T-10,

438
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,778
他正在揭露我们在好莱坞
日益增长的影响力
and he was exposing our growing influence in Hollywood.

439
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,445
华纳先生，你能提供
Mr. Warner, can you provide the name

440
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,214
试图渗透你公司的组织
of the leader of the organization

441
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,083
领导人的名字吗？
attempting to infiltrate your studio?

442
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,119
他的名字是索雷尔
His name is Sorrell.

443
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,489
赫伯·索雷尔
Herb Sorrell.

444
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,957
我们不会加入你，赫伯
We're not joining you, Herb.

445
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,135
放下没事的
Put it down. It's okay.

446
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,937
冷静下来冷静下来
Settle down. Settle down.

447
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,338
你不明白，是吗？
You don't get it, do you?

448
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,472
我们拥有这个城市
We own this town.

449
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:21,941
你不拥有我
You don't own me.

450
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,176
你不拥有他们
You don't own them.

451
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,512
你想现在投票吗？来吧
You wanna take a vote right now? Go ahead.

452
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,515
我们来投票吧！看看会发生什么
Let's put it to a vote! See what happens.

453
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,117
看看会发生什么
See what happens.

454
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,100
海登先生，依你看，
Mr. Hayden, in your opinion,

455
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,804
为什么共产党人的努力没有成功？
why weren't the communist's efforts successful?

456
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:55,374
只有一个问题
There was just one problem.

457
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,711
他们遇到了演员工会的董事会，
They ran into the Board of Directors of the Screen Actors Guild,

458
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,612
特别是罗纳德·里根...
in particular, Ronald Reagan...

459
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,216
他是对抗这件事的一人军团
who was a one-man battalion against this thing.

460
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,617
让我们开始工作吧
Let's go to work.

461
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:06,953
好！
Yeah!

462
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,490
作为一个公民，我不希望看到
As a citizen, I would not like to see

463
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,525
任何政党因其意识形态
any political party outlawed

464
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,862
而被取缔
on the basis of its ideology.

465
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,664
民主强大到足以抵御
Democracy is strong enough to stand up for itself

466
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,967
任何意识形态的侵蚀，
against the inroads of any ideology,

467
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,335
无论我们多么不同意它
no matter how much we may disagree with it.

468
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,504
因为我仍然相信,主席先生,
Because I still believe, Mr. Chairman,

469
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,573
民主可以处理这个问题
that democracy can handle it.

470
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:32,979
他封杀了我们
他的信息传达得很巧妙,
He had shut us down. He was clever in his message

471
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:36,015
说成为共产党员没问题,
that it was okay to be communist,

472
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:39,351
但不能同时接受我们的薪水
but not while being paid by us.

473
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,262
卡!大家午休时间到了
And cut! That's lunch, everybody.

474
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,998
- 好的干得不错
- 你也表现得很棒
-  Okay. Nice work. -  You were great too.

475
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:53,933
- 我能请你吃午饭吗?
- 当然可以我有时间
-  Can I buy you lunch? -  Sure. I have time.

476
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,668
- 我们去吃点东西吧
- 亲爱的...
- Let's grab a bite. - Honey...

477
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:59,371
当他妻子的事业蒸蒸日上时...
While his wife's career was skyrocketing...

478
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:00,940
- ...食堂还是我的礼服...- 妈妈!
-  ...commissary or my dress... -  Mama!

479
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,975
...他却被打入冷宫,
...he was reduced to the sidelines

480
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:04,276
他们的婚姻...
and their marriage...

481
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,546
- 也日渐恶化- 妈妈...
- deteriorated. -  Mama...

482
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,853
更让他心碎的是,
And to break more his damaged heart,

483
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,355
他们的第三个孩子克里斯汀,
their third child, Christine,

484
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,925
出生当天就夭折了
died the very day she was born.

485
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,210
我的儿子怎么样?
How's my son?

486
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,414
我失去了一个孩子...
I lost a child...

487
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,252
婚姻,事业
marriage, a career.

488
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,954
你觉得你儿子会怎么样?
How do you think your boy is?

489
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,590
你知道,内尔,
You know, Nelle,

490
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,826
我想我可能错过了
那整个人生目标的事
I think I kinda missed the boat on that whole purpose thing.

491
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,831
也许我就是另一个杰克
Maybe I'm just Jack all over again.

492
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,132
不,达奇
No, Dutch.

493
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,767
你不是你父亲
You're not your father.

494
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,472
要记住
Just remember

495
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:11,443
去倾听那个微小、柔和的声音,
to listen to that small, soft voice,

496
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:14,013
那个你听不到的声音
the one that you can't hear

497
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:17,749
除非你独处
unless you're alone

498
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,619
并保持安静,
and quiet,

499
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,122
全神贯注地倾听
and he has your full attention.

500
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,659
记住你属于谁
Remember whose you are

501
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,030
以及你为谁服务
and whom you serve.

502
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,010
有什么事吗,桑迪?
Yes, Sandy?

503
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,146
你能给一个女演员五分钟时间吗?
Can you give an actress five minutes?

504
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,847
呃...
Uh...

505
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,817
- 当然可以- 戴维斯小姐?
- Of course. - Miss Davis?

506
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,886
你好我是南希·戴维斯
Hello. I'm Nancy Davis.

507
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,521
你好,南希·戴维斯我是罗恩·里根
Hello, Nancy Davis. I'm Ron Reagan.

508
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,023
是的,我知道
Yes, I know.

509
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,892
- 喝杯咖啡怎么样?- 哦,好啊
- How about a cup of coffee? - Oh, sure.

510
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,461
- 请坐- 啊
- Have a seat. - Ah.

511
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,863
恐怕我一直在烦你的秘书
I'm afraid I've been a pest to your secretary.

512
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,833
- 哦
- 但在重要的事情上我会坚持不懈
- Oh. - But I persist when it's important.

513
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,835
- 加奶和糖吗?- 哦,好的,
- Cream, sugar? - Oh, well,

514
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,637
- 当然，呃，黑色的 - 哦！
- sure, uh, black. - Oh!

515
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,509
那么...我能为你做些什么
南希·戴维斯？
Well... how can I help you, Nancy Davis?

516
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,245
嗯，
Well,

517
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:23,015
我被列为一封支持信的签名人
I'm listed as a signer on a letter of support

518
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,251
这封信支持两个共产主义同情者
for two communist sympathizers

519
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,653
但我从未签过任何这样的信
but I never signed any such letter.

520
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,255
还有另一个南希·戴维斯
There's another Nancy Davis.

521
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,090
哦，我明白了
Oh, I see.

522
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,093
好吧，呃，最简单的办法就是改名字
Well, uh, the easiest thing to do, is just change your name.

523
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,761
在好莱坞这种事经常发生
It happens all the time in Hollywood.

524
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,497
哦，不不我不能那样做，不行
Oh, no. No. I cannot do that, no.

525
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,433
我的名字对我来说非常重要
My name is very important to me.

526
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,768
这是...这是我的家族
It's-it's my family.

527
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,403
哦，当然
Oh, of course.

528
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,672
呃，家族很重要
Uh, family's important.

529
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:47,839
是的
Yes.

530
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,575
非常重要
Very important.

531
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,880
那么，呃
我想只剩下一件事要做了，
So, uh, I guess there's only one thing left to do,

532
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:59,051
那就是展开一次彻底
而详细的调查
and that is to launch an exhaustive and a detailed investigation.

533
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,187
嗯，当然，我已经聘请了律师
Well, of course, I've retained an attorney.

534
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,588
哦，不需要那样
Oh, there won't be any need for that.

535
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,256
我们可以在晚餐时解决这个问题
We can knock this out over dinner.

536
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,959
- 对不起？
- 是的，呃，我们可以到时再讨论
- Excuse me? - Yes, uh, we can discuss it then.

537
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:09,428
但我不能迟到我，呃...
But I can't be late. I, uh...

是的，我明早要早早去片场
Yes, I have an early studio call tomorrow morning.

539
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:15,634
哦，好吧，我得查查我的约会簿
Oh, well, I'll have to check my date book.

540
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,604
我只是要...给我一下...

Well... Oh, I think,I can manage it,

544
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,614
但我也要早起

545
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,282
那就这么定了！

549
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,794
再见，戴维斯小姐

550
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,101
好的，鲍比，谢谢
Okay, Bobby, thanks.

551
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:50,836
我明早会处理那件事
I'm gonna take care of that in the morning.

552
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:02,981
- 好吧... - 看来
- Well... - Well, it looks like

553
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,350
我们把这地方都包场了
we've shut the place down.

554
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,285
哈，是的，我们做到了给你
Huh, yes, we did. Here.

555
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,193
哦...
Oh...

556
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,363
谢谢你，约瑟夫呃...
Thank you, Joseph. Uh...

557
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,165
- 戴维斯小姐？ - 是？
- Miss Davis? - Yes?

558
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,033
我明早第一件事就会处理这事
I'm gonna get on this first thing in the morning

559
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,801
我会亲自打所有的电话
and I'll make all the calls myself.

560
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,604
你的名字将从那个名单上移除
Your name will be off that list.

561
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,805
哦，就这么简单？
Oh, just like that?

562
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,507
就这么简单
Just like that.

563
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,176
那么，呃，
So, um,

564
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:34,280
当你不演戏或
担任演员工会主席时，
when-when you're not acting or being SAG president,

565
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:37,349
你-你喜欢怎么打发时间
里根先生？
what-what do you like to do with your time, Mr. Reagan?

566
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,186
嗯，我...我喜欢户外活动
Well, I... I like the outdoors.

567
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,453
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

568
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:43,389
- 我-我打高尔夫 - 嗯
- I-I play golf. - Mm.

569
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,456
还有...
And...

570
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,459
我-我喜欢骑马
I-I love riding horses.

571
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:48,960
是的你骑马吗？
Yes. Do you ride?

572
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,563
- 当然，我骑嗯哼 - 你骑？
- Sure, I do. Mm-hmm. - You do?

573
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,733
嗯，没什么能
比得上与马的关系，对吧？
Well, there's nothing like a relationship with a horse, is there?

574
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,902
它们是美丽的动物
They're beautiful animals.

575
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,003
- 是的 - 嗯哼
- Yeah. - Mm-hmm.

576
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,240
哦！哦！
Ooh! Ooh!

577
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,541
看，就是...
Look, just...

578
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,176
- 我该怎么减速？ - 嗯，只要...
- How do I slow down? - Well, just...

579
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,312
- 哦！好的
- 你做得很好你做得很好
- Ooh! Okay. - You're doing fine. You're doing fine.

580
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,249
哦！哦！
Oh! Oh!

581
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,419
- 你骑马的样子很好看 - 哦，谢谢
- You look good on a horse. - Oh, thank you.

582
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,555
我有个坦白要说
I have a confession to make.

583
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,689
哦，是什么？
Oh, what's that?

584
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,691
我不会骑马
I don't ride horses.

585
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:23,562
- 真的吗？你骗过了我 - 哦！
- Really? You could have fooled me. - Oh!

586
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,664
嗯，这里风景很美
Well, it's beautiful up here.

587
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,333
过来这边
Come on over here.

588
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,736
- 是的，确实很美
- 感觉像是离洛杉矶有一百万英里远
- Yes, it is. - It's like we're a million miles from LA.

589
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,939
是的你知道
事实上我的第一次外景拍摄就在这里
Yes. You know, I did my first location shoot here in fact.

590
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,841
- 真的吗？ - 是的
- Really? - Yes.

591
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,709
我跳上那匹马的背上，
I jumped on the back of that horse,

592
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:41,247
环顾四周，然后说，"哇，我在天堂"
looked around at all this, and said, "Wow, I'm in heaven."

593
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,714
哦！
Oh!

594
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,450
是啊，这里就是天堂
Yeah, it's heaven.

595
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:49,721
你知道，我也有个坦白要说，南希
You know, I have a confession to make of my own, Nancy.

596
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,757
嗯
Mmm.

597
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,125
呃...
Uh...

598
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,627
我是所谓的"有瑕疵的商品"
I'm what you call,"damaged goods."

599
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,130
我离过婚，有孩子
I'm divorced, I got kids.

600
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,266
多年来没有得到一个像样的角色
I haven't had a decent role in years

601
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,634
而且我几乎破产了
and I'm just about broke.

602
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,304
这算是个好的开场白吗？
How's that for a come-on?

603
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,641
我们都是有瑕疵的商品，罗尼
We're all damaged goods, Ronnie.

604
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,414
你接下来打算做什么？我是说...
What's next for you? I mean...

605
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,450
你想从这个生活中得到什么？
what do you want out of this life?

606
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,321
我不知道，我曾经有远大的抱负
I don't know, I used to have big ambitions.

607
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,422
梦想
Dreams.

608
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,791
现在，我...
Now, I...

609
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,428
我不知道
我只想在这个世界上做些好事
I don't know. I just wanna do something good in this world.

610
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,298
产生影响
Make a difference.

611
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,267
我觉得你已经做到了
I think you've done that.

612
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,637
我也想产生影响
I'd like to make a difference too.

613
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,810
但我已经明白了一件事，罗尼
But I have figured something out, Ronnie.

614
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,513
- 什么事？ - 这真的很难
- What's that? - It's really hard

615
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,481
在这个生活中产生影响
to make a difference in this life

616
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,851
当你必须独自一人做的时候
when you have to do it alone.

617
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,309
嗯
Mmm.

618
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,131
你确定你想去吗？
Are you sure you wanna go?

619
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:42,701
你知道
这不完全是奥斯卡级别的东西
You know, this is not exactly,Academy Award stuff.

620
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,636
嗯，你知道我们不喜欢分开，
Well, you know we don't like to be apart,

621
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,638
而且我喜欢看我丈夫工作
and I love to watch my husband work.

622
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,807
我知道，我知道，工作就是工作
I know, I know, work's work.

623
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,911
再见，帕蒂！
Bye, Patti!

624
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,532
里根先生，您的经纪人在电话里
Mr. Reagan, your agent's on the line.

625
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,735
听着，卢
如果我去那里，我的职业生涯就...
Look, Lou, if I go out there, my career, it's...

626
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:18,904
完蛋了
it's dead.

627
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,242
卢，听我说
Lou, listen to me.

628
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,447
我不会去那里的
I'm not going out there.

629
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,517
现在是帕布斯特蓝带啤酒时间！
It is Pabst Blue Ribbon time!

630
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:35,687
- 你要喝什么？

- What'll you have? - I'll have a Pabst Blue Ribbon!

631

- 哦，好的
- I'll take a Pabst, Bonzo! - Oh, yeah.

632
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,861
看来邦佐该睡觉了，各位！
Looks like it's bedtime for Bonzo, folks!

633
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,697
谢谢各位女士们先生们，
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

634
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:48,600

635
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,576
嗯
Mm.

636
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,087
女士们...
Ladies...

637
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,323
你们有多余的烟
do you happen to have an extra smoke

638
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,291
给一个小丑吗？谢谢

639
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,437
- 谢谢 - 没问题
- Thanks. - No problem.

640
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:10,081
这个季节
我要给所有朋友送切斯特菲尔德香烟
This season, I'm sending all my friends Chesterfields.

641
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,419
与此同时，他作为电影明星的事业
Meanwhile, his career as movie star

642
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,053
继续衰落
continued to fade.

643
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,322
哇！我应该喝V8的！
Wow! I could've had a V8!

644
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:19,691
哦，罗尼！
Oh, Ronnie!

645
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,627
那是一次超级顺滑的剃须
That's a super smooth shave.

646
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,562
那是因为我用了吉列
That's because I used Gillette.

647
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,400
用樟脑酚抗菌粉舒缓你的皮肤
Soothe your skin with Campho-Phenique antiseptic powder.

648
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:32,471
在电影院或在家里
亲爱的，它们都是完美的零食
At the movies or at home, honey, they're the perfect snack.

649
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,006
ICEE镇上最冰冷的饮料
ICEE. The coldest drink in town

650
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,075
...以甜蜜低价
...at a sweet, low price.

651
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,377
来吧，科尔曼点燃我的火焰
Come on, Colman's. Light my fire.

652
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:47,218
他继续专注于
他作为演员工会主席的角色
He continued to focus on his role as the president of Screen Actors Guild

653
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,822
实际上他做得相当不错
where he did quite well, actually.

654
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:54,893
但电影机会开始消失
But the movie opportunities started to evaporate.

655
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:57,395
是的,他是一个B级电影明星
这是众所周知的
Yes, he was a B-movie star. This is well-known.

656
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,000
但这与失去我们的祖国有什么关系?
But what does this have to do with losing our Motherland?

657
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,771
共产主义不是祖国
Communism is not the Motherland.

658
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,874
他们才是祖国
They're the Motherland.

659
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:14,212
屠格涅夫、列夫·托尔斯泰、契诃夫
Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Chekhov.

660
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,715
那才是祖国!祖国...
That's the Motherland! The Motherland...

661
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,384
就在这里!
is here!

662
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,090
我不能我必须是...
I can't. I must be...

663
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,901
喂?
Hello?

664
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:38,537
哦,不
Oh, no.

665
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,371
罗尼?
Ronnie?

666
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,279
主啊,感谢你赐予我母亲
Thank you, Lord, for my mother.

667
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,817
请照顾她
Take care of her.

668
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,586
我知道你会的
I know you will.

669
00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:00,626
你忠诚的仆人已经回家了
Your good and faithful servant has come home.

670
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,237
当他为失去母亲而哀悼时,
While he mourned the loss of his mother,

671
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,507
并继续为自己的事业奋斗时,
and continued to struggle with his career,

672
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,342
世界正在超越他
the world was passing him by.

673
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,245
美国和苏联
The United States and Soviet Union

674
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,780
现在面临新的冷战
now face off in a new Cold War.

675
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:23,649
核报复迫在眉睫
Nuclear retaliation looms.

676
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,017
"这些基地的目的
"The purpose of these bases

677
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:30,822
只能是为了提供对西半球的
can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability

678
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,591
核打击能力"
against the western hemisphere."

679
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,292
肯尼迪总统的封锁
President Kennedy's blockade

680
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:37,796
阻止了核武器进入古巴
stops the advance of nuclear weapons into Cuba.

681
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,068
穿越德国的移动已经停止
Movements across,Germany had stopped

682
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,803
因为东德人一夜之间建起了一堵墙,
as the East Germans built a wall overnight,

683
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,672
不仅分隔了国家,
separating not only the country,

684
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,973
还分隔了邻居和家人
but neighbors and family.

685
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:58,149
他成为了一家电器公司
电视节目的主持人
He became host of TV show for appliance company.

686
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:01,452
他周游全国,与工厂工人会面
He toured across the country, meeting factory workers

687
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:02,921
并发表演讲
and giving speeches.

688
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,757
他就像一个没有政党的政治家
He was like politician with no party.

689
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:10,361
所以,他决定将目光投向别处
So, he decided to set his sights on something else.

690
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:16,034
我们他贪婪地阅读
关于共产主义、间谍活动、
Us. He devoured books about communism, espionage,

691
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,169
我们对东欧的接管的书籍,
our takeover of Eastern Europe,

692
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,538
以及柏林墙的修建
and the construction of the Berlin Wall.

693
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,812
你知道我们的床要舒服得多
You know our bed's a lot more comfortable.

694
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:30,348
除非你更喜欢
惠特克·钱伯斯而不是我？
Well, unless you prefer, uh, Whittaker Chambers to me?

695
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,684
哦，你知道那不是真的
Oh, you know that's not true.

696
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:34,920
来床上吧，亲爱的时间不早了
Come to bed, honey. It's late.

697
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:43,762
你知道，他们只有导弹和石油
You know, all they have are missiles and oil.

698
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,232
如果我们让他们花掉他们没有的钱，
If we get them to spend money they don't have,

699
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:48,734
他们就无法维持自己
they can't support themselves.

700
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:50,769
- 苏联人 - 苏联人
- The Soviets. - The Soviets.

701
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,738
我们一直在用错误的方式
处理这个问题
We've been going about this all wrong.

702
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:55,440
我们不需要在导弹上与他们一一对应
We don't have to match them missile for missile.

703
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,176
我们所要做的
All we have to do

704
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,411
只是保持压力
is just keep up the pressure.

705
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:02,881
我们的口袋比他们深
We have deeper pockets than they do.

706
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,884
我还以为我嫁给了一个演员呢
And here I thought,I married an actor.

707
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,855
嗯，你可以随时和迪克·尼克松谈谈，
Well, you could always talk to Dick Nixon,

708
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:13,625
或者肯尼迪总统
或者你的任何政治朋友
President Kennedy, or any of your political friends.

709
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:18,196
但为什么我的丈夫似乎总能
But why is it that my husband seems to know

710
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,099
比他们更早知道将要发生什么呢，嗯？
what's gonna happen before they do, hmm?

711
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,203
- 嗯... - 是啊
- Well... - Yeah.

712
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,907
我曾是河边公共游泳池的救生员
I was a lifeguard at a public swimming hole on a river.

713
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:31,743
我研究那条河
And I studied that river.

714
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,747
我学会了如何解读水流
And I learned how to read the currents.

715
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:40,585
不仅是表面的水流
Not just the ones on the surface.

716
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:43,655
还有深藏在水下的暗流，
But also the ones that were deep underneath the water,

717
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,557
在水底深处流动
flowing way under.

718
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:50,662
我在这方面变得很擅长
And I got good at it.

719
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,809
我能在人们意识到之前
察觉到他们有麻烦了
I knew people were in trouble before they did.

720
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:18,156
穆恩，谢谢你这么快
就把你弟弟带到这里来
Moon, thank you for bringing your brother up here on such short notice.

721
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,358
这不容易，他不喜欢飞行
It wasn't easy, he's not a fan of flying.

722
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,128
好吧，我们会改善这一点的谢谢你来，里根先生
Well, we'll remedy that. Thank you for coming, Mr. Reagan.

723
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,963
谢谢你邀请我，塔特尔先生
Thanks for having me, Mr. Tuttle.

724
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,265
现在，我们听说你跨越了政治鸿沟
Now, we understand that you jumped the aisle

725
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,134
- 换了政党 - 嗯，
- and switched parties. - Well,

726
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:32,537
我和我哥哥都是在罗斯福时代成长的
my brother and I both, we came of age under FDR.

727
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,639
我们的父亲杰克是他的狂热粉丝，
Our dad, Jack, he was a huge fan,

728
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:38,276
我们也以新政民主党人的身份为荣
and we were proud to be New Deal Democrats.

729
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,945
那你为什么离开他们？
So why did you leave 'em?

730
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:41,312
我没有离开
I didn't.

731
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:43,381
是他们离开了我
They left me.

732
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,550
那么,你对为戈德华特竞选
有什么看法?
Well, how do you feel about campaigning for Goldwater?

733
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,052
他11月肯定会惨败
He's gonna get shellacked in November.

734
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,187
他不可能入主白宫
No way he takes the White House.

735
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,623
塔特尔先生说得对
他无法击败林登·约翰逊
Mr. Tuttle's right, he can't beat LBJ.

736
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:54,525
我很好奇,罗恩
I'm curious, Ron.

737
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,862
你认为我们这个时代的
主要问题是什么?
What would you say is the issue of our time?

738
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,198
毫无疑问
No question about it.

739
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,367
共产主义和苏联
Communism and the Soviet Union.

740
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,636
我更好奇国内问题
Domestic issues is what I'm more curious about.

741
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:11,709
还有什么比生存更关乎
国内的问题吗,塔特尔先生?
What's more domestic than survival, Mr. Tuttle?

742
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:14,746
共产主义是自由的天敌
Communism is the natural enemy of freedom.

743
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,483
它不会停止从外部或内部攻击我们
It won't stop attacking us from the outside or the inside.

744
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:21,219
它正在世界各地蔓延,而我们却在
And it's spreading around the world while we wring our hands

745
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,888
试图谈判时束手无策
trying to negotiate.

746
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,895
我跟你们说什么来着,伙计们?
他不只是个花瓶
What did I tell you, guys? He's not just a pretty face.

747
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,263
罗恩,你为什么不用行动
来证明你的观点呢?
Why don't you put your money where your mouth is, Ron?

748
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:36,067
参与进来支持戈德华特,然后参选
Get in the game. Support Goldwater and then run for office.

749
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:37,869
嗯,他肯定能以压倒性优势
当选州参议员
Well, he'd win State Senator in a landslide.

750
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:39,905
州参议员听起来怎么样?
State Senator. How does that sound?

751
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:43,875
嗯,
Well,

752
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,377
我曾经扮演过参议员
I played a senator once.

753
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,248
但我从未扮演过州长
But I've never played a governor.

754
00:45:56,988 --> 00:46:01,059
在我开始关注他十七年后,
Seventeen years after,I had begun following him,

755
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:05,030
他在美国政治舞台上首次亮相
he made his debut on American political stage.

756
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,433
我想告诉你们
其实并不存在左派或右派
Well, I'd like to suggest to you, there is no such thing as left or right.

757
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,635
只有向上或向下
There's only up or down.

758
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,370
- 看,那是爸爸
- 我认为我们面临的问题
- Look, there's daddy. -  I believe that the issues

759
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,405
跨越了党派界限
confronting us cross party lines.

760
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,474
现在,这场竞选的一方
Now, one side of this campaign

761
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,077
一直在告诉我们,这次选举的问题
has been telling us that the issues of this election

762
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,646
是维持和平与繁荣
are the maintenance of peace and prosperity.

763
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,649
他们用的说辞是:
The line has been used.

764
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,717
"我们从未如此富足"
"We've never had it so good."

765
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:30,321
某种程度上,这是一种扭曲
Somewhere, a perversion has taken place.

766
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,391
难道摩西应该告诉以色列的子民
Should Moses have told the children of Israel to live

767
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,093
继续在法老统治下做奴隶吗?
in slavery under the pharaohs?

768
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,228
难道基督应该拒绝十字架吗?
Should Christ have refused the cross?

769
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:39,230
难道爱国者们应该放下枪支,
Should the patriots have thrown down their guns

770
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:42,067
拒绝发出那响彻世界的一枪吗?
and refused to fire the shot heard around the world?

771
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,470
你我都有勇气
You and I have the courage

772
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,805
对我们的敌人说...
to say to our enemies...

773
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:50,308
我们不会付出某些代价
there is a price we will not pay.

774
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:56,214
有一个界限他们不能跨越
A point beyond which they must not advance.

775
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,917
我们会为我们的孩子保存这个，
We'll preserve for our children this,

776
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:01,619
人类在地球上最后最好的希望，
the last best hope of man on Earth,

777
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:04,990
否则我们将判处他们迈出最后一步
or we'll sentence them to take the last step

778
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,692
进入千年的黑暗
into a thousand years of darkness.

779
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,196
当世界上伟大的力量在移动时，
When great forces are on the move in the world,

780
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:16,534
我们意识到我们是精神，而不是动物
we learn that we are spirits, not animals.

781
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,537
在时间和空间中，
There's something going on in time and space,

782
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,506
超越时间和空间，
beyond time and space,

783
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,474
无论我们喜欢与否，
which, whether we like it or not,

784
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:25,276
都意味着责任
spells duty.

785
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:27,045
你和我...
You and I...

786
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:30,615
与命运有一场约会
have a rendezvous with destiny.

787
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,056
戈德华特先生败得很惨
Mr. Goldwater lost decisively.

788
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,859
但十字军战士已经到来
But The Crusader had arrived.

789
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:46,898
他正在警告我们
他不怕与我们对抗
And he was putting us on notice that he was not afraid to take us on.

790
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:57,808
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello. - Hello.

791
00:47:57,943 --> 00:47:59,877
哦，嗨！是你啊！
Oh, hi! It's you!

792
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,680
- 嗯，是的
- 你在这里做什么？
-  Well, yes. - What are doing you here?

793
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,349
我...我赢得了什么吗？
I-- Did I win something?

794
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,751
不是我们正在走访这个社区，
No. We're canvasing the neighborhood,

795
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,754
我正在竞选州长
我想请你投我一票
and I'm running for governor and I would like your vote.

796
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,757
哦，当然！当然！我...
Well, of course! Of course! I...

797
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:15,860
现在我觉得很尴尬
我忘了你的名字
Now I'm embarrassed. I forgot your name.

798
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:18,863
他的首字母能帮上忙吗？RR？
Do his initials help? RR?

799
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:24,535
亲爱的！罗伊·罗杰斯来了！
Honey! Roy Rogers is here!

800
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,839
而且他在竞选州长！
And he's running for governor!

801
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,891
他现在已经站在美国的舞台上了
He was on the US stage now.

802
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:51,529
但我的同事们仍然拒绝
认真对待他
But my colleagues still refused to take him seriously.

803
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:53,698
毕竟，他们说，
After all, they said,

804
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,968
"一个州长能对我们做什么呢？"
"What could state governor do to us?"

805
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,971
里根！里根！
Reagan! Reagan!

806
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:05,310
警察负担过重他们太多了
The police are overburdened. There's just too many of them.

807
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,112
这些孩子的父母在哪里？
Where are these kids' parents?

808
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:09,280
嗯，他们不全是学生
大多是煽动者
Well, they're not all students. Mostly agitators.

809
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:10,915
他们甚至不知道自己在抗议什么
They don't even know what they're protesting.

810
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:12,717
他们只是为了抗议而抗议，
They're just doing it to do it,

811
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,219
而且他们得到了外部帮助
and they're getting outside help.

812
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:15,653
他们提出了一系列新的要求
They've issued a new set of demands.

813
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,288
他们当然会这样做
Of course they have.

814
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:19,657
他们希望你亲自向他们展示
They want you to present them to them personally.

815
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,428
国民警卫队已经待命
The National Guard... is on standby.

816
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,130
他们可以在一小时内到达现场
They can be on-site within an hour.

817
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:27,832
那就是联邦介入了会有影响的
That's going federal. Ramifications for that.

818
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,968
社区、学校，尤其是媒体
Communities, schools, especially the press.

819
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:33,638
如果他们想谈,
If they wanna talk,

820
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:36,441
那就去谈吧
let's go talk.

821
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,354
爱情万岁！
Love rules!

822
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,657
里根州长！要爱不要战！
Governor Reagan! Make love, not war!

823
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,993
看他现在的样子，两样都做不到
From the looks of him, he can't do either right now.

824
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,962
比尔会在里面跟我们会合
Bill's gonna meet us inside.

825
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,165
带路吧
Lead the way.

826
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:03,368
现在要和平！现在要和平！
Peace now! Peace now!

827
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,604
我们想听你公开向加州人民讲话！
We want to hear you speak openly about this to the state of California!

828
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,639
你认为我来这里是在干什么？
Well, what do you think,I'm doing here?

829
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:11,809
如果你能出面反对警察升级行动
他们可能会听
If you would come out against the police escalation, they might listen.

830
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,446
你什么时候在你的学生面前站出来
When did you ever stand up in front of your students

831
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,148
恳求他们不要这样做？
and beg them not to do this?

832
00:50:17,282 --> 00:50:20,851
他们告诉你，如果你继续进行这项建设，
They told you that they were going to destroy the university

833
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:23,288
他们就会摧毁大学
if you sought to go ahead with this construction.

834
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:26,391
- 但他们提出要谈判！ - 谈判什么？
- But they offered to negotiate! - Negotiate what?

835
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,626
教授，这一切发生的时候，
All of this happened, professor, the very first time

836
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,628
你们这些年纪大到应该懂事的人
that some of you who are old enough to know better

837
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,165
第一次让学生们认为他们有权选择
let students think that they have the right to choose

838
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:36,134
遵守哪些法律，
which laws they were gonna obey,

839
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:39,003
只要是以社会抗议的名义进行的
as long as it was done in the name of social protest.

840
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:40,705
我受够了
I've had enough.

841
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,909
我要调动国民警卫队
I'm calling in the National Guard.

842
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,062
嘘！
Shh!

843
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:14,572
抗议者对他施加了很大压力，
The protestors pushed him hard,

844
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,341
但他反击得更猛烈
but he pushed them harder.

845
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,777
他是个有争议的州长，
He was controversial governor,

846
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,779
但能做的事情有限
but limited in what he could accomplish.

847
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,883
至少在他最关心的事情上是这样
比如我们
At least, as far as the things he cared most about, like us.

848
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:30,421
他激怒了许多同情我们事业的人，
He enraged many sympathetic to our cause,

849
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:33,358
但他也激励了许多狂热分子，
but he also inspired many fanatics

850
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:34,892
他们会不惜一切代价
who would go to great lengths

851
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:37,928
去一睹他们英雄的风采
to get a glimpse of their hero.

852
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,799
罗恩，这是谁？
Ron, who's this?

853
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,034
年轻人，呃...
Young man, uh...

854
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,036
你为什么在我的院子里？
why are you in my yard?

855
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:48,973
嘿，夫人！
Hey, Mrs. Gov!

856
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,209
我，呃，我是达娜
I'm, uh, I'm Dana.

857
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,411
我是青年支持里根组织的主笔
I'm the head writer for Youth for Reagan.

858
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:55,446
他们要关闭我们
我只想和州长谈五分钟
And they're shutting us down. I just want five minutes with the Gov.

859
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,781
哦，天哪
Oh, for heaven's sake.

860
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,983
我-我会很尊重的，童子军的荣誉
I-I'll be respectful, scouts honor.

861
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,452
我-我不会说脏话或扔东西
I-I won't swear or throw anything.

862
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:04,054
- 我也不会烧建筑物
- 不，问题是，
- And I don't burn buildings. -  No, the problem is,

863
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:06,624
州长的日程安排得很紧
is that the governor is on a very tight schedule

864
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:08,959
他不会给你五分钟
and he won't give you five minutes.

865
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:11,296
- 他会给你一个小时- 太棒了！
- He'll give you an hour. - Sweet!

866
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,464
不，这一点也不棒你需要回家
No, it's not sweet. You need to go home.

867
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,301
请给办公室打个电话
我会确保你得到一个预约，好吗？
Please, just call the office and I'll make sure you get an appointment, okay?

868
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:18,769
- 亲爱的？一切都还好吗？
- 嘿，州长！
- Honey? Is everything all right? - Hey, Gov!

869
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:21,306
这些年轻人在我们院子里过夜
These young people spent the night in our yard.

870
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:23,107
我只想谈谈五分钟
I just wanna talk. Five minutes.

871
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,479
你看起来很累要来杯咖啡吗？
You look tired. How about a cup of coffee?

872
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,915
- 哦- 当然，伙计！
- Oh. - Hell, yeah, dude!

873
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,785
谢谢对不起，我是说，州长
Thank you. I'm sorry, I mean, Governor.

874
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,760
于是这个政客说
"我做了什么要遭受这种待遇？"
So the politician says, "What did I do to deserve this?"

875
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,430
圣彼得说
"嗯，我们不知道该怎么安置你，
Saint Peter said, "Well, we didn't know what to do with you,

876
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:47,798
因为你是我们这里第一个政客"
because you're the first politician we've had up here."

877
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:52,437
内尔已经离开十年了，
Nelle had been gone for a decade,

878
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:54,672
但十字军战士设法找到了其他人
but The Crusader managed to find others

879
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,408
他们也持有她的原教旨主义信仰
who shared her fundamentalist beliefs.

880
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,977
有一天晚上，我们的监视发现了
And one evening, our surveillance picked up

881
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:02,913
我听过的最奇怪的对话之一...
one of the strangest exchanges,I ever heard...

882
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,015
...涉及一个流行歌星，
...involving a pop star,

883
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,784
一个传教士，
a preacher,

884
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,153
和一个预言
and a prophecy.

885
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,822
如果你继续在我面前正直行走，
If you continue to walk uprightly before me,

886
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:15,793
你将住在宾夕法尼亚大道1600号
you will dwell at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

887
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:19,897
阿门
Amen.

888
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,037
好吧，那真是有趣
Well, that was something.

889
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,342
好了，我们该走了
All right, well, we should probably head out.

890
00:53:31,476 --> 00:53:32,743
- 是的，是的- 谢谢你，州长
- Yes, yes. - Thank you, Governor.

891
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,879
- 谢谢你，帕特- 是的，谢谢你们来
- Thank you, Pat. - Yeah, thanks for coming.

892
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:36,180
好的
Yes.

893
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:40,084
你不可能相信这个
You can't possibly believe this.

894
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,322
我信不信并不重要
Doesn't matter if I believe it.

895
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,524
他相信了吗？
Did he believe it?

896
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,526
谁知道呢？
Who knows?

897
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,945
好了，比尔，就是这里
Well, Bill, there she is.

898
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:44,382
总共688英亩
688 acres in all.

899
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:47,284
听起来差不多够了
他们要价多少？
That sounds about enough. How much they asking?

900
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:51,489
对一个诚实的政治家来说太贵了
Too much for an honest politician.

901
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,892
嗯，没什么比在自己的一片土地上
踩来踩去更好的了
Well, there's nothing like stomping around on your own piece of dirt.

902
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,060
工作和汗水，
Work and sweat,

903
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,762
思考你的下一步行动
think about your next move.

904
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,064
下一步行动
Next move.

905
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:04,301
你知道，不幸的是，他们嘲笑
You know, they taunt, unfortunately.

906
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,270
不会持续太久
Won't last.

907
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:08,439
苏联人，他们会一直存在
The Soviets, they're here to stay.

908
00:55:08,573 --> 00:55:12,343
一个退休的州长
对苏联人无能为力
There's nothing a retired governor can do about The Soviets.

909
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:14,845
嗯，你说得对确实不多
Well, you got a point. Not much.

910
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:17,948
但是一个总统...
But a president...

911
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,652
他可以做一两件事
Now, he can do a thing or two.

912
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:40,137
"所以把那个乘以十亿，再翻倍，
"So multiply that by a billion, double that,

913
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,641
那也只是它实际深度的表面
and that's only the surface of how deep it really is.

914
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:47,011
'它'指的是我对你的爱
'It' being my love for you.

915
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:49,614
我真的比那更爱你
I really love you mucher than that.

916
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,782
ITWWW..."
ITWWW..."

917
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,551
- 在整个广阔的世界里
- 在整个广阔的世界里
- In The Whole Wide World. - In The Whole Wide World.

918
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,454
啊
Aw.

919
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:59,023
让我想起你以前的一部电影
Reminds me of one of your old movies.

920
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:01,459
我应该有一把阳伞和一杯薄荷朱利普鸡尾酒
I should have a parasol and a mint julep.

921
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:04,294
好吧，南希宝贝
我可以划回去给你拿一个
Well, Nancy Pants, I can row back and get you one.

922
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:16,641
比尔认为我应该竞选总统
Bill thinks I should run for president.

923
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:19,677
- 哦，比尔这么认为，是吗？
- 怎么了？
- Oh, Bill thinks so, does he? - What?

924
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,746
- 你觉得我太老了吗？ - 不
- You think I'm too old? - No.

925
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,715
你看起来比实际年龄年轻20岁
You look 20 years younger than you are.

926
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,851
你的头脑还像钉子一样锋利
Your mind is sharp as a tack.

927
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:30,421
嗯，你知道没有你的支持
我做不到这一点
Well, you know I can't do this without your support.

928
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:32,222
你永远都会得到我的支持
You'll always have my support.

929
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:36,527
我知道我不能让你余生只是砍柴
I know I can't just let you chop wood for the rest of your life.

930
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:38,529
为什么不呢？
Why not?

931
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:45,235
实际上，我一直在思考
那个牧师在泳池边说的话
I've actually been thinking about what that preacher said by the pool.

932
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:46,671
你认为他是个怪人
You thought he was a kook.

933
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:47,905
我现在仍这么认为
I still do.

934
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,108
但也许他说得有道理
But maybe he was onto something.

935
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:55,112
你可能真的需要拯救我们
You just may need to save us.

936
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,820
晚上好今晚的对决
Good evening. Tonight's showdown

937
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:05,656
可能是我们见过的最激动人心的大会
might be the most thrilling convention we've ever seen.

938
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:08,192
现任总统和来自
他自己党内的一个强劲挑战者之间
It's a true toss-up between the incumbent president

939
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,696
真是难分高下
and a serious challenger from within his own party.

940
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,798
- 迪克认为如果他能和德鲁谈谈-- - 什么？
- Dick thinks if he can talk to Drew-- - What?

941
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:17,034
迪克认为如果他能和德鲁谈谈
宾夕法尼亚州可能会倾向我们
Dick thinks that if he can talk to Drew, Pennsylvania might go our way.

942
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,870
好吧我听说詹姆斯·贝克
之前已经锁定了宾夕法尼亚州
Okay. I heard James Baker had Pennsylvania on lock before.

943
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,772
- 他说那里还有机会
- 我们失去了俄勒冈州
- He said they're in play. - We lost Oregon.

944
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,107
- 俄勒冈州？ - 没戏了明白吗？
- Oregon? - It's gone. All right?

945
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,309
俄亥俄州、印第安纳州
佛罗里达州，或者宾夕法尼亚州，
Ohio, Indiana, Florida, or Pennsylvania,

946
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,045
- 它们必须向我们倾斜
- 还有人想要福特帽子吗？你呢？
- they'll have to break our way. - Anyone else looking for a Ford hat? How about you?

947
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,715
我觉得你需要换个帽子给你
I think you need to change that hat. Here you go.

948
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,583
哦，这个会很好看我把这个扔掉
Oh, that's gonna look good. I'll get rid of this.

949
00:57:32,717 --> 00:57:34,585
好吧，我们可能需要重新考虑那个策略
Okay, we may need to rethink that strategy.

950
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,320
印第安纳州、佛罗里达州、宾夕法尼亚州
Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania.

951
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,823
我会让施威克和德鲁联系
谈谈宾夕法尼亚州的事
I'll get Schweiker to connect with Drew about Pennsylvania.

952
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,091
- 我会回头处理俄亥俄州
- 好的我负责佛罗里达州，
- I'll circle back to Ohio. - Okay. I will take Florida,

953
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,561
迈克，你去和里奇还有玛丽琳谈谈...
and, Mike, why don't you go talk with Rich and Marilynn...

954
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:44,929
- 玛丽琳好的
- ...关于印第安纳州的事？行吗？
- Marilynn. Okay. - ...about Indiana? Okay?

955
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:46,764
嘿，嘿我们得为吉珀赢一场
Hey, hey. We gotta win one for the Gipper.

956
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:48,733
- 嗯？ - 加油！
- Huh? - Come on!

957
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:51,435
- 一、二、三！为了吉珀！
- 准备，开始...什么？
- One, two, three! For the Gipper! - Ready, go... What?

958
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,938
为了下一任美国总统，
For the next,President of the United States,

959
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:58,676
加利福尼亚州全部167票
投给罗纳德·里根州长！
California casts all 167 for Governor Ronald Reagan!

960
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:04,248
谢谢你，加利福尼亚
Thank you, California.

961
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,284
宾夕法尼亚联邦
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

962
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:10,755
投出93票支持杰拉尔德·福特！
has 93 votes for Gerald Ford!

963
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:16,727
西弗吉尼亚州自豪地宣布
The state of West Virginia proudly presents its vote

964
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:21,165
我们党总统候选人的投票...
on behalf of our party's candidate for the presidency...

965
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:26,470
20票投给杰拉尔德·R·福特
Twenty votes for Gerald R. Ford.

966
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:41,018
没有比政治失败
There is no defeat more bitter

967
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:42,953
更痛苦的失败了，
than a political defeat,

968
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,591
尤其是当你认为这是你最后的机会时
especially if you think it is your last chance.

969
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48,626
而现在，我预测
And right now, I predict

970
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:51,996
美国人民那天晚上会说，
that the American people are going to say that night,

971
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,665
"杰瑞，你做得很好！
"Gerry, you've done a good job!

972
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,500
继续保持下去！"
Keep right on doing it!"

973
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,837
福特偷走了胜利，先生
Ford stole it, sir.

974
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,405
他像给婴儿发糖果一样
He was handing out ambassadorship

975
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,874
随意分发大使职位
和搭乘空军一号的机会
and rides on Air Force One like candy to babies.

976
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:06,310
幕后政治
Backstage politics.

977
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:14,652
我真正想要的，迈克，是成为那个
What I really wanted, Mike, was to be the guy

978
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:17,554
最终对苏联说"不"的人
who finally got to say "nyet" to the Soviets.

979
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:24,028
看来这不是上帝的旨意
Guess it wasn't God's will.

980
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,899
民主党人和共和党人
Democrats and Republicans

981
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,803
30年来对我们形成了统一战线
presented a united front against us for 30 years.

982
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:37,507
但我们感觉到吉米·卡特当选带来了机会
But we sensed an opportunity with the election of Jimmy Carter.

983
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:41,912
然后，在1979年，
Then, in 1979,

984
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,482
我最担心的事情开始成形
my worst fears began to take shape.

985
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,786
这是一场信心危机
It is a crisis of confidence.

986
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:52,957
是的，吉米，这确实是一场信心危机
Yes, Jimmy, it's a crisis of confidence, all right.

987
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,093
你在听这个吗？
Are you listening to this?

988
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,462
我们可以看到这场危机正在消退...
We can see this crisis drawing down...

989
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,598
我们是世界上最伟大的国家
我们只是忘记了这一点
We are the greatest country in the world and we have just forgotten it.

990
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,035
好像我没预见到这一点似的
Like I didn't see this coming.

991
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,472
可以说出来，罗尼
It's okay to say it, Ronnie.

992
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:12,643
好吧我会说的
Okay. I'll say it.

993
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,880
我想再次参选
I want to run again.

994
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,393
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think about that?

995
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,396
如果我能再来一次...
If I can do it all again...

996
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,635
公众的审视，对你品格的攻击，
The public scrutiny, the attacks on your character,

997
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:40,070
所有的谎言
all the lies.

998
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,008
但主要是，
But mainly,

999
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,643
我希望你能快乐
I want you to be happy.

1000
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:52,516
嗯，你已经让我成为
世界上最幸福的人了
Well, you've already made me the happiest man in the world.

1001
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:01,658
我一生都在与别人分享你
I've had to share you my whole life.

1002
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:04,695
但...这就是我签约的内容，
But... that's what,I signed up for,

1003
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,099
也是我爱上的人嗯
and who I fell in love with. Hmm.

1004
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:13,503
对你来说还没结束，罗尼
It's not over for you, Ronnie.

1005
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,941
你知道你必须做什么
You know what you have to do.

1006
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,010
这一次...
And this time...

1007
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:21,378
- 赢得它 - 赢得它
- Win it. - Win it.

1008
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:36,293
不，总统先生，
No, Mr. President,

1009
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:39,396
我们没有两位数的通货膨胀
we don't have double-digit inflation

1010
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,498
并不是因为人民生活得太好
because the people are living too well.

1011
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:46,203
我们有两位数的通货膨胀
是因为政府生活得太好了
We have double-digit inflation because the government is living too well.

1012
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:51,341
我们的首要任务必须始终是世界和平
Our first priority must always be world peace.

1013
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:55,679
使用武力永远是最后的手段
The use of force is always the last resort.

1014
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:58,182
这些是国民医疗保险的一些要素
These are the kind of elements of a national health insurance

1015
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,917
对美国人民来说很重要
important to the American people.

1016
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:04,088
里根州长，再次表现出
他的典型作风，反对这样的提议
Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.

1017
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:08,092
你又来了
There you go again.

1018
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:12,329
下周二，你们都将前往投票站做出决定
Next Tuesday, you will all go to the polls and make a decision.

1019
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,198
当你做出那个决定时，
And when you make that decision,

1020
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,500
我认为你最好问问自己，
I think it would be well to ask yourself,

1021
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,137
你现在的处境比四年前好吗？
are you better off than you were four years ago?

1022
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:24,942
现在在商店购物比四年前更容易吗？
Is it easier to buy things in the store than it was four years ago?

1023
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:29,379
这个国家的失业率
是增加了还是减少了？
Is there more or less unemployment in the country?

1024
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:33,383
美国在世界上是否仍受到尊重？
Is America as respected throughout the world?

1025
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:35,986
你感到安全吗？
Do you feel as safe?

1026
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:41,025
我们是否比四年前更强大？
Are we as strong as we were four years ago?

1027
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,228
如果你的答案是"是的"，
If your answers are "yes,"

1028
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:47,031
那么我想你显然知道该投票给谁
then I think it is obvious who you will vote for.

1029
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,134
但如果你不同意...
But if you don't agree...

1030
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,272
那么我可以建议另一个选择
then may I suggest another choice.

1031
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:59,776
...并将尽我所能
...and will, to the best of my ability.

1032
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,212
维护、保护和捍卫
Preserve, protect and defend.

1033
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,214
维护、保护和捍卫
Preserve, protect and defend.

1034
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:06,216
美利坚合众国宪法
The Constitution of the United States.

1035
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,618
美利坚合众国宪法
The Constitution of the United States.

1036
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:10,888
- 愿上帝保佑你
- 愿上帝保佑我
- So help you God. - So help me God.

1037
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,389
恭喜您，先生
Congratulations, sir.

1038
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:20,064
我们将再次成为自由的典范
We will again be the exemplar of freedom

1039
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:23,767
和那些尚未获得
自由的人的希望灯塔
and the beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.

1040
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:27,571
至于自由的敌人，
As for the enemies of freedom,

1041
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:29,406
他们将被提醒
they will be reminded

1042
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:32,809
和平是美国人民
that peace is the highest aspiration

1043
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:34,879
最崇高的愿望
of the American people.

1044
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:39,416
我们将为此谈判，为此牺牲，
We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it,

1045
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:43,220
但我们绝不会为此投降
but we will not surrender for it.

1046
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:45,622
现在不会，永远也不会
Now or ever.

1047
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:26,696
詹姆斯·贝克在76年
为福特工作时击败了我们，
James Baker whips our butt in '76 working for Ford,

1048
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:29,566
- 现在他是幕僚长了
- 这就是为什么他是幕僚长
- now he's Chief of Staff. - Well, that's why he's Chief of Staff.

1049
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,802
埃德，一个在80%的时间里
与你意见一致的人
Ed, someone who agrees with you,80% of the time

1050
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:35,906
是80%的朋友，而不是20%的敌人
is an 80% friend, not a 20% enemy.

1051
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:37,874
对不起
Excuse me.

1052
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:41,578
- 议长先生 - 总统先生
- Mr. Speaker. - Mr. President.

1053
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,414
恭喜欢迎来到大联盟
Congratulations. Welcome to the Bigs.

1054
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:47,084
今晚好好享受吧
因为明天我们就要开始工作了
Now you enjoy tonight because tomorrow, we go to work.

1055
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,686
嗯，我已经对你有了充分的了解，蒂普
Well, I've been well-briefed on you, Tip.

1056
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,356
我被告知我最好有个不错的开端
I've been told I better get a pretty good head start.

1057
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:55,059
- 啊，你这很爱尔兰- 是的
- Ah, that's very Irish of you. - Yes.

1058
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:58,662
你打算每天打十个回合
这就是我们这里的做事方式
You plan on going ten rounds every day, that's how we do things here.

1059
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:01,865
好吧只要记住，每天都有下午6点
All right. Just remember, every day has a 6:00 p.m.

1060
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:03,400
先生，您这话是什么意思？
What do you mean by that, sir?

1061
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,936
嗯，6点之后，我们就不是政治对手了
Well, after 6:00, we're not political enemies.

1062
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,537
我们只是两个喝啤酒的爱尔兰人
We're just two Irishmen having a beer.

Oh. They're just watching me dance with the prettiest girl in the room.

Ladies and gentlemen, The President of the United States.

1087
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:43,633
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

1088
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:46,603
各位，请坐下
Everybody, just be seated.

1089
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,573
早上好，各位，早上好
Good morning, everyone, good morning.

1090
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:52,309
现在父亲找不到他乐观的小儿子
Now the father can't find his little optimistic son

1091
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:56,480
所以他呼唤他
小男孩从那堆巨大的粪便中冒出头来，
so he calls out to him and the little boy pops out of that huge pile of manure,

1092
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:57,947
说，"是的，爸爸？"
says, "Yes, Dad?"

1093
01:06:58,082 --> 01:07:01,017
父亲说，"你在里面干什么？"
The father says, "What are you doing in there?"

1094
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,320
小男孩说，"嗯，有这么多粪便，
And the little boy says, "Well, with all this manure,

1095
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:06,022
我知道里面肯定有一匹小马"
I know there's gotta be a pony in there somewhere."

1096
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,894
总之，那是我父亲最喜欢的笑话
Anyway, that was my father's favorite joke.

1097
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:15,165
女士们先生们，我们自己也有一匹小马，
And, ladies and gentlemen, we have a pony ourselves,

1098
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:17,301
那就是美国人民，
and it's the American people,

1099
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:20,470
我们会尽我们所能
为他们做一切
and we're gonna do everything for them that we can.

1100
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:23,073
我们只需要把他们挖出来嗯
We just have to dig 'em out. Mm.

1101
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:28,878
他还没当上总统半个小时，
He wasn't President for one half-hour

1102
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:31,381
伊朗就释放了被扣押了一年半的
before Iran released the American hostages

1103
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,717
美国人质
they had been holding for a year and a half.

1104
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:37,354
正如他的支持者所说，
It was morning in America,

1105
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:40,056
这是美国的黎明
as his supporters would say.

1106
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:42,726
但仅仅几天之后，
But in just a few days,

1107
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:48,365
这个黎明就几乎像来时一样迅速消失了
that morning nearly disappears as quickly as it had come.

1108
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:55,172
你们和你们的先辈建立了我们的国家，
You and your forbears built our nation,

1109
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,574
现在请帮助我们重建它
now help us rebuild it.

1110
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,209
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1111
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,357
不，我喜欢更亮一些哦，还有黄色，
No, I like it brighter. Oh, and the yellow,

1112
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,393
- 你知道，罗尼喜欢--
- 酒店发生了枪击事件
- you know, Ronnie loves-- - There's been a shooting at the hotel.

1113
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,195
- 什么？ - 没事的，夫人
- What? - It's all right, ma'am.

1114
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,596
您的丈夫没有中弹
Your husband wasn't hit.

1115
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:20,964
带我去那里
Get me there.

1116
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,366
夫人，我不能这么做
Ma'am, I can't do that.

1117
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:24,067
现在就带我去，否则我自己走过去
Get me there now or I'm walking.

1118
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,052
有点呼吸困难
A little hard to breath.

1119
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,497
就在他的胳膊下面
Right here under his arm.

1120
01:08:57,401 --> 01:08:58,602
你告诉我他没有中弹
You told me he wasn't hit.

1121
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:00,437
- 不，他中弹了
- 他中弹的位置在哪里？
- No, he was. - Where was he hit?

1122
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,971
我不知道他们正在寻找子弹
I don't know. They're looking for the bullet.

1123
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:03,607
- 什么？ - 吉姆·布雷迪头部中弹了
- What? - And Jim Brady was shot in the head.

1124
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,142
里根女士，对不起
任何人都不允许进去
Miss Reagan, I'm sorry, no one's permitted back there.

1125
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:08,778
- 你不会想看到他--
- 他必须知道我在这里
- You don't wanna see him-- - He has to know I'm here.

1126
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:12,482
- 好吧
- 是的对不起，让一下！
- Yeah, okay. - Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me!

1127
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,485
我们又给他输了300毫升
We've given him another 300 cc.

1128
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:17,120
他已经失去了三分之一的血液
He's lost a third of his blood already.

1129
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:19,289
好的准备手术
Okay. Get him prepped.

1130
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:22,259
南希在哪里？
Where-- where's Nancy?

1131
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:25,929
-  罗尼？ - 哦，嗨，亲爱的
-  Ronnie? - Oh, hey, honey.

1132
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:28,465
- 我忘记躲开了 - 哦，亲爱的...
- I forgot to duck. - Oh, honey...

1133
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,035
尽量不要说话
Try not to talk.

1134
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:35,839
- 对不起对不起 - 你会没事的
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You're gonna be okay.

1135
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:40,277
- 你会没事的 - 我很好
- You're gonna be okay. - I'm fine.

1136
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,445
里根夫人
Mrs. Reagan.

1137
01:09:59,263 --> 01:10:01,631
晚上好，总统先生
Good evening, Mr. President.

1138
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:04,634
请告诉我你们是共和党人
Please tell me you're Republicans.

1139
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:06,636
今天，总统先生，
Today, Mr. President,

1140
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:09,406
我们都是共和党人
we're all Republicans.

1141
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,361
过来...南希...
Come here... Nancy...

1142
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,506
嗨，南希宝贝
Hi, Nancy Pants.

1143
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:43,673
嗯
Mmm.

1144
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,446
我给你带了糖果
I brought you jelly beans.

1145
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:54,183
我知道你醒来后会想要的
I knew you'd want them when you woke up.

1146
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,955
我必须相信你会醒来
I had to believe you were waking up.

1147
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,359
没有你我可过不好
I don't do so good without you.

1148
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,201
我应该在那里的
I should have been there.

1149
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:15,639
我总是走在你的左边
I always walk on your left side.

1150
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,073
不，不
No, no.

1151
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,776
不
No.

1152
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,811
但那样就会是你了
But then it would have been you.

1153
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:56,813
天哪，你为了那该死的减税什么都愿意做
Boy, you'll do anything to get that damn tax cut.

1154
01:11:56,946 --> 01:12:00,650
我下了明确指令
100码内不允许民主党人
I left specific orders. No democrats within 100 yards.

1155
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:02,285
你只能忍着了
You'll have to grin and bear it.

1156
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,122
- 你怎么样，伙计？ - 嗯，
- How you doing, pal? - Well,

1157
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:09,693
- 我不建议被枪击 - 是啊
- I don't recommend getting shot. - No.

1158
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:14,297
你知道，蒂普，我想这里有...
You know, Tip, I think there is...

1159
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,866
我想这一切都是有原因的
I think there is a reason for all this.

1160
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:20,604
还有一项重大任务要完成，而且...
There's a big job left to be done, and...

1161
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:24,508
无论我还剩多少时间，它...
whatever time I have left, it...

1162
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:27,477
都属于祂
belongs to Him.

1163
01:12:28,612 --> 01:12:30,213
啊
Ah.

1164
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,349
"即使我走过死荫的幽谷，
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

1165
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:34,984
也不怕遭害，
I shall fear no evil,

1166
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:37,153
- 因为你与我同在" - "...同在"
- for thou art with me." - "...with me."

1167
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:41,124
"我一生一世必有恩惠慈爱
"Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all

1168
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:43,493
随着我
the days of my life.

1169
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:46,229
我且要住在耶和华的殿中，
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord

1170
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,797
直到永远"
forever."

1171
01:12:51,134 --> 01:12:54,838
你知道，要不是你那张脸
你本可以成为一名演员
You know, you may have been an actor if it wasn't for that mug of yours.

1172
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:57,741
嗯，男主角太多了
Well, there were too many leading men.

1173
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:02,045
本应要了他的命，差点就成功了
It should have killed him and it almost did.

1174
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:05,081
大多数人不知道当时有多危险
Most people don't know how close it came.

1175
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,583
我们做到了吗？
Did we do it?

1176
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,852
不，我们没有做到，
No, we didn't do it,

1177
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,757
这并不是说类似计划的某个版本
which isn't to say that some version of a similar plan

1178
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,026
不存在于某个抽屉里，
didn't exist in a drawer somewhere,

1179
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,928
因为直到今天肯定还存在
as it certainly does to this day.

1180
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,334
- 你是谁？ - 我是达娜
-  You're who? - I'm Dana.

1181
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:27,370
我今天开始工作
I start work today.

1182
01:13:27,504 --> 01:13:29,272
就是...对，没错
It's... Yeah, right.

1183
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,541
这是诺夫齐格的玩笑吗？
Is this Nofziger's idea of a joke?

1184
01:13:31,675 --> 01:13:33,743
我建议你在特勤局来之前离开
I suggest you leave before the Secret Service get here.

1185
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:35,745
特勤局放我进来的
The Secret Service let me in.

1186
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:37,246
我是说，你是迈克·迪弗对吧？
I mean, you're Mike Deaver, right?

1187
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,385
一个演讲稿写手？为美国总统...
A speech writer? For the President...

1188
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,087
...工作的？
...of the United States?

1189
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,056
- 我想这里有点...
- 达纳，你终于来了
- I think that there's been... - Dana, you're finally here.

1190
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:50,193
刚刚飞到，先生
我甚至还没找到住的地方
Just flew in, sir. I don't even have a place to stay yet.

1191
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:52,729
没有在草坪上过夜，总统先生
Did not spend the night on the lawn, Mr. President.

1192
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:55,231
- 所以你认识这位先生？ - 是的
- So you know this gentleman? - Yes.

1193
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,633
我们认识很久了
We go way back.

1194
01:13:57,501 --> 01:13:59,102
苏联粮食报告
Soviet grain report.

1195
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:02,205
睡得好吗？我们来交换一下
Nice nap. I'll trade ya.

1196
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:05,809
好吧，达纳，我希望你尽快安顿下来
Well, Dana, I want you to hurry up and settle in

1197
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,611
因为我们有很多工作要做
'cause we have a lot of work to do.

1198
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,987
我们这里穿西装
We wear suits here.

1199
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:21,457
好的，迈克是的
Right on, Mike. Yeah.

1200
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,330
你可能有多余的西装
可以借给我在发薪日前穿吗？
Would you maybe have an extra,I could borrow before payday?

1201
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,397
什--
Wh--

1202
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:30,266
让我知道
Let me know.

1203
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:37,140
第一季度的数据低于预期
First quarter numbers are below expectations.

1204
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:38,842
失业率没有变化
Unemployment hasn't budged.

1205
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,644
我认为我们应该重新审视
I think we should reexamine

1206
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:43,012
一些摆在桌面上的增收措施，先生
some of the revenue enhancers on the table, sir.

1207
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,648
增收措施？
Revenue enhancers?

1208
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:48,151
增-- 这就是你们现在在华盛顿
Re-- Is that what you're calling

1209
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,687
称呼增税的方式吗？
tax increases these days in Washington?

1210
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,422
我向美国人民承诺
I told the American people

1211
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:55,424
我会降低税收
that I would lower taxes.

1212
01:14:55,559 --> 01:14:57,293
所以如果这真的是你的想法，
So if that's what you really think,

1213
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:00,764
那你他妈在我的政府里做什么？
then what the hell are you doing in my administration?

1214
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:04,300
总统先生，我们必须平衡这个预算
Mr. President, we simply have to balance this budget.

1215
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,970
你知道，我学到了一两件
关于经济学的事
You know, I've learned a thing or two about economics.

1216
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:09,472
我在尤里卡学院主修经济学
I majored in Economics at Eureka College.

1217
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:12,809
虽然不是你们的常春藤盟校，
Now, it wasn't your Ivy League college,

1218
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:15,444
但我在那里学到了
伊本·赫勒敦的理论，
but there I learned about Ibn Khaldun,

1219
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:17,547
他是埃及的一位统治者
he was a ruler in Egypt.

1220
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,983
他有一个哲学观点让我很有共鸣，
And he had a philosophy that really hit home

1221
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:23,820
特别是当我在好莱坞
处于94%的税率阶层时
when I was in the 94% tax bracket in Hollywood.

1222
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:27,991
那就是当税率较低时，人们会有更多的钱
And that is when taxes are low, people have more money.

1223
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:31,194
当人们有更多钱时，他们会买更多东西
And when people have more money, they buy more things.

1224
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,631
这些东西必须由其他人制造，
Now, these things have to be made by other people

1225
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:38,868
而他们又必须雇用更多人来帮助他们做这些事
who have to hire more people to help them do that.

1226
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:41,404
至于税收，
And as for taxes,

1227
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,640
好吧，上帝只要求10%，
well, the good Lord only asks for 10%,

1228
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:46,710
为什么山姆大叔要求更多呢？
why should Uncle Sam ask for more?

1229
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:48,511
总统先生，
Mr. President,

1230
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:51,147
空中交通管制员威胁要罢工
the Air Traffic Controllers are threatening a strike.

1231
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,249
- 他们可以这么做吗？ - 不行，先生
- Well, can they do that? - No, sir.

1232
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,851
- 从法律上讲？ - 这是必要的公共服务，
- Legally? - Essential public service,

1233
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:57,587
他们都签了不罢工的合同
they have all signed a no-strike contract.

1234
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,589
合同就是合同
A contract is a contract.

1235
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,592
我就是这么学到的
That's the way I learned it.

1236
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,861
他们丧失了工作
They forfeited their jobs.

1237
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:11,067
如果他愿意冒险
让自己的国家陷入混乱，
If he was willing to risk chaos in his own country,

1238
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:14,403
我们只能想象他可能对我们做什么
we could only imagine what he might do to us.

1239
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:22,011
苏联人正在公开进行全面演习
The Soviets are conducting full exercises right out in the open.

1240
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:24,347
德国边境很平静，但看起来他们正在
German border is quiet but it looks like they're moving

1241
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,549
通过铁路运送一些全新的SS-20导弹
some brand new SS-20s by rail.

1242
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:29,385
已经确认了它们在柏林以东20英里处
That's confirmed. They're 20 miles east of Berlin.

1243
01:16:30,486 --> 01:16:33,790
每节火车车厢
都装有一枚带核弹头的弹道导弹
Each rail car contains a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead.

1244
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,459
约翰，他们有多少枚核导弹？
John, how many nuclear missiles do they have?

1245
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,761
三万五千枚
Thirty-five thousand.

1246
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:39,896
- 官方数字 - 那我们呢？
- Officially. - And us?

1247
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,731
两万五千多一点，先生
Twenty-five and change, sir.

1248
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:45,234
所以大约有6万枚核弹头
So roughly 60,000 nuclear warheads

1249
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:48,137
互相对准
每一枚都能摧毁一座城市
pointed at each other, each one can take out a city.

1250
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,106
差不多就是这样，总统先生
That's about the size of it, Mr. President.

1251
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,375
所以在过去十年里，
So while we have been,

1252
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:55,111
当我们一直在削减军事力量时，
over the past ten years, reducing our military,

1253
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,146
他们一直在增加他们的武器库，
they've been building up their arsenal

1254
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,315
并对我们嗤之以鼻，
and thumbing their noses at us,

1255
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,418
违反我们与他们签订的每一项条约
violating every treaty that we have with them.

1256
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:04,788
不仅有可能，先生，这正是正在发生的事情
More than possible, sir, that's exactly what's happening.

1257
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:08,792
除了拍照记录之外，我们对此做了什么？
And what have we done about it except take a picture of it?

1258
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:11,761
好吧，在你发射完前一千枚左右后，
Well, after you fire off the first thousand or so,

1259
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:14,097
就没人能继续计分了，不是吗？
there's no one around to keep score, is there?

1260
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:15,231
这太疯狂了
It's insane.

1261
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:19,736
一个小失误,有人喝了太多伏特加,
One little mistake, somebody has too much vodka,

1262
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:22,305
这一切都不重要了
none of this matters.

1263
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:30,714
今天成千上万的人
聚集在梵蒂冈的圣彼得广场,
Thousands were gathered in St. Peter's Square

1264
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,317
欢呼教皇的到来
at the Vatican today, cheering the arrival of the Pope.

1265
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,121
但很快,枪声将庆祝变成了恐怖,
But soon, gunshots turn the celebration into horror,

1266
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:41,791
教皇倒在了他的助手怀里
as the Pope collapsed into the arms of his aids.

1267
01:17:41,925 --> 01:17:44,427
他正在接受手术官方说法是
He's in surgery. The official story

1268
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,930
他只是擦伤,但实际情况更糟
is that he was grazed but it's worse than that.

1269
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:49,265
他们已经为他做了临终祷告
They gave him his last rites.

1270
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,801
我们了解到什么?
What do we know?

1271
01:17:51,935 --> 01:17:53,636
约翰·保罗来自苏联控制下的波兰
John Paul is from Poland under Soviet control.

1272
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,772
波兰人民渴望自治和民主
Polish people want self-rule and democracy.

1273
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,974
团结工会运动正在席卷全国
Solidarity movement is taking over the nation.

1274
01:17:58,107 --> 01:18:00,276
教皇站在他们这边,
The Pope is with them,

1275
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,046
基本上是在向莫斯科竖中指
因为他可以这么做
basically giving Moscow the middle finger because he can.

1276
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,982
他回祖国访问基本上就像第二次降临
Visit to the homeland is basically the second coming.

1277
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:09,285
事情很明显,这是莫斯科
通过保加利亚做的,总统先生
The writing's on the wall, this comes from Moscow via Bulgaria, Mr. President.

1278
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,320
这绝对是克格勃的手笔
This is KGB all the way.

1279
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:13,056
嗯,这说不通,比尔
Well, that doesn't make sense, Bill.

1280
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,958
他们要么会创造一个殉道者,
They're either gonna create a martyr

1281
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:17,861
要么会激起天主教会
or they're gonna unleash the Catholic Church

1282
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:19,228
对他们的反抗
against themselves.

1283
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:23,900
他们害怕了
They're scared.

1284
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:26,369
教皇活下来了
The Pope lived.

1285
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,773
现在,这位十字军战士和教皇
And now, The Crusader and the Pope

1286
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:33,109
因为都从刺客的子弹下
幸存而建立了联系
shared a bond of having survived an assassin's bullet.

1287
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:38,214
而他的新盟友恰好有10亿追随者
And his new ally just happened to have a billion followers.

1288
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:10,046
离开波兰
Get out of Poland.

1289
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:11,647
离开阿富汗
Get out of Afghanistan.

1290
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:13,749
放弃十年来的条约
Throw away ten years of treaties

1291
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:17,386
并消除所有核导弹
and eliminate all nuclear missiles.

1292
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:21,457
用美国人的话说
勃列日涅夫的脑子都被震惊了
As they say in America, Brezhnev's mind was blown.

1293
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,596
他在黄色纸上
He scribbles

1294
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:32,435
给我写了一封私人便条?
a personal note to me on yellow paper?

1295
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,871
给美国总统?
The President of the United States?

1296
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,574
现在我们知道是谁射击他的了
Now we know who shot him.

1297
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,878
他自己的国务院
His own State Department.

1298
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:44,247
嗯?
Eh?

1299
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,215
不,谢谢
No, thank you.

1300
01:19:50,153 --> 01:19:54,023
现在,他的新国务卿登场了,
And now, enter his new Secretary of State,

1301
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:58,594
- 乔治·舒尔茨,那个老虎人 - 谁?
- George Shultz, the Tiger Man. -  The who?

1302
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,497
他屁股上有一个老虎纹身
He had a tattoo of a tiger on his ass.

1303
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,798
我们怎么知道的？
How do we know that?

1304
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:05,101
克格勃在这里
KGB. Here.

1305
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:13,809
我们就把这个小仪式结束吧
We'll just get this little ceremony over with.

1306
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:16,946
这是我60年代戒烟时用的
This is what I used to quit smoking back in the '60s.

1307
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:19,682
哦，我就知道
Oh, I knew it.

1308
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,252
- 我就知道 - 什么？
- I knew it. -  What?

1309
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:25,688
嗯，你可以从一个人选择
Well, you can tell a lot about a man's character

1310
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,091
是只拿一种颜色
by if he chooses just one color

1311
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:29,592
还是抓一把看出很多东西
or if he grabs a handful.

1312
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,094
我明白了
I see.

1313
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:33,262
那么，这说明我的性格如何？
And, uh, what does this say about my character?

1314
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:35,664
这说明你很专注，
It says that you're focused,

1315
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:37,366
你很坚定，
you're determined,

1316
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,168
而且你不容易分心
and that you're not easily distracted.

1317
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:40,636
你在这里会做得很好的
You're gonna do great here.

1318
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,606
好吧，那么
Okay, then.

1319
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:47,043
美国雇用我们做两件事
America has hired us to do two things.

1320
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:50,113
让他们再次繁荣，
Let them be prosperous again,

1321
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,548
并保证他们的安全
and keep them safe.

1322
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,283
通过实力获得和平
Peace through strength.

1323
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:55,518
我可以畅所欲言吗？
May I speak freely?

1324
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:56,953
我期待你这样做
I expect it.

1325
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:59,488
清晰就是力量
Clarity is power.

1326
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:02,491
现在，我相信
你对这些目标很清楚
Now, I believe you are clear in these objectives.

1327
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,493
现在，世界其他地方也需要清楚
Now, the rest of the world needs to be.

1328
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:06,695
只要这些目标是你的目标
As long as those objectives are your objectives.

1329
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:08,864
是的，克拉克先生这并不是说
They are, Mr. Clark. Which isn't to say

1330
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:11,667
如果我看到这些目标有冲突，
that I won't push back or voice opinions

1331
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,170
我就不会反驳或发表意见
if I see conflict in those objectives.

1332
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:16,039
这正是我选择你的原因
That's exactly why I chose you.

1333
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:17,907
通过实力获得和平，这有点--
Peace through strength is, it's--

1334
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,742
这有点模糊
It's just a-a bit opaque.

1335
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,412
我需要你阐明一个关于苏联的信息
I-I need you to articulate a message about the Soviets

1336
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:25,248
让我可以传达给全世界
that I can take to the world.

1337
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,017
嗯，那很简单
Well, that's simple.

1338
01:21:28,952 --> 01:21:30,053
我们赢
We win.

1339
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:31,420
他们输
They lose.

1340
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:32,855
你可以引用我的话
And you can quote me.

1341
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,326
嗯，这是一个清晰的信息
Well, that's a clear message.

1342
01:22:07,023 --> 01:22:09,358
- 嘿，达奇，你要去哪？ - 来啊，达奇！
- Hey, Dutch, where you going? - Come on, Dutch!

1343
01:22:10,893 --> 01:22:12,795
- 胆小鬼！ - 四眼仔！
- Scaredy-cat! - Four eyes!

1344
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,430
那就是一直威胁你的男孩？
That's the boy that's been threatening you?

1345
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:16,599
- 每天都是 - 过来！
-  Every day. -  Get over here!

1346
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:21,137
- 妈宝男
- 他明天也会在那里
- Mama's boy. - He'll be there tomorrow too.

1347
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,572
这就是恶霸的行为
直到你勇于反抗他们
That's what bullies do until you stand up to them.

1348
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:26,042
是时候解决这个问题了，达奇
It's time for you to settle this, Dutch.

1349
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:28,044
去吧
Go on.

1350
01:22:33,016 --> 01:22:34,150
来啊，妈宝男
Come on, Mama's boy.

1351
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:42,558
打他
Get him.

1352
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:15,924
有点软
It's a little soft.

1353
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:18,127
我们会改进的，先生
We'll get it there, sir.

1354
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:23,099
达纳？我们谈谈
Dana? A word.

1355
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:34,343
我看你还有一只脚留在加利福尼亚
Well, I see you still have one foot in California.

1356
01:23:37,446 --> 01:23:41,784
我即将发动本世纪最大的战争
I am about to start the biggest war of this century.

1357
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:44,053
也许是有史以来最大的
Maybe of all time.

1358
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:47,556
而我不会开一枪
And I'm not gonna fire a single shot.

1359
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:50,393
我将用言语来打这场仗
I'm gonna fight it with words.

1360
01:23:52,095 --> 01:23:56,399
他们必须仔细权衡每一个字
And they have to count every single one of them.

1361
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,135
所以说话要言简意赅，
So say what you mean,

1362
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:00,636
言出必行
mean what you say.

1363
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,873
我需要那个在我院子里露营的人
I need the guy who camped out in my yard.

1364
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:05,974
你明白吗？
You understand?

1365
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:17,653
让我们为那些生活在
And let us pray

1366
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,888
极权主义黑暗中的人
for the salvation of those who live

1367
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:22,158
祈祷救赎
in that totalitarian darkness.

1368
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:26,028
让我们祈祷他们能发现
Let us pray that they will discover

1369
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:27,996
认识上帝的喜悦
the joy of knowing God

1370
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:31,934
让我们意识到，当他们那些未经选举的领导人
and let us be aware that while their unelected leaders

1371
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,437
宣扬国家至上，
preach the supremacy of the State,

1372
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:38,207
宣称国家凌驾于个人之上，
declare its omnipotence over individual man

1373
01:24:38,341 --> 01:24:40,276
并预言最终将统治
and predict its eventual domination

1374
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,345
地球上所有的人民时，
of all the peoples of the Earth,

1375
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:46,048
他们就是现代世界邪恶的焦点
they are the focus of evil in the modern world.

1376
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:48,784
正如C.S.刘易斯
It was C.S. Lewis,

1377
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:53,222
在他出色的《地狱来信》中所写：
who in his magnificent,Screwtape Letters wrote,

1378
01:24:53,356 --> 01:24:55,891
"最大的邪恶并非产生于
"The greatest evil is not done

1379
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:59,528
狄更斯笔下
那些肮脏的犯罪窝点，
in those sordid dens of crime that Dickens loved to paint

1380
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:04,733
也不是在集中营和劳改营中产生
nor is it done in the concentration camps and labor camps.

1381
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:08,271
在那里，我们只看到了它的最终结果
In them, we see its final result.

1382
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,873
但它的构想和指令
But it is conceived and ordered

1383
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,378
来自于干净、铺着地毯
温暖、灯火通明的办公室，
in clear, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices

1384
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:19,348
来自于那些衣冠楚楚
指甲修剪整齐的安静男人，
by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails

1385
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,584
他们不需要提高嗓门，
who do not need to raise their voices,

1386
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:25,521
而是用温和的语调
谈论兄弟情谊和和平"
but speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace."

1387
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:30,359
要警惕忽视历史事实的诱惑，
Beware the temptation to ignore the facts of history,

1388
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:34,062
以及邪恶帝国的侵略冲动
and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire.

1389
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:36,965
没错！
Yes!

1390
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:44,473
我认为总统的话有点不负责任
I think the President's words were a little irresponsible.

1391
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,576
我们现在最不需要的
就是让冷战升温
Last thing we need to do is heat this Cold War up.

1392
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:50,246
虽然总统今晚显然认为...
While the President clearly thought tonight...

1393
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:52,348
这些人怎么回事？
What is wrong with these people?

1394
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,149
我是说，他们到底站在谁那边？
I mean, whose side are they on, anyway?

1395
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:58,187
哦，亲爱的，你不能太在意那些
Oh, honey, you can't pay any attention to that.

1396
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:01,824
但我必须在意
大多数国民都在关注他们
But I have to. Most of the country is paying attention to them.

1397
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:05,661
嗯，如果你觉得
那让他们大为光火，你就等着瞧吧
Well, if you think that got their undies in a wad, you just wait.

1398
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:10,333
我们已经阻止核战争三十多年了
We have prevented nuclear war for more than three decades.

1399
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:14,470
然而，最近已经很明显
我们不能仅仅依靠
Recently, however, it has become clear we cannot rely solely

1400
01:26:14,603 --> 01:26:18,006
进攻性报复来维持和平
on offensive retaliation to maintain peace.

1401
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,476
我呼吁科学界，
I call upon the scientific community,

1402
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:22,878
那些给我们核武器的人，
those who gave us nuclear weapons

1403
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:28,217
现在将他们的伟大才能
用于人类和世界和平的事业
to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace.

1404
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:30,986
建造这个防御性的"导弹盾牌"，
To build this defensive,"missile shield,"

1405
01:26:31,153 --> 01:26:34,857
使这些武器失去作用和过时
rendering these weapons impotent and obsolete.

1406
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,659
如果我们采取这些措施...
If we take these measures...

1407
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:40,062
他从1940年他主演的一部电影中
得到这个想法
He got the idea from a movie he starred in, in 1940.

1408
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:45,701
而且随着经济的繁荣
他现在有钱可以花了
And with his economy booming, he now had the money to spend.

1409
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:48,637
但这东西并不存在
But it didn't exist.

1410
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:49,738
小细节而已
Small detail.

1411
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,041
- 小细节？ - 让我们这么说吧
- Small detail? - Let's just say

1412
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:55,978
他一如既往地乐观
he was characteristically optimistic.

1413
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:57,480
所以他是在撒谎
So he was lying.

1414
01:26:57,613 --> 01:26:59,147
来，吃点东西
Here. Eat something.

1415
01:26:59,282 --> 01:27:00,816
维克托·彼得洛维奇，它根本不存在
Viktor Petrovich, it didn't exist.

1416
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,184
这只是科幻小说
It was science fiction.

1417
01:27:02,318 --> 01:27:04,987
但导弹，导弹是存在的！
But the missiles, missiles did!

1418
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,322
没关系
Doesn't matter.

1419
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,558
十字军正在采取行动
The Crusader was making his move.

1420
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:11,193
我们知道这一点
And we knew it.

1421
01:27:14,363 --> 01:27:15,764
然后发生了一些事
And then something happened.

1422
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:19,201
比如什么？
Like what?

1423
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:39,755
大韩航空，你们正在苏联领空
Korean Airlines, you are in Soviet airspace.

1424
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:41,290
立即离开
Move out now.

1425
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:55,237
指挥部，没有回应
Command, there is no response.

1426
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:57,072
似乎是商业航班
Appears to be commercial flight.

1427
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:59,542
- 击落它- 你确定吗？
-  Shoot it down. -  Are you sure?

1428
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,477
我看到闪烁的指示灯
I see flashing indicators.

1429
01:28:01,644 --> 01:28:04,313
- 击落它- 收到
-  Shoot it down. -  Copy that.

1430
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,068
一架民航客机？
A civilian airliner?

1431
01:28:26,234 --> 01:28:27,703
CIA间谍飞机
CIA spy plane.

1432
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:29,438
他们已经被反复警告过了
They were warned repeatedly.

1433
01:28:29,572 --> 01:28:31,507
那是一架商业航班！
It was a commercial flight!

1434
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,609
两百六十九人
Two hundred and sixty-nine people

1435
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:35,077
都死了，阿纳托利，
are dead, Anatoly,

1436
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:36,979
其中包括我们的一位国会议员！
including one of our congressman!

1437
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:39,281
- 乔治...- 你越界了
-  George... - You crossed a line.

1438
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:53,529
冷战对手之间的紧张局势继续升级
Tensions between the Cold War adversaries continue to escalate.

1439
01:28:53,696 --> 01:28:56,432
里根总统称之为野蛮行径
President Reagan called it an act of barbarism.

1440
01:28:56,599 --> 01:28:59,635
北约军队在整个欧洲保持警戒状态
NATO forces remain on alert across Europe.

1441
01:28:59,802 --> 01:29:01,970
国内外许多人都担心
Many are concerned at home and abroad

1442
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:05,307
这些行动使美国和苏联
that these actions bring the United States and the Soviet Union

1443
01:29:05,474 --> 01:29:08,343
离直接军事冲突更近了一步
a step closer to a direct military conflict.

1444
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:11,614
三周后，
And three weeks later,

1445
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,784
我们的雷达系统检测到了
不可想象的情况
our radar systems detected the unthinkable.

1446
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:21,056
引发了一系列令人恐惧的反应
Triggering a terrifying response of action.

1447
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:27,229
- 这不是演习
- 我们有确认吗？
- This is not a drill. - Do we have confirmation on this?

1448
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,997
苏联正在加热六个地点
Soviets are heating up six sites.

1449
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:30,866
那意味着1800万美国人的生命
That's 18 million,American lives.

1450
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:32,134
他们以为我们要发射，先生
They think we're launching, sir.

1451
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:33,469
准备进入一级战备状态
Prepare for DEFCON 1.

1452
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:35,571
我需要确认
I need confirmation.

1453
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,842
总统先生，如果这是真的
我们没时间确认了
Mr. President, if this is real, we won't have time for confirmation.

1454
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:45,581
我们需要一个决定
We need a decision.

1455
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:50,479
他们正在中止，先生
他们正在撤退
They're aborting, sir. They're standing down.

1456
01:30:50,613 --> 01:30:52,881
好的，先生我会通知他们的
Okay, sir. I'll let them know.

1457
01:30:53,015 --> 01:30:55,651
我们差点就...
We're that close.

1458
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,587
看来是一群鹅触发了雷达的正面反应
Looks like a flock of geese triggered a positive radar hit.

1459
01:30:58,721 --> 01:30:59,922
- 天啊- 啊
- Ah, Jesus. - Ah.

1460
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:02,625
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1461
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:07,796
冷战正处于全面进行中
The Cold War was in full swing.

1462
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:11,767
十字军战士知道
他必须继续对我们施压，
The Crusader knew he had to keep the pressure on us,

1463
01:31:11,934 --> 01:31:14,903
但要确保不再出现错误
but making sure there were no more mistakes.

1464
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:20,308
但在他恢复对我们的讨伐之前，
But before he could resume his crusade against us,

1465
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,511
他必须面对他的选民
he would have to face his voters.

1466
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:28,150
让我们这么说吧
并不是所有人都认为他是正确的选择
And let's just say, not everyone thought he was the right choice.

1467
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,495
啊道貌岸然的人
Ah. Goody two-shoes.

1468
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:51,634
蒙代尔先生的民调支持率
一直在稳步上升
Mr. Mondale's poll numbers have been steadily rising.

1469
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,403
人们对总统的表现表示担忧，
Concerns have been raised as the President has stumbled,

1470
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,539
他在上一场辩论中显得疲惫不堪
appearing tired in the last debate.

1471
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:00,208
里根总统很可能最终成为
President Reagan could very well end up

1472
01:33:00,342 --> 01:33:02,110
一位只当一届的总统
a one-term president.

1473
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:07,582
那么，你如何调整通货膨胀率，呃，
So how do you adjust for inflation, uh,

1474
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:10,786
在6%到12%的预测区间内？
between the six and twelve percent projections?

1475
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:12,788
嗯，你知道，
Well, you know,

1476
01:33:13,722 --> 01:33:17,225
随着四百万...新增就业岗位的增加...
that with the adding of four million...

1477
01:33:21,229 --> 01:33:23,398
三百万新增就业岗位
Three million new jobs

1478
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:26,401
以及失业率的变化...
and the rate of unemployment being...

1479
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:32,941
好了
Okay.

1480
01:33:33,075 --> 01:33:35,410
停下停下
Stop. Stop.

1481
01:33:36,378 --> 01:33:37,713
我需要休息一下
I need a break.

1482
01:33:43,585 --> 01:33:46,254
总统先生，我们真的觉得...
Mr. President, we really feel that...

1483
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:48,056
我-我们只需要重新来过
w-we just need to do this all over again.

1484
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:50,292
不我受够了，埃德
No. I've had enough, Ed.

1485
01:33:51,193 --> 01:33:54,897
那个，总-总统先生，我忘了
您最喜欢的电影是什么？
Say, M-Mr. President, I forgot, what's your favorite movie?

1486
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:57,432
《音乐之声》
The Sound of Music.

1487
01:33:58,433 --> 01:34:00,002
要不您和里根夫人今晚
What do you say, you and Mrs. Reagan

1488
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,670
一起看这部电影怎么样？
get together and watch it tonight?

1489
01:34:01,804 --> 01:34:03,605
放松一下，让头脑平静下来
Relax, calm your mind.

1490
01:34:03,739 --> 01:34:05,073
明天您就能重新振作起来
You'll be back in the saddle tomorrow.

1491
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:07,442
我们也会准备就绪
And we'll be ready to go.

1492
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,745
- 这是个好主意 - 嗯...
- That's a great idea. -  Well...

1493
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:13,782
上帝关上一扇门
就会打开一扇窗，不是吗？
when God closes a door, He opens a window, doesn't He?

1494
01:34:23,558 --> 01:34:24,993
先生们，
Gentlemen,

1495
01:34:25,127 --> 01:34:28,163
与其往他脑子里塞无用的数字，
instead of cramming his head with useless numbers,

1496
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:30,498
为什么不让罗尼做真正的自己呢？
why don't you let,Ronnie be Ronnie?

1497
01:34:31,466 --> 01:34:32,367
好吗？
Okay?

1498
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:39,107
呃，还有人有...
Uh, anybody else have...

1499
01:34:39,274 --> 01:34:40,909
啊哈玛莎？
Aha. Martha?

1500
01:34:41,043 --> 01:34:42,077
是的，父亲
Yes, Father.

1501
01:34:42,244 --> 01:34:43,178
你告诉我
You tell me.

1502
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,181
弗里德里希已经告诉您了，父亲
Friedrich told you, Father.

1503
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:48,683
我们去采浆果了
We were berry picking.

1504
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:51,920
我忘了！你们去采浆果了
I forgot! You were berry picking.

1505
01:34:52,087 --> 01:34:53,621
- 是的！ - 我们喜欢采浆果
-  Yes! - We love berry picking.

1506
01:34:53,789 --> 01:34:54,923
- 整个下午都在采？ - 嗯哼！
-  All afternoon? - Mm-hmm!

1507
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:57,125
- 我们采了成千上万个
- 成千上万个？
-  We picked thousands. - Thousands?

1508
01:34:57,292 --> 01:34:59,094
到处都是浆果
They were all over the place.

1509
01:34:59,261 --> 01:35:00,528
什么种类的浆果？
What kind of berries?

1510
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:02,464
- 蓝莓，先生 - 蓝莓！
-  Blueberries, sir. - Blueberries!

1511
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,166
- 是的！ - 是的！蓝色的！
- Yes! - Yes! Blue!

1512
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:08,403
现在，呃，还太早，蓝莓还没熟
It's, uh, too early for blueberries.

1513
01:35:09,772 --> 01:35:11,406
那些是草莓
They were strawberries.

1514
01:35:11,573 --> 01:35:14,810
特雷维特先生，请向里根总统提问
Mr. Trewhitt, your question to President Reagan.

1515
01:35:14,977 --> 01:35:17,946
总统先生
我想提出一个已经潜伏了两三周的问题，
Mr. President, I wanna raise an issue that I think has been lurking out there

1516
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:20,382
并从国家安全的角度来具体讨论
for two or three weeks, and cast it specifically

1517
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:22,417
从国家安全的角度来看
in national security terms.

1518
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,887
您已经是历史上年纪最大的总统，
You already are the oldest,President in history

1519
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,721
您的一些幕僚说您在最近与
蒙代尔先生的交锋后感到疲惫
and some of your staff say that you were tired

1520
01:35:26,855 --> 01:35:29,724
与蒙代尔先生最近的交锋后感到疲惫
after your most recent encounter with Mr. Mondale.

1521
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:32,828
我记得肯尼迪总统在古巴导弹危机期间
I recall yet that President Kennedy had to go for days on end

1522
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:35,363
不得不连续几天几乎没有睡眠
with very little sleep during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

1523
01:35:35,497 --> 01:35:37,900
您是否有任何疑问，在这种情况下
Is there any doubt in your mind that you would be able to function

1524
01:35:38,033 --> 01:35:39,768
您是否能正常工作？
in such circumstances?

1525
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:41,870
完全没有问题，特雷维特先生
Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt.

1526
01:35:42,004 --> 01:35:43,705
我也想让您知道，
And I want you to know that, also,

1527
01:35:43,839 --> 01:35:47,342
我不会在这次竞选中把年龄作为一个问题
I will not make age an issue in this campaign.

1528
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:50,712
我不会为了政治目的，
I will not for political purposes,

1529
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:54,216
利用我对手的年轻和缺乏经验
exploit my opponent's youth and inexperience.

1530
01:35:58,353 --> 01:36:00,856
就凭这一句机智的话...
And with that one thrust of wit...

1531
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:07,729
他扭转了局势
he turned the tide.

1532
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:26,381
美国！美国！美国！美国！
USA, USA, USA, USA!

1533
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:30,785
- 他会到场的 - 您找我，长官？
- He'll be there. - You wanted to see me, sir?

1534
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:33,588
不，我们会想办法的
No, we'll figure it out.

1535
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:35,991
是的，约翰
Yeah. Yeah, John.

1536
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:39,594
嗯，这里有传言
说你是个...骑马高手
Uh, there's a rumor around here that you're a... a horse guy.

1537
01:36:39,727 --> 01:36:41,396
是的，我曾为波士顿警局骑马
Yup, I rode for Boston PD.

1538
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:44,132
实际上，我一直在骑马为什么问这个？
I've been riding my whole life, really. Why?

1539
01:36:44,266 --> 01:36:46,268
我们在加州的西部白宫
遇到了一些问题
We've been having some issues at the Western White House

1540
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:48,270
- 在加州 - 什么样的问题？
- out in California. - What kind of issues?

1541
01:36:48,403 --> 01:36:49,437
没人会骑马
Nobody can ride.

1542
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,241
是的，"生牛肉"不会说什么
但这挺尴尬的，
Yeah, Rawhide isn't gonna say anything but it's pretty embarrassing

1543
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:55,844
当我们的人想奔跑时却只能牵着马走
when one of ours has to walk his horse when he wants to run.

1544
01:36:55,978 --> 01:36:57,079
你是说驰骋
You mean gallop.

1545
01:36:57,212 --> 01:36:58,146
是的随便了
Yeah. Whatever.

1546
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:02,684
但是，呃，你想在我们出行时
负责那个细节吗？
But, uh, do you wanna head up that detail when we travel?

1547
01:37:05,453 --> 01:37:10,292
所以我会和...总统一起骑马？
So I'd be riding horses with the... with the President?

1548
01:37:11,226 --> 01:37:12,160
驾！
Giddyap.

1549
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:16,331
- 好的 - 很好
- Okay. - All right.

1550
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:23,571
与其他总统不同，
Unlike other presidents,

1551
01:37:23,738 --> 01:37:27,109
这位十字军战士并不急于与我们会面
The Crusader was in no rush to meet with us.

1552
01:37:28,143 --> 01:37:30,312
这造成了一个问题
This created a problem.

1553
01:37:35,951 --> 01:37:37,452
这是最新情况
Here's the latest.

1554
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:47,462
这个，
This here,

1555
01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:49,731
这只是...
this is only...

1556
01:38:03,478 --> 01:38:06,081
如果他们不断死去,我怎么跟他们交谈呢?
How can I talk to them if they keep dying on me?

1557
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:15,023
罗恩,我们正在急需能源
我们必须从某处获得它,
We are starving for energy, Ron, and we've got to get it somewhere

1558
01:38:15,157 --> 01:38:17,692
而且我们负担不起我们一直在支付的价格
and we can't afford what we've been paying.

1559
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:19,827
但是从苏联购买?
But buying it from the Soviet Union?

1560
01:38:19,962 --> 01:38:24,699
你知道那笔钱直接用于
制造指向你的导弹
You know that that money is going directly into a missile pointed at you.

1561
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:26,534
总统先生,
Mr. President,

1562
01:38:27,502 --> 01:38:29,337
给我一个替代方案
give me an alternative.

1563
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:34,509
沙特已同意增加石油产量,
The Saudis have agreed to increase oil production,

1564
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:37,879
只要我们从他们那里购买
而不是从俄罗斯
as long as we buy it from them, not the Russians.

1565
01:38:38,013 --> 01:38:41,416
如果我们能说服
我们的盟友与我们站在一起
And if we can get our friends to go along with us.

1566
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:44,886
你能在国内推销这个吗?
对你的得克萨斯人?
And you can sell this at home? To your Texans?

1567
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,555
这会使油价降到每桶不到10美元
It will drop oil to under ten dollars a barrel.

1568
01:38:47,689 --> 01:38:50,092
哦,我肯定会因此遭受政治打击
Oh, I'll take a political hit for it, that's for sure.

1569
01:38:50,225 --> 01:38:52,694
得克萨斯人喜欢赚钱
是的,他们确实如此
And Texans love to make money, yes, they do.

1570
01:38:52,827 --> 01:38:54,262
我们都喜欢
We all do.

1571
01:38:54,396 --> 01:38:56,564
但他们更爱自由
But they love their freedom even more.

1572
01:38:56,698 --> 01:39:01,603
先是邪恶帝国,现在又是这个
First, the Evil Empire and now this.

1573
01:39:01,736 --> 01:39:03,905
你似乎并不想交朋友
You're certainly not looking to make friends.

1574
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:05,307
不,我不想
No, I'm not.

1575
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,275
但也许你应该
But perhaps you should.

1576
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,077
我见过他们的新人,戈尔巴乔夫
I met their new man, Gorbachev.

1577
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:11,879
他是一个非常不同类型的俄罗斯人
He is a very different kind of Russian.

1578
01:39:12,014 --> 01:39:17,385
我告诉他
你是一个非常非常不同类型
And I told him you were a very, very different kind

1579
01:39:17,519 --> 01:39:19,121
的美国人
of an American.

1580
01:39:22,924 --> 01:39:25,760
- 提高征兵人数好的 - 啊!
- Pushing up the draft. All right. - Ah!

1581
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:27,495
- 哦,哦,哦 - 嘿,嘿安静嘘!
- Ow! Oh, oh. - Hey, hey. Quiet. Shh!

1582
01:39:29,097 --> 01:39:31,399
晚上好里根总统今晚在日内瓦,
Good evening. President Reagan is in Geneva tonight

1583
01:39:31,566 --> 01:39:33,001
准备参加与戈尔巴乔夫的峰会
ready for the Gorbachev summit.

1584
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:38,740
男爵很荣幸能在这个场合
The baron is honored to have you stay at his home

1585
01:39:38,873 --> 01:39:40,642
- 让您入住他的家 - 谢谢
- for this occasion. - Thank you.

1586
01:39:40,775 --> 01:39:42,677
请转达我们的感激之情
Please let him know how much we appreciate it.

1587
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:46,648
呃...[笑] 金鱼
Uh... [chuckles] The goldfish.

1588
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:50,352
似乎男爵的儿子非常喜欢它
It seems that the baron's son is very attached to it.

1589
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,355
它每天需要喂食两次
It needs to be fed twice every day.

1590
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,857
好的,我会亲自喂它的
Well, I will, uh, do it personally.

1591
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:02,097
有些事情,你知道
我还是可以自己做的
There are a few things,I can do myself, you know?

1592
01:40:09,137 --> 01:40:11,206
- 他们到了 - 哦
-  They've arrived. - Oh.

1593
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,308
哦，那么...好的
Oh, then... Yes.

1594
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,311
我们开始吧
Here we go.

1595
01:40:16,444 --> 01:40:18,546
哦，不把外套脱掉
Oh, no. Coat off.

1596
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,315
外面冷得要命
It's below freezing out there.

1597
01:40:20,448 --> 01:40:22,617
全世界都在关注这次会面，乔治
The whole world is watching this meeting, George.

1598
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:25,720
他需要展现最佳状态
那件大衣不行
He needs to look his best, and that overcoat is not working.

1599
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,455
好吧，你们负责政策，
Well, you guys are in charge of policy,

1600
01:40:27,589 --> 01:40:30,392
但即使是自由世界的领导人也有老板，
but even the leader of the free world has a boss,

1601
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,961
而她负责形象呈现
and she's in charge of presentation.

1602
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:38,266
在峰会开始之前，
And before the summit had begun,

1603
01:40:38,433 --> 01:40:41,803
我们发现自己已经处于劣势，
we found ourselves already at a disadvantage,

1604
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:45,507
因为总统看起来比总书记更好
as the President looked better than the General Secretary.

1605
01:40:54,649 --> 01:40:57,552
让我一开始就说明
Let me state at the outset.

1606
01:40:57,685 --> 01:40:59,721
你不应该有任何幻想
You should have no illusions

1607
01:40:59,854 --> 01:41:01,856
认为你能使我们破产
that you can bankrupt us.

1608
01:41:02,023 --> 01:41:04,592
十字军从容应对...
The Crusader took it all in stride...

1609
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:08,530
- 我们可以在陆地上与你匹敌...
- ...听出了其中的真意
- We can match you on land... - ...hearing it for what it was.

1610
01:41:08,663 --> 01:41:12,667
...以及空中和太空
...and air and space.

1611
01:41:14,936 --> 01:41:16,771
这是党的强制性表态
Mandatory messaging from the Party.

1612
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,443
依我看，
As I see it,

1613
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:26,080
我们不是因为武装而互不信任
we don't mistrust each other because we're armed.

1614
01:41:26,214 --> 01:41:28,015
我们武装
We're armed

1615
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:30,685
是因为我们互不信任
because we mistrust each other.

1616
01:41:32,487 --> 01:41:36,057
但我认为我们都同意最重要的一点
But I think that we both agree on the most important thing.

1617
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:40,428
核战争永远不可能赢
A nuclear war can never be won

1618
01:41:40,562 --> 01:41:42,864
也绝不能打
and must never be fought.

1619
01:41:46,534 --> 01:41:48,102
他确实模棱两可
He's definitely ambiguous.

1620
01:41:48,236 --> 01:41:50,572
这很清楚
没有任何模棱两可的地方
It's perfectly clear, there's nothing ambiguous about it.

1621
01:41:50,705 --> 01:41:52,774
你像往常一样占了上风
You come out ahead as you usually do.

1622
01:41:52,907 --> 01:41:56,311
一再违反盐巴 I和II条约
Violation after violation of SALT I and II.

1623
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:59,781
违反？
这不过是你们在太空军事化而已
Violation? This is nothing more than you militarizing space.

1624
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:10,158
我看到他脸上始终挂着温和的微笑
I saw a gentle smile that never left his face.

1625
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:15,463
他很有魅力
但他仍然是那个狂热分子
He was disarming, but still he was the zealot

1626
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:17,865
称我们为邪恶帝国的人
that called us an Evil Empire.

1627
01:42:18,032 --> 01:42:20,335
我们不能放松警惕
And we could not let our guard down.

1628
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:23,771
你知道，我过去常常演戏
You know, I used to do a little acting

1629
01:42:23,905 --> 01:42:26,341
大约二百年前在好莱坞
a couple hundred years ago back in Hollywood.

1630
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:29,010
让我给你展示
我们过去如何处理这种情况
Let me show you how we used to handle this sort of thing.

1631
01:42:37,785 --> 01:42:38,753
第二次拍摄
Take two.

1632
01:42:41,823 --> 01:42:44,025
你好，米哈伊尔我叫罗恩
Hello, Mikhail. My name's Ron.

1633
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,665
你想出去散散步吗？
How would you like to go for a little walk?

1634
01:43:04,279 --> 01:43:06,214
他们说您，总统先生，
What they say about you, Mr. President,

1635
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:09,484
"他掏空你的口袋
还让你感觉良好"
"He picks your pocket and makes you feel good about it."

1636
01:43:09,617 --> 01:43:13,721
嗯，我以前听过
更糟的评价，糟糕多了
Well, I've had much worse said about me before, way worse.

1637
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:16,324
我也是这是我们工作的风险
As have I. Hazard of our job.

1638
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:20,127
我想让您知道
I want to let you know

1639
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:23,698
我们追求的是同一件事，米哈伊尔
that we seek the same thing, Mikhail.

1640
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,033
是吗，罗恩？
Do we, Ron?

1641
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:29,237
我们不是因为必须才来这里的
We are not here because we need to be.

1642
01:43:29,371 --> 01:43:32,006
我们渴望和平，就像您一样
We desire peace, just as you do.

1643
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:36,177
但您的提议并不那么简单
But your proposal is not so simple.

1644
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:39,514
哦，事实上，它很简单
Oh, actually, it is very simple.

1645
01:43:40,882 --> 01:43:42,183
只是不容易
It's just not easy.

1646
01:43:43,818 --> 01:43:48,356
但我相信您和我，我们能做到
But I believe that you and I, we can do it.

1647
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:50,258
事实上，我们必须做到
In fact, we must.

1648
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,427
世界要求我们这么做
The world demands it.

1649
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,596
毕竟，这不就是我们
为之工作的对象吗？
And after all, isn't that who we work for?

1650
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:57,332
人民和上帝
The people and the man upstairs.

1651
01:43:57,465 --> 01:44:00,167
啊上帝
Ah. The man upstairs.

1652
01:44:01,403 --> 01:44:04,071
我祖母是个虔诚的基督徒，
My grandmother was a Christian woman,

1653
01:44:04,205 --> 01:44:06,173
每天都去教堂
go to church every day.

1654
01:44:06,308 --> 01:44:07,909
之后她会说，
And after, would say,

1655
01:44:08,042 --> 01:44:10,445
"米哈伊尔，我今天去了教堂
"Mikhail, I went to church today.

1656
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:12,847
我为无神论者祈祷了
I prayed for the atheist.

1657
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:14,916
我为你祈祷了"
I prayed for you."

1658
01:44:15,049 --> 01:44:18,420
嗯，我想您的祖母和我的母亲
Well, I think that your grandmother and my mother

1659
01:44:18,553 --> 01:44:20,355
本可以成为很好的朋友
could have been very good friends.

1660
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:23,558
所以您就是那个老虎人
So you're the Tiger Man.

1661
01:44:23,691 --> 01:44:25,893
对不起？老虎人？
Excuse me? Tiger Man?

1662
01:44:26,027 --> 01:44:28,696
我很喜欢美国棒球
I like American baseball, very much.

1663
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:30,231
哦，是吗？您最喜欢哪支队伍？
Oh, yeah? Who's your favorite team?

1664
01:44:30,365 --> 01:44:32,400
纽约扬基队您呢？
New York Yankees. And you?

1665
01:44:32,534 --> 01:44:34,569
呃，圣路易斯红雀队
Uh, St. Louis Cardinals.

1666
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:38,072
世界大赛第7场
Game 7, World Series.

1667
01:44:38,205 --> 01:44:41,576
很抱歉，但是什么系列赛？
Very sorry, but what series?

1668
01:44:41,709 --> 01:44:44,379
哦，下次您来美国时
我会确保您能看场比赛
Oh, next time you're in the States, I'll make sure you get to a game.

1669
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:48,583
不，不，不 让他们谈
No, no, no, no. Let them talk.

1670
01:44:48,716 --> 01:44:50,552
你要是进去就被解雇了
You go in there, you're fired.

1671
01:44:54,088 --> 01:44:55,156
老虎人
Tiger Man.

1672
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,792
我的提议是这样的
My proposal...

1673
01:44:59,060 --> 01:44:59,994
就是这个
is this.

1674
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:02,630
您和我，
That you and I,

1675
01:45:02,764 --> 01:45:05,767
在我离任之前，
by the time that I leave office,

1676
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:10,137
能将我们的导弹数量减少一半
can reduce our missile counts by half.

1677
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:12,340
嗯
Hmm.

1678
01:45:14,275 --> 01:45:16,444
我也不是一个有耐心的人
I'm not a patient man either.

1679
01:45:17,879 --> 01:45:20,582
我不打算在他们完全消失之前
I do not intend to leave office

1680
01:45:20,715 --> 01:45:22,149
离开办公室，
before they are gone,

1681
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:23,985
彻底消失
completely.

1682
01:45:39,734 --> 01:45:40,968
哦，不
Oh, no.

1683
01:45:41,102 --> 01:45:42,937
亲爱的，看我做了什么
Honey, look what I've done.

1684
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:44,305
哦，天哪
Oh, dear.

1685
01:45:44,439 --> 01:45:45,940
也许我们可以找到另一条
Maybe we can find another one.

1686
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:48,876
呃，总统先生
我们还有五分钟就要直播了
Uh, Mr. President, we-we go live in five-five minutes.

1687
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,878
哦，我-我觉得我们应该找另一条
Oh, I-I think we should find another one.

1688
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:52,179
哦，不！
Oh, no!

1689
01:45:52,313 --> 01:45:54,348
每个孩子都认识自己的金鱼
Every kid knows his goldfish.

1690
01:45:54,482 --> 01:45:55,817
我要给他写张便条
I'm gonna write him a note.

1691
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:57,351
我-我们现在需要走了
W-we need to go now.

1692
01:45:57,485 --> 01:45:59,821
我是说，全世界都在等着
I mean, the entire world is waiting.

1693
01:45:59,954 --> 01:46:01,689
世界可以等
The world can wait.

1694
01:46:01,823 --> 01:46:04,291
我要给他写张便条
I'm going to write him a note.

1695
01:46:04,426 --> 01:46:08,496
- 南希... - 这就是我的罗尼
-  Nancy... - That's my Ronnie.

1696
01:46:08,663 --> 01:46:12,033
- 我们必须等待
- 除了同意再次会面外，
- We have to wait. -  Nothing was really agreed to yet

1697
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:13,968
实际上还没有达成任何协议
beyond agreeing to meet again.

1698
01:46:14,135 --> 01:46:18,039
但是苏联和美国正在互相交谈，
But the Soviet Union and USA were talking to one another

1699
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:20,374
而不是互相对抗
instead of at one another.

1700
01:46:33,855 --> 01:46:38,025
里根对抗我们的盟友包括教皇、
Reagan's allies against us included the Pope,

1701
01:46:38,192 --> 01:46:40,462
铁娘子撒切尔、
Thatcher, the Iron Lady,

1702
01:46:40,628 --> 01:46:45,166
以及西德和日本的领导人
科尔和中曾根
and leaders of West Germany and Japan, Cole and Nakasone.

1703
01:46:45,299 --> 01:46:47,234
我们坚定地支持你
We stand firmly behind you.

1704
01:46:48,536 --> 01:46:50,905
当你与戈尔巴乔夫秘书谈话时，
When you speak with Secretary Gorbachev,

1705
01:46:52,474 --> 01:46:55,276
你就是在为自由世界的我们发声
you are speaking for us in free world.

1706
01:46:55,443 --> 01:46:56,744
好吧，我们明白
Well, we understand

1707
01:46:56,878 --> 01:46:59,714
你被共产主义者包围着，
that you are surrounded by communists,

1708
01:46:59,847 --> 01:47:02,383
我们感谢你站在我们这边
and we appreciate you standing with us.

1709
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:04,652
要小心记住，
Be careful. Remember,

1710
01:47:04,819 --> 01:47:09,223
共产主义者
为了达到目的不惜说谎
communists have no problem with lying to achieve their goals.

1711
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:12,927
他们在测试你
看你是否会坚定立场
They are testing you to see if you will stand firm.

1712
01:47:13,094 --> 01:47:16,263
别担心我在好莱坞
就和这些家伙打过交道
Don't worry. I dealt with these guys back in Hollywood.

1713
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,633
我背上甚至还有伤疤可以证明
I even have the scars on my back to prove it.

1714
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:20,267
我向你保证，
And I promise you,

1715
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:22,870
我们不会输的
we're not going to lose.

1716
01:47:24,572 --> 01:47:28,075
其他新闻
里根总统已经抵达冰岛雷克雅未克，
In other news, President Reagan has landed in Reykjavík, Iceland

1717
01:47:28,242 --> 01:47:32,079
继续与苏联总理戈尔巴乔夫
就核裁军问题进行讨论
to continue discussions with Soviet Premier Gorbachev over nuclear disarmament.

1718

全面削减百分之五十
Fifty percent across the board reduction.

1719
01:47:36,217 --> 01:47:40,988
所有武器组别,战术武器
中程核武器、洲际弹道导弹
All weapons groups, tactical, INF, ICBM.

1720
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:45,226
作为交换
暂停你们的战略防御计划
In exchange, suspension of your Strategic,Defense Initiative.

1721
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:48,229
有人称之为"星球大战"
"Star Wars," some refer to it.

1722
01:47:50,532 --> 01:47:51,666
反提议
Counter proposal.

1723
01:47:53,568 --> 01:47:57,438
我们分享所有战略防御计划技术,
We share all SDI technology,

1724
01:47:58,405 --> 01:47:59,807
我们共同开发,
we develop it together,

1725
01:48:00,642 --> 01:48:02,510
我们甚至愿意承担费用
we'll even pay for it.

1726
01:48:02,644 --> 01:48:06,514
我们在十年内消除所有弹道导弹,
And we eliminate all ballistic missiles

1727
01:48:06,648 --> 01:48:09,183
共同完成
in ten years. Together.

1728
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:12,654
你们拒绝分享石油钻探技术,
You refuse to share oil-drilling technology

1729
01:48:12,787 --> 01:48:14,288
却提出这个建议?
and you offer this?

1730
01:48:14,421 --> 01:48:19,160
战略防御计划是一个完全防御性的系统
SDI is a completely defensive system.

1731
01:48:22,296 --> 01:48:24,265
这就是底线,总统先生
This is the line, Mr. President.

1732
01:48:25,299 --> 01:48:26,534
如果你离开,
If you walk away,

1733
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:29,804
你将错过成为历史上
you will have missed the chance of going down in history

1734
01:48:29,937 --> 01:48:33,875
为核裁军铺平道路的总统的机会
as the president who paved the way for nuclear disarmament.

1735
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:37,812
你将如何向你的
"自由人民"解释这一点?
How will you explain this to your "free people?"

1736
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,948
总统先生,
Mr. President,

1737
01:48:41,082 --> 01:48:45,019
我正在给你提供你总统任期内最大的胜利
I'm offering you the biggest win of your presidency.

1738
01:48:46,988 --> 01:48:49,056
只要放弃战略防御计划
Just drop SDI.

1739
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:14,849
不
Nyet.

1740
01:49:18,886 --> 01:49:20,254
我们走吧,乔治
Let's go, George.

1741
01:49:28,329 --> 01:49:31,065
你会为这一件事失去整个协议?
You would lose the whole deal over this one thing?

1742
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:32,566
这是一个公平的提议
This is a fair offer.

1743
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,603
我的提议也是
As was mine.

1744
01:49:35,737 --> 01:49:37,705
我不知道我还能做什么
I don't know what more,I could have done.

1745
01:49:40,474 --> 01:49:42,076
你本可以说yes的
You could have said yes.

1746
01:49:46,347 --> 01:49:49,383
在他离开谈判桌后,
After he walked away from the negotiating table,

1747
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:52,153
我们处于一个非常黑暗的境地
we were in a very dark place.

1748
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:54,055
我们知道一切都结束了,
We knew it was over,

1749
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:56,891
除非发生一些非凡的事情
unless something extraordinary happened.

1750
01:50:00,561 --> 01:50:04,598
我们又截获了
两批从古巴运往尼加拉瓜的
We've intercepted two more shipments of Soviet RPGs and AK-47s

1751
01:50:04,732 --> 01:50:07,101
苏联火箭筒和AK-47步枪
coming out of Cuba, headed for Nicaragua.

1752
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:10,271
自由战士们躲在山里
The freedom fighters are holed up in the mountains.

1753
01:50:10,404 --> 01:50:12,774
这是大卫对抗歌利亚,但他们在努力坚持
It's David and Goliath, but they're making a go of it.

1754
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:15,542
嗯,我喜欢这些家伙
Well, I like these guys.

1755
01:50:15,677 --> 01:50:19,046
他们让我想起华盛顿和大陆军
They remind me of Washington and the Continental Army.

1756
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:20,547
他们需要什么?
What do they need?

1757
01:50:20,682 --> 01:50:22,449
他们一直需要什么?
What do they always need?

1758
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:24,218
绷带、枪支和钱
Band-Aids, guns, and money.

1759
01:50:25,352 --> 01:50:27,254
好,给他们想要的
Well, give them what they want.

1760
01:50:27,388 --> 01:50:31,092
总统先生,在这件事上
我们不会得到国会的支持
Mr. President, we won't have the Congress with us on this one.

1761
01:50:40,802 --> 01:50:43,237
除了真相,别无其他
你愿意以上帝的名义发誓吗?
And nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1762
01:50:43,404 --> 01:50:44,672
- 我愿意 - 请坐
- I do. - Please be seated.

1763
01:50:45,773 --> 01:50:47,975
美国国会已经说了不
The American Congress had said no

1764
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:51,112
不给他在尼加拉瓜的朋友们钱
to giving money to his friends in Nicaragua.

1765
01:50:51,278 --> 01:50:54,648
而"十字军"在中东有人质
And The Crusader had hostages in the Middle East

1766
01:50:54,816 --> 01:50:56,617
需要解救他们
and needed to free them.

1767
01:50:56,784 --> 01:51:01,889
但美国的政策是
永远不与恐怖分子谈判
But it was American policy never to negotiate with terrorists.

1768
01:51:02,056 --> 01:51:05,326
但在某处,一个计划诞生了
But somewhere, a plan was hatched.

1769
01:51:10,765 --> 01:51:15,036
里根的伊朗门事件归结为这一点
Reagan's Iran-Contra situation comes down to this.

1770
01:51:15,169 --> 01:51:17,772
总统知道什么,他什么时候知道的?
What did the president know, and when did he know it?

1771
01:51:17,905 --> 01:51:21,342
如果你们这些媒体人想要更多答案,
And if you, people of the press, want any more answers,

1772
01:51:21,475 --> 01:51:23,477
去问里根总统吧
you ask President Reagan.

1773
01:51:23,644 --> 01:51:26,347
他与我们斗争了五十年
Five decades of his struggle against us

1774
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:31,485
最终归结为他能否在国内丑闻中幸存
and it came down to whether he could survive a domestic scandal.

1775
01:51:31,618 --> 01:51:35,522
尽管有各种wildly推测和虚假报道,
In spite of the wildly speculative and false reports,

1776
01:51:35,656 --> 01:51:39,193
我们不与恐怖分子谈判
we do not negotiate with terrorists

1777
01:51:39,326 --> 01:51:41,628
我们也没有用武器
and we did not trade arms

1778
01:51:41,763 --> 01:51:44,065
换取人质
for hostages.

1779
01:51:44,231 --> 01:51:46,934
这些指控可能构成弹劾罪
These accusations are potentially impeachable offenses.

1780
01:51:47,101 --> 01:51:50,204
如果属实,一些观察家认为他的总统任期
And if true, some observers believe his presidency

1781
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:51,873
可能岌岌可危
could be hanging in the balance.

1782
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:54,876
白宫W新闻4台记者卡尔·朗报道
For W News 4 at the White House, I'm Carl Long.

1783
01:52:05,386 --> 01:52:08,255
罗尼,你必须做点什么
Ronnie, you have to do something.

1784
01:52:09,156 --> 01:52:10,157
你看到这个了吗?
Have you seen this?

1785
01:52:11,358 --> 01:52:12,726
是的,我看到了
Yes, I've seen it.

1786
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:14,528
你有在听这些人说话吗?
Are you listening to these people?

1787
01:52:15,362 --> 01:52:18,099
他们只想看到你倒台
They want nothing more than to see you burn.

1788
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:21,836
你知道,他们可能笑着
叫你"总统先生",但他们恨你
You know, they may smile and call you "Mr. President," but they hate you.

1789
01:52:21,969 --> 01:52:24,872
他们恨你说的话
恨你的信仰,恨你这个人
They hate what you say, what you believe in, who you are.

1790
01:52:25,006 --> 01:52:26,740
亲爱的,我就是不能接受这一点
Honey, I just can't accept that.

1791
01:52:26,874 --> 01:52:29,576
不,不,你从来都不能
No, no, you never could.

1792
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:32,679
你是乐观主义者
你总是想看到人性中的善
You're the optimist. You're the one who wants to see the good in people.

1793
01:52:32,814 --> 01:52:35,850
但我的工作就是看穿他们,保护你
But it's my job to see through them and protect you.

1794
01:52:35,983 --> 01:52:39,053
嗯,这就是为什么我们是如此好的搭档
Well, that's why we're such a good team.

1795
01:52:41,488 --> 01:52:45,459
亲爱的,你了解华盛顿
你知道它是如何运作的
Honey, you know Washington. You know the way it works.

1796
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:48,429
- 这只是政治,仅此而已
- 罗尼,他们在谈弹劾!
- It's politics, that's all. - Ronnie, they're talking impeachment!

1797
01:52:48,562 --> 01:52:52,599
- 不会被弹劾的
- 是的,他们想毁掉你!
- No impeachment. - Yes, they wanna destroy you!

1798
01:52:52,733 --> 01:52:55,803
他们要对你进行审判，把你赶下台！
They're putting you on trial, removing you from office!

1799
01:52:55,937 --> 01:52:57,805
这已经不是政治问题了
This isn't about politics anymore.

1800
01:52:57,939 --> 01:52:59,240
这关系到你自己
This is about you.

1801
01:53:00,241 --> 01:53:03,244
一切都岌岌可危再来一个头条新闻，
Everything is at stake. One more headline,

1802
01:53:03,377 --> 01:53:06,113
再来一个重要证人
再来一次逮捕，他们就会这么做
one more star witness, one more arrest, and they will do it.

1803
01:53:06,247 --> 01:53:08,549
我已经与他们合作了
I have cooperated with them.

1804
01:53:08,682 --> 01:53:10,717
我任命了一名特别检察官
I appointed a special prosecutor.

1805
01:53:10,852 --> 01:53:13,754
我已经交出了所有我有的文件
I've turned over every document I have.

1806
01:53:13,888 --> 01:53:15,622
你还要我怎么做？
What would you have me do?

1807
01:53:15,756 --> 01:53:17,491
我要你战斗，
I want you to fight

1808
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:19,460
否则这一切就结束了！
or this is all over!

1809
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,106
你可以雇人来做
You could always hire someone.

1810
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:33,140
哈！
Ha!

1811
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:36,510
怎么，你在找工作吗？
Why, you looking for work?

1812
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:38,179
我有份工作给你，
I got a job for you

1813
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:40,915
在华盛顿
back in Washington.

1814
01:53:41,048 --> 01:53:44,018
你是总统
你随时可以命令我回去
You're the president. You could always order me back there.

1815
01:53:46,087 --> 01:53:48,589
他们会弹劾我吗，比尔？
Are they gonna impeach me, Bill?

1816
01:53:48,722 --> 01:53:51,325
嗯，事情正朝那个方向发展，先生
Well, it's moving in that direction, sir.

1817
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:55,963
总统先生，你是我的朋友
Mr. President, you're my friend.

1818
01:53:56,097 --> 01:53:58,332
我只能直白地跟你说
I can only speak to you straight.

1819
01:53:58,465 --> 01:54:01,002
肯定有一些法律被违反了，
Some laws got broken, for sure,

1820
01:54:01,135 --> 01:54:04,205
不管是你违反的还是别人违反的
whether you broke them or somebody else did.

1821
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:07,641
所以现在你保持沉默并聘请律师
So now you're clamming up and lawyering up.

1822
01:54:07,774 --> 01:54:09,343
这是错误的做法
It's the wrong move.

1823
01:54:09,476 --> 01:54:11,645
这让每个人都感到困惑
甚至是那些爱你的人
It confuses everybody, even the ones that love you.

1824
01:54:13,247 --> 01:54:14,781
人们在想，也许你是...
People are thinking that maybe you're...

1825
01:54:14,916 --> 01:54:16,283
我失去理智了？是的
I'm losing it? Yeah.

1826
01:54:17,651 --> 01:54:18,685
我听说了
I've heard it.

1827
01:54:23,257 --> 01:54:26,027
你认为我应该怎么做，法官？
What do you think,I should do, Judge?

1828
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,661
做你最擅长的事
What you do best.

1829
01:54:27,794 --> 01:54:28,996
告诉他们真相
Tell 'em the truth.

1830
01:54:52,286 --> 01:54:54,888
几个月前，我向美国人民宣称
A few months ago, I told the American people

1831
01:54:55,022 --> 01:54:57,824
我没有以武器换取人质
that I did not trade arms for hostages.

1832
01:54:57,959 --> 01:55:01,895
我的内心和最好的意图
仍然告诉我这是真的，
My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true

1833
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:05,899
但事实和证据告诉我并非如此
but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.

1834
01:55:06,033 --> 01:55:10,237
现在，当你犯错时应该这样做
Now, what should happen when you make a mistake is this.

1835
01:55:10,371 --> 01:55:13,740
你承受批评
你把事情放在正确的角度，
You take your knocks, you put things in perspective,

1836
01:55:13,874 --> 01:55:16,077
你集中你的精力，
you pull your energies together,

1837
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:19,113
你做出改变，然后继续前进
you make changes, and you go forward.

1838
01:55:19,981 --> 01:55:21,182
美国人
Americans.

1839
01:55:21,315 --> 01:55:23,184
你做错了事，你就要付出代价
You do them wrong, you'll pay for it.

1840
01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:28,022
但要看着他们的眼睛
承认你犯了错误，
But look them in the eye, admit you made a mistake,

1841
01:55:28,155 --> 01:55:30,224
他们每次都会原谅你
they forgive you every time.

1842
01:55:45,239 --> 01:55:46,974
他是总统
He was president.

1843
01:55:47,108 --> 01:55:48,809
他必须知道
He had to know.

1844
01:55:51,445 --> 01:55:54,381
他仍然是那个救生员
He was still the lifeguard.

1845
01:55:54,515 --> 01:55:56,783
他要把他的人民带回家
He was going to get his people home.

1846
01:56:01,222 --> 01:56:05,059
罗恩,我对你不太满意
让我们开门见山地说吧
I'm not pleased with you, Ron. Let's just get that said right up front.

1847
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:08,229
嗯,我想不出我哪里惹你生气了
玛格丽特
Well, I can't imagine how I've upset you, Margaret.

1848
01:56:08,362 --> 01:56:10,564
我们又要讨论格林纳达的事吗?
Are we gonna go over Grenada again?

1849
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:13,134
好吧,你当然不能逃避
Well, you're certainly not walking away

1850
01:56:13,267 --> 01:56:15,636
雷克雅未克发生的事...
from what happened at Reykjavík...

1851
01:56:15,769 --> 01:56:17,904
- 不 - 看来你在挑起争端
- No. - Looks like you're picking a fight.

1852
01:56:18,039 --> 01:56:21,108
不,但我不怕争端
No, but I'm not afraid of one.

1853
01:56:21,242 --> 01:56:24,645
也许这就是为什么密特朗称你为
Perhaps that is why,Mitterrand calls you

1854
01:56:24,778 --> 01:56:27,248
"危险的牛仔"
a "dangerous cowboy."

1855
01:56:28,415 --> 01:56:29,316
嗯,
Well,

1856
01:56:30,284 --> 01:56:32,853
至少我有
玛格丽特·撒切尔站在我这边
at least I have,Margaret Thatcher on my side.

1857
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,794
- 他想说出来
- 他确实想,但我们永远无法说服舒尔茨
- He wants to say it. - He does, but we'll never get it past Shultz.

1858
01:56:40,927 --> 01:56:43,330
我是说
这是他们最不想让他谈论的事
I mean, it's the one thing they don't want him talking about.

1859
01:56:43,464 --> 01:56:45,132
我在德国的家人都在谈论这个
My family in Germany is talking about it.

1860
01:56:45,266 --> 01:56:47,468
每个人都在谈论他需要谈论这个
Everybody is talking about it. He needs to talk about it.

1861
01:56:47,601 --> 01:56:49,703
他要去戴维营,然后回到这里待一天,
He's going to Camp David, then he's back here for a day,

1862
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:53,940
之后他要去欧洲
我们只有一次机会让他说这个
then he's going to Europe. We have one shot to have him say this.

1863
01:56:54,075 --> 01:56:55,542
现在或永远不可能
It's now or never.

1864
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:11,658
嘿,把这个给我!我-我来拿谢谢
Hey, give me this! I-I'll take that. Thank you.

1865
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,961
总统先生,一些轻松的读物
Mr. President, some light reading.

1866
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:17,798
嘘!
Shh!

1867
01:57:23,437 --> 01:57:24,638
下午好
Good afternoon.

1868
01:57:27,441 --> 01:57:30,377
你们好,伙计们,今天是个适合飞行的好日子
Hello, fellas, good day to fly.

1869
01:57:30,511 --> 01:57:31,912
不过别来桶滚
No barrel rolls though.

1870
01:58:11,752 --> 01:58:13,887
嗯,我想那其实是第一夫人的问题
Well, I think that's a First Lady question, actually.

1871
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:16,890
你为什么要这样对戈尔巴乔夫?
Why would you do this to Gorbachev?

1872
01:58:17,023 --> 01:58:19,426
你知道我们花了多长时间才达到这一步
You know how long it's taken us to get to this.

1873
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,061
他们已经坐到谈判桌前了
他们准备达成协议,
They're at the table. They're ready to make a deal

1874
01:58:21,195 --> 01:58:22,796
而你想让他难堪?
and you wanna embarrass him?

1875
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:25,732
戈尔巴乔夫是70年来
我们在那边的第一个朋友!
Gorbachev's the first friend we've had over there in 70 years!

1876
01:58:25,866 --> 01:58:28,101
你不能说这个
You can't say this.

1877
01:58:28,235 --> 01:58:30,804
我-我恳求你听我说
I'm-I'm begging you to listen to me.

1878
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:34,308
你知道,当战略防御计划
被嘲笑时我支持了你
You know, I stood by you with SDI when it was ridiculed.

1879
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:36,310
我支持你对付尼加拉瓜反政府武装
I supported you with the Contras.

1880
01:58:36,443 --> 01:58:39,413
我甚至在雷克雅未克会谈上
弄得灰头土脸
I even walked out of Reykjavík with egg on my face.

1881
01:58:39,546 --> 01:58:42,283
但这次太过分了
But this goes too far.

1882
01:58:42,416 --> 01:58:44,218
这比"邪恶帝国"还要糟糕
This is worse than Evil Empire.

1883
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:47,488
你要炸毁日内瓦
你要毁掉八年的外交努力
You're gonna blow up Geneva, you blow up eight years of diplomacy.

1884
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:50,090
我们会回到原点，甚至更糟！
We'll be right back where we started from, or worse!

1885
01:58:53,394 --> 01:58:55,662
"清晰就是力量"
"Clarity is power."

1886
01:58:55,796 --> 01:58:58,965
你知道，一位伟人曾对我说过这句话
You know, a very great man once said that to me.

1887
01:59:00,434 --> 01:59:02,269
乔治，我们来这里是为了什么...
What are we here for, George...

1888
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:05,138
不就是为了赢吗？
but to win?

1889
01:59:13,414 --> 01:59:16,116
在我身后矗立着一堵墙
Behind me stands a wall.

1890
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:19,786
它是一个庞大屏障系统的一部分，
Part of a vast system of barriers

1891
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,789
将整个欧洲大陆一分为二
that divide the entire continent of Europe.

1892
01:59:22,923 --> 01:59:27,428
一道由铁丝网、混凝土、
A gash of barbed wire, concrete,

1893
01:59:27,561 --> 01:59:30,431
警犬和哨塔组成的伤痕，
dogs, and guard towers,

1894
01:59:30,564 --> 01:59:34,535
强加了极权国家的意志
imposing the will of a totalitarian state.

1895
01:59:35,569 --> 01:59:37,704
只要这扇大门还关着，
As long as this gate is closed

1896
01:59:37,838 --> 01:59:40,674
只要这道伤疤还被允许存在，
and this scar is permitted to stand,

1897
01:59:40,807 --> 01:59:45,111
全人类的自由就仍是个问题
there is a question of freedom for all mankind.

1898
01:59:53,487 --> 01:59:56,923
极权主义世界产生落后，
The totalitarian world produces backwardness

1899
01:59:57,090 --> 02:00:01,262
因为它对精神造成了如此大的伤害
because it does such violence to the spirit.

1900
02:00:01,428 --> 02:00:06,833
阻碍了人类创造
享受甚至崇拜的冲动
Thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, even to worship.

1901
02:00:07,768 --> 02:00:11,238
在这里，在柏林
就像这座城市本身一样，
Here in Berlin, like the city itself,

1902
02:00:11,372 --> 02:00:15,175
爱的象征，崇拜的象征
symbols of love, symbols of worship

1903
02:00:15,309 --> 02:00:17,311
是无法被压制的
cannot be suppressed.

1904
02:00:24,885 --> 02:00:28,855
苏联可以做出一个标志，
There is one sign that the Soviets can make,

1905
02:00:28,989 --> 02:00:33,159
这个标志将明确且戏剧性地推进
that would unmistakably and dramatically advance

1906
02:00:33,294 --> 02:00:35,529
自由与和平的事业
the cause of freedom and peace.

1907
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:38,799
戈尔巴乔夫总书记，
General Secretary Gorbachev,

1908
02:00:38,965 --> 02:00:41,167
如果你寻求和平，
if you seek peace,

1909
02:00:41,335 --> 02:00:44,671
如果你寻求自由化和变革，
if you seek liberalization and change,

1910
02:00:44,838 --> 02:00:47,107
就来到这扇门前吧
come here to this gate.

1911
02:00:49,476 --> 02:00:51,745
戈尔巴乔夫先生，
Mr. Gorbachev,

1912
02:00:51,878 --> 02:00:53,614
打开这扇门
open this gate.

1913
02:00:55,181 --> 02:00:56,517
他会说出那句话吗？
Is he gonna say it?

1914
02:01:02,356 --> 02:01:04,525
戈尔巴乔夫先生，
Mr. Gorbachev,

1915
02:01:04,658 --> 02:01:07,060
推倒这堵墙
tear down this wall.

1916
02:01:13,033 --> 02:01:14,768
喔！
Whoo!

1917
02:01:14,901 --> 02:01:17,704
喔！
Whoo!

1918
02:01:27,448 --> 02:01:29,416
干得好，牛仔
Well done, cowboy.

1919
02:02:08,288 --> 02:02:10,090
在冷战的棋局中，
In the chess game of the Cold War,

1920
02:02:11,592 --> 02:02:12,993
这是将军
it was checkmate.

1921
02:02:21,968 --> 02:02:23,770
难以想象的事情
The unimaginable is happening

1922
02:02:23,937 --> 02:02:25,772
正在柏林发生
right now in Berlin.

1923
02:02:25,939 --> 02:02:27,307
令人震惊的事态发展在一夜之间发生
Shocking developments overnight

1924
02:02:27,474 --> 02:02:28,975
东德宣布其公民
as East Germany announced its citizens

1925
02:02:29,142 --> 02:02:31,277
可以自由前往西德
can travel freely to West Germany.

1926
02:02:31,445 --> 02:02:34,114
没人认为可能发生的事情
What no one thought could happen

1927
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,049
此刻正在发生
is happening right now.

1928
02:03:04,611 --> 02:03:07,514
几小时内，城市爆发了庆祝活动
Within hours, the city erupted in celebration

1929
02:03:07,681 --> 02:03:10,116
东德和西德人民
用锤子敲打分隔他们30年的墙壁
as East and West Germans took hammers to the wall

1930
02:03:10,283 --> 02:03:12,419
这堵墙已经将他们分隔了30年
that had separated them for 30 years.

1931
02:03:22,696 --> 02:03:26,032
柏林墙倒塌两年后，
Two years, after the wall fell,

1932
02:03:26,199 --> 02:03:28,168
苏联不复存在
the Soviet Union was no more.

1933
02:03:31,805 --> 02:03:33,874
我知道他就是那个人
I knew he was the one.

1934
02:03:35,476 --> 02:03:38,679
他就是那个会让我们垮台的人
He was the one who would bring us down.

1935
02:03:38,812 --> 02:03:43,049
不是用导弹或枪支，甚至不是用政治
Not with missiles or guns or even politics.

1936
02:03:43,183 --> 02:03:44,885
而是用更伟大的东西
Something much greater.

1937
02:03:51,191 --> 02:03:54,695
人们不会为权力献出生命，
People will not give their lives for power,

1938
02:03:54,828 --> 02:03:57,598
也不会为国家，甚至不会为意识形态
or a State, or even ideology.

1939
02:03:59,032 --> 02:04:01,902
人们会为彼此献出生命，
People give their lives for one another,

1940
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:07,240
为自由选择生活的方式
和为上帝而献身
for the freedom to live those lives as they choose and for God.

1941
02:04:11,344 --> 02:04:12,613
我们剥夺了这一点
We took that away.

1942
02:04:15,381 --> 02:04:16,483
十字军战士...
The Crusader...

1943
02:04:18,418 --> 02:04:19,586
把它还给了他们
gave it back to them.

1944
02:04:31,031 --> 02:04:33,767
这就是你问题的答案
And that is the answer to your question.

1945
02:04:37,638 --> 02:04:39,673
谢谢你，维克多·彼得罗维奇
Thank you, Viktor Petrovich.

1946
02:04:55,889 --> 02:04:56,823
拿去吧
Take it.

1947
02:05:02,963 --> 02:05:03,930
谢谢
Thank you.

1948
02:05:06,299 --> 02:05:07,433
晚安
Good night.

1949
02:05:37,297 --> 02:05:39,065
总统先生，那里发生了什么？
What's going on there, Mr. President?

1950
02:05:42,035 --> 02:05:43,904
这对我来说意义重大
This means something to me.

1951
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:47,708
我知道你在说什么，约翰，
I know what you're saying, John,

1952
02:05:48,675 --> 02:05:50,376
但我不会那么做的
but I'm not gonna do it.

1953
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:53,079
夫人，我需要你告诉他我们不能再这样做了
Ma'am, I need you to tell him we can't do this anymore.

1954
02:05:53,213 --> 02:05:56,016
我不能我不能我做不到
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

1955
02:05:57,818 --> 02:05:59,352
他昨天迷路了
He got lost yesterday.

1956
02:06:00,153 --> 02:06:01,855
我半个小时都找不到他
I couldn't find him for half an hour.

1957
02:06:02,723 --> 02:06:05,759
马知道骑手不知道
自己在做什么，好吗？他...
Horses know when a rider doesn't know what he's doing, okay? He's...

1958
02:06:06,993 --> 02:06:08,328
他会再次被摔下来的
He's gonna get thrown again.

1959
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:12,498
我不能告诉他不能再骑马了
I can't tell him that he can't ride anymore.

1960
02:06:14,968 --> 02:06:16,436
他太喜欢骑马了
He loves it too much.

1961
02:06:18,304 --> 02:06:19,239
拜托
Please.

1962
02:06:23,076 --> 02:06:24,044
好吧
Okay.

1963
02:06:30,483 --> 02:06:32,252
他更爱你，夫人
He loves you more, ma'am.

1964
02:06:52,072 --> 02:06:53,239
总统先生？
Mr. President?

1965
02:06:55,876 --> 02:06:57,243
怎么了，约翰？
What is it, John?

1966
02:07:00,446 --> 02:07:01,481
你知道，呃...
You know, uh...

1967
02:07:03,049 --> 02:07:06,286
我觉得我们骑马的乐趣
已经不如从前了
I don't think we're having as much fun riding as we used to.

1968
02:07:07,453 --> 02:07:09,622
哦，负责里根夫人的特工，她...
Oh, the agent on, uh...

1969
02:07:09,756 --> 02:07:12,125
- 负责里根夫人的特工，她...
- 你想说什么，约翰？
- On Mrs. Reagan, she is... - What do you want, John?

1970
02:07:17,297 --> 02:07:18,665
总统先生，我认为...
Mr. President, I don't--

1971
02:07:20,033 --> 02:07:21,835
我认为我们不应该再骑马了
I don't think we should ride anymore.

1972
02:07:24,871 --> 02:07:25,772
哦
Oh.

1973
02:07:54,167 --> 02:07:55,268
再骑一次
One more ride.

1974
02:07:59,105 --> 02:08:00,473
好的，总统先生
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

1975
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:07,380
嗯
Mm.

1976
02:08:47,687 --> 02:08:49,722
亲爱的美国同胞们
My fellow Americans.

1977
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:53,894
我最近被告知
我是数百万美国人中的一员，
I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans

1978
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:57,663
将会患上阿尔茨海默症
who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.

1979
02:08:57,831 --> 02:09:01,434
此刻，我感觉很好
At the moment, I feel just fine.

1980
02:09:01,434 --> 02:09:05,038
我打算在上帝赐予我的余生里，
I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me

1981
02:09:05,205 --> 02:09:07,240
继续做我一直在做的事情
