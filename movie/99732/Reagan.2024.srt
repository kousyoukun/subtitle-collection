for you just because I'm on your payroll.
我不会因为，我是你的雇员，就帮你破坏工会。

Sorrell, I'm telling you right now, the commie's win.
演员工会是势力最大的。如果他们偏向了索雷尔，我现在告诉你，共产党就赢了。

That ain't happening here.

the camera until they put you out to pasture?

海登先生，在你看来，共产党的努力为什么没有成功?

因为我仍然相信，主席先生，民主能够解决这个问题。

348

communist sympathizers, but I never signed any such letter.
一封支持两名“共产主义同情者”的信上，有我的签名，但我从来未签过这样的名。

There's another Nancy Davis.

Oh, no. No, I cannot do that. No. My
name is very important to me. It's my family.
哦，不。不，我不能那样做。不。我的名字对我来说很重要。这是我的家人。

He was a ruler in Egypt.

who have to hire more people to help them do that.
现在，这些东西必须由其他人来做，他们必须雇佣更多的人，来帮助他们。

is a brand new SS-20s by rail.

（卡斯帕.温伯格，国防部长）

每节车厢都装有一枚带有核弹头的弹道导弹。

（约翰.波因德克斯特，海军上将，时任国家安全事务助理）

972
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,000
So roughly 60,000 nuclear warheads pointed at each other.
所以，大约有六万枚核弹头，互相指向对方。

973
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:49,600
Each one can take out a city.

974
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,940
That's about the size of it, Mr. President.
规模就这么大，总统先生。

So while we have been, over the past 10 years,
reducing our military,
因此，在过去的10年里，我们一直在削减我们的军队，

violating every treaty that we have with them.
违反我们与他们签订的每一项条约。

978
01:17:04,039 --> 01:17:06,119
It's not possible, sir.It's exactly what's happening.
这不合常理，先生，但事情就是这样。

979
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:08,159
And what have we done about it except take a picture of it?
除了拍张照片，我们还做了什么？

980
01:17:08,299 --> 01:17:15,479
Well, after you fire off the first thousand or so,
there's no one around to keep score, is there?
好吧，在你发射了1000枚左右的导弹之后，就没有人来记分了，不是吗?

981
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,719
It's insane.

horror as the Pope collapsed into the arms of his aides.
但很快，枪声把庆祝变成了恐怖，教皇倒在助手的怀里。

that he was grazed,but it's worse than that.
他在做手术。官方的说法是他被擦伤了，但实际情况更糟。
