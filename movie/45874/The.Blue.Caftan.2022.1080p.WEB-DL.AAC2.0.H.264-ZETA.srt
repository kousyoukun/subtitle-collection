1
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,166
Halim!

2
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,666
Can you do the randa too?

3
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,124
Yes, very well.

4
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:38,874
And the braid?

5
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,207
Also.

6
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,374
你干活麻利吗
Are you quick?

7
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,707
我动作很快
I work fast.

8
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,374
等着瞧就知道了
You'll see.

9
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,291
蓝色长袍
THE BLUE CAFTAN

10
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,916
This pink satin is beautiful, too.

11
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,832
也很轻
And lightweight.

12
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,041
我们可以用它做出一些时髦的东西来
We can make something modern out of it.

13
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,457
- 看 你喜欢吗 - 不 不喜欢
- Look. Do you like this? - No, I don't.

14
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,624
真的吗
Really?

15
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,749
The color is soft, the fabric fluid.

16
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,499
很适合你
It suits you.

17
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,332
Otherwise, Bachir has some new fabrics.

18
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,957
如果你找到什么喜欢的
If you find something you like,

19
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,291
我们可以帮你缝制
we can sew it for you.

20
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,499
好 我们会看看的
Okay, we'll go see.

21
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,999
Has Halim started work on my caftan?

22
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,624
还没有 他很忙 但他会很快开始的
Not yet, he was very busy. But he'll begin soon.

23
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,832
你没事吧 米娜
Are you okay, Mina?

24
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,707
没事 谢谢
Yes, thanks.

25
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,166
好吧 我们之后再来 再见
Alright, we'll come back. See you soon.

26
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,041
我要回家了
I'm going home.

27
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,332
- 我和你一起走 - 不 你工作吧
- I'll go with you. - No, you work.

28
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,791
我们进度落后 顾客们都在抱怨了
We're behind, customers are complaining.

29
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,707
Youssef, put away the fabrics, please.

30
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,041
- 叠起来 免得皱了 - 当然
- Fold them so they don't wrinkle. - Of course.

31
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,041
晚上见
See you tonight.

32
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,874
我们金线快用完了 这里有卖的吗
We're low on gold thread. Is it sold around here?

33
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,082
有 不远
Yes, not far.

34
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,791
明天我去买点 如果你要的话
I'll go buy some tomorrow, if you want.

35
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,207
好
Okay.

36
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,791
谁教你的手艺
Who taught you the trade?

37
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,832
我父亲
My father.

38
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,082
He was a maalem.

39
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,207
这家店以前是他的
This store belonged to him.

40
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,124
他一定很为你骄傲
He must have been proud of you.

41
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:28,916
米娜
Mina?

42
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,916
米娜
Mina!

43
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:34,999
我在这儿
I'm here.

44
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,124
你没事吧
Are you alright?

45
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,916
没事 好多了 谢谢
Yes, better. Thanks.

46
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,457
你真的不用休息一下吗
You don't want to get some rest?

47
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,957
不用 我很好
No, I'm fine.

48
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,499
你可以称了
You can weigh them.

49
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,749
再来一两个
One or two more.

50
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,291
不要
No.

51
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,582
要这些
These.

52
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,706
一公斤
One kilo.

53
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,166
6迪拉姆
Six dirhams.

54
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,249
- 给 - 谢谢
- Here you are. - Thank you.

55
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,456
我明天付钱
I'll pay tomorrow.

56
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,499
- 假如好吃的话 - 好
- If they are good! - Sure.

57
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,041
- 等了很久了 - 差不多一小时
- Been waiting long? - About an hour.

58
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,666
但没关系
But it's fine.

59
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,291
- 我能在这里换衣服吗 - 可以 那边
- Can I change up here? - Yes, over there.

60
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,957

Can you get me thread to go with this fabric?

61
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,541
顾客会停下来挑选
The customer will stop by to choose.

62
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,582
好的
Sure.

63
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,041
下次在家里换好衣服
Next time, change at home.

64
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,082
- 抱歉 我以为 - 拜托
- Sorry, I thought. - Come on!

65
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,791
我们没时间浪费了
We've no time to waste.

66
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,666
Halim!

67
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,624
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

68
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:29,749
谢谢
Thank you.

69
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,374
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello. - Hello.

70
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:38,249
看 这就是我想做的
Here, this is the work I want done.

71
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,416
I'm sorry, Fatna

72
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,249
But this work is no longer done.

73
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,916
What do you mean?

74
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,999
You've had this a long time, no?

75
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,832
Yes, fifty years. I got it as a gift at the birth of my eldest.

76
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,541
I knew a maalem who learned with the Jews.

77
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,707
He knew how to do this work.

78
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,124
But he died. May he rest in peace. 

79
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,999
But there must be others?

80
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,957
No, unfortunately.

81
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,124
There are none left.

82
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,707
Will you let me keep it until tomorrow?

83
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,374
- No, no need.. - You'll get it back well-ironed.

84
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,249
And I'll fix this hem so it won't get more damaged.

85
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,374
- 呃 好吧 - 好吧
- Well, all right. - All right.

86
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,082
Fig-shaped buttons.

87
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,874
已经没人知道要怎么做这些了
No one knows how to make these anymore.

88
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,666
看这些针脚的细节
Look at the detail of the stitches,

89
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,291
the perfection of the bows.

90
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:07,249
过了五十年 它还是和以前一样 还是和第一天
Fifty years, it's still the same. Still as beautiful..

91
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,082
一样漂亮
as the first day.

92
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,832
太美了
It is gorgeous.

93
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,082
我能看一眼吗
Can I have a look?

94
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,541
请便
If you'd like.

95
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,291
这个呢
What about this one?

96
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:17,082
这永远不会过时
This one will never go out of style.

97
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,166
你可以用这两个颜色的银线来做
You can have it made with silk thread in these two colors.

98
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,166
会很漂亮的
It will look great.

99
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,749
你还有别的吗 让我看看
Do you have anything else? Let me see..

100
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,499
你看
Here you are.

101
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,082
这很漂亮
It's beautiful.

102
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,416
是的 真是令人震惊
Yes, it's stunning.

103
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,832
但做起来一定很花功夫
But it must take time to make.

104
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,249
- 有点 - 估计一下 要多久呢
- A bit. - How long, more or less?

105
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,457
大概六周
About six weeks.

106
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,499
如果你想要它沿着这里一直下来的话 需要两个月
Two months, if you want it all the way down.

107
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,041
两个月也太久了
Two months is too long.

108
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,291
如果用缝纫机呢
And with a sewing machine?

109
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,416
- 哈利姆从不用缝纫机 - 噢 好吧
- Halim doesn't use sewing machines. - Oh, well.

110
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,957
手工的和机器制造的区别 没人看得出来
No one can tell the difference between hand-made and machine-made.

111
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,999

Now it's the same thing.

112
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,416
We can give you a good price.

113
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:32,957
Youssef.

114
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,457
过来
Come.

115
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,999
裁剪的时候
When cutting,

116
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,457
把布料对齐 捏紧
align the fabric and hold it tight.

117
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,791
不能动
It must not move.

118
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,582
看见了没
See?

119
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,666
过来
Come over here.

120
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,666
做衣领的时候
For the collar,

121
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,624
都要做比较小的花纹
you always have to make a smaller pattern.

122
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,040
继续
Go ahead.

123
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,374
你来做衣领
You do the collar.

124
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,124
- 我从没做过 - 继续
- I've never done it before. - Go ahead.

125
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,874
裁剪布料的时候 给自己留点余地
When you cut the fabric, leave yourself some leeway.

126
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,541
如果你裁得太多 就无法补救了
If you cut too much, there's no going back.

127
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,124
总是记得给自己留多一厘米
And always leave yourself an extra centimeter.

128
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,041
那就是你的边界
That's your margin.

129
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,874
大师傅的一厘米
The maalem's centimeter.

130
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,249
下次 花纹也由你来做
Next time, you'll do the pattern too.

131
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,124
准备好金线 我会用得到
Prepare the gold thread, I'll need it.

132
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:18,624
Meftal or tersan?

133
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,832
Tersan, with three threads.

134
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,207
Balance the tersan with the meftal.

135
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,624
Otherwise it will deform the outfit.

136
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,832
Iron all you like, it won't fall right.

137
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,332
像这样
And like this?

138
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,666
不 你必须沿着一个方向缝进去
No, there's a direction you must sew in.

139
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,541
抱歉 我忘记时间了
Sorry. I lost track of the time.

140
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,541
没事
That's okay.

141
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,249
你有工作在身
You had work to do.

142
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,457
来吧 我热一下晚餐
Come, I'll heat up the dinner.

143
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,749
你不想吃吗
You don't want to eat?

144
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,249
我吃了些橘子 我不饿
I ate some tangerines. I'm not hungry.

145
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,249
有进展吗
Making progress?

146
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,374
他学得快吗
Is he good?

147
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,166
嗯
Yeah.

148
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,416
挺快的
Quite good.

149
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:30,457
他看起来很喜欢这门手艺 他自己想学
He seems to like the craft. He wants to learn.

150
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:33,957
不会有人想学裁缝了 哈利姆
No one wants to learn the craft anymore, Halim.

151
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,082
都结束了
It's all over

152
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,082
你会知道的
You'll see.

153
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,499
很快 他就会告诉你他找到勒令一份工作
Soon, he'll tell you he's found another job

154
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,332
他会成为一个快递员
He'll become a deliveryman

155
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,416
或者在菜市场卖菜
or a vegetable seller at the market.

156
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,457
我不知道
I don't know.

157
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,749
他看起来不同
He seems different.

158
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,207
不 并没有
No, he's not.

159
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,916
他就跟之前几个一样
He's just like the previous ones.

160
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,999
那样的话 我们再找别人
In that case, we'll find someone else.

161
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,374
没关系
It's fine.

162
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,874
说得好像学徒会从天上掉下来
As if apprentices grew on trees.

163
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,124
我自己一个人也可以
I can manage on my own.

164
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,874
我不需要任何人
I don't need anyone.

165
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:22,291
你知道那不可能 我们进度落后太多了
You know that's impossible. We're too far behind.

166
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,332
给
Here.

167
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,332
谢谢
Thanks.

168
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,666
你锁前门了吗
Did you lock the front door?

169
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,166
锁了
Yes.

170
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,666
我今晚想再做一下袍子
I'd like to work more on this caftan tonight.

171
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,666
它缺了几个扣眼
It's missing some grommets.

172
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,374
让我看看
Let me see.

173
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,332
你什么都没跟我说
You didn't tell me anything.

174
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,874
- 你本可以之后再整理线的 - 没关系
- You could've worked the thread later. - It's all right.

175
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,749
用杏仁油摩擦它们
Rub them with almond oil.

176
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,957
它们会好一点
They'll get better.

177
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,041
别管袍子了
And leave the caftan.

178
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,041
你可以明天继续做
You'll work on it tomorrow.

179
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,582
尤瑟夫
Youssef!

180
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,041
过来
Come.

181
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,166
尤瑟夫
Youssef!

182
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:01,499
什么事
Yes?

183
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,166
粉色色丁去哪里了
Where is the pink satin?

184
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,416
在那儿
Over there.

185
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,791
不 没在
No, it's not.

186
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,832
- 我没见过 - 是在那儿还是你没见过
- I haven't seen it. - Over there or you haven't see it?

187
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,832
想好了再说
Make up your mind.

188
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,499
我没碰过
I didn't touch it.

189
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,999
是你把布料收走的
You put the fabrics away.

190
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,416
- 对 但是我 - 对 但是没了
- Yes, but l.. - Yes, but nothing!

191
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:25,916
要么找出来 要么我从你工资里扣
Find it or I'll deduct it from your salary.

192
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,624
那你扣吧
You may as well deduct it then.

193
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,457
你无所谓
You don't care?

194
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,791
如果你什么都没做错的话 那就怪了
Strange, if you did nothing wrong.

195
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,666
你知道 夫人
You know, Ma'am,

196
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:49,041
我从8岁开始就靠自己了
I've gotten by on my own since I was 8

197
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,999
钱时来时去 它不算什么
Money comes and goes. It doesn't matter.

198
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,457
我无所谓
I don't care.

199
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,082
我不是小偷
I'm not a thief.

200
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,541
我知道
I know.

201
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:28,791
这很漂亮
It's pretty.

202
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,874
这金线看起来很美
This gold thread looks good.

203
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,249
做工很好
Good workmanship.

204
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,041
但你应该速度快点
But you should speed up.

205
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:42,124
- 只是这样 - 耐心
- It's just that. - Patience.

206
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:47,457
- 这种刺绣可不容易 - 我付钱不就是为了这个吗
- This kind of embroidery isn't simple - That's what I'm paying for.

207
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,666
没人逼你在这里做
You're not obliged to have it done here.

208
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,124
我丈夫是个大师傅 不是机器
My husband is a maalem, not a machine.

209
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,332
他工作有自己的节奏
And he works at his own pace.

210
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:03,041
如果不满你的意 我立刻就给你退定金
If it does not suit you, I will refund your deposit right away.

211
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:06,541
我们要怎么办
What shall we do?

212
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,291
- 我会回来检查你们的进展 - 悉听尊便
- I'll come check on your progress. - As you wish.

213
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,707
- 再见 - 再见
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

214
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,707
我会做快点的
 I'll work faster. 

215
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:29,166
不 那女人无权指挥你的工作节奏
No. That woman doesn't dictate your pace.

216
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,041
但我们确实需要抓紧了
But we need to advance. 

217
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:33,374
是的 我知道
Yes, I know. 

218
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,707
但这是你几年来做过最漂亮的袍子
But this is the most beautiful outfit you've made in years. 

219
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,541
“我付钱不就是为了这个吗”
"That's what I'm paying for!"

220
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,791
蠢牛
Stupid cow..

221
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:48,374
Your husband pays 4 with all his bribe money.

222
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,291
To hell with her!

223
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,624
Who does she think she is?

224
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:57,707
“
"You don't know how many teas, coffees, cigarettes,

225
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:01,666
"it takes to make this caftan, Madam the district chief's wife!'

226
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:06,082
"Yes! There you go! Less mint tea and more work!"

227
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,999
“我丈夫是大师傅 不是机器”
"My husband is a maalem, not a machine!"

228
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,124
“他有自己的工作节奏 如果你不喜欢 我可以退钱给你”
"He works at his own pace. If you don't like it, I'll refund you.'

229
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:14,624
“听到我说的了吗 马上”
"Hear me? Right away!" 

230
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,832
“我要告诉我老公Abdellatif 他会生气的”
"I'll tell my husband Abdellatif. He won't be happy.'

231
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,957
“你老公”
"Your husband?" 

232
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,874
“Abdellatif”
"Abdellatif?" 

233
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:25,249
“对 我老公 我老公可是区长”
"Yes, my husband! My husband, the district chief!"

234
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,541
“他人脉可广了”
"Who knows everyone!"

235
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:34,707
区长
District Chief! 

236
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:37,749
长官 是呢
Chief, sure!

237
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,249
你要去哪
Where are you going?

238
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,749
我现在不想回家
I don't feel like going home now.

239
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,666
但你得休息 米娜
But you have to rest, Mina.

240
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,957
- We're going to Moha's. - Moha?

241
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,082
Yes, Moha.

242
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:56,166
I walked past that cafe for 15 years, never set foot inside.

243
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,166
So what?

244
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,124
So nothing, I want a mint tea from Moha's.

245
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,207
That's all.

246
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,582
There's a chair.

247
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,874
Hello Halim, what can I get you?

248
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,082
Tea with saffron.

249
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,207
I like to mix them.

250
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,999
And you, my darling?
