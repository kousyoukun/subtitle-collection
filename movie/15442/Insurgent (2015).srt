this great city of ours</font>

somehow behind the attack on abnegation</font>

32
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,647

<font face="Tahoma">Or what?</font>

102
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,675
<font face="Tahoma">Besides I think we all should stick together
now that we are officially fugitives.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">Wait what do you mean
by official fugitives?</font>

104

<font face="Tahoma">You don't know? You
did'nt tell Caleb?</font>

this whole thing on us?</font>

108
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:53,151
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

109
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,452
<font face="Tahoma">And Jeanine needed a
reason to petition to the</font>

<font face="Tahoma">And now she had one.</font>

112
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:09,638
<font face="Tahoma">Staying here at Amity is

113
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:10,964
the best option for now.</font>

114
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:13,292
<font face="Tahoma">We need to keep an eye
of the ground and find

115

out where the rest of
the dauntless are.</font>

Jeanine yourself.</font>

124

-We're on the same side, Tris.</font>

279
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,371
<font face="Tahoma">I'm factionless because I don't fit in any one faction.</font>

280
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:18,673
<font face="Tahoma">And you're Divergent because you belong to too many..</font>

281
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:21,426
<font face="Tahoma">But we are both a threat to Jeanine.</font>

282
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:25,174
<font face="Tahoma">My people are ready for war if that's what it takes.</font>

283
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:26,374
<font face="Tahoma">And then what?</font>

284
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,990
<font face="Tahoma">-We depose those in power.
-And once you've done that?</font>

285
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:35,631
<font face="Tahoma">Once you killed Jeanine, who's in power then?</font>

286
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:41,050
<font face="Tahoma">You see, that's the part she always conveniently leaves out.</font>

287
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,557
<font face="Tahoma">Don't tell me this isn't about you, this is only about you.</font>

288
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,322
<font face="Tahoma">I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding.</font>

289
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:55,477
<font face="Tahoma">-Where?
-They took shelter in Candor.</font>

290
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:57,157
<font face="Tahoma">As far as I know they're still there.</font>

291
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,031
<font face="Tahoma">Think about it. If we were to combine forces,</font>

292
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:05,365
<font face="Tahoma">Dauntless and Factionless, we'd be unstoppable.</font>

293
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:06,769
<font face="Tahoma">That's not gonna happen.</font>

294
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:11,575
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you for your hospitality,
but we will be leaving in the morning.</font>

295
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:13,029
<font face="Tahoma">Four, maybe this is...</font>

296
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:15,390
<font face="Tahoma">Tobias, please reconsider.</font>

297
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,475
<font face="Tahoma">Don't you call me that.</font>

298
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,498
<font face="Tahoma">My name is Four.</font>

299
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,071
<font face="Tahoma">You want to talk him in, or should I?</font>

300
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,878
<font face="Tahoma">The food looks lovely.</font>

301
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:01,623
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

302
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:16,252
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry.</font>

303
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:25,820
<font face="Tahoma">I should've told you about her.</font>

304
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,483
<font face="Tahoma">No more secrets.</font>

305
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:41,067
<font face="Tahoma">Okay?</font>

306
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:54,835
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.</font>

307
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,864
<font face="Tahoma">I always loved to watch him sleep.</font>

308
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:08,411
<font face="Tahoma">I take it you're setting out to Candor in the morning?</font>

309
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,611
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

310
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:18,751
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, I only want what's best for him.</font>

311
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,519
<font face="Tahoma">You hardly even know him.</font>

312
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:26,880
<font face="Tahoma">You'd like to think
that wouldn't you?</font>

313
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,424
<font face="Tahoma">But deep inside I think you're
scared I know him all to well.</font>

314
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,465
<font face="Tahoma">-Im not scared.
-Of course you are.</font>

315
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:39,742
<font face="Tahoma">You're scared that he'll finally
see you for what you really are.</font>

316
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:44,017
<font face="Tahoma">Deadly.</font>

317
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,637
<font face="Tahoma">You don't believe me?</font>

318
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:54,209
<font face="Tahoma">Ask him.</font>

319
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,355
<font face="Tahoma">Are you okey?</font>

320
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:03,555
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

321
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,561
<font face="Tahoma">-Sure?
-Yeah.</font>

322
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:01,251
<font face="Tahoma">-Im not going with you guys.
-What?</font>

323
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,428
<font face="Tahoma">To Candor. I'm not going with you guys.</font>

324
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:12,712
<font face="Tahoma">-What are you talking about?
-What's your plan?</font>

325
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,338
<font face="Tahoma">You guys are gonna find the rest of the Dauntless
and then what?</font>

326
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,967
<font face="Tahoma">You attack Erudite?</font>

327
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,809
<font face="Tahoma">Assasinate Jeanine and start a civil war?</font>

328
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,435
<font face="Tahoma">Im sorry, I'm just not cut out for that.</font>

329
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,951
<font face="Tahoma">I'm not like you guys.</font>

330
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:37,428
<font face="Tahoma">I need to get back to Abnegation maybe...
....Maybe I can be usefull there.</font>

331
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,579
<font face="Tahoma">Caleb, there's nothing left in Abnegation.</font>

332
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:43,975
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

333
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:20,183
<font face="Tahoma">-You okey?
-We just need to get to Candor.</font>

334
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:24,753
<font face="Tahoma">Triss!</font>

335
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,107
<font face="Tahoma">I know you think Caleb is your responsibility
but he made his own choice.</font>

336
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,016
<font face="Tahoma">You can't protect everyone.</font>

337
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:41,463
<font face="Tahoma">-I can't protect anyone.
-Nobody can.</font>

338
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,590
<font face="Tahoma">Him leaving isn't your fault. None of this is your fault.</font>

339
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,099
<font face="Tahoma">Johanna was right. You have to forgive yourself.</font>

340
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,682
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

341
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,685
<font face="Tahoma">We gotta move.</font>

342
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,995
<font face="Tahoma">-We found them!
-Yeah.</font>

343
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,138
<font face="Tahoma">-Damn it's good to see you guys.
-How are you?</font>

344
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,237
<font face="Tahoma">I'm better now. I'm not exactly good for layong low.</font>

345
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:43,766
<font face="Tahoma">-Triss!
-Christina!</font>

346
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:49,312
<font face="Tahoma">-It's so good to see you.
-You too.</font>

347
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:51,545
<font face="Tahoma">Have you heard anything about Will?</font>

348
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,693
<font face="Tahoma">-No.
-Nothing?</font>

349
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:57,893
<font face="Tahoma">No.</font>

350
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:00,981
<font face="Tahoma">Something must have happened to him.</font>

351
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,779
<font face="Tahoma">He would've found me by now you know.</font>

352
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,689
<font face="Tahoma">-Hey.
-Hey.</font>

353
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:09,755
<font face="Tahoma">How are you holding up?</font>

354
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:13,525
<font face="Tahoma">-How many Dauntless do we have?
-175 total.</font>

355
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,226
<font face="Tahoma">-175? That's it?
-The rest followed Max.</font>

356
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,927
<font face="Tahoma">-Not nearly the number we need.</font>

357
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,857
<font face="Tahoma">Hold it! Grab the guns!</font>

358
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:26,813
<font face="Tahoma">-Hey, they're with us.
-We know who you are.</font>

359
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,740
<font face="Tahoma">Last warning. Drop your guns.</font>

360
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,637
<font face="Tahoma">Alright.</font>

361
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,586
<font face="Tahoma">Easy.</font>

362
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,348
<font face="Tahoma">- I'm Jack Kang, I'm leadership here.
-We know who you are.</font>

363
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,232
<font face="Tahoma">We are not a threat to Candor.</font>

364
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:07,214
<font face="Tahoma">That might be your truth, it's not neccesarily mine.</font>

365
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,106
<font face="Tahoma">All I know for certain is you are both wanted for
criminal insurgency and conspiring</font>

366
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:13,865
<font face="Tahoma">in the attack on Abnegation.</font>

367
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,645
<font face="Tahoma">Those are lies.</font>

368
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:21,719
<font face="Tahoma">If you were Candor I would take you at your word.</font>

369
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,635
<font face="Tahoma">Unfortunately given the circumstances
I'm obliged to hand you over to the council.</font>

370
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:29,915
<font face="Tahoma">-You can make your case there.
-You might as well kill us now.</font>

371
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:33,287
<font face="Tahoma">If Jeanine finds us, we're not gonna live to stand trial.</font>

372
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:36,659
<font face="Tahoma">I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the council.</font>

373
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:40,557
<font face="Tahoma">Are you sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her? You?</font>

374
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,030
<font face="Tahoma">Factional law must be upheld.</font>

375
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,142
<font face="Tahoma">No, wait wait wait.</font>

376
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,360
<font face="Tahoma">Can I ask you one question?</font>

377
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:51,285
<font face="Tahoma">Can I ask you one question?</font>

378
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:56,040
<font face="Tahoma">Jeanine believes that Erudite are the most fit
to govern because they are the smartest.</font>

379
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,544
<font face="Tahoma">You believe Candor is the most fittest
to judge because you are so honest?</font>

380
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,168
<font face="Tahoma">I admit, I hold that belief.</font>

381
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,940
<font face="Tahoma">Then, would you say I trial held here at Candor</font>

382
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,712
<font face="Tahoma">would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?</font>

383
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,691
<font face="Tahoma">The answer is yes.</font>

384
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:18,467
<font face="Tahoma">In my opinion a Candor trial would have
the greatest chance of achieving true justice.</font>

385
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,595
<font face="Tahoma">So you are asking me to petition a
council at the great Candor...?</font>

386
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,440
<font face="Tahoma">No. As part of Candors initation
you administer a truth serum.</font>

387
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
<font face="Tahoma">Correct.</font>

388
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,362
<font face="Tahoma">We dont technically discuss such matters with other factions.</font>

389
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:35,225
<font face="Tahoma">-It's a pretty evasive answer.
-Evasion is not dishonest.</font>

390
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:36,830
<font face="Tahoma">But it's not exactly honest either.</font>

391
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,242
<font face="Tahoma">-Yes, we possess such a serum.
-Then use it on us.</font>

392
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,542
<font face="Tahoma">Four!</font>

393
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,242
<font face="Tahoma">If we are guilty, we surrender to the council.</font>

394
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:49,233
<font face="Tahoma">If not, you just saved two lives.</font>

395
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:52,731
<font face="Tahoma">-And gain some loyal allies.
-Alright.</font>

396
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,261
<font face="Tahoma">But you should know the serum can be quite brutal.</font>

397
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:59,862
<font face="Tahoma">It was designed for tender applicants who
are already predisposed to honesty.</font>

398
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:03,055
<font face="Tahoma">Not everyone find it so easy to share their secrets.</font>

399
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:07,017
<font face="Tahoma">-I do not want to do it.
-We have to.</font>

400
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,134
<font face="Tahoma">Neither of us have secrets worth dying for.</font>

401
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,087
<font face="Tahoma">Let the truth set you free.</font>

402
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,800
<font face="Tahoma">Tobias Eaton.</font>

403
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,747
<font face="Tahoma">You are accused of conspiring with your fellow
Dauntless in the attack on Abnegation.</font>

404
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,085
<font face="Tahoma">Is this true?</font>

405
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,976
<font face="Tahoma">Conspiring no.</font>

406
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:56,992
<font face="Tahoma">But I did attack.</font>

407
00:41:57,192 --> 00:41:59,690
<font face="Tahoma">I was in simulation
controlled by Jeanine and</font>

408
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:02,157
<font face="Tahoma">the rest of the Dauntless
she had recruited.</font>

409
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:04,755
<font face="Tahoma">Tris found me.</font>

410
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,382
<font face="Tahoma">She managed to break me free from the simulation
and together we fought are way out.</font>

411
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:19,598
<font face="Tahoma">So you are saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?</font>

412
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,516
<font face="Tahoma">Yes.</font>

413
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,641
<font face="Tahoma">One last thing.</font>

414
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,900
<font face="Tahoma">If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless,

557
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,270
<font face="Tahoma">Jeanine, can I just say it's truly an honor
to finally meet you in person.</font>

558
00:59:05,206 --> 00:59:06,382
<font face="Tahoma">Congratulations mother.</font>

559
00:59:07,784 --> 00:59:09,037
<font face="Tahoma">You got your war.</font>

560
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:13,558
<font face="Tahoma">-I know you wish there was another way.
-But there isn't.</font>

561
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,909
<font face="Tahoma">I'm the lesser of two evils, is that it?</font>

562
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:27,750
<font face="Tahoma">-It better be.
-Tell me...</font>

563
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:30,724
<font face="Tahoma">Why did you surrender to Erudite?</font>

564
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,280
<font face="Tahoma">What do you want?</font>

565
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,570
<font face="Tahoma">I would like a position in your regime.</font>

566
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:43,197
<font face="Tahoma">Ideally I would like a position with
some advancement opportunities.</font>

567
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,832
<font face="Tahoma">I may be Dauntless but I'm not just some meathead.</font>

568
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,651
<font face="Tahoma">No offense, Max.</font>

569
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,138
<font face="Tahoma">Prove your worth to us.</font>

570
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,143
<font face="Tahoma">Then we can discuss your ambitions.</font>

571
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,910
<font face="Tahoma">Great.</font>

572
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,180
<font face="Tahoma">When do I start?</font>

573
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,610
<font face="Tahoma">Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.</font>

574
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,470
<font face="Tahoma">-How do I flush her out?
-It's simple.</font>

575
01:00:11,471 --> 01:00:14,303
<font face="Tahoma">The girl is a walking bleeding heart.
She was borne out of Abegnation.</font>

576
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,960
<font face="Tahoma">It's her weak spot. You just have to know how to press it.</font>

577
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,029
<font face="Tahoma">Help! Come quick.</font>

578
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:34,733
<font face="Tahoma">Traitor Tris Prior must be surrendered to Erudite.</font>

579
01:00:34,734 --> 01:00:37,275
<font face="Tahoma">Or every day more death will follow.</font>

580
01:00:43,526 --> 01:00:44,619
<font face="Tahoma">Hand over Tris Prior.</font>

581
01:00:45,955 --> 01:00:48,080
<font face="Tahoma">Or every day more death will follow.</font>

582
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,844
<font face="Tahoma">Hand over Tris Prior.</font>

583
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,872
<font face="Tahoma">Or every day more death will follow.</font>

584
01:01:00,654 --> 01:01:02,062
<font face="Tahoma">Hand over Tris Prior.</font>

585
01:01:02,262 --> 01:01:04,858
<font face="Tahoma">-Or every day more death will follow.
-Christina!</font>

586
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:06,058
<font face="Tahoma">No!</font>

587
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,500
<font face="Tahoma">Christina!</font>

588
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,610
<font face="Tahoma">Help me!</font>

589
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,570
<font face="Tahoma">Tris!</font>

590
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:03,725
<font face="Tahoma">We removed this from the body of the suicidal.</font>

591
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,243
<font face="Tahoma">Marlene. Her name was Marlene.</font>

592
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:11,661
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry. Marlene.</font>

593
01:02:12,648 --> 01:02:14,959
<font face="Tahoma">It's a very sophisticated sim serum injector.</font>

594
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,100
<font face="Tahoma">It also has a radio transmitter in it's head.</font>

595
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,415
<font face="Tahoma">-How do we get them out?
 -I don't know.</font>

596
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,855
<font face="Tahoma">This tech was built to defend itself.</font>

597
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,240
<font face="Tahoma">This tendril...</font>

598
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,232
<font face="Tahoma">wraps around the nearest major artery.</font>

599
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,662
<font face="Tahoma">If you try to removed them...
and it kills the host.</font>

600
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,410
<font face="Tahoma">Kill the host?</font>

601
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,467
<font face="Tahoma">So what do we do?</font>

602
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:40,659
<font face="Tahoma">Tori must neutralize the disk before we do anything else.</font>

603
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,706
<font face="Tahoma">Or we can do the logical thing.</font>

604
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,580
<font face="Tahoma">We hand her over.</font>

605
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,133
<font face="Tahoma">Nobody knows about this alliance,
we have to protect that advantage.</font>

606
01:02:49,134 --> 01:02:50,790
<font face="Tahoma">If we hand Tris over now...</font>

607
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,319
<font face="Tahoma">it might buy some time.</font>

608
01:03:02,721 --> 01:03:04,073
<font face="Tahoma">I think it's a good idea.</font>

609
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,384
<font face="Tahoma">But you have to go through me first.</font>

610
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:10,040
<font face="Tahoma">-Me too.
-And us.</font>

611
01:03:22,774 --> 01:03:25,278
<font face="Tahoma">I am the one with a time bomb in my arm!</font>

612
01:03:56,037 --> 01:03:57,900
<font face="Tahoma">I know what you're thinking.</font>

613
01:04:00,742 --> 01:04:02,505
<font face="Tahoma">But I'm not gonna let you do it.</font>

614
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:12,196
<font face="Tahoma">I can't let anyone else die because of me.</font>

615
01:04:12,534 --> 01:04:14,631
<font face="Tahoma">No one else is gonna die because of you.</font>

616
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:17,059
<font face="Tahoma">Tori will disable the disk.</font>

617
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:20,452
<font face="Tahoma">-And if she doesn't?
-Then...</font>

618
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:26,706
<font face="Tahoma">If she doesn't, we figure it out.</font>

619
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:29,093
<font face="Tahoma">Together.</font>

620
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:31,796
<font face="Tahoma">You know, I'm just one person.</font>

621
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:37,661
<font face="Tahoma">-I'm not worth it.
-You are worth it.</font>

622
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:39,811
<font face="Tahoma">You are more than worth it to me.</font>

623
01:04:41,566 --> 01:04:43,246
<font face="Tahoma">I love you.</font>

624
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:56,983
<font face="Tahoma">This city may be safe behind a closed wall,</font>

625
01:06:57,457 --> 01:07:02,149
<font face="Tahoma">but make no mistake, that wall alone
doesnt ensure our security.</font>

626
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:11,022
<font face="Tahoma">It's up to us, everyone of us, to remain
vigilant and isolate any threat against us.</font>

627
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:16,383
<font face="Tahoma">There are individuals hiding among
us who must be contained.</font>

628
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:21,059
<font face="Tahoma">Permit me to address the objections from
my fellow faction leaders.</font>

629
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:25,746
<font face="Tahoma">I'm aware that there has been some concerns
about the unavoidable raid on Candor</font>

630
01:07:25,747 --> 01:07:29,297
<font face="Tahoma">so let me be clear.</font>

631
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:34,278
<font face="Tahoma">The harbouring of Divergents from any faction</font>

632
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:36,186
<font face="Tahoma">can not be tolerated.</font>

633
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:40,805
<font face="Tahoma">Very soon I will present
what I believe to be no</font>

634
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:43,775
<font face="Tahoma">less than a mandates from
the founders themselves.</font>

635
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:49,916
<font face="Tahoma">On this I have no doubt on the measure I have taken to keep the peace.</font>

636
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:55,068
<font face="Tahoma">I have provided instructions that will allow
us to eradicate the Divergence crisis</font>

637
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:56,892
<font face="Tahoma">Once and for all.</font>

638
01:08:12,043 --> 01:08:13,573
<font face="Tahoma">Where are you going?</font>

639
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:16,078
<font face="Tahoma">She has left. She's gone.</font>

640
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:19,871
<font face="Tahoma">What? When?</font>

641
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,078
<font face="Tahoma">-Last night.
-Wait.</font>

642
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,559
<font face="Tahoma">Tobias! People look to you for leadership.</font>

643
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,920
<font face="Tahoma">You can't just abandon them</font>

644
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:37,941
<font face="Tahoma">Tobias!</font>

645
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,750
<font face="Tahoma">Wow!</font>

646
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,857
<font face="Tahoma">I have to admit that I'm surprised.</font>

647
01:08:54,184 --> 01:08:56,143
<font face="Tahoma">I mean, I know that you are dumb but..</font>

648
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,829
<font face="Tahoma">I didn't think you were dumb enough
to actually come down here.</font>

649
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:01,589
<font face="Tahoma">And turn yourself in.</font>

650
01:09:07,358 --> 01:09:08,840
<font face="Tahoma">The killings had to stop.</font>

651
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:13,247
<font face="Tahoma">That just shows that you can take the girl from Abnigation</font>

652
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,581
<font face="Tahoma">but you cant take Abnigation out of her.</font>

653
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,300
<font face="Tahoma">Let's go.</font>

654
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,399
<font face="Tahoma">Once a stiff, always a stiff. Right?</font>

655
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,820
<font face="Tahoma">-What is this?
-What is this? This is the whole reason you are locked Tris.</font>

656
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,620
<font face="Tahoma">Man I love knowing stuff you don't.</font>

657
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,580
<font face="Tahoma">I need you to open that box Tris.</font>

658
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:51,816
<font face="Tahoma">The only way to open that box is to
pass the sims of all five factions.</font>

659
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,002
<font face="Tahoma">But te only people who have
tried to it so far have died.</font>

660
01:10:00,744 --> 01:10:02,514
<font face="Tahoma">I don't think I was supposed to tell you that.</font>

661
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,114
<font face="Tahoma">Well...</font>

662
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,790
<font face="Tahoma">No pressure.</font>

663
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:08,959
<font face="Tahoma">Remarkable!</font>

664

<font face="Tahoma">You're the...laws of probability.</font>

666
01:10:21,373 --> 01:10:23,700
<font face="Tahoma">As remarkable as many people you managed to murder?</font>

667
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,902
<font face="Tahoma">Dark times call for extrme measures.</font>

668

<font face="Tahoma">You may find it hard to believe.</font>

669
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:36,456
<font face="Tahoma">But I'm serving the greater good.</font>

674
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,309
<font face="Tahoma">That's okey. You can kill him if you want,
we have plenty of guards.</font>

675
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:33,209
<font face="Tahoma">What?</font>

676
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:16,311
<font face="Tahoma">I'm guesing you need me alive
for this to work. Right?</font>

677
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,220
<font face="Tahoma">Right?!</font>

678
01:12:33,285 --> 01:12:35,489

<font face="Tahoma">My God.</font>

684
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:14,381
<font face="Tahoma">If I do this the suicides stop?</font>

685
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,491
<font face="Tahoma">No. The suicides will continue.</font>

686
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,488

back to Abnegation, were you?</font>

01:24:50,343 --> 01:24:52,362
<font face="Tahoma">I had to do what I though was right.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">The only family I have left.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">What's more selfless than that?</font>

01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,287
<font face="Tahoma">What does Jeanine think

773
01:25:23,312 --> 01:25:24,861
is in that box Caleb?</font>

774
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:26,779
<font face="Tahoma">It's a message from the founders.</font>

775
01:25:27,282 --> 01:25:31,573
<font face="Tahoma">But the box was to be opened
only if the factions broke down.</font>

776
01:25:31,574 --> 01:25:32,572
<font face="Tahoma">Which is why we require

777

someone like you to open it.</font>

778
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:37,128
<font face="Tahoma">You're living proof

are saying right now?</font>

782
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,667
<font face="Tahoma">No one think it's your fault

783
01:25:44,692 --> 01:25:46,159
that you were born this way.</font>

784

01:25:50,857 --> 01:25:52,141
<font face="Tahoma">She killed our parents.</font>

787
01:25:52,142 --> 01:25:54,761
<font face="Tahoma">Are parents brought that on themselves.</font>

788
01:25:54,961 --> 01:25:55,961
<font face="Tahoma">What are you talking about?</font>

789
01:25:57,495 --> 01:25:59,750
<font face="Tahoma">The box, it was in their house.</font>

790
01:25:59,751 --> 01:26:01,653
<font face="Tahoma">They were the ones hiding it.</font>

791
01:26:01,654 --> 01:26:03,755
<font face="Tahoma">All those lives could have been spared.</font>

792
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:08,063
<font face="Tahoma">Seems we didnt knew our parents
as well as we thought we did.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">Alright family reunion is over, it's time to go.</font>

work you're doing here is to the future of the city.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">Please just let Four go.</font>

Do you appreciate irony?</font>

802
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:11,254

you must have the intellectual capacity.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">For instance. Right
now you are full of

hate, but you need to
pass an Amity sim.</font>

806

<font face="Tahoma">that you so dauntlessly
saved in the sim is

809
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,804
the reason you're in
this mess to begin with.</font>
