1
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,470
Know that we have divided in three

2
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,436
our kingdom;

3
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,679
and 'tis our fast intent

4
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,471
to shake all cares and
business from our age,

5
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,116
conferring them on younger strengths,

6
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,270
while we, unburden'd,
crawl to our death.

7
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,353
Our son of Cornwall,

8
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,193
and you, our no less
loving son of Albany,

9
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,739
we have, this hour a constant will

10
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,877
to publish our daughters' several dowers

11
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,195
that future strife may be prevented now.

12
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,356
The Princes France and Burgundy,

13
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,916
great rivals in our
youngest daughter's love,

14
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,317
here are to be answered.

15
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,915
Tell me,

16
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,475
my daughters,

17
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,273
which of you shall we
say doth love us most?

18
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,112
Goneril, our eldest-born,

19
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,395
speak first.

20
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,189
Sir, I love you more than
word can wield the matter;

21
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,757
dearer than eyesight, space or liberty;

22
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,910
beyond what can be valued
rich or rare; no less than life

23
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,877
with grace, health, beauty, honour;

24
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,517
as much as child e'er
loved or father found;

25
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,350
a love that makes breath
poor and speech unable.

26
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,070
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

27
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,076
Of all these bounds,

28
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,953
even from this line to this,

29
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,639
we make thee lady:

30
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,514
To thine and Albany's
issues be this perpetual.

31
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,036
What says our second daughter,

32
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,639
our dearest Regan,

33
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,113
wife of Cornwall?

34
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,795
Speak.

35
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,797
I am made of that self
metal as my sister,

36
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,111
and prize me at her worth.

37
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,318
In my true heart I find she
names my very deed of love;

38
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,037
only she comes too short,

39
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,795
that I profess myself an
enemy to all other joys

40
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,788
which the most precious
square of sense possesses,

41
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,556
and find I am alone felicitate
in your dear Highness' love.

42
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,437
To thee and thine hereditary ever

43
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,393
remain this ample third
of our fair kingdom;

44
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,235
no less in space,

45
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,998
validity and pleasure,

46
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,555
than that conferred on Goneril.

47
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,920
Now, our joy,

48
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,595
although our last and least;

49
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,037
to whose young love the vines
of France and milk of Burgundy

50
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,231
strive to be interess'd;

51
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,715
what can you say to draw a third
more opulent than your sisters?

52
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,355
Speak.

53
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,912
Nothing, my lord.

54
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,154
Nothing!

55
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,914
Nothing.

56
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,829
Nothing will come of nothing.

57
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,075
Speak again.

58
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,753
I love your Majesty according
to my bond; no more nor less.

59
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,279
But goes thy heart with this?

60
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,278
Ay, my good lord.

61
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,473
So young and so untender?

62
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,115
So young, my lord,

63
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,475
and true.

64
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,518
Let it be so!

65
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,597
Thy truth, then, be thy dower!

66
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,077
For, by the secret radiance of the sun,

67
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,711
the mysteries of Hecat and the night;

68
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,311
by all the operation of the orbs
from whom you exist and cease to be;

69
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,433
here I disclaim all my paternal care,

70
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,509
and as a stranger to my heart and
me, hold thee from this for ever!

71
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,755
Royal Lear...

72
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,112
Come not between the
dragon and his wrath.

73
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,635
Cornwall and Albany,

74
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,474
with my two daughters'
dowers, digest the third.

75
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,239
I do invest you jointly with my power,

76
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,718
pre-eminence, and all the large
effects that troop with majesty.

77
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,036
Ourself, by monthly course,

78
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,276
with reservation of an hundred knights,

79
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,471
by you to be sustained,

80
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,593
shall our abode make
with you by due turn.

81
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,318
Only we shall retain the name,

82
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,116
and all the addition to a king:

83
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,434
The sway, revenue,
execution of the rest,

84
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,870
beloved sons, be yours.

85
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,475
Lear is mad!

86
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,592
What would'st thou do, old man?

87
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,872
Thy youngest daughter
does not love thee least.

88
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
The bow is bent and drawn;

89
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,876
make from the shaft.

90
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,308
Let it fall.

91
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,475
Kent, on thy life, no more.

92
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,871
My life I never held

93
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,116
but as a pawn to wage
against thine enemies.

94
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,754
Out of my sight!

95
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,996
See better, Lear.

96
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,158
Now, by Apollo...

97
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,672
Now, by Apollo, King, I'll
tell thee thou dost evil.

98
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,679
Take thy reward.

99
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,960
Turn thy hated back upon our kingdom;

100
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,232
if thy banish'd trunk
be found in our dominion,

101
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,591
the moment is thy death.

102
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,671
Better thou hadst not been born,

103
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,150
than not to have pleas'd me better.

104
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,235
Be it lawful,

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,752
I take up what's cast away.

106
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,078
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.

107
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,311
Thy dow'rless daughter,
King, is Queen of France.

108
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,193
Thou hast her, France; let her be thine;

109
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,637
for we have no such daughter,

110
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,237
nor shall ever see
that face of hers again.

111
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,314
I think our father will away tonight.

112
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,519
That's most certain, and with you;

113
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,993
next month with us.

114
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,034
You see how full of changes his age is;

115
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,077
he always lov'd our sister most;

116
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,037
and with what poor judgement
he hath now cast her off.

117
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,352
'Tis the infirmity of his age;

118
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,548
yet he hath ever but
slenderly known himself.

119
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,239
We shall further think on it.

120
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,355
We must do something,

121
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,475
and i' th' heat.

122
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,229
These late eclipses of the sun
and moon portend no good to us.

123
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,279
In cities, mutinies;

124
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,439
in countries, discord;

125
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,678
in palaces, treason;

126
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,678
and the bond crack'd
between child and father.

127
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,917
We have seen the best of our time:

128
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,549
Machinations, hollowness, treachery,

129
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,679
and all ruinous disorders follow us

130
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,394
disquietly to our graves.

131
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,592
And the noble and
true-hearted Kent banish'd!

132
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,555
'Tis strange.

133
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,549
I do profess to be no less than I seem.

134
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,869
To serve him truly that
will put me in trust.

135
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,039
To love him that is honest.

136
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,275
To converse with him that
is wise and says little.

137
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,355
To fear judgement.

138
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,072
To fight when I cannot choose.

139
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,835
And to eat no fish.

140
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,596
'Tis politic and safe to let him
keep at point a hundred knights;

141
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,598
yes, that on every dream, each buzz,

142
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,791
each fancy, each complaint,

143
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,955
dislike,

144
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,715
he may enguard his
dotage with their pow'rs,

145
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,319
and hold our lives in mercy.

146
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,069
You might fear too far.

147
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,513
Safer than trust too far.

148
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,275
No, no, my lord.

149
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,710
This milky gentleness of
yours shows want of wisdom.

150
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,791
Striving to better,
oft we mar what's well.

151
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,635
Nay, then.

152
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,795
Well, well.

153
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,435
The event.

154
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,557
Did my father strike my
gentleman for chiding of his fool?

155
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,715
Ay, madam.

156
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,672
By day and night he wrongs me;

157
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,873
every hour he flashes into one gross
crime or other that sets us all at odds.

158
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,035
I'll not endure it.

159
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,875
His knights grow riotous,

160
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,389
and himself upbraids us on every trifle.

161
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,599
When he returns from hunting,

162
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,155
I will not speak with
him; say I am sick.

163
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,233
If you come short of former services,

164
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,353
you shall do well;

165
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,152
the fault of it I'll answer.

166
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,110
Put on what weary negligence
you please, you and your fellows.

167
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,835
I'd have it come to question. If he
distaste it, let him to my sister.

168
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,994
Idle old man,

169
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,556
that still would manage those
authorities that he hath given away.

170
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,316
Old fools are babes again.

171
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,350
Let me not stay a jot for dinner;

172
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,395
go get it ready.

173
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,155
What art thou?

174
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,513
A very honest-hearted fellow,
sir, and as poor as the King.

175
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,791
If thou be'st as poor for a
subject as he is for a king,

176
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,879
thou art poor enough.

177
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,075
What would'st thou?

178
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,475
Service.

179
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,753
Who would'st thou serve? You.

180
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,549
Dost thou know me, fellow?

181
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,835
No, sir;

182
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,152
but you have that in your countenance
which I would fain call master.

183
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,878
What's that? Authority.

184
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,555
Follow me;

185
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,039
thou shalt serve me.

186
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,597
If I like thee no worse after dinner,

187
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,313
I'll not part from thee yet.

188
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,035
Let his knights have colder looks
among you; what grows of it no matter.

189
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,514
Dinner!

190
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,276
Ho, dinner!

191
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,792
Where's my knave? My fool?

192
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,231
Go you and call my fool hither.

193
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,637
O you, sirrah, you,

194
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,428
where's my daughter?

195
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,676
Go call the clotpoll back.

196
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,677
Hey, you!

197
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,713
Where is my fool?

198
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,473
I think the world's asleep.

199
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,394
Where's that mongrel?

200
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,034
He says, my lord, your
daughter is not well.

201
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,879
Why came the slave not back
to me when I called him?

202
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,878
He answered me he would not. Would not!

203
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,792
Your Highness is not entertained

204
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,116
with the same ceremonious
affection as you were wont.

205
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,315
Go you and tell my
daughter I'd speak with her.

206
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,836
And go you call hither my fool.

207
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,834
O you,

208
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,752
you, sir.

209
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,678
Come you hither, sir.

210
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,515
Who am I, sir?

211
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,269
My lady's father. "My lady's father"!

212
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,154
You whoreson dog!

213
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,198
You slave!

214
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,675
You cur!

215
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,279
I'll not be struck, my lord.

216
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,914
Nor tripp'd neither,
you base football player.

217
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,717
I'll teach thee a speech.

218
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,515
Do.

219
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,712
This is nothing, fool.

220
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,953
Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?

221
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,469
Why, no, boy; Nothing can be

222
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,397
made out of nothing.

223
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,673
Give me an egg, and I'll
give thee two crowns.

224
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,438
What two crowns shall they be?

225
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,993
Why, after I've cut
the egg in the middle

226
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,429
and eat up the meat,

227
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,759
the two crowns of the egg.

228
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,351
Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
when thou gav'st thy golden one away.

229
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,112
I prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster
that can teach thy fool to lie.

230
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,958
I would fain learn to lie.

231
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,435
And you lie, sirrah,
we'll have you whipp'd.

232
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,756
I marvel what kin thou
and thy daughters are.

233
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,078
They'll have me whipped for
speaking true, for lying,

234
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,157
and sometimes for holding my peace.

235
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,954
I'd rather be any kind
of a thing than a fool;

236
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,798
yet I would not be thee, nuncle;

237
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,998
for thou hast pared thy wits o' both
sides and left nothing in the middle.

238
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,397
<i>Mum, mum! He that keeps
nor crust nor crumb</i>

239
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,955
<i>Weary of all shall want some</i>

240
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,752
When were you wont to
be so full of songs, sirrah?

241
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,951
Ever since thou mad'st
thy daughters thy mothers;

242
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,674
for when thou gav'st them the rod,
and pulled down thine own breeches.

243
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,677
<i>Then they for sudden joy did weep</i>

244
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,996
<i>And I for sorrow sung</i>

245
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,308
<i>That such a king
Should play bo-peep</i>

246
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,511
<i>And go the fools among</i>

247
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,115
Nay,

248
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,553
and thou canst not
smile as the wind sits.

249
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,076
Thou'It catch cold shortly.

250
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,915
Yes, forsooth,

251
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,076
I will hold my tongue;
so your face bids me,

252
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,235
so I'll say nothing.

253
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,999
How now, daughter!

254
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,828
You are too much of late i' th' frown.

255
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,429
Not only, sir, this
your all-licens'd fool,

256
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,076
but other of your insolent
retinue do hourly carp and quarrel,

257
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,158
breaking forth in rank and
not-to-be-endur'd riots.

258
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,075
I had thought, by making this well known
unto you, to have found a safe redress;

259
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,829
but now grow fearful by what
yourself too late have spoke and done,

260
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,157
that you protect this course
and put it on by your allowance;

261
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,998
which if you should, the
fault would not 'scape censure,

262
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,232
nor the redresses sleep.

263
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,599
For you know, nuncle,

264
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,358
the hedge-sparrow fed
the cuckoo so long,

265
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,391
it had its head bit off by its young.

266
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,195
So, out went the candle
and we were left darkling.

267
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,152
Are you our daughter?

268
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,635
I would you would make
use of your good wisdom,

269
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,752
whereof I know you are fraught,
and put away these dispositions

270
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,315
which of late transport you
from what you rightly are.

271
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,919
May not an ass know when the cart draws
the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.

272
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,031
Does any here know me?

273
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,199
This is not Lear.

274
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,312
Does Lear walk thus,

275
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,075
speak thus?

276
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,794
Where are his eyes?

277
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,111
Ha, waking?

278
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,275
'Tis not so.

279
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,196
Who is it who can tell me who I am?

280
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,355
Lear's shadow.

281
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,718
I would learn that.

282
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,235
Your name,

283
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,478
fair gentlewoman?

284
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,513
This admiration, sir, is much of the
savour of other your new pranks.

285
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,558
I do beseech you, understand
my purposes a'right,

286
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,757
as you are old and
reverend should be wise.

287
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,710
Here do you keep a hundred
knights and squires;

288
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,434
as men so disordered,
so debauched and bold,

289
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,633
that this, our court, infected with
their manners, shows like a riotous inn.

290
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,557
Epicurism and lust makes it
more like a tavern or a brothel

291
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,159
than a grac'd palace.

292
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,949
The shame itself doth
call for instant remedy.

293
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,837
Be then advis'd by her that else
will take the thing she begs,

294
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,395
a little to disquantity your train;

295
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,955
and the remainders
that shall still depend

296
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,320
to be such men as may besort your age,

297
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,112
who know themselves

298
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,039
and you.

299
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,592
Darkness and devils!

300
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,993
Saddle my horses!

301
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,279
Call my train together!

302
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,996
Degenerate bastard!

303
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,838
Yet have I left a daughter.

304
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,273
Detested kite,

305
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,755
thou liest!

306
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,748
My train are men of
choice and rarest parts

307
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,678
that all particulars of duty know.

308
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,836
And in the most exact regard

309
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,917
support the worships of their name.

310
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,432
Oh, Lear, Lear, Lear!

311
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,278
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in

312
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,997
and thy dear judgement out.

313
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,513
My lord, I am guiltless,

314
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,476
as I am ignorant of what hath moved you.

315
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,757
It may be so, my lord.

316
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,238
Hear, Nature.

317
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,597
Hear, dear goddess, hear.

318
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,076
Suspend thy purpose,

319
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,233
if thou didst intend to
make this creature fruitful.

320
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,229
Into her womb convey sterility.

321
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,397
Dry up in her the organs of increase;

322
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,191
and from her derogate body never
spring a babe to honour her.

323
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,592
If she must teem,

324
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,349
create her child of spleen,

325
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,429
that it may live and be a
thwart disnatur'd torment to her.

326
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,317
Let it stamp wrinkles
in her brow of youth.

327
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,756
With cadent tears fret
channels in her cheeks.

328
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,039
Turn all her mother's pains and
benefits to laughter and contempt,

329
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,598
that she may feel how sharper
than a serpent's tooth it is

330
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,471
to have a thankless child.

331
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,593
Are my horses ready?

332
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,919
Your asses are gone about them.

333
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,078
Have you writ that letter to my sister?

334
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,235
Ay, madam.

335
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,793
Inform her full of my
particular fear. Get you gone.

336
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,751
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,

337
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,399
to the great love I bear you.

338
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,675
I pray you content.

339
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,516
Shalt see thy other daughter
will use thee kindly;

340
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,594
for although she's as like
this as a crab's like an apple,

341
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,192
yet I can tell what I can tell.

342
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,875
What canst tell, boy?

343
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,517
That she will taste as like
this as a crab does to a crab.

344
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,073
Canst tell why one's nose stands
i' th' middle of one's face?

345
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,635
No.

346
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,911
Why, to keep one's eyes on
either side of one's nose.

347
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,357
That what a man cannot
smell out, he may spy into.

348
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,909
I did her wrong.

349
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,677
Canst tell how an
oyster makes his shell?

350
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,828
No. Nor I, neither.

351
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,076
But I can tell why a snail has a house.

352
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,235
Why?

353
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,750
Why, to put his head in; not to
give it away to his daughters.

354
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,032
I will forget my nature.

355
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,992
So kind a father.

356
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,674
The reason why the seven
stars are no more than seven

357
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,234
is a pretty reason.

358
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,433
Because they are not eight?

359
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,955
Yes, indeed.

360
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,119
Thou wouldst make a good fool.

361
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,795
To take't again perforce.

362
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,756
Monster ingratitude.

363
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,753
If thou wert my fool, nuncle,

364
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,595
I'd have thee beaten for
being old before thy time.

365
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,195
How's that?

366
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,040
Thou shouldst not have been
old till thou hadst been wise.

367
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,712
O, let me not be mad,

368
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,398
not mad, sweet heaven!

369
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,878
Keep me in temper.

370
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,913
I would not be mad.

371
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,555
How now, brother Edmund!

372
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,432
What serious contemplation are you in?

373
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,554
I was thinking, brother, of a
prediction I read this other day,

374
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,632
what should follow these eclipses.

375
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,478
And do you busy yourself with that?

376
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,952
I promise you, the effects he
writes of succeed unhappily;

377
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,472
as of unnaturalness between
the child and the parent;

378
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,954
death, dearth,

379
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,470
dissolution, divisions, menaces.

380
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,634
When we are sick in fortune,

381
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,398
we make guilty of our disasters

382
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,194
the sun, the moon, the stars,

383
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,036
as if we were drunkards,
liars, and adulterers

384
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,912
by planetary influence.

385
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,076
Why brand they me with baseness?

386
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,679
Bastardy? Base?

387
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,190
My father coupled with my
mother under the Dragon's tail,

388
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,560
and I was born under Ursa Major,

389
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,274
so that it follows that
I am rough and lecherous.

390
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,072
I should have been that I am,

391
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,271
had the maidenliest
star in the firmament

392
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,277
twinkled on my bastardizing.

393
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,756
When sons are at perfect age,

394
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,473
and fathers in decline,

395
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,554
the father should be put
in the care of the son.

396
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,352
And the son manage the revenue.

397
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,199
It's the policy of reverence for age

398
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,992
that makes the world bitter.

399
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,152
The Duke of Cornwall and Regan his
Duchess will be here this night.

400
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,597
How comes that? I know not.

401
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,239
The better best!

402
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,993
This weaves itself
perforce into my business.

403
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,910
Briefness and fortune work!

404
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,879
If this letter thrive,

405
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,992
Edmund the bastard
shall top the legitimate.

406
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,873
Legitimate Edgar,

407
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,238
I must have your land.

408
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,835
Now, gods,

409
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,078
stand up for bastards!

410
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,075
Father!

411
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,277
I swore he could by no means.

412
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,833
By no means what?

413
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,238
Persuade me to the
murder of your lordship.

414
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,158
I told him the revenging gods 'gainst
parricides did all the thunder bend;

415
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,354
spoke with how strong a bond the
child was bound to th' father.

416
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,152
My son Edgar.

417
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,272
I threaten'd to discover him.

418
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,075
He replied,

419
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,872
"Who would put any
trust or faith in thee,

420
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,593
"thou unpossessing bastard?"

421
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,676
He cannot be such a monster,

422
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,593
to his father that so tenderly
and entirely loves him.

423
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,477
I dare pawn down my life for him.

424
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,795
He's done this to feel my
affection to your honour,

425
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,877
and no other pretence of danger.

426
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,035
Think you so?

427
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,559
Has he never before
sounded you in this matter?

428
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,598
I have heard him maintain it to be fit

429
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,075
that sons at perfect age
and fathers in decline,

430
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,635
the father should be
put in care of the son,

431
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,877
and the son manage the revenue.

432
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,838
Villain, villain!

433
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,391
Unnatural, brutish villain!

434
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,959
If your honour judge it meet,

435
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,200
I'll place you where you
shall hear us confer of this.

436
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,199
Edgar, when saw you my father last?

437
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,193
Parted you on good terms?

438
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,639
Saw you no displeasure in him?

439
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,110
Bethink yourself wherein
you may have offended him.

440
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,794
What does it say?

441
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,637
"If our father would
sleep till I wak'd him,

442
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,353
"you should enjoy half
his revenue for ever,

443
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,277
"and live the beloved of your brother. "

444
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,234
"Edgar. "

445
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,150
Help! Murder!

446
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,588
When came you to this? I
found it at my casement.

447
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,314
Some villain hath done
me wrong. That's my fear.

448
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,715
Have you not spoken 'gainst
the Duke of Cornwall?

449
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,992
He's coming hither now in the
night, in haste, and Regan with him.

450
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,316
Have you nothing said
against the Duke of Albany?

451
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,711
- Not a word.
- Help!

452
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,754
I've told you what I've
seen and heard but faintly.

453
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,437
Nothing like the image and horror of it.

454
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,273
Pardon me, in cunning I
must draw my sword upon you.

455
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,311
Draw; seem to defend yourself.

456
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,674
Quit you well!

457
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,910
Light, ho, here!

458
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,874
Stop!

459
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,554
Stop!

460
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,274
Torches!

461
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,869
Torches! Where is the villain?

462
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,437
There stood he in the dark, sir.
His sharp sword out.

463
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,314
Pursue him.

464
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,590
Go after, ho!

465
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,359
There!

466
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,196
Loyal and natural boy.

467
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,514
Of all my lands,

468
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,075
I'll work the means
to make thee heritor.

469
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,994
Open up!

470
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,676
Your daughter Regan and
the Duke are gone.

471
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,911
'Tis strange that they
should so depart from home.

472
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,398
As I learned, the night before there
was no purpose in them of this remove.

473
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,636
'Tis said they make toward Gloucester.

474
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,071
Go you before to Gloucester

475
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,511
with these letters.

476
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,076
Acquaint my daughter no
further with anything you know.

477
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,117
If your diligence be not speedy,
I shall be there before you.

478
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,877
Did my father's godson seek your life?

479
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,640
O, madam, my old heart is crack'd.

480
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,117
'Tis too bad, too bad.

481
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,630
I hear that you have shown
your father a child-like office.

482
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,398
It was my duty, sir.

483
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,516
While I can 'scape,
I will preserve myself.

484
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,994
My face

485
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,233
I'll grime with filth

486
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,552
like to a Bedlam beggar.

487
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,514
Poor Tom!

488
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,590
Who gives anything to poor Tom?

489
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,632
Do poor Tom some charity!

490
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,158
Poor Tom!

491
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,234
Edgar,

492
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,834
I

493
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,634
nothing am.

494
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,358
Edgar I nothing am.

495
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,834
Ho!

496
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,675
- Art of this house?
- Ay.

497
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,552
Where may I set my horse?

498
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,038
I' th' mire.

499
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,356
Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.

500
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,596
I love thee not.

501
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,356
Why dost thou use me
thus? I know thee not.

502
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,834
Fellow,

503
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,593
I know thee.

504
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,233
What dost thou know me for?

505
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,476
A knave, beggar,

506
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,592
coward, pander,

507
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,675
and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch.

508
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,871
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

509
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,548
You come with letters against the King,

510
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,718
and take the puppet's part
against the royalty of her father.

511
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,309
You brazen-fac'd varlet!

512
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,513
I'll flesh ye! You wagtail!

513
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,118
You whoreson cullionly barbermonger!

514
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,554
I'll flay you!

515
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,918
A plague upon your epileptic visage!

516
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,156
Peace, shall I know you no reverence?

517
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,748
Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.

518
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,038
Why art thou angry?

519
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,315
My lord, if you will give me leave,

520
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,238
I will tread this unbolted
villain into mortar,

521
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,476
and daub the wall of a jakes with him.

522
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,838
What is his fault?

523
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,436
His countenance likes me not.

524
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,157
No more, perchance, does
mine, nor his, nor hers.

525
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,198
I have seen better faces in my time.

526
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,872
This is some fellow who, having
been prais'd for bluntness,

527
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,991
doth affect a saucy roughness.

528
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,271
He cannot flatter, he, an honest
mind and plain. He must speak truth.

529
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,836
I know, sir, I am no flatterer.

530
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,959
I serve the King.

531
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,957
Fetch forth the stocks.

532
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,272
As I have life and honour,
there shall he sit till noon.

533
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,354
Till noon!

534
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,392
Till night, my lord;

535
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,033
and all night too.

536
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,313
Madam, if I were your father's
dog, you should not use me so.

537
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,238
Sir, being his knave, I will.

538
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,234
Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.

539
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,317
The King must take it ill.

540
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,238
I'll answer that.

541
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,512
My sister may receive it much more
worse to have her gentleman abus'd,

542
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,711
assaulted for following her affairs.

543
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,872
Put in his legs.

544
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,075
I am sorry for thee, friend.

545
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,116
'Twill be ill taken.

546
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,715
I'll entreat for thee.

547
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,069
Pray, do not, sir.

548
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,398
I've travell'd hard; some time I
will sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.

549
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,799
Fortune, good night.

550
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,592
Smile once more.

551
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,352
Turn thy wheel.

552
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,399
<i>Fathers that wear rags</i>

553
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,354
<i>Do make their children blind</i>

554
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,233
Ha, ha!

555
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,236
He wears cruel garters.

556
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,797
What's he that hath so much thy
place mistook to set thee here?

557
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,754
It is both he and she,
your son and daughter.

558
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,636
No. Yes.

559
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,998
No, I say. I say, yea.

560
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,956
No, no, they would not.
Yes, yes, they have.

561
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,559
They durst not do't.

562
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,150
Winter's not gone yet till
the wild geese fly that way.

563
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,036
O, how this mother
swells up toward my heart!

564
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,271
Hysterica passio,

565
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,674
down,

566
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,236
thou climbing sorrow,

567
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,991
thy element's below.

568
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,398
- Where is this daughter?
- With the earl, sir. Within.

569
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,637
Follow me not. Stay here.

570
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,429
How chance the King comes
with so small a number?

571
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,236
An thou hadst been set i'
th' stocks for that question,

572
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,317
thou hadst well deserved it.

573
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,277
We'll set thee to school to an ant,

574
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,596
to teach thee there's no
labouring i' th' winter.

575
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,114
All that follow their nose

576
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,073
are led by their eyes but blind men;

577
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,518
and there's not one nose among twenty
but can smell him that's stinking.

578
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,356
Let go thy hold when a great
wheel runs down the hill,

579
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,835
lest it break thy neck with following;

580
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,751
but the great one that goes upward,

581
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,757
let him draw thee after.

582
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,396
When a wise man gives thee better
counsel, give me mine again.

583
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,434
I would have none but knaves
follow it, since a fool gives it.

584
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,629
That, sir,

585
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,469
<i>Which serves and seeks for gain</i>

586
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,753
<i>And follows but for form</i>

587
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,078
<i>Will pack when it begins to rain</i>

588
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,991
<i>And leave thee in the storm</i>

589
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,032
Where learn'd you this, fool?

590
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,555
Not i' th' stocks, fool.

591
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,432
Deny to speak with me?

592
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,235
They are sick! They are weary!
They have travelled all night!

593
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,032
Fetch me a better answer!

594
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,550
My dear lord, you know the
fiery quality of the Duke.

595
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,354
Fiery? What quality?

596
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,348
Why, Gloucester... Gloucester, I'd speak
with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

597
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,516
Well, my good lord, I
have inform'd them so.

598
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,153
Inform'd them!

599
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,191
Dost thou understand me, man?

600
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,152
Ay, my good lord.

601
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,828
The King would speak with Cornwall.

602
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,679
The dear father would
with his daughter speak;

603
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,950
commands her service.

604
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,716
Are they inform'd of this?

605
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,751
My breath and blood! Fiery?

606
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,837
The fiery Duke?

607
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,636
Tell the hot Duke
that... No, but not yet.

608
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,750
May be he is not well.

609
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,675
Death on my state!

610
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,235
Wherefore should he sit here?

611
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,670
Give me my servant forth.

612
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,440
Tell the Duke and his
wife I'd speak with them.

613
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,474
Now, presently.

614
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,830
Bid them come forth and hear me,

615
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,270
or at their chamber
door I'll beat the drum

616
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,311
till it cry sleep to death.

617
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,193
I would have all well between you.

618
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,832
O me, my heart,

619
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,396
my rising heart!

620
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,113
But, down.

621
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,439
Good morrow to you both.

622
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,471
Hail to your Grace.

623
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,235
I am glad to see your Highness.

624
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,714
Regan,

625
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,798
I think you are;

626
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,636
I have good reason to think so.

627
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,594
Are you free?

628
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,478
Some other time for that.

629
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,592
Beloved Regan,

630
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,950
thy sister is naught.

631
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,632
O Regan, she hath tied sharp-tooth'd
unkindness, like a vulture, here.

632
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,637
I can scarce speak to thee;

633
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,355
thou'It not believe with
how depraved a quality she...

634
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,034
O Regan!

635
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,673
I cannot think my sister in the
least would fail her obligation.

636
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,877
If, so perchance, she has restrained
the riots of your followers,

637
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,071
'tis on such ground and
to such wholesome end

638
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,793
as clears her from all blame.

639
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,798
My curses on her. Sir, you are old.

640
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,472
Nature in you stands on the
very verge of his confine.

641
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,910
You should be rul'd and
led by some discretion

642
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,634
that discerns your state
better than you yourself.

643
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,518
Therefore, I pray you that to
our sister you do make return.

644
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,677
Say you have wrong'd
her. Ask her forgiveness?

645
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,270
Do you but mark how
this becomes the house:

646
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,032
"Dear daughter, I confess that
I am old; age is unnecessary.

647
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,392
"On my knees I beg that you
vouchsafe me raiment, bed and food. "

648
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,114
Good sir, no more;
these are unsightly tricks.

649
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,355
Return you to my sister. Never, Regan.

650
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,755
All the stor'd vengeances
of heaven fall on her!

651
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,633
Blest gods! So will you wish
on me when the rash mood is on.

652
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,558
No, Regan.

653
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,790
Thou shalt never have my curse.

654
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,276
Thy tender-hearted nature shall
not give thee o'er to harshness.

655
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,439
Her eyes are fierce,
but thine do comfort,

656
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,594
not burn.

657
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,631
'Tis not in thee to grudge my pleasures,

658
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,592
to cut off my train,

659
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,396
to bandy hasty words,

660
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,353
to oppose the bolt against my coming in.

661
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,236
Thy half of the kingdom thou hast
not forgot wherein I thee endow'd.

662
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,152
O heavens,

663
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,271
if you do love old men,

664
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,993
if your sweet sway allow obedience,

665
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,035
if you yourselves are old,

666
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,992
make it your cause:

667
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,430
Send down and take my part.

668
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,436
Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?

669
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,994
O Regan, will you take her by the hand?

670
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,595
And why not by the hand,
sir? How have I offended?

671
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,828
All's not offence that indiscretion
finds, and dotage terms so.

672
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,510
O sides, you are too
tough! Will you yet hold?

673
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,078
How came my man i' th' stocks?

674
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,398
I set him there, sir. You, did you?

675
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,437
I pray you, Father,

676
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,835
being weak, seem so.

677
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,396
If till the expiration of your month,

678
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,830
you will return and
sojourn with my sister,

679
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,035
dismissing half your
train, come then to me.

680
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,716
I am now from home and
out of that provision

681
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,036
which shall be needful
for your entertainment.

682
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,275
Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?

683
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,076
No, rather I abjure all roofs,

684
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,915
and choose to wage against
the enmity o' th' air,

685
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,196
to be a comrade with the wolf and owl.

686
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,758
Necessity's sharp pinch!

687
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,837
At your choice, sir.

688
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,429
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.

689
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,230
I will not trouble thee, my child.

690
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,034
Farewell.

691
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,433
We'll no more meet,

692
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,716
no more see one another.

693
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,517
But yet thou art my flesh,

694
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,438
my blood, my daughter;

695
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,153
or rather a disease that's in my flesh

696
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,157
which I must needs call mine;

697
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,510
thou art a boil, a plague-sore,

698
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,156
or embossed carbuncle
in my corrupted blood.

699
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,311
But I'll not chide thee.

700
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,554
Let shame come when it will;

701
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,637
I do not call it.

702
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,149
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,

703
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,470
nor tell tales of thee
to high-judging Jove.

704
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,439
Mend when thou canst;

705
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,076
be better at thy leisure;

706
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,792
I can be patient;

707
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,509
I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.

708
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,390
Why might not you, my lord, receive
attendance from those that she calls...

709
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,953
servants, or from mine?

710
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,718
Why not, my lord?

711
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,115
If then they chanc'd to slack
you, we could control them.

712
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,392
If you will come to me,

713
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,396
for now I spy a danger.

714
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,636
I entreat you to bring
but five and twenty.

715
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,192
To no more will I give place or notice.

716
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,072
I gave you all.

717
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,077
And in good time you gave it.

718
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,475
Made you my guardians,

719
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,752
my depositories,

720
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,831
but kept a reservation

721
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,679
to be followed with such a number.

722
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,475
What, must I come to
you with five and twenty?

723
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,112
Regan, said you so?

724
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,231
And speak't again, my
lord. No more with me.

725
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,156
Those wicked creatures
yet do look well-favour'd

726
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,990
when others are more wicked.

727
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,031
Not being the worst stands
in some rank of praise.

728
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,032
I'll go with thee.

729
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,829
Thy fifty yet doth
double five and twenty.

730
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,793
And thou art twice her love.

731
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,353
Hear me, my lord.

732
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,069
What need you five and
twenty, ten, or five,

733
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,229
to follow in a house where twice
so many have a command to tend you?

734
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,552
What need one?

735
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,428
O, reason not the need!

736
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,157
Our basest beggars are in
the poorest thing superfluous.

737
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,199
Allow not nature more than nature needs,

738
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,353
man's life's as cheap as beast's.

739
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,638
Thou art a lady;

740
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,279
if only to go warm were gorgeous,

741
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,631
why, nature needs not
what thou gorgeous wear'st

742
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,796
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

743
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,310
But for true need...

744
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,589
O heavens, give me patience.

745
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,471
Patience I need.

746
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,437
You see me here, you gods,

747
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,634
a poor old man,

748
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,510
as full of grief as age;

749
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,797
wretched in both.

750
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,119
If it be you that stirs
these daughters' hearts

751
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,799
against their father,

752
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,231
fool me not so much to bear it tamely;

753
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,511
touch me with noble anger,

754
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:43,230
and let not women's weapons,
water-drops, stain my man's cheeks.

755
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,313
No, you unnatural hags!

756
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,632
I will have such revenges on you both,

757
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,751
that all the world shall...

758
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,274
I will do such things...

759
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:13,049
What they are yet I know not; but
they shall be the terrors of the earth.

760
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,592
You think I'll weep.

761
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,509
No, I'll not weep.

762
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,519
I have full cause of weeping;

763
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,835
but this heart shall break
into a hundred thousand flaws

764
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,471
or ere I'll weep.

765
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,154
O fool...

766
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,757
I shall go mad.

767
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,393
This house is little.

768
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,068
The old man and his people
cannot be well bestow'd.

769
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,633
'Tis his own blame.

770
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,836
Hath put himself from rest
and needs must taste his folly.

771
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,873
For his particular, I'll receive
him gladly, but not one follower.

772
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,239
So am I purpos'd.

773
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,751
Where's my Lord of Gloucester?

774
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,950
The King is in high rage.

775
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,994
To wilful men,

776
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,556
the injuries that they themselves
procure must be their schoolmasters.

777
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,032
Shut up your doors. He is
attended with a desperate train.

778
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,839
Shut up your doors, my lord.

779
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,393
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry
and take the fool with thee.

780
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:52,237
Blow, winds!

781
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,549
And crack your cheeks!

782
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,792
Rage.

783
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,435
Blow!

784
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,274
You cataracts and hurricanoes,

785
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,876
spout till you have
drenched our steeples,

786
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,397
drown'd the cocks.

787
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,391
You sulph'rous and
thought-executing fires,

788
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,195
vaunt couriers of
oak-cleaving thunderbolts,

789
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,311
singe my white head.

790
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,956
And thou, all-shaking thunder,

791
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,789
strike flat the thick
rotundity of the world;

792
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,389
crack nature's moulds,

793
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:44,196
all germens spill at once,
that make ingrateful man.

794
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,758
O nuncle, court holy water
in a dry house

795
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,712
is better than this
rain-water out o' doors.

796
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,313
Good nuncle, in; ask
thy daughters' blessing.

797
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,034
Here's a night pities
neither wise men nor fools.

798
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,231
Rumble thy belly full.

799
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,754
Spit, fire.

800
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,514
Spout, rain.

801
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,278
Nor rain, wind, thunder,
fire, are my daughters.

802
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,310
I tax not you, you
elements, with unkindness.

803
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,392
I never gave you kingdom,

804
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,158
call'd you children.

805
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,920
You owe me no subscription.

806
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,430
Then let fall your horrible pleasure.

807
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,754
Here I stand, your slave,

808
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,238
a poor, infirm, weak
and despis'd old man;

809
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,275
but yet I call you servile ministers

810
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,555
that will with two pernicious daughters
join your high-engender'd battles

811
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,876
'gainst a head so old and white as this.

812
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,315
O, ho, 'tis foul!

813
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,997
He who has a house to put
his head in has a good head-piece.

814
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,318
No, I will be the
pattern of all patience.

815
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,752
I will say nothing.

816
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,753
Who's there?

817
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,270
A wise man and a fool.

818
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,991
Let the great gods that keep this
dreadful pudder o'er our heads

819
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,077
find out their enemies now.

820
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,396
Tremble, thou wretch,
that hast within thee

821
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,717
undivulged crimes unwhipped of justice:

822
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,549
Caitiff, to pieces shake, that
under covert and convenient seeming

823
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,671
hast practis'd on man's life.

824
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,030
Close pent-up guilts,

825
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,595
rive your concealing continents,

826
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,712
and cry these dreadful summoners grace.

827
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,713
I am a man more sinn'd
against than sinning.

828
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,558
Gracious my lord,

829
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,512
hard by here is a hovel;

830
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,631
some friendship will it
lend you 'gainst the tempest.

831
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,030
My wits begin to turn.

832
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:02,875
Come on, my boy.

833
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,235
How dost thou, boy? Art cold?

834
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,510
Am cold myself. Where
is this straw, my fellow?

835
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,912
The art of our necessities is strange

836
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,588
and can make vile things precious.

837
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,678
Come, your hovel.

838
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,474
Poor fool and knave,

839
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,155
I have one part in my heart
that's sorry yet for thee.

840
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,957
<i>He that has and a little tiny wit</i>

841
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,277
<i>With a heigh-ho the wind And the rain</i>

842
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,714
<i>Must make content With his fortunes fit</i>

843
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,959
<i>Though the rain it raineth Every day</i>

844
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,749
My lord. Good my lord, enter.

845
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,268
Thou think'st 'tis much that this
contentious storm invades us...

846
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,152
to the skin; so 'tis to thee,

847
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,797
but where the greater malady is
fix'd, the lesser is scarce felt.

848
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,597
Thou'dst shun a bear;

849
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,036
but if thy flight lay toward the roaring
sea thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth.

850
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,793
When the mind's free,

851
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,870
the body is delicate.

852
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,629
This tempest in my mind

853
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,991
doth from my senses
take all feeling else,

854
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,758
save what beats there.

855
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,953
Filial ingratitude.

856
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,073
But I will punish home.
No, I'll weep no more.

857
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,150
In such a night, to shut me out!

858
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,797
Pour on;

859
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,150
I will endure!

860
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,157
Nay, get thee in.

861
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,353
I'll pray,

862
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,597
and then I'll sleep.

863
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,196
Poor naked wretches,

864
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,799
wheresoe'er you are,

865
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,037
that bide the pelting
of this pitiless storm,

866
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,071
how shall your houseless
heads and unfed sides,

867
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,840
your loop'd and window'd raggedness,

868
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,670
defend you from seasons such as these?

869
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,916
O, I have ta'en too little care of this!

870
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,316
Take physic, pomp;

871
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,271
expose thyself to feel
what wretches feel,

872
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,038
that thou mayst take
the superflux to them,

873
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,555
and show the heavens more just.

874
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:33,994
Go to thy bed and warm thee.

875
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:42,233
Did'st thou give all to thy
daughters? And art come to this?

876
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,353
Who gives anything to poor Tom?

877
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,671
Go you and talk to the Duke.

878
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,713
If he asks for me, I
am ill and gone to bed.

879
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,792
If I die for it, as no
less is threatened me,

880
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,072
the King, my old
master, must be relieved.

881
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,351
Pray you, be careful.

882
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,032
What hast thou been?

883
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:37,273
A serving-man, proud in heart and mind;

884
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:41,314
that curl'd my hair;
wore gloves in my cap;

885
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,795
serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart

886
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,150
and did the act of darkness with her;

887
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,399
swore as many oaths as I spake words,

888
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,549
and broke them in the
sweet face of heaven.

889
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,360
One that slept in the contriving
of lust, and wak'd to do it.

890
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,190
Wine lov'd I deeply, dice dearly;

891
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,039
and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.

892
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,118
False of heart,

893
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,232
light of ear, bloody of hand;

894
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:14,831
hog in sloth, fox in stealth,

895
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,352
wolf in greediness, dog in madness,

896
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,413
lion in prey.

897
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,519
Let not the creaking of shoes
nor the rustling of silks

898
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,439
betray thy poor heart to woman.

899
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,991
And defy the foul fiend.

900
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,158
Still through the hawthorn
blows the cold wind.

901
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,510
Thou wert better in a grave

902
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:46,032
than to answer with thy uncover'd
body this extremity of the skies.

903
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,235
Is man no more than this?

904
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,192
Consider him well.

905
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,875
Thou ow'st the worm no
silk, the beast no hide,

906
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,675
the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume.

907
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,269
Ha! Here's three on
us are sophisticated.

908
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,275
Thou art the thing itself.

909
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:21,510
Unaccommodated man is no more but
such a poor, bare, fork'd animal

910
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,194
as thou art.

911
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,153
Off, off, you lendings!

912
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,512
Come, unbutton here.

913
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,214
Who's there? Who's there?

914
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,512
What are your names?

915
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,154
Who's there?

916
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,872
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet!

917
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,150
Aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

918
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,158
The prince of darkness is a gentleman;

919
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,396
Modo he's called, and Mahu.

920
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,270
Poor Tom's a-cold.

921
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,354
Go with me. I will bring you where
both fire and food is ready.

922
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,597
Let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?

923
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,392
Good my lord, take his offer.

924
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,953
What is your study?

925
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,990
How to prevent the
fiend and to kill vermin.

926
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,397
Let me ask you one word in private.

927
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,717
Child Rowland to the dark tower came.

928
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,632
His word was still,

929
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:30,873
"Fie, foh, and fum, I smell
the blood of a British man. "

930
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,618
I will have revenge
ere I depart his house.

931
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,893
O heavens! That this
treason were not my father's,

932
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,373
and I not the detector of it.

933
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,854
Thou shalt find a
dearer father in my love.

934
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,375
This loyalty hath made
thee Earl of Gloucester.

935
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,050
You have mighty business in hand.

936
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,216
Seek out where thy father is,

937
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:10,820
that he may be ready
for our apprehension.

938
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:20,577
<i>Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me</i>

939
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,135
<i>Her boat hath a leak,
And she must not speak</i>

940
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,615
<i>Why dare she not come Over to thee</i>

941
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:28,812
The foul fiend haunts poor
Tom in the voice of a nightingale.

942
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:34,291
Hoppedance cries in Tom's
belly for two white herring.

943
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:39,932
Croak not, black angel;
I have no food for thee.

944
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,773
How do you, sir?

945
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,292
Stand you not so amaz'd.

946
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,297
Will you lie down and rest?

947
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,290
I'll see their trial first.

948
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,458
Bring in the evidence.

949
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:04,379
Thou robed man of
justice, take thy place.

950
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,697
Thou, his yoke-fellow of
equity, bench by his side.

951
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,658
You are o' th' commission, sit you too.

952
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,359
Let us deal justly.

953
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,178
Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?

954
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:17,531
Thy sheep be in the corn; and
for one blast of thy minikin mouth

955
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:19,617
thy sheep shall take no harm.

956
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,378
Purr! The cat is grey.

957
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,730
Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril.

958
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:27,569
I take my oath before this assembly,
she kick'd the poor King, her father.

959
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,657
Come hither, mistress.
Is your name Goneril?

960
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:30,815
She cannot deny it.

961
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,976
Cry you mercy, I took
you for a joint-stool.

962
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,819
And here's another whose
warp'd looks proclaim

963
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,170
what stone her heart is made on. Stop!

964
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:41,497
Stop her there! Arms, arms, sword, fire!

965
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,295
Corruption in the place! False
justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

966
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:49,288
O pity! Sir, where is the patience now
that you so oft have boasted to retain?

967
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:57,017
The dogs and all, Tray, Blanch and
Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.

968
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:00,496
Tom will throw his head
at them. Avaunt, you curs!

969
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,418
For, with throwing thus my head,

970
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,817
dogs leapt the hatch and all are fled.

971
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,976
Sessa.

972
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:12,376
Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.

973
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:24,052
Then let them anatomize Regan;

974
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,809
see what breeds about her heart.

975
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,815
Is there any cause in nature
that makes these hard hearts?

976
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,136
Now, good my lord, lie
here and rest awhile.

977
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:06,659
You, sir, I entertain
to be one of my hundred;

978
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,773
only I don't like the
fashion of your garments.

979
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,777
You may say they are Persian,

980
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,330
but let them be chang'd.

981
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,093
Oppressed nature sleeps.

982
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,456
Drive toward Dover, friend.

983
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:38,049
I have o'erheard a
plot of death upon him.

984
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:42,378
From France there comes a
power landed at our best ports.

985
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:45,936
Thou shalt receive both
welcome and protection.

986
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,139
Good my friends;

987
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,213
do me no foul play, friends.

988
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:22,335
The army of France is landed. Post
speedily to my lord your husband.

989
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,338
Advise him to a most sudden preparation.
We are bound to do the like.

990
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,656
Edmund, keep you our sister company.

991
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:31,015
How now? Where's the traitor Gloucester?

992
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,290
Bound fast and pinioned like a thief.

993
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,810
Hang him instantly. Pluck out his eyes.

994
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:40,135
Leave him to my displeasure.

995
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,855
Farewell, my Lord of Gloucester.

996
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,534
The revenges we are bound to
take upon your traitorous father

997
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,776
are not fit for your beholding.

998
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,859
Farewell, dear sister.

999
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,418
Ingrateful fox!

1000
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,771
O filthy traitor.

1001
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,172
What means your Graces?

1002
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,616
Good my friends, consider
you are my guests.

1003
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,212
To this chair bind him.

1004
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,452
I am your host.

1005
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,059
What will you do?

1006
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:17,454
Come, sir, what letters
had you late from France?

1007
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,856
To whose hands have you
sent the lunatic King?

1008
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,654
Speak.

1009
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,816
Be simple-answer'd,
for we know the truth.

1010
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,533
Where hast thou sent the King?

1011
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,659
To Dover.

1012
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,169
Wherefore to Dover?
Was thou not charged...?

1013
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:34,254
Wherefore to Dover?

1014
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,172
Let him answer that.

1015
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,538
Wherefore to Dover?

1016
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:44,575
Because I would not see thy cruel
nails pluck out his poor old eyes.

1017
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,779
See it shalt thou never.

1018
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,259
One side will mock
another; th' other too.

1019
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:18,850
Out, vile jelly!

1020
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:28,653
My lord, I have served you ever
since I was a boy, but now out!

1021
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,735
All dark and comfortless!

1022
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,779
Edmund.

1023
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:10,619
Thou call'st on him that hates thee.

1024
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:13,732
It was he that made the
discovery of thy treason to us;

1025
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,290
who is too good to pity thee.

1026
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,854
Regan, give me your arm.

1027
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,254
I bleed.

1028
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,738
Throw him on a dunghill.

1029
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,739
World, world, O world!

1030
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,250
But that thy strange
mutations make us hate thee,

1031
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,212
life would not yield to age.

1032
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:44,773
Tom's a-cold.

1033
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,891
Is that the naked fellow?

1034
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,330
Ay, my lord. Come hither.

1035
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:56,616
Know'st thou the way
to Dover? Ay, master.

1036
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:23,019
As flies to wanton boys
are we to th' gods.

1037
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,734
They kill us for their sport.

1038
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,809
Spare speech. Decline your head;

1039
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,612
this kiss, if it durst speak,

1040
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,856
would stretch thy
spirits up into the air.

1041
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,893
Yours in the ranks of death.

1042
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,897
My most dear Gloucester.

1043
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,730
O, the difference of man and man!

1044
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:04,295
To thee a woman's services are due.

1045
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,170
A fool usurps my bed.

1046
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,454
I have been worth the whistle.

1047
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,812
O Goneril.

1048
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:18,410
You are not worth the dust which
the rude wind blows in your face.

1049
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,614
I fear your disposition.

1050
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,617
No more; the text is foolish.

1051
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:24,094
What have you done?

1052
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,733
Tigers, not daughters,

1053
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,452
what have you perform'd?

1054
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:31,537
Most barbarous and degenerate,

1055
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,378
you maddened a father

1056
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,738
and a gracious aged man.

1057
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:41,299
Humanity perforce doth prey upon itself,

1058
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,734
like monsters of the deep.

1059
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,615
Milk-liver'd man! Where's thy drum?

1060
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,014
France spreads his banners in our land,

1061
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,132
whil'st thou, a moral fool,

1062
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:56,537
sits still and cries,
"Alack, why does he so?"

1063
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:00,055
See yourself, devil!

1064
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:02,490
O vain fool!

1065
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:06,737
Were I of a fitness to let
these hands obey my blood,

1066
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:10,137
they are apt enough to dislocate
and tear thy flesh and bones.

1067
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,490
Marry, your manhood...

1068
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:16,256
Mew!

1069
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:40,252
The gods are just,

1070
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:47,853
and of our present vices
make instruments to plague us.

1071
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,690
The dark and vicious place

1072
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:54,456
where thee he got

1073
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,569
cost him his eyes.

1074
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,373
Make no noise, make no noise;

1075
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:47,218
draw the curtains. So, so.

1076
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,337
We'll go to supper i' th' morning.

1077
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,735
And I'll go to bed at noon.

1078
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,577
There is a cliff looks
fearfully on the deep:

1079
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,294
Bring me to the very brim of it.

1080
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,209
From that place I shall no leading need.

1081
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:29,853
Come on, sir.

1082
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:38,177
When shall I get to the top
of that same hill?

1083
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,656
You do climb up it now;
look how we labour.

1084
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,055
Methinks the ground is even.

1085
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,659
Horrible steep.

1086
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,696
Come on, sir;

1087
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,774
here's the place.

1088
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:18,494
Stand still.

1089
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,931
How fearful and dizzy 'tis
to cast one's eyes so low!

1090
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,974
The crows and choughs
that wing the midway air

1091
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:28,455
show scarce so gross as beetles.

1092
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,570
The fishermen that walk upon
the beach appear like mice;

1093
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:37,689
and yond tall anchoring bark,

1094
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,136
almost too small for sight.

1095
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:47,335
The murmuring surge that on the
unnumb'red idle pebble chafes

1096
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,176
cannot be heard so high.

1097
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,978
I'll look no more;

1098
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:57,855
lest my brain turn, and the
deficient sight topple down headlong.

1099
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,531
Set me where you stand.

1100
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:04,336
Give me your hand.

1101
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,337
You are now within a
foot of th' extreme verge.

1102
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:16,134
For all beneath the moon
would I not leap upright.

1103
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,453
Let go my hand.

1104
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:24,378
Bid me farewell,

1105
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:28,217
and let me hear thee going.

1106
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,576
Now fare ye well, good sir.

1107
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:40,657
With all my heart.

1108
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,694
Now, fellow, fare thee well.

1109
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:49,090
O you mighty gods!

1110
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:51,936
This world I do renounce,

1111
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,691
and in your sights,

1112
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:58,895
shake patiently my great affliction off.

1113
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:02,016
If I could bear it further,

1114
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:08,133
and not fall to quarrel with
your great opposeless wills,

1115
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:13,816
my snuff and loathed part of nature

1116
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:16,011
should burn itself out.

1117
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:21,572
If Edgar live, O, bless him!

1118
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:53,414
Ho, you sir! Friend!

1119
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,899
Hear you, sir!

1120
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:58,452
Speak! What are you, sir?

1121
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:02,016
Away, and let me die.

1122
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:07,051
Hadst thou been aught but
gossamer, feathers, air,

1123
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,931
thou'dst shiver'd like an egg;

1124
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:15,570
but thou dost breathe, bleed'st
not, speak'st, art sound.

1125
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:19,773
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.

1126
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,972
But have I fall'n, or no?

1127
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:26,456
From the dread summit
of this chalky bourn.

1128
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,139
Look up a-height;

1129
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:32,697
the shrill-gorg'd lark so
far cannot be seen or heard.

1130
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,174
Do but look up.

1131
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,848
Alack, I have no eyes.

1132
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:43,090
Is wretchedness depriv'd that
benefit, to end itself by death?

1133
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,250
Give me your arm. Up,

1134
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:51,254
so.

1135
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:54,334
How is't?

1136
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,739
Feel you your legs?

1137
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:58,852
You stand.

1138
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,173
Too well, too well.

1139
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:06,331
This is above all strangeness.

1140
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,816
Upon the crown of the cliff,

1141
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:13,499
what thing was that
which parted from you?

1142
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,850
A poor unfortunate beggar.

1143
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:20,696
It was some fiend.

1144
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,170
Thou happy father,

1145
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:28,129
think that the clearest gods,

1146
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:32,379
who make them honours
of men's impossibilities,

1147
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,218
have preserved thee.

1148
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:41,291
I do remember now.

1149
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:45,048
Henceforth, I'll bear affliction

1150
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,376
till it do cry out itself,

1151
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:51,255
"Enough, enough," and die.

1152
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:56,733
See, that thing you speak
of, I took it for a man.

1153
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:02,413
Bear free and patient thoughts.

1154
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,972
Now, good sir, what are you?

1155
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:19,936
A most poor man,

1156
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:24,289
made tame to fortune's blows,

1157
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:30,258
who by the art of known
and feeling sorrows

1158
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,531
am pregnant to good pity.

1159
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,212
Give the word.

1160
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:43,818
Sweet marjoram.

1161
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,094
Pass.

1162
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:54,171
Ha! Goneril with a white beard!

1163
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:01,695
They flatter'd me like a dog.

1164
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:05,256
They told me I had the
white hairs in my beard

1165
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,257
ere the black ones were there.

1166
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:12,935
To say "ay" and "no" to
everything that I said!

1167
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:18,257
"Ay" and "no" too was no good divinity.

1168
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:24,136
When the rain came to wet me once

1169
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:27,217
and the wind to make me chatter;

1170
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:31,612
when the thunder would
not peace at my bidding;

1171
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:34,618
there I found 'em,
there I smelt 'em out.

1172
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,253
Go to, they are not men of their word.

1173
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:39,213
They told me I was everything.

1174
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:42,653
It's a lie.

1175
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:46,136
I am not ague-proof.

1176
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:50,652
The trick of that voice I do
well remember. Is't not the King?

1177
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:55,058
Ay, every inch a king.

1178
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:59,777
When I do stare, see
how the subject quakes.

1179
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,810
I pardon that man's life.
What was thy cause? Adultery?

1180
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,533
Thou shall not die.

1181
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,731
Die for adultery? No.

1182
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:10,498
The wren goes to't,

1183
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:14,488
and the small gilded fly
does lecher in my sight.

1184
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:17,260
Let copulation thrive!

1185
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:21,813
Gloucester's bastard son
was kinder to his father

1186
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:25,217
than my daughters got
betwixt the lawful sheets.

1187
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:30,370
To't, luxury, pell-mell,
for I lack soldiers.

1188
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:36,457
Give me an ounce of
civet, good apothecary.

1189
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,773
Sweeten my imagination.

1190
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,818
There's money for thee.

1191
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,490
O, let me kiss that hand!

1192
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:48,657
Let me wipe it first;

1193
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:52,649
it smells of mortality.

1194
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:01,050
O ruin'd piece of nature!

1195
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:05,775
This great world shall
so wear out to nought.

1196
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:10,659
Dost thou know me?

1197
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:16,135
I remember thine eyes well enough.

1198
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,137
Dost thou squiny at me?

1199
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:27,049
No, do thy worst, blind
Cupid. I'll not love.

1200
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,417
Read thou this challenge;

1201
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,451
mark but the penning of it.

1202
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:37,732
Were all thy letters
suns, I could not see.

1203
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,373
Read.

1204
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:42,219
What, with a case of eyes?

1205
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:46,459
O, ho, are you there with me?

1206
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,934
No eyes in your head nor
no money in your purse?

1207
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,974
Your eyes are in a heavy
case, your purse in a light;

1208
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:58,575
yet you see how this world goes.

1209
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:02,011
I see it feelingly.

1210
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:05,334
What, art mad?

1211
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:11,370
A man may see how the
world goes with no eyes.

1212
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,213
Look with thine ears.

1213
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:19,213
Behold yond justice rail on yond
simple thief. Hark in thine ear:

1214
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:21,809
Change places and, handy-dandy,

1215
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:24,659
which is the justice,
which is the thief? Ey?

1216
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:29,651
Thou hast seen the farmer's
dog bark at a beggar?

1217
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:31,134
Ay, sir.

1218
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,490
Yea, and the creature run from the cur?

1219
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:37,693
There thou mightst behold
the great image of authority:

1220
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:40,334
A dog's obeyed in office.

1221
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:47,089
Thou rascal beadle,
hold thy bloody hand.

1222
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:50,095
Why dost thou lash that whore?

1223
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,009
Strip thine own back;

1224
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:58,576
thou hotly lusts to use her in that
kind for which thou whip'st her.

1225
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:08,413
The usurer hangs the cozener.

1226
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:13,179
Through tatter'd clothes
great vices do appear.

1227
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:17,138
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all.

1228
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:25,258
Plate sin with gold, and the strong
lance of justice hurtless breaks.

1229
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:29,248
Arm it in rags, a pygmy's
straw does pierce it.

1230
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:33,979
None does offend.

1231
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:37,254
None.

1232
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:40,852
I say none.

1233
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:44,098
I'll able 'em.

1234
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:48,250
Take that of me, my friend, who have
the power to seal th' accuser's lips.

1235
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:51,372
Get thee glass eyes and,
like a scurvy politician,

1236
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:54,174
seem to see the things thou dost not.

1237
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:56,018
Now, now, now, now!

1238
01:44:57,020 --> 01:44:59,488
Here, pull off my boots.

1239
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:21,336
If thou wilt weep my fortunes,

1240
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,573
take my eyes.

1241
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:30,738
I know thee well enough;
thy name is Gloucester.

1242
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:35,090
Thou must be patient.

1243
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:40,100
We came crying hither.

1244
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:43,778
Thou know'st the first
time that we smell the air,

1245
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:46,096
we wawl and cry.

1246
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:49,977
I'll preach to thee. Mark.

1247
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:52,489
Alack, alack the day!

1248
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:55,695
When we are born, we cry

1249
01:45:56,740 --> 01:46:01,609
that we are come to this
great stage of fools.

1250
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,893
This a good block.

1251
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:09,695
It were a delicate stratagem to
shoe a troop of horse with felt;

1252
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:14,655
I'll put it to the proof; and when
I have stolen upon these son-in-laws,

1253
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:19,980
then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

1254
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,697
Sir, your most dear daughter...

1255
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:29,174
No rescue?

1256
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,255
What, a prisoner?

1257
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:37,217
I am even the natural fool of fortune.

1258
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:41,174
Use me well; you shall have ransom.

1259
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:48,176
Let me have surgeons;
I am cut to th' brains.

1260
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:50,018
You shall have anything.

1261
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:53,656
No seconds? All myself?

1262
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:58,858
Why, this would make
a man a man of salt,

1263
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:02,336
to use his eyes for garden water-pots,

1264
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:05,816
ay, and laying Autumn's dust.

1265
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:09,093
I will die bravely,

1266
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:11,412
like a smug bridegroom.

1267
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:13,451
What! I will be jovial.

1268
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:17,938
Come, come; I am a king,
masters, know you that.

1269
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:21,257
You are a royal one, and we obey you.

1270
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:26,097
Then there's life in't.

1271
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:30,298
Come, an you get it.

1272
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:37,488
You shall get it by
running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.

1273
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,531
Come on, come on, come on!

1274
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:21,495
Ask of the Duke if
his last purpose hold,

1275
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:24,210
or whether since he's
changed his course.

1276
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:29,053
He's full of alteration.

1277
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:32,853
Our very loving sister, well be-met.

1278
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,772
Sir, you speak nobly.

1279
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:40,174
Where I could not be honest,
I never yet was valiant.

1280
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:44,815
For this war, it touches us
as France invades this land,

1281
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:47,258
not as regards the King,

1282
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:50,130
whose cause is just and heavy.

1283
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,618
Why is this reason'd?

1284
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,255
The enemy's in view;
draw up your powers.

1285
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:59,212
Combine together 'gainst the enemy;

1286
01:48:59,420 --> 01:49:02,253
for these particular broils
are not the question here.

1287
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,655
Then let's determine on our proceeding.

1288
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:06,851
I shall attend you
presently at your tent.

1289
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:17,897
Now, sweet lord, tell me,

1290
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:21,574
but truly,

1291
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:25,052
but then speak the truth,

1292
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:28,816
do you not love my sister?

1293
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:30,976
In honour'd love.

1294
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:36,613
But have you never found my
brother's way to the forfended place?

1295
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,378
That thought abuses you.

1296
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:42,018
I never shall endure her.

1297
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:47,288
Dear my lord, be not familiar with her.

1298
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:54,378
Fear me not.

1299
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,374
Oswald.

1300
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,769
Ho!

1301
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:49,218
"If he return the conqueror,

1302
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:53,050
"then am I the prisoner,

1303
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:56,136
"and his bed my gaol;

1304
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:02,376
"from the loathed warmth
whereof deliver me,

1305
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:06,573
"and supply the place for your labour. "

1306
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,777
I had rather lose the battle

1307
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:36,494
than that sister should
loosen him and me.

1308
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:42,730
She being widow, and
my Gloucester with her,

1309
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:48,775
may all the building in my
fancy pluck upon my hateful life.

1310
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:08,215
A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!

1311
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:12,698
That eyeless head of thine was first
fram'd flesh to raise my fortune.

1312
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,494
Come not near the old
man. Let go his arm.

1313
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:18,533
I'll not let go! Out, dunghill!

1314
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:22,892
Thou old unhappy traitor,
briefly thyself remember.

1315
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:03,813
How does my royal lord?

1316
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:07,539
How fares your Majesty?

1317
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:23,131
You do me wrong to take
me out o' th' grave.

1318
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:29,015
Thou art a soul in bliss;

1319
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:35,179
but I am bound upon a wheel of fire,

1320
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:42,378
that mine own tears do
scald like molten lead.

1321
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:44,534
Sir,

1322
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:46,694
do you know me?

1323
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:49,850
You are a spirit, I know.

1324
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:53,134
When did you die?

1325
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:56,294
Still far wide.

1326
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:59,492
He's scarce awake;
let him alone awhile.

1327
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:04,734
Where have I been?

1328
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,374
Where am I?

1329
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:15,219
In your own kingdom, sir.

1330
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:20,974
Pray, do not mock me;

1331
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:27,938
I am a very foolish fond old man,

1332
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,252
fourscore and upward,

1333
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,897
not an hour more nor less.

1334
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:37,934
And, to deal plainly,

1335
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:43,490
I fear that I'm not in my perfect mind.

1336
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:50,888
Methinks I should know you,

1337
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,374
and know this man,

1338
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,337
but I am doubtful;

1339
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:02,658
for I am mainly ignorant
what place this is.

1340
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:09,499
All the skill I have
remembers not these garments,

1341
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:12,175
nor do I know where I
did lodge last night.

1342
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:16,294
Do not laugh at me;

1343
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,938
for as I am a man,

1344
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,499
I think this lady

1345
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:27,975
to be my child Cordelia.

1346
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,659
And so I am.

1347
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:33,174
I am.

1348
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:39,458
Be your tears wet?

1349
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:43,014
Yes, faith.

1350
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:47,818
I know you do not love me;

1351
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:53,376
for your sisters have, as I
do remember, done me wrong.

1352
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:56,936
You have some cause. They have not.

1353
01:55:57,140 --> 01:56:00,337
No cause, no cause.

1354
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:02,098
You must bear with me.

1355
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,774
Pray you now,

1356
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,811
forget and forgive;

1357
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,654
I am old

1358
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:11,454
and foolish.

1359
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:50,219
Away, old man.
King Lear has lost.

1360
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:54,575
No further, sir; a man
may rot even here.

1361
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:58,139
What, in ill thoughts again?

1362
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:00,775
Men must endure their going hence,

1363
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:02,974
even as their coming hither.

1364
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:05,574
Ripeness is all.

1365
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,576
And that's true too.

1366
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:57,259
Shall we not see these
daughters and these sisters?

1367
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:00,454
No.

1368
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:04,254
No, no, no.

1369
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:12,218
Come, let's away to prison.

1370
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:20,930
We two alone will sing
like birds i' th' cage.

1371
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:24,332
When thou dost ask me blessing,

1372
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:29,898
I'll kneel down and
ask of thee forgiveness.

1373
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:36,492
And so we'll live, and pray,

1374
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,974
and sing,

1375
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:40,419
and tell old tales,

1376
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:44,089
and laugh at gilded butterflies,

1377
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,778
and we'll hear poor
rogues talk of court news;

1378
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,138
and we'll talk with them too,

1379
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:55,412
who loses and who wins;

1380
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:58,092
who's in, who's out,

1381
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:02,092
and take upon us the mystery of things

1382
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:05,053
as if we were God's spies.

1383
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:12,928
And we'll wear out in a walled prison

1384
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:15,217
packs and sects of great ones

1385
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:17,256
that ebb and flow by th' moon.

1386
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:20,094
Take them away.

1387
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,574
Have I caught thee?

1388
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:26,177
He that parts us shall
bring a brand from heaven

1389
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:28,450
and fire us hence like foxes.

1390
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:32,574
Wipe thine eyes;

1391
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,531
the good years shall devour them,

1392
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:39,015
flesh and fell, ere
they shall make us weep.

1393
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:42,610
Take them away! We'll
see 'em starv'd first.

1394
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:44,454
Come hither, Captain.

1395
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:50,734
Hark. Take thou this note;

1396
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:54,054
go follow them to prison.

1397
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:57,733
Know thou this:

1398
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:00,577
Men are as the time is;

1399
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:04,698
to be tender-hearted
does not become a sword.

1400
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:47,531
Sir, you have showed
to-day your valiant strain,

1401
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,514
and fortune led you well.

1402
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:52,009
You have the captives;
I do require them of you.

1403
02:00:52,220 --> 02:00:55,929
The question of Cordelia and her
father requires a fitter place.

1404
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:58,094
Sir, by your patience,

1405
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:01,410
I hold you but a subject in this war,

1406
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,254
not as a brother.

1407
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:07,776
That's as we list to grace him.

1408
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:13,410
Methinks our pleasure might have been
demanded ere you had spoke so far.

1409
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,453
He led our powers.

1410
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:19,175
In his own grace he doth exalt
himself, more than in your addition.

1411
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:24,139
In my rights, by me invested,
he compeers the best.

1412
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:29,094
That were the most, if
he should husband you.

1413
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:32,809
Jesters do oft prove prophets.

1414
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:04,931
Ask him his purposes.

1415
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:08,014
What are you?

1416
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,900
Your name, your quality?

1417
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:15,536
I am as noble as the
adversary I come to cope.

1418
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,219
Which is that adversary?

1419
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:20,493
He that speaks for
Edmund, Earl of Gloucester.

1420
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:34,138
In wisdom I should ask your name.

1421
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:40,535
Know that my name is lost.

1422
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:57,858
The wheel is come full circle;

1423
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:02,654
I am here.

1424
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,814
Read.

1425
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:22,613
Know'st thou this paper?

1426
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:29,011
Ask me not what I know.

1427
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:42,129
Howl!

1428
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:53,057
Howl!

1429
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:16,574
O, you are men of stones!

1430
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:20,255
Had I your tongues and eyes,

1431
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:25,488
I'd use them so that
heaven's vault should crack.

1432
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:34,093
She's gone for ever.

1433
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:39,576
I know when one is dead,

1434
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:42,698
and when one lives.

1435
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:49,378
She's dead as earth.

1436
02:06:57,940 --> 02:06:59,658
This feather stirs;

1437
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:02,694
she lives.

1438
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:07,530
If it be so, it is a chance
which does redeem all sorrows

1439
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:09,571
that ever I have felt.

1440
02:07:10,660 --> 02:07:12,855
Is this the promis'd end?

1441
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:15,779
Or image of that horror?

1442
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:20,053
A plague upon you,
murderers, traitors all!

1443
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:26,976
I might have sav'd her;

1444
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:32,370
now she's gone for ever.

1445
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:35,974
Cordelia,

1446
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:39,494
Cordelia,

1447
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:43,296
stay a little.

1448
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:47,059
What is't thou say'st?

1449
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:53,938
Her voice was ever soft,

1450
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:56,253
gentle and low,

1451
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:00,296
an excellent thing in woman.

1452
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,860
I kill'd the slave
that was a-hanging thee.

1453
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:09,292
Did I not, fellow?

1454
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:15,614
Who are you?

1455
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:19,619
Mine eyes are not of the
best, I'll tell you straight.

1456
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:22,578
Are you not Kent?

1457
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:25,613
The same, your servant Kent.

1458
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:29,498
He's dead and rotten. No, my good lord;

1459
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:31,734
I am the very man

1460
02:08:31,940 --> 02:08:33,498
I'll see that straight.

1461
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:38,330
That from your first of difference
and decay have follow'd your sad steps.

1462
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:45,492
You are welcome hither.

1463
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:50,973
Nor no man else.

1464
02:08:52,580 --> 02:08:55,253
And my poor fool is hang'd.

1465
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:00,334
No,

1466
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:04,412
no, no life!

1467
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:11,769
Why should a dog, a
horse, a rat have life,

1468
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:14,890
and thou no breath at all?

1469
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:20,816
Thou'It come no more,

1470
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:24,334
never, never,

1471
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:30,458
never, never, never.

1472
02:09:37,460 --> 02:09:39,212
O, do you see this?

1473
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:43,814
Look on her.

1474
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:49,938
Look, her lips.

1475
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:53,774
Look there,

1476
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:57,054
look there!

1477
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:33,054
- Look up, my lord.
- Vex not his ghost.

1478
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:34,534
O, let him pass.

1479
02:10:35,380 --> 02:10:39,339
He hates him that would upon the rack
of this world stretch him out longer.

1480
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,258
Friends of my soul,

1481
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:54,096
you twain rule in this realm
and the gor'd state sustain.

1482
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:59,219
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.

1483
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:01,814
My master calls me;

1484
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:04,692
I must not say no.

1485
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:10,894
The weight of this
sad time we must obey.

1486
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:16,412
Speak what we feel, not
what we ought to say.

1487
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:21,618
The oldest hath borne most.

1488
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:25,531
We that are young

1489
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:28,413
shall never see so much

1490
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:31,458
nor live so long.
