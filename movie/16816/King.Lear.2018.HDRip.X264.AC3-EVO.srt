1
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,279
I thought the King had more affected
the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.

2
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,759
It did always seem so to us, but
now, in the division of the kingdom,

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,399
it appears not which of the dukes
he values most.

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,279
Equalities are so weighed

5
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,519
that curiosity in neither can make
choice of either's moiety.

6
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,760
Is not this your son, my lord?

7
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,519
His breeding, sir,
hath been at my charge.

8
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,039
I've so often blushed
to acknowledge him
that now I am brazed to it.

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,039
I cannot conceive you.

10
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,519
Sir, this young fellow's
mother could.

11
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,519
Though this knave came something
saucily into the world,

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,519
there was good sport at his making

13
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,039
and the whoreson
must be acknowledged.

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,839
Do you know this noble gentleman,
Edmund? <font color="cyan">No, my lord.</font>

15
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,679
My lord of Kent. Remember him
hereafter as my honourable friend.

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,040
He hath been out nine years
and away he shall again.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
The King is coming.

18
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,520
Attend the lords of France
and Burgundy, Gloucester.

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,119
Ay, my good lord.

20
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,039
Meantime, we shall express
our darker purpose.

21
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Give me the map there.

22
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,519
Know that we have divided
in three our kingdom.

23
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,559
'Tis our fast intent to shake all
cares and business from our age,

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,959
conferring them on younger strengths

25
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,040
while we unburden'd
crawl toward death.

26
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,719
Our son of Cornwall, and you,
our no less loving son of Albany,

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,279
we have this hour
a constant will to publish

28
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,519
our daughters' several dowers,

29
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,280
that future strife
may be prevented now.

30
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,479
The princes, France and Burgundy,

31
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,559
great rivals in our
youngest daughter's love,

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,759
long in our court have made
their amorous sojourn,

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,919
and here are to be answer'd.

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,519
Tell me, my daughters, since now
we will divest us both of rule,

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,159
interest of territory,
cares of state,

36
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,039
which of you shall we say
doth love us most?

37
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,519
That we our largest bounty
may extend

38
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,319
where nature doth
with merit challenge.

39
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,280
Goneril, our eldest-born,
speak first.

40
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,039
Sir, I love you more than words
can wield the matter,

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,759
dearer than eye-sight,

42
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,519
space and liberty,

43
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,679
beyond what can be valued,
rich or rare.

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,519
No less than life, with grace,
health, beauty, honour,

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,759
as much as child e'er loved,

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,400
or father found.

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,040
A love that makes breath poor
and speech unable.

48
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Beyond all manner of so much
I love you.

49
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,759
Of all these bounds,

50
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,039
even from this line to this,

51
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,199
with shadowy forests
and with champains rich'd,

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,479
with plenteous rivers
and wide-skirted meads,

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,519
we make thee lady.

54
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,960
To thine and Albany's issue...

55
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,919
..be this perpetual.

56
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,519
What says our second daughter,

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,960
our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall?

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,080
Speak.

59
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,279
I am made of that self-metal
as my sister

60
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,519
and prize me at her worth.

61
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,759
In my true heart, I find she
names my very deed of love,

62
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,039
only she comes too short.

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,519
That I profess myself an enemy
to all other joys,

64
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,759
which the most precious square
of sense possesses,

65
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,520
and find I am alone felicitate
in your dear Highness' love.

66
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,519
To thee and thine hereditary ever
remain this ample third

67
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,039
of our fair kingdom -
no less in space, validity

68
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,520
and pleasure,
than that conferr'd on Goneril.

69
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,279
Now, our joy,

70
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,039
although the last, not least,
to whose young love

71
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,760
the vines of France and milk of
Burgundy strive to be interess'd...

72
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,760
..what can you say to draw a third
more opulent than your sisters?

73
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
Speak.

74
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,800
Nothing, my lord.

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,519
Nothing!

76
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,039
Nothing.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,519
Nothing will come of nothing.

78
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,320
Speak again.

79
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,680
Unhappy that I am, I cannot
heave my heart into my mouth.

80
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
I love Your Majesty according
to my bond. No more, nor less.

81
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,279
How, now, Cordelia,
mend your speech a little,

82
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,279
lest you may mar your fortunes.

83
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,040
Ay, my good lord, you have
begot me, bred me, loved me.

84
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,559
I return those duties back
as are right fit -

85
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,760
obey you, love you
and most honour you.

86
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Why have my sisters husbands
if they say they love you all?

87
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,480
Sure, I shall never marry like my
sisters, to love my father all.

88
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,520
But goes thy heart with this?

89
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
Ay, good my lord.

90
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,759
So young and so untender?

91
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,039
So young, my lord, and true.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,039
Let it be so.
Thy truth, then, be thy dower.

93
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,559
Here I disclaim
all my paternal care,

94
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,519
and there's a stranger to my heart
and me hold thee from this for ever.

95
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,039
Good, my liege...

96
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,999
Peace, Kent! Come not between
the dragon and his wrath.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,639
I loved her most and thought to
set my rest on her kind nursery.

98
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,760
Hence, and avoid my sight!

99
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Call France! Who stirs?
Call Burgundy!

100
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,039
Cornwall and Albany,
with my two daughters' dowers,
digest this third.

101
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,759
Let pride, which she calls
plainness,

102
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,240
marry her.

103
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,039
I do invest you jointly
with my power, pre-eminence,

104
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,040
and all the large effects
that troop with majesty.

105
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,240
Ourself, by monthly course,
with reservation of...

106
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,639
..an hundred knights,
by you to be sustain'd,

107
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,039
shall our abode make with you
by due turns.

108
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Only we still retain the name...

109
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,239
..and all the additions to a king.

110
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,519
The sway, revenue, execution of
the rest. Beloved sons, be yours.

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,519
Royal Lear, whom I have ever
honour'd as my king,

112
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,519
as my great patron
thought on in my prayers...

113
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,439
The bow is bent and drawn,
make from the shaft.

114
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,039
Let it fall rather, though the fork
invade the region of my heart.

115
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,919
Be Kent unmannerly,
when Lear is mad.

116
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,039
What wilt thou do, old man?

117
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,759
Think'st thou that duty shall
have dread to speak
when power to flattery bows?

118
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,759
Kent, on thy life, no more.

119
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,039
My life I never held but as a pawn
to wage against thy enemies.

120
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,279
<font color="cyan">Out of my sight!
</font>Dear sir, forbear.

121
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,919
<font color="lime">See better, Lear.</font> Now, by Apollo...

122
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,039
Now, by Apollo, King?
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

123
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,399
I'll tell thee, thou dost evil!

124
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,279
Hear me, recreant.

125
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,040
On thine allegiance, hear me!

126
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,519
Thou hast sought to make us break
our vows, which we durst never yet.

127
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,519
Our potency made good,
take thy reward.

128
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,519
Five days we do allot thee

129
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,039
for provision to shield
thee from diseases of the world,

130
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,519
and on the sixth to turn thy
hated back upon our kingdom.

131
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,759
If, on the tenth day following,
thy banish'd trunk be found

132
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,519
in our dominions,
the moment is thy death.

133
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,319
Away, by Jupiter!

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,640
This shall not be revoked!

135
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,480
Here's France and Burgundy,
my noble lord.

136
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,280
My noble lord.

137
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,519
My lord of Burgundy.

138
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,519
We first address towards you,

139
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,279
who with this king hath
rivall'd for our daughter,

140
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,519
what in the least will you require
in present dower with her

141
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,519
or cease your quest of love?

142
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,839
Most Royal Majesty, I crave no more
than hath Your Highness offer'd,

143
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,759
nor will you tender less.

144
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,039
Right noble Burgundy, when she was
dear to us, we did hold her so,

145
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,759
but now her price is fall'n.

146
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,519
Sir, there she stands.

147
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,519
If aught within that little seeming
substance, or all of it,

148
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,039
with our displeasure pieced,
and nothing more,

149
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,520
may fitly like your grace,
she's there, she is yours.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,759
I know no answer.

151
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,279
Will you, with those
infirmities she owes,

152
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,519
unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
dower'd with our curse

153
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,759
and stranger'd with our oath,
take her or leave her?

154
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,039
Pardon me, royal sir, election
makes not up in such conditions.

155
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,759
Then leave her, sir,

156
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,039
for, by the power that made me,
I tell you all her wealth.

157
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,519
For you, great king,

158
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,759
I would not from your love make such
a stray to match you where I hate...

159
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,039
I yet beseech Your Majesty, that you
make it known it is no vicious blot,

160
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,759
murder or foulness, no unchaste
action or dishonour'd step,

161
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,760
that hath deprived me
of your grace and favour.

162
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,760
Better thou hadst not been born...

163
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,000
..than not to have pleased me
better.

164
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,800
My lord of Burgundy, what say you
to the lady? Will you have her?

165
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,519
Give but that portion
which yourself proposed

166
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,519
and I will make Cordelia
Duchess of Burgundy.

167
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,960
Nothing. I have sworn, I am firm.

168
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,039
I am sorry, then.

169
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,599
You have so lost a father

170
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,040
that you must lose a husband.

171
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,760
Peace be with Burgundy.

172
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,840
Since that respects and fortunes are
his love, I shall not be his wife.

173
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,039
Fairest Cordelia...

174
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,879
thee and thy virtues
here I seize upon.

175
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,759
Thou hast her, king.

176
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,519
Let her be thine...

177
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,759
for we have no such daughter,

178
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,719
nor shall ever see
that face of hers again.

179
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,600
Therefore be gone without
our grace, our love...

180
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,520
..our benison.

181
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,040
Come!

182
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,760
Bid farewell to your sisters.

183
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,519
<font color="yellow">Love well our father.
</font>Prescribe not us our duty.

184
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,039
Let your study be
to content your lord

185
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,520
who hath received you
at fortune's alms.

186
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,759
I think our father
will hence tonight.

187
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,519
That's most certain, and with you.
Next month with us.

188
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,759
You see how full of changes
his age is.

189
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,519
He always loved our sister most and
with what poor judgment he hath now
cast her off appears too grossly.

190
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,279
'Tis the infirmity of his age,

191
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,039
yet he hath ever
but slenderly known himself.

192
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,759
The best and soundest of his time
hath been but rash.

193
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,759
If our father carry authority
with such dispositions as this,

194
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,519
<font color="lime">it will but offend us.
</font>We shall further think on't.

195
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,039
We must do something and in the
heat. Pray, let us hit together.

196
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,519
Thou, Nature, art my goddess.

197
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,040
To thy law, my services are bound.

198
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,759
Why "bastard"? Wherefore "base"?

199
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,519
When my dimensions are as well
compact, my mind as generous

200
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,040
and my shape as true
as honest madam's issue?

201
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,519
Why brand they me with "base"?

202
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,279
With "baseness"?

203
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,720
"Bastardy"?

204
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,039
Legitimate Edgar,

205
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,480
I must have your land.

206
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,280
Well, my legiti-mate.

207
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,279
Edmund the base...

208
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,040
shall top the legitimate.

209
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,320
Excuse me.

210
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,760
Edmund, how now! What news?

211
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,879
<font color="cyan">I know no news, my lord.
</font><font color="yellow">What paper were you reading?</font>

212
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,719
<font color="cyan">Nothing, my lord.</font> No?

213
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,279
What needed, then, that terrible
dispatch of it into your pocket?

214
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,039
The quality of nothing hath not
such need to hide itself.

215
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,720
Let's see. Come, if it be nothing,
I shall not need spectacles.

216
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,039
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.

217
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,039
It is a letter from my brother
that I have not all o'er-read

218
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,039
and for so much as I have perused,

219
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,240
I find it not fit
for your o'er-looking.

220
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,320
Give me the letter, sir.

221
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,519
"If our father...

222
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,959
"would sleep till I waked him,

223
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,519
"you should enjoy half his revenue
for ever

224
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,199
"and live the beloved
of your brother, Edgar."

225
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,040
Sleep till I waked him?

226
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,279
Enjoy half his revenue? My son
Edgar? When came this to you?

227
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,759
<font color="yellow">Who brought it?
</font><font color="cyan">I found it in my room.</font>

228
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,239
You know the character
to be your brother's?

229
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,279
If the matter were good, my lord,
I durst swear it were his,

230
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,239
but, in respect of that,
I would fain think it were not.

231
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,759
<font color="yellow">It is his.</font> It is his hand, my lord,

232
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,039
but I hope his heart
is not in the contents.

233
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,759
<font color="yellow">Hath he never before sounded you
in this business?</font> Never, my lord,

234
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,039
but I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit

235
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,759
that sons at perfect age
and fathers declined,

236
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,519
the father should be as ward to the
son and the son manage his revenue.

237
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,840
O, villain!

238
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,679
Villain!
His very opinion in the letter.

239
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,720
<font color="yellow">Go seek him. Where is he?
</font><font color="cyan">I do not well know, my lord.</font>

240
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,240
These late eclipses of the sun
and moon portend no good to us.

241
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
We have seen the best of our time.

242
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,280
Find out this villain, Edmund.

243
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,040
It shall lose thee nothing.

244
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,560
Do it carefully.

245
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,519
This is the excellent foppery of
the world, that when we are sick

246
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,519
in fortune, often the surfeit
of our own behaviour,

247
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,399
we make guilty of our disasters
the sun, the moon and stars,

248
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,039
as if we were villains
of necessity -

249
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,239
fools by heavenly compulsion.

250
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,519
Knaves, thieves, and treachers
by spherical predominance.

251
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,519
Drunkards, liars and adulterers

252
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,279
by an enforced obedience
of planetary influence.

253
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,719
And all that we are evil in
by a divine thrusting on.

254
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,520
How now, brother Edmund?

255
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,240
Ah, these eclipses do portend
these divisions.

256
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,200
What serious contemplation
are you in?

257
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,039
I am thinking, brother, of a
prediction I read this other day.

258
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,760
<font color="cyan">What should follow these eclipses.
</font>Do you busy yourself with that?

259
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,039
I promise you, the effects
he writes of succeed unhappily.

260
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
When saw you my father last?

261
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,759
Erm, the night gone by.

262
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,039
<font color="cyan">Spake you with him?</font> Ay.

263
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Two hours together.

264
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,640
Found you no displeasure in him
by word nor countenance?

265
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,920
None at all.

266
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,759
Bethink yourself wherein
you may have offended him

267
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,759
and at my entreaty forbear his
presence until some little time

268
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,279
hath qualified the heat
of his displeasure,

269
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,559
which at this instant so rageth in
him that with the mischief of your
person it would scarcely allay.

270
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,039
Some villain hath done me wrong.
That's my fear.

271
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,279
I pray you,
retire with me to my lodging,

272
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,279
from whence I will fitly
bring you to hear my lord speak.

273
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,040
Pray ye, go!

274
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,359
There's my key.
If you do stir abroad, go armed.

275
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,759
Armed? Brother...!
Brother, I advise you to the best.

276
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,759
I have told you what I have seen
and heard, but faintly.

277
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,200
Nothing like the image and
horror of it. Pray you, away.

278
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,039
A credulous father
and a brother noble,

279
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,759
whose nature is so far from doing
harmst hat he suspects none.

280
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,040
I grow, I prosper.
Now, gods, stand up for bastards.

281
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,360
Shall I hear from you anon?
I do serve you in this business.

282
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,279
Now, banish'd Kent,

283
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,999
if thou canst serve
where thou dost stand condemn'd,

284
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
so may it come, thy master,

285
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,279
whom thou lovest,

286
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,560
shall find thee full of labours.

287
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,800
Let me not stay a jot for dinner.

288
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,759
How now! What art thou?

289
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,759
A man, sir.

290
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,039
Oh.

291
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,039
What dost thou profess?

292
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,640
I do profess to be
no less than I seem.

293
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,040
<font color="cyan">What wouldst thou?</font> Service.

294
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,279
<font color="cyan">Who wouldst thou serve?</font> You.

295
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,519
Dost thou know me, fellow?

296
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,039
No, sir,

297
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,039
but you have...

298
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,840
that in your countenance
which I would fain call master.

299
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,040
<font color="cyan">What's that?</font> Authority.

300
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,519
Well, follow me.
Thou shalt serve me.

301
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,039
If I like thee no worse
after dinner,

302
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,999
I will not part from thee yet.

303
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,639
<font color="cyan">Dinner, ho!</font> <font color="yellow">Dinner, ho!</font>

304
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,279
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

305
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,079
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

306
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,039
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

307
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,039
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

308
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,039
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

309
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,719
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

310
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,039
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

311
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,239
Dinner, ho! Dinner, ho!

312
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,759
Dinner, ho!

313
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,279
Dinner!

314
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,599
Where's my knave? My fool? Eh?

315
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,760
Go in and call my fool hither.

316
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,199
You, sir. You. You!

317
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,439
<font color="cyan">Sirrah, where's my daughter?
</font><font color="yellow">So please you.</font>

318
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,519
What says the fellow there?
Call the clotpoll back.

319
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Where's my fool?
I think the world's asleep.

320
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,039
By day and night he wrongs me.
Every hour he flashes into

321
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,759
one gross crime or other that sets
us all at odds. I'll not endure it.

322
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,519
His knights grow riotous and himself
upbraids us on every trifle.

323
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,279
Say I am sick.

324
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,239
Put on what weary negligence
you please.

325
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,279
If he distaste it,
let him to my sister,

326
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,040
whose mind and mine I know in that
are one, not to be overruled.

327
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,520
Well, madam.

328
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,039
<font color="cyan">How now. Where's that mongrel?
</font>He says, my lord,
your daughter's not well.

329
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,759
Why came not the slave back to me
when I called him?

330
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,279
Sir, he answered me in the roundest
manner, he would not. He would not?!

331
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
Ooh!

332
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,759
Go and tell my daughter
I would speak with her.

333
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,040
<font color="cyan">Go you, call hither my fool.</font> Sir.

334
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,519
O, you, sir, you.
Come you hither, sir.

335
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,280
Who am I, sir?

336
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,519
<font color="yellow">My lady's father.
</font><font color="cyan">"My lady's father."</font>

337
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,839
My lord's knave, your whoreson dog,
you slave, you cur!

338
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,519
I am none of these, my lord.
I beseech your pardon.

339
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,519
<font color="cyan">Bandy looks with me, you rascal!
</font><font color="yellow">I'll not be struck, my lord.</font>

340
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,199
Nor tripped neither,
you base football player!

341
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,319
I thank thee, fellow.
Thou servest me and I'll love thee!

342
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,040
Come, sir, arise! Away!

343
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,479
Away! Away!

344
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,039
Let me hire him, too.
Here's my coxcomb.

345
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,759
How now, my pretty knave!
How dost thou?

346
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,319
Sirrah, you were best take
my coxcomb. <font color="lime">Why, fool?</font> Why?!

347
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,679
This fellow has banished
two of his daughters

348
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,679
and did the third a blessing
against his will.

349
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,400
If thou follow him,
thou must needs wear my coxcomb.

350
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,039
How now, nuncle.

351
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,039
Would I had two coxcombs
and two daughters.

352
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,519
Why, boy?

353
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,159
If I gave them all my living,
I'd keep my coxcombs myself.

354
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,119
There's mine.
Beg another of thy daughters.

355
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,040
Don't call me fool, boy!

356
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,039
All thy other titles
thou hast given away.

357
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,439
That thou wast born with.

358
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,040
This is not altogether fool,
my lord.

359
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,519
# Fools had ne'er less wit in a
year

360
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,039
# For wise men are grown foppish

361
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,159
# They know not how their wits
to wear

362
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,040
# Their manners are so apish... #

363
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,159
When were you wont to be
so full of songs, sirrah?

364
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,599
I have used it, nuncle, ever since
thou madest thy daughters
thy mothers.

365
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,519
Sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

366
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,919
I marvel what kin
thou and thy daughters are.

367
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,519
They'll have me whipped
for speaking true,

368
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,040
thou'lt have me whipped for lying.

369
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,039
And sometimes I am whipped
for holding my peace.

370
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
I had rather be any kind o' thing
than a fool...

371
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,040
..and yet I would not be thee,
nuncle.

372
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,039
Thou hast pared thy wit
on both sides

373
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,519
and left nothing in the middle.

374
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,720
Here comes one of the parings.

375
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,519
How now, daughter.

376
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,759
What makes that frontlet on?

377
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,519
Methinks you are too much
of late in the frown.

378
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,519
Not only, sir, this,
your all-licensed fool,

379
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,759
but other of your insolent retinue
do hourly carp and quarrel,

380
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,279
breaking forth in rank
and not-to-be endured riots.

381
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,719
Sir, I had thought, by making
this well known unto you,

382
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,039
to have found a safe redress,
but now grow fearful

383
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,759
by what yourself too late
have spoke and done.

384
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,760
That you protect this course
and put it on by your allowance.

385
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,759
Are you our daughter?

386
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,039
I would you would make use
of your good wisdom,

387
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,519
whereof I know you are fraught,
and put away these dispositions

388
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,839
which of late transport you
from what you rightly are.

389
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,079
May not an ass know
when the cart draws the horse?

390
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,679
Whoop, Jug! I love thee.

391
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,759
Does any here know me?!

392
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,519
This is not Lear?

393
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,039
Doth Lear walk thus? Speak thus?

394
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,039
Where are his eyes?

395
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,759
Either his notion weakens,
his discernings are lethargied...

396
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,519
Ha! Waking?

397
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,519
'Tis not so.

398
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,840
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

399
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,640
Lear's shadow.

400
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,759
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

401
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,520
This admiration, sir, is much of
the savour of other your new pranks.

402
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,759
I do beseech you to understand
my purposes aright,

403
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,839
as you are old and reverend,
should be wise.

404
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,759
Here do you keep a hundred
knights and squires.

405
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,039
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd
and bold, that this, our court,

406
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,759
infected with their manners,
shows like a riotous inn.

407
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,039
Be then desired by her, that else
will take the thing she begs,

408
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,959
a little to disquantity your train.

409
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,039
Darkness and devils!

410
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,039
Call my train together.

411
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,199
Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble
thee! Yet have I left a daughter.

412
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,759
You strike my people
and your disorder'd rabble

413
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,960
make servants of their betters.
Woe, that too late repents!

414
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,199
O, you, sir, are you come?
Is it your will? Speak, sir.

415
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,039
Pray, sir, be patient.

416
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,039
O, most small fault.

417
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,759
How ugly didst thou
in Cordelia show!

418
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,519
Just like an engine,
wrench'd my frame of nature

419
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,080
from the fix'd place
drew from heart all love...

420
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,480
..and added to the gall.

421
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,039
O Lear, Lear, Lear,
beat at this gate

422
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,759
that let thy folly in
and thy dear judgment out!

423
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Go! Go, my people!

424
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,279
My lord, I am guiltless, as I am
ignorant of what hath moved you.

425
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,520
It may be so, my lord.

426
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,519
Hear, nature, hear.
Dear goddess, hear!

427
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,279
Suspend thy purpose

428
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,519
if thou didst intend to make
this creature fruitful!

429
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,840
Into her womb convey sterility!

430
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,519
Dry up in her the organs
of increase

431
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,479
and from her derogate body never
spring a babe to honour her!

432
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,039
If she must teem,
create her child of spleen,

433
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,999
that it may live and be a thwart
disnatured torment to her!

434
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,039
Let it stamp wrinkles
in her brow of youth,

435
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,679
that she may feel how sharper
than a serpent's tooth it is

436
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,040
to have a thankless child!

437
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,400
Away! Away!

438
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,519
Now, gods that we adore,
whereof comes this?

439
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,039
Never afflict yourself
to know more of it.

440
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,039
But let his...disposition...

441
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,479
have that scope
that dotage gives it.

442
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,520
O, you, you, sirrah!

443
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,039
What, 50 of my followers at a clap
within a fortnight!?

444
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,039
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, sir?
</font>I'll tell thee, life and death!

445
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,119
I am ashamed that thou hast power
to shake my manhood thus.

446
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,759
Blasts and fogs upon thee!

447
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,079
The untented woundings of a father's
curse pierce every sense about thee!

448
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,839
Let it be so,
yet have I left a daughter

449
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,040
who I'm sure is kind
and comfortable.

450
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,039
When she shall hear this of thee,

451
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,040
with her nails she'll flay
thy wolvish visage.

452
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,039
Thou shalt find
that I'll resume the shape

453
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,040
which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever.

454
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Thou shalt, I warrant thee.

455
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,680
Away! Away!

456
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
Do you mark that?

457
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,799
I can't be so partial, Goneril,
to the great love I bear you.

458
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,519
Pray you, content.

459
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,039
Oswald!

460
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,519
You, sir, more knave than fool,
after your master.

461
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,280
Nuncle Lear! Nuncle Lear! Tarry...

462
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,759
A hundred knights!

463
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,519
Take the fool with thee!

464
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,039
'Tis politic and safe to let him
keep at point a hundred knights.

465
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,519
Yes, that, on every dream,

466
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,039
each buzz, each fancy,
each complaint, dislike,

467
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,999
he may enguard his dotage with their
powers and hold our lives in mercy!

468
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,759
Oswald, I say!

469
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,039
Well, you may fear too far.

470
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,879
Safer than trust too far.

471
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,040
I know his heart.

472
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,039
What he hath utter'd,
I have writ my sister

473
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,119
if she sustain him
and his hundred knights

474
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
when I have show'd the unfitness.

475
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,759
Oswald, away to my sister. Inform
her full of my particular fear,

476
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,759
and thereto add such reasons
of your own as may compact it more.

477
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,280
Get you gone and hasten your return.

478
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:07,039
If a man's brains were in's heels,
were't not in danger of kibes?

479
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,759
Ay, boy.

480
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,039
Then, I prithee, be merry.

481
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,039
Thy wit shall not go slip-shod.
Oy, oy.

482
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,520
Ha!

483
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,759
Thou canst tell why one's nose
stands in the middle on's face?

484
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,039
No.

485
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,039
Why, to keep one's eyes
of either side's nose.

486
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,040
That what a man cannot smell out,
he may spy into.

487
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,520
Oy, oy.

488
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,440
I did her wrong.

489
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,759
Canst tell how an oyster
makes his shell?

490
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,279
No.

491
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,040
Nor I neither.

492
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,519
But I can tell why a snail
has a house.

493
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,760
<font color="cyan">Why?</font> Why, to put its head in.

494
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,040
Not to give it away to his daughters
and leave his horns without a case.

495
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,760
I will forget my nature.

496
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,520
I'm so kind a father.

497
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,519
The reason why the seven stars
are no more than seven

498
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,279
is a pretty reason.

499
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,159
Because they are not eight?

500
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,040
Yes, indeed.

501
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,039
Thou wouldst make a good fool.

502
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Monster ingratitude.

503
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,519
If thou wert my fool, nuncle,

504
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,760
I'd have thee beaten
for being old before thy time.

505
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,280
How's that?

506
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,040
Thou shouldst not have been old
till thou hadst been wise.

507
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
O, let me not be mad.

508
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Not mad, sweet heavens.

509
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,040
Keep me in temper.

510
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,519
I would not be mad.

511
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,720
Ready, my lord.

512
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,280
Come, boy.

513
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,519
Brother, a word.

514
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
Descend, brother, I say!

515
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,479
O, sir, fly this place. Intelligence
is given where you are hid.

516
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,519
The Duke of Cornwall
is coming hither now in haste
and Regan with him.

517
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,519
<font color="cyan">Have you nothing said upon
his party?</font> I am sure of it!

518
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,280
<font color="cyan">Shh!</font> Not a word.

519
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,520
I hear my father coming.

520
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,280
Help! Help!

521
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,760
<font color="cyan">Fly, my brother. Fly.
</font>

522
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,520
Help!

523
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
Help!

524
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,040
I have seen drunkards
do more than this in sport.

525
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,480
Aargh.

526
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,040
Help!

527
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,519
Help!

528
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,279
Take your positions!

529
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,759
<font color="yellow">Where is the villain?
</font><font color="cyan">Here stood he in the dark,</font>

530
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,519
mumbling of wicked charms,

531
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,039
conjuring the moon
to stand auspicious mistress.

532
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,279
But where is he? <font color="cyan">Look, sir, I bleed.
</font>Where is the villain, Edmund?

533
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,519
<font color="cyan">Fled this way, sir, when by no
means he could...</font> Pursue him, ho!

534
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,039
Go after!

535
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,279
<font color="yellow">By no means what?</font> Persuade me to
the murder of Your Lordship.

536
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,759
Not in this land
shall he remain uncaught.

537
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,479
And found, dispatched.

538
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,039
It is the duke.

539
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,919
All ports I'll bar,
the duke must grant me that.

540
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,039
The villain shalt not 'scape.

541
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,039
And of my land,
loyal and natural boy,

542
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,000
I'll work the means
to make thee capable.

543
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,039
How dost, my lord?

544
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,759
O, madam, my old heart is crack'd.
It's crack'd!

545
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,279
What, did my father's godson
seek your life?

546
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,519
O, lady, lady,
shame would have it hid.

547
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,039
Was he not companion with
the riotous knights
that tended upon my father?

548
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,279
I know not, madam.
'Tis too bad, too bad.

549
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,039
<font color="cyan">Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
</font>No marvel, then,
though he were ill affected.

550
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,039
I have this present evening from my
sister been well inform'd of them

551
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,519
and with such cautions that if
they come to sojourn at my house,

552
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,040
I'll not be there.
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.

553
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,039
Edmund, I hear you've shown
your father a child-like office.

554
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,759
'Twas my duty, sir.

555
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,799
Received this hurt you see
striving to apprehend him.

556
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,759
<font color="lime">Is he pursued?</font> Ay, my good lord.

557
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,039
If he be taken, he shall never
more be fear'd of doing harm.

558
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,759
For you, Edmund, natures of such
deep trust we shall much need.

559
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,279
<font color="lime">You we first seize on.</font> I shall serve
you, sir, truly, however else.

560
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,759
<font color="yellow">For him I thank your grace.</font> You
know not why we came to visit you?

561
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,519
Thus out of season,
threading dark-eyed night.

562
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,039
Occasions, noble Gloucester,
of some poise,

563
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,519
wherein we must have use
of your advice.

564
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,280
Find him!

565
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,760
Arrgh!

566
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,479
<font color="yellow">Art of this house, friend?</font> Ay.

567
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,040
<font color="yellow">Where may we stop?</font> I' the mire.

568
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,519
I prithee, if thou lovest me,
tell me. <font color="lime">I love thee not.</font>

569
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,519
Why, then, I care not for thee.

570
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,279
If I had thee in a ring,
I'd make thee care for me.

571
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,279
Why dost thou use me thus? I know
thee not. <font color="lime">Fellow, I know thee.</font>

572
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,279
What dost thou know me for?

573
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,759
A knave, a rascal,

574
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,039
a base, proud, shallow, beggarly,

575
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,039
three-suited, hundred-pound,

576
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,519
filthy, worsted-stocking knave.

577
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,519
Why, what a monstrous fellow
art thou, thus to rail on one

578
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,039
that neither knowns thee
nor is known of thee!

579
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,279
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou
to deny thou knowest me!

580
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,039
I tripped up thy heels
and beat thee before the king?

581
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,759
I'll make a sop of the moonlight
of you, you whoreson!

582
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,039
Away!
I have nothing to do with thee.

583
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,519
You rascal!
You take the puppet's part

584
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,399
against the royalty
of her father, you rogue?!

585
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,559
Help! Murder! Help!

586
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,439
Stand, you rogue!

587
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,879
Help!

588
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,840
<font color="yellow">Help!</font> How now! What's the matter?

589
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,039
With you, goodman boy!

590
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,519
If you please, come, I'll beat ye!
Come on, young master!

591
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,279
<font color="yellow">What's the matter here?
</font><font color="cyan">Keep peace upon your lives.</font>

592
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,279
He dies that strikes again.

593
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,479
<font color="cyan">What is the matter?</font> The messengers
from our sister and the king.

594
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,519
What is your difference? Speak.

595
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,639
Sir, this ancient ruffian,
whose life I have spared...

596
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,239
You whoreson zed!
You unnecessary letter!

597
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,759
Peace, sirrah!
Know you no reverence?

598
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,039
<font color="lime">Yes, sir, but anger hath
a privilege.</font> Why art thou angry?

599
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,759
That such a slave as this
should walk the world,

600
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,279
<font color="lime">who wears no honesty.
</font><font color="cyan">What is his fault?</font>

601
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,519
His countenance likes me not.

602
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,040
No more, perchance, does mine,
nor his, nor hers.

603
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,039
I have seen better faces in my time

604
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,240
than stands on any shoulder that
I see before me at this instant.

605
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,040
You stubborn, ancient knave.

606
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,839
We'll teach you.

607
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,039
I serve the King!

608
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,279
Thy have life and honour.

609
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,639
Here shall he stay till...noon.

610
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,039
Till noon?! Till night, my lord.

611
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,839
Why, madam, if I was your father's
dog, you should not use me so.

612
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,039
Sir, being his knave, I will.

613
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,039
This is a fellow of the self-same
colour our sister speaks of.

614
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,519
The King, his master, must take it
ill, that he's so slightly valued

615
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,280
in his messenger,
should have him thus restrain'd.

616
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,039
I'll answer that.

617
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,519
My sister may receive it
much more worse,

618
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,519
to have her gentleman abused,
assaulted.

619
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,039
Come, away.

620
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,720
Dismissed!

621
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,439
I am sorry for thee, friend.
I'll entreat for thee.

622
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,279
Pray, do not, sir.

623
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,280
The duke's to blame in this.
'Twill be ill taken.

624
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,760
Arrgh!

625
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,759
I heard myself...

626
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
proclaim'd.

627
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,039
Edgar!

628
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,760
Edgar.

629
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,519
I...

630
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,280
nothing...

631
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,520
..am.

632
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,519
Ha, ha!

633
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,760
He wears cruel garters.

634
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Hail to thee, noble master.

635
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,039
What's he that hath so much thy
place mistook to set thee here?

636
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,199
It is both he and she -
your son and daughter.

637
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,759
<font color="cyan">No.</font> Yes.

638
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,759
<font color="cyan">No, I say.</font> I say, yea.

639
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,520
<font color="cyan">By Jupiter, I swear, no.
</font><font color="lime">By Juno, I swear, ay.</font>

640
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,519
Where is this daughter?

641
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,760
Give me my servant forth!

642
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,959
Deny to speak with me?

643
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,759
They are sick? They are weary?

644
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,039
They have travell'd all the night?

645
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,279
Ha!

646
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,760
Mere fetches...

647
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,279
..the images of revolt
and flying off.

648
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,440
Fetch me a better answer.

649
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,039
Go tell the duke and his wife
I'd speak with them now, presently.

650
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,039
Bid them come forth and hear me.

651
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,040
At their chamber-door, I'll beat
the drum till it cry sleep to death.

652
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,279
I would have all well betwixt you.

653
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,759
O me, my heart, my rising heart,
but, down.

654
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,519
Cry to it, nuncle,
as the cockney did to the eels

655
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,759
when she put 'em in the paste alive.

656
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,279
She knapped 'em on the coxcombs
with a stick,

657
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,520
and cried "Down, wantons, down!"

658
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,599
Good morrow to you both.

659
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,519
Hail to your grace.

660
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,759
I am glad to see Your Highness.

661
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,039
Regan, I think you are.

662
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,039
I have good reason to think so.

663
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,520
O, are you free?

664
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,039
Thy sister's naught. O, Regan, she
hath tied sharp-tooth'd unkindness,

665
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,759
like a vulture, here,
I can scarce speak to thee.

666
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,759
Thou'lt not believe with
how depraved a quality...

667
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,879
<font color="cyan">O, Regan.
</font>I pray you, sir, take patience.

668
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,039
I have hope.

669
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,079
You less know how to value her
desert than she to scant her duty.

670
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,759
Say, how is that?

671
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,039
I cannot think my sister in the
least should fail her obligation,

672
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,519
if, sir, perchance she hath
restrain'd the riots

673
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,519
of your followers,
'tis on such ground

674
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,759
and to such wholesome end
as clears her from all blame.

675
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,520
My curses on her!

676
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,759
O, sir, you are old.

677
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,279
Nature in you stands...

678
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,240
on the very verge of her confine.

679
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,039
You should be ruled and led
by some discretion

680
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,759
that discerns your state
better than you yourself.

681
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,279
Therefore, I pray you, that to
our sister you do make return,

682
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,359
say you have wrong'd her.

683
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,039
Ask her forgiveness?

684
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,759
Do you but mark how this
becomes the house?

685
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,039
"Dear daughter, I confess that
I am old, age is unnecessary.

686
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,759
"On my knees I beg that you'll
vouchsafe me raiment, bed and food."

687
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,759
Sir, these are unsightly tricks.
Return you to my sister.

688
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,399
Never, Regan!

689
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,039
She hath abated me of half my train,
look'd black upon me,

690
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,479
struck me with her tongue, most
serpent-like, upon the very heart.

691
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,279
All the stored vengeances of heaven
fall on her ingrateful top!

692
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,519
<font color="lime">Fie, sir, fie!
</font><font color="cyan">Strike her young bones!</font>

693
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
You taking airs, with lameness!

694
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,279
You nimble lightnings,

695
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,279
dart your blinding flames
into her scornful eyes!

696
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,759
Infect her beauty,
you fen-suck'd fogs,

697
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,039
drawn by the powerful sun
to fall and blast her.

698
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,839
O, the blest gods! So will you wish
on me when the rash mood is on?

699
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,520
No, Regan,
thou shalt never have my curse.

700
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,279
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not
give thee o'er to harshness.

701
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,880
Her eyes are fierce
but thine do comfort and not burn.

702
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,279
Thou better know'st the offices
of nature, bond of childhood,

703
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,919
effects of courtesy,
dues of gratitude.

704
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,759
Thy half of the kingdom
hast thou not forgot,

705
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,520
wherein I thee endow'd.

706
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,640
Good sir, to the purpose.

707
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,279
Who put my man in the stocks?

708
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,359
Is your lady come? This is a slave
whose easy-borrow'd pride

709
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,839
dwells in the fickle graced
of her he follows!

710
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,519
<font color="cyan">Out, varlet, from my sight!
</font><font color="lime">What means Your Grace?</font>

711
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,279
Who stock'd my servant?

712
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,039
Regan, I have good hope
thou didst not know on't.

713
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,800
Who comes here?

714
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,520
O heavens!

715
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,519
If you do love old men,
if your sweet sway allow obedience,

716
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,279
if you yourselves are old,
make it your cause,

717
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,360
send down and take my part.

718
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,880
Art not ashamed to look
upon this beard?

719
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,999
O, Regan,
will you take her by the hand?

720
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,519
Why not by the hand, sir?
How have I offended?

721
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,279
All's not offence that indiscretion
finds and dotage terms so.

722
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,760
Sides, you are too tough.
Will you yet hold?

723
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,039
<font color="cyan">How came my man in the stocks?!
</font><font color="lime">I set him there, sir.</font>

724
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,960
You? did you?

725
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,560
I pray you, Father,
being weak, seem so.

726
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,759
If, till the expiration of
your month, you will return

727
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,039
and sojourn with my sister,
dismissing half your train,

728
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,519
come then to me.

729
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,519
I am now from home
and out of that provision

730
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,199
which shall be needful
for your entertainment.

731
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,759
Return to her
and fifty men dismiss'd?

732
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,159
No!

733
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,519
Persuade me rather to be slave
and sumpter to this detested groom.

734
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,759
At your choice, sir.

735
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,279
I prithee, daughter,
do not make me mad.

736
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,759
I will not trouble thee, my child,
farewell.

737
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,400
We'll no more meet,
no more see one another.

738
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,760
But yet thou art my flesh,
my blood, my daughter.

739
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,519
Or rather a disease
that's in my flesh,

740
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,720
which I must needs call mine!

741
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,839
Thou art a boil, a plague-sore,

742
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,240
an embossed carbuncle
in my corrupted blood.

743
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,280
But I'll not chide thee.

744
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,039
Let shame come when it will.
I do not call it,

745
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,279
I do not bid the thunder-bearer
shoot,

746
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,759
nor tell tales of thee
to high-judging Jove.

747
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
Mend when thou canst...

748
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,799
..be better at thy leisure.

749
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,039
I can be patient.

750
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,039
I can stay with Regan.

751
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,039
I and my...

752
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
hundred knights.

753
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,720
Not altogether so.

754
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,039
I look'd not for you yet,

755
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,760
nor am provided
for your fit welcome.

756
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,040
Give ear, sir, to my sister...

757
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,519
..for those that mingle reason
with your passion

758
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,279
must be content to think you old,
and so...

759
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,880
But she knows what she does.

760
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,720
<font color="cyan">Is this well spoken?
</font>I dare avouch it, sir.

761
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,039
What, fifty followers?

762
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,039
Is it not well?
What should you need of more?

763
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,759
Yea, or so many,

764
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,039
sith that both charge and danger
speak 'gainst so great a number?

765
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,599
How, in one house, may many people,
under two commands, hold amity?

766
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,519
'Tis hard - almost impossible.

767
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,039
Why might not you, my lord,
receive attendance

768
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,759
from those that she calls servants
or from mine?

769
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,759
Why not, my lord? I do entrench you
to bring but five and twenty.

770
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,640
To no more will I give place
or notice.

771
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,280
I gave you all.

772
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,759
And in good time you gave it.

773
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,679
Made you my guardians,
my depositaries.

774
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,759
What, must I come to you
with five and twenty, Regan?

775
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,040
<font color="cyan">Said you so?</font> And speak't again,
my lord, no more with me.

776
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,039
I'll go with thee. Thy fifty yet
doth double five and twenty,

777
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,279
and thou art twice her love.

778
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,279
Hear me, my lord.

779
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,039
What need you five and twenty,
ten, or five,

780
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,239
to follow in a house where twice
so many have a command to tend you?

781
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,759
What need one?

782
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,520
Reason, not the need.

783
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,039
Our basest beggars are in
the poorest thing superfluous.

784
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,519
Allow not nature more than
nature needs,

785
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,280
a man's life's as cheap as beast's!

786
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,040
Thou art a lady!

787
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,039
If only to go warm were gorgeous.

788
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,039
Why, nature needs not what thou
gorgeous wear'st,

789
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,840
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

790
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,759
But for true need.

791
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,759
You heavens, give me that patience.

792
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,039
Patience I need!

793
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,039
You see me here, you gods,
a poor old man,

794
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,039
as full of grief as age -
wretched in both!

795
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,039
If it be you that stir
these daughters' hearts

796
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,759
against their father, fool me
not so much to bear it tamely,

797
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,799
touch me with noble anger

798
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,999
and let not women's weapons,
water-drops,

799
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,880
stain my man's cheeks!

800
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,520
No, you unnatural hags!

801
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,039
I will have such revenges on you
both that all the world shall...

802
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,679
I will do such things...

803
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,519
What they are, yet I know not,

804
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,480
but they shall be...

805
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,480
..the terrors of the earth!

806
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,520
You think I'll weep?

807
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,280
No!

808
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,920
I'll not weep.

809
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,279
I have full cause of weeping,

810
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,759
but this heart shall break into
a hundred thousand flaws,

811
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,520
or ere I'll weep.

812
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,520
O, fool.

813
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,040
I shall go mad.

814
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,039
It will be a storm.

815
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,759
The old man and his people
cannot be well bestow'd.

816
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,439
'Tis his own blame
hath put himself from rest,

817
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,519
and must needs taste his folly.

818
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,759
For his particular, I'll receive
him gladly, but not one follower.

819
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,200
<font color="lime">So am I purposed.
Where is my lord of Gloucester?
</font><font color="cyan">Follow'd the old man forth.</font>

820
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,039
The King is in high rage.
<font color="cyan">Whither is he going?</font> I know not.

821
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,519
It is best to give him way.
He leads himself.

822
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,759
My lord, entreat him
by no means to stay.

823
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,039
Alack, the high winds
do sorely ruffle.

824
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,519
For many miles a bout
there's scarce a bush.

825
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,759
O, sir, to wilful men, the injuries
that they themselves procure

826
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,440
must be their schoolmasters.
Shut up your doors.
Shut up your doors, my lord.

827
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,519
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!
Rage! Blow!

828
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,759
You cataracts and hurricanoes,

829
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,759
spout till you have drench'd
our steeples, drown'd the cocks!

830
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,039
You sulphurous
and thought-executing fires,

831
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,039
vaunt-couriers
to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,

832
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,759
singe my white head!

833
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,279
And thou, all-shaking thunder,

834
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,639
strike flat the thick rotundity
of the world!

835
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,759
Crack nature's moulds,
all germens spill at once,

836
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,759
that makes ingrateful man!

837
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,359
Good nuncle, in,
ask thy daughters' blessing.

838
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,279
Rumble thy bellyful!

839
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,279
Spit fire! Spout rain!

840
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,639
I tax not you, you elements,
with unkindness.

841
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,279
Then let fall
your horrible pleasure.

842
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,039
Here I stand, your slave,

843
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,519
a poor, infirm, weak
and despised old man.

844
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,239
He that has a house to put's head in
has a good head-piece.

845
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,800
Alas, sir, are you here?

846
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,039
Let the great gods that keep this
dreadful pother o'er our heads

847
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,039
find out their enemies now.

848
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,519
I am a man more sinn'd against
than sinning.

849
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,279
Gracious, my lord.
Hard by here is a hovel.

850
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,280
Some friendship will it lend you
'gainst the tempest.

851
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,560
My wits begin to turn.

852
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,519
Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy?
Art cold? I am cold myself.

853
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,039
Come, your hovel.

854
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,759
Poor fool and knave,

855
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,040
I have one part in my heart
that's sorry yet for thee.

856
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,519
# He that has and a little tiny wit

857
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,759
# With hey, ho,
the wind and the rain

858
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,759
# Must make content
with his fortunes fit

859
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,119
# For the rain it raineth
every day. #

860
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,439
I like not this unnatural dealing.

861
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,279
They've taken from me
the use of mine own house,

862
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,039
charged me on pain of
perpetual displeasure

863
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,519
neither to speak of him, entreat
for him, nor any way sustain him.

864
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,040
<font color="cyan">Most savage and unnatural!
</font><font color="yellow">Go to. Say you nothing.</font>

865
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,279
I have received a letter this night.

866
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,280
'Tis dangerous to be spoken.

867
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,759
These injuries the king now bears
will be revenged.

868
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,040
There's part of a power from France
already footed.

869
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,280
We must incline to the King.

870
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,279
I will look for him. Go you
and maintain talk with the duke,

871
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,520
that my charity be not of him
perceived.

872
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,520
If he ask for me,
I am ill and gone to bed.

873
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,040
If I die for it,
as no less is threatened me...

874
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,280
..the King, my old master,
must be relieved.

875
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,040
Pray you, be careful.

876
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,040
Here is the place, my lord.

877
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,039
Good, my lord.

878
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,519
Enter.

879
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,280
The tyranny of the open night's
too rough for nature to endure.

880
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,079
<font color="cyan">Let me alone.
</font><font color="lime">Good, my lord. Enter here.</font>

881
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,879
Prithee, go in thyself.
Seek thine own ease.

882
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,519
This tempest will not give me
leave to ponder

883
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,239
on things would hurt me more,
but I'll go in. In, boy. Go first.

884
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,039
I'll pray...

885
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,160
and then I'll sleep.

886
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,520
Poor naked wretches...

887
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,759
..whereso'er you are,

888
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,760
that bide the pelting
of this pitiless storm...

889
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,760
..how shall your houseless heads,
your unfed sides...

890
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,519
..your loop'd
and window'd raggedness,

891
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,040
defend you from seasons
such as these?

892
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,520
O, I have ta'en
too little care of this.

893
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,719
Take physic, pomp!

894
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,559
Expose thyself to feel
what wretches feel!

895
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,519
Help! Help! Help me!

896
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,440
A spirit! A spirit!

897
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,760
What art thou that dost grumble
there? Come forth!

898
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,279
Away!

899
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,119
The foul fiend follows me!

900
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,879
Go to thy bed and warm thee!

901
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,879
Hast thou give all to thy daughters
and art thou come to this?

902
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,639
He hath no daughters, sir.

903
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,119
Poor Tom!

904
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,759
Death, traitor! Nothing could have
subdued nature to such a lowness

905
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,759
but his unkind daughters.

906
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,759
Bless thy five wits.

907
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,119
Tom's a-cold.

908
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,439
What hast thou been?

909
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,519
A serving-man,
proud in heart and mind,

910
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,519
who curled my hair,
wore gloves in my cap,

911
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,519
served the lust
of my mistress' heart

912
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,799
and did the act of darkness
with her!

913
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,279
In the sweet face of heaven!

914
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,159
Dolphin, my boy!

915
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,880
My boy, sessa!

916
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,159
Is man no more than this?

917
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,519
Ha, ha! Here's three on 's
are sophisticated!

918
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,279
Thou art the thing itself.

919
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,039
Unaccommodated man is no more
but such a poor bare, forked animal

920
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,759
as thou art.

921
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,519
Off, off, you lendings!

922
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,279
Come unbutton here.

923
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,519
Prithee, nuncle, be contented.

924
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,960
'Tis a naughty night to swim in.

925
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,879
Look, here comes a walking fire.

926
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,159
How fares Your Grace?

927
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,119
Poor Tom,
that eats the swimming frog.

928
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,759
Has Your Grace no better company?

929
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,039
The prince of darkness
is a gentle... A-cold!

930
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,759
Come with me.

931
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,039
I have ventured to come
seek you out

932
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,719
and bring you where both fire
and food is ready.

933
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,279
First let me talk a word
with this philosopher.

934
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,039
<font color="lime">Good, my lord.
</font><font color="cyan">What is the cause of thunder?</font>

935
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,039
Good, my lord, take his offer
and go to the house.

936
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,039
I do beseech Your Grace...

937
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,759
Cry your mercy, sir. Come, noble
philosopher, your company.

938
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,519
Tom's a-cold.

939
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,759
In, fellow, there. Keep thee warm.

940
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,279
No, no, this way, my lord.

941
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,039
With him, I will keep company
with my philosopher.

942
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,039
Come, good Athenian.

943
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,039
Soothe him good, my lord.
Let him take the fellow on.

944
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,759
Take him you on.

945
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,039
Come, good sir. Good Athenian.

946
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Fie, foh, fum,
I smell the blood of a British man!

947
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,519
This is the letter
which he spoke of,

948
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,040
which proves him an intelligent
party to the advantages of France.

949
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Come with me to my wife.

950
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,279
If the matter of this paper
be certain,

951
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,279
you have mighty business at hand.

952
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,199
True or false, it hath made thee
earl of Gloucester. Seek out

953
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,200
where thy father is, that he may be
ready for our apprehension.

954
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,039
Here is better than the open air.
Take it thankfully.

955
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,039
I will piece out the comfort
with what addition I can.

956
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,520
<font color="yellow">I will not be long from you.</font> The
gods reward you for your kindness.

957
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,759
Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a
madman be a gentleman or a yeoman?

958
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,279
A king!

959
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,759
King!

960
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,759
He's mad that trusts in
the tameness of a wolf,

961
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,039
a horse's health,

962
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,040
a boy's love or a whore's oath.

963
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,759
It shall be done.

964
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,040
I will arraign them straight!

965
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,279
Come, sit thou here,
most learned justicer.

966
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,039
Sit down there, sapient, sir.

967
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,280
Sit!

968
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,760
Now, you she foxes!

969
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,279
How do you, sir?

970
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,040
Stand you not so amazed.

971
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,280
Will you lie down
and rest upon the cushions?

972
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,280
I'll see their trial first.

973
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,040
Bring their evidence.

974
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,759
Thou robed man of justice,
take thy place.

975
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,519
Thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
bench by his side.

976
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,280
You are of the commission.
Sit you, too.

977
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,280
Let us deal justly.

978
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,760
Arraign her first, 'tis Goneril.

979
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,759
I here take my oath
before this honourable assembly,

980
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,280
she kicked the poor king -
her father.

981
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,759
Come hither, mistress.
Is your name Goneril?

982
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,519
She cannot deny it!

983
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,040
Cry you mercy?
I took you for a joint-stool.

984
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,039
And here's another
whose warp'd looks proclaim

985
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,519
what store her heart is made on.

986
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,279
Stop her there!

987
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,279
Arms, arms, sword, fire!
Corruption in the place!

988
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,039
False justicer,
why hast thou let her 'scape?!

989
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,760
O, pity, sir.

990
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,519
Where...

991
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,040
Where's the patience now that
you so oft have boasted to retain?

992
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,039
The little dogs and all.

993
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,039
Tray, Blanch and Sweet-heart.

994
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,039
They bark at me.

995
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,760
Tom will throw his head at them.
Avaunt, you curs!

996
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,759
Then let them anatomise Regan!

997
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,520
See what breeds about her heart.

998
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,760
Is there any cause in nature...

999
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,040
..that makes these hard hearts?

1000
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,279
You, sir,

1001
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,039
I entertain for one of my hundred
and I do not like your garments,

1002
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,760
you will say they are Persian
and let them be changed.

1003
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,280
Now...

1004
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,040
..good, my lord.

1005
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,280
Lie here and rest awhile.

1006
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,039
Make no noise, make no noise.

1007
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,039
Draw the curtains.

1008
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,519
So...

1009
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,520
So, go to supper in the morning.

1010
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,040
And I'll go to bed at noon.

1011
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,759
Come hither, friend.
Where is the King, my master?

1012
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,039
Here, sir, but trouble him not.
His wits are gone.

1013
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,279
Good friend, I prithee, take him in
thy arms. There is a litter ready.

1014
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,759
Lay him in it and drive
towards Dover, friend,

1015
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,279
where thou shalt meet both welcome
and protection. Take up thy master!

1016
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,279
If thou shouldst dally half an hour,
his life with thine

1017
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,279
and all who offer to defend him,
stand in assured loss.

1018
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,040
Take up and follow me!

1019
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,759
Who alone suffers
suffers most in the mind,

1020
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:49,040
leaving free thoughts
and happy shows behind.

1021
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,760
How light and portable
my pain seems now...

1022
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,040
..when that which made me bend
made the King bow.

1023
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,040
He childed...

1024
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,040
..as I father'd.

1025
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,040
To-o-o-om.

1026
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,040
Away.

1027
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,519
The army of France is landed.
Seek out the traitor Gloucester.

1028
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,999
Go seek the traitor Gloucester.

1029
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,279
Pinion him like a thief.

1030
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,280
Bring him before us.

1031
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,759
Hang him instantly.
Pluck out his eyes.

1032
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,760
Leave him to my displeasure.

1033
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,280
Edmund.

1034
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,040
Keep you our sister company.

1035
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,039
The revenges we are bound to take
upon your traitorous father

1036
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,080
are not fit for your beholding.

1037
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,760
<font color="cyan">Farewell, dear sister.
</font><font color="lime">Farewell, sweet lord.</font>

1038
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,280
And sister.

1039
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,759
Edmund.

1040
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,520
Farewell.

1041
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,800
Who's there?

1042
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,519
The traitor?

1043
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,640
Ingrateful fox. 'Tis he.

1044
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,319
<font color="cyan">Bind fast his corky arms.
</font><font color="yellow">What mean Your Graces?</font>

1045
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,679
Good, my friends, consider
you are my guests.

1046
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:26,319
<font color="yellow">Do me no foul play, friends.
</font><font color="cyan">Bind him, I say.</font>

1047
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,519
Hard.

1048
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,039
Hard!

1049
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,759
O, filthy traitor. Unmerciful lady
as you are, I'm none!

1050
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,759
To the chair bind him.

1051
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,519
<font color="cyan">Villain, thou shalt find...</font> Arrgh!

1052
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,519
By kind, gods.

1053
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,519
'Tis most ignobly done
to pluck me by the beard.

1054
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,799
So white and such a traitor.

1055
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,519
These hairs, which thou dost
ravish from my chin,

1056
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,519
will quicken and accuse thee.

1057
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,760
I'm your host!

1058
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,519
With robbers' hands, my hospitable
favours you should not ruffle thus.

1059
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,520
<font color="yellow">What will you do?</font> Come, sir.

1060
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,519
<font color="cyan">What letters had you late from
France?</font> Be simple answerer,
for we know the truth.

1061
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,280
<font color="cyan">And what confederacy have you with
the traitors...</font> To whose hands you
have sent the lunatic king? Speak.

1062
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,759
I have a letter guessingly set down,

1063
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,519
which comes from one
that's of a neutral heart

1064
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,039
<font color="yellow">and not from one opposed.
</font><font color="cyan">Cunning.</font> And false.

1065
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,040
Where hast thou sent the King?

1066
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,520
To Dover.

1067
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,279
Wherefore to Dover?

1068
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,759
Wast thou not charged at peril...
Wherefore to Dover?!

1069
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,759
Let him answer that.

1070
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,759
I am tied to the stake
and I must stand the course.

1071
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,359
Wherefore to Dover?!

1072
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:40,359
Because I would not see thy cruel
nails pluck out his poor old eyes,

1073
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,159
nor thy fierce sister in his
anointed flesh stick boarish fangs,

1074
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,079
but I shall see the winged vengeance
overtake such children!

1075
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,039
I'll see't shalt thou never.

1076
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,040
Fellows, hold the chair.

1077
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,519
Uh?

1078
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,880
Argh!

1079
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,760
He who will think to live till
he be old, give me some help!

1080
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,519
O, cruel!

1081
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,520
O, you gods!

1082
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,959
Arrgh!

1083
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,440
Aaaarrrgh!

1084
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,919
Argh! Argh!

1085
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,040
Aarrgh!

1086
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,039
One side will mock another.

1087
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,760
The other, too.

1088
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,440
If you see vengeance...

1089
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,040
Aarrgh!

1090
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,039
Hold your hand, my lord. I have
served you ever since I was a child

1091
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,159
but better service have I never
done you than now to bid you hold.

1092
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,759
How now, you dog?!

1093
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,040
If you did wear a beard upon your
chin, I'd shake it on this quarrel.

1094
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,040
Argh!

1095
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,759
A peasant stand up thus?!

1096
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,760
My lord...

1097
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,760
..you have one eye left
to see some mischief on him.

1098
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,039
Lest it see more...

1099
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,760
prevent it.

1100
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,519
Aaarrgh!

1101
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,280
Out, vile jelly.

1102
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,040
Where's my son Edmund?

1103
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,039
It was he who made the overture
of thy treasons to us,

1104
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,039
who is too good to pity thee.

1105
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,520
O, my follies!

1106
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,760
Then Edgar was abused.

1107
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,039
Kind gods, forgive me that...

1108
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,479
and prosper him.

1109
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,320
Go thrust him out at gates
and let him smell his way to Dover.

1110
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,040
How is't, my lord? How look you?

1111
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,040
I have received a hurt.

1112
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,039
O, Regan...

1113
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,040
I bleed apace.

1114
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,040
Untimely comes this hurt.

1115
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,520
Give me your arm.

1116
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,039
To be worst.

1117
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,039
The lowest and most dejected
thing of fortune.

1118
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,039
Stands still in hope.

1119
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,040
Lives not in fear.

1120
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,520
Who is it can say,
"I am at the worst"?

1121
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,279
"I am worse than e'er I was

1122
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,760
"and worse I may be yet."

1123
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,279
The worst is not
so long as we can say,

1124
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,240
"This is the worst."

1125
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,160
Away! Away, good friend. Be gone.

1126
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,039
Thy comfort will do me no good
at all.

1127
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,040
<font color="yellow">Thee they may hurt.</font> Now, now.

1128
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,279
Who's there?

1129
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,759
Is it...

1130
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,759
It is a poor mad man.

1131
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,679
Hello! Where goest?

1132
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,039
<font color="yellow">Is it a beggar man?</font> Mad man.

1133
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,039
And beggar, too.

1134
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,759
In the last night's storm
I such a fellow saw.

1135
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,040
Made me think of man a worm.

1136
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,039
My son came then into my mind

1137
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,759
and yet my mind was then
scarce friends with him.

1138
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,520
I've heard more since.

1139
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,519
As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

1140
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,800
They kill us for their sport.

1141
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,279
Bless thee, master!

1142
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,839
Is that the naked fellow?

1143
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,759
Ay, my lord.

1144
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,519
Get thee away, and bring some
covering for this naked soul,

1145
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,759
which I'll entreat to lead me.

1146
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,039
Alack, sir, he is mad.

1147
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,039
'Tis the times' plague,
when madmen lead the blind.

1148
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,759
Do as I bid thee
or rather do thy pleasure.

1149
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,519
Above the rest, be gone.

1150
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,519
I'll bring the best 'parel that
I have, come of it what will.

1151
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,280
Come hither, fellow.

1152
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,280
Dost thou know Dover?

1153
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,760
Ay, master.

1154
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,519
There is a cliff,
whose high and bending head

1155
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,039
looks fearfully
in the confined deep.

1156
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,279
Bring me but to the very brim of it.

1157
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,040
From that place
I shall no leading need.

1158
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,040
Stand still!

1159
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,119
How fearful and dizzy 'tis
to cast one's eyes so low.

1160
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,479
Oh, I'll look no more,

1161
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:30,680
lest my brain turn and the deficient
sight topple down headlong.

1162
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,520
Set me where you stand.

1163
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,280
Give me your hand.

1164
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,520
Whoa!

1165
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,279
You are now within a foot
of the extreme verge,

1166
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,400
for all beneath the moon
would I not look upright.

1167
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,760
Let go my hand.

1168
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,320
Go thou farther off.

1169
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,280
Bid me farewell
and let me hear thee going.

1170
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,040
Now, fare you well, good sir.

1171
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,040
With all my heart.

1172
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,520
O, you mighty gods...

1173
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,160
..this world I do renounce.

1174
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,520
If Edgar live...

1175
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,040
O...

1176
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,520
..bless him!

1177
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,040
Now, fellow...

1178
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,280
..fare thee well.

1179
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,760
Gone, sir. Farewell!

1180
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,040
Aaarrgh!

1181
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,959
Ho, you, sir! Friend!

1182
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,759
Hear you, sir!

1183
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,039
Speak!

1184
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,839
What are you, sir?

1185
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,039
Away, and let me die.

1186
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,919
But thou dost breathe.

1187
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,040
Thy life's a miracle.

1188
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,280
Speak yet again.

1189
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,039
<font color="yellow">But have I fallen or no?</font> From the
dread summit of this chalky bourn.

1190
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,759
Look up a-height!

1191
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,040
Look up! Alack, I have no eyes.

1192
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,759
Is wretchedness deprived
that benefit,

1193
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,040
to end itself by death?

1194
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,760
Give me your arm.

1195
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,040
Up.

1196
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,199
So, how is it?

1197
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,040
Feel you your legs?

1198
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,520
You stand.

1199
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,039
Too well...

1200
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,600
Too well.

1201
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,520
Bear free and patient thoughts.

1202
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,079
It is he.

1203
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,280
He was met even now,
as mad as the vex'd sea.

1204
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,279
A century send forth. Search every
acre in the high-grown field

1205
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,279
and bring my father to our eye.

1206
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,039
What can man's wisdom in the
restoring his bereaved sense?

1207
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,039
There is means. Our foster-nurse
of nature is with pause.

1208
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,759
Seek. Seek for him.

1209
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,279
Lest his ungovern'd rage
dissolve the life

1210
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,280
that wants the means to lead it.

1211
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,720
That fellow handles his bow
like a crow-keeper.

1212
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,240
Draw me a clothier's yard.

1213
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,039
Look, look, a mouse!

1214
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,759
Peace, peace.

1215
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,039
This piece of toasted cheese
will do it.

1216
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,719
I know that voice.

1217
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,519
O, well flown, bird.

1218
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,880
In the clout, in the clout. Hewgh!

1219
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,280
Ah.

1220
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,320
Give the word.

1221
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,839
Sweet marjoram. Pass.

1222
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,079
Goneril with a white beard.

1223
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,039
They flattered me like a dog
and told me I had white hairs

1224
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,279
in my beard
ere the black ones were there.

1225
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,279
To say "ay" and "no" to everything.

1226
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,759
I said "ay" and "no", too,
was no good divinity.

1227
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,159
That voice I do well remember.
Is't not the King?

1228
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,799
Ay, every inch a king.

1229
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,719
When I do stare,
see how the subject quakes.

1230
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,759
I pardon that man's life.
What was thy cause? Adultery?

1231
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,759
Thou shalt not die.

1232
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,919
Die for adultery? No!

1233
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,759
Let copulation thrive,
for Gloucester's bastard son

1234
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,519
was kinder to his father

1235
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,519
than my daughters got
'tween the lawful sheets.

1236
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,039
To it, luxury, pell-mell,
for I lack soldiers.

1237
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,039
Down from the waist they are
Centaurs, though women all above.

1238
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,039
But to the girdle do the gods
inherit, beneath is all the fiends,

1239
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,999
there's hell, there's darkness,
there's the sulphurous pit,

1240
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,720
burning, scalding, stench,
consumption - fie, fie, pah, pah!

1241
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,039
Give me an ounce of civet,
good apothecary,

1242
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,759
to sweeten my imagination.

1243
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,919
<font color="cyan">There's money for thee.
</font><font color="yellow">Let me kiss that hand!</font>

1244
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,039
Let me wipe it first.
It smells of mortality.

1245
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,920
Dost thou know me?

1246
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,240
I remember thine eyes well enough.

1247
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,639
Read thou this challenge.

1248
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,600
Mark but the penning of it.

1249
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,319
Were all thy letters suns,
I could not see one.

1250
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,240
<font color="cyan">Read.</font> What?

1251
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,039
With the case of eyes?!

1252
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,160
O, are you there with me?

1253
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,519
No eyes in your head,
nor no money in your purse?

1254
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:07,839
Your eyes are in a heavy case,
yet you may see how this world goes.

1255
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,519
<font color="yellow">I see it feelingly.</font> What?

1256
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,279
Art mad?

1257
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,279
A man may see how this world goes
with no eyes.

1258
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,039
Get thee glass eyes
and like a scurvy politician,

1259
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,039
seem to see the things
thou dost not.

1260
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,640
Now, now, now.

1261
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,520
If thou wilt weep my cause...

1262
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,280
..take my eyes.

1263
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,039
I know thee well enough.

1264
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,720
Thy name is Gloucester.

1265
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,519
Thou must be patient.

1266
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,760
We came crying hither.

1267
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,519
Thou know'st the first time
that we smell the air...

1268
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,520
we wail and cry.

1269
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,520
I will preach to thee, mark.

1270
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,760
When we are born, we cry...

1271
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,280
..that we are come
to this great stage of fools.

1272
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,039
This a good block.

1273
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,760
Oy, oy.

1274
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,759
It were a delicate stratagem
to shoe a troop of horse with felt.

1275
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,239
Shh.

1276
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:30,559
I'll put it in proof and when I
have stolen upon these sons-in-law,

1277
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,399
then kill, kill, kill...

1278
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,279
Hey, there he is! Lay hand upon him!

1279
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,040
..kill, kill, kill...

1280
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,039
I am a king, masters,
know you that?

1281
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,519
You are a royal one and we obey you.

1282
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,519
Then there is life in it.

1283
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,519
Come on, you get it,
you shall get it by running!

1284
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,919
Where's your master?

1285
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,959
Madam, aloft,
but never man so changed.

1286
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,919
I told him the French were landed,
he laughed at it.

1287
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,559
And of Gloucester's treachery.

1288
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,039
When I informed him
he called me sot.

1289
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,159
And told me
I had turned the wrong way out.

1290
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:23,559
Back, Edmund, to the troops.

1291
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,559
Hasten your musters
and conduct your powers.

1292
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,280
This trusty servant
shall pass between us.

1293
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,720
Ere long you are like to hear
a mistress's command.

1294
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,439
Wear this.

1295
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,800
Spare speech.

1296
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,160
Decline your head.

1297
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:52,759
This kiss, if it durst speak,

1298
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,760
would stretch thy spirits
up into the air.

1299
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,680
Conceive...

1300
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,120
And fare...thee...well.

1301
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,760
Yours, in the ranks of death.

1302
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,320
My most dear Gloucester.

1303
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,560
Oh...

1304
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,720
The difference of man and man.

1305
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,440
To thee a woman's services are due.

1306
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,679
A fool usurps my bed.

1307
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,680
Madam, here comes my lord.

1308
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,079
I have been worth the whistle.

1309
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,679
Oh, Goneril, you are not worth
the dust

1310
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,399
which the rude wind
blows in your face.

1311
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,559
No more, the text is foolish.

1312
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:04,319
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem
vile, filths savour but themselves.

1313
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:08,479
Milk-livered man, where's thy drum?

1314
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,919
France spreads his banners in our
noiseless land, whilst thou,

1315
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,999
a moral fool, sits still and cries,
"Alack, why does he so?"

1316
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,839
See thyself, devil!

1317
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:23,560
Proper deformity shows not in
the fiend so horrid as in woman!

1318
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,400
Oh...

1319
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,320
..vain...

1320
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,640
..fool.

1321
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,879
To both these sisters
have I sworn my love.

1322
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:43,320
Each jealous of the other
as the stung are of the adder.

1323
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,440
Which of them shall I take?

1324
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,719
Both?

1325
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,719
One?

1326
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,640
Or neither?

1327
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:57,760
Neither can be enjoyed
if both remain alive.

1328
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,760
Tell me but truly
but then speak the truth.

1329
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,120
Do you not love my sister?

1330
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,119
In honoured love.

1331
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,319
But have you never found

1332
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,079
my brother's way to the forfended
place?

1333
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,199
That thought abuses you.

1334
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,720
No, by mine honour, madam.

1335
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,079
I never shall endure her.

1336
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,359
Dear, my lord,

1337
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,400
be not familiar with her.

1338
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,400
Fear me not.

1339
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,119
She and the Duke, her husband.

1340
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,519
Our very loving sister, well bemet.

1341
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,879
Sir, this I heard.

1342
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,919
The King is come to his daughter,

1343
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,319
with others whom the rigour
of our state forced to cry out.

1344
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,800
<font color="yellow">It touches us, as France invades
our land.</font> Sir, you speak nobly.

1345
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,639
Why is this reasoned?

1346
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,239
Combine together 'gainst the enemy,

1347
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,999
for these domestic
and particular broils

1348
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,599
are not the question here.

1349
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,040
Let's then determine
on our proceeding.

1350
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,120
Sister, you'll go with us? No.

1351
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,000
'Tis most convenient.
Pray, go with us.

1352
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,960
Oh, I know the riddle.

1353
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,800
I will go.

1354
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:32,479
Oh, thou good Kent, how can I live
and work to match thy goodness?

1355
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,079
My life will be too short
and every measure fail me.

1356
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,679
To be acknowledged, madam,
is o'erpaid.

1357
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,319
All my reports go with
the modest truth,

1358
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,360
nor more, nor clipped, but so.

1359
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,040
Oh, my dear father...

1360
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:11,559
..restoration hang thy medicine
on my lips and let this kiss

1361
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,439
repair those violent harms
that my two sisters

1362
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,120
have in thy reverence made.

1363
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,240
He wakes.

1364
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,879
Speak to him.

1365
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,840
Madam, do you. 'Tis fittest.

1366
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,760
How does my royal lord?

1367
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,320
How fares Your Majesty?

1368
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,040
You do me wrong...

1369
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,440
..to take me out of the grave.

1370
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,559
Thou art a soul in bliss,
but I am bound

1371
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,319
upon a wheel of fire
that mine own tears

1372
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,600
do scald like molten lead.

1373
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,200
Sir, do you know me?

1374
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,000
You are a spirit, I know.

1375
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,200
Where did you die?

1376
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,999
Still far, far, wide.

1377
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,160
He's scarce awake.
Let him alone awhile.

1378
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,040
Where have I been? Where am I?

1379
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,760
Fair daylight?

1380
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,840
I am mightily abused.

1381
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,760
I should even die with pity
to see another thus.

1382
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,520
I know not what to say.

1383
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,439
I will not
swear these are my hands.

1384
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,480
Let's see, I feel this pin prick.

1385
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,800
Would I were assured
of my condition.

1386
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,199
Oh, look upon me, sir,

1387
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,600
and hold your hand
in benediction o'er me.

1388
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,599
You must not kneel.

1389
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,400
Pray, do not mock me.

1390
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,759
I am a very foolish fond old man,

1391
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,520
fourscore and upward,
not an hour more, nor less...

1392
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:42,160
..and, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

1393
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:50,279
Methinks I should know you
and know this man.

1394
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,879
Yet I am doubtful
for I am mainly ignorant

1395
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,599
what place this is
and all the skill I have

1396
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,559
remembers not these garments.

1397
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,800
Nor I know not where I did lodge
last night.

1398
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,120
Do not laugh at me.

1399
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,600
For, as I am a man...

1400
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,760
..I think this lady
to be my child...

1401
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,240
..Cordelia.

1402
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,799
And so I am....I am.

1403
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,599
Be your tears wet?

1404
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:30,040
I pray thee, weep not.

1405
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,159
If you have poison for me,
I will drink it.

1406
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,559
I know you do not love me,
for your sisters

1407
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,079
have, as I do remember,
done me wrong.

1408
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,159
You have some cause, they have not.

1409
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,240
No cause...no cause.

1410
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,760
Ha!

1411
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,080
Am I in France?

1412
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,880
<font color="yellow">In your own kingdom, sir.
</font><font color="cyan">Do not abuse me.</font>

1413
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:09,160
Be comforted, good madam. The great
rage, you see, is killed in him.

1414
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:15,839
<font color="lime">Desire him to go in.</font> Will it please
Your Highness walk?

1415
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,079
Aha.

1416
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,440
You must bear with me.

1417
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:25,120
Pray you now, forget and forgive.

1418
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,920
I am old...

1419
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,560
..and foolish.

1420
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:52,080
If ever I return to you again,
I'll bring you comfort.

1421
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,319
Grace go with you, sir.

1422
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,639
On va chercher toutes cette zones.

1423
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,519
Apres nous pouvons deployer
si vous voulez

1424
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,719
nos troupes a cote du chateau...

1425
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:45,519
Away, old man,
give me thy hand, away!

1426
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,839
King Lear hath lost, he and his
daughter taken. Give me thy hand.

1427
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,679
Come on.

1428
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:55,240
No further, sir,
a man may rot even here.

1429
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:03,240
Men must endure their going hence
even as their coming hither.

1430
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,040
Ripeness is all.

1431
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,599
Right left. Lo right,
lo right, lo right, lo right.

1432
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:39,200
Right here. Lo right, lo right,
lo right, lo right...

1433
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,239
We are not the first

1434
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,319
who with best meaning
have incurred the worst!

1435
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:56,439
Shall we not see these daughters
and these sisters?

1436
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,839
No, no, no, no.

1437
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,879
Come, let's away to prison.

1438
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,759
Ha, we two alone will sing
like birds in the cage.

1439
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:08,399
When thou dost ask me blessing,
I'll kneel down

1440
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
and ask of thee forgiveness.

1441
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,079
And so we'll live,

1442
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,359
and pray, and sing, and tell
old tales and laugh

1443
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,559
at gilded butterflies.

1444
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,479
And hear poor rogues

1445
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:25,039
talk of court news
and we'll talk with them, too,

1446
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,520
who loses and who wins,
who's in, who's out.

1447
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,040
And take upon us the mystery
of things...

1448
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,680
..as if we were God's spies.

1449
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:43,559
And we'll wear out
in a walled prison

1450
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,120
packs and sects of great ones
that ebb and flow by the moon.

1451
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:57,280
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia...

1452
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:05,640
..the gods themselves throw incense.

1453
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,239
Hmm. Have I caught thee?

1454
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,399
He that parts us
shall bring a brand from heaven,

1455
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,480
and fire us hence like foxes.

1456
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,640
Wipe thine eyes.

1457
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,719
The good years shall devour them,
flesh and fell,

1458
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,120
ere they shall make us weep.

1459
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,600
We'll see 'em starved first.

1460
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,800
Come.

1461
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,239
One step I have advanced thee.

1462
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,639
If thou dost as this instructs thee,

1463
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:56,480
thou dost make thy way
to noble fortunes.

1464
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:13,319
Either say thou'lt do it
or thrive by other means.

1465
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,879
I cannot draw a cart
nor eat dried oats.

1466
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,120
If it be man's work, I'll do it.

1467
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,519
Sir, you have showed
today your valiant strain,

1468
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,879
and fortune led you well.

1469
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,399
You have the captives who were
the opposites of this day's strife.

1470
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,399
I do require them of you
so that we shall find their merits

1471
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,479
and our safety may equally
determine.

1472
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,679
Sir, I thought
it fit to send the old

1473
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,919
and miserable king
to some retention.

1474
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,559
At this time we sweat and bleed.

1475
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:51,119
The friend hath lost his friend,
and the best quarrels in the heat

1476
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,879
are cursed by those
that feel their sharpness.

1477
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:58,559
The question of Cordelia and her
father requires a fitter place.

1478
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,759
Sir, by your patience, I hold you
but a subject of this war,

1479
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,439
<font color="yellow">not as a brother.
</font>He led our powers,

1480
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:07,079
bore the commission
of my place and person,

1481
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,039
the which immediacy
may well stand up

1482
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,599
and call itself your brother.

1483
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,639
Not so hot.

1484
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:15,639
In his own grace, he doth exalt
himself more than in your addition.

1485
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:20,999
In my rights, by me invested,
he compeers the best.

1486
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,519
That were the most
if he should husband you.

1487
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,399
Jesters do oft prove prophets.
Uh-uh.

1488
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,359
That eye that told you
so looked but asquint.

1489
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,999
Lady, I am not well,
else I should answer

1490
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,320
from a full flowing stomach.

1491
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:47,039
General, take thou my soldiers,
prisoners, patrimony.

1492
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,880
Dispose of them, of me,
these walls are thine.

1493
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,879
Witness the world that I create thee
here, my lord and master.

1494
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:59,879
The let alone lies not in your good
will. <font color="cyan">Nor in thine, lord.</font>

1495
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:03,839
<font color="yellow">Half blooded fellow, yes.
</font>Prove my title thine.

1496
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,719
Edmund, I arrest
thee on capital treason,

1497
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:08,239
and in thy attaint
this gilded serpent.

1498
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,719
<font color="lime">An interlude.
</font><font color="yellow">Let the challenge sound.</font>

1499
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:13,159
If none appear to prove upon
thy person thy heinous,

1500
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,239
manifest and many treasons,
here is my pledge.

1501
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,799
<font color="yellow">I'll make it on my heart.
</font><font color="cyan">There's my exchange.</font>

1502
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,079
What in the world he is
that names me traitor,

1503
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,079
villain like he lies.

1504
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,839
He that dares approach,

1505
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,479
on him, on you, who not,

1506
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,159
I will maintain
my truth and honour firmly.

1507
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:33,919
Let the challenge sound.

1508
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,240
My sickness grows upon me.

1509
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,400
She is not well,
convey her to my room.

1510
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:56,479
If any man of quality or degree
within the lists of the army

1511
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,399
will maintain upon Edmund,
supposed Earl of Gloucester,

1512
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:04,960
that he is a manifold traitor,
let him appear!

1513
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,440
What sayest thou?

1514
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,920
Thou art a traitor.

1515
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,599
False to thy gods,

1516
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,080
thy brother, and thy father.

1517
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,960
Back do I toss these treasons
to thy head.

1518
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,040
Get up! Get up.

1519
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,759
Thou art not vanquished
but cheated and beguiled!

1520
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,880
Shut your mouth, dame.

1521
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,159
<font color="lime">No!</font> Go with her.

1522
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,640
She's desperate.

1523
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,040
What you have charged me with...

1524
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,279
..that have I done,

1525
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,880
and more, much more.

1526
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:19,959
But what art thou?

1527
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:22,680
I am no less in blood
than thou art, Edmund.

1528
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:24,960
My name is Edgar...

1529
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,239
..and thy father's son.

1530
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:30,039
The wheel is come full circle.

1531
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,840
I am here.

1532
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,319
Oh, that my heart would burst.

1533
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,320
Help, help!

1534
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,039
Well, speak, man.

1535
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,080
This knife...

1536
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,119
This knife came even
from the heart of...

1537
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:52,240
Well, who man?
Speak! <font color="cyan">Your lady, sir.</font>

1538
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,679
Your lady.

1539
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,520
And her sister by her is poisoned.

1540
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,279
She confesses it.

1541
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,400
Produce the bodies.
Be they alive or dead.

1542
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,839
Go on.

1543
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,680
I was contracted to them both.

1544
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:12,520
All three now marry in an instant.

1545
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:23,040
I am come to bid my King and master
aye goodnight.

1546
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,840
Is he not here?

1547
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,880
Seest thou this object, Kent?

1548
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,919
I pant for life.

1549
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,600
Quickly send...

1550
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:49,080
..for my writ is on the life of
Lear and on Cordelia.

1551
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,039
Send in time!
Haste thee for thy life!

1552
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,720
Bear him hence!

1553
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,600
Howl!

1554
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,280
Howl!

1555
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,040
Howl!

1556
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:20,840
Howl!

1557
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:25,480
Oh, you are men of stones.

1558
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,559
Had I your tongues and eyes,
I'd use them so

1559
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,720
that heaven's vault should crack.

1560
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,760
She's gone for ever.

1561
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:25,639
I know when one is dead
and when one lives.

1562
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,920
She's dead as earth.

1563
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:35,680
This feather stirs, she lives.

1564
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:46,239
If it be so, it is a chance
which does redeem all sorrows

1565
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,719
that ever I have felt.

1566
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:55,439
<font color="lime">Oh, my good master.</font> <font color="cyan">Prithee, away.
</font><font color="yellow">'Tis noble Kent, your friend.</font>

1567
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:00,360
A plague upon us,
murderers, traitors all.

1568
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:06,160
I might have saved her,
now she's gone...

1569
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:09,400
..for ever.

1570
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,879
Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little.

1571
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,320
Ha? What is't thou sayest?

1572
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:29,320
Her voice was ever soft, gentle and
low, an excellent thing in a woman.

1573
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,399
I killed the slave that was
a hanging thee.

1574
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,400
<font color="cyan">Did I not, fellow?
</font>'Tis true my lords, he did.

1575
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:50,319
I have seen the day,
with my good biting falchion,

1576
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,159
I would have made them skip.

1577
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,200
I am old now

1578
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,160
and these same crosses spoil me.

1579
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,840
This is a dull sight.

1580
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,160
Who are you?

1581
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:19,479
Mine eyes are not of the best, I'll
tell you straight. Are you not Kent?

1582
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:22,959
The same, your servant Kent.

1583
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,680
Where is your servant, Caius?

1584
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:31,159
He's a good man, I'll tell you that.
He'll strike, and quickly, too.

1585
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:36,039
<font color="cyan">He's dead and rotten.</font> No,
my good lord, I am the very man...

1586
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:39,039
<font color="cyan">I'll see that straight.</font> ..that
from your first of difference

1587
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,439
and decay
have followed your sad steps.

1588
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,519
You are welcome hither.

1589
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,919
He knows not what he says and vain
is it that we present us to him.

1590
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,479
My lords and noble friends,
know our intent.

1591
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:52,919
What comfort to this great decay
may come shall be applied.

1592
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:56,599
For us, we will resign
during the life of this old majesty

1593
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,680
to him our absolute power
Oh, see, see!

1594
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,439
And...

1595
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:08,360
..and my poor fool is hanged.

1596
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:14,440
No, no, no life.

1597
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,040
Why should a dog, a horse,
a rat have life...

1598
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,400
..and thou no breath at all?

1599
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,080
Thou'lt come no more.

1600
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,320
Never.

1601
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,079
Never.

1602
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:47,199
Never. Never. Never...

1603
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,400
Pray you, undo this button.

1604
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,400
Thank you, sir.

1605
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,759
See this?

1606
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:10,639
Look...on her, her lips.

1607
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,520
Look there, look there.

1608
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,320
He faints.

1609
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,840
My lord?

1610
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,079
My lord...

1611
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,640
Oh. Break, heart. I prithee, break.

1612
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,279
Look up, my lord.

1613
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,359
Vex not his ghost. Oh, let him pass.

1614
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:35,279
He hates him that would upon
the rack of this tough world

1615
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,400
stretch him out longer.

1616
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:50,960
He is gone indeed.

1617
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:04,440
The wonder is
he hath endured so long.

1618
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:09,360
He but usurped his life.

1619
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:31,879
Friends of my soul,
you twain rule in this realm

1620
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,760
and the gored state sustain.

1621
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,360
I have a journey, sir,
shortly to go.

1622
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:42,120
My master calls me,
I must not say no.

1623
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:11,080
The weight of this sad time
we must obey.

1624
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,400
Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.

1625
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,400
The oldest hath borne most.

1626
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,399
We that are young

1627
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,960
shall never see so much...

1628
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,200
..nor live so long.
