威廉·莎士比亞 作品

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:01:08,760
李     爾     王

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,400
-肯特  -伯爵
-Kent. -My lord.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
走這邊
Come on.

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
我原本以為奧本尼公爵會比康華爾公爵更被王上看中
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,280
我們倒是一向都這麼認為 但在這次的國土分割中
It did always seem so to us, but now in the division of the kingdom

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,080
卻看不出他更加青睞誰
it appears not which of the dukes he values most,

11
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,600
這次分配如此平均
for qualities are so weighed

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,920
兩位公爵再斤斤計較 都沒法說對方比自己受益更多
that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety.

13
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,760
公爵 這是令郎嗎
Is not this your son, my lord?

14
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,480
實話告訴您 他的出生我要負全責
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge.

15
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
我過去經常面紅耳赤地承認他是我的兒子 但現在我已經釋然了
I've so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it.

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
我不太明白您的意思
I cannot conceive you.

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,320
這個小伙子的媽媽可以讓您搞清楚是怎麼回事
Sir, this young fellow's mother could.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,440
雖然這個混小子自作主張地來到人世
Though this knave came something saucily into the world,

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,920
卻不得不說生下他的那個女人是個尤物
我們在製造他的時候曾經有過一場刺激的遊戲
there was good sport at his making and the whoreson must be acknowledged.

20
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,520
-埃德蒙 你認識這位大人嗎 -不認識 公爵
-Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund? -No, my lord.

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,400
他是肯特公爵  從此刻起你應當時牢牢記住他是我尊貴的友人
My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,640
他在國外待了九年 不久之後還會再次出去
He has been out nine years and away he shall again.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
國王駕到
The king is coming.

24
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,120
葛羅斯特 你去接待一下法蘭西國王和勃艮第伯爵
Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

25
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,840
是  陛下
Ay, my good lord.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,200
與此同時 我要和你們說說我心中那見不得光的計劃
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,880
把那份地圖拿給我
Give me the map there.

28
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,120
告訴你們 國土已經被我劃分成了三份
Know that we have divided in three our kingdom.

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,240
我年歲也不小了 該要快些卸下身上的擔子才是
'Tis our fast intent to shake all cares and business from our age,

30
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,640
把這些事情交給年輕一輩來做
conferring them on younger strengths,

31
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,760
這樣才好一身輕鬆地慢慢走向死亡
while we unburdened crawl toward death.

32
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,400
康華爾伯爵 還有你 榮寵不比他少的奧本尼公爵 我的兩位好女婿
Our son of Cornwall, and you, our no less loving son of Albany,

33
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,120
我想此時我應該公佈我的女兒們到底有多少嫁妝
we have this hour a constant will to publish our daughters' several dowers,

34
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,320
以防日後發生爭執
that future strife may be prevented now.

35
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,240
法蘭西的王子和勃艮第公爵為了得到我小女兒的垂青正爭得火熱
The princes France and Burgundy, great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,640
他們已經懷揣著熱情似火的心在我這裏住了有些時日了
long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,640
他們現在該得到答覆了
and here are to be answered.

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
告訴我吧 女兒們
Tell me, my daughters,

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,880
值此之際 我即將放棄我的統治 我的領土 和諸多國事
since now we will divest us both of rule, interest of territory, cares of state,

40
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,080
讓我來聽聽 你們之中哪一個最愛我
which of you shall we say doth love us most,

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,000
讓我們看看誰對我有與生俱來的愛 看看誰將因此得到最高的獎賞
that we our largest bounty may extend where nature doth with merit challenge?

42
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,120
戈納瑞 你是老大 你先說
Goneril, our eldest born, speak first.

43
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
父親……
Sir...

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,760
我對您的愛 再多的言語都不夠表達
I love you more than words can wield the matter.

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,640
我珍視您勝過我的雙眼 熱愛您勝過愛這大千世界
對您的嚮往 更甚於我對自由的追求
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,400
超越一切可以估價的貴重稀有的事物
beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,360
更不亞於對一個擁有恩惠 財富 健康 美貌和榮譽的生命的渴求
no less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour,

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,360
沒有哪個孩子如此愛她的父親 也從未有過哪個父親 被女兒這樣深愛
as much as child e'er loved, or father found,

49
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,960
這種愛讓唇舌無力 言語在它面前都失去了意義
a love that makes breath poor and speech unable.

50
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,240
我愛您 超越了一切可以表達愛的方式 我愛您
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,000
在我國土的這些疆界以內
Of all these bounds,

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,880
從這條線起 一直到這一條為止 這其中所有茂密的森林 肥沃的平原
even from this line to this, with shadowy forests and with champains riched,

53
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,160
豐盈的河流 和廣袤的牧場
with plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,

54
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
你就是他們的女主人了
we make thee lady.

55
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,600
這塊土地是你和奧本尼的 也將被你們的子孫世世代代所擁有
To thine and Albany's issue be this perpetual.

56
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,680
來聽聽我的二女兒 親愛的裏根 康華爾的夫人 是怎麼說的
What says our second daughter, our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall?

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
來吧
Speak.

58
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,840
呃……我和我的姐姐有著相似的品質 您憑著她 就能得出對我的判斷
Er... I am made of that self mettle as my sister, and prize me at her worth.

59
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,240
我真誠地覺得 姐姐剛才的一番話 將我對你那不可名狀的愛具像化了
In my true heart, I find she names my very deed of love.

60
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,840
只可惜姐姐說的話還不足以完全表達我對您的愛
Only she comes too short:

61
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,520
我厭棄這世上所有
that I profess myself an enemy to all other joys

62
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,680
凡是敏銳知覺能感受到的愉悅和快樂
which the most precious square of sense possesses,

63
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,080
只有沐浴在您無上的榮寵裏 我才真的開心和幸福
and find I am alone felicitate in your dear highness' love.

64
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,480
那麼你和你的子孫將會世代繼承
And to thee and thine hereditary ever

65
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,720
這塊從我們偉大王國的國土中 劃分出來的三分之一的肥沃土地
remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,

66
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,160
你的土地和我剛劃分給戈納瑞的同樣廣闊 同樣肥沃 一點兒不比她差
no less in space, validity and pleasure than that conferred on Goneril.

67
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,040
現在該輪到我的小寶貝兒了 雖然是最後一個發言 但也一樣我心尖兒上的女兒
Now our joy, although the last and least,

68
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,960
那法蘭西的葡萄和勃艮第的牛奶
to whose young love the vines of France and milk of Burgundy

69
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,880
都想得到你那充滿青春活力的愛情
strive to be interessed.

70
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
你有什麼要說的話 可以為你贏得比你兩個姐姐更為富饒的土地呢
What can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters?

71
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,000
說吧
Speak.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,840
父親 我沒話說
Nothing, my lord.

73
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,880
-沒有話要說     -沒有
-Nothing?  -Nothing.

74
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
但不說話你就什麼都換不到了 （給你個機會 好好想想）重新再說一次吧
Well, nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.

75
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,400
我很難過 因為我沒辦法把我的心意送到嘴邊
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth.

76
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,600
我對陛下的愛 謹遵您賜予我的名分 一分不多 一分不少
I love your majesty according to my bond, no more nor less.

77
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,800
怎麼這樣說話 考狄利婭 把你的話修正一下 否則你將毀掉你的命運
How now, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little, lest you may mar your fortunes.

78
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,800
是 父親 您賜予我生命 養育我 疼愛我
Ay, my good lord, you have begot me, bred me, loved me.

79
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
為了報答您 我會履行我的責任：
I return those duties back as are right fit:

80
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,480
順從您 愛您 敬重您
obey you, love you, and most honour you.

81
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,600
如果姐姐們真像她們所說的那樣愛您 她們為什麼要嫁給別人呢
Why have my sisters husbands if they say they love you all?

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,280
我絕對不會像姐姐們一樣嫁給別人 我要用全部的身心來愛您 我的父親
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters to love my father all.

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,480
你說這些都是真心話嗎
But goes thy heart with this?

84
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,920
句句真心 父親
Ay, my good lord.

85
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,600
你年紀這麼小 怎會如此沒有良心
So young, and so untender?

86
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,800
父親 我年紀小 但我有一顆赤誠的真心
So young, my lord, and true.

87
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,800
那我就成全你的真心 你就用你那高貴的真誠當作嫁妝吧
Let it be so. Thy truth then be thy dower.

88
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,240
我發誓從現在起 你我再無半點關係 不是父女 不是親人
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,

89
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,440
從此你在我心裏只是一個毫不相干的旁人 我這輩子都不會改變心意了
and as a stranger to my heart and me hold thee from this for ever.

90
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,920
-陛下……-閉嘴 肯特
-Good my liege... -Peace, Kent!

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,840
不要觸碰我的逆鱗
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.

92
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,360
我愛她最深 我還曾想在她的細心照顧下 頤養天年
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest on her kind nursery.

93
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,840
走開 別再讓我看到你
Hence, and avoid my sight!

94
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,800
把法蘭西王叫來 怎麼一個個都不動 把勃艮第也叫來
Call France. Who stirs? Call Burgundy!

95
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,200
哈哈
Ha, ha!

96
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,720
康華爾和奧本尼
你們倆已經得到了我兩個女兒的嫁妝 現在把這第三份也拿去分了吧
Cornwall and Albany, with my two daughters' dowers digest the third.

97
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,960
（至於考狄利婭） 就讓她那所謂的坦誠 為她找一個丈夫吧

98
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
我兩位傑出而優秀的女兒們 我把我的權利
I do invest you jointly with my power, pre-eminence,

99
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,000
我的影響力 連同作為君主的權威 一起交給你們
and all the large effects that troop with majesty.

100
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,960
而我 我只為自己保留……
Ourself by monthly course, with reservation of...

101
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,360
一百名騎士 由你們來供養我
an hundred knights, by you to be sustained,

102
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,560
我將每個月輪流到你們的領地去居住
shall our abode make with you by due turn.

103
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,440
我只給自己留下國王的名義和各種尊號頭銜
Only we still retain the name and all the addition to a king.

104
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,200
所有的統治權 財政大權 處理大小事務的權力 兩位賢婿 我把它交給你們
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest, beloved sons, be yours.

105
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,240
李爾陛下 我一向敬您為我的君王
Royal Lear, whom I have ever honoured as my king,

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,120
奉您為我的偉大保護神……
as my great patron thought on in my prayers...

107
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,120
箭已然在弦上 弓已經被拉滿 你就留心怎麼躲開箭鋒吧
The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,400
那就儘管讓它射過來吧 就算箭鏃會戳進我的心臟
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade the region of my heart.

109
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,640
既然您已經失去理智了 我也只好失禮了
Be Kent unmannerly when Lear is mad?

110
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
你到底想怎樣 老頭
What wouldst thou do, old man?

111
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,400
你以為當權威被諂媚者奪走時 盡忠職守的人就不敢說話了嗎
Thinkest thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows?

112
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,400
肯特 住嘴 你還想不想保命了
Kent, on thy life, no more!

113
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
我的生命原本是向你仇敵拋擲的武器
My life I never held but as a pawn to wage against thine enemies.

114
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,520
-走開 -先生 冷靜一點……
-Out of my sight! -Dear sir, forbear...

115
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,120
-好好把事情看清楚些 李爾 -現在 以太陽神阿波羅起誓……
-See better, Lear! -Now, by Apollo...

116
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,520
哦我的國王 現在你以阿波羅的名義起誓
Oh, now, by Apollo, king.

117
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,080
你向神神明發誓也沒用 我告訴你 你是個惡魔
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain. I'll tell thee, thou dost evil.

118
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
聽著 懦夫
Hear me, recreant.

119
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,640
懷著你對我的忠誠給我聽好了
On thine allegiance, hear me!

120
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,480
你妄想慫恿我違背我剛發過的誓言 這是我們從來都不敢做的
That thou hast sought to make us break our vows, which we durst never yet,

121
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,560
為了維護我王權的尊嚴 你將接受應得的懲罰
our potency made good, take thy reward.

122
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,160
我給你五天時間 讓你準備些衣服和食物
Five days we do allot thee, for provision

123
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,880
免得你飽受這世上飢餓和寒冷或者疾病的痛苦
to shield thee from diseases of the world,

124
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,440
第六天 你那可憎的身體必須離開我的國土
and on the sixth to turn thy hated back upon our kingdom.

125
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,640
如果在此後的十天之內
If, on the tenth day following,

126
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,200
在我的領土上發現了你的蹤跡 那就是你的死期
thy banished trunk be found in our dominions, the moment is thy death.

127
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,040
走吧 以丘比特之神的名義
Away, by Jupiter.

128
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
這個決定是絕對不可更改的
This shall not be revoked!

129
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,200
我尊貴的陛下 法蘭西王和勃艮第來了
Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord!

130
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,600
尊敬的陛下
My noble lord.

131
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,760
勃艮第公爵
My Lord of Burgundy,

132
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,080
我先來和你說說 你和法蘭西國王都在爭奪我的女兒
we first address towards you, who with this king hath rivalled for our daughter.

133
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,920
你希望她至少要有多少陪嫁的奩資
What in the least will you require in present dower with her

134
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,160
否則你寧願捨棄你對她的愛
or cease your quest of love?

135
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,560
我尊貴的陛下 您提出的數目我就已經很滿足了 不會再奢求更多
Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness offered,

136
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,240
想來您也不會吝嗇的 陛下
nor will you tender less.

137
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,600
尊貴的勃艮第 當我還十分寵愛她時 她對我來說是十分珍貴的
Right noble Burgundy, when she was dear to us, we did hold her so.

138
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,720
但現在她已經掉價了
But now her price is fallen.

139
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,000
先生 你看她 就站在那兒 看起來那麼小一個東西
Sir, there she stands. If aught within that little seeming substance,

140
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,200
要是我能給她的只有憎恨
or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,

141
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,840
再沒有別的了 如果這樣了你還是喜歡她
and nothing more, may fitly like your grace,

142
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,520
她就在那兒 她就屬於你了
she's there, and she is yours.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
我不知道該怎麼回答您
I know no answer.

144
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,920
像她這樣一個軟弱無能 無親無故 又才遭受我的憎恨的女孩兒
Will you with those infirmities she owes, unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,760
我的詛咒就是她的嫁妝 而且我已立誓和她斷絕關繫了
dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath,

146
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,920
-你願意娶她嗎 還是就此放棄  -請您寬恕 陛下
-take her or leave her? -Pardon me, royal sir.

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,960
在這樣的情況下 我是很難抉擇的
Election makes not up in such conditions.

148
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,360
那就放棄她把 公爵
就憑著賜予我生命的神靈起誓 我已經告訴你了她的全部價值
Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me I tell you all her wealth.

149
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,040
至於你 偉大的國王
For you, great king,

150
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,720
為了你我珍貴的友誼 我是萬不會講一個我如此憎惡的人許配給你的
I would not from your love make such a stray to match you where I hate.

151
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
陛下 我懇請您讓世人明白
I yet beseech your majesty that you make it known

152
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,240
不是罪惡的污點、謀殺 或是卑鄙的行為
it is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,

153
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,480
也不是不貞潔或不光彩的做法
no unchaste action or dishonoured step

154
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,640
讓我一下子就失去了您的厚愛
that hath deprived me of your grace and favour.

155
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,800
你最好從沒來到過這世上……
Better thou hadst not been born...

156
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,960
總比像今天這樣惹惱我要好得多
than not to have pleased me better.

157
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
尊敬的勃艮第伯爵 你對她意下如何呢 你會娶她嗎
My Lord of Burgundy, what say you to the lady? Will you have her?

158
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
只要您給我之前所允諾的那份嫁妝
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,

159
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,040
我就可以讓她成為勃艮第公爵夫人
and I will make Cordelia Duchess of Burgundy.

160
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,680
我什麼都不能給你了 我已經發過誓 我絕不會違背誓言
Nothing. I have sworn, I am firm.

161
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,400
這樣的話 我只能說很抱歉了
I am sorry, then.

162
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,280
你已經失去了一個父親 現在又得失去一個丈夫了
You have so... lost a father that you must lose a husband.

163
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
願和平伴隨著勃艮第國土
Peace be with Burgundy.

164
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,880
既然名望和財富才是他心中所愛 那我也不能作他的妻子
Since that respect and fortunes are his love, I shall not be his wife.

165
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
最美麗的考狄利婭
Fairest Cordelia,

166
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,560
現在我將她連同她的美德一起握在手裏
thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.

167
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,600
那你把她帶走吧 法蘭西王
Thou hast her, king.

168
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
讓她成為你的妻子
Let her be thine,

169
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,440
我沒有這樣的女兒 以後也不會想再見到她了
for we have no such daughter, nor shall ever see that face of hers again.

170
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
那麼你們去吧 你們不需要我的恩惠 我的愛
Therefore be gone, without our grace, our love,

171
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,320
我的祝福
our benison.

172
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
跟我走
Come!

173
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
和你的姐姐們好好道別吧
Bid farewell to your sisters.

174
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,560
好好愛戴我們的父親
Love well our father.

175
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
用不著你來說我們該做什麼
Prescribe not us our duty.

176
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,160
你還是好好費心該怎麼侍奉你的丈夫吧 慈悲的命運把你交付到他手裏
Let your study be to content your lord, who hath received you at fortune's alms.

177
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,400
我覺得我們的父親今晚就會離開
I think our father will hence tonight.

178
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,480
那是肯定的 他會先和你住在一塊兒 下個月到我們那兒
That's most certain, and with you. Next month with us.

179
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
你也看見了 他上了年紀 脾氣更加變幻莫測 他向來最疼愛我們的妹妹
You see how full of changes his age is. He always loved our sister most

180
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,280
今天居然一氣之下想也不想把她攆走 可見他已經是多麼糊塗了
and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.

181
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,320
年紀大了難免會這樣 可他一直以來都是這麼喜怒不定的
'Tis the infirmity of his age, yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.

182
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,560
他還是健康的青壯年時 脾氣就暴躁魯莽的很
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash.

183
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,800
如果我們的父親慣著自己的脾氣濫用權威 這一次劃分國土的事情
If our father carry authority with such disposition as this,

184
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,080
說不定什麼時候反倒會讓我們遭殃
it will but offend us.

185
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,120
-我們得對此作長遠打算 -我們必須得趁熱打鐵做點兒什麼
-We shall further think on it. -We must do something, and i' the heat.

186
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
祈禱吧 這次讓我們姐妹同心
Pray, let us hit together.

187
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,800
你 大自然 是我的女神啊
Thou, Nature, art my goddess.

188
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,080
我願受你的法律約束
To thy law my services are bound.

189
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,360
為什麼我是私生子
Why bastard?

190
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,640
為什麼我比別人卑賤 明明我的各個方面都和他們沒有差別
Wherefore base, when my dimensions are as well compact,

191
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,920
我慷慨的精神 莊健的體格 端正的容貌 哪一點比不上正經女人生的孩子
my mind as generous and my shape as true as honest madam's issue?

192
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,480
為什麼他們要給我貼上卑賤的標籤
Why brand they me with base?

193
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440
為什麼要說我是賤種 是私生子
With baseness? Bastardy?

194
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,200
合法的哥哥 埃德伽 我一定要得到你的土地
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.

195
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,320
我合法的哥哥
Well, my legiti-mate,

196
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,760
我 愛德蒙 這個私生子 有朝一日會把你壓在腳下
Edmund the base shall top the legitimate.

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
不好意思 失陪一下
Excuse me.

198
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,360
埃德蒙 怎麼了 有什麼新消息嗎
Edmund, how now? What news?

199
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,080
父親 我不知道有什麼新聞啊
I know no news, my lord.

200
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,160
-你手上讀的那封信是什麼 -沒什麼 父親
-What paper were you reading? -Nothing, my lord.

201
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,400
什麼都沒有
No?

202
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,840
要是沒什麼的話 你為何要慌慌張張把它塞進你的衣袋
What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?

203
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,560
要是上面真的沒有什麼的話 它根本就不必被藏起來
The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself.

204
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,400
來 拿出來給我看看吧 要是上面沒有什麼的話我也不需要戴眼鏡了
Let's see. Come, if it be nothing I shall not need spectacles.

205
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,120
我懇求您 父親 請您原諒我
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.

206
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,600
這是哥哥寫給我的信 但我還沒有讀完
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read,

207
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,960
從我已經讀到的內容看 我覺得你還是不要讀的好
and for so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.

208
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,440
小伙子 把信給我
Give me the letter, sir.

209
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
唉……
Hmm...

210
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,640
「要是我們的父親在我把他叫醒之前一直好好睡著
"If our father would sleep till I waked him,

211
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,400
你就可以一直享有他一半的收入
you should enjoy half his revenue for ever

212
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,920
並且生活在你哥哥我的疼愛之中 埃德伽」
and live the beloved of your brother. Edgar."

213
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,960
「在我把他叫醒之前一直好好睡著……享受他一半的收入 」我的兒子埃德伽
"Sleep till I waked him... Enjoy half his revenue." My son Edgar?

214
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,160
-這封信是什麼時候到你手裏的 誰把信帶給你的  -我在我的房間裏發現的
-When came you to this? Who brought it? -I found it in my room.

215
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,920
你認得這是你哥哥的筆跡
You know the character to be your brother's?

216
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,920
要是信中所言都是些好東西 父親 我敢發誓是他的筆跡
If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his,

217
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,920
但鑒於信上寫的是這種話 我倒寧願不是他寫的
but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.

218
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,600
-可這就是他的筆跡  -這個的確是他的筆跡 父親
-It is his. -It is his hand, my lord,

219
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,280
但我希望他說這些話的時候心裏並沒有真的這麼想
but I hope his heart is not in the contents.

220
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,240
他以前從沒有用這類似的話試探過你
Has he never before sounded you in this business?

221
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,440
從沒有 父親 可我常常聽他提起
Never, my lord, but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit

222
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,880
兒子成年以後父親也已經衰老了
that, sons at perfect age and fathers declined,

223
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,080
於是父親應該受到兒子的監視 讓兒子來管理他的財產
the father should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue.

224
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,520
哦 真是個混蛋
O villain!

225
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,360
混蛋 他在信裏說的就是這個意思
Villain. His very opinion in the letter.

226
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,440
-去把他給我找來 他在哪兒 -我不是很清楚 父親
-Go seek him. Where is he? -I do not well know, my lord.

227
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,960
最近出現的這些日食月食果然不是什麼好兆頭
These late eclipses of the sun and moon portend no good to us.

228
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,760
我們的好日子已經不復返了
We have seen the best of our time.

229
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,880
找到這個混蛋 埃德蒙
Find out this villain, Edmund.

230
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
這對你也沒什麼不好的
It shall lose thee nothing.

231
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,280
行動的時候小心些
Do it carefully.

232
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,240
人們最愛用這種華而不實的想法蒙騙自己
This is the excellent foppery of the world,

233
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
當我們應為自己不當的行為而遭遇不測時
that when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour,

234
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,080
我們將自己受到的災禍歸因於日月星辰
we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars,

235
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,920
就好像我們成為罪人是命中注定 成為傻瓜也是上天的旨意
as if we were villains of necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion,

236
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,040
人們變成無賴 小偷 叛國賊 好像都有一顆星球在背後操縱
knaves, thieves and treasoners by spherical predominance,

237
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,040
酗酒 造謠
drunkards, liars,

238
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,720
通姦 好像大家是被迫受到了行星的影響
and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence,

239
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,560
無論我們犯下什麼罪惡的行徑
都好像是因為有一種神秘的力量在背後主導著一切
and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on.

240
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,960
一切如何啊 我的弟弟埃德蒙
How now, brother Edmund?

241
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,920
這些日食月食果然預示著紛爭與決裂
O these eclipses do portend these divisions.

242
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,920
你又在思考什麼嚴肅的事情啊
What serious contemplation are you in?

243
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,200
我在想 哥哥 關於我最近讀到的一個預言
I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day.

244
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
說的是 這些日食月食之後 將會發生什麼
What should follow these eclipses.

245
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,720
你就讓這些東西困擾著你嗎
Do you busy yourself with that?

246
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,560
我向你保證 他一語成讖
I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily.

247
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,840
你最近一次看見父親是什麼時候
When saw you my father last?

248
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,600
呃……昨天晚上
Er... The night gone by.

249
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,960
你和他說過話沒有
Spake you with him?

250
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,760
說了 我和他交談了兩個小時
Ay. Two hours together.

251
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,360
你沒有在他的言辭表情之間感受到一點惱怒嗎
Found you no displeasure in him by word nor countenance?

252
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,640
一點兒也沒有
None at all.

253
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,000
想想看你是不是在什麼地方得罪了他
Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him,

254
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,200
聽我的勸 暫時避開他一下
and at my entreaty forbear his presence

255
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,760
等他的怒氣稍微平息一點再說
until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure,

256
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,680
他現在正在氣頭上
which at this instant so rageth in him

257
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
說不定會對你造成什麼傷害呢
that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay.

258
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,600
-一定是有哪個壞東西在背後詆毀我 -這也是我所憂慮的
-Some villain hath done me wrong. -No, that's my fear.

259
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,040
我現在還是想請你和我到我住的地方去
I pray you retire with me to my lodging,

260
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
我可以想法子讓你藏起來 聽聽他老人家怎麼說
from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.

261
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
算我求你了 快走吧
Pray ye, go.

262
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,040
這是我的鑰匙 你要是在外面走動的話 最好帶些武器
There's my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed.

263
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,960
武器 弟弟……
Armed? Brother...

264
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,600
哥哥 我勸你最好這麼做
Brother, I advise you to the best.

265
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,840
我已經把聽到看到的都告訴你了 但我說的也只是輕描淡寫
I have told you what I have seen and heard but faintly,

266
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,080
實際情況比我說的嚴重多了
nothing like the image and horror of it.

267
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,680
求你了 快走吧
-Pray you, away. -

268
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,920
一個輕信讒言的父親 和一個高貴的哥哥
A credulous father and a brother noble,

269
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,320
他如此善良的本性使得他不會懷疑任何人
whose nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none.

270
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
我可要揚眉吐氣了
I grow, I prosper.

271
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,080
現在 眾神幫幫私生子吧
Now, gods, stand up for bastards.

272
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
-我能很快從你這裏得到消息嗎   -一切交給我來辦
-Shall I hear from you anon? -I do serve you in this business.

273
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,480
被放逐的肯特
Now, banished Kent,

274
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,720
要是你頂著一身罪名 還依然能夠盡忠心
if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,

275
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,960
總有一天 你的主人
so may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,

276
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,160
會體察到你的功勞
shall find thee full of labours.

277
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,520
不要耽擱 立刻開始晚餐吧
Let me not stay a jot for dinner!

278
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,040
-怎麼回事兒 你是誰   -一個人 先生
-How now, what art thou? -A man, sir.

279
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,640
喔 你是做什麼的
Oh. What dost thou profess?

280
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,760
你看我像做什麼的 我就是做什麼的
I do profess to be no less than I seem.

281
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,280
嗯...  你想幹嘛   -為您服務
-Hm... What wouldst thou? -Service.

282
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,600
為誰服務   -您
-Who wouldst thou serve? -You.

283
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,320
夥計 你認識我嗎   -不認識 先生
-Dost thou know me, fellow? -No, sir.

284
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,800
但是您的神情
But you have that in your countenance

285
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,560
讓我有一股願意為之臣服的氣質
which I would fain call master.

286
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,600
那是什麼氣質
What's that?

287
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,280
-威嚴  -啊
-Authority. -Ah.

288
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,600
那好 跟著我吧 你可以侍奉我
Well, follow me. Thou shalt serve me.

289
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,720
如果晚飯後 我還是這麼喜歡你 我就不會讓你走了
If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.

290
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,360
晚餐   晚餐
-Dinner ho!  Dinner ho!

291
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,200
晚餐   晚餐
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

292
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,760
晚餐   晚餐   晚餐   晚餐
Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

293
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,720
晚餐   晚餐   晚餐   晚餐   晚餐
Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

294
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,680
晚餐   晚餐
Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

295
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,920
晚餐   晚餐  晚餐   晚餐
Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho! Dinner ho!

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
晚餐   晚餐
Dinner ho! Dinner!

297
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,960
我的跟班兒在哪兒呢 我的傭人呢
Where's my knave, my fool? Eh?

298
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,240
進去把我的傭人叫來
Go you and call my fool hither.

299
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,560
你 你 就是你
Ah. You, sir, you.

300
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,640
小子 我的女兒哪裏去了
You! Sirrah, where's my daughter?

301
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,120
不好意思
So please you.

302
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,720
那個傢伙在說什麼  把那個蠢貨叫回來
What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.

303
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,200
我的傭人呢?  全都睡著了嗎
Where's my fool? I think the world's asleep. Hm.

304
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
他從早到晚都要責備我
By day and night he wrongs me.

305
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,280
每個小時他都要挑起新的事端 把我們這裏攪得雞犬不寧
Every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds.

306
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,120
-我受不了了
-I'll not endure it.

307
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,680
他的騎士日益橫行不法 而且他經常因為一點點小事就責備我們
His knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us on every trifle.

308
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
救說我病了
Say I am sick.

309
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,920
你儘管對她擺出一副不理不睬的樣子
Put on what weary negligence you please.

310
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,520
他要是惱了 就讓他去我妹妹那
If he distaste it, let him to my sister,

311
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,000
我知道他她跟我一樣 不願受到欺壓
whose mind and mine I know in that are one, not to be overruled.

312
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
好的,夫人
Well, madam.

313
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,240
-怎麼回事 那個雜種在哪  -他說你女兒身體不適 陛下
-Where's that mongrel? -He says your daughter is not well.

314
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,120
我喊他過來的時候 那個奴才為什麼不過來
Why came not the slave back when I called him?

315
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,400
-大人 他非常放肆的回答我說 他不想過來
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.

316
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,320
-他不想
-He would not?   Ooh...

317
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,800
去告訴我的女兒 說我有話要跟她說
Go and tell my daughter I would speak with her.

318
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,240
-你去把我的傭人叫來 -是
-Go you, call hither my fool. -Sir.

319
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,960
啊 是你 你過來
O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir.

320
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
知道我是誰嗎  先生
Who am I, sir?

321
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,480
-我女主人的父親 -我女主人的父親
-My lady's father. -My lady's father?

322
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,520
我們陛下的奴才 你個婊子養的狗東西 你這個奴才 你這個雜種
My lord's knave, you whoreson dog, you slave, you cur.

323
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,720
請您原諒 陛下 我並不是你所說的那些
I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your pardon.

324
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,680
-竟敢跟我瞪眼 你這無賴 -你不能打我 陛下
-Bandy looks with me, rascal? -I'll not be struck, my lord.

325
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,440
也不能絆你嗎 你這踢足球的下賤東西
Nor tripped neither, you base football player!

326
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,000
感謝你夥計 你幫了我 我非常喜歡你
I thank thee, fellow. Thou servest me, and I'll love thee.

327
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
站起來 快滾
Come, sir, arise, away.

328
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,160
滾  滾
Away, away.

329
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,240
讓我也把他雇下來吧 這是我的雞冠帽
Let me hire him, too.

330
00:23:14,960 --> 00:00:04,000
啊 我的乖乖
-Here's my coxcomb. -How now, my pretty knave?

331
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,400
-你好嗎 -夥計 你最好接過我的雞冠帽
-How dost thou? -Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

332
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,000
-為什麼  為什麼
-Why, Fool? -Why?

333
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,360
這個夥計已經趕走了他的兩個女兒
This fellow has banished two of his daughters

334
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,400
賜福於第三個女兒
and did the third a blessing against his will.

335
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,120
你如果要跟隨他 必須帶上我的雞冠帽
If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.

336
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,040
啊 老伯
How now, nuncle?

337
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,840
真希望我有兩頂雞冠帽和兩個女兒
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters.

338
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
為什麼   孩子
Why, boy?

339
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,880
如果我把我所有的傢俬都給了她們 至少我的雞冠帽還是我的
If I gave them all my living I'd keep my coxcombs myself.

340
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,800
這頂是我的 再去你的女兒那裏討一頂吧
There's mine. Beg another of thy daughters.

341
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,760
不准叫我傻瓜 小子
Dost thou call me fool, boy? Eh?

342
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,360
你把其他所有的尊號都送了別人
All thy other titles thou hast given away.

343
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
只有這一個是與生俱來
That thou wast born with.

344
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,800
他說的不完全是蠢話 陛下
This is not altogether fool, my lord.

345
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,840
你什麼時候開始這麼喜歡唱歌的 小子?
When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

346
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,280
老伯 自從你把你的女兒當做母親 我就常常唱起歌了
I have used it, nuncle, e'er since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers.

347
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,200
小子 我們要鞭打你
Sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

348
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,640
我不知道你跟你的女兒們究竟是什麼親戚
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.

349
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
他們會因為我說的是真話而鞭打我
They'll have me whipped for speaking true,

350
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,760
你又因為我說謊而鞭打我
thou'lt have me whipped for lying.

351
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,760
有時我還會因為沉默而被鞭打
And sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace.

352
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,480
我寧願做任何事也不願做傻瓜
I had rather be any kind of thing than a fool.

353
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,040
但我寧可做個傻瓜 也不願意做你 老伯
-And yet I would not be thee, nuncle

354
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,840
你把你的聰明從兩邊削去 削的中間什麼都不剩
Thou hast pared thy wit on both sides and left nothing in the middle.

355
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,400
瞧 那削下的一塊來了
Here comes one of the parings.

356
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,800
嗯
Hm.

357
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,520
怎麼了 女兒 為什麼你的臉上寫滿怒氣
How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on?

358
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,440
我看你近來老是皺著眉頭
Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.

359
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,240
不光是這個肆無忌憚的傭人
Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,

360
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,680
還有你那些蠻橫的隨從 時時叫囂挑釁
but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel,

361
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,240
種種不法的暴行 實在叫人忍無可忍
breaking forth in rank and not-to-be-endured riots.

362
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,400
父親 我本來以為 只要讓你瞭解這些事情
Sir, I had thought by making this well known unto you

363
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,520
就能找到補救的辦法
to have found a safe redress

364
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,160
可照你自己最近的所言所行來看
but now grow fearful, by what yourself too late have spoke and done,

365
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,680
你分明是在為他們撐腰 有意縱容這種惡行
that you protect this course and put it on by your allowance.

366
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,960
你還是我的女兒嗎
-Are you our daughter? Hm?

367
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,560
我希望你明智一點
I would you would make use of your good wisdom

368
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,680
你最近總是心懷不滿
whereof I know you are fraught

369
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,480
動不動就亂發脾氣
and put away these dispositions

370
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,560
這樣實在有失一個做長輩的體統
which of late transport you from what you rightly are.

371
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,760
馬被車子拖著走的時候 就算一頭蠢驢也能發現事情顛倒了
May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?

372
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
呼 玖格 我愛你!
Whoop, Jug, I love thee!

373
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,000
這裏有人認識我嗎?
Does any here know me?

374
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,840
這不是李爾嗎
This is not Lear.

375
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,760
是李爾在走路嗎 在說話嗎
Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?

376
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
他的眼睛呢?
Where are his eyes?

377
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,760
他的知覺迷亂了嗎 他的神智麻木了嗎
Either his notion weakens, or his discernings are lethargied.

378
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,480
哈,還醒著嗎?
Ha, waking?

379
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,720
沒有的事
'Tis not so.

380
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,560
誰能告訴我我是誰?
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

381
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,360
李爾的影子
Lear's shadow.

382
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
你叫什麼名字 小姐?
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

383
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,720
-哈
-Huh?

384
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,320
父親 近來您就喜歡開這樣的玩笑
This admiration, sir, is much o'th'savour of other your new pranks.

385
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,840
我懇求你明白我的苦衷
I do beseech you to understand my purposes aright.

386
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,560
您這樣一個可敬的長者 應該明智一些
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.

387
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,560
您在這裏養的一百個騎士和隨從
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires,

388
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,280
全都是些胡鬧放蕩 膽大妄為之輩
men so disordered, so debauched and bold

389
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,440
好好的宮廷被他們的任意妄為攪得像個鬧哄哄的客棧
that this our court, infected with their manners, shows like a riotous inn.

390
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,720
噢
Oh...

391
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,720
所以請您依了我的要求
Be then desired by her that else will take the thing she begs

392
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,680
酌量減少您的隨從人數吧
a little to disquantity your train.

393
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,680
地獄裏的魔鬼 把我的侍從全招集起來
Darkness and devils! Call my train together.

394
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,640
沒有良心的混賬 我不會麻煩你了
Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee.

395
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,880
我還有一個女兒呢
Yet have I left a daughter.

396
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,120
你打我的傭人 而你那班烏合之眾膽敢對上位者呼來喝去
You strike my people and your rabble make servants of their betters.

397
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,680
唉 後悔的太晚了!
Woe that too late repents!

398
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,240
啊 你也來了
O, you, sir, you, are you come?

399
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,440
這是你的意思嗎 告訴我
Is it your will? Speak, sir.

400
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,040
陛下請不要生氣 科迪莉亞只是犯了一些微不足道的錯誤
- Pray, sir, be patient. - O most small fault,

401
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,840
怎麼在我眼裏變得如此醜惡
how ugly didst thou in Cordelia show,

402
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,840
像一座強力的機器 扭曲了我的天性
which, like an engine, wrenched my frame of nature from the fixed place,

403
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,800
抽乾了我心裏的慈愛
drew from my heart all love,

404
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,200
灌入了苦澀的怨恨
and added to the gall.

405
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,160
李爾 李爾 李爾!痛打這糊塗腦袋吧
O Lear, Lear, Lear! Beat at this gate that let thy folly in

406
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,880
這歡迎愚蠢 趕走智慧的糊塗腦袋
and thy dear judgement out.

407
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
我的人跟我走
Go, go, my people!

408
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,280
陛下 我是無辜的 我不知道你為什麼如此生氣
My lord, I am guiltless as I am ignorant of what hath moved you.

409
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,400
也許不是你的錯 公爵
It may be so, my lord.

410
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,800
聽著 造化的女神 聽我的哭訴
Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!

411
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,400
如果你想使這畜生生兒育女 請改變你的旨意吧
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend to make this creature fruitful.

412
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,880
剝奪她生育的能力!
Into her womb convey sterility!

413
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,920
使她的器官枯竭
Dry up in her the organs of increase,

414
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,160
讓他卑賤的身軀永遠生不出一個子女來使他享受榮耀
and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honour her.

415
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,320
如果她必須生產 請讓她生下一個忤逆的孩子
If she must teem, create her child of spleen,

416
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,680
讓那個孩子成為他終生的折磨
that it may live and be a thwart disnatured torment to her.

417
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,880
讓她年輕的額角過早刻上皺紋
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,

418
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,360
這樣他就能體會到 有一個忘恩負義的孩子
that she may feel how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is

419
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,960
比毒蛇的牙齒更令人痛入骨髓
to have a thankless child.

420
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,080
走吧 我們走
Away, away!

421
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,240
我的老天爺 這到底是怎麼回事
Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

422
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,720
你不用知道原因
Never afflict yourself to know more of it,

423
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,080
由著他發脾氣吧
but let his disposition

424
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,760
喂 你 你這小子
O you, you, sirrah!

425
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,000
還不到半個月 就把我的隨從一下子裁撤了50名嗎
What, fifty of my followers at a clap, within a fortnight?

426
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,920
-什麼事 陛下? -我待會兒告訴你
- What's the matter, sir? - I'll tell thee!

427
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,840
我真感到慚愧 你就有力量撼動我的大丈夫氣概
Life and death! I am ashamed that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus.

428
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,840
願毒風和惡霧襲擊你
Blasts and fogs upon thee!

429
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,800
願一個父親的詛咒刺透你的五官百竅 留下深不可測的瘡痍
The untented woundings of a father's curse pierce every sense about thee!

430
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,280
就這樣吧 我還有一個女兒
Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter...

431
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,200
…我敢肯定 他是一個善良、孝順的人
...who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable.

432
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,360
她聽見你這樣對待我
When she shall hear this of thee,

433
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,560
一定會用指甲抓破你豺狼一樣的臉
with her nails she'll flay thy wolvish visage.

434
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,600
你會發現我將恢復原狀
Thou shalt find that I'll resume the shape

435
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,200
你以為我一輩子都做不到了
which thou dost think I have cast off for ever.

436
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,720
但我會重振雄風 你等著瞧吧
Thou shalt, I warrant thee.

437
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,120
走吧 我們走
Away, away.

438
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,920
你聽到了嗎
Do you mark that?

439
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,480
雖然我十分愛你 可是我不能這樣偏心 戈納瑞
I cannot be so partial, Goneril, to the great love I bear you...

440
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,120
隨你的便吧
Pray you, content.

441
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,680
奧斯瓦德
Oswald!

442
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,440
你這七分奸三分傻的人 跟上你的主人
You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master!

443
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,160
李爾老伯 李爾老伯 等等
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry.

444
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,040
-一百個騎士  -帶上傭人一起走
- A hundred knights? -Take the fool with thee!

445
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,280
讓他隨身帶著一百個騎士 可真是萬全之計
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep at point a hundred knights!

446
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,880
只要他做了一個夢 聽了一句謠言 轉了一個念頭 心生不快不滿
Yes, that on every dream, each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,

447
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,720
這老糊塗便會耍性子 憑他們的力量 把我們的性命置於股掌間
he may enguard his dotage with their powers and hold our lives in mercy.

448
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,480
奧斯華德 喊你呢
Oswald, I say!

449
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,800
也許你多慮了
Well, you may fear too far.

450
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,600
總比大意穩當
Safer than trust too far.

451
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,680
我知道他想什麼
I know his heart.

452
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,080
他所說的話我已寫在給我妹妹的信上了
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister.

453
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,840
如果她不聽我勸告
If she sustain him and his hundred knights

454
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,840
還要收留他和那一百個騎士
when I have showed th'unfitness...

455
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,600
奧斯華德 去找我妹妹 告訴她我特別害怕
Oswald, away to my sister. Inform her full of my particular fear,

456
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,800
此外 你自己再添幾條理由 讓其更令人信服
and thereto add such reasons of your own as may compact it more.

457
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,640
你快去快回
Get you gone, and hasten your return.

458
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,560
如果一個人的腦筋長在腳跟上 難道他就不會有凍瘡的危險嗎
If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger of chilblains?

459
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,840
會啊 孩子
Ay, boy.

460
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,800
那你高興點兒吧
Then, I prithee, be merry.

461
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,840
你的腦筋又不用穿了拖鞋走路 唉唉
Thy wit shall not go slipshod. Oy oy!

462
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,760
你能說出一個人的鼻子為什麼長在臉中間嗎?
Thou canst tell why one's nose stands in the middle of one's face?

463
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
不知道
No.

464
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
還能為什麼呢 為了把兩眼睛各放一邊呀
Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose...

465
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,040
額
Ah...

466
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,920
鼻子聞不出的東西 可以用眼睛瞧個仔細
...that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.

467
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,880
唉唉
Oy oy!

468
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,080
我對不起她
I did her wrong.

469
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,360
你知道牡蠣怎樣造它的殼嗎
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

470
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
不知道
No.

471
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
我也不知道
Nor I neither.

472
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
但是我知道為什麼蝸牛有房子
But I can tell why a snail has a house.

473
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,120
-為什麼?-為了把腦袋放進去
-Why? -Why, to put's head in.

474
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,600
為了不把它送給女兒 害自己無處安頓
Not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case.

475
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,480
我也顧不上什麼天性了
I will forget my nature.

476
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,200
我這父親待他們這麼好
I'm so kind a father.

477
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
北斗七星為什麼只有七星
The reason why the seven stars

478
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,840
其中有個絕妙的理由
are no more than seven is a pretty reason.

479
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,160
因為沒有第八顆嗎
-Because they are not eight. -Yes, indeed.

480
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,920
你會成為一個好傭人的
Thou wouldst make a good fool.

481
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,880
忘恩負義的禽獸
Monster ingratitude.

482
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,160
如果你是我的傭人 老伯
If thou wert my fool, nuncle,

483
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,600
我要把你打一頓 因為你還沒到你的年紀 你就老了
I'd have thee beaten for being old before thy time.

484
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,840
怎麼說
How's that?

485
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,040
你應該懂些世故再老呀
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.

486
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,920
哦 我不要發瘋
O, let me not be mad.

487
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,080
不是發瘋 上天啊
Not mad, sweet heavens.

488
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,960
按耐住怒火
Keep me in temper.

489
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,400
我不要瘋掉
I would not be mad.

490
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,440
車馬已備好 陛下
- Ready, my lord.

491
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,760
來吧,男孩
Come, boy.

492
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,440
哥哥,聽我說句話
Brother, a word.

493
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,160
下來 哥哥
Ascend, brother, I say.

494
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,280
你快逃離這裏
O sir, fly this place.

495
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,160
有眼線告訴了他你的藏身之處
Intelligence is given where you are hid.

496
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,200
康沃爾公爵馬上就要來了 他和裏甘一起來了
The Duke of Cornwall's coming hither now, in haste and Regan with him.

497
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,720
-你真的沒有說什麼反對他的話嗎 ?  -我真沒有
-Have you nothing said upon his party? -I am sure of it...

498
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,240
-噓  -我沒說過
-Sh... -Not a word.

499
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,960
我聽到父親過來了
I hear my father coming.

500
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,560
救命   救命
Help! Help!

501
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,240
快逃 我的哥哥 逃吧
-Fly, brother! Fly!

502
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
來人啊
Help!

503
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,280
來人啊
Help!

504
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,320
我曾經見過醉漢 鬧著玩兒的割破皮肉 那可比這要厲害
I've seen drunkards do more than this in sport.

505
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
來人
Help!

506
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,200
來人
Help!

507
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,080
各就各位
Take your positions!

508
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,720
-那個畜生在哪 -他站在這黑暗中
-Where is the villain? -Here stood he in the dark,

509
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,520
喃喃地念著邪惡的咒語 見神見鬼地請月亮幫他的忙
mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon to stand auspicious mistress.

510
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,280
-他在哪裏?-看 父親 我流血了
-But where is he? -Look, sir, I bleed.

511
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,680
那個惡棍在哪兒 埃德蒙
Where is the villain, Edmund?

512
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,840
-往那邊逃了 父親 他見自己無法
Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could...

513
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,840
抓住他  快    快追
Pursue him! Ho! Go after!

514
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,640
「無法」怎樣
"By no means" what?

515
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,240
無法說服我謀害您
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship.

516
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,200
他永遠不會逍遙在外 抓到了就叫他活不成
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught, and found, dispatch.

517
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,600
是公爵 我要關閉所有的城門 公爵一定會答應我的要求
It is the duke. All ports I'll bar, the duke must grant me that.

518
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
那不孝子逃不掉的
The villain shall not 'scape.

519
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,960
我忠誠孝順的孩子
And of my land, loyal and natural boy,

520
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,440
我會想法子讓你繼承我的土地
I'll work the means to make thee capable.

521
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,720
怎麼了 伯爵
How dost, my lord?

522
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,840
啊 夫人 我這顆年老的心已經碎了 碎了
O madam, my old heart is cracked, 'tis cracked.

523
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,560
什麼 我父親的教子要取你性命
What, did my father's godson seek your life?

524
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,200
噢 夫人 夫人 這種事真叫人丟臉
O lady, lady, shame would have it hid.

525
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,240
他和我父親那幫橫行不法的騎士 不是常在一起嗎
Was he not companion with the riotous knights that tended upon my father?

526
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,400
-我不知道 夫人 太糟糕了 太糟糕了 -是的 夫人 他常和那夥人混在一起
-I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad. -Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

527
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,240
哦 那就不足為奇了 受了那種壞影響
Oh, no marvel then though he were ill affected.

528
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,440
今晚我收到了我姐姐的信了
I have this present evening from my sister

529
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,360
他們的行徑她全告訴我了
been well informed of them and with such cautions

530
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,440
還警告我 他們要是想住到我家裏來 我最好別在家
that if they come to sojourn at my house, I'll not be there.

531
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,600
我也不會呆在家裏的 相信我 裏根
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.

532
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,160
愛德蒙  我聽說你很孝敬你的父親
Edmund, I hear you have shown your father a child-like office.

533
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,000
這是身為兒子的本分 殿下
It was my duty, sir.

534
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,840
您看他手臂上的傷 就是因為想要抓住那畜生而受的
He received this hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

535
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,320
派人去追捕他了嗎 - 已經去追了 殿下
-Is he pursued? -Ay, my good lord.

536
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,920
如果抓住他了 我們一定不會再讓他造次
If he be taken, he shall never more be feared of doing harm.

537
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,240
至於你 愛德蒙
For you, Edmund,

538
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,840
你的那忠孝天性值得讚賞 我們正需要值得信賴的人 你是頭一個被我們選中的
natures of such deep trust we shall much need. You we first seize on.

539
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,760
殿下 我願意為您盡忠效命
I shall serve you, sir, truly, however else.

540
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,200
我代他感謝您的恩惠 謝謝您能看得起他
For him I thank your grace.

541
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,240
你還不知道我們為什麼造訪你
You know not why we came to visit you.

542
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,040
尊貴的葛羅斯特 我們趁著夜色前來
Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night,

543
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,440
如此不合時宜 實在是因為有些事情
occasions, noble Gloucester, of some prize,

544
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,720
必須請教一下您的意見
wherein we must have use of your advice.

545
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,240
-它們嗅到他的氣味了
- They've got the scent!

546
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,560
繼續搜 把他找出來
Go on, find him!

547
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,640
往前走 一直搜
Forwards! Keep moving forwards!

548
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,160
-你是這屋的人嗎 朋友  -是的
-Art of this house, friend? -Ay.

549
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,960
-車停在哪好  -停泥地裏吧
-Where may we stop? -In the mire.

550
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,120
行行好 大家都是朋友 告訴我吧
I prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.

551
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,880
-誰是你的朋友   -我才不想理你
-I love thee not. -Why, then I care not for thee.

552
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,000
要是我們打一架 看你理不理我
If I had thee in a ring I'd make thee care for me.

553
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,920
你為什麼對我這樣 我根本不認識你
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.

554
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,960
-你這傢伙 我可認識你 -你知道我什麼
-Fellow, I know thee. -What dost thou know me for?

555
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,760
一個無賴 流氓
A knave, a rascal,

556
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,920
一個下賤的、狂妄的、淺薄的 像個
a base, proud, shallow, beggarly,

557
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,480
只有三套衣服 身家不過百鎊的乞丐 穿著精仿襪的卑鄙無賴
three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy worsted-stocking knave.

558
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,920
你這可怕的傢伙 為什麼要罵我
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one

559
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,840
我們壓根都不認識
that neither knows thee nor is known of thee.

560
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,960
還說你不認識我 你臉皮真厚
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me.

561
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,520
我曾把你踢倒在地 還在王上的面前打過你
I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king.

562
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,040
我要在月光底下把你剁得稀爛 你這個混蛋
I'll make a sop of the moonlight of you, you whoreson.

563
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,840
滾開 我和你半毛錢關係都沒有
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

564
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,720
你這混蛋
You rascal!

565
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,120
你讓一個傀儡女兒反對她的父王 你這混蛋
You take the puppet's part against the royalty of her father, you rogue.

566
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,720
-救命啊 殺人啦 救命啊
-Help! Murder! Help! -

567
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,120
-站住 你這混蛋 站住 你這奴才
-Stand, you rogue! Stand, you slave!

568
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,600
救命啊
Help!

569
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,560
-救命!救命!-怎麼了 出什麼事了
-Help! Help! -How now, what's the matter?

570
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,320
好小子 你也想挨拳頭吧
With you, goodman boy!

571
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,400
要是你來 我也會揍你 來吧 小主人
If you please come, I'll beat ye. Come on, young master!

572
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,680
-這發生什麼事了 - 馬上住手 否則小心你們的命
-What's the matter here? -Peace, upon your lives!

573
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
違令擅動者死
He dies that strikes again!

574
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,600
-發生什麼事了
-What is the matter?

575
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,440
這一個從我姐姐和國王那兒來的信使
The messenger from our sister and the king.

576
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,320
你的身份有什麼不同 說吧
What is your difference? Speak.

577
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,320
殿下 這個老惡棍 我已經饒了他的命
Sir, this ancient ruffian, whose life I have spared...

578
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,920
你這個混球 你多此一舉的信
You whoreson zed, you unnecessary letter...

579
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,480
住口 小子 難道你不懂規矩嗎
Peace, sirrah! Know you no reverence?

580
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,880
-我當然知道規矩 殿下 可我實在氣不過 也就顧不得了 -你為什麼這樣生氣
-Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege. - Why art thou angry?

581
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,720
我生氣世上竟還有像他這般毫無忠誠可言的奴僕
That such a slave as this should walk the world, who wears no honesty.

582
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
-他做錯什麼了 - 我就不喜歡他的嘴臉
- What is his fault? -His countenance likes me not.

583
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,680
也許你也不喜歡我的面孔、他的面孔
No more perchance does mine, nor his,

584
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,920
還有她的面孔
nor hers.

585
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,720
我曾經見過一些面孔
I have seen better faces in my time

586
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,960
比現在我面前的這一張張嘴臉好的太多了
than stands on any shoulder that I see before me at this instant.

587
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,600
你這固執的老賊
You stubborn, ancient knave.

588
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,520
讓我們好好教教你該怎麼說話做事
We'll teach you.

589
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,360
我可是王上的人
I serve the king!

590
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,320
憑著我的生命和榮譽起誓 他必須像這樣跪在這裏直到...明天中午為止
As I have life and honour, here shall he stay until... noon?

591
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,440
到中午
Till noon?

592
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,080
到明天夜裏 殿下
Till tomorrow night, my lord.

593
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,960
為什麼 夫人 就算我是您父親的狗 您也不該這樣對待我
Why, madam, if I was your father's dog, you should not use me so.

594
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,880
正是因為他的走狗 我才這樣對你
Sir, being his knave, I will.

595
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,560
這正是我們的姐姐說起過的那個傢伙
This is a fellow of the selfsame colour our sister speaks of.

596
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,600
王上一定會心生不快
The king his master needs must take it ill

597
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,080
要是知道您如此輕蔑他的人
that he, so slightly valued in his messenger,

598
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,640
-把他像這樣捆起來
-should have him thus restrained.

599
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,400
我會負責的
I'll answer that.

600
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,680
我的姐姐要是知道她的使者被人這樣侮辱毆打 肯定心裏更加不快
My sister may receive it much more worse to have her gentleman abused, assaulted.

601
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,400
-走吧 -撤下
- Come, away. -Dismissed!

602
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,120
很抱歉 朋友 我會替你求情的
I'm sorry for thee, friend. I'll entreat for thee.

603
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,760
請別這麼做 大人
Pray do not, sir.

604
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,160
（您遭到這般對待）是公爵的不是 王上一定會見怪的
The duke's to blame in this. 'Twill be ill taken.

605
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,840
我聽見了內心深處的呼喚
I heard myself proclaimed.

606
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,760
愛德伽
Edgar!

607
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,880
愛德伽
Edgar...

608
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,680
我...什麼都
I... nothing...

609
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,080
不是
am.

610
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,680
他頭戴著吊帶襪
He wears cruel garters.

611
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,120
祝福您 尊貴的主人
Hail to thee, noble master.

612
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,720
是誰認錯人了 把你鎖在這
What's he that hath so much thy place mistook to set thee here?

613
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,880
是他倆 您的女婿和女兒
It is both he and she, your son and daughter.

614
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,640
-不可能 -就是他們
-No. -Yes.

615
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,680
-我說了不可能是他們 -就是他們
-No, I say. -I say, yea.

616
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,200
-憑著朱庇特起誓 不可能有這樣的事 -憑著朱諾起誓 確有其事
-By Jupiter, I swear no. -By Juno, I swear ay.

617
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,480
我那女兒呢 快給我的僕從鬆綁
Where is this daughter? Give me my servant forth!

618
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,680
拒絕和我說話
Deny to speak with me?

619
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,920
他們是病了 累了 還是整夜奔波
They are sick? They are weary? They have travelled all the night?

620
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,360
哈 僅僅是想知道
Ha! Mere fetches.

621
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,920
這是要反叛逃離的意思
The images of revolt and flying off.

622
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,160
給我一個更好的回答
Fetch me a better answer.

623
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,240
去告訴公爵和他的妻子 我現在就要和他們講話
Go tell the duke and his wife I'd speak with them, now, presently.

624
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,920
叫他們出來聽我說話
Bid them come forth and hear me,

625
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
否則我在房間門口一直敲鼓 吵得他們睡不著 直到他們求饒為止
or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum till it cry sleep to death.

626
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,960
我但願你們之間相安無事
I would have all well betwixt you.

627
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,440
哦 我的心 我狂躁的心..冷靜一下
O me, my heart, my rising heart... But down...

628
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
你向它吆喝吧 老伯伯
Cry to it, nuncle,

629
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,200
就像廚娘把活鰻魚放進麵糊裏時候的那樣
as the cockney did to the eels when she put 'em in the paste alive.

630
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,280
她拿起手裏的棍子在它們的頭上敲打 大喊道
She knapped 'em on their coxcombs with a stick and cried,

631
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,920
「下去 壞東西 下去 」
"Down, wantons, down!"

632
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,320
哦 二位早安
Oh, good morrow to you both.

633
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,520
祝福您 陛下
Hail to your grace.

634
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,240
-很高興看見您-裏根 我想你一定高興看見我的
-I am glad to see your highness. -Regan. I think you are.

635
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,560
我完全有理由這麼想
I have good reason to think so.

636
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
你被放出來啦
Oh, are you free?

637
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,520
你姐姐對我太不敬了
Thy sister's naught.

638
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,040
裏根 她的無情的兇惡像餓鷹的利喙一樣猛啄我的心
O Regan, she hath tied sharp-toothed unkindness like a vulture here.

639
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,280
我幾乎沒法兒告訴你
I can scarce speak to thee.

640
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,280
你不會相信她墮落了到什麼地步
Thou'lt not believe with how depraved a quality...

641
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,600
-哦 裏根 - 我懇求您 忍著點兒吧
-O Regan! -I pray you, sir, take patience.

642
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,120
我想她不會對您有失敬
I have hope you less know how to value her desert

643
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,800
而恐怕是您不能諒解她的苦心
than she to scant her duty.

644
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,560
這是什麼意思
Say, how is that?

645
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,000
我想姐姐決不會有什麼地方不盡孝道
I cannot think my sister in the least should fail her obligation.

646
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,160
要是她管束了您那班隨從的放蕩的行為
If, sir, perchance she hath restrained the riots of your followers,

647
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,720
自然有充分的理由 絕對不能怪她的
'tis on such ground and to such wholesome end as clears her from all blame.

648
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,640
我詛咒她
My curses on her.

649
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,960
父親 你也老了
O sir, you are old.

650
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,960
已經快到生命的盡頭了
Nature in you stands on the very verge of her confine.

651
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,560
應該讓一個比您自己
You should be ruled and led

652
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,400
更明白您的境況的人管教管教您
by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself.

653
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,720
我勸您還是回到姐姐那
Therefore I pray you that to our sister you do make return.

654
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,080
對她賠一個不是
Say you have wronged her.

655
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,120
請求她的原諒
Ask her forgiveness?

656
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,480
你看這樣像不像個樣子
Do you but mark how this becomes the house?

657
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,360
「好女兒 我承認我老了 不中用啦」
"Dear daughter, I confess that I am old. Age is unnecessary."

658
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,880
「我跪在地上請求你能賞給我幾件衣服穿 一張床睡 一些東西吃吧」
"On my knees I beg that you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food."

659
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,920
父親 別在這丟人現眼了
Sir, these are unsightly tricks.

660
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,840
回我姐姐那兒去吧
Return you to my sister.

661
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,120
我再也不會回去了 裏根
Never, Regan!

662
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,720
她撤了我一半的侍從 拿冷臉對我
She hath abated me of half my train, looked black upon me,

663
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,200
用她的毒蛇一般的嘴刺傷我的心
struck me with her tongue most serpent-like upon the very heart.

664
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,880
但願上天蓄積的憤怒
All the stored vengeances of heaven

665
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,800
-一起降在她無情無義的頭上 -呸呸呸 別說了
-fall on her ingrateful top! -Fie, sir, fie.

666
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,040
惡風吹打她的腹中的胎兒 讓它生下地來就是個瘸子
Strike her young bones, you taking airs, with lameness!

667
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,720
啊
Ah...

668
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,800
迅疾的閃電啊 用你眩目的火焰射進她傲慢的眼睛裏去吧
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes!

669
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,080
烈日的熏灼下蒸發的瘴氣啊 毀壞她的容顏
Infect her beauty, you fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun,

670
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,240
讓她容顏不在
to fall and blister!

671
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,520
天上的神明啊 您要是對我發起怒來 也會這樣咒我的
O the blest gods, so will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.

672
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,520
不 裏根 你永遠不會受我的詛咒
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.

673
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,040
你天性溫柔 絕不可能幹出這等冷酷殘忍的事
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give thee o'er to harshness.

674
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,600
你姐姐眼裏有股兇光 可是你的眼睛卻是溫柔而和藹的
Her eyes are fierce, but thine do comfort and not burn.

675
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,320
你最懂得孝道
Thou better knowest the offices of nature,

676
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,600
兒女的責任 禮貌和滴水之恩的感激
bond of childhood, effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.

677
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,400
你總還沒有忘記我曾賜給你一半的國土
Thy half of the kingdom hast thou not forgot, wherein I thee endowed.

678
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,640
父親 這就說遠了
Good sir, to the purpose.

679
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,840
是誰綁了我的人
Who put my man i' the stocks?

680
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,880
-你的女主人來了嗎 - 我
-Is your lady come? -I...

681
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,480
這是一個靠著主人暫時的得寵、狐假虎威
This is the slave whose easy, borrowed pride

682
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,520
倚勢凌人的奴才
dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.

683
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,840
-滾開 賤奴 不要讓我看見你! -這是什麼意思 陛下
-Out, varlet, from my sight! -What means your grace?

684
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,240
誰綁了我的僕人
Who stocked my servant?

685
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,680
裏根 我希望你並不知道這件事
Regan, I have good hope thou didst not know on it.

686
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,800
誰來了
Who comes here?

687
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
神明啊
O heavens!

688
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,440
要是你愛老人 你認為子女應該孝順他們的父母
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway allow obedience,

689
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,280
要是你自己也是老人 就不要無動於衷
if you yourselves are old, make it your cause.

690
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,080
降下你的憤怒來 幫我報仇吧
Send down and take my part.

691
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,640
看見我這一把鬍鬚 不覺得慚愧嗎
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?

692
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,680
啊裏根 你竟然願意跟她握手嗎
O Regan, will you take her by the hand?

693
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,800
為什麼不能跟我握手呢 我幹了什麼錯事
Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?

694
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,800
這並不違背您那輕率的言辭和陳舊的法案
All's not offence that indiscretion finds and dotage terms so.

695
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,720
啊 我的胸膛 你還撐得住嗎
O sides, you are too tough. Will you yet hold?

696
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,560
我的人怎麼給你們綁了起來
How came my man i' the stocks?

697
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,160
陛下 是我綁了他
I set him there, sir!

698
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,680
你 是你幹的嗎
You? Did you?

699
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,280
父親 行行好吧 您太軟弱了
I pray you, Father, being weak, seem so.

700
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,280
如果您現在仍舊回到姐姐那兒
If till the expiration of your month

701
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,320
撤掉您一半的侍從 等住滿了一個月
you will return and sojourn with my sister, dismissing half your train,

702
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,280
就住到我這兒來
come then to me.

703
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,000
我現在不在自己家
I am now from home

704
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,920
也沒有足夠的東西提供給您 滿足不了您的各種消遣
and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment.

705
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,880
回到她那兒去 裁撤五十名侍從 不
Return to her and fifty men dismissed? No!

706
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,240
勸我寄他們籬下 還不如勸我當奴僕
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to that detested groom.

707
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,040
悉聽尊便 父親
At your choice, sir.

708
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,240
我告訴你 女兒 不要把我逼急了
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.

709
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,440
我也不願再打擾你了 我的孩子 再會吧
I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell.

710
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,120
我們就此別過 從此不再相見
We'll no more meet, no more see one another.

711
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
噢
Oh!

712
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,520
可是你是我的肉、我的血、我的女兒
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter.

713
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,920
還不如說是我身體上的一個惡瘤 我不得不承認你是我的
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh, which I must needs call mine.

714
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,520
你是我的腐敗的血液裏的一個癤子、一個瘀塊
Thou art a boil, a plague sore,

715
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,960
一個腫毒的疔瘡
an embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood.

716
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,640
可是我不願責罵你
But I'll not chide thee.

717
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,040
報應到時候總會來的 我不會祈求它快些降到你身上
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.

718
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,480
我不會要求天雷把你劈死你 我也會向天神控訴你的忤逆
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.

719
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,720
你回去仔細想一想
Mend when thou canst.

720
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,520
趁早痛改前非
Be better at thy leisure.

721
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,960
我有耐心等你
I can be patient.

722
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,280
我可以帶著我的一百個騎士 跟裏根住在一起
I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights.

723
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,680
這不太可能
Not altogether so.

724
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,440
現在沒輪到我 我也沒有準備好合適招待您的禮數
I looked not for you yet, nor am provided for your fit welcome.

725
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,680
父親 聽我姐姐的話吧
Give ear, sir, to my sister.

726
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,720
看著您這種憤怒的樣子
For those that mingle reason with your passion

727
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,880
他們一定覺得您老了
must be content to think you old and so...

728
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,920
但姐姐清楚自己在做些什麼
But she knows what she does.

729
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,680
-你確定你這樣說話合適嗎  -父親 這是我真實的想法
-Is this well spoken? -I dare avouch it, sir.

730
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,680
怎麼 五十個侍從 這不是很好嗎
What, fifty followers? Is it not well?

731
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,200
再多一些有什麼用處 是的
What should you need of more, yea, or so many,

732
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,280
如此多的侍從花費和拉幫結派都是一件危險的事
sith that both charge and danger speak 'gainst so great a number?

733
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,280
一間屋子裏養了許多人 受著兩個主人支配 怎麼不會發生爭鬧
How in one house may many people under two commands hold amity?

734
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,840
這太難了 簡直不可能
'Tis hard, almost impossible.

735
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,800
父親 為什麼不呢
Why might not you, my lord,

736
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,440
裏根那找僕人或者我的人那裏找人侍候您
receive attendance from those that she calls servants or from mine?

737
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,280
為什麼不呢 請您只帶二十五個人來
Why not, my lord? I do entreat you to bring but five-and-twenty.

738
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,360
超過這個數目 我是恕不招待的
To no more will I give place or notice.

739
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,080
我把一切都給了你們
I gave you all...

740
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,920
您給的正是時候
And in good time you gave it.

741
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,360
叫你們做我的代理人、保管者
Made you my guardians, my depositories.

742
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,760
什麼 我只能帶二十五個人 到你這兒來嗎 裏根 你是這樣說的
What? Must I come to you with five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?

743
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,760
父親 我可以再說一遍 我只允許您帶這麼幾個人來
And speak it again, my lord. No more with me.

744
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,120
嗯
Ah...

745
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,840
哈
Ha!

746
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,080
我願意跟你去
I'll go with thee.

747
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,280
你的五十個人還比她的二十五個人多上一倍
Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,

748
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,720
你的孝心也比她大一倍
and thou art twice her love.

749
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,200
聽我說 父親
Hear me, my lord.

750
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,600
您需要的二十五個人 十個或者五個
What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five to follow

751
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,920
我們家有兩倍的人讓您差遣和侍候您
in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you?

752
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,200
-僅僅需要一個 -我看一個也不需要
-What need one? -Reason not the need.

753
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,120
最卑賤的乞丐 也有他的不值錢的身外之物
Our basest beggars are in the poorest thing superfluous.

754
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,640
人生除了生理需求之外要是沒有其他的享受 那和畜類的生活有什麼分別
Allow not nature more than nature needs, man's life is cheap as beast's.

755
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,840
你是一位夫人
Thou art a lady.

756
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,480
如果你穿華麗的衣服只為了保暖
If only to go warm were gorgeous,

757
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,920
為什麼 這根本不必穿盛裝
why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,

758
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,560
那不能保暖
which scarcely keeps thee warm.

759
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,080
-但對於真實的需要
-But for true need...

760
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,960
老天 讓我耐心點
You heavens, give me that patience,

761
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,880
我需要耐心
patience I need!

762
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,640
神啊 你們看見我在這兒 一個可憐的老頭子 被憂傷和老邁
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, as full of grief as age,

763
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,040
折磨得好苦
wretched in both.

764
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,120
假如是你們鼓動這兩個女兒的心 使她們忤逆她們的父親
If it could be you that stir these daughters' hearts against their father,

765
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,040
那麼請你們不要儘是愚弄我 叫我默然忍受吧
fool me not so much to bear it tamely.

766
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,480
讓我的心裏激起了剛強的怒火
Touch me with noble anger

767
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,560
別讓婦人所恃為武器的眼淚
and let not women's weapons, water- drops,

768
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,000
玷污我作為男人的尊嚴
stain my man's cheeks.

769
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,560
不 你們這兩個妖女
No, you unnatural hags!

770
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,840
我要向你們復仇 我要做出一些讓全世界都
I will have such revenges on you both that all the world shall...

771
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,360
我將做這樣的事
I will do such things.

772
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,160
我還不知道是什麼事 但這些事情將會是
What they are yet I know not, but they shall be...

773
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,200
將是這世上最恐怖的
the terrors of the earth!

774
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,600
你們以為我會哭泣
You think I'll weep.

775
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,680
不我不會哭
No... I'll not weep!

776
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,480
雖然我有充分的理由哭泣
I have full cause of weeping

777
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,720
可是我寧願讓這顆心碎成萬片
but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws

778
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,440
也不願流下一滴淚來
or ere I'll weep.

779
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,600
啊 傻瓜
O Fool...

780
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,160
我要瘋了
I shall go mad.

781
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,440
暴風雨要來了
'Twill be a storm.

782
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,040
這屋子是容不下父親和他的那幫人的
The old man and his people cannot be well bestowed here.

783
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,280
是他自己不好 放著安逸的日子不過
'Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest,

784
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,520
一定要吃些苦頭 才知道自己的愚蠢
and must needs taste his folly.

785
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,240
單是他一個人 我倒也很願意收留他 其他人不行
For his particular I'll receive him gladly, but not one follower.

786
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,240
我也是這個意思 葛羅斯特伯爵呢
So am I purposed. Where is my Lord of Gloucester?

787
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,880
跟老頭子出去了
Followed the old man forth.

788
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,200
王上正在盛怒之中
The king is in high rage.

789
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,840
-他要到哪去 -我不知道
-Whither is he going? -I know not.

790
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,760
還是不要管他 隨他自己的意思吧
'Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.

791
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,400
伯爵 您千萬不要留他
My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

792
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,520
唉 這妖風刮得真大
Alack, the high winds do sorely ruffle.

793
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,520
田野裏正刮著狂風
Alack, the high winds do sorely ruffle.

794
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,720
幾英里內連灌木叢都沒有
For many miles about there's scarce a bush.

795
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,280
伯爵 對於剛愎自用的人 只好讓他們自己招致的災禍
O sir, to wilful men the injuries that they themselves procure

796
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,400
-來教訓他們 -關上門 伯爵
must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.

797
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,640
關上門 伯爵
Shut up your doors, my lord.

798
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,960
風啊吹吧 撕裂你的臉頰 狂風 吹呀
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!

799
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,480
瀑布一樣的傾盆大雨
Rage, blow, you cataracts and hurricanoes,

800
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,640
傾瀉下來吧 淹沒尖塔和屋頂
spout till you have drenched our steeples, drown'd the cocks!

801
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,120
如思想一般 迅捷的硫磺電火
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,

802
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,440
劈碎橡樹的巨雷先驅
vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts, singe my white head!

803
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,560
震撼一切的雷電啊
And thou, all-shaking thunder,

804
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,320
把這生長繁密的土地擊平吧
strike flat the thick rotundity o'th'world,

805
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,080
打碎造物的模型
crack nature's moulds,

806
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,680
不要留下任何一顆種子 以免生出忘恩負義的人
all germens spill at once that make ingrateful man.

807
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,280
老伯 回去吧
Good nuncle, in!

808
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,040
向你的女兒們祈求原諒吧
Ask thy daughters' blessing.

809
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,640
儘管轟鳴吧 噴發火焰 傾潑雨水
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!

810
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,640
我不責怪你們的無情
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.

811
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,160
隨你們高興 降下可怕的威力來吧
Then let fall your horrible pleasure.

812
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,040
我就站在這 任你們驅使
Here I stand, your slave,

813
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,400
一個可憐 衰弱無力 受人鄙視的老頭子
a poor, infirm, weak and despised old man.

814
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,960
腦袋只要夠靈光 就有屋頂來遮擋
- -He that has a house to put his head in has a good headpiece.

815
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,440
陛下 您在這嗎
-Alas, sir, are you here? -

816
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,640
偉大的神靈在我們頭頂掀起這場可怕的騷動
Let the great gods that keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads

817
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,440
讓他們去找尋他們的敵人吧
find out their enemies now.

818
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,200
我是個並沒有犯下什麼罪 卻受了很大冤屈的人
I am a man more sinned against than sinning.

819
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,040
陛下 這附近有一間茅屋
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel.

820
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,680
有好的主人會借它替你擋擋風雨
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.

821
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,280
我的腦子開始亂了
My wits begin to turn.

822
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,280
過來 我的孩子 你怎麼了 我的孩子
Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy?

823
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,680
你冷嗎 我也冷
Art cold? I am cold myself.

824
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,320
來 帶我到你的茅屋去 可憐的傻小子
Come, your hovel. Poor fool and knave,

825
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,640
我的心中也為你感到悲傷
I have one part in my heart that's sorry yet for thee.

826
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,640
有高清電影網出品 yougaoqing.com

新浪微博@擺渡字幕組譯制

828
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,120
我不贊成這種不近人情的行為
I like not this unnatural dealing.

829
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,080
他們剝奪了我對自己房屋的使用權
They have taken from me the use of mine own house,

830
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,400
不許我提起他的名字 不許我替他說一句情
charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure

831
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,040
也不許我給他任何的救濟 否則就要永遠失去他們的歡心
neither to speak of him, entreat for him or any way sustain him.

832
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,440
-太野蠻 太不近人情了
Most savage and unnatural!

833
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,080
算了
Go to.

834
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,680
你別多說什麼
Say you nothing.

835
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,960
我今晚收到一封信 說出來很危險
I have received a letter this night. 'Tis dangerous to be spoken.

836
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,640
陛下受到這樣的凌虐 總有人會來替他報仇
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged.

837
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,920
有一隻從法國來的軍隊已經在路上了
There is part of a power from France already footed.

838
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,960
我們必須站在國王的一邊 我去找他
We must incline to the king. I will look for him.

839
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,080
你去陪公爵談話 這樣我的暗中救濟便不會被察覺
Go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived.

840
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,360
如果他問起我 就說我感覺不太舒服  已經睡了
If he ask for me, I'm ill and gone to bed.

841
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:34,000
哪怕我會因此而死 雖然他們的確這樣恐嚇過我
If I die for it, as no less is threatened me,

842
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,160
但國王是我的舊主 我不能坐視不理
the king, my old master, must be relieved.

843
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,040
你小心點
Pray you, be careful.

844
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,080
就是這裏 陛下
Here is the place, my lord.

845
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,000
陛下 進去吧
Good my lord, enter.

846
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,680
在毫無遮蔽的夜裏 這樣的暴風雨誰也無法承受
The tyranny of the open night's too rough for nature to endure.

847
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,760
-讓我一個人呆著 -陛下 進去吧
-Let me alone. -Good my lord, enter here.

848
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,560
你自己進去 找一個遮身的地方吧
Prithee, go in thyself, seek thine own ease.

849
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,120
這暴風雨令我無法仔細思考事情
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder on things would hurt me more.

850
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,960
但我待會兒會進去的 進去 孩子 你先走
But I'll go in. In, boy, go first.

851
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,880
我要祈禱 然後我就去睡覺
I'll pray. Then I'll sleep.

852
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,680
衣不蔽體的可憐人
Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,

853
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,400
都得忍受無情暴風雨的襲擊
that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,

854
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,680
你們無瓦遮頭 食不果腹
how shall your houseless heads, your unfed sides,

855
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:46,760
衣不蔽體 如何抵擋這樣的氣候呢
your looped and windowed raggedness defend you from seasons such as these?

856
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,160
我從來沒想過這種事
O, I have ta'en too little care of this.

857
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,400
安享榮華的人啊 睜開眼吧
Take physic, pomp!

858
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,240
到外面體驗一下窮人所受的苦
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel.

859
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,600
救命 救命 救命
Help, help, help me!

860
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,120
有鬼 有鬼
A spirit! A spirit!

861
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,720
什麼
What?

862
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,520
你是什麼人 在這茅屋裏大呼小叫
-What art thou that dost grumble there? -Oh...

863
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,520
出來
-Come forth!

864
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,600
走開
Away!

865
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,800
惡魔就跟在我的背後
The foul fiend follows me!

866
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,480
到你的床上去暖暖身體吧
Go to thy bed and warm thee.

867
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,560
你是也因為把一切都給了兩個女兒才落到這般田地嗎
Didst thou give all to thy daughters and art thou come to this?

868
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,800
他沒有女兒陛下
-He hath no daughters, sir. -Poor Tom!

869
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,000
該死的奸賊
Death, traitor!

870
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,960
除了殘忍的女兒 世上也沒什麼東西能把人的天性馴服到如此卑賤的地步了
Nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters.

871
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,080
上天保佑您過人的才智
Bless thy five wits!

872
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,480
湯姆好冷
Tom's... a-cold.

873
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,120
你本來是做什麼的
What hast thou been?

874
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,520
一個心性高傲的僕人
A servingman, proud in heart and mind,

875
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,480
頭髮卷卷的 帽子上配著情人的手套
who curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap,

876
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,440
會討女人的歡心
served the lust of my mistress's heart

877
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,480
幹些見不得人的勾當
-and did the act of darkness with her...

878
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,320
當著上天的面
...in the sweet face of heaven.

879
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,600
道芬 我的孩子
Dolphin, my boy, boy, sessa!

880
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,800
人不過如此嗎
Is man no more than this?

881
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,440
我們這三個人都已經失掉了本來的面目
Here's three on 's are sophisticated.

882
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,080
只有你才保全著天賦的原形
Thou art the thing itself.

883
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,240
人類在原始時代 不過是像你這樣的一個赤裸 寒磣的
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal

884
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,880
兩腳動物
as thou art. Ha!

885
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,560
脫掉 脫掉這些身外之物
Off, off, you lendings. Come, unbutton here.

886
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,480
老伯 別鬧了
Prithee, nuncle, be contented.

887
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,680
這樣危險的夜裏是不能游泳的
'Tis a naughty night to swim in.

888
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,600
瞧 一團火走來了
Look, here comes a walking fire!

889
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,840
陛下 你怎麼了
How fares your grace?

890
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,840
可憐的湯姆 吃的是泅水的青蛙
Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog...

891
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,280
陛下沒有別的人做伴了嗎
Hath your grace no better company?

892
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,880
地獄裏的魔王是一位紳士 湯姆好冷
The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman! Tom's a-cold...

893
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,640
跟我回去吧
Come with me.

894
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,720
我冒著危險出來找您
I have ventured to come seek you out

895
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,400
來把您帶到有火爐有食物的地方去
and bring you where both fire and food is ready.

896
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,840
讓我先跟這位哲學家說幾句話
First let me talk a word with this philosopher.

897
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,200
陛下
Good my lord...

898
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,960
天上打雷是什麼緣故
What is the cause of thunder?

899
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,760
陛下 接受他的好意 跟他回去吧
Good my lord, take his offer, go to the house!

900
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,240
-陛下 請您 -請您原諒 先生
- I do beseech your grace... -Cry you mercy, sir.

901
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,120
-大哲學家 讓我們來做伴 -湯姆冷著呢
-Come, noble philosopher, your company. -Tom's a-cold.

902
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,240
進去 朋友 到裏面去暖一暖
In, fellow, there. Keep thee warm.

903
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,160
不 這邊走 陛下
No, no, no. This way, my lord.

904
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,920
我要帶上他一起走 我要和我的大哲學家作伴   來吧 雅典人
With him. I will keep company with my philosopher. Come, good Athenian.

905
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,760
請您順從他的意思 讓他把那傢伙也帶進去
O, soothe him, good my lord. Let him take the fellow on.

906
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,960
您帶著他來吧
Take him you on.

907
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,400
來吧先生  雅典人
Come, good sir, good Athenian.

908
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,840
呸 嘿 哼 我聞到了一股不列顛人的血腥
Fee, fie, fo and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.

909
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,840
這就是他談起的那封信
This is the letter which he spoke of,

910
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,880
足以證實他私通法國的罪狀
which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France.

911
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,760
同我去見我的公爵夫人
Come with me to my wife.

912
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,240
這信上所說的 如若屬實
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business at hand.

913
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,880
不管真假 他已經使你成為葛羅斯特伯爵了
True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.

914
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,080
找到你父親
Seek out where thy father is,

915
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,880
that he may be ready for our apprehension.

916
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,840
這裏比露天好一些 將就住吧
Here is better than the open air, take it thankfully.

917
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,600
我會盡我所能 再找點吃的用的
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can.

918
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,840
我去去就來
I will not be long from you.

919
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,560
神明報答您的好心
The gods reward you for your kindness.

920
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,840
老伯 請告訴我 一個瘋子
Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman

921
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,960
是紳士呢還是平民
be a gentleman or a yeoman.

922
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,720
是國王
A king, a king!

923
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,920
是瘋子才相信豺狼的馴良 馬兒的健康
He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's health,

924
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,840
孩子的愛情 或是娼妓的盟誓
a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

925
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,680
這一切該結束了 我必須馬上辦了她們
It shall be done. I will arraign them straight!

926
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,400
來 請坐在這裏 最博學的法官
Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.

927
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,520
來做下吧 賢明的官長 坐下
Sit thou there, sapient sir. Sit!

928
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,720
現在 你們這兩頭母狐貍
And now, you she foxes...

929
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,480
陛下您怎麼了
How do you, sir?

930
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,800
不要這樣呆呆站著
Stand you not so amazed.

931
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,680
你願意躺在褥墊上休息嗎
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

932
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,120
我要先看她們受審
I'll see their trial first.

933
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,560
把她們的證人帶上來
Bring their evidence.

934
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,280
你 穿長袍的法官請入座
Thou robed man of justice, take thy place.

935
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,520
你 他執法的同僚 坐在他的旁邊
And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity, bench by his side.

936
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,160
你是陪審官 也請坐
You are of the commission, sit you, too.

937
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,600
讓他們秉公執法
Let us deal justly.

938
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,280
Mm.

939
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,560
先控訴她
Arraign her first.

940
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,480
這是戈瑞納
'Tis Goneril.

941
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,240
我當著尊嚴的堂上起誓
I here take my oath before this honourable assembly

942
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,960
她曾經趕走她可憐的父王
she kicked the poor king, her father.

943
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,360
過來 夫人 您的名字是戈納瑞嗎
Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

944
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,440
唯有這點她不能否認
She cannot deny it.

945
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,200
對不起 我還以為您是一張折凳
Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint stool.

946
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,320
這邊還有一位 瞧她滿臉的橫肉 就可以知道她的心腸是怎麼樣的
And here's another, whose warped looks proclaim what store her heart is made on.

947
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,360
攔住她
Stop her there.

948
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,000
舉起你們的兵器 拔出你們的劍 點起火把 營私舞弊的法庭
Arms, arms, sword, fire, corruption in the place!

949
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,120
枉法的貪官 為什麼放她逃走
False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

950
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,920
哎 可憐啊 先生
O pity! Sir, whoa...

951
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,200
到哪裏去了
Where...

952
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,160
你那常常誇口自己能保持住的耐心呢
Where's the patience now that you so oft have boasted to retain?

953
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,240
那些小狗
The little dogs and all...

954
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,920
特雷 布蘭切 斯威特哈特 他們都朝我狂叫
Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, they bark at me.

955
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,080
讓湯姆掉過臉來把他們嚇走
Tom will throw his head at them.

956
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,640
滾開 你們這些惡狗
Avaunt, you curs!

957
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,680
叫他們剖開裏甘的屍體
Then let them anatomise Regan,

958
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,360
看看她心裏有些什麼東西
see what breeds about her heart.

959
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,720
上天可有什麼緣故 要造出這樣硬的心腸
Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts?

960
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,520
你 先生 我邀請你做為我一百名侍衛之一
You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred,

961
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,120
只是我不喜歡你服裝的樣式
only I do not like your garments.

962
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,800
你也許想對我說 這是波斯風格 但還是換掉吧
You will say they are Persian, but let them be changed.

963
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,640
現在
Now...

964
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,680
好了 陛下
Good my lord...

965
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,680
請您躺下休息片刻
-Lie here and rest awhile. -

966
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,760
不要吵 不要吵
Make no noise, make no noise.

967
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,080
放下帳子
Draw the curtains.

968
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,680
那麼
So, so...

969
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,600
我們到了早上就吃晚飯
We'll go to supper in the morning.

970
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,160
那我一到中午就去睡覺
And I'll go to bed at noon.

971
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,440
朋友這邊來 陛下在哪裏
Come hither, friend. Where is the king, my master?

972
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,880
這裏 大人 但請不要打擾他 他的神智已經錯亂了
Here, sir, but trouble him not. His wits are gone.

973
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,640
我的好朋友 請你把他抱起來 車已經準備好
Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms. There is a litter ready.

974
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,520
快把他放進去 駕車去多佛
Lay him in it and drive toward Dover, friend,

975
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,440
到了那邊會有人接待和保護你們
where thou wilt meet welcome and protection.

976
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,320
把他抱起來 抱起你的主人來
Take up! Take up thy master.

977
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,240
要是你再耽誤半個鐘頭
If thou shouldst dally half an hour,

978
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,640
他和你的性命 以及一切前來救護他的人的性命 都要保不住了
his life, with thine and all who offer to defend him, stand in assured loss.

979
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,360
快快快 把他抱起來 跟我走
Take up, take up, and follow me.

980
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:50,000
最大的不幸是獨抱牢愁
Who alone suffers suffers most in the mind,

981
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,320
任何的歡愉兜不上心頭
leaving free thoughts and happy shows behind.

982
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,640
現在我的痛苦何等輕鬆
How light and portable my pain seems now,

983
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,000
使我折腰的也使國王鞠了躬
when that which made me bend made the king bow.

984
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,400
他有不孝逆女一如我有殘忍的父親
He childed... as I fathered.

985
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,240
湯姆
Tom...

986
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,520
走吧
Away.

987
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,720
法國軍隊已經登陸 快去搜尋那叛徒葛羅斯特
The army of France is landed. Seek out the traitor Gloucester.

988
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,720
快去找到那個反賊
Go seek the traitor Gloucester!

989
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,000
把他像賊一樣捆起來
Pinion him like a thief.

990
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,320
帶到我們面前
Bring him before us.

991
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,400
捉到之後立刻絞死
Hang him instantly.

992
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,760
把他的眼珠挖出來
Pluck out his eyes.

993
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,360
把他交給我處置
Leave him to my displeasure.

994
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,920
埃德蒙
Edmund...

995
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,920
護送我們的姐姐回去
Keep you our sister company.

996
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,880
我們對你叛變的父親的刑罰
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father

997
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,800
不該讓你看到
are not fit for your beholding.

998
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,880
-再會 親愛的姐姐 -再會 敬愛的公爵
-Farewell, dear sister. -Farewell, sweet lord...

999
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,240
再會 我親愛的妹妹
and sister.

1000
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,880
埃德蒙 再會
Edmund, farewell.

1001
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,520
看看誰來了
Who's there?

1002
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,600
-是那個叛徒嗎   -是那只忘恩負義的老狐貍
-The traitor? -Ingrateful fox, 'tis he.

1003
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,360
把他枯癟的手臂牢牢綁起來
Bind fast his corky arms.

1004
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,000
你們這是什麼意思?
What means your graces?

1005
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,360
我的好朋友們  你們是我的客人
Good my friends, consider. You are my guests.

1006
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,920
不要用這種無禮的手段對我
Do me no foul play, friends.

1007
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
捆住他 再重複一遍
Bind him, I say.

1008
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,320
綁緊些  綁緊些
Hard. Hard!

1009
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,600
-這可惡的反賊  -你是個沒有良心的女人  我不是反賊
-O filthy traitor. -Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none!

1010
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,280
把他綁在這張椅子上  混蛋  我要讓你知道
To the chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find...

1011
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,360
天神在上  這還成什麼話  你扯到我的鬍子了
Ye kind gods! 'Tis most ignobly done to pluck me by the beard.

1012
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,520
鬍子這麼白沒想到卻是一個反賊
So white and such a traitor.

1013
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,800
你從我的下巴上扯下這些鬍子來
These hairs which thou dost ravish

1014
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,240
它們會控訴你的
from my chin will quicken and accuse thee.

1015
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,480
我才是這裏的主人
I'm your host!

1016
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,320
你不應該用你強盜一般的手這樣報答我的好客
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours you should not ruffle thus.

1017
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,280
-你究竟要怎樣?    -得了吧 說吧 先生
-What will you do? -Come, sir.

1018
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,880
你從法國得到了什麼書信?
What letters had you late from France?

1019
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,680
你最好說實話因為我們已經知道了
Be simple-answered for we know the truth.

1020
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,200
你跟那些叛徒有什麼關係
What confederacy with traitors...

1021
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,520
你把發瘋的瘋國王交到誰的手裏了?  說
To whose hands you have sent the lunatic king. Speak.

1022
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,080
我只收到了一封信  裏面都是些猜測
I have a letter guessingly set down,

1023
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,080
寄信的人是中立的
which comes from one that's of a neutral heart,

1024
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,280
並不是一個敵人
and not from one opposed.

1025
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,640
-噢  太狡猾了你  -一派鬼話
-Oh, cunning. -And false.

1026
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,400
你把國王送到什麼地方了?
Where hast thou sent the king?

1027
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
送到了多佛
To Dover.

1028
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,560
為什麼送到多佛?  我們不是警告過你
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril...

1029
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,960
為什麼送到多佛?  讓他回答這個問題
Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.

1030
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,920
我現在身陷窘境只好拚命了
I am tied to the stake and must stand the course.

1031
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,040
為什麼送到多佛?
Wherefore to Dover?

1032
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:45,040
因為我不願意看見你兇惡的指甲挖出他可憐的老眼
Because I would not see thy cruel nails pluck out his poor old eyes,

1033
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,840
也不願意看到你的姐姐用野豬般的牙齒咬他的肉體
nor thy fierce sister in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs!

1034
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,760
但我相信總有一天這些報應會降臨到這些兒女身上的
But I shall see the winged vengeance overtake such children.

1035
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,080
你不會看到那樣的一天的
See't shalt thou never.

1036
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,200
來  按住這椅子
Fellows, hold the chair.

1037
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,840
啊
Oh!

1038
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,640
啊
Oh!

1039
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,000
誰要是希望能夠活到老的過來幫幫我吧
He who will think to live till he be old give me some help!

1040
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,480
噢  好慘
O cruel!

1041
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,080
天哪
O you gods!

1042
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,120
一隻眼會嘲笑另一隻的
One side will mock another.

1043
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,320
另一隻也挖掉吧
The other too.

1044
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,160
如果你能看到什麼報應
If you see vengeance...

1045
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,080
住手  殿下  我從小就效勞您
Hold your hand, my lord. I have served you ever since I was a child,

1046
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,840
但是我現在叫您住手這件事才是最好的效勞
but better service have I never done you than now to bid you hold.

1047
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,040
怎麼  你這狗東西
How now, you dog!

1048
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,040
要是你的腮上長了鬍子  我也要把它扯下來
If you did wear a beard upon your chin I'll shake it on this quarrel.

1049
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,160
你要造反嗎?
What do you mean?

1050
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,240
好  那麼
Nay then...

1051
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,680
那我們拼一下吧
A peasant stand up thus!

1052
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,480
我的大人
My lord...

1053
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,640
你還有一隻眼睛看到他的報應
You have one eye left to see some mischief on him.

1054
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,440
我們把另一隻也挖出來 以免他看到什麼報應
Lest it see more, prevent it.

1055
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,040
出來了  可惡的眼睛
Out, vile jelly...

1056
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,720
你在叫的是一個極其憎恨你的人
Thou callest on him that hates thee.

1057
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,320
仁慈的神明啊 請你寬恕我的過錯
Kind gods, forgive me that

1058
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,200
用福澤庇佑他吧
and prosper him.

1059
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,880
把他攆出去 讓他用他的狗鼻子為自己探路到多佛去吧
Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell his way to Dover.

1060
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,920
啊 裏甘……
Ah, Regan...

1061
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,400
我的血止不住了
I bleed apace.

1062
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,960
這傷受得可真不是時候
Untimely comes this hurt.

1063
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,840
讓我扶著你的手臂吧
Give me your arm.

1064
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:18,080
一個最困苦 最卑賤 最為被命運所羞辱的人
To be worst, the lowest and most dejected thing of fortune

1065
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,760
反而可以時刻抱有希望 無所畏懼
stands still in hope, lives not in fear.

1066
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,480
我沒有什麼時候比現在更不幸了 但我還可能變得更加不幸
I am worse than ever I was. And worse I may be yet.

1067
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,040
你的安慰對我沒有什麼作用 他們也許會害你
Thy comforts can do me no good at all, thee they may hurt.

1068
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,240
我怎麼可以現在離開 您的眼睛都看不見了啊
How now?

1069
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,520
誰在那邊
Who's there?

1070
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,800
那是個可憐的瘋子
It is a poor madman.

1071
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,360
夥計 你要到哪兒去
Fellow, where goest?

1072
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,800
在昨晚的暴風雨中 我也看到過一個像他這樣的傢伙
In the last night's storm I such a fellow saw.

1073
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,840
讓我覺得人不過如螻蟻罷了
Made me think a man a worm.

1074
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,440
我兒子的臉在腦海中浮現 但那時候我正憎恨著他
My son came then into my mind and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him.

1075
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,960
後來我才聽說一些其他的事情
I have heard more since.

1076
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,200
我們於上帝而言就好像調皮小孩兒眼裏的蒼蠅
As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods.

1077
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,520
他就是那個不穿衣服的傢伙嗎
Is that the naked fellow?

1078
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,760
你走吧 幫我那一些衣服替這個可憐人遮蓋一下身體……
Get thee away. Bring some covering for this naked soul...

1079
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,760
天吶 老爺 他可是個瘋子啊
Alack, sir. He is mad.

1080
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,600
瘋子給瞎子帶路 正符合這個扭曲黑暗的時代
'Tis the times' plague when madmen lead the blind.

1081
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,040
最要緊的是 快走吧
Above the rest, begone.

1082
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,120
我會把我最好的衣服拿來 不管它會引起怎樣的後果
I'll bring the best apparel that I have, come of it what will.

1083
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,520
過來小伙子
Come hither, fellow.

1084
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,880
你認識到多佛的路嗎
Dost thou know Dover?

1085
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,440
是的先生
Ay, master.

1086
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,240
那邊有一座懸崖 它那峭拔的絕頂
There is a cliff whose high

1087
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,680
俯瞰著幽深的海水
and bending head looks fearfully in the confined deep.

1088
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,120
把我帶到那懸崖的邊上
Bring me but to the very brim of it.

1089
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,720
到了那我就不需要領路了
From that place I shall no leading need.

1090
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,000
站好了
Stand still!

1091
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,800
把眼睛望到這麼低的地方 真是驚心炫目
How fearful and dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!

1092
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,160
哦 我不能再看了
I'll look no more,

1093
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:35,400
否則要頭暈到栽下去了
lest my brain turn and the deficient sight topple down headlong.

1094
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,960
領我到你站著的地方
Set me where you stand.

1095
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,680
把手給我
Give me your hand.

1096
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,000
哇
Whoa!

1097
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,360
現在您距離懸崖邊只有一尺了
You are now within a foot of the extreme verge.

1098
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:05,120
無論如何 我也不願跳下去
For all beneath the moon, would I not look upright.

1099
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,400
放開我的手
Let go my hand.

1100
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,040
你再走遠一點兒
Go thou farther off.

1101
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,000
向我告別一聲 讓我聽見你走遠了
Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going.

1102
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,600
再會吧 好先生
Now fare ye well, good sir.

1103
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,800
再會
With all my heart.

1104
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,120
威嚴的神明啊
O you mighty gods!

1105
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,880
我現在脫離這一個世界
This world I do renounce.

1106
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,240
要是艾德嘉尚在人間
If Edgar live...

1107
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,920
尚在人間
O bless him!

1108
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,600
現在 朋友
Now, fellow...

1109
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,000
我們再會了
Fare thee well.

1110
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,760
我去了 先生 再會
Gone, sir. Farewell!

1111
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,680
喂 這位先生 朋友
Ho you, sir? Friend?

1112
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,360
你能聽見嗎 先生
Hear you, sir? Speak.

1113
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,520
你是什麼人 先生
What are you, sir?

1114
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,240
走開 讓我死
Away and let me die.

1115
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,040
可是你還在呼吸
But thou dost breathe. Thy life's a miracle.

1116
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,160
在對我說兩句話吧
Speak yet again.

1117
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,240
可是我沒有跌下來
But have I fallen or no?

1118
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,760
他就是從這可怕的懸崖絕頂上面跌下來的
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn. Look up a height.

1119
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,120
-看 -唉 我沒有眼睛
-Do but look up. -Alack, I have no eyes.

1120
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:41,080
難道一個命苦的人 連死的權利都要被剝奪嗎
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit to end itself by death?

1121
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,240
把你的胳膊給我
Give me your arm.

1122
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,960
起來
Up.

1123
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,680
好 怎樣
So, how is it? Feel you your legs?

1124
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,520
你站住了
You stand.

1125
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,320
很穩
Too well... Too well.

1126
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,880
不要胡思亂想 安心忍耐
Bear free and patient thoughts.

1127
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,800
正是他
It is he.

1128
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,960
剛才還有人看見他 瘋狂的像被颶風激動的怒海
He was met even now as mad as the vex'd sea.

1129
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,560
拍一百個士兵 到繁茂的田野裏 各處搜尋
A century send forth, search every acre in the high-grown field

1130
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,760
把我父親領來見我
and bring my father to our eye.

1131
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,160
人的智慧能不能恢復他喪失的心神
What can man's wisdom in the restoring his bereaved sense?

1132
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,640
法子是有的
There is means.

1133
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,880
休息是滋養疲乏精神的保姆
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose.

1134
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,160
快去找他  快去
Seek, seek for him,

1135
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:46,320
我只怕他在補課控制的瘋狂之中 會消滅了他失去主宰的生命
lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it.

1136
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,520
那傢伙彎弓的姿勢 活像一個稻草人
That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper.

1137
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,920
給我射一支一碼長的箭試試看
Draw me a clothier's yard.

1138
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,160
瞧瞧一隻小老鼠
Ha! Look, look, a mouse!

1139
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,640
別鬧 別鬧 這一塊烘乳酪可以抓住它
Peace, peace. This piece of toasted cheese will do't.

1140
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,400
我認識那個聲音
I know that voice.

1141
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,600
啊 飛的好 鳥兒
O, well flown, bird. I'th'clout, i'th'clout. Hewgh!

1142
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,280
啊
Ah.

1143
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,040
口令
Shoo. Give the word.

1144
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,560
-茉蕎蘭 -過去
-Sweet marjoram. -Pass.

1145
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,160
戈納瑞 長著一把白鬍鬚
Goneril with a white beard?

1146
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,520
他們像狗一樣向我獻媚
They flattered me like a dog

1147
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,480
說我在沒有出黑鬚以前 就已經有了白鬚
and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there.

1148
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,640
我說一聲「是」 他們就應一聲「是」
To say "ay" and "no" to every thing I said!

1149
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,680
我說一聲「不」  他們就應一聲「不」
"Ay" and "no" too was no good divinity.

1150
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,840
這聲音我記得很清楚 他不是我們的君王嗎
The trick of that voice I do well remember. Is't not the king?

1151
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,480
對 徹頭徹尾的君王
Ay, every inch a king.

1152
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:55,400
我只要一瞪眼睛 我的臣子就要嚇得發抖
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.

1153
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,840
我赦免那個人的死罪 你犯的是什麼案子 姦淫嗎
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?

1154
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,320
你不用死
Thou shalt not die.

1155
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,640
因姦淫而受死  不
Die for adultery? No...

1156
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,480
讓通姦的人多子多孫吧
Let copulation thrive,

1157
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,240
因為葛羅斯特私生的兒子也比我合法的女兒
for Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father

1158
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,480
更孝順他的父親
than my daughters got 'tween the lawful sheets.

1159
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,880
淫風越盛越好 我巴不得他們替我多製造幾個兵士出來
To it, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers.

1160
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,600
他們的上半身雖然是女人 下半身卻是淫蕩的妖怪
Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above.

1161
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,640
腰帶以上屬於天神 腰帶以下全屬於魔鬼
But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the fiends'.

1162
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,240
那是地獄 那是黑暗 那是火坑
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit,

1163
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:27,440
吐著熊熊的烈焰 發出熏人的惡臭 把一切燒成了灰 啐 啐 呸 呸
burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie! Pah! Pah!

1164
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,800
好掌櫃 給我稱一兩麝香
Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary,

1165
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,280
讓我解解我想像中的臭氣
to sweeten my imagination.

1166
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,600
錢在這兒
There's money for thee.

1167
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,200
讓我吻一吻那隻手
Let me kiss that hand.

1168
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,760
讓我先把它揩乾淨 它上面有一股熱烘烘的人氣
Now, let me wipe it first, it smells of mortality.

1169
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,840
你認識我嗎
Dost thou know me?

1170
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,920
我很記得你這雙眼睛
I remember thine eyes well enough.

1171
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,320
這是一封挑戰書 你拿去讀吧 瞧瞧他是怎麼寫的
Read thou this challenge. Mark but the penning of it.

1172
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,000
即使每一個字都是一個太陽 我也瞧不見
Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.

1173
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,960
-讀呀 -什麼
-Read. -What...

1174
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,600
用眼眶讀嗎
With the case of eyes?

1175
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,880
阿哈 你原來是這個意思嗎
O ho, are you there with me?

1176
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,720
你的頭上也沒有眼睛 你的袋裏也沒有銀錢嗎
No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse?

1177
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,760
你的眼眶真深
Your eyes are in a heavy case,

1178
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,520
可是你卻看見這世界的醜惡
yet you may see how this world goes.

1179
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,600
我只能捉摸到他的醜惡
I see it feelingly.

1180
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,280
什麼
What, art mad?

1181
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,000
一個人就是沒有眼睛 也可以看見這個世界的醜惡
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.

1182
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,760
你還是去裝上一副玻璃眼鏡
Get thee glass eyes

1183
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:27,320
像一個卑鄙的陰謀家似的 假裝能夠看見你所看不見的事情吧
and like a scurvy politician seem to see the things thou dost not.

1184
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,360
來 來 來
Now, now, now...

1185
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,400
要是你願意為我的命運痛哭
If thou wilt weep my cause,

1186
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,960
就把我的眼睛拿了去吧
take my eyes.

1187
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:44,400
我知道你是什麼人 你的名字是葛羅斯特
I know thee well enough. Thy name is Gloucester.

1188
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,560
你必須忍耐
Thou must be patient.

1189
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,440
你知道我們來到這世上
We came crying hither.

1190
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,720
第一次嗅到了空氣
Thou knowest the first time that we smell the air...

1191
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,200
就哇哇的哭起來
we wail and cry.

1192
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,440
讓我講一番道理給你聽 你聽著
I will preach to thee, mark.

1193
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,840
當我們生下來的時候 我們因為來到了
When we are born, we cry

1194
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,680
這個全是傻瓜的廣大舞台之上 所以禁不住放聲大哭
that we are come to this great stage of fools.

1195
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,440
這頂帽子的樣式很不錯
Hey! This is a good block.

1196
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,680
啊 啊
Oy, oy...

1197
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:29,960
用氈呢釘在一隊馬兒的蹄上 倒是一個妙計
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt. Sh!

1198
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,560
我要把它實行一下 悄悄地偷進我那兩個女婿的營裏
I'll put it in proof, and when I have stolen upon these son-in-laws,

1199
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,080
然後我就殺呀 殺呀 殺呀
then kill, kill, kill,

1200
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,720
他在這兒 抓住他
-kill, kill, kill... -Hey! There he is. Lay hand upon him!

1201
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,000
殺呀 殺呀 殺呀
Kill, kill, kill!

1202
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,560
我是一個國王 你們知道嗎
I'm a king, masters, know you that?

1203
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:58,400
您是尊貴的陛下 我們服從您的旨意
-You are a royal one and we obey you. - Then there's life in it.

1204
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,560
要去快去
Come, and you get it, you shall get it by running.

1205
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,640
你的主人呢
Where's your master?

1206
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,600
夫人 他在裏邊 可與之前判若兩人
Madam, aloft, but never man so changed.

1207
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,840
我告訴他法國軍隊登陸的消息 他聽了只是微笑
I told him the French were landed. He laughed at it.

1208
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,680
我告訴他 葛羅斯特謀反的時候
And of Gloucester's treachery when I informed him he called me sot,

1209
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,760
說我顛倒是非
and told me I'd turned the wrong way out.

1210
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,240
埃德蒙 你且回到軍隊去
Back, Edmund, to the troops.

1211
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,440
催促他趕緊調集人馬 交給你統帥
Hasten your musters and conduct your powers.

1212
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,440
這個可靠的僕人可以替我們傳達消息
This trusty servant shall pass between us.

1213
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,760
不久你就會聽到你女主人的命令
Ere long you are like to hear a mistress's command.

1214
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,760
把東西帶在身邊
Wear this.

1215
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,400
不要多說什麼
Spare speech.

1216
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,920
低下你的頭來
Decline your head.

1217
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:58,000
這一個吻 要是能夠替我說話
This kiss, if it durst speak,

1218
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,240
它會叫你的靈魂飛上天空
would stretch thy spirits up into the air.

1219
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,520
你要明白我的心
Conceive...

1220
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,440
再會吧
and fare thee well.

1221
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,600
我願意為你赴湯蹈火
Yours... in the ranks of death.

1222
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,320
我最親愛的葛羅斯特
My most dear Gloucester.

1223
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,520
唉
Oh...

1224
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:39,080
都是男人 卻有天壤之別
The difference... of man and man.

1225
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,880
哪一個女人不願意為你貢獻她的一切
To thee a woman's services are due.

1226
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,360
我卻讓一個傻瓜侵佔了我的眠床
A fool usurps my bed.

1227
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,440
夫人 殿下來了
Madam, here comes my lord.

1228
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,240
你太瞧不起人了
I have been worth the whistle.

1229
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,240
啊 戈納瑞
O Goneril...

1230
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,840
你的價值還比不上那狂風吹在你臉上的塵土
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face.

1231
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,920
得了得了  全是些傻話
No more. The text is foolish.

1232
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,240
智慧和仁義在惡人眼中看來都是惡的
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile, filths savour but themselves.

1233
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:13,440
不中用的懦夫 你的鼓呢
Milk-livered man, where's thy drum?

1234
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,480
法國的國旗已經展開在我們寧靜的國境上了
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,

1235
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,280
你這迂腐的傻子卻坐著一動不動  只會說「唉 他為什麼要這樣呢」
whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries, "Alack, why does he so?"

1236
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,960
瞧瞧你自己吧 魔鬼
See thyself, devil!

1237
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,800
惡魔的醜惡嘴臉 還不及一個惡魔般的女人那樣醜惡萬分
Proper deformity shows not in the fiend so horrid as in woman.

1238
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:39,280
你這沒有頭腦的
Vain... fool.

1239
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,840
我對姐妹兩人都已經立下了愛情的盟誓
To both these sisters have I sworn my love,

1240
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,280
他們彼此互懷嫉妒 就像一朝被蛇咬便見不得蛇的蹤影
each jealous of the other as the stung are of the adder.

1241
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,200
我應該選擇哪一個呢
Which of them shall I take?

1242
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,760
兩個都要
Both? One?

1243
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,480
還是一個也不要
Or neither?

1244
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,280
要是兩個全都留在世上 我就一個也不能到手
Neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive.

1245
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,440
現在請你告訴我
Tell me but truly,

1246
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,080
老老實實的告訴我
but then speak the truth.

1247
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,240
你不愛我的姐姐嗎
Do you not love my sister?

1248
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,480
我只是按照我的名分敬愛她
In honoured love.

1249
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:22,280
可是你從來沒有深入我姐夫的禁地嗎
But have you never found my brother's way to the forfended place?

1250
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,320
您有這種想法可有失體統
That thought abuses you.

1251
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,720
憑著我的名譽起誓 夫人 沒有這樣的事
No, by mine honour, madam.

1252
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,480
我絕不答應她
I never shall endure her.

1253
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,720
我親愛的爵爺
Dear my lord...

1254
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,320
不要跟她親熱
Be not familiar with her.

1255
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,800
您放心吧
Fear me not.

1256
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,240
她跟她的公爵丈夫來了
She and the duke, her husband.

1257
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,160
賢妹久違了
Our very loving sister, well be-met.

1258
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,440
伯爵 我聽說
Sir, this I heard. The king is come to his daughter,

1259
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,800
高呼不平的人們到他女兒的地方去了
with others whom the rigour of our state forced to cry out.

1260
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,240
法國舉兵侵犯我們的領土 我們不能容忍
It touches us, as France invades our land.

1261
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,600
您說的有理
Sir, you speak nobly.

1262
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,720
-這段話講他做什麼呢 -我們只需同心合力打退敵人
-Why is this reasoned? -Combine together 'gainst the enemy,

1263
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,320
這些內部的糾紛 不是現在所要討論的問題
for these domestic and particular broils are not the question here.

1264
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,040
那我們討論討論應該採取的戰略吧
Let's then determine on our proceeding.

1265
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,960
-姐姐 你也跟我們一塊兒去嗎 -不
-Sister, you'll go with us? -No.

1266
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,920
你怎麼可以不去 來 請吧
'Tis most convenient. Pray, go with us.

1267
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,920
哼 我明白你的意思
Oh, I know the riddle.

1268
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,280
好 我去
I will go.

1269
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,680
好肯特啊
O thou good Kent.

1270
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,640
我怎麼才能報答你這份良苦用心呢
How can I live and work to match thy goodness?

1271
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:41,000
就是粉身碎骨 也不能抵償你的大德
My life will be too short and every measure fail me.

1272
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,600
夫人 只要自己的苦心被人瞭解 那就是莫大的報酬了
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.

1273
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,720
我所講的話 句句屬實 沒有一分增減
All my reports go with the modest truth, nor more, nor clipped, but so.

1274
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,440
我親愛的父親
O my dear father...

1275
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,520
但願我的嘴唇上
Restoration hang thy medicine on my lips

1276
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,320
有治癒瘋狂的靈藥 讓這一吻抹去了
and let this kiss repair those violent harms

1277
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,040
我那兩個姐姐加在你身上的無情的傷害吧
that my two sisters have in thy reverence made.

1278
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,440
他醒來了
He wakes.

1279
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,400
對他說些什麼吧
Speak to him.

1280
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,720
夫人 應該您跟他說
Madam, do you. 'Tis fittest.

1281
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,600
父王陛下
How does my royal lord?

1282
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,240
您好嗎
How fares your majesty?

1283
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,480
你們不應該
You do me wrong...

1284
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,360
把我從墳墓中間拖了出來
to take me out of the grave.

1285
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:02,280
你是一個有福的靈魂 我卻縛在
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound upon a wheel of fire

1286
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:06,520
一個烈火的車輪上 我自己的眼淚
that mine own tears do scald like molten lead.

1287
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,160
父親 你認識我嗎
Sir, do you know me?

1288
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,800
你是一個靈魂 我知道
You are a spirit, I know.

1289
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,600
你什麼時候死的
Where did you die?

1290
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,920
還是瘋瘋癲癲的
Still far, far wide.

1291
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,000
他還沒有完全清醒過來
He's scarce awake.

1292
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,400
暫時不要驚擾它
Let him alone awhile.

1293
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,440
我到過些什麼地方  現在我在什麼地方
Where have I been? Where am I?

1294
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,560
明亮的白晝嗎
Fair daylight?

1295
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,240
我上了大當了
I am mightily abused.

1296
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,760
我如果看見別人落到這一個地步 也要為他心碎而死
I should even die with pity to see another thus.

1297
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,720
我不知道應該怎麼說啊
I know not what to say.

1298
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,920
我不願發誓 這一雙是我的手
I will not swear these are my hands.

1299
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,800
讓我試試看
Let's see.

1300
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,560
這針刺上去是疼的
I feel this pin prick.

1301
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,600
但願我能知道我現在的狀況
Would I were assured of my condition.

1302
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,800
看著我 父親
O look upon me, sir,

1303
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,440
把您的手按在我的頭上為我祝福
and hold your hand in benediction o'er me.

1304
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,520
啊......
Ah...

1305
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,720
您不要跪
You must not kneel.

1306
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,480
請不要取笑我
Pray do not mock me.

1307
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,360
我真是個愚蠢的傻老頭
I am a very foolish fond old man,

1308
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,280
都活了八十多歲了
fourscore and upward, not an hour more, nor less.

1309
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:46,600
說實話 我怕是腦子不大好
And, to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

1310
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,720
我想我應該認識您 也認識這個人
Methinks I should know you and know this man.

1311
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,440
可我不敢確定
Yet I am doubtful.

1312
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,800
因為我不知道這是哪兒
For I am mainly ignorant what place this is

1313
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,000
憑著我的能力也不知道什麼時候穿的這身衣服
and all the skill I have remembers not these garments,

1314
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,960
我也不知道昨晚在哪兒住的
nor I know not where I did lodge last night.

1315
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,720
不要嘲笑我
Do not laugh at me,

1316
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,800
因為 我也是個人
for, as I am a man,

1317
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,920
我想這位夫人是我的孩子......
I think this lady to be my child...

1318
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,120
考狄利婭
Cordelia.

1319
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,360
我是......
And so I am...

1320
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,800
我是
I am.

1321
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,720
怎麼哭了
Be your tears wet?

1322
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,000
不要哭了
I pray thee... weep not.

1323
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,640
就算你把毒藥給我 我也會喝下去
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.

1324
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,320
我知道你不愛我
I know you do not love me,

1325
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,600
你的兩個姐姐都虐待我
for your sisters have, as I do remember, done me wrong.

1326
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,680
你虐待我還有理由 而他們沒有
You have some cause, they have not.

1327
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,360
誰都沒有理由
No cause, no cause.

1328
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,040
我在法國麼
Am I in France?

1329
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,680
-在您自己的國境內 陛下 -不要騙我
- In your own kingdom, sir. - Do not abuse me.

1330
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,400
請寬心一點 夫人
Be comforted, good madam.

1331
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,280
您看他已經平靜下來了
The great rage, you see, is killed in him.

1332
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,400
不要再多加煩擾他
Desire him to go in.

1333
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,480
請陛下到裏面去休息休息吧
Will it please your highness walk?

1334
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,200
啊......你必須原諒我
Ah... You must bear with me.

1335
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,120
請你既往不咎 寬恕我的罪過
Pray you now, forget and forgive.

1336
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,840
我老了......
I am old...

1337
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,480
還糊塗
and foolish.

1338
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,520
開火
Fire!

1339
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,040
開火
Fire!

1340
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,600
掩護
Take cover!

1341
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,160
等我回來 就安全了
If ever I return to you again, I'll bring you comfort.

1342
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,120
願你平安 先生
Grace go with you, sir.

1343
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,640
先仔細檢查一遍這片區域
On le recherche sur toute cette zone.

1344
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,040
之後如果你願意的話
Apres nous pourrons deployer si vous voulez

1345
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,000
我們可以在宮殿旁再布些人手
une autre troupe du c?te du chateau...

1346
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,080
快離開那兒
Away!

1347
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,760
老先生
Old man!

1348
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,280
給我你的手 快離開那兒
Give me thy hand, away!

1349
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,800
李爾王敗了 他和他的女兒都被捉走了
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter taken.

1350
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,880
給我你的手 快走
Give me thy hand. Come on!

1351
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,920
不了 先生
No further, sir.

1352
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,080
我就在這等死吧
A man may rot even here.

1353
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:08,120
您應該耐心忍受上天的安排
Men must endure their going hence even as their coming hither.

1354
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,040
一切都是殘忍的
Ripeness is all.

1355
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,480
哦......哦......
Oh... Oh...

1356
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,560
哦......
Oh...

1357
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,320
右 左
Right, left.

1358
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:57,840
我們不是第一個好心辦壞事的人
We are not the first who with best meaning have incurred the worst!

1359
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,920
我們不能見見女兒和姐姐麼
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

1360
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,200
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

1361
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,760
過來 我們去監獄吧
Come, let's away to prison.

1362
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,240
哈......
Ha...

1363
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,520
我們倆會像籠中鳥一樣歌唱
We two alone will sing like birds in the cage.

1364
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,280
如果你需要我的祝福
When thou dost ask me blessing,

1365
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,160
我會下跪乞求你的寬恕
I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness.

1366
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:21,640
我們會活著並祈禱 歌唱 講故事
And so we'll live, and pray, and sing, and tell old tales,

1367
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,040
我們會笑蝴蝶鍍金
and laugh at gilded butterflies.

1368
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,880
聽可憐蟲閒話宮廷軼事 我們也會同他們交談
And hear poor rogues talk of court news and we'll talk with them too,

1369
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,840
誰失 誰得 誰掌權 誰垮台
who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out...

1370
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,800
我們能參透事態的秘密
and take upon us the mystery of things

1371
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,800
我們是上帝派來的密探
as if we were God's spies.

1372
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:50,920
我們會在這銅牆鐵壁中冷眼旁觀你們這群大人物
And we'll wear out in a walled prison packs and sects of great ones

1373
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,040
隨月圓月缺而浮沉
that ebb and flow by the moon.

1374
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:02,320
對於這樣的祭物 我的考狄利婭
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,

1375
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:10,680
天神也會焚香致敬
the gods themselves throw incense.

1376
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,080
哈 我果然捉到你了麼
Hm! Have I caught thee?

1377
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:19,200
他要是想分開我們 必須從天上取來火把
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,

1378
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,440
像驅逐狐貍那樣焚燒我們
and fire us hence like foxes.

1379
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,760
擦乾眼淚
Wipe thine eyes.

1380
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,600
讓惡瘡吞噬掉他們的血肉
The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell

1381
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,280
他們不能使我們落淚
ere they shall make us weep.

1382
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,600
我們要先看著他們活活餓死
We'll see 'em starved first.

1383
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,120
來
Come.

1384
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,240
我把你提了一級
One step I have advanced thee.

1385
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:01,440
要是你按照這張密令上的話去做 一定大有好處
If thou dost as this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way to noble fortunes.

1386
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:18,360
願意就做 不願意就另謀出路吧
Either say thou'lt do it or thrive by other means.

1387
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,880
我不會拖車子 也不會吃干麥
I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats.

1388
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,040
只要是男子漢做的事 我都會去做
If it be man's work, I'll do it.

1389
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:36,040
伯爵 您今天果然表明了您是一個將門之子 命運眷顧著您
Sir, you have showed today your valiant strain, and fortune led you well.

1390
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,800
您的功勞重大 跟我們敵對的人都已束手就擒
You have the captives who were the opposites of this day's strife.

1391
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,320
請您把俘虜交給我們
I do require them of you

1392
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,800
我們會顧及到他們的身份和我們自身的安全而妥善安置他們
so that we shall find their merits and our safety may equally determine.

1393
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:49,400
殿下 我已經把那個不幸的老國王拘禁起來了
Sir, I thought it fit to send the old and miserable king to some retention.

1394
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,280
現在我們流血流汗
At this time we sweat and bleed.

1395
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,000
折損了不少親人朋友
The friend hath lost his friend,

1396
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,960
他們不免心中激憤
and the best quarrels in the heat

1397
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,560
見證過戰爭殘酷的人們怨恨這場戰爭
are cursed by those that feel their sharpness.

1398
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:03,120
對於考狄利婭和他父親的審判應該選擇一個更合適的時機
The question of Cordelia and her father requires a fitter place.

1399
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:07,280
伯爵 說句不好聽的 你只是個隨征將領 並不是我的兄弟
Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war, not as a brother.

1400
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,280
他帶領我們的軍隊 受到我的全權委託
He led our powers, bore the commission of my place and person,

1401
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:15,200
就憑這層親密的關係 就足夠與你稱兄道弟了
the which immediacy may well stand up and call itself your brother.

1402
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,280
你可少親熱點
Not so hot.

1403
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:20,480
他是靠著自己才能又不是靠著你的恩惠
In his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition.

1404
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:25,600
我把我的權利賦予他 他就能和最尊貴的人匹敵
In my rights by me invested, he compeers the best.

1405
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,760
要是他是你丈夫 最多也不過如此吧
That were the most if he should husband you.

1406
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,760
笑話往往會變成預言
Jesters do oft prove prophets.

1407
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,720
呵呵 看你擠眉弄眼的果然不大對勁
Uh-uh. That eye that told you so looked but asquint.

1408
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,240
姐姐 我不舒服
Lady, I am not well,

1409
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:40,600
懶得跟你吵
else I should answer from a full-flowing stomach.

1410
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,400
將軍......
General...

1411
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:51,640
請接受我的軍隊 俘虜 和財產
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony.

1412
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,880
包括我 都隨你支配 這座城都是你的
Dispose of them, of me. These walls are thine.

1413
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:00,320
讓全世界為我證明 我要把你立為我的丈夫和君主
Witness the world that I create thee here my lord and master.

1414
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,920
那不是你能阻止的
The let-alone lies not in your good will.

1415
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,680
這與你無關
Nor in thine, lord.

1416
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,520
雜種 跟我有關
Half-blooded fellow, yes.

1417
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,440
證明下我把尊位讓給了你
Prove my title thine.

1418
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:12,600
埃德蒙 我有權以叛國罪和剝奪財產罪逮捕你
Edmund, I arrest thee on capital treason, and in thy attaint this gilded serpent.

1419
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,120
這個插曲可真有意思
An interlude.

1420
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,640
公開發出挑戰
Let the challenge sound.

1421
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,160
要是沒有人出來指證 你所犯的無數兇殘罪惡
If none appear to prove upon thy person thy heinous, manifest and many treasons,

1422
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,640
-我以命相爭
here is my pledge. I'll make it on my heart.

1423
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,120
-我也願賭上性命
There's my exchange.

1424
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:26,240
誰罵我是叛徒
What in the world he is that names me traitor,

1425
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,720
他就是一個說謊的惡人
villain-like he lies.

1426
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:34,040
誰有膽量出來 我可以向他 向你 向每一個人
He that dares approach, on him, on you, who not?

1427
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:36,840
證明我的不可動搖的忠心和榮譽
I will maintain my truth and honour firmly.

1428
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,720
那就發出挑戰吧
-Let the challenge sound.

1429
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,840
哎喲 我感覺很不舒服
My sickness grows upon me.

1430
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,280
她病了 把她扶到房間休息
She is not well, convey her to my room.

1431
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:01,160
在本軍之中 如有身份高貴的將校官佐
If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army

1432
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:05,760
願意證明埃德蒙 未定名份的葛羅斯特伯爵
will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,

1433
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,360
是一個罪惡多端的叛徒
that he is a manifold traitor,

1434
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,720
站出來
let him appear!

1435
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,800
誰指使你來的
What sayest thou?

1436
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,840
我宣佈你是一個叛徒
Thou art a traitor,

1437
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,440
你背叛了眾神 背叛了你的哥哥和父親
false to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father.

1438
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,240
我要把這些罪名丟回到你頭上
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head.

1439
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:50,080
來吧
Yeah! Come on!

1440
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,520
加油
-Fight! -

1441
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,280
起來 起來
-Get up! -Get up.

1442
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,520
你不是被人打敗 你是中計了
Thou art not vanquished but cozened and beguiled!

1443
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,280
閉嘴 你個婦人
Shut your mouth, dame!

1444
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,760
不
No!

1445
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,280
帶她走 她絕望了
Go with her. She's desperate.

1446
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:17,400
你指控我的罪狀
What you have charged me with, that have I done.

1447
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,760
而且 不止這些罪孽
And more, much more.

1448
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,400
可你是誰
But what art thou?

1449
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,960
在血統上 我並不比你低微 埃德蒙
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.

1450
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,040
我是埃德加
My name is Edgar...

1451
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,120
你父親的兒子
and thy father's son.

1452
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,440
天道的車輪已經循環過來了
The wheel is come full circle.

1453
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,040
我回來了
I am here.

1454
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,960
我的心要爆裂了
O that my heart would burst...

1455
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,960
救命 救命
Help! Help!

1456
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,680
說吧  什麼事
Well, speak, man.

1457
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,280
這把刀
This knife...

1458
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,560
這把刀是從心上拔下來的
This knife came even from the heart of...

1459
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,400
誰的心 快說
Well, who, man? Speak!

1460
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,040
你夫人
Your lady, sir.

1461
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:01,400
你的夫人 把她的妹妹也給毒死了
Your lady. And her sister by her is poisoned.

1462
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,120
她承認了
She confesses it.

1463
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,000
屍體抬出來
Produce the bodies.

1464
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,480
不管是死是活
Be they alive or dead.

1465
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:09,880
快去
Go on.

1466
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:12,680
我跟她們兩人都有婚姻之約
I was contracted to them both.

1467
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,640
現在我們三個人可以一起做夫妻了
All three now marry in an instant.

1468
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:28,040
我要來上我的國王道一聲永久的晚安
I am come to bid my king and master aye good night.

1469
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,160
他不在這兒嗎
Is he not here?

1470
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,960
你見過這種場景嗎 肯特
Seest thou this object, Kent?

1471
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,720
我快要斷氣了
I pant for life.

1472
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,920
快差人阻止
Quickly send...

1473
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:53,360
我下令要處死李爾和科迪莉亞
for my writ is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.

1474
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,480
快去阻止
Send in time!

1475
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,520
-差一點就來不及了 -把他抬下去
-Haste thee for thy life! -Bear him hence!

1476
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,680
哀號吧
Howl!

1477
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,120
哀號吧
Howl!

1478
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,120
哀號吧
Howl!

1479
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,840
哀號吧
Howl!

1480
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:30,800
你們這些石頭一樣的人
O you are men of stones.

1481
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:37,720
要是我有了你們的那些舌頭和眼睛 我要用我的眼淚和哭聲震撼蒼穹
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so that heaven's vault should crack.

1482
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,600
她已經去世了
She's gone... for ever.

1483
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:30,080
一個人死了還是活著 我是知道的
I know when one is dead and when one lives.

1484
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,680
她已經向泥土一樣死去
She's dead as earth.

1485
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,040
這根羽毛在動
This feather stirs.

1486
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,200
她就還活著
She lives.

1487
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,760
要是她還有命活
If it be so, it is a chance

1488
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:53,200
那我的一切悲哀 都可以消逝了
which does redeem all sorrows that ever I have felt.

1489
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,560
-我的好主人
O my good master...

1490
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,240
走開
Prithee, away.

1491
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:00,520
這是尊貴的肯特 您的朋友
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

1492
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:05,080
一場瘟疫降落在你們身上 你們全是兇手 奸賊
A plague upon us, murderers, traitors all!

1493
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,600
我本可以把她救活的
I might have saved her.

1494
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,560
而她再也
Now she's gone...

1495
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,080
回不來了
for ever.

1496
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,600
科迪莉亞
Cordelia...

1497
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:22,240
科迪莉亞 等一等
Cordelia, stay a little. Ha?

1498
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,520
你說什麼
What is't thou sayest?

1499
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,360
她的聲音總是那麼柔軟溫和
Her voice was ever soft, gentle and low.

1500
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,440
女兒家是應該這樣的
An excellent thing in woman.

1501
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,920
我親手殺死了把你縊死的奴才
I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.

1502
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,160
我不是把他殺死了嗎
Did I not, fellow?

1503
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,400
是的 大人
'Tis true, my lords, he did.

1504
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:56,640
從前 我一舉起我的寶刀 就可以把他們嚇得抱頭鼠竄
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion I'd have made 'em skip!

1505
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,800
現在我老了
I'm old now,

1506
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,120
收到這許多磨難
and these same crosses spoil me.

1507
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,800
一天不如一天
This is a dull sight.

1508
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,320
你是誰
Who are you?

1509
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:23,240
我跟你說 我的眼睛可不太好
Mine eyes are not of the best, I'll tell you straight.

1510
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,080
你是肯特嗎
Are you not Kent?

1511
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,080
陛下 正是您的僕人 肯特
The same, your servant Kent.

1512
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:31,040
你的隨從卡厄斯呢
Where is your servant, Caius?

1513
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:34,200
我可以告訴你 他是一個好人
He's a good man, I'll tell you that.

1514
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:37,680
他一動起火來就打人 -他已經死的骨頭都腐爛了
He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.

1515
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,520
不 陛下
No, my good lord!

1516
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,760
-我就是那個人 -我馬上就能認出來你不是
-I am the very man... -I'll see that straight.

1517
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:46,040
那個從您開始遭遇變故以來 就一直跟隨著您的人
...that from your first of difference and decay have followed your sad steps.

1518
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:47,360
歡迎 歡迎
You are welcome hither.

1519
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:52,000
他不知道自己在說什麼 我們謁見他也是徒勞的
He knows not what he says and vain is it that we present us to him.

1520
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,560
大人 尊貴的朋友 聽我說
My lords and noble friends, know our intent.

1521
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,840
我們要盡量給他可能的安慰
What comfort to this great decay may come shall be applied.

1522
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,120
當他在世的時候 我仍舊
For us, we will resign

1523
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,960
把最高的權利歸還給他
during the life of this old majesty to him our absolute power.

1524
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,520
哦 快看啊
O see, see!

1525
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:13,400
還有 我可憐的傻女兒也縊死了
And... and my poor fool... is hanged.

1526
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,040
不 不
No... No...

1527
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:21,040
沒有命了
No life.

1528
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:29,080
為什麼一條狗 一匹馬 一隻耗子都有生命
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life...

1529
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,520
你卻沒有一絲呼吸
and thou no breath at all?

1530
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,200
你是永遠回不來了
Thou'lt come no more.

1531
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,040
永不
Never...

1532
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:47,880
永不
Never...

1533
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,800
永不 永不 永不
Never, never, never...

1534
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,520
請你替我解開這個紐扣
Pray you, undo this button.

1535
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,400
謝謝你先生
Thank you, sir.

1536
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,720
瞧瞧
See this?

1537
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,760
瞧瞧她
Look...

1538
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,280
她的嘴唇
On her, her lips.

1539
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,520
看那兒 看那兒
Look there, look there.

1540
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,880
他暈過去了
- -He faints.

1541
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:23,760
陛下
My lord...

1542
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,680
陛下
My lord?

1543
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:30,960
碎吧 心啊 碎吧
Oh. Break, heart, I prithee break.

1544
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:34,480
抬起頭來 陛下
Look up, my lord.

1545
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,440
不要煩擾他的靈魂 啊 讓他安然死去吧
O, vex not his ghost. O, let him pass.

1546
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,760
他將要痛恨那些想要使他在這無情世上
He hates him that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out longer.

1547
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,960
他真的去了
He is gone indeed.

1548
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:09,240
他居然忍受了這麼久的時候
The wonder is he hath endured so long.

1549
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:14,240
他的生命不是他自己的
He but usurped his life.

1550
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,760
兩位朋友
Friends of my soul,

1551
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:38,560
請幫我主持大政重振國本
you twain rule in this realm and the gor'd state sustain.

1552
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:42,480
不日間我將登程上道
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.

1553
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:47,080
我聽到了主上的召喚 使命所在
My master calls me. I must not say no.

1554
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,040
不幸的重擔不能不肩負
The weight of this sad time we must obey,

1555
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,440
感情是我們唯一的語言
speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.

1556
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:26,320
年老的人已經忍受了一切
The oldest hath borne most.

1557
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:31,640
後人只有 撫陳跡
We that are young shall never see so much,

1558
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,280
而嘆息
nor live so long.

1559
