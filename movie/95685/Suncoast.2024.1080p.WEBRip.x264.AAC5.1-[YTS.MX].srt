[girl 2] <i>I'm so excited to go to school.
I'm sad to leave this, though.</i>

[girl 1] <i>Boys, boys, boys, boys...
Brand new boys.</i>

[girl 2] <i>You'll probably find
some pretty boys in Santa Barbara.</i>

8
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,083
<i>Yeah, I think I'm going to be on
the lookout for hot water polo players.</i>

9
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,167
[girl 2] <i>Nice.</i>

<i>I'm going to get something to drink.</i>

11

Oh, God, I can't stand
looking at that poor woman.

20
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,708

[tv show host] <i>Let's give it up

26
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,833
- Well, did you give him his shot?
- Yes, I did.

27
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,500
Did you vacuum?

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,208
- Yeah.
- Doesn't look like it.

29
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,292
'Cause the carpet's a thousand years old.

30
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,708
God, this place really has
turned into a shit hole.

31
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,125
I'm going to need your help
with him in the morning.

32
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,708
I can't. I'll miss the van.

33
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,208
Oh, Doris, it's a big day.
You don't have to go to school.

34
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,583
[Doris] But I want to go.

35
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,250
- You'll be late and I'll write you a note.
- No, please, Mom.

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll have to interrupt class
and everyone looks at me...

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,083
It's really embarrassing.

38
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,833
Oh it's really embarrassing. Oh, well...

39
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,500
Oh, well, then I guess I'll just have to
drop your brother off by myself,

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
because God forbid,
you should be embarrassed.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,458
Okay, fine. I'll come. Forget it.

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,167
No? Oh, are you sure?

43
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:46,125
You sure? Because I wouldn't want you
to blush in front of your friends.

44
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,125
I don't have any friends.
And fine, I said forget it.

47
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,083
[Mom] Oh, my God. Okay.

48
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,125
- [Mom] Lift him up.
- [Doris] I'm trying.

49
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,375
Come on.

[vehicle brakes]

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm taking her today.

52
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,250
You can go.

53
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:21,792
[Mom] What is he? Deaf?

54
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,875
Mom, stop yelling.
He obviously can't hear you.

55
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,958
Okay.

56
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,167
Hello?

57
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,625
I'm taking her. You can go!

58
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,625
- Drive away!
- Mom, stop yelling.

59
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,292
Everyone is staring at us.

60
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,458
[Mom] Okay, lift his upper body.
Up, here we go.

61
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,417
There we go. That's good.

62
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,708
All right, sweetheart. Sorry.

63
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,042
I'm so sorry.

64
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,417
Can I drive?

65
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,292
[Mom] What? No, no, no, no.
We don't have time.

66
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,375
- Come on, you never let me--
- Doris!

67
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,458
Please, not today.

68
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,833
Okay.

69
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,250
All right.

70
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,875
[Mom] [stammering] Get in the back!

71
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,042
- What?
- The latch has been screwy.

72
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:08,792
You got to make sure
his chair doesn't fall out.

73
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,250
My hair is gonna go nuts.

74
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,083
Your hair?

75
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,333
[Mom] Goddamn piece of crap.

76
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,208
For fuck's sake.

77
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,833

[crowd chattering]

81
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:55,208
Excuse me. If you don't mind
I just need to check your bags.

82
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,542
Why?

83
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,708
[security guard] Unfortunately,
the staff gets a lot of threats

84
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,792
since Mrs. Schiavo got here.

85
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,542
[Mom] So you think while I'm dropping
my son off, I'm going to kill someone?

86
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,333
[Doris] Just let her check your bags.

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,292
Hi, there. Is everything okay?
I'm Mia, the Director of Nursing.

88
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,833
- You're the Director? How old are you?
- Mom!

89
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,792
- It's okay.
- What? It's just a question.

90
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,750
How old are you?
'Cause you do. You look young.

91
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,542
[Mia] I actually get that a lot.

92
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't worry about your bags.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,083
If you both want to follow me,
I can check you in.

94
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,833
This way.

95
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,292
[crowd shouting outside]

96
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,667
[light scrubbing]

97
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,417
[Mom] I can't believe that teenager
just shoved us in here.

98
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:46,000
Look at this. Look!

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,542
Look at this.

100
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:51,125
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'm going to clean this place up.

101
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,333
This room is way cleaner than our house.

102
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,208
I don't know if this...

103
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,667
Do you think this is
the right place for him?

104
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,333
I just-- I'm not so sure.

105
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,500
You'd say that about any place.

106
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,875
Are you not at all upset about this?

107
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,500
This is it, Doris.

108
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,125
This filthy box is where
your brother's going to die.

109
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,792
Of course I'm upset.

110
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,833
Can we go soon? I'm already really late.

111
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:20,583
You know, you could just try and think
about someone other than yourself.

112
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,042
You might like it.

113
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,583
Brad and Jen just broke up.

114
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,833
Right now I'm thinking about them.

115
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,458
Oh, they did?

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I knew they would.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,875
The second they got married.
What did I say?

118
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,375
- He's too handsome.
-"He's too handsome."

119
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,542
The handsome ones never stay.

120
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:40,542
Like your brother.

121
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,667
Too handsome for this world.

122
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,333
Can we go now, please?

123
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,958
[gentle music plays]

124
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,333
Welcome back, Doris. Thank you.

125
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,333
[student 1] Dude, she said it was a
one-time thing, like, I don't know.

126
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,625
Oh, my gosh.

127
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,208
You seriously think
Cody's hooking up with Tiffany?

128
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,208
I know for a fact he did
and good riddance.

129
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,417
Let her keep his dirty dick.

130
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,917
[student 2] He is not
hooking up with Tiffany.

131
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,167
[student 1] Bullshit.
Tiffany told me herself.

132
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,000
She showed me a hickey.
It was shaped like Cody's dirty mouth.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,833
[student 2] Okay, well,
y'all should come over later.

134
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,125
Okay, we're gonna grill by the pool
and Cody will be there,

135
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,625
so you can just ask him yourself.

136
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,375
Okay. Cody's going to be there?

137
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:35,083
Yes, you best believe my ass will be there
'cause I'm done with these rumors.

138
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,750
[teacher] Okay. Sounds like
most of us are done with the assignment.

139
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:43,042
So let's talk about being naked in public.

140
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,625
Is that an ethics question?

141
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,708
Yes, Adam.

142
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,292
Well, that depends on
the laws of the land.

143
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,458
[teacher] Exactly.

144
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,167
Banning public nudity is a rule
of a particular society, our society,

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,250
especially this classroom.

146
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,375
But what about Christian ethics?

147
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,458
How do they differ
from the law of the land?

148
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,375
[school bell rings]

149
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:10,500
[teacher] Whoa, what's your hurry?
Am I that boring?

150
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,917
Oh, excuse me.

151
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,417
Yeah, okay.

152
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,583
[high-pitched sustained beep]

153
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,292
[Mom] Do you hear it? It's like...
[screeches]

154
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:26,000
It's got to be driving him insane.

155
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:30,375
Do not worry, honey.
I'm going to fix this.

156
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,625
[Doris] I doubt he hears it.

157
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,625
Here, get up. I need your chair.

158
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,958
[beep continues]

159
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,792
Of course-- I told that robot
at the front desk,

160
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,292
but of course she didn't do anything.

161
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:42,625
Mia? You seriously don't like her?

162
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,542
She's, like, the nicest person
I've ever met.

163
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:49,417
Yeah, well, she's a toddler.
She just goes around smiling.

164
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:52,208
You shouldn't walk around grinning
if your job is watching people die,

165
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,042
and your brother is stuck here
with this horrible noise.

166
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,375
Here.

167
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,875
Help me up,
I'm gonna stick my head up here.

168
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,042
See what the fuck is going on.

169
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,125
Mom!

170
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,958
For the love of God, Doris,

No offense.

490
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:11,083

going to the public school

after some kid shot a math teacher.

492
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:15,708
So she has to work all the time
to pay my tuition.

493
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:17,542
She never shuts up about it.

494
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,000
She's a good mom.

495
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,000
Um... no.

496
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,083
To my brother, maybe, but not to me.

Terri went to Catholic school.

498

[Doris] How do you know?

499
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,167
- [Paul] Just do.
- [Doris] Do you know her?

500
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,917
- Well, no. I don't know her personally.
- What do you mean?

501
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,167
I don't know her.

502

But when I found out
that her psychotic husband

503
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:51,667
was trying to murder her,
I had to come here and do something.

504

Murder her? But...
You know, she's basically already dead.

505

She's as alive as you are.

506

And what if it was you
in there instead of her?

507
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:10,708
Bottom line is, her husband
didn't want to take care of her anymore.

Honestly, I get that.

00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,667
Sometimes you need a break.

511
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,792
[Paul] Are you enjoying your break?

512
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:29,375
I mean, this is going to sound horrible,

513
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,458
but... yeah.

514
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,125
Once your brother's gone, he's gone...

515
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,667
and he is never coming back.
And you will miss taking care of him.

516
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:47,458
- [Doris] No, I won't.
- [Paul] You will.

517
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:52,000
[Paul] You'll miss everything.
All the good, all the bad...

518
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,333
Hell, especially the bad.

519
00:33:55,333 --> 00:34:01,000
I'd give anything to hear my wife yell
at me for letting the mosquitoes inside.

520
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,750
Just talk to her, you know?

521
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,583
Well, I haven't talked
to my brother in years.

522
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,667
He's not really aware.

523
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,583
[Paul] Well, you should talk to him.

524
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:22,500
When they go, suddenly you got
all this important shit to say to 'em.

525
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:26,208
Or not important shit. You just want to...

526
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,875
Just want to tell 'em stuff.

527
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,083
Hi.

528
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,042
[students chattering]

529
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,708
- [Laci] Look at Nate. Such a dork.
- [Megan] Aw, Nate.

530
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:36,667
[Brittany] Oh, my God. What is that?
Are you dancing?

531
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,708
Hey, don't hate on my moves. Okay?
I was killin' that.

532
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,792
Oh, Doris, come here.

533
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,583
- [Laci] Hey, girl.
- [Doris] Hey.

534
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:49,958
- These are from your party.
- That shit was off the chain.

535
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:54,042
Oh, really? Thanks. I had fun too.

536
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:57,167
Hey, so my birthday is this weekend.

537
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,375
Could we maybe have
another party at your house?

538
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,583
Well, my mom won't be home, so...

539
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:06,083
- Yeah, definitely.
- Amazing.

540
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,375
Wait, do you smoke weed?

541
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,625
Oh...

542
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:15,333
Not right now.
But I'm thinking about starting soon.

543
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,208
Yeah, I do.

544
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,292
[Brittany] Cool.

545
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:22,833
[Brittany] Oh, my God.

546
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,375
[upbeat music]

547
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,042
Oh, my God.

548
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,458
[Megan] Do we need to, like,
take you to the hospital?

549
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:36,583
Oh, guess who texted me last night?

550
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,167
Oh, my God. Aaron Miller?

551
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:40,250
- [Brittany] Correct.
- [Doris] Who?

552
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,833
You don't know Aaron Miller?

553
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,167
- No.
- Do you not, like, live in this town?

554
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,125
[Brittany] He's a few years older than us.

555
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,125
He's so hot.

556
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,250
- Ew.
- Ew.

557
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,500
He is, he is.

558
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,042
We dated for almost a year, but...

559
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,917
he broke it off last month
because he said, I'm, like...

560
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,958
like, immature.

561
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:05,833
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

562
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,958
I feel like only a really immature person
would be callous enough

563
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,458
to call someone else immature.

564
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,750
Holy shit.

565
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,583
You're so right.

566
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:22,417
Wow. I've, like, never
thought about it like that.

567
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,792
Yeah, that was, like,
some deep shit, Doris.

568
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,750
Ooh, Deep Doris.

569
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,125
Okay. Well, Deep Doris,
you just earned yourself a keg stand.

570
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,292
What?

571
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:38,625
- You don't know what a keg stand is?
- No.

572
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,083
Oh, my God, you're like an alien.

573
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,583
[Brittany] Dude, you asked me
if cheese was a vegetable

574
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,625
- and you're calling her an alien?
- No!

575
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,792
No, that was, like, five years ago.

576
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,292
- That was not five years ago.
- Yes, it was.

577
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,125
- More like months.
- It was five...

578
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,042
So, this is going to be so much fun.

579
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:02,583
Just put your hands right here...
and trust them.

580
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,833
It'll be fun, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.

581
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:06,333
[Doris] Oh, my God!

582
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,958
[all] One, two, three...

583
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,458
[Brittany] What?

584
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,375
What?

585
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:51,167
What the fuck is he doing?
Run, you dumbass!

586
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,917
- Okay. Guess what I heard?
- What?

587
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,417
Nate has a crush on Doris.

588
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,375
What? Yeah, right.

589
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,625
- No way.
- Wait. Where'd you hear that?

590
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:04,000
[Brittany] Aw, that's so hot.

591
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,167
The two of you together,
I would die of horniness.

592
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,667
- But who told you that?
- Do you like him?

593
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,542
I don't know.

594
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:14,292
Oh, if you do, I can, like,
totally make it happen.

595
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:19,250
Yeah. I mean, he's not all, like,
deep and quiet or whatever like you are,

596
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,083
but he's a little panty melter, right?

597
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:25,083
I mean, he's sort of cute.

598
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:26,917
Oh, my God.

599
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:28,250
- She loves him.
- She loves him.

600
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,792
You love him.

601
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:34,292
- You should go to prom with him.
- What? Okay, yeah.

602
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,708
Now that that's out there,
you're going with him.

603
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,667
I'm sorry. You're going. You have to.

604
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,875
Yeah, but don't get her hopes up because
he might not, like, actually be into her.

605
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,625
Ew.

606
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,625
You sound really jealous, and it's boring.

607
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,042
So boring.

608
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:53,917
[Laci] Can I put some gel in your hair?

609
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:56,958
Oh, I hate my hair.
I don't know what to do with it.

610
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,875
You should straighten that shit.

611
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,208
I would, like, kill myself
if I had curly hair.

612
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,292
Well, I wish you had curly hair.

613
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,667
Where's your gel? I want to mess with it.

614
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:09,500
My mom might have some
in the bathroom closet.

615
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,583
Okay.

616
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:16,625
Oh, no, not in there.

617
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,333
Whoa...

618
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,333
Why do you have, like, a hospital in here?

619
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,042
It's for my brother.

620
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,542
He was sick for a long time, so...

621
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:29,875
That's, like, heavy shit.

622
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,250
[Laci] Did he, like, die?

623
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,875
[Doris] No. But he is at Suncoast Hospice.

624
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,958
[Brittany] Shut up. With Terri Schiavo?

625
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,708
[Megan] That is so cool.
Wait, like, do you, like, know her?

626
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,583
Wait, can you get us on the news?

627
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,625
[Brittany] Can I have one of these?

628
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,333
[Doris] Sure.

629
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,417
Tight.

630
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:59,292
- [Megan] Guys, this is so sad.
- [Brittany] I know. You want one?

631
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,375
[Megan] Yeah.

632
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,583
All right. I will see you later.

633
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,292
[Doris] Wait. Can you take me home?

634
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,625
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to go home.

635
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:15,333
You're home alone too much.

636
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:20,458
[Mom] He needs visitors. He needs family.

637
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,125
And he shouldn't be alone with Mia.

638
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,333
I honestly-- I think she's a sociopath.

639
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:31,417
I saw her pushing a dead body
down the hallway, whistling showtunes.

640
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,042
Oh, God, don't pout.

641
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:40,542
Look, I'll...
I'll take you home after my shift.

642
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,167
You really should spend some time
with him while you can.

643
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,750
All right, sweetheart.

644
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,958
I'm going to work, and I'll be back here
as soon as I can, okay?

645
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,208
All right.

646
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:06,208
[laughing]

647
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,708
I didn't say that.

648
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,792
[kids clamoring]

649
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,208
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

650
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,292
All right, never have I ever...

651
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,333
waxed my pubes.

652
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:24,083
- You're such a freakin' dick.
- Wow.

653
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,125
[Nate] Don't hate me, hate the game.

654
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,792
[Brittany] The game?

655
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,792
Dare.

656
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,667
I dare...

657
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:40,042
- all the boys to...
- You can't do that.

658
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:42,042
- It's got to be one person.
- Kyle, Kyle, shut up.

659
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:44,042
Okay, it's fine.

660
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,875
Thank you. Thank you.

661
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,250
I dare all the boys to...

662
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:52,042
to take off their clothes.

663
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:55,833
I just stood up for her too.

664
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,417
That's crazy, that's crazy.

665
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,000
- Ah.
- Evening, ma'am.

666
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,167
Look who it is. My hero.

667
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:12,458
Listen, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but no visitors are allowed tonight.

668
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:16,000
[officer] The judge just set a date
to remove her feeding tube. So we're...

669
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,208
I don't give a shit what he did,
I'm going to go to sleep next to my son.

670
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:22,833
[officer] I can't let you do that.
No one is allowed in until morning.

671
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,292
Why? What is the problem?

672
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,375
What? You think I'm going to
sneak Schiavo a sandwich?

673
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:28,792
- I'm going.
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

674
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:32,333
Ma'am, I will have to place you
under arrest if you do not cooperate.

675
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,292
Are you kidding me?

676
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,875
Look, I...

677
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:48,250
I think we got off on the wrong foot here,

678
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,167
and I understand
you're just following orders, but...

679
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:53,542

the greatest thing in the world, and...

00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,292
[Megan] Do you have another one like that?

851
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,417
[Sweet'N Low] Yes, I do.

852
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:50,792
Thank you.

853
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:53,667
Dor?

854
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:56,333
- How much are they?
- A hundred.

855
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,958
I don't have that right now.

856
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:00,667
[Doris] Thank you, anyway.

857
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:03,958
Yeah.

858
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,500
[Sweet'N Low] I'mma get you.

859
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:16,292
It's about to expire.
You can just have it.

860
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:17,500
Pro bono.

861
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:20,708
Oh, Doris, that's perfect.

862
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:24,417
Okay.

863
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:27,708
Yeah. Thank you, Sweet'N Low.

864
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,125
- [Brittany] Bye.
- [Doris] Bye, guys.

865
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,167
[officer] Hey, there.
You mind popping the trunk for me?

866
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,958
They were just dropping me off.
They're leaving now.

867
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,458
- [Megan] See you tomorrow.
- [Nate] Peace.

868
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,792
[Megan] Can't believe she lives here.

869
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,042
Get in. You're driving me to the store.

870
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,333
Seriously? You're letting me drive?

871
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:51,333
Yeah. This isn't for you.
I'm sick of driving.

872
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:55,333
What are you waiting for? Come on.

873
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:07,500
Okay, normal girl. Show me what you got.

874
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:15,250
Um. Don't freak out,
'cause I, like, know the answer, but...

875
00:58:16,417 --> 00:58:18,542
which pedal's go and which is stop?

876
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:21,167
Are you serious?

877
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,208
Get the hell out of my car.

878
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:36,625
[Paul] Okay, first things first.
What's first?

879
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:40,500
Seatbelt?

880
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,375
Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you right now.

881
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:47,042
I think I'm going to cry. Yes. Seatbelt.
Put the seatbelt on.

882
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:51,750
Good. Now, second thing.

883
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:56,125
You want to make sure
that your mirrors are in the right place.

884
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:59,375
So can you see out the back? This one?

885
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,375
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

886
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,208
Now, what about the side mirrors?
Can you see everything to either side?

887
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,083
[Doris] Yeah.

888
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:11,583
[Paul] Now you take your foot off the
brake and hit the gas on the right.

889
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:13,500
Right there. Yeah. Hit it.

890
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,417
Good. Go. Good. Okay. You gotta steer.

891
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:18,250
[Paul] You gotta steer. Are you steering?

892
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,542
[happy music plays]

893
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:20,667
[Paul] Good, good. You're doing good.

894
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:23,417
La, la, la... Over, over, over.

895
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:25,500
Okay, Just stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

896
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:27,333
Stop.

897
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:30,083
Okay, good.
You've got the brakes worked out.

898
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:33,792
Now go easy. Just take it easy.

899
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:37,042
You don't have to press down
so hard on the gas, but...

900
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:39,333
Okay, watch out for that shed.

901
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:40,875
Oh, whoa, whoa. Okay.

902
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:43,208
Try to avoid... To the left.

903
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,042
[Paul] Just steer to the right.
To the right.

904
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:51,167
Okay, now turn-- Left, left. Get around.

905
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,875
Okay, no, but you don't have to go.
Watch out for the barrel!

906
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,250
Watch out for the barrel!

907
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,083
[happy music continues]

908
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:02,750
Look, it's not even an expensive car, but...

909
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,333
- I'm sorry.
- You know, it runs.

910
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:08,333
[Paul] Just try to go straight. You don't
have to go to the right or to the left.

911
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:11,417
Good. Good. Nice and slow. Straight.

912
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,833
Bravo.

913
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:17,958
This is good driving.

914
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,792
- [Paul] Good. Okay, stop, stop.
- [Doris] Which way?

915
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:22,333
[Paul] Yeah. Toward us.

916
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:29,500
Oh, thank you, God. Thank you for letting
me live through this.

917
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:54,083
[gentle music]

918
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:18,250
[birds chirping]

919
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:24,583
[Sue] Oh, good morning.

920
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:36,542
How are you doing?

921
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,333
I'm okay.

922
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,417
I just...

923
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:52,583
I keep thinking about
when I was pregnant with my son.

924
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:56,042
There was this anticipation.

925
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:58,125
I was waiting because he was...

926
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,667
arriving at any moment, and I wondered...

927
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,250
what would he be like?

928
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,542
What would he bring into my life?

929
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,458
But now I'm waiting for him to leave.

930
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:17,625
And I wonder,
what is he going to take from my life?

931
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,625
It's kind of funny.

932
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:26,375
It must be very hard.

933
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,250
I'm so sorry you're going through this.

934
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,958
[Mom] Since we're the only people out
here...

935
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,250
[Sue] Makes sense.

936
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:51,333
I've been the mom
of a sick kid for so many years,

937
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,875
I don't know
who I'm gonna be when he's gone.

938
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,833
Do you have any other children?

939
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:01,417
No.

940
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:07,333
Oh, my God. Yes. Yes. Christ. Yes.

941
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:11,375
Of course. Of course,
I have another child.

942
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,750
I don't know,
I don't know why I just said that.

943
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,875
No, I have a daughter.

944
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:22,333
[Sue] Well, she'll still be here
after he's gone.

945
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:29,125
Life will still be here after he's gone.
It's just going to look different.

946
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:35,750
[teacher] Then in 2003,
they were removed again.

947
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,042
[Nate] We're going out tonight, yes?

948
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:38,958
One billion percent.

949
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:41,583
I just pray my mom goes to sleep
so I can sneak out.

950
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:44,000
[Brittany] She will.
You gotta think positive.

951
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,292
[teacher] Brittany. What's your opinion?

952
01:03:47,042 --> 01:03:49,250
A... bout what?

953
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,458
[teacher] Terri Schiavo, the person
we've been discussing all morning?

954
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:57,542
Right. Yeah.
Full disclosure, I haven't been listening.

955
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:04,750
But I will say I just think
the whole Schiavo thing is just gross.

956
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,250
[teacher] And why is that?

957
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,458
Because people should be allowed to die.

958
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:11,375
Like she told her husband to let her die
if she ever ended up like that.

959
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:14,417
And all these nosy-ass people
just need to respect her wishes.

960
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,833
[teacher] I didn't ask you,
but thank you, Laci.

961
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:21,458
I mean, you really should be asking Doris.

962
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,042
She, like, basically knows Terri Schiavo.

963
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:26,875
[Laci] Yeah, her brother's in hospice
with Schiavo right now.

964
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,167
Who's Doris?

965
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,292
I am.

966
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:34,958
You don't have to talk about this
if you don't want to, Doris.

967
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:37,208
No, it's okay.

968
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,583
It's just, it's sort of hard
to talk about it like this.

969
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,250
Like, the way we talk
about stuff in this class.

970
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,292
What do you mean?

971
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:47,667
Just, like, I don't know...

972
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:50,500
We sit here and we talk
about hypothetical situations

973
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,375
and what the right or wrong action is,

974
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:55,583
but you can't really answer
those questions 'cause you don't know.

975
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,333
You don't know what's right or wrong
until it's happening to you.

976
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:02,292
Like, we can say Terri's husband is
a monster for wanting to let her die,

977
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:04,583
or her parents are monsters
for wanting her to live.

978
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,875
But we don't know, do we?

979
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,625
Because we're not them.

980
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:14,500
I guess you don't know
what's ethical... until you know.

981
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,667
[school bell rings]

982
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:19,167
That was so dope.

983
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:20,583
[Laci] So smart, Doris.

984
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,833
[Brittany] See you, tonight, baby.

985
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:41,208
- Doris.
- Hmm?

986
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,500
I just want to say I...

987
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I know it's hard
sleeping here every night.

988
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:52,542
And I know you're a good kid.

989
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,458
I mean, the whole
party thing was partly my fault,

990
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:59,083
I shouldn't have left you home alone.

991
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:04,917
Okay.

992
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:06,958
Thank you.

993
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,417
[phone buzzes]

994
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:21,500
Man, I'm so tired.

995
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,583
Night, Mom.

996
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,208
You know...

997
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,417
if you forget how tragic this place is,

998
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:33,792
it's... almost like
we're having a slumber party.

999
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,583
Yep.

1000
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,750
Remember when you were little?

1001
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:49,000
We'd build forts in the living room,
and you'd always yell, "Slumber party!"

1002
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:03,417
We're going to have fun again, you and me,

1003
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:07,167
when this is over, I'll...

1004
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,750
I'll learn how to be fun again.

1005
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:21,583
Mom, you should really get some sleep.
You've been working so hard.

1006
01:07:24,292 --> 01:07:25,708
Okay. Okay.

1007
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:29,375
Jeez. Goodnight.

1008
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,292
[Laci] I believe in psychics.

1009
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:04,875
- [Brittany] What?
- [Laci] I do.

1010
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:08,208
- [Laci] Oh, my God, she made it out.
- [Brittany] Holy crap.

1011
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,500
[Brittany] I am legit scared of your mom.

1012
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,708
I was like, "That bitch is gonna
run out here and stab us."

1013
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:17,042
[Laci] Here, I brought you an outfit,
but one of the boot heels is broken,

1014
01:08:17,042 --> 01:08:20,250
so just, like, don't dance too hard
or you'll fully face plant.

1015
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,417
Got it. Thank you.

1016
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:25,000
[Brittany] Okay, so Nate and Megan
are meeting us there.

1017
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,917
- Oh, and Cody.
- Oh, have you met him yet?

1018
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:29,667
- [Doris] No.
- [Brittany] You're going to hate him.

1019
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:30,833
Well, look, he got me this.

1020
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:33,500
You know, it's like,
a promise to stop being like,

1021
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
a liar and an asshole and stuff.

1022
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,792
Well, whatever you want to do,
I support you.

1023
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,792
I just want you to be happy.

1024
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:42,708
You see, Brit?
That is what a real friend looks like.

1025
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,833
Whatever. Easy for you to say, Doris.

1026
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:48,167
You haven't been dealing
with this shit for four years.

1027
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,250
Four years?

1028
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,542
No, it's not four years,
it's actually three.

1029
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:52,792
'Cause the first year,

1030
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:54,542
- he was not an asshole.
- What are you talking about?

1031
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:57,750
When I first started dating Cody,
he was such a sweetheart.

1032
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:59,417
I would do anything to go back.

1033
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:01,292
[Brittany] You were just brainwashed.

1034
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,125
- I'm so nervous.
- No, girl, we're fine.

1035
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:09,000
But definitely stop whispering.

1036
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:10,708

Your ID is gonna expire soon.

1040
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:31,667
Oh, yeah.

1041
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,750
Duh.

1042
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,708
I gotta go to the DMV
and get a new one 'cause--

1043
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:38,417
'cause that's where I got that one.

1044
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:42,333
But I mean, you knew that obviously,
'cause you work here, so...

[upbeat club music]

1046

I thought we were gonna
have to bail you out of jail.

1047
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:53,333
He definitely knew I was lying.
I almost passed out.

Yeah.

So drinks on me.

No, no, no, I got Doris.

What are you having?

1054
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:10,875
Vodka-cranberry, bitch.

Well, at least they're just dancing.

Excuse me, ladies.

[Laci] Really? Hi, sorry.
Are you freakin' serious?

- [Nate] All right, vodka-cranberry.
- [Doris] Thank you.

going to pass away tonight,

but you never know.

1095
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:50,458
He is in hospice.

Oh, that-that is great, Doris.

You break all the rules,
and I'm the bad guy.

You're a fucking monster.

I've always done
everything you asked me to.

1110

My entire childhood was wasted
taking care of him

1111

so I could go serve food to tourists?

Huh?

01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,583
You think I wanted to work
instead of be with my boy?

1116

I had to work so we could eat,
so we could pay rent.

I'm sorry I wasn't here.

- No!

I was so selfish. I was so awful to you.

[Doris] I should have made you brownies.
And I know you love them.

1377

And I never made them for you.

1378

I should have given you the remote.
I should have...

Oh, Dorie, you were so good to him.

1381

No. He knows.

I'm sorry. He was just really young,

1390
01:34:49,958 --> 01:34:53,000
and we don't get
a lot of young people here. So...

1391
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,292
Thank you...

1392
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,000

Okay, sweetheart.

City Hall.

wait outside until the...

Why aren't you with them?

01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,875
I just wanted to make sure
that you're all right.

1403
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,875
He died.

1404
01:37:06,917 --> 01:37:08,833
And it feels just like you said.

1405
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:14,958
But I think...

1406
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,542
No...

01:37:18,167 --> 01:37:19,542
I know...

1408
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,167
he's in a better place now,

1409
01:37:23,792 --> 01:37:25,792
and I know he's happier.

1410
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,375
He's free.

1411
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,125
I can feel it.

1412
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:36,125
And isn't heaven, like,
what you guys believe in?

1413
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:40,125
Isn't it supposed to be
a lot better than this place?
