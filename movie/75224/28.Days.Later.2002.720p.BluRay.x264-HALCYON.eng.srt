1
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:54,853
Bingo!

2
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,902
(chimps screeching)

3
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,041
Fucking hell.

4
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,753
(screech)

5
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:15,255
Fucking hell.

6
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,063
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

7
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,231
lf you wanna get 'em out of here.

8
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,736
- l can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

9
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,451
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...

10
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,765
l know who you are.
l know what you think...

11
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,682
lf you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

12
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:52,012
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

13
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:55,560
- lnfected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

14
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:58,609
lnfected with what?

15
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,449
Rage.

16
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:07,330
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

17
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,745
No! No! No!

18
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,755
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

19
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,417
We'll get you out of here.

20
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:20,171
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

21
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,755
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

22
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,225
(screaming)

23
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:32,150
Get it off! Help me!

24
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:39,655
Get it off! Get it off!

25
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:46,491
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

26
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:50,826
(screams) Oh, my God!

27
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:58,378
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

28
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,466
Oh, God...

29
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:04,048
(screaming)

30
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,923
(sharp intake of breath)

31
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:52,957
Hello?

32
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,394
(coughs)

33
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:32,916
Hello?

34
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,059
(louder) Hello!

35
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:25,181
(belches)

36
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,337
Hello?

37
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:04,157
Hello!

38
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,193
(alarm)

39
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:58,588
Hello?

40
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,682
Hello?

41
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:13,017
(noises from behind door)

42
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,532
(gasping and retching)

43
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,115
Father?

44
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:33,624
Father, are you OK?

45
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:43,644
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

46
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:46,302
Shouldn't have done that.

47
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:48,604
Shit!

48
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:17,509
(man) Over here!

49
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,716
- Over here!
- Come on!

50
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,653
Go, go, go!

51
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:43,994
Keep going!

52
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,952
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

53
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:57,667
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

54
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,245
Let's go! Let's go!

55
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,576
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

56
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,380
Come on!

57
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:03,322
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

58
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,407
The giraffe falls over.

59
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:10,708
The man goes to leave and the barman says
''Oi! You can't leave that lying there.''

60
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,842
He says ''No, it's not a lion. lt's a giraffe''.

61
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,347
He's completely humourless.

62
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,355
You two should get on like a house on fire.

63
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,936
So who are you?

64
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,064
You're from the hospital.

65
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,656
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

66
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,069
l'm a bicycle courier.

67
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:49,667
l was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

68
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:53,503
Then l wake up today in hospital.
l wake up and l'm...

69
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,502
l'm hallucinating or l'm...

70
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,635
What's your name?

71
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:01,800
Jim.

72
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:05,146
l'm Mark. This is Selena.

73
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,228
OK, Jim.

74
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,988
l've got some bad news.

75
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:25,330
lt started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

76
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:29,581
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

77
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:33,216
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

78
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:38,010
lt was in the street outside.
lt was coming through your windows.

79
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:39,924
lt was a virus.

80
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:41,807
An infection.

81
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:44,728
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

82
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:47,268
lt was the blood.

83
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:49,848
There was something in the blood.

84
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,278
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

85
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:59,284
The infection was everywhere.

86
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,861
The army blockades were overrun.

87
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,120
And that's when the exodus started.

88
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:10,254
The day before broadcasting stopped,

89
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,005
there were reports of lnfection
in Paris and New York.

90
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:19,305
We didn't hear anything more after that.

91
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:25,223
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

92
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:27,769
Of course there's a government!

93
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:31,938
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

94
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:36,323
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

95
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,869
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

96
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:45,660
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

97
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:48,578
Where's your family?

98
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:51,544
They're dead. Like Selena's.

99
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,756
Yours will be dead too.

100
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,059
Look, l have to find them.
They live in Deptford. l can walk it. OK?

101
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,723
You'll go and come back, yeah?

102
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,937
- You won't.
- Yes!

103
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:18,033
No one ever comes back.

104
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,616
So lesson one.

105
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:29,913
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

106
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:32,331
Lesson two.

107
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:36,505
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

108
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:40,596
We'll take you tomorrow.

109
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:44,266
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

110
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,772
Eat.

111
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:02,119
lf you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

112
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,686
- lf there's anyone...
- l understand.

113
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:32,854
- Anyone...
- l understand!

114
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:36,533
OK.

115
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,894
(sniffs)

116
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:19,656
Jim...

117
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:21,825
Wait!

118
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:50,452
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

119
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:52,956
l'm not grateful.

120
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,211
My...

121
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:01,427
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

122
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:09,401
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

123
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:12,400
l remember my dad had all this cash,

124
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:15,822
even though cash was completely useless.

125
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:20,488
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

126
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,206
Crowd was surging.

127
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:28,369
l lost my grip on my sister's hand.

128
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:32,874
l remember the ground was soft.

129
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:39,222
l looked down
and l was standing on all these people.

130
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:43,257
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

131
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:47,303
Somewhere in the crowd
there were lnfected. lt spread fast.

132
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,733
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

133
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:55,448
Climb over more people.
So l did that. l climbed.

134
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,906
And l got up on top of this kiosk.

135
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:05,163
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

136
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:09,119
Then l saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

137
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:11,171
My dad.

138
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:15,545
His face...

139
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:23,139
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

140
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:28,389
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

141
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:33,906
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

142
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,323
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. lt's safer.

143
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:54,194
(radio)

144
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:59,695
Jim.

145
00:28:08,381 --> 00:28:10,457
- You're back.
- Yeah.

146
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:18,924
- How was it?
- Fine.

147
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:22,306
Give me a drink of that, will ya?

148
00:28:22,395 --> 00:28:24,471
- lt's empty.
- Ha!

149
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:29,100
Here.

150
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:33,272
l'll start working on them, then.

151
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:41,906
Mark! Mark!

152
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,831
Selena! Help!

153
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:01,260
(Selena) lt's clear.

154
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:09,687
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

155
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:11,984
And his daughter. From four doors down.

156
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:15,156
- Were you bitten?
- No.

157
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:18,159
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

158
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,071
No.

159
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,953
Mark?

160
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,089
Wait...

161
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:34,465
(Mark screams)

162
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:54,153
Get that cleaned off.

163
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:58,111
Do you have any clothes here?

164
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:01,119
Um... l... Yes.

165
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:04,872
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

166
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:08,626
More lnfected will be coming.
They always do.

167
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:40,412
(Jim) How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?

168
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:44,412
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. lt was on you.

169
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:49,876
l didn't know he was infected.
He knew. l could see it in his face.

170
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:54,378
lf someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

171
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:59,596
lt might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. lt makes no difference.

172
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:05,106
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, l'll do it in a heartbeat.

173
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,401
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

174
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:13,946
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

175
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,524
Plans are pointless.

176
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,192
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

177
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,450
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

178
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,618
What's that?

179
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:32,793
Let's go.

180
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:21,052
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

181
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:24,229
Stop talking. lt's a long way up.

182
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,275
(Selena) Do you need a break?

183
00:32:37,495 --> 00:32:39,487
- You?
- No.

184
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:44,243
Now l do need a break.

185
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,547
What's up?

186
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,632
Nothin'.

187
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,348
l got a headache.

188
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,932
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

189
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:09,313
- Why didn't you say something before?
- l didn't think you'd give a shit.

190
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,777
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

191
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,990
So you're crashing.

192
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,319
There isn't a lot we can do about that

193
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:24,491
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

194
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,874
Pepsi or Lilt?

195
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,123
Do you have any Tango?

196
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,253
Actually,
l did have a can of Tango somewhere.

197
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,376
(screech)

198
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,712
Quiet! That's an lnfected.

199
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,894
Oh no, they're in. Move!

200
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,528
Wait up, Selena!

201
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,444
Wait for me, please!

202
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,660
Please, Selena! Please!

203
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,073
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

204
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,159
- Run!
- Wait!

205
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:07,499
Please! For fuck's sake!

206
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,331
- Selena!
- (screams)

207
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:15,421
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

208
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,590
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:32,110
Open the door!

210
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:39,281
Open the door!

211
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:46,493
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

212
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:48,046
What?

213
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:53,635
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

214
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:56,009
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

215
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,228
Go in. Go in!

216
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:10,897
( ''Frosty the Snowman'")

217
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:26,708
So, l'm Frank, anyway.

218
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:28,588
Jim.

219
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:32,509
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

220
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:34,883
This is my daughter Hannah.

221
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:37,213
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

222
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:40,719
Come on.

223
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:43,436
So...

224
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:45,432
This is great. Just great.

225
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:50,065
Calls for a celebration, l'd say.

226
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:53,191
Why don't you all sit down and...

227
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:56,237
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

228
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:58,819
We've got Mum's creme de menthe.

229
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:01,618
Great. Creme de menthe.

230
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:04,412
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

231
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:06,958
Get comfortable.

232
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,801
- (Frank) Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.

233
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:15,757
Nah, the good ones. lt's a celebration.

234
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:18,339
Top cupboard.

235
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:21,138
So this is your place?

236
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,140
lt's nice.

237
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,443
There.

238
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:41,623
l know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

239
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:43,452
Cheers.

240
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:00,301
(groans)

241
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:07,059
You OK in there, Jim?

242
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:10,353
Yeah.

243
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:16,034
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

244
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:19,946
You'll have to use the bucket.

245
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:29,126
Have to empty it each morning.

246
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:32,882
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

247
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,678
lt's fine.

248
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:37,883
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

249
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,933
We have a spare room.

250
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:44,261
ln there.

251
00:37:44,357 --> 00:37:46,314
Are you and Selena...?

252
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,395
No. No, no, no.

253
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:51,148
Um...

254
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,612
l'll take the living room. lt's fine.

255
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,573
Right.

256
00:37:56,453 --> 00:37:58,529
No, l mean, yeah.

257
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:01,574
So, um...

258
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:05,627
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

259
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,812
Very spruce.

260
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:25,983
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

261
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:34,022
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

262
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,995
Probably need us more than we need them.

263
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:41,698
l think they're good people.

264
00:38:44,545 --> 00:38:47,499
- Good people?
- Yeah.

265
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,962
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

266
00:38:54,055 --> 00:38:57,803
- Because if they slowed you down...
- l'd leave them behind.

267
00:38:57,893 --> 00:38:59,802
- ln a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

268
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,180
l wouldn't.

269
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:05,806
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

270
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,651
l'm gonna get some sleep.

271
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:21,038
Selena...

272
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:25,126
You think l don't get it, but l do get it.

273
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:31,003
And l know l'd be dead already
if l hadn't met you.

274
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,088
Sure.

275
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:34,756
No, look...

276
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:39,218
l mean, thank you.

277
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:44,555
And l mean, sure.

278
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,437
Goodnight, Jim.

279
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:49,604
Goodnight.

280
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:05,287
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

281
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,508
l thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

282
00:40:09,592 --> 00:40:12,795
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

283
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,807
You drink it,

284
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,684
it evaporates,

285
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,846
turns stagnant.

286
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:26,309
They're all empty.

287
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,186
Hasn't rained in ten days.

288
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,527
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

289
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:37,366
Saw it on TV once, but l can't make it work.

290
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:40,782
You'd never think it.

291
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:44,663
Needing rain so badly.

292
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:48,746
Not in fucking England!

293
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,549
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

294
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:09,232
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

295
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:13,899
(man on radio) Salvation is here.
The answer to lnfection is here.

296
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:16,994
if you can hear this, you're not alone.

297
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,576
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.

298
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:23,874
We are soldiers and we are armed.

299
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:27,247
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

300
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,918
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,

301
00:41:32,012 --> 00:41:35,428
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

302
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:39,430
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now itjust repeats.

303
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,892
- lt's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

304
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:44,898
But this is where it's telling us to go.

305
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:47,142
Just there.

306
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:53,446
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

307
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:55,242
''We''?

308
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:05,417
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.

309
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:08,671
- Look, l didn't...
- No, it's OK. lt's the truth.

310
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,250
l can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

311
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:15,294
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. l couldn't risk it.

312
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:17,099
But with other people...

313
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:21,478
lf it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

314
00:42:21,564 --> 00:42:25,063
- lt's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to lnfection...

315
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:29,445
There is no answer!
lt's already done all the damage it can!

316
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,365
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

317
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:36,530
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

318
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,911
Or die here.

319
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:46,706
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

320
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:50,089
We need each other.

321
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:55,467
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

322
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:58,259
So we have to try and get there.

323
00:42:59,395 --> 00:43:00,972
Get there how?

324
00:43:12,408 --> 00:43:16,156
Just so you know,
l don't take cheques or credit cards.

325
00:43:44,734 --> 00:43:47,735
- (Frank) What do you think?
- lt's the most direct route.

326
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:53,062
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

327
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,484
(Frank) Let's just get it done.

328
00:44:08,425 --> 00:44:10,583
(Jim) No, no.

329
00:44:10,678 --> 00:44:13,169
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

330
00:44:14,056 --> 00:44:17,425
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.

331
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:21,895
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

332
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:24,898
lt's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

333
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:27,225
Hold on!

334
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:38,286
Dad!

335
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,456
(screaming and laughing)

336
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,269
Fuck!

337
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:02,970
The world's worst place to get a flat.

338
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:06,399
Agreed. l think we'd better do this quick.

339
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:11,063
l've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

340
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:29,207
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

341
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:31,377
Hear what?

342
00:45:32,054 --> 00:45:34,342
(Hannah) Right, l've done it.

343
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,391
Dad?

344
00:45:37,477 --> 00:45:39,600
(scrabbling sounds)

345
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:44,356
- Jesus Christ!
- (Hannah screaming)

346
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:45,984
Fucking rats!

347
00:45:56,538 --> 00:45:59,111
They're running from the lnfected.

348
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,117
Move it!

349
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,504
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

350
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:08,839
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

351
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:14,762
Lift, lift!

352
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:20,433
- (Selena) Don't look at them! Don't look!
- (Jim) l can see them! They're coming!

353
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:24,099
(screeching)

354
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:28,725
Come on, Hannah!

355
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:31,229
Almost.

356
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:34,242
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- l'm trying.

357
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,710
Three, two, one,

358
00:46:41,794 --> 00:46:43,502
drop it!

359
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:50,088
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

360
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,552
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

361
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,553
(Jim) Whoo!

362
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:06,435
Goodbye, you fuckers!

363
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:16,699
Frank, stop the cab.

364
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:41,976
Let's shop.

365
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,980
(Frank making engine noises)

366
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:54,112
You...

367
00:47:54,912 --> 00:47:56,406
You...

368
00:47:57,248 --> 00:47:58,327
You...

369
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,989
(Jim) Anybody seen any buns?

370
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:03,872
Hmm. lrradiated.

371
00:48:06,591 --> 00:48:10,173
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

372
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:12,087
l think you can eat that raw.

373
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,053
Decaffeinated coffee...

374
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,216
Put that back.

375
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:19,676
Can'tjust take any crap.

376
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:24,267
lf l never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

377
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,362
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

378
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,607
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

379
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,534
Warm but not aggressive.

380
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,120
- (Hannah and Selena laughing)
- Peaty aftertaste.

381
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,960
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

382
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:41,938
Either we do this now or we're walking.

383
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:51,024
Not you.

384
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,658
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

385
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,823
You heard.

386
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:27,478
Where are you going?

387
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:30,979
We've got enough food, Jim.

388
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:33,400
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

389
00:50:34,162 --> 00:50:36,831
(quietly) Like going on holidays
with your aunt!

390
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,494
Oh, Jesus.

391
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:45,860
Hello?

392
00:51:59,668 --> 00:52:01,459
l hate you!

393
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:12,713
Find anything?

394
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,762
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

395
00:52:17,853 --> 00:52:19,929
OK, we're done here.

396
00:52:22,149 --> 00:52:24,022
OK, Hannah.

397
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:33,069
Easy. Brake!

398
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:35,237
Brake, brake!

399
00:52:43,088 --> 00:52:45,164
Out.

400
00:53:29,762 --> 00:53:32,965
(Selena) Mmmm! Oh my God!

401
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:36,725
l can, like, taste the vitamin C.

402
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:40,349
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

403
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:43,642
What did you say?

404
00:53:43,735 --> 00:53:46,522
The raisins. They're so moist.

405
00:53:51,284 --> 00:53:53,360
Look over here.

406
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:06,499
Like a family.

407
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:09,047
(Hannah) Do you think they're infected?

408
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,546
(Frank) No.

409
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:17,721
They're doing just fine.

410
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:25,560
Come on. Let's eat!

411
00:54:40,252 --> 00:54:41,580
Know what l was thinking?

412
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,370
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

413
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:49,629
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

414
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,512
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

415
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:02,272
Um.... that's what you were thinking.

416
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:04,231
No.

417
00:55:05,487 --> 00:55:07,775
l was thinking l was wrong.

418
00:55:09,032 --> 00:55:11,108
About what?

419
00:55:12,828 --> 00:55:14,904
All the death.

420
00:55:15,497 --> 00:55:17,573
All this shit.

421
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:23,705
lt doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

422
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:28,542
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

423
00:55:28,636 --> 00:55:30,759
Cheeky monkey!

424
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:34,840
l was wrong when l said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

425
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:40,970
See, that's what l was thinking.

426
00:55:41,483 --> 00:55:43,143
Was it?

427
00:55:43,234 --> 00:55:45,522
Mm. You stole my thought.

428
00:55:50,742 --> 00:55:52,615
Sorry.

429
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:55,452
That's OK.

430
00:55:55,539 --> 00:55:57,615
You can keep it.

431
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:02,748
lt's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

432
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:20,350
l can't sleep.

433
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,061
Me neither.

434
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:25,523
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

435
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:27,688
Outside like this.

436
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:30,980
l think we're safe enough.

437
00:56:31,076 --> 00:56:33,745
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

438
00:56:34,455 --> 00:56:36,946
Yeah, l noticed that.

439
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:38,535
Hey, Selena...

440
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:40,702
What? What is it?

441
00:56:42,046 --> 00:56:44,085
How'd you get to sleep?

442
00:56:50,555 --> 00:56:54,422
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

443
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:58,811
l didn't need a prescription.
l qualified as a chemist.

444
00:56:58,897 --> 00:57:01,435
Oh, great. Valium.

445
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:04,098
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

446
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:07,894
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

447
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,231
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

448
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:12,364
Can l, Dad?

449
00:57:12,453 --> 00:57:14,445
l don't think so, sweetheart.

450
00:57:14,538 --> 00:57:16,032
Please?

451
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:19,617
- No.
- l can't sleep.

452
00:57:22,713 --> 00:57:25,417
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

453
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:30,506
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

454
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,148
Night-night.

455
00:57:43,944 --> 00:57:46,565
You're a big softie, Frank.

456
00:58:17,187 --> 00:58:19,144
Frank?

457
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:21,307
Hannah?

458
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,273
Frank?

459
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:30,984
Hello? Hello!

460
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:33,281
Hello!

461
00:58:33,371 --> 00:58:35,862
Hello! Hello!

462
00:58:40,837 --> 00:58:42,913
(mumbles)

463
00:58:43,965 --> 00:58:46,041
Shh...

464
00:58:47,427 --> 00:58:50,214
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

465
00:58:52,974 --> 00:58:55,050
Thanks, Dad.

466
00:59:25,925 --> 00:59:28,048
(car horn)

467
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:32,920
Come on, sleepyhead.

468
00:59:36,603 --> 00:59:38,679
Come on, Babe Ruth.

469
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,773
(Frank) Hurry up.

470
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:49,028
- Did l miss breakfast?
- (Selena) You'll sleep through anything.

471
00:59:49,116 --> 00:59:54,110
- (Jim) Did you have a fry-up?
- (Frank) We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!

472
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:23,185
(radio) Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,

473
01:00:23,277 --> 01:00:26,361
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

474
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:28,356
You must find us. Please!

475
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:30,572
Salvation is here.

476
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,696
The answer to lnfection is here.

477
01:01:05,738 --> 01:01:07,814
Must be Manchester.

478
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:13,403
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

479
01:01:15,248 --> 01:01:17,573
No fire crews to put it out.

480
01:02:12,391 --> 01:02:14,964
42nd blockade.

481
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,385
This is it.

482
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:32,551
l don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

483
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,761
- l don't like this. l think we should go.
- No!

484
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:47,437
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

485
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:07,502
Nothing.

486
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:09,504
l can't believe it.

487
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:11,554
Frank...

488
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:13,889
Frank!

489
01:04:16,104 --> 01:04:17,764
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

490
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,346
Go fucking where?!

491
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:55,390
(cawing)

492
01:04:59,482 --> 01:05:01,640
Get out of it.

493
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:07,231
Get out of it!

494
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:27,624
Dad, are you all right?

495
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,389
Yeah, l'm fine, sweetheart.

496
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:34,011
Sorry l lost my temper.

497
01:05:34,102 --> 01:05:36,225
Hannah...

498
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:39,266
l love you very much.

499
01:05:39,357 --> 01:05:41,349
- What?
- Keep away from me.

500
01:05:41,443 --> 01:05:43,768
Stay where you are.

501
01:05:43,862 --> 01:05:46,779
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

502
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:49,356
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

503
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:52,570
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

504
01:05:54,081 --> 01:05:56,832
(Hannah) What's wrong? Dad!

505
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,537
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

506
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:06,254
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

507
01:06:06,344 --> 01:06:09,760
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

508
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:11,127
Kill him!

509
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,896
Stay away from him!

510
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:25,560
Keep away from the body!

511
01:06:28,325 --> 01:06:30,198
Dad?

512
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,269
(man) Three survivors. One male, two female.

513
01:06:55,353 --> 01:06:58,686
l repeat, one male, two female.

514
01:06:58,774 --> 01:07:01,347
ETA, 15.

515
01:07:01,443 --> 01:07:03,898
Put the kettle on.

516
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:54,362
l'm Major Henry West.

517
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,333
- Welcome.
- Jim.

518
01:07:57,418 --> 01:07:59,410
Hello, Jim.

519
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:01,247
Hello.

520
01:08:03,508 --> 01:08:08,383
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

521
01:08:08,471 --> 01:08:10,878
So you can all have a shower.

522
01:08:10,974 --> 01:08:14,307
You look like you need one. Please.

523
01:08:34,248 --> 01:08:39,455
lt ain't funny. l got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

524
01:08:40,547 --> 01:08:42,670
Run him over!

525
01:08:45,385 --> 01:08:48,172
(Jim) How is she doing?

526
01:08:48,263 --> 01:08:51,429
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

527
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:56,593
lt's all fucked.

528
01:08:56,688 --> 01:08:58,680
What do you mean?

529
01:09:03,737 --> 01:09:07,319
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

530
01:09:07,408 --> 01:09:09,484
Hey, don't do that.

531
01:09:11,162 --> 01:09:16,156
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like l'll cope.

532
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:20,164
- Just like you'll cope.
- l don't want her to have to fucking cope.

533
01:09:21,464 --> 01:09:23,871
l want her to be OK.

534
01:09:25,468 --> 01:09:27,626
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

535
01:09:27,721 --> 01:09:30,508
lt was OK for them and it was OK for us.

536
01:09:33,852 --> 01:09:36,259
Now it's all just fucked.

537
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:10,556
So you heard our broadcast?

538
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:14,140
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

539
01:10:14,228 --> 01:10:20,348
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

540
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:26,941
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to lnfection.

541
01:10:29,285 --> 01:10:31,361
Yeah.

542
01:10:31,454 --> 01:10:35,950
As l said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

543
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:39,251
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

544
01:10:39,337 --> 01:10:42,456
The fire drove hundreds of lnfected
out of Manchester.

545
01:10:42,549 --> 01:10:45,633
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

546
01:10:47,387 --> 01:10:50,008
But don't worry.

547
01:10:50,099 --> 01:10:52,590
You're quite safe here.

548
01:10:55,688 --> 01:11:01,560
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

549
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:05,185
High perimeter wall which helps.

550
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:09,528
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

551
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:14,281
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

552
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:22,455
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

553
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:24,956
The belly of the house. The heart.

554
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:30,294
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

555
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:32,467
The kitchen.

556
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,683
Here you are. l'll swap you.

557
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:37,973
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

558
01:11:38,065 --> 01:11:42,109
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

559
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:44,567
Jones, our resident tin opener.

560
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:47,657
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

561
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:50,360
l can't wait.

562
01:11:57,878 --> 01:12:00,119
And lastly, meet Mailer.

563
01:12:03,926 --> 01:12:05,883
Mailer, Jim.

564
01:12:05,969 --> 01:12:08,092
Jim, Mailer.

565
01:12:09,431 --> 01:12:11,969
Got infected two days ago.

566
01:12:12,059 --> 01:12:17,136
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

567
01:12:21,778 --> 01:12:23,854
Keeping him alive?

568
01:12:24,823 --> 01:12:28,867
The idea was to learn something
about lnfection.

569
01:12:30,203 --> 01:12:32,279
Have him teach me.

570
01:12:38,962 --> 01:12:41,038
And has he?

571
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:45,375
ln a way.

572
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:54,975
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

573
01:12:55,062 --> 01:12:57,220
Farm crops,

574
01:12:57,315 --> 01:12:59,984
raise livestock.

575
01:13:00,068 --> 01:13:02,475
He's telling me he's futureless.

576
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:11,990
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the lnfected take to starve to death.

577
01:13:45,115 --> 01:13:48,318
(singing)

578
01:13:51,747 --> 01:13:54,202
You'll have to wait and see

579
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:56,532
Hope it's chips, it's chips

580
01:13:56,627 --> 01:13:59,200
We hope it's chips, it's chips

581
01:14:00,798 --> 01:14:02,707
(cheering)

582
01:14:07,763 --> 01:14:10,170
Hat.

583
01:14:10,266 --> 01:14:12,757
So, what have we here?

584
01:14:15,605 --> 01:14:18,974
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

585
01:14:23,738 --> 01:14:26,489
- (man) Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!

586
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:29,030
- lt's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

587
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:32,322
Absolutely. l was going to propose a toast

588
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:35,533
but this omelette will do just as well.

589
01:14:38,128 --> 01:14:40,619
- To new friends.
- (all) New friends.

590
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,014
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

591
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:58,521
l thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

592
01:14:58,608 --> 01:15:00,481
Get rid of it.

593
01:15:02,946 --> 01:15:05,401
(man) Doris, you twat.

594
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:08,277
l don't suppose you can cook, can you?

595
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:14,575
l can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

596
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:19,210
What a fucking disappointment.
l saw those eggs, l thought it was Christmas.

597
01:15:19,296 --> 01:15:22,546
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

598
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:25,468
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

599
01:15:25,553 --> 01:15:29,597
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

600
01:15:29,682 --> 01:15:34,011
- You don't know nothing.
- l think Bill's got a point.

601
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:37,223
lf you look at the whole life of the planet,

602
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:39,224
we...

603
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:43,445
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

604
01:15:44,197 --> 01:15:46,652
So if the infection wipes us all out,

605
01:15:47,659 --> 01:15:49,947
that is a return to normality.

606
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:56,959
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

607
01:15:57,044 --> 01:16:00,294
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

608
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:03,085
Our spiritual guru.

609
01:16:03,176 --> 01:16:08,383
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

610
01:16:11,184 --> 01:16:15,312
This is what l've seen
in the four weeks since lnfection.

611
01:16:15,397 --> 01:16:18,018
People killing people.

612
01:16:18,108 --> 01:16:22,651
Which is what l saw in the four weeks before
lnfection, the four weeks before that...

613
01:16:22,738 --> 01:16:28,194
As far back as l care to remember,
people killing people.

614
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:31,903
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

615
01:16:40,214 --> 01:16:43,168
- You're not eating?
- l don't want to eat.

616
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:46,046
You must eat, Hannah.

617
01:16:46,137 --> 01:16:49,387
l don't want to eat.
l want to bury my dad.

618
01:16:50,308 --> 01:16:53,427
He's one of the people you're talking about.

619
01:16:56,231 --> 01:16:57,429
(explosion)

620
01:16:57,524 --> 01:16:59,563
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

621
01:17:00,277 --> 01:17:02,602
Move!

622
01:17:02,696 --> 01:17:04,984
Move! Move! Move!

623
01:17:06,742 --> 01:17:09,067
(siren)

624
01:17:13,874 --> 01:17:15,950
Enemy in front!

625
01:17:48,786 --> 01:17:51,277
Mick, l fucking got one!

626
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:54,990
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

627
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,927
Fucking hell! He bounced!

628
01:18:10,016 --> 01:18:11,593
Cease fire!

629
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:13,973
l ain't never seen that in my life!

630
01:18:14,062 --> 01:18:16,731
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!

631
01:18:16,815 --> 01:18:18,523
- Clear.
- Clear.

632
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:19,723
Yeah, yeah, clear.

633
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:32,405
Oh, hello!

634
01:18:32,498 --> 01:18:34,574
(woif whistle)

635
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:42,251
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

636
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,548
Cos you got me to protect you now.

637
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:51,636
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

638
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,185
Fuck you!

639
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,428
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

640
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,514
How about right now?

641
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,065
Mitchell!

642
01:19:01,654 --> 01:19:06,150
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

643
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,072
Sergeant Farrell!

644
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:16,911
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

645
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:20,454
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

646
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:24,752
Slow down.

647
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:30,843
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

648
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:33,638
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

649
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:39,097
The rest of you, go with him.

650
01:19:46,284 --> 01:19:48,360
My apologies.

651
01:19:52,123 --> 01:19:53,866
Drink?

652
01:19:58,755 --> 01:20:01,424
Look, we're grateful, OK?

653
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:05,719
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

654
01:20:05,804 --> 01:20:07,346
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

655
01:20:07,431 --> 01:20:12,591
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

656
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,979
l killed... l killed a boy.

657
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:29,403
A child?

658
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:32,865
Yes.

659
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:39,418
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

660
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:44,841
Survival.

661
01:20:48,265 --> 01:20:50,341
l understand.

662
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:55,219
l promised them women.

663
01:20:57,191 --> 01:20:59,267
What?

664
01:21:00,403 --> 01:21:04,187
Eight days ago l found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

665
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:10,075
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

666
01:21:10,163 --> 01:21:13,033
What could l say to him?

667
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:18,331
We fight off the lnfected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

668
01:21:19,256 --> 01:21:23,088
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

669
01:21:23,177 --> 01:21:29,297
l moved us from the blockade, l set the radio
broadcasting and l promised them women.

670
01:21:33,646 --> 01:21:36,018
Because women mean a future.

671
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,108
Selena! Hannah!

672
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,659
- What is it?
- We have to go.

673
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:50,821
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

674
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:55,831
Come on!

675
01:21:56,962 --> 01:21:58,919
We get in the car and we go!

676
01:22:00,299 --> 01:22:04,842
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

677
01:22:04,929 --> 01:22:08,179
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

678
01:22:08,265 --> 01:22:10,969
l'm not gonna let you keep them here!

679
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,969
You can't do this!

680
01:22:15,565 --> 01:22:17,853
Right, get him!

681
01:22:24,908 --> 01:22:27,233
l want to give you a chance.

682
01:22:27,327 --> 01:22:29,450
You can be with us.

683
01:22:31,081 --> 01:22:33,369
But l can't let them go.

684
01:22:39,006 --> 01:22:41,579
OK, Jim? OK.

685
01:22:46,263 --> 01:22:48,339
Him too.

686
01:23:01,446 --> 01:23:04,197
(Farrell) Smithers says
''Women and semen don't mix.''

687
01:23:04,282 --> 01:23:07,199
And Mr Burns says
''We all know what you think, Smithers.''

688
01:23:07,285 --> 01:23:10,202
And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.

689
01:23:10,288 --> 01:23:13,906
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

690
01:23:14,001 --> 01:23:18,413
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!

691
01:23:18,505 --> 01:23:21,790
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

692
01:23:21,884 --> 01:23:27,589
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!

693
01:23:28,641 --> 01:23:32,685
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

694
01:23:34,063 --> 01:23:37,182
Just imagine, just think about it.

695
01:23:38,234 --> 01:23:40,522
How could lnfection cross the oceans?

696
01:23:40,612 --> 01:23:44,906
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? lt can be stopped.

697
01:23:44,991 --> 01:23:47,695
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

698
01:23:47,786 --> 01:23:51,783
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

699
01:23:51,874 --> 01:23:55,207
Think! Actually think about it.

700
01:23:56,086 --> 01:23:59,668
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

701
01:24:03,844 --> 01:24:05,920
They quarantined us.

702
01:24:08,433 --> 01:24:12,810
''There is no lnfection.
lt's just people killing people.'' He's insane!

703
01:24:21,613 --> 01:24:24,068
Time to go.

704
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:27,526
Quarantine?

705
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:02,480
- Please...
- Believe me, l'm not interested.

706
01:25:03,574 --> 01:25:08,699
You see, l'm gonna have the black one.
And l'm gonna make her squirm.

707
01:25:08,787 --> 01:25:12,701
Mitchell, l swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

708
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:14,499
Move.

709
01:25:14,585 --> 01:25:16,458
Come on, move! Get up!

710
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:18,621
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

711
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:20,256
Get up!

712
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:22,582
Move your fucking arse!

713
01:25:43,615 --> 01:25:47,031
(Farrell) Come on then,
you fucking pansies. Do me first.

714
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:49,610
(Jones) No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.

715
01:25:49,705 --> 01:25:52,741
- (Farrell) So you're gonna stick me?
- (Jones) Shoot 'em!

716
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:55,502
- (Mitchell) Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!

717
01:25:55,586 --> 01:25:58,622
(Farrell) ls that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

718
01:25:58,714 --> 01:26:00,623
- l'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

719
01:26:00,717 --> 01:26:04,168
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

720
01:26:07,807 --> 01:26:09,680
l'm gonna enjoy this.

721
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:17,429
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

722
01:26:17,526 --> 01:26:21,689
- You wanna shoot me? l'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

723
01:26:22,948 --> 01:26:25,783
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

724
01:26:28,287 --> 01:26:31,490
- Jones, move it!
- l can see him! l can see him!

725
01:26:31,582 --> 01:26:33,658
Where are you?

726
01:26:41,259 --> 01:26:43,168
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

727
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:45,337
(gunfire)

728
01:26:51,937 --> 01:26:54,428
Oh no. We're fucked.

729
01:26:55,607 --> 01:26:57,101
We're fucked!

730
01:26:57,192 --> 01:26:58,567
Relax.

731
01:26:58,652 --> 01:27:02,103
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

732
01:27:02,197 --> 01:27:04,948
And no shooter.

733
01:27:05,034 --> 01:27:06,362
He's dead.

734
01:27:06,452 --> 01:27:08,528
(thunder)

735
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:45,104
(West) The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.

736
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:48,783
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

737
01:27:48,871 --> 01:27:51,409
which she certainly has no use for.

738
01:27:52,417 --> 01:27:54,243
You can't do it to Hannah.

739
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:58,035
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

740
01:27:58,131 --> 01:28:00,207
Yes, sir.

741
01:28:03,595 --> 01:28:05,671
(Hannah) No...

742
01:28:06,723 --> 01:28:08,799
(man) Ladies...

743
01:28:11,562 --> 01:28:14,349
- lt's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

744
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,773
- l thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

745
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,484
(Hannah) Selena!

746
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:21,646
Whoa, whoa, relax!

747
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,317
Selena!

748
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:34,496
Selena! Selena!

749
01:28:36,546 --> 01:28:40,674
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

750
01:28:42,552 --> 01:28:46,252
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

751
01:28:46,348 --> 01:28:50,511
lf you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

752
01:29:01,489 --> 01:29:03,861
lt's just polite.

753
01:29:09,831 --> 01:29:12,369
Yeah, all right.

754
01:29:12,459 --> 01:29:14,202
All right.

755
01:29:14,294 --> 01:29:17,164
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

756
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:44,187
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.

757
01:29:44,283 --> 01:29:46,441
Are you trying to kill me?

758
01:29:46,578 --> 01:29:48,784
No, sweetheart.

759
01:29:48,872 --> 01:29:51,410
l'm making you not care. OK?

760
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:54,950
What you doing?!

761
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:59,419
(siren)

762
01:29:59,508 --> 01:30:01,999
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

763
01:30:02,094 --> 01:30:03,292
Move!

764
01:30:03,387 --> 01:30:06,056
Stay here and put the dresses on.

765
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,682
Let's go! Go!

766
01:30:11,896 --> 01:30:14,469
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

767
01:30:14,565 --> 01:30:17,234
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

768
01:32:25,785 --> 01:32:27,861
Davis?

769
01:33:00,488 --> 01:33:02,480
(engine fails)

770
01:33:02,574 --> 01:33:04,400
Fuck it!

771
01:33:13,585 --> 01:33:15,376
(gunfire)

772
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,296
- What was that?
- Lightning.

773
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:02,293
l heard something.

774
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:07,010
lt sounded like a Claymore to me.

775
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:12,008
All right, l'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

776
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,687
Girls,

777
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,395
keep an eye on him, will ya?

778
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,487
Those pills,

779
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:33,074
l think they're having an effect.

780
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:35,660
l can feel them. And...

781
01:34:36,797 --> 01:34:39,169
l don't feel sleepy.

782
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:41,334
But...

783
01:34:44,222 --> 01:34:46,713
They've been a long time.

784
01:34:48,643 --> 01:34:51,513
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

785
01:34:52,272 --> 01:34:55,356
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

786
01:34:55,442 --> 01:34:57,434
ls that the way it works?

787
01:34:57,527 --> 01:34:59,603
Shut up.

788
01:35:00,989 --> 01:35:05,069
l don't think they are coming back.
l think they've been killed.

789
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,733
- l said shut up!
- Hannah...

790
01:35:09,331 --> 01:35:11,407
They're dead.

791
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,951
And you're gonna be next.

792
01:35:21,135 --> 01:35:23,423
- Get up!
- Whoa!

793
01:35:24,013 --> 01:35:27,132
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

794
01:35:27,225 --> 01:35:30,060
Don't worry. l feel fine. Really.

795
01:35:31,354 --> 01:35:33,430
Get him off me!

796
01:35:34,649 --> 01:35:36,937
Get him off me!

797
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,729
lt's Jones! lt's Jones!

798
01:35:52,126 --> 01:35:57,666
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

799
01:35:57,757 --> 01:35:59,833
(screaming)

800
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:09,009
Don'tjust stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

801
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:11,094
You two, in there! Move!

802
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:22,860
(wheezing)

803
01:36:29,415 --> 01:36:31,372
Come on, then!

804
01:36:31,459 --> 01:36:34,413
What the fuck you gonna do now?

805
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:39,416
(screaming)

806
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:57,232
Come on up!

807
01:36:58,153 --> 01:36:59,861

(screaming)

828
01:42:27,372 --> 01:42:29,863
That was longer than a heartbeat.

Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.

835
01:43:11,543 --> 01:43:13,619
But l thought he was biting you.

The gates are locked!
