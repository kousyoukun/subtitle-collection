1
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,930
Bingo!

2
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,980
(chimps screeching)

3
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,114
Fucking hell.

4
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:11,854
(screech)

5
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:14,335
Fucking hell.

6
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:07,169
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

7
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:10,300
lf you wanna get 'em out of here.

8
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,820
- l can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

9
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:30,525
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...

10
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:41,828
l know who you are.
l know what you think...

11
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:45,749
lf you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

12
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,090
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

13
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,661
- lnfected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

14
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:57,702
lnfected with what?

15
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:01,533
Rage.

16
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:06,404
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

17
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:07,835
No! No! No!

18
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:12,836
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

19
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:14,496
We'll get you out of here.

20
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:19,278
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

21
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,838
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

22
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,319
(screaming)

23
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,241
Get it off! Help me!

24
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:38,763
Get it off! Get it off!

25
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:45,584
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

26
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:49,896
(screams) Oh, my God!

27
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:57,458
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

28
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:01,549
Oh, God...

29
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:03,109
(screaming)

30
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:41,989
(sharp intake of breath)

31
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:52,057
Hello?

32
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:10,452
(coughs)

33
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:31,978
Hello?

34
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,153
(louder) Hello!

35
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,251
(belches)

36
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,400
Hello?

37
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,237
Hello!

38
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:00,268
(alarm)

39
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,664
Hello?

40
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,747
Hello?

41
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:12,058
(noises from behind door)

42
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:20,580
(gasping and retching)

43
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,191
Father?

44
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:32,673
Father, are you OK?

45
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:42,716
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

46
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:45,367
Shouldn't have done that.

47
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:47,677
Shit!

48
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,555
(man) Over here!

49
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:21,766
- Over here!
- Come on!

50
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,730
Go, go, go!

51
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,032
Keep going!

52
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:45,992
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

53
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:56,735
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

54
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,303
Let's go! Let's go!

55
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,613
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

56
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,446
Come on!

57
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:02,362
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

58
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:04,453
The giraffe falls over.

59
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:09,754
The man goes to leave and the barman says
''Oi! You can't leave that lying there.''

60
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:13,885
He says ''No, it's not a lion. lt's a giraffe''.

61
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:24,408
He's completely humourless.

62
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:27,409
You two should get on like a house on fire.

63
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:30,980
So who are you?

64
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,111
You're from the hospital.

65
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:37,722
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

66
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:40,112
l'm a bicycle courier.

67
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:48,724
l was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

68
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:52,545
Then l wake up today in hospital.
l wake up and l'm...

69
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:54,546
l'm hallucinating or l'm...

70
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:58,677
What's your name?

71
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,858
Jim.

72
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,198
l'm Mark. This is Selena.

73
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,290
OK, Jim.

74
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,632
l've got some bad news.

75
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:24,984
lt started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

76
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:29,245
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

77
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:32,856
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

78
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:37,677
lt was in the street outside.
lt was coming through your windows.

79
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,598
lt was a virus.

80
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,468
An infection.

81
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,379
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

82
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,900
lt was the blood.

83
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,510
There was something in the blood.

84
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:55,942
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

85
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:58,943
The infection was everywhere.

86
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,513
The army blockades were overrun.

87
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,774
And that's when the exodus started.

88
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,906
The day before broadcasting stopped,

89
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:13,647
there were reports of lnfection
in Paris and New York.

90
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:18,948
We didn't hear anything more after that.

91
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:24,869
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

92
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:27,430
Of course there's a government!

93
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,561
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

94
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:35,952
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

95
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:40,524
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

96
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:45,305
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

97
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:48,226
Where's your family?

98
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:51,176
They're dead. Like Selena's.

99
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:53,397
Yours will be dead too.

100
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,701
Look, l have to find them.
They live in Deptford. l can walk it. OK?

101
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,361
You'll go and come back, yeah?

102
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:14,572
- You won't.
- Yes!

103
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:17,663
No one ever comes back.

104
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:24,275
So lesson one.

105
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:29,576
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

106
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,967
Lesson two.

107
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:36,148
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

108
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:40,239
We'll take you tomorrow.

109
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,930
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

110
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,411
Eat.

111
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,765
lf you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

112
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,332
- lf there's anyone...
- l understand.

113
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,513
- Anyone...
- l understand!

114
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:36,164
OK.

115
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:11,523
(sniffs)

116
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,305
Jim...

117
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:21,476
Wait!

118
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:50,109
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

119
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,589
l'm not grateful.

120
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,850
My...

121
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,072
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

122
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:09,024
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

123
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:12,024
l remember my dad had all this cash,

124
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:15,465
even though cash was completely useless.

125
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:20,117
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

126
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:24,858
Crowd was surging.

127
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:27,989
l lost my grip on my sister's hand.

128
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:32,510
l remember the ground was soft.

129
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,861
l looked down
and l was standing on all these people.

130
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:42,902
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

131
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:46,954
Somewhere in the crowd
there were lnfected. lt spread fast.

132
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:50,384
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

133
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:55,086
Climb over more people.
So l did that. l climbed.

134
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,516
And l got up on top of this kiosk.

135
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:04,778
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

136
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:08,739
Then l saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

137
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,830
My dad.

138
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,181
His face...

139
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:22,783
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

140
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:28,004
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

141
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:33,526
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

142
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:36,967
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. lt's safer.

143
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:53,807
(radio)

144
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:59,338
Jim.

145
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,071
- You're back.
- Yeah.

146
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:18,553
- How was it?
- Fine.

147
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:21,944
Give me a drink of that, will ya?

148
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,074
- lt's empty.
- Ha!

149
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,736
Here.

150
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,907
l'll start working on them, then.

151
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,519
Mark! Mark!

152
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:44,480
Selena! Help!

153
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,874
(Selena) lt's clear.

154
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:09,306
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

155
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:11,617
And his daughter. From four doors down.

156
00:29:11,697 --> 00:29:14,788
- Were you bitten?
- No.

157
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,789
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

158
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:20,699
No.

159
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,571
Mark?

160
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:29,702
Wait...

161
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:34,093
(Mark screams)

162
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:53,798
Get that cleaned off.

163
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,759
Do you have any clothes here?

164
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:00,760
Um... l... Yes.

165
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,501
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

166
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:08,242
More lnfected will be coming.
They always do.

167
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,030
(Jim) How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?

168
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,031
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. lt was on you.

169
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:49,512
l didn't know he was infected.
He knew. l could see it in his face.

170
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:53,984
lf someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

171
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:59,205
lt might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. lt makes no difference.

172
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:04,726
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, l'll do it in a heartbeat.

173
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:09,038
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

174
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:13,559
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

175
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,169
Plans are pointless.

176
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:18,820
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

177
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:22,081
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

178
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,262
What's that?

179
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:32,434
Let's go.

180
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:20,666
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

181
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:23,837
Stop talking. lt's a long way up.

182
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,880
(Selena) Do you need a break?

183
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:39,101
- You?
- No.

184
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:43,842
Now l do need a break.

185
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,145
What's up?

186
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,236
Nothin'.

187
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:01,977
l got a headache.

188
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,547
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

189
00:33:03,627 --> 00:33:08,939
- Why didn't you say something before?
- l didn't think you'd give a shit.

190
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:14,420
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

191
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,591
So you're crashing.

192
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:18,941
There isn't a lot we can do about that

193
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:24,113
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

194
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,503
Pepsi or Lilt?

195
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:29,724
Do you have any Tango?

196
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:32,855
Actually,
l did have a can of Tango somewhere.

197
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:33,985
(screech)

198
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:36,336
Quiet! That's an lnfected.

199
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:48,509
Oh no, they're in. Move!

200
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,161
Wait up, Selena!

201
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:57,081
Wait for me, please!

202
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,302
Please, Selena! Please!

203
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,693
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

204
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,773
- Run!
- Wait!

205
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:07,124
Please! For fuck's sake!

206
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:09,955
- Selena!
- (screams)

207
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:15,036
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

208
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:17,217
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,740
Open the door!

210
00:34:37,312 --> 00:34:38,912
Open the door!

211
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,094
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

212
00:34:46,224 --> 00:34:47,655
What?

213
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:53,266
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

214
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:55,617
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

215
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,839
Go in. Go in!

216
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,491
( ''Frosty the Snowman'")

217
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:26,325
So, l'm Frank, anyway.

218
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:28,185
Jim.

219
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:32,106
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

220
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:34,497
This is my daughter Hannah.

221
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:36,847
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

222
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:40,328
Come on.

223
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:43,059
So...

224
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:45,060
This is great. Just great.

225
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,671
Calls for a celebration, l'd say.

226
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:52,802
Why don't you all sit down and...

227
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:55,852
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

228
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:58,413
We've got Mum's creme de menthe.

229
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:01,244
Great. Creme de menthe.

230
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:04,024
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

231
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:06,595
Get comfortable.

232
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:12,417
- (Frank) Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.

233
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:15,377
Nah, the good ones. lt's a celebration.

234
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,938
Top cupboard.

235
00:36:18,028 --> 00:36:20,769
So this is your place?

236
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:23,770
lt's nice.

237
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:38,033
There.

238
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:41,254
l know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

239
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,075
Cheers.

240
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:59,909
(groans)

241
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,651
You OK in there, Jim?

242
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,952
Yeah.

243
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:15,653
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

244
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:19,564
You'll have to use the bucket.

245
00:37:26,136 --> 00:37:28,747
Have to empty it each morning.

246
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:32,488
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

247
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,268
lt's fine.

248
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:37,489
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

249
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:41,530
We have a spare room.

250
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,881
ln there.

251
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,921
Are you and Selena...?

252
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,012
No. No, no, no.

253
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,752
Um...

254
00:37:50,832 --> 00:37:53,223
l'll take the living room. lt's fine.

255
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,183
Right.

256
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,144
No, l mean, yeah.

257
00:37:59,185 --> 00:38:01,185
So, um...

258
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:05,226
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

259
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,410
Very spruce.

260
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,581
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

261
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,634
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

262
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:37,585
Probably need us more than we need them.

263
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:41,286
l think they're good people.

264
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:47,107
- Good people?
- Yeah.

265
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:53,549
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

266
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,420
- Because if they slowed you down...
- l'd leave them behind.

267
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,420
- ln a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

268
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,771
l wouldn't.

269
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:05,422
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

270
00:39:13,774 --> 00:39:16,245
l'm gonna get some sleep.

271
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,646
Selena...

272
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:24,727
You think l don't get it, but l do get it.

273
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:30,598
And l know l'd be dead already
if l hadn't met you.

274
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,689
Sure.

275
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,339
No, look...

276
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,821
l mean, thank you.

277
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:44,172
And l mean, sure.

278
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:47,043
Goodnight, Jim.

279
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,213
Goodnight.

280
00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:04,867
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

281
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:09,088
l thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

282
00:40:09,178 --> 00:40:12,399
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

283
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,401
You drink it,

284
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,261
it evaporates,

285
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,442
turns stagnant.

286
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,923
They're all empty.

287
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:28,794
Hasn't rained in ten days.

288
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:33,135
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

289
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:36,966
Saw it on TV once, but l can't make it work.

290
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:40,407
You'd never think it.

291
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:44,268
Needing rain so badly.

292
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:48,359
Not in fucking England!

293
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,141
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

294
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:08,844
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

295
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:13,495
(man on radio) Salvation is here.
The answer to lnfection is here.

296
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:16,586
if you can hear this, you're not alone.

297
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:21,197
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.

298
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:23,458
We are soldiers and we are armed.

299
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:26,849
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

300
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:31,500
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,

301
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,021
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

302
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:39,022
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now itjust repeats.

303
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:41,503
- lt's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

304
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:44,503
But this is where it's telling us to go.

305
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:46,724
Just there.

306
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:53,026
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

307
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:54,856
''We''?

308
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:05,029
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.

309
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,250
- Look, l didn't...
- No, it's OK. lt's the truth.

310
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,860
l can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

311
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,901
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. l couldn't risk it.

312
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,692
But with other people...

313
00:42:16,772 --> 00:42:21,083
lf it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

314
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,644
- lt's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to lnfection...

315
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:29,035
There is no answer!
lt's already done all the damage it can!

316
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,956
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

317
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:36,127
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

318
00:42:38,217 --> 00:42:40,518
Or die here.

319
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:46,299
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

320
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,700
We need each other.

321
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:55,042
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

322
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,872
So we have to try and get there.

323
00:42:59,003 --> 00:43:00,573
Get there how?

324
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,747
Just so you know,
l don't take cheques or credit cards.

325
00:43:44,315 --> 00:43:47,315
- (Frank) What do you think?
- lt's the most direct route.

326
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:52,667
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

327
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:55,057
(Frank) Let's just get it done.

328
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,191
(Jim) No, no.

329
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,762
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

330
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:17,023
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.

331
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:21,504
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

332
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:24,505
lt's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

333
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,806
Hold on!

334
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:37,899
Dad!

335
00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:42,030
(screaming and laughing)

336
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:58,864
Fuck!

337
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,555
The world's worst place to get a flat.

338
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:05,996
Agreed. l think we'd better do this quick.

339
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:10,647
l've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

340
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:28,782
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

341
00:45:28,912 --> 00:45:30,952
Hear what?

342
00:45:31,653 --> 00:45:33,913
(Hannah) Right, l've done it.

343
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,004
Dad?

344
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:39,175
(scrabbling sounds)

345
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:43,956
- Jesus Christ!
- (Hannah screaming)

346
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:45,566
Fucking rats!

347
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:58,700
They're running from the lnfected.

348
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,700
Move it!

349
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:05,091
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

350
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:08,442
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

351
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,354
Lift, lift!

352
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:20,015
- (Selena) Don't look at them! Don't look!
- (Jim) l can see them! They're coming!

353
00:46:21,626 --> 00:46:23,706
(screeching)

354
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:28,317
Come on, Hannah!

355
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:30,798
Almost.

356
00:46:30,928 --> 00:46:33,839
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- l'm trying.

357
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,281
Three, two, one,

358
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:43,101
drop it!

359
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:49,673
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

360
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:54,154
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

361
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:59,155
(Jim) Whoo!

362
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:06,027
Goodbye, you fuckers!

363
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:16,290
Frank, stop the cab.

364
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:41,556
Let's shop.

365
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:50,559
(Frank making engine noises)

366
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:53,690
You...

367
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,990
You...

368
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,911
You...

369
00:47:57,991 --> 00:48:00,561
(Jim) Anybody seen any buns?

370
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:03,472
Hmm. lrradiated.

371
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:09,734
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

372
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:11,694
l think you can eat that raw.

373
00:48:11,784 --> 00:48:13,655
Decaffeinated coffee...

374
00:48:13,735 --> 00:48:15,785
Put that back.

375
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:19,256
Can'tjust take any crap.

376
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:23,868
lf l never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

377
00:48:24,258 --> 00:48:26,958
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

378
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:32,180
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

379
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,130
Warm but not aggressive.

380
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,701
- (Hannah and Selena laughing)
- Peaty aftertaste.

381
00:48:40,312 --> 00:48:43,533
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

382
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:41,498
Either we do this now or we're walking.

383
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,590
Not you.

384
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:56,242
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

385
00:49:56,332 --> 00:49:58,412
You heard.

386
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,080
Where are you going?

387
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,561
We've got enough food, Jim.

388
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:32,991
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

389
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:36,422
(quietly) Like going on holidays
with your aunt!

390
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:18,093
Oh, Jesus.

391
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,440
Hello?

392
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:01,014
l hate you!

393
00:52:10,187 --> 00:52:12,277
Find anything?

394
00:52:14,538 --> 00:52:17,318
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

395
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:19,499
OK, we're done here.

396
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,590
OK, Hannah.

397
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,632
Easy. Brake!

398
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:34,803
Brake, brake!

399
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:44,726
Out.

400
00:53:29,337 --> 00:53:32,518
(Selena) Mmmm! Oh my God!

401
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:36,299
l can, like, taste the vitamin C.

402
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:39,910
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

403
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,211
What did you say?

404
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:46,082
The raisins. They're so moist.

405
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:52,913
Look over here.

406
00:54:04,266 --> 00:54:06,087
Like a family.

407
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:08,617
(Hannah) Do you think they're infected?

408
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:11,138
(Frank) No.

409
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:17,310
They're doing just fine.

410
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,142
Come on. Let's eat!

411
00:54:39,836 --> 00:54:41,146
Know what l was thinking?

412
00:54:41,226 --> 00:54:44,927
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

413
00:54:45,017 --> 00:54:49,188
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

414
00:54:50,228 --> 00:54:54,059
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

415
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,841
Um.... that's what you were thinking.

416
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,802
No.

417
00:55:05,062 --> 00:55:07,323
l was thinking l was wrong.

418
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,674
About what?

419
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:14,455
All the death.

420
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:17,155
All this shit.

421
00:55:18,766 --> 00:55:23,287
lt doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

422
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:28,108
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

423
00:55:28,198 --> 00:55:30,329
Cheeky monkey!

424
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:34,420
l was wrong when l said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

425
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:40,551
See, that's what l was thinking.

426
00:55:41,032 --> 00:55:42,722
Was it?

427
00:55:42,812 --> 00:55:45,073
Mm. You stole my thought.

428
00:55:50,294 --> 00:55:52,164
Sorry.

429
00:55:53,165 --> 00:55:55,035
That's OK.

430
00:55:55,115 --> 00:55:57,166
You can keep it.

431
00:55:58,336 --> 00:56:02,297
lt's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

432
00:56:17,381 --> 00:56:19,912
l can't sleep.

433
00:56:19,992 --> 00:56:22,652
Me neither.

434
00:56:22,732 --> 00:56:25,083
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

435
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,254
Outside like this.

436
00:56:28,124 --> 00:56:30,564
l think we're safe enough.

437
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:33,305
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

438
00:56:33,995 --> 00:56:36,516
Yeah, l noticed that.

439
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:38,086
Hey, Selena...

440
00:56:38,176 --> 00:56:40,257
What? What is it?

441
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,658
How'd you get to sleep?

442
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,001
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

443
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:58,392
l didn't need a prescription.
l qualified as a chemist.

444
00:56:58,442 --> 00:57:01,002
Oh, great. Valium.

445
00:57:01,092 --> 00:57:03,663
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

446
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:07,444
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

447
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:09,795
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

448
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,925
Can l, Dad?

449
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:14,006
l don't think so, sweetheart.

450
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:15,576
Please?

451
00:57:17,097 --> 00:57:19,187
- No.
- l can't sleep.

452
00:57:22,268 --> 00:57:24,969
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

453
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:30,060
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

454
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:42,713
Night-night.

455
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:46,144
You're a big softie, Frank.

456
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:18,723
Frank?

457
00:58:18,813 --> 00:58:20,853
Hannah?

458
00:58:20,943 --> 00:58:22,854
Frank?

459
00:58:28,465 --> 00:58:30,546
Hello? Hello!

460
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:32,856
Hello!

461
00:58:32,946 --> 00:58:35,417
Hello! Hello!

462
00:58:40,378 --> 00:58:42,469
(mumbles)

463
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:45,600
Shh...

464
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,771
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

465
00:58:52,512 --> 00:58:54,602
Thanks, Dad.

466
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,611
(car horn)

467
00:59:29,911 --> 00:59:32,482
Come on, sleepyhead.

468
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,223
Come on, Babe Ruth.

469
00:59:41,434 --> 00:59:43,355
(Frank) Hurry up.

470
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:48,566
- Did l miss breakfast?
- (Selena) You'll sleep through anything.

471
00:59:48,656 --> 00:59:53,657
- (Jim) Did you have a fry-up?
- (Frank) We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!

472
01:00:18,234 --> 01:00:22,755
(radio) Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,

473
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:25,926
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

474
01:00:26,016 --> 01:00:27,926
You must find us. Please!

475
01:00:28,016 --> 01:00:30,147
Salvation is here.

476
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:33,238
The answer to lnfection is here.

477
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,377
Must be Manchester.

478
01:01:09,587 --> 01:01:12,938
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

479
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:17,119
No fire crews to put it out.

480
01:02:11,954 --> 01:02:14,524
42nd blockade.

481
01:02:14,604 --> 01:02:16,955
This is it.

482
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:32,104
l don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

483
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:35,325
- l don't like this. l think we should go.
- No!

484
01:03:42,157 --> 01:03:46,978
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

485
01:04:05,163 --> 01:04:07,034
Nothing.

486
01:04:07,164 --> 01:04:09,034
l can't believe it.

487
01:04:09,164 --> 01:04:11,115
Frank...

488
01:04:11,555 --> 01:04:13,425
Frank!

489
01:04:15,636 --> 01:04:17,296
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

490
01:04:17,426 --> 01:04:19,907
Go fucking where?!

491
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,956
(cawing)

492
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:01,178
Get out of it.

493
01:05:04,699 --> 01:05:06,789
Get out of it!

494
01:05:24,614 --> 01:05:27,184
Dad, are you all right?

495
01:05:27,264 --> 01:05:29,925
Yeah, l'm fine, sweetheart.

496
01:05:30,835 --> 01:05:33,576
Sorry l lost my temper.

497
01:05:33,656 --> 01:05:35,747
Hannah...

498
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:38,798
l love you very much.

499
01:05:38,878 --> 01:05:40,878
- What?
- Keep away from me.

500
01:05:40,968 --> 01:05:43,319
Stay where you are.

501
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:46,319
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

502
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:48,880
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

503
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:52,101
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

504
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:56,362
(Hannah) What's wrong? Dad!

505
01:06:00,663 --> 01:06:03,064
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

506
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:05,805
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

507
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:09,325
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

508
01:06:09,405 --> 01:06:10,666
Kill him!

509
01:06:19,148 --> 01:06:21,459
Stay away from him!

510
01:06:22,669 --> 01:06:25,110
Keep away from the body!

511
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,761
Dad?

512
01:06:52,157 --> 01:06:54,817
(man) Three survivors. One male, two female.

513
01:06:54,897 --> 01:06:58,248
l repeat, one male, two female.

514
01:06:58,338 --> 01:07:00,899
ETA, 15.

515
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:03,420
Put the kettle on.

516
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:53,913
l'm Major Henry West.

517
01:07:55,173 --> 01:07:56,874
- Welcome.
- Jim.

518
01:07:56,964 --> 01:07:58,964
Hello, Jim.

519
01:07:59,044 --> 01:08:00,785
Hello.

520
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:07,916
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

521
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:10,397
So you can all have a shower.

522
01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:13,838
You look like you need one. Please.

523
01:08:33,793 --> 01:08:39,015
lt ain't funny. l got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

524
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:42,185
Run him over!

525
01:08:44,926 --> 01:08:47,707
(Jim) How is she doing?

526
01:08:47,797 --> 01:08:50,978
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

527
01:08:53,628 --> 01:08:56,149
lt's all fucked.

528
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,240
What do you mean?

529
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:06,852
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

530
01:09:06,932 --> 01:09:09,022
Hey, don't do that.

531
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:15,674
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like l'll cope.

532
01:09:15,804 --> 01:09:19,715
- Just like you'll cope.
- l don't want her to have to fucking cope.

533
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:23,416
l want her to be OK.

534
01:09:24,987 --> 01:09:27,157
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

535
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:30,028
lt was OK for them and it was OK for us.

536
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:35,809
Now it's all just fucked.

537
01:10:07,258 --> 01:10:10,078
So you heard our broadcast?

538
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:13,689
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

539
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:19,871
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

540
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:26,473
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to lnfection.

541
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:30,914
Yeah.

542
01:10:31,004 --> 01:10:35,475
As l said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

543
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,786
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

544
01:10:38,876 --> 01:10:42,007
The fire drove hundreds of lnfected
out of Manchester.

545
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:45,177
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

546
01:10:46,918 --> 01:10:49,529
But don't worry.

547
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:52,139
You're quite safe here.

548
01:10:55,220 --> 01:11:01,092
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

549
01:11:02,442 --> 01:11:05,003
High perimeter wall which helps.

550
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:09,354
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

551
01:11:09,444 --> 01:11:14,095
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

552
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:22,267
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

553
01:11:22,397 --> 01:11:24,788
The belly of the house. The heart.

554
01:11:24,878 --> 01:11:30,139
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

555
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:32,320
The kitchen.

556
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,530
Here you are. l'll swap you.

557
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:37,791
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

558
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:41,922
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

559
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:44,403
Jones, our resident tin opener.

560
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:47,494
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

561
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:50,194
l can't wait.

562
01:11:57,716 --> 01:11:59,927
And lastly, meet Mailer.

563
01:12:03,758 --> 01:12:05,718
Mailer, Jim.

564
01:12:05,798 --> 01:12:07,929
Jim, Mailer.

565
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:11,800
Got infected two days ago.

566
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:16,981
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

567
01:12:21,593 --> 01:12:23,673
Keeping him alive?

568
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:28,674
The idea was to learn something
about lnfection.

569
01:12:30,025 --> 01:12:32,115
Have him teach me.

570
01:12:38,807 --> 01:12:40,858
And has he?

571
01:12:43,028 --> 01:12:45,209
ln a way.

572
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,811
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

573
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:57,032
Farm crops,

574
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:59,813
raise livestock.

575
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,293
He's telling me he's futureless.

576
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:11,816
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the lnfected take to starve to death.

577
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:48,135
(singing)

578
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:54,047
You'll have to wait and see

579
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:56,357
Hope it's chips, it's chips

580
01:13:56,437 --> 01:13:59,008
We hope it's chips, it's chips

581
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:02,529
(cheering)

582
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:10,011
Hat.

583
01:14:10,091 --> 01:14:12,572
So, what have we here?

584
01:14:15,442 --> 01:14:18,793
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

585
01:14:23,574 --> 01:14:26,315
- (man) Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!

586
01:14:26,405 --> 01:14:28,836
- lt's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

587
01:14:28,926 --> 01:14:32,147
Absolutely. l was going to propose a toast

588
01:14:32,237 --> 01:14:35,367
but this omelette will do just as well.

589
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:40,449
- To new friends.
- (all) New friends.

590
01:14:50,932 --> 01:14:54,843
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

591
01:14:54,933 --> 01:14:58,323
l thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

592
01:14:58,414 --> 01:15:00,324
Get rid of it.

593
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:05,245
(man) Doris, you twat.

594
01:15:05,325 --> 01:15:08,106
l don't suppose you can cook, can you?

595
01:15:08,936 --> 01:15:14,418
l can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

596
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:19,029
What a fucking disappointment.
l saw those eggs, l thought it was Christmas.

597
01:15:19,109 --> 01:15:22,380
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

598
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,291
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

599
01:15:25,381 --> 01:15:29,422
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

600
01:15:29,512 --> 01:15:33,813
- You don't know nothing.
- l think Bill's got a point.

601
01:15:33,943 --> 01:15:37,034
lf you look at the whole life of the planet,

602
01:15:37,114 --> 01:15:39,034
we...

603
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:43,255
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

604
01:15:44,035 --> 01:15:46,466
So if the infection wipes us all out,

605
01:15:47,466 --> 01:15:49,777
that is a return to normality.

606
01:15:53,778 --> 01:15:56,779
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

607
01:15:56,859 --> 01:16:00,120
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

608
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,910
Our spiritual guru.

609
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:08,212
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

610
01:16:10,992 --> 01:16:15,124
This is what l've seen
in the four weeks since lnfection.

611
01:16:15,214 --> 01:16:17,824
People killing people.

612
01:16:17,914 --> 01:16:22,475
Which is what l saw in the four weeks before
lnfection, the four weeks before that...

613
01:16:22,565 --> 01:16:27,997
As far back as l care to remember,
people killing people.

614
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:31,738
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

615
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:43,001
- You're not eating?
- l don't want to eat.

616
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:45,872
You must eat, Hannah.

617
01:16:45,962 --> 01:16:49,222
l don't want to eat.
l want to bury my dad.

618
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:53,223
He's one of the people you're talking about.

619
01:16:56,054 --> 01:16:57,224
(explosion)

620
01:16:57,355 --> 01:16:59,405
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

621
01:17:00,095 --> 01:17:02,406
Move!

622
01:17:02,536 --> 01:17:04,796
Move! Move! Move!

623
01:17:06,577 --> 01:17:08,878
(siren)

624
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:15,749
Enemy in front!

625
01:17:48,588 --> 01:17:51,109
Mick, l fucking got one!

626
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,810
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

627
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:09,723
Fucking hell! He bounced!

628
01:18:09,813 --> 01:18:11,424
Cease fire!

629
01:18:11,504 --> 01:18:13,764
l ain't never seen that in my life!

630
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:16,555
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!

631
01:18:16,635 --> 01:18:18,336
- Clear.
- Clear.

632
01:18:18,426 --> 01:18:19,556
Yeah, yeah, clear.

633
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,209
Oh, hello!

634
01:18:32,299 --> 01:18:34,380
(woif whistle)

635
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:42,082
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

636
01:18:42,162 --> 01:18:44,342
Cos you got me to protect you now.

637
01:18:46,163 --> 01:18:51,434
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

638
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:52,995
Fuck you!

639
01:18:53,085 --> 01:18:55,255
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

640
01:18:55,345 --> 01:18:57,346
How about right now?

641
01:18:57,996 --> 01:18:59,866
Mitchell!

642
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:05,958
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

643
01:19:07,258 --> 01:19:09,869
Sergeant Farrell!

644
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,741
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

645
01:19:16,831 --> 01:19:20,262
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

646
01:19:22,482 --> 01:19:24,573
Slow down.

647
01:19:27,704 --> 01:19:30,655
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

648
01:19:30,745 --> 01:19:33,445
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

649
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,917
The rest of you, go with him.

650
01:19:46,099 --> 01:19:48,179
My apologies.

651
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,661
Drink?

652
01:19:58,582 --> 01:20:01,233
Look, we're grateful, OK?

653
01:20:01,323 --> 01:20:05,534
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

654
01:20:05,624 --> 01:20:07,144
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

655
01:20:07,234 --> 01:20:12,405
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

656
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:22,798
l killed... l killed a boy.

657
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:29,190
A child?

658
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:32,671
Yes.

659
01:20:34,461 --> 01:20:39,242
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

660
01:20:42,763 --> 01:20:44,634
Survival.

661
01:20:48,065 --> 01:20:50,155
l understand.

662
01:20:52,546 --> 01:20:55,027
l promised them women.

663
01:20:56,987 --> 01:20:59,068
What?

664
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:03,989
Eight days ago l found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

665
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:09,900
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

666
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,861
What could l say to him?

667
01:21:12,941 --> 01:21:18,123
We fight off the lnfected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

668
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:22,904
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

669
01:21:22,994 --> 01:21:29,125
l moved us from the blockade, l set the radio
broadcasting and l promised them women.

670
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:35,817
Because women mean a future.

671
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:45,910
Selena! Hannah!

672
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,480
- What is it?
- We have to go.

673
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:50,611
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

674
01:21:53,612 --> 01:21:55,652
Come on!

675
01:21:56,783 --> 01:21:58,743
We get in the car and we go!

676
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:04,655
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

677
01:22:04,745 --> 01:22:08,006
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

678
01:22:08,086 --> 01:22:10,786
l'm not gonna let you keep them here!

679
01:22:10,876 --> 01:22:12,787
You can't do this!

680
01:22:15,357 --> 01:22:17,658
Right, get him!

681
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,051
l want to give you a chance.

682
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:29,271
You can be with us.

683
01:22:30,882 --> 01:22:33,182
But l can't let them go.

684
01:22:38,794 --> 01:22:41,404
OK, Jim? OK.

685
01:22:46,056 --> 01:22:48,146
Him too.

686
01:23:01,229 --> 01:23:04,020
(Farrell) Smithers says
''Women and semen don't mix.''

687
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,021
And Mr Burns says
''We all know what you think, Smithers.''

688
01:23:07,101 --> 01:23:10,022
And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.

689
01:23:10,102 --> 01:23:13,713
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

690
01:23:13,803 --> 01:23:18,234
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!

691
01:23:18,324 --> 01:23:21,585
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

692
01:23:21,675 --> 01:23:27,376
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!

693
01:23:28,457 --> 01:23:32,508
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

694
01:23:33,848 --> 01:23:36,979
Just imagine, just think about it.

695
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:40,330
How could lnfection cross the oceans?

696
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:44,721
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? lt can be stopped.

697
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:47,512
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

698
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:51,593
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

699
01:23:51,683 --> 01:23:55,033
Think! Actually think about it.

700
01:23:55,904 --> 01:23:59,465
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

701
01:24:03,646 --> 01:24:05,726
They quarantined us.

702
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:12,598
''There is no lnfection.
lt's just people killing people.'' He's insane!

703
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:23,861
Time to go.

704
01:24:25,251 --> 01:24:27,342
Quarantine?

705
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:02,261
- Please...
- Believe me, l'm not interested.

706
01:25:03,351 --> 01:25:08,483
You see, l'm gonna have the black one.
And l'm gonna make her squirm.

707
01:25:08,573 --> 01:25:12,484
Mitchell, l swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

708
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,314
Move.

709
01:25:14,404 --> 01:25:16,265
Come on, move! Get up!

710
01:25:16,355 --> 01:25:18,405
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

711
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:20,056
Get up!

712
01:25:20,136 --> 01:25:22,406
Move your fucking arse!

713
01:25:43,412 --> 01:25:46,843
(Farrell) Come on then,
you fucking pansies. Do me first.

714
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:49,413
(Jones) No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.

715
01:25:49,493 --> 01:25:52,544
- (Farrell) So you're gonna stick me?
- (Jones) Shoot 'em!

716
01:25:52,624 --> 01:25:55,275
- (Mitchell) Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!

717
01:25:55,365 --> 01:25:58,416
(Farrell) ls that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

718
01:25:58,496 --> 01:26:00,416
- l'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

719
01:26:00,496 --> 01:26:03,977
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

720
01:26:07,588 --> 01:26:09,459
l'm gonna enjoy this.

721
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,241
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

722
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:21,502
- You wanna shoot me? l'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

723
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:25,593
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

724
01:26:28,073 --> 01:26:31,284
- Jones, move it!
- l can see him! l can see him!

725
01:26:31,374 --> 01:26:33,465
Where are you?

726
01:26:41,077 --> 01:26:42,947
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

727
01:26:43,077 --> 01:26:45,118
(gunfire)

728
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:54,210
Oh no. We're fucked.

729
01:26:55,381 --> 01:26:56,901
We're fucked!

730
01:26:56,991 --> 01:26:58,381
Relax.

731
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:01,902
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

732
01:27:01,992 --> 01:27:04,733
And no shooter.

733
01:27:04,823 --> 01:27:06,163
He's dead.

734
01:27:06,253 --> 01:27:08,344
(thunder)

735
01:27:40,962 --> 01:27:44,913
(West) The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.

736
01:27:45,003 --> 01:27:48,574
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

737
01:27:48,654 --> 01:27:51,225
which she certainly has no use for.

738
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,046
You can't do it to Hannah.

739
01:27:54,136 --> 01:27:57,837
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

740
01:27:57,917 --> 01:28:00,007
Yes, sir.

741
01:28:03,398 --> 01:28:05,449
(Hannah) No...

742
01:28:06,529 --> 01:28:08,580
(man) Ladies...

743
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,141
- lt's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

744
01:28:14,231 --> 01:28:17,582
- l thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

745
01:28:17,662 --> 01:28:19,272
(Hannah) Selena!

746
01:28:19,362 --> 01:28:21,453
Whoa, whoa, relax!

747
01:28:22,533 --> 01:28:24,104
Selena!

748
01:28:31,846 --> 01:28:34,276
Selena! Selena!

749
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:40,458
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

750
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:46,059
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

751
01:28:46,149 --> 01:28:50,281
lf you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

752
01:29:01,283 --> 01:29:03,634
lt's just polite.

753
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:12,156
Yeah, all right.

754
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:13,987
All right.

755
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:16,937
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

756
01:29:40,034 --> 01:29:43,995
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.

757
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:46,205
Are you trying to kill me?

758
01:29:46,385 --> 01:29:48,556
No, sweetheart.

759
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:51,206
l'm making you not care. OK?

760
01:29:52,517 --> 01:29:54,737
What you doing?!

761
01:29:57,168 --> 01:29:59,209
(siren)

762
01:29:59,299 --> 01:30:01,779
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

763
01:30:01,869 --> 01:30:03,080
Move!

764
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:05,820
Stay here and put the dresses on.

765
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:07,481
Let's go! Go!

766
01:30:11,692 --> 01:30:14,262
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

767
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:17,043
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

768
01:32:25,557 --> 01:32:27,647
Davis?

769
01:33:00,256 --> 01:33:02,256
(engine fails)

770
01:33:02,346 --> 01:33:04,177
Fuck it!

771
01:33:13,349 --> 01:33:15,180
(gunfire)

772
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:59,061
- What was that?
- Lightning.

773
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:02,062
l heard something.

774
01:34:04,322 --> 01:34:06,803
lt sounded like a Claymore to me.

775
01:34:07,843 --> 01:34:11,804
All right, l'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

776
01:34:12,585 --> 01:34:14,455
Girls,

777
01:34:14,545 --> 01:34:17,196
keep an eye on him, will ya?

778
01:34:27,849 --> 01:34:30,279
Those pills,

779
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:32,850
l think they're having an effect.

780
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:35,461
l can feel them. And...

781
01:34:36,591 --> 01:34:38,941
l don't feel sleepy.

782
01:34:39,022 --> 01:34:41,112
But...

783
01:34:43,983 --> 01:34:46,503
They've been a long time.

784
01:34:48,414 --> 01:34:51,285
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

785
01:34:52,025 --> 01:34:55,116
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

786
01:34:55,206 --> 01:34:57,206
ls that the way it works?

787
01:34:57,286 --> 01:34:59,377
Shut up.

788
01:35:00,767 --> 01:35:04,858
l don't think they are coming back.
l think they've been killed.

789
01:35:04,948 --> 01:35:07,509
- l said shut up!
- Hannah...

790
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:11,160
They're dead.

791
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,731
And you're gonna be next.

792
01:35:20,902 --> 01:35:23,213
- Get up!
- Whoa!

793
01:35:23,773 --> 01:35:26,904
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

794
01:35:26,994 --> 01:35:29,825
Don't worry. l feel fine. Really.

795
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,216
Get him off me!

796
01:35:34,426 --> 01:35:36,697
Get him off me!

797
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:40,518
lt's Jones! lt's Jones!

798
01:35:51,911 --> 01:35:57,432
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

799
01:35:57,522 --> 01:35:59,613
(screaming)

800
01:36:05,394 --> 01:36:08,785
Don'tjust stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

801
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:10,875
You two, in there! Move!

802
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:22,619
(wheezing)

803
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:31,141
Come on, then!

804
01:36:31,231 --> 01:36:34,182
What the fuck you gonna do now?

805
01:36:37,102 --> 01:36:39,183
(screaming)

806
01:36:54,887 --> 01:36:57,018
Come on up!

807
01:36:57,928 --> 01:36:59,628
