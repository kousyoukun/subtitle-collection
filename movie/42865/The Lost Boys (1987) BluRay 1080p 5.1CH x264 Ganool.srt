1
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,536
I told you to stay off the boardwalk.

2
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,584
Okay, boys, let's go.

3
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:59,513
You, too, off the boardwalk.

4
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,051
Keep going.

5
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,886
Hey, I liked that song.

6
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:22,846
Keep going, Mom.

7
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:24,890
- How about this?
- Hang on.

8
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:27,476
I don't see any bogeymen or nasty guys.

9
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:33,440
Keep going. You want to switch the band?

10
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:49,122
- Keep going!
- Wait. That's from my era!

11
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:59,049
We're almost there.

12
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,926
What's that smell?

13
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,886
That's the ocean air.

14
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,763
Smells like someone died.

15
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,058
Guys, I know the last year
hasn't been easy, but...

16
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,645
...I think you're really going to like
living in Santa Carla.

17
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:56,314
There's an amusement park
right on the beach.

18
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,067
Sam, tell those kids
to get something to eat.

19
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,194
Any jobs around here?

20
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:02,779
Nothing legal.

21
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,165
Come on, Nanook.

22
00:06:58,895 --> 00:06:59,896
Dad?

23
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,856
Dad?

24
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:03,441
Looks like he's dead.

25
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,443
No, he's just a deep sleeper.

26
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:08,154
If he's dead, can we go back to Phoenix?

27
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,198
Playing dead...

28
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,618
...and from what I heard,
doing a damn good job of it, too.

29
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:24,587
This is a pretty cool place.

30
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,798
For The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

31
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,883
Come on, Sam, give Mom a break.

32
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,302
What's wrong with this picture?

33
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:35,557
There's no TV. Have you seen a TV?
I haven't seen a TV.

34
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:38,768
You know what it means
when there's no TV? No MTV.

35
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:40,854
Sammy, we are flat broke.

36
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:47,068
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew...

37
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:50,363
...who didn't improve her situation
by getting divorced.

38
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,031
I know.

39
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:56,744
But a big legal war wasn't going
to improve anybody's situation.

40
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,789
We've all been through enough.

41
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,834
Anyway, I was raised better than that.

42
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,794
Ouch, my hair.

43
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,007
Mom, you gotta help me.

44
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,136
Hey, guys, no running in the house!

45
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:23,938
Talk about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

46
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,774
Rules!

47
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:30,111
We've got some rules around here.

48
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:32,655
Second shelf is mine.

49
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:36,784
That's where I keep my root beers
and my double-thick Oreo cookies.

50
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,038
Nobody touches the second shelf, but me.

51
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:44,709
There's another rule around here,
and I want you to pay close attention.

52
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,794
Don't touch anything.

53
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,880
Everything is exactly where I want it.

54
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:49,964
Grandpa...

55
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:53,718
...is it true that Santa Carla's
the murder capital of the world?

56
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,346
There are some bad elements around here.

57
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,056
Wait, let me get this straight.

58
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,850
You're telling me we've moved
to the murder capital of the world?

59
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,268
Are you serious, Grandpa?

60
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:04,062
Well, let me put it this way.

61
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:08,066
If all the corpses buried around here
were to stand up all at once...

62
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,860
...we'd have one hell
of a population problem.

63
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,529
Great, Dad.

64
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,365
Now, on Wednesdays...

65
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,909
...when the mailman brings the TV Guide...

66
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:21,287
...sometimes the address label
is curled up just a little.

67
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:23,957
You'll be tempted to tear it off. Don't.

68
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:27,961
You'll only wind up rippin' the cover
and I don't like that.

69
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,671
And stay outta here.

70
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,590
- You have a TV?
- No.

71
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,009
I just like to read the TV Guide.

72
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:38,054
If you read the TV Guide,
you don't need a TV.

73
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:55,149
I can't find my mom.

74
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,653
What's the matter?

75
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,157
Are you lost?

76
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,751
Let's ask in here.

77
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,962
Excuse me, I wonder if you could help us.

78
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:19,298
This boy is lost and we're wondering
if his mother might be in here.

79
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:20,883
I don't really know.

80
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:24,345
I was so worried!

81
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:26,389
Don't run off like that.

82
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:27,431
There you are.

83
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:28,766
Thank you.

84
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,268
Bye, Terry.

85
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,354
We only come here to watch one thing.

86
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:36,357
Well done.

87
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,566
No, thanks.

88
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,986
Well, on second thought...

89
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,739
I told you not to come in here anymore.

90
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,042
Wild kids.

91
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:58,379
Oh, they're just young.
We were that age, too, once.

92
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,427
Only they dress better. Bye-bye.

93
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,555
You have a generous nature.
I like that in a person.

94
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,099
- My name is Max.
- I'm Lucy.

95
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,811
- That's my dog, Thorn.
- Hi, Thorn.

96
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,979
Say "hello," Thorn.

97
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,939
So how may I help you this evening?

98
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:18,065
We have it all.

99
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,317
The best selection of video tapes
in Santa Carla.

100
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:23,029
No, I'm not looking for a tape.

101
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,947
What I need is...

102
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,282
A job?

103
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:27,575
...a job.

104
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:29,744
Yeah. I look that needy, huh?

105
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,545
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

106
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,172
So what's the rush?

107
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,174
You're chasing that girl, aren't you?

108
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,509
Come on, admit it. You're chasing her.

109
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,511
I'm at the mercy of your sex glands.

110
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:51,515
Don't you have something better to do
than follow me around all night?

111
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,102
Actually, I do.

112
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,766
Got a problem guys?

113
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:36,727
Just scoping your civilian wardrobe.

114
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:38,395
Pretty cool, huh?

115
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,606
For a fashion victim.

116
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:44,109
If you're looking for
the diet frozen-yogurt bar...

117
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:46,403
...it went out of business last summer.

118
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,198
Actually, I'm looking for Batman, no. 14.

119
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,908
That's a very serious book, man.

120
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,535
Only five in existence.

121
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:53,953
Four, actually.

122
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:57,164
I'm always lookin' out for the other three.

123
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,461
You can't put the Superman, no. 77
with the 200s.

124
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,713
They haven't even discovered
red kryptonite yet.

125
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:08,509
And you can't put the no. 98 with the 300s.

126
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,303
Lori Lemaris hasn't even been introduced.

127
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:13,556
Where the hell are you from? Krypton?

128
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,140
Phoenix, actually.

129
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,434
But, lucky me, we moved...

130
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,520
...here.

131
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:25,276
Take this.

132
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,405
I don't like horror comics.

133
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,657
You'll like this one, Mr. Phoenix.

134
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,118
It could save your life.

135
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,620
Come on, she stiffed ya.

136
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,106
- What was that?
- What was what?

137
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,692
- I thought I heard something.
- Forget it.

138
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:13,217
- How do you like that baby?
- It's a beauty.

139
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,885
Come on, let's get in.

140
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,679
Can I drive on the way back?

141
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:20,766
Fat chance.
Nobody drives this baby, but me.

142
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:34,988
We have to let it warm up a little.

143
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:38,158
Hear that sound?
Just like a baby pussycat.

144
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,703
Okay, let's go to town.

145
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,002
Are we having fun, or what?

146
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:50,754
I thought we were going to town.

147
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,674
That's as close to town as I like to get.

148
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,384
Total weirdo, man.

149
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:20,784
Noticed anything unusual
about Santa Carla yet?

150
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:22,828
No, it's a pretty cool place.

151
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,415
- If you're a Martian.
- Or a vampire.

152
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,002
Are you sniffing old newsprint
or something?

153
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,504
You think you really know
what's happening here.

154
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:35,924
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.

155
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,595
You think we just work in
a comic bookstore for our folks?

156
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,722
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.

157
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,557
This is just our cover.

158
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:46,727
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.

159
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,979
We're fighters for "Truth...

160
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,232
"... Justice, and the American way. "

161
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,026
All right.

162
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,281
Read this.

163
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,576
I told you I don't like horror comics.

164
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,329
Think of it more as a survival manual.

165
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:07,664
There's our number on the back...

166
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,208
...and pray you never need to call us.

167
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,669
I'll pray...

168
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:15,339
...I never need to call you.

169
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,840
Sure.

170
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:31,521
It look's great. Definitely. Enjoy it.

171
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:33,315
Thanks.

172
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:41,990
Excuse me.

173
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:44,910
It won't hurt.

174
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:50,332
It's a rip-off.

175
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:55,670
Hi.

176
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,508
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.

177
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:02,385
What's your name?

178
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:03,678
Star.

179
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,555
Oh, your folks, too, huh?

180
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,058
- What do you mean?
- Ex-hippies.

181
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:11,478
I came this close to being called
Moon Beam or Moon Child.

182
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:13,438
Or something like that.

183
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,858
But Star's great. I like Star.

184
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:18,401
Me, too.

185
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:20,612
I'm Michael.

186
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,490
Michael's great. I like Michael.

187
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:27,911
Want to get something to eat?

188
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,162
Okay.

189
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,841
Where are you going, Star?

190
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:43,510
For a ride. This is Michael.

191
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:46,137
Let's go.

192
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:47,264
Star?

193
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:06,408
You know where Hudson's Bluff is,
overlooking the point?

194
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,869
I can't beat your bike.

195
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,121
You don't have to beat me, Michael.

196
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,373
You just have to try and keep up.

197
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,252
We're going for a ride.

198
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,343
Come on!

199
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,980
Come on, Michael!

200
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,335
- What the hell are you doing?
- No!

201
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,506
Just you! Come on!

202
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,299
Just you!

203
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,178
Come on, just you.

204
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:36,683
How far are you willing to go, Michael?

205
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:53,533
Hit the rock box, buddy.

206
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,959
Not bad, huh?

207
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:07,672
This was the hottest resort in Santa Carla
about 85 years ago.

208
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:10,550
Too bad they built it on a fault.

209
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:13,386
In 1906...

210
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,556
...when the big one hit San Francisco...

211
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:20,101
...the ground opened up,
and this place took a header...

212
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:21,895
...right into the crack.

213
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,232
Now it's ours.

214
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,359
So, check it out, Mikey.

215
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,403
Marko...

216
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:32,155
Food.

217
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:36,117
That's what I love about this place.

218
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,119
You ask, and then you get.

219
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,709
Appetizer?

220
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:51,257
You'll like it here, Michael.

221
00:24:54,802 --> 00:24:56,554
Ten o'clock. Lights out.

222
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:58,556
Did you brush your teeth?

223
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,974
Okay, 'night, sweetheart.

224
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:01,142
Mom?

225
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,647
Sorry.

226
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:09,609
I can never sleep
with the closet door open, either.

227
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,194
Not even a crack.

228
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:15,615
Sam, this is a terrible thing to admit,
but I think that...

229
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:19,452
...one of the reasons
I divorced your father...

230
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:23,039
...was because he never believed
in the closet monster.

231
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:30,171
Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!

232
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:33,466
Brought you somethin'
to dress up your room with, Sam.

233
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:35,885
How do you like that?

234
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,011
Thanks, Grandpa.

235
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:39,722
Oh, Dad, really! You shouldn't have!

236
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,683
Lots more where he came from.

237
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,144
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Grandpa.

238
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:48,564
Lights, Sam.

239
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,983
As soon as I finish this comic, okay?

240
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,459
You're history, buddy.

241
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,514
Feeding time. Come and get it, boys.

242
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:27,186
Chinese. Good choice.

243
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,148
Over here, bud.

244
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:32,984
Guests first.

245
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:35,778
You don't like rice?

246
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:39,532
Tell me, Michael, how could
a billion Chinese people be wrong?

247
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:42,827
Come on.

248
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,005
How are those maggots?

249
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,966
Maggots, Michael.

250
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,552
You're eating maggots.
How do they taste?

251
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,269
Leave him alone.

252
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:23,534
Sorry about that.

253
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,578
No hard feelings, huh?

254
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,584
Why don't you try some noodles?

255
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:36,714
- They're worms.
- What do you mean, worms?

256
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:39,926
Don't eat-

257
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:44,889
They're only noodles, Michael.

258
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,187
That's enough.

259
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,565
Drink some of this, Michael.

260
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:40,152
Be one of us.

261
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:00,673
Don't! You don't have to, Michael.

262
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:07,221
It's blood.

263
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:10,266
Yeah, sure.

264
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,270
Bravo!

265
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,193
You were right, Marko.

266
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,035
You're one of us, bud.

267
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,811
Perfect timing.

268
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:41,899
What's going on?

269
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:46,528
Michael wants to know "what's going on. "

270
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,198
Marko?

271
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,367
"What's going on?"

272
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:52,826
I don't know.

273
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,536
"What's going on," Paul?

274
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,206
- Who wants to know?
- Michael wants to know.

275
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,752
I think we should let Michael know
"what's going on. "

276
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,632
Marko...

277
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:08,467
Good night, Michael.

278
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,885
Bombs away.

279
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,930
Bottoms up, man.

280
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:21,772
Come with us, Michael.

281
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,244
Michael Emerson...

282
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,871
Come on down.

283
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,346
Welcome aboard, Michael.

284
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,432
Fun, huh?

285
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,698
Hold on!

286
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:28,338
Don't be scared, Michael!

287
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,016
Michael, you're one of us. Let go!

288
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:40,976
And do what?

289
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,353
You are one of us, Michael.

290
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:50,319
David!

291
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,315
Mike, wake up.

292
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,111
It's Mom.

293
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,489
- Mom's home?
- No, on the phone.

294
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,908
What time is it?

295
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,368
It's two o'clock.

296
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:24,162
Give me those sunglasses.

297
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,999
You need sunglasses to talk on the phone?

298
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:29,918
Are you freebasing?
Inquiring minds want to know.

299
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,218
- Hello?
- Michael, are you still in bed?

300
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,886
No. I'm up.

301
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,139
Michael, would you do me a favor?

302
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,683
Max asked me to go to dinner with him
after work tonight.

303
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,226
Would you stay home with Sam?

304
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:48,603
Sam is old enough to stay by himself.

305
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,897
I don't need no babysitter, Mike.

306
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:53,650
Michael, you come home
in the middle of the night...

307
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:55,277
...you sleep all day.

308
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:57,779
I work all day. Sam is always alone.

309
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:01,950
It's been a long time
since somebody's asked me out to dinner.

310
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,118
I'd like to go.

311
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,161
Okay?

312
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,205
Okay, Mom.

313
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,416
Thanks, it's a real favor.

314
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,126
Bye-bye.

315
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:29,519
Anything in here
that might pass for after-shave?

316
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,649
How about some Windex, Grandpa?

317
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,402
Yeah, let me try some of that.

318
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:48,955
Have a big date tonight, Grandpa?

319
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:55,629
I'm going to drop off some of
my handiwork to the "Widow" Johnson.

320
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:58,173
What'd you stuff for her? Mr. Johnson?

321
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,801
See you two guys later.

322
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,262
That wasn't funny!

323
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,319
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

324
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,446
Don't bother.

325
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:25,116
Lose the earring, Michael.
It's not you. It's definitely not you.

326
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,076
Piss off.

327
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,370
All you do is give attitude lately.

328
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,122
You've been watching too much Dynasty.

329
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:12,163
Mike, don't open the door!

330
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,891
What's going on, Mike?

331
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:33,935
Go take your bath.

332
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,282
Michael, are you there?

333
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:55,618
Nanook?

334
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:14,971
Michael, what happened?

335
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,973
- Nanook...
- What about Nanook?

336
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:18,891
What did you do to my dog, asshole?

337
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:22,437
Nothing. I didn't hurt him.
He bit me. This is my blood.

338
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:24,272
Why did he bite you, huh?

339
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,065
What did you do to him?

340
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:31,696
He was protecting you.

341
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,367
Look at your reflection in the mirror.

342
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,461
You're a creature of the night.

343
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,546
Just like out of a comic book.

344
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,298
You're a vampire, Michael!

345
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,009
My own brother,
a goddamn, shit-sucking vampire!

346
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:54,844
Wait till Mom finds out!

347
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:56,512
Sammy, wait! Sam!

348
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,473
- Stay back!
- Just let me talk-

349
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,475
Wait a minute! Sam!

350
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,854
Stay away from me, Mike!

351
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:40,515
You did the right thing by calling us.

352
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,933
Does your brother sleep a lot?

353
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,351
Yeah, all day.

354
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:45,436
Does the sunlight freak him out?

355
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,438
He wears sunglasses in the house.

356
00:41:47,522 --> 00:41:49,941
Bad breath? Long fingernails?

357
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,860
Yeah, his fingernails are a bit longer...

358
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,112
He always had bad breath, though.

359
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:57,573
He's a vampire all right.

360
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,408
Here's what you do.

361
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,953
Get yourself a good sharp stake...

362
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:03,788
...and drive it through his heart.

363
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,581
I can't do that! He's my brother!

364
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:07,542
Okay, we'll come over and do it for you.

365
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,376
No!

366
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,295
You better get yourself
a garlic T-shirt, buddy.

367
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:13,005
Or it's your funeral.

368
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,194
Hello.

369
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:19,113
Sam, is everything all right?

370
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,700
Mom, I think we have to have
a real long talk about something.

371
00:43:22,908 --> 00:43:24,118
Help!

372
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:27,455
What's going on there?
Sam, I'm starting to get worried.

373
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:32,877
What are you doing? Is that Michael?
Who's breathing like that?

374
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,505
- We should stay calm.
- Calm? Calm about what?

375
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:40,217
- Nothing, nothing.
- Who's making that noise?

376
00:43:40,676 --> 00:43:43,137
Mom, I can't talk on the phone.
It's about Michael.

377
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,098
Don't listen to him, Mom.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

378
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:47,141
Shut up!

379
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,976
Mom! Help! He's coming to get me!

380
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,561
Oh, my God!

381
00:43:51,937 --> 00:43:52,772
He'll kill me!

382
00:43:52,855 --> 00:43:54,357
Honey, I'm coming.

383
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,860
Tell him to get away! No! Mom!

384
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,333
Open up!

385
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,043
Stay back!

386
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:16,212
Sammy, help me! Open up!

387
00:44:16,295 --> 00:44:17,129
Help me!

388
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:18,881
Sammy, open the window!

389
00:44:18,964 --> 00:44:20,216
Never! I knew it!

390
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:21,300
I'm not!

391
00:44:21,383 --> 00:44:23,719
So what are you, the "flying nun"?

392
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:26,847
I'm your brother, Sammy. Help me!

393
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,017
Sammy, open up!

394
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:41,862
Please?

395
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,281
Please!

396
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,663
Thanks.

397
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,293
We've got to stick together, Sam.

398
00:44:56,752 --> 00:44:58,254
What about Mom?

399
00:44:58,337 --> 00:45:00,297
Just don't tell her anything.

400
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:04,301
I don't know, Mike.
It's not like getting a "D" in school.

401
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:08,931
We're gonna work this out.

402
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:11,517
I'm gonna work this out. Trust me, okay?

403
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,610
Sam, are you all right?

404
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:23,737
You had me scared to death.

405
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:26,490
I'm okay. I was reading a horror comic.

406
00:45:26,574 --> 00:45:30,536
I thought I saw someone on my window,
but I guess I got carried away.

407
00:45:30,703 --> 00:45:33,038
You got carried away by a comic book?

408
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,667
It was a scary comic book, Mom.
I'm sorry.

409
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:41,463
You know, I've just about had it
with the both of you.

410
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:47,219
What is this mess?

411
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,973
You spill milk on the kitchen floor
and don't even bother to clean it up?

412
00:45:51,056 --> 00:45:52,057
I didn't spill it.

413
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:55,185
I can't believe you.
The refrigerator door's wide open!

414
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:57,771
Are you trying to refrigerate
the whole neighborhood?

415
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:01,066
You know, it's not fair.
I'd like to have a personal life, too.

416
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,318
Where's Michael?

417
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,028
He went to bed early.

418
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:30,721
Mom? Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

419
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:33,223
In here? Are you sure you're all right?

420
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:35,392
I'm fine. It was a real scary comic,
that's all.

421
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:37,561
- Do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

422
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,106
Have you been eating pizza?

423
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,358
No. Why?

424
00:46:43,192 --> 00:46:44,860
You smell like garlic.

425
00:47:27,736 --> 00:47:29,113
Who's there?

426
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:33,659
Hello, Thorn.

427
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:36,745
Is that you, Thorn, making all that noise?

428
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:37,764
I'm over here, Michael.

429
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:40,017
What's happening to me, Star?

430
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,979
What's happening to me, Star?

431
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,772
Oh, Michael!

432
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:49,484
Michael, I can't tell you.
I don't know how to help you.

433
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,653
What's happening?

434
00:50:57,863 --> 00:50:58,864
Hi.

435
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,160
Aren't we friends anymore?

436
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,494
Sure.

437
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:09,541
Does that mean we are, or...?

438
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:11,418
We are.

439
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,129
Then let's act like friends.

440
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:15,338
Let's talk.

441
00:51:18,633 --> 00:51:20,677
Michael, take off your glasses.

442
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,518
Michael, look at me.

443
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:32,022
If there's a girl-

444
00:51:32,147 --> 00:51:32,981
I'm tired, Mom.

445
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:34,482
- We could talk about-
- I'm tired.

446
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:37,110
We can talk about anything
you want to talk about.

447
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:39,404
I have more serious things on my mind
than girls and school.

448
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:40,697
Things I'm dealing with-

449
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,699
Things I wouldn't understand?

450
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:57,672
Looks like I wasn't the only one
who got lucky last night.

451
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,427
Did you take care of everything, Michael?

452
00:52:22,238 --> 00:52:23,198
What's the wine for?

453
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:26,201
My apology to Max for running out
on him last night.

454
00:52:26,284 --> 00:52:28,745
Which, young man, you should be making.

455
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,087
I better bring this up to the house
or somebody's just gonna take it.

456
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,880
All right, I'll be here.

457
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:52,644
Hi, Thorn.

458
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,529
Mom!

459
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,295
Honey, get in the car! Get in the car!

460
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:25,385
The dog chased my mom like the Hounds
of Hell from Vampires Everywhere.

461
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:29,514
We've been aware of some very serious
vampire activity in town for a long time.

462
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:32,183
Santa Carla has become a haven
for the undead.

463
00:53:32,267 --> 00:53:34,561
As a matter of fact,
we're almost certain that...

464
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:37,897
...ghouls and werewolves
occupy high positions at City Hall.

465
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,483
Kill your brother. You'll feel better.

466
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,529
Look, guys, my brother is not
a bloodsucker.

467
00:53:44,612 --> 00:53:47,198
It says here that
if you kill the head vampire...

468
00:53:47,282 --> 00:53:49,576
...all half-vampires will return to normal.

469
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,704
Guys, if my brother's a vampire,
believe me, he's only half.

470
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:54,998
Does he know who the head vampire is?

471
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:56,666
No, I don't think so.

472
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,002
Then you'll have to kill him.

473
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:00,545
And if you don't...

474
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:02,464
...we will.

475
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:07,135
It all started when my mom
went to work at Max's video store.

476
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:10,722
Max never comes in till after it's dark.

477
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,516
The dog who chased my mom
this morning was his.

478
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,687
Listen to this: "Vampires require
a daytime protector, a guardian...

479
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,731
"... to watch over them as they sleep.

480
00:54:19,814 --> 00:54:23,902
"Fierce dogs, the Hounds of Hell,
are often employed for this purpose. "

481
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:28,239
What happens if my mom is dating
the head vampire?

482
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:31,576
You could nail him and save Santa Carla.

483
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,662
"Truth, Justice,
the American way" triumphs.

484
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:36,623
Thanks to you two.

485
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,834
We'll check out Max.

486
00:55:10,365 --> 00:55:11,908
Smells good. When do we eat?

487
00:55:11,991 --> 00:55:13,993
I told Max eight o'clock.

488
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,036
Max?

489
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,621
Are we going to have company again?

490
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:17,914
Again?

491
00:55:17,997 --> 00:55:21,417
You haven't had company in this house
since Mom died eight years ago.

492
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:23,753
Right. Now we're gonna
have company again.

493
00:55:23,836 --> 00:55:27,173
Michael, Max is coming to dinner.
I'd like you to meet him.

494
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:28,967
I can't. I have plans.

495
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,301
Michael...

496
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,472
Things will change around this house
when school starts.

497
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,436
How you doing?
You must be Michael, right?

498
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:44,148
And you must be Max.

499
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:54,534
Well, you're the man of the house...

500
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:57,036
...and I'm not coming
in until you invite me.

501
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,413
You're invited.

502
00:55:59,497 --> 00:56:00,915
Thanks very much.

503
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:11,884
Hello.

504
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,220
Oh, hi. I didn't hear you come in.

505
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:16,723
Is it okay for the guest to see the food
before dinner?

506
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:20,393
You're thinking of the groom
not seeing the bride before the wedding.

507
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:23,062
Oh, yeah. I always get those confused.

508
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,440
Thorn sends his apologies.

509
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:27,400
Tell him I'm walking again.

510
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:31,070
He promises to behave if you come back.

511
00:56:37,326 --> 00:56:38,536
Mom?

512
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,080
These are my dinner guests.

513
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,416
Edgar and Alan. The Frog brothers.

514
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,752
I didn't know you were having guests.

515
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:50,339
If we'll be in your way, we can eat
some peanut butter in the kitchen.

516
00:56:50,423 --> 00:56:52,467
No, no, there's plenty for everybody.

517
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,095
Max, this is my son, Sam,
and Edgar and Alan... Frog?

518
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,016
Lucy, this looks terrific.

519
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:02,018
Well, I hope it tastes good.

520
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:04,145
Tastes wonderful.

521
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:08,774
Boy! Somebody around here
has bad breath!

522
00:57:15,072 --> 00:57:17,241
Nanook, would you quit breathing on me!

523
00:57:17,325 --> 00:57:19,327
Nanook, get upstairs. Go on.

524
00:57:25,458 --> 00:57:27,793
You want some Parmesan cheese on that?

525
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,962
Yeah, Sam. Thank you very much.

526
00:57:30,463 --> 00:57:32,882
Sam grated the cheese himself. My son.

527
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:40,056
A budding chef in the family.

528
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:48,022
Are you all right?

529
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:52,068
It's not cheese, it's garlic.

530
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:53,819
You hate garlic, don't you?

531
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,864
No, I like garlic. It's just too much...

532
00:57:57,531 --> 00:57:58,908
It's raw garlic.

533
00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:01,786
Garlic? How did that happen?

534
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,496
Guys, he likes garlic.

535
00:58:05,122 --> 00:58:07,166
Here. Quick, drink some water!

536
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:11,087
Sam, what's the matter with you?

537
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,380
Does it burn?

538
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:14,048
Burn? Are you nuts?

539
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:15,841
It's freezing!

540
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,511
Look at your suit, Max. And your pants.

541
00:58:18,636 --> 00:58:20,596
Oh, I'm so sorry.

542
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:22,890
Now what?

543
00:58:22,974 --> 00:58:24,767
Must be a circuit breaker.

544
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:26,060
He's not glowing.

545
00:58:26,143 --> 00:58:27,895
I know. Hit the lights.

546
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,109
Sam! What's gotten into you tonight?

547
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,361
I think I know what's going on here.

548
00:58:35,444 --> 00:58:36,445
You do?

549
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:37,780
Yeah.

550
00:58:38,656 --> 00:58:41,075
I know what you're thinking, Sam.
But you're wrong.

551
00:58:41,158 --> 00:58:42,368
- I am?
- Yeah.

552
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,037
I'm not trying to replace your father...

553
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,081
...or steal your mother away from you.

554
00:58:47,164 --> 00:58:50,001
I would just like to be your friend.
That's all.

555
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:51,794
Good night, Lucy.

556
00:58:52,294 --> 00:58:53,546
Thanks a lot!

557
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,297
I'm sorry, Mom.

558
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:57,049
Max, I'm so sorry.

559
00:58:58,884 --> 00:59:00,177
Major mistake.

560
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,307
Our batting average isn't terrific, is it?
Zero for two.

561
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:07,685
You were so sweet to him.

562
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,730
I don't know what got into him.
He's not like that.

563
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:14,442
Kids Sam's age need discipline,
otherwise they run all over you.

564
00:59:14,692 --> 00:59:16,485
He doesn't run over me.

565
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:18,738
Protecting mother.

566
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,992
Let's try it once more.

567
00:59:23,075 --> 00:59:25,286
Dinner, my house, tomorrow night.

568
00:59:26,495 --> 00:59:27,997
- I'm cooking.
- Okay.

569
00:59:48,142 --> 00:59:49,393
Where is she?

570
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:53,981
Take it easy, Michael.

571
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:56,275
Where's Star, David?

572
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,196
If you ever want to see Star again...

573
01:00:00,654 --> 01:00:02,781
...you better come with us now.

574
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,329
Michael, over here.

575
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,588
You don't want to miss this.

576
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,572
Initiation's over, Michael.

577
01:01:26,323 --> 01:01:27,950
Time to join the club.

578
01:03:02,336 --> 01:03:04,087
Now you know what we are.

579
01:03:04,546 --> 01:03:06,298
Now you know what you are.

580
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,218
You'll never grow old, Michael.

581
01:03:10,427 --> 01:03:12,387
And you'll never die.

582
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:15,724
But you must feed.

583
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:45,003
I wish Grandpa would stop giving me
these stupid things.

584
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:57,933
I know who I am now, Sam.

585
01:03:58,183 --> 01:03:59,685
Don't kill me, Mike!

586
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:02,688
I'm basically a good kid, so don't kill me!

587
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,481
I can help you.

588
01:04:04,565 --> 01:04:06,817
Just tell me who the head vampire is.

589
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,027
I thought it was Max, but I was wrong.

590
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:11,738
Just work with me and I can help you.
You'll be okay.

591
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:12,864
Michael!

592
01:04:13,615 --> 01:04:14,658
Michael!

593
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:18,704
It's that girl from the boardwalk.
Is she one of them?

594
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:21,415
- I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
- No!

595
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,710
You shut the window and lock your door.

596
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:29,548
She's one of them!

597
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,593
And don't tell me it doesn't make her
a bad person, Mike!

598
01:04:34,594 --> 01:04:37,347
You know where David took me tonight,
don't you, Star?

599
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:38,432
Who's David?

600
01:04:38,515 --> 01:04:40,559
Yes, and it's my fault.

601
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:43,812
If you hadn't met me,
if I hadn't liked you...

602
01:04:44,229 --> 01:04:45,731
I tried to warn you.

603
01:04:45,939 --> 01:04:48,483
It was that night in the cave, wasn't it?

604
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,737
That wasn't wine they gave me to drink.
It was blood.

605
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,447
That was David's blood.

606
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:56,033
You drank someone's blood?
Are you crazy?

607
01:04:56,742 --> 01:04:58,744
I'm just like David now, Star.

608
01:04:58,827 --> 01:05:01,371
No, you're not. You're like Laddie and me.

609
01:05:01,455 --> 01:05:04,750
- We're not one of them-
- Until you make your first kill!

610
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:08,170
Why didn't you kill me last night?

611
01:05:09,212 --> 01:05:11,339
You were supposed to be my first.

612
01:05:12,049 --> 01:05:13,759
That's what David wanted.

613
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,930
But I couldn't, Michael.

614
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:20,015
Why?

615
01:05:21,058 --> 01:05:23,727
Because you care so much about me?

616
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:25,187
Yes, I do.

617
01:05:34,738 --> 01:05:37,657
What are you doing here?
What do you want from me?

618
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,745
I wanted to tell you
that it's not too late for you.

619
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,792
But for me it gets
harder and harder to resist.

620
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:48,251
I'm weak.

621
01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:50,879
Why did you come here tonight, Star?

622
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:54,216
I was hoping you would help
Laddie and me.

623
01:06:05,143 --> 01:06:06,228
Star!

624
01:06:06,686 --> 01:06:09,314
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you.

625
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:12,442
What are you doing?

626
01:06:12,526 --> 01:06:14,110
I've got connections.

627
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,377
Okay. Where's Nosferatu?

628
01:06:30,502 --> 01:06:31,962
- Who?
- The Prince of Darkness.

629
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:33,505
The night crawler. The bloodsucker.

630
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:34,840
El Vampiro.

631
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:36,758
Mike, they're here!

632
01:06:49,563 --> 01:06:52,274
Grandpa, okay if we borrow the car?

633
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,176
Weapons check.

634
01:07:26,516 --> 01:07:28,018
I don't want you going down there.

635
01:07:28,101 --> 01:07:29,311
I'm going.

636
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:32,230
Look, this isn't a comic book, Sammy.
These guys are brutal killers.

637
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,065
So are the Frog brothers.

638
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:36,067
Check me.

639
01:07:36,443 --> 01:07:39,362
Who'd you rather have go down there
with you? Them or me?

640
01:07:39,446 --> 01:07:42,741
If something happens down there,
I won't have the strength to protect you.

641
01:07:42,824 --> 01:07:44,659
This time I'll protect you.

642
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:48,580
Even though you're a vampire,
you're still my brother.

643
01:07:49,622 --> 01:07:54,002
Listen, just so you know: If you try
to stop us, or vamp-out in any way...

644
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:57,297
...I'll stake you without even
thinking twice about it.

645
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,840
Chill out, Edgar.

646
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:04,554
Where did you say you met these guys?

647
01:08:08,683 --> 01:08:09,809
Holy shit!

648
01:08:09,893 --> 01:08:11,186
Vampire hotel!

649
01:08:14,898 --> 01:08:16,775
Here's one. Let's stake her!

650
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:18,151
Don't you touch her!

651
01:08:18,234 --> 01:08:19,944
Stay away from her!

652
01:08:20,111 --> 01:08:22,697
Come on, vampires have
such rotten tempers.

653
01:08:25,575 --> 01:08:29,204
The rest of them have got to
be here someplace. We'll find 'em.

654
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:31,748
Star?

655
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:36,836
- I'm taking you out of here.
- No, take Laddie first.

656
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,921
Please?

657
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,675
I feel a draft.
I think there's something up here.

658
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:45,053
- Let's check it out, Sam.
- Come on.

659
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:53,436
I'll be right back, Mike.

660
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:55,688
I hope.

661
01:08:55,772 --> 01:08:57,565
Come on, Sam, let's go.

662
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,025
Move out! Move!

663
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:04,989
Flies!

664
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:06,366
We're on the right trail.

665
01:09:06,449 --> 01:09:09,160
Flies and the undead go together,
like bullets and guns.

666
01:09:09,244 --> 01:09:10,286
Come on!

667
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,601
What's that smell?

668
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:37,689
Vampires, my friend. Vampires.

669
01:09:57,709 --> 01:09:59,335
It's freezing in here.

670
01:10:03,756 --> 01:10:05,925
It looks like a dead end. Let's head back.

671
01:10:06,009 --> 01:10:09,012
They must have hidden their coffins
here someplace.

672
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:11,222
There's nothing here. Let's go, guys.

673
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:12,348
Jesus!

674
01:10:20,732 --> 01:10:22,734
I thought they'd be in coffins.

675
01:10:22,817 --> 01:10:24,068
That's what this cave is.

676
01:10:24,152 --> 01:10:25,737
It's one giant coffin.

677
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,492
Right now they're at their most vulnerable.

678
01:10:31,576 --> 01:10:32,827
Easy pickings.

679
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:34,996
Remember, you just have to kill the leader.

680
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:37,081
We don't know which one he is.

681
01:10:37,373 --> 01:10:39,500
I guess we'll just have to kill them all.

682
01:10:39,584 --> 01:10:43,338
Let's start with the little one.
First come, first staked.

683
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:46,299
What was that, a little vampire humor?

684
01:10:46,674 --> 01:10:48,134
It wasn't funny.

685
01:10:53,222 --> 01:10:54,682
No!

686
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:57,435
Good night, bloodsucker!

687
01:11:18,915 --> 01:11:20,875
You're dead meat!

688
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:45,608
Get him into the sunlight!

689
01:12:12,301 --> 01:12:13,553
Tonight...

690
01:12:15,888 --> 01:12:17,723
Mike! Start the car!

691
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:29,068
- We blew it, man! We lost it!
- Shut up!

692
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:31,529
- We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
- It's not our fault.

693
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:34,240
They pulled a mind-scramble on us!
They opened their eyes and talked!

694
01:12:34,323 --> 01:12:35,867
I'll drive.

695
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,702
We don't ride with vampires.

696
01:12:37,785 --> 01:12:39,203
Fine. Stay here.

697
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:42,874
- We do now.
- Yeah.

698
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:46,002
Come on! Sam, let's get out of here!

699
01:12:47,003 --> 01:12:48,212
Burn rubber!

700
01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:58,139
"Burn rubber" does not mean warp speed!

701
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:09,942
Cool it, Nanook!

702
01:13:10,026 --> 01:13:11,736
Your dog knows a flesh-eater
when he smells one.

703
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:13,654
Take him outside, Sam.

704
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,990
Come on, Nanook.

705
01:13:18,826 --> 01:13:19,952
Michael.

706
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:24,248
Do you know the rule
about filling up the car with gas...

707
01:13:24,332 --> 01:13:26,375
...when you take it without asking?

708
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:27,835
No, Grandpa.

709
01:13:28,586 --> 01:13:29,837
Now you do.

710
01:13:39,513 --> 01:13:41,098
We definitely blew Plan A.

711
01:13:41,182 --> 01:13:42,224
Time to activate Plan B.

712
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:43,893
- What's Plan B?
- We don't have one yet.

713
01:13:43,976 --> 01:13:45,770
We have two and a half hours
to come up with one.

714
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:47,021
What happens then?

715
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:49,774
The sun goes down.
They'll be looking for us.

716
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:58,199
Sam, what are you doing here?

717
01:13:58,282 --> 01:14:00,785
I've got to tell you something.
It's real important.

718
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:03,204
Santa Carla is crawling with vampires.

719
01:14:03,537 --> 01:14:04,622
Mom, I'm serious!

720
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:07,124
Edgar staked one of them.
It was screaming and fizzing!

721
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:09,085
Look, there's evidence on my sweater!

722
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:11,253
Mom, you've got to tell someone!

723
01:14:11,587 --> 01:14:13,881
- You've got to tell someone!
- This isn't funny!

724
01:14:13,964 --> 01:14:16,634
I'm not kidding! They're coming
to the house when it gets dark!

725
01:14:16,717 --> 01:14:18,928
Stop it! Right now! Stop it!

726
01:14:19,637 --> 01:14:21,305
- But, Mom-
- Not another word!

727
01:14:21,389 --> 01:14:22,640
I don't believe you're doing this.

728
01:14:22,723 --> 01:14:24,850
I want to see Max tonight,
and you're trying to ruin it for me.

729
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:26,060
No, I'm not.

730
01:14:26,143 --> 01:14:29,313
There's nothing wrong with Max.
I don't know why you don't want me-

731
01:14:29,397 --> 01:14:32,024
I'm not talking about Max!
To hell with Max!

732
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,612
I'll deal with you later, young man!

733
01:14:42,451 --> 01:14:44,328
Guys, we're on our own.

734
01:14:44,495 --> 01:14:46,872
Good. That's just the way we like it.

735
01:15:20,156 --> 01:15:23,367
Widow Johnson called.
Said to pick her up at seven, not eight.

736
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,202
We've got a date tonight?

737
01:15:25,411 --> 01:15:27,746
I guess so. She said not to be late.

738
01:15:28,539 --> 01:15:30,541
I better get cleaned up, then.

739
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:54,315
Die, Mr. Vampire!

740
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:19,340
They'll be coming for Laddie and me,
won't they?

741
01:16:20,507 --> 01:16:22,593
They'll be coming for all of us.

742
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,221
Laddie, wake up.

743
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:43,173
- Oh, it's delicious.
- Thank you.

744
01:17:45,426 --> 01:17:46,969
Thorn, stop that!

745
01:17:49,179 --> 01:17:50,848
What's the matter, Lucy?

746
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:53,350
It's just old memories coming back.

747
01:17:53,559 --> 01:17:56,186
No, seriously.
Why are you so jumpy tonight?

748
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:57,729
Well, it's something Sam-

749
01:17:57,813 --> 01:17:59,523
He came into the store...

750
01:17:59,606 --> 01:18:02,484
It was just a kid's imagination,
I'm sure, but...

751
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:04,736
...he seemed so sincere, but...

752
01:18:05,612 --> 01:18:06,697
It's insane.

753
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,949
Tell me. I promise not to laugh.

754
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:10,284
Honest.

755
01:18:15,873 --> 01:18:17,416
I think I should warn you all:

756
01:18:17,499 --> 01:18:20,169
When a vampire dies,
it's never a pretty sight.

757
01:18:20,252 --> 01:18:22,796
No two bloodsuckers go out the same way.

758
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:25,299
Some yell and scream. Some go quietly.

759
01:18:25,382 --> 01:18:27,301
Some explode. Some implode.

760
01:18:27,968 --> 01:18:30,345
But all will try to take you with them.

761
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:49,615
Nanook! I left him outside.

762
01:18:49,698 --> 01:18:51,700
Don't go out there! Stop him!

763
01:18:54,244 --> 01:18:55,996
- Sam, come back!
- No way!

764
01:19:20,437 --> 01:19:22,648
Michael, they're coming!

765
01:19:24,942 --> 01:19:26,526
They're coming!

766
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,322
Hurry up, man!

767
01:19:43,043 --> 01:19:44,753
Take them upstairs!

768
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:03,939
- I say we terminate them right now.
- Laddie, run!

769
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,949
You're mine.

770
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:16,326
You killed Marko.

771
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,786
Yeah. You're next.

772
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:19,413
No. You're next.

773
01:20:25,168 --> 01:20:27,129
Garlic don't work, boys.

774
01:20:27,212 --> 01:20:29,381
Try the holy water, death breath!

775
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:02,182
Mike, wake up.

776
01:22:42,305 --> 01:22:43,765
You missed, sucker.

777
01:22:43,974 --> 01:22:45,308
Only once, pal.

778
01:23:16,006 --> 01:23:17,757
Death by stereo.

779
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,250
Hey, it's me.

780
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,334
Are you okay?

781
01:23:53,418 --> 01:23:56,504
I nailed one of them downstairs
with a bow and arrow.

782
01:23:57,756 --> 01:23:59,883
We trashed the one
that looked like Twisted Sister.

783
01:23:59,966 --> 01:24:02,635
We totally annihilated
his night stalkin' ass!

784
01:24:04,012 --> 01:24:05,805
And Nanook helped a little.

785
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:08,641
Death to all vampires!

786
01:24:08,725 --> 01:24:10,185
Maximum body count.

787
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:11,895
We are awesome monster bashers!

788
01:24:11,978 --> 01:24:13,104
The meanest!

789
01:24:13,188 --> 01:24:14,481
The baddest!

790
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:34,876
Holy shit!

791
01:24:34,959 --> 01:24:37,295
The attack of Eddie Munster! Get him!

792
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:40,423
Stop! Get away from him!
Just stay away from him!

793
01:24:40,507 --> 01:24:42,175
He's just a little boy!

794
01:25:00,777 --> 01:25:02,862
You're afraid to face me, David?

795
01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:11,079
I tried to make you immortal.

796
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:13,164
You tried to make me a killer!

797
01:25:23,216 --> 01:25:24,676
You are a killer.

798
01:25:47,532 --> 01:25:48,783
My turn.

799
01:25:58,001 --> 01:26:01,921
Stop fighting me, Michael.
I don't want to kill you.

800
01:26:02,922 --> 01:26:03,923
Join us.

801
01:26:04,841 --> 01:26:06,050
Never!

802
01:26:09,304 --> 01:26:12,098
It's too late. My blood is in your veins.

803
01:26:15,435 --> 01:26:17,145
So is mine!

804
01:27:19,499 --> 01:27:21,584
Don't let them see me like this.

805
01:27:25,713 --> 01:27:26,964
Get away, Sam.

806
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,384
- Michael, what's wrong?
- I said, get away!

807
01:27:35,348 --> 01:27:37,934
What's the big deal?
You destroyed the head vampire.

808
01:27:38,017 --> 01:27:39,060
It's all over.

809
01:27:39,143 --> 01:27:40,603
Nothing's changed.

810
01:27:40,895 --> 01:27:43,356
He's right. I don't feel any different.

811
01:27:43,481 --> 01:27:45,399
Then there's still one more.

812
01:27:52,573 --> 01:27:54,909
I'll handle Mom. Come on, go.

813
01:27:55,034 --> 01:27:56,953
Don't let her see the bodies.

814
01:27:59,163 --> 01:28:00,373
What happened?

815
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:02,959
Where is Michael?

816
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:05,127
What happened to your face?

817
01:28:05,336 --> 01:28:07,213
What happened to your face?

818
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:34,532
I don't want to hear another word
from you until I talk to Michael.

819
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,242
I'm sorry, Lucy.

820
01:28:36,951 --> 01:28:38,494
This is all my fault.

821
01:28:39,245 --> 01:28:41,205
David and my boys misbehaved.

822
01:28:42,456 --> 01:28:44,750
I told you, boys need a mother.

823
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:47,086
Max, what are you talking about?

824
01:28:49,171 --> 01:28:51,674
I knew it! You're the head vampire!

825
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:53,634
Sam, don't start this again.

826
01:28:53,718 --> 01:28:56,345
You're the secret
that David was protecting.

827
01:28:58,055 --> 01:28:59,140
Who's this?

828
01:28:59,223 --> 01:29:00,933
But you passed the test.

829
01:29:01,934 --> 01:29:05,646
Don't ever invite a vampire
into your house, you silly boy.

830
01:29:05,896 --> 01:29:07,606
It renders you powerless.

831
01:29:08,316 --> 01:29:09,692
Did you know that?

832
01:29:09,775 --> 01:29:10,860
Of course.

833
01:29:10,943 --> 01:29:12,320
Everyone knows that.

834
01:29:12,403 --> 01:29:16,073
Has everyone gone crazy?
What's the matter with all of you?

835
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:19,452
It was you I was after, all along, Lucy.

836
01:29:19,618 --> 01:29:20,619
What?

837
01:29:20,786 --> 01:29:21,871
I knew...

838
01:29:22,788 --> 01:29:26,042
...that if I could get Sam and Michael
into the family...

839
01:29:26,459 --> 01:29:28,210
...there was no way you could say no.

840
01:29:28,294 --> 01:29:29,754
Where's Michael?

841
01:29:29,962 --> 01:29:32,465
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.

842
01:29:36,385 --> 01:29:38,554
Just like one big happy family.

843
01:29:41,682 --> 01:29:42,933
Your boys...

844
01:29:44,477 --> 01:29:45,728
...and my boys.

845
01:29:45,811 --> 01:29:48,439
Great. "The Bloodsucking Brady Bunch. "

846
01:29:49,815 --> 01:29:51,484
I still want you, Lucy.

847
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:56,030
I haven't changed my mind about that.

848
01:29:56,697 --> 01:29:58,949
I didn't invite you this time, Max!

849
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,785
Michael!

850
01:30:18,177 --> 01:30:19,970
Don't you touch my mother!

851
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:33,067
Don't fight, Lucy.
It's so much better if you don't fight.

852
01:30:34,235 --> 01:30:35,611
Mom, don't!

853
01:30:36,821 --> 01:30:39,031
Don't do it, Mom! Mom, don't do it!

854
01:31:37,464 --> 01:31:39,174
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

855
01:31:59,903 --> 01:32:01,488
It's over.

856
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:13,792
Is everybody okay?

857
01:32:22,634 --> 01:32:24,303
Oh, my boys.

858
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:28,057
How much do you think
we should charge them for this?

859
01:32:35,814 --> 01:32:36,857
Dad?

860
01:32:43,364 --> 01:32:45,074
Dad, are you all right?

861
01:32:50,704 --> 01:32:54,291
One thing about livin' in Santa Carla
I never could stomach...

862
01:32:55,501 --> 01:32:57,544
All the damn vampires.
