1
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,964
<i>Come on.</i>

2
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>Come on man.
Come on, let him through. Come on.</i>

3
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:37,347
<i>Come on, hold him back, man,
hold him back, man. Back off, man.</i>

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:40,247
I told you to stay off the boardwalk.

5
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,635
Okay, boys, let's go.

6
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:59,564
You, too, off the boardwalk.

7
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:19,102
<i>Keep going.</i>

8
00:03:19,185 --> 00:03:20,937
<i>Hey, I liked that song.</i>

9
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:22,897
<i>Keep going, Mom.</i>

10
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:24,941
<i>- How about this?
- Hang on.</i>

11
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:27,527
<i>I don't see any bogeymen or nasty guys.</i>

12
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:33,491
<i>Keep going. You want to switch the band?</i>

13
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,174
- Keep going!
- Wait. That's from my era!

14
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,100
We're almost there.

15
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:00,977
What's that smell?

16
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:02,937
That's the ocean air.

17
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,814
Smells like someone died.

18
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:08,109
Guys, I know the last year
hasn't been easy, but...

19
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:11,696
...I think you're really going to like
living in Santa Carla.

20
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:56,366
There's an amusement park
right on the beach.

21
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,119
Sam, tell those kids
to get something to eat.

22
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,246
Any jobs around here?

23
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:02,831
Nothing legal.

24
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:37,217
Come on, Nanook.

25
00:06:58,947 --> 00:06:59,948
Dad?

26
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:01,908
Dad?

27
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,493
Looks like he's dead.

28
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:05,495
No, he's just a deep sleeper.

29
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:08,206
If he's dead, can we go back to Phoenix?

30
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:10,250
Playing dead...

31
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,670
...and from what I heard,
doing a damn good job of it, too.

32
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:24,639
This is a pretty cool place.

33
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:26,850
<i>For The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

34
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,935
Come on, Sam, give Mom a break.

35
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,354
What's wrong with this picture?

36
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:35,608
There's no TV. Have you seen a TV?
I haven't seen a TV.

37
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:38,820
You know what it means
when there's no TV? No MTV.

38
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:40,905
Sammy, we are flat broke.

39
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,120
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew...

40
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:50,415
...who didn't improve her situation
by getting divorced.

41
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:52,083
I know.

42
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:56,796
But a big legal war wasn't going
to improve anybody's situation.

43
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,841
We've all been through enough.

44
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,886
Anyway, I was raised better than that.

45
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:04,846
Ouch, my hair.

46
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,058
Mom, you gotta help me.

47
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:13,188
Hey, guys, no running in the house!

48
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,990
<i>Talk about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

49
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:26,826
Rules!

50
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:30,163
We've got some rules around here.

51
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,707
Second shelf is mine.

52
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,836
That's where I keep my root beers
and my double-thick Oreo cookies.

53
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:40,089
Nobody touches the second shelf, but me.

54
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:44,761
There's another rule around here,
and I want you to pay close attention.

55
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,846
Don't touch anything.

56
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,932
Everything is exactly where I want it.

57
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:50,016
Grandpa...

58
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:53,770
...is it true that Santa Carla's
the murder capital of the world?

59
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,397
There are some bad elements around here.

60
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,107
Wait, let me get this straight.

61
00:08:58,191 --> 00:09:00,902
You're telling me we've moved
to the murder capital of the world?

62
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,320
Are you serious, Grandpa?

63
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,113
Well, let me put it this way.

64
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:08,118
If all the corpses buried around here
were to stand up all at once...

65
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,912
...we'd have one hell
of a population problem.

66
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:13,581
Great, Dad.

67
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:15,416
Now, on Wednesdays...

68
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,961
<i>...when the mailman brings the TV Guide...</i>

69
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:21,339
...sometimes the address label
is curled up just a little.

70
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:24,008
You'll be tempted to tear it off. Don't.

71
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:28,012
You'll only wind up rippin' the cover
and I don't like that.

72
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:29,722
And stay outta here.

73
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,642
- You have a TV?
- No.

74
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:35,061
<i>I just like to read the TV Guide.</i>

75
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,106
<i>If you read the TV Guide,
you don't need a TV.</i>

76
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,201
I can't find my mom.

77
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:58,705
What's the matter?

78
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,209
Are you lost?

79
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:13,803
Let's ask in here.

80
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,014
Excuse me, I wonder if you could help us.

81
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:19,350
This boy is lost and we're wondering
if his mother might be in here.

82
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,935
I don't really know.

83
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,397
I was so worried!

84
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:26,441
Don't run off like that.

85
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:27,484
There you are.

86
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:28,818
Thank you.

87
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,320
Bye, Terry.

88
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,406
We only come here to watch one thing.

89
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,409
Well done.

90
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:37,619
No, thanks.

91
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:40,038
Well, on second thought...

92
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:43,792
I told you not to come in here anymore.

93
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:55,094
Wild kids.

94
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:58,431
Oh, they're just young.
We were that age, too, once.

95
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:04,479
Only they dress better. Bye-bye.

96
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:07,607
You have a generous nature.
I like that in a person.

97
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,151
- My name is Max.
- I'm Lucy.

98
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,863
- That's my dog, Thorn.
- Hi, Thorn.

99
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:15,031
Say "hello," Thorn.

100
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:16,991
So how may I help you this evening?

101
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,118
We have it all.

102
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:20,370
The best selection of video tapes
in Santa Carla.

103
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:23,081
No, I'm not looking for a tape.

104
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:24,999
What I need is...

105
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,334
A job?

106
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:27,627
...a job.

107
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:29,796
Yeah. I look that needy, huh?

108
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:39,597
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

109
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:41,224
So what's the rush?

110
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,226
You're chasing that girl, aren't you?

111
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:45,562
Come on, admit it. You're chasing her.

112
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,564
I'm at the mercy of your sex glands.

113
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,568
Don't you have something better to do
than follow me around all night?

114
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,155
Actually, I do.

115
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:33,818
Got a problem guys?

116
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,780
Just scoping your civilian wardrobe.

117
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,448
Pretty cool, huh?

118
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:40,658
For a fashion victim.

119
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,162
If you're looking for
the diet frozen-yogurt bar...

120
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,456
...it went out of business last summer.

121
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,250
<i>Actually, I'm looking for Batman, no. 14.</i>

122
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:50,960
That's a very serious book, man.

123
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,587
Only five in existence.

124
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,005
Four, actually.

125
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:57,217
I'm always lookin' out for the other three.

126
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,514
<i>You can't put the Superman, no. 77
with the 200s.</i>

127
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:04,766
They haven't even discovered
red kryptonite yet.

128
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:08,561
And you can't put the no. 98 with the 300s.

129
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:11,356
Lori Lemaris hasn't even been introduced.

130
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:13,608
Where the hell are you from? Krypton?

131
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:15,193
Phoenix, actually.

132
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,487
But, lucky me, we moved...

133
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,572
...here.

134
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:25,328
Take this.

135
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:29,457
I don't like horror comics.

136
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,709
You'll like this one, Mr. Phoenix.

137
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,170
It could save your life.

138
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:18,673
Come on, she stiffed ya.

139
00:16:44,324 --> 00:16:46,159
- What was that?
- What was what?

140
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,745
- I thought I heard something.
- Forget it.

141
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:13,269
- How do you like that baby?
- It's a beauty.

142
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:14,938
Come on, let's get in.

143
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,732
Can I drive on the way back?

144
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:20,819
Fat chance.
Nobody drives this baby, but me.

145
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:35,041
We have to let it warm up a little.

146
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,211
Hear that sound?
Just like a baby pussycat.

147
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:41,756
Okay, let's go to town.

148
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,055
Are we having fun, or what?

149
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:50,807
I thought we were going to town.

150
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,726
That's as close to town as I like to get.

151
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:55,436
Total weirdo, man.

152
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:20,837
Noticed anything unusual
about Santa Carla yet?

153
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,881
No, it's a pretty cool place.

154
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,468
- If you're a Martian.
- Or a vampire.

155
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:30,054
Are you sniffing old newsprint
or something?

156
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:32,557
You think you really know
what's happening here.

157
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,977
Well, I'll tell you something.
You don't know shit, buddy.

158
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:39,647
You think we just work in
a comic bookstore for our folks?

159
00:18:39,731 --> 00:18:41,774
Actually, I thought it was a bakery.

160
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:43,610
This is just our cover.

161
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,780
We're dedicated to a higher purpose.

162
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,032
We're fighters for "Truth...

163
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:52,285
"...Justice, and the American way."

164
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:54,078
All right.

165
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,334
Read this.

166
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,629
I told you I don't like horror comics.

167
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,381
Think of it more as a survival manual.

168
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:07,717
There's our number on the back...

169
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,261
...and pray you never need to call us.

170
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:12,722
I'll pray...

171
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:15,391
...I never need to call you.

172
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:16,893
Sure.

173
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:31,574
It looks great. Definitely. Enjoy it.

174
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,368
Thanks.

175
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,043
Excuse me.

176
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,963
It won't hurt.

177
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:50,385
It's a rip-off.

178
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:55,723
Hi.

179
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,561
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.

180
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,438
What's your name?

181
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:03,731
Star.

182
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,608
Oh, your folks, too, huh?

183
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,111
- What do you mean?
- Ex-hippies.

184
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:11,531
I came this close to being called
Moon Beam or Moon Child.

185
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:13,491
Or something like that.

186
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:16,911
But Star's great. I like Star.

187
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:18,455
Me, too.

188
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:20,665
I'm Michael.

189
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,543
Michael's great. I like Michael.

190
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:27,964
Want to get something to eat?

191
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:29,215
Okay.

192
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:40,894
Where are you going, Star?

193
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:43,563
For a ride. This is Michael.

194
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,191
Let's go.

195
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:47,317
Star?

196
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:06,461
You know where Hudson's Bluff is,
overlooking the point?

197
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:08,922
I can't beat your bike.

198
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,174
You don't have to beat me, Michael.

199
00:21:11,257 --> 00:21:13,426
You just have to try and keep up.

200
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,305
We're going for a ride.

201
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,396
Come on!

202
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:01,034
Come on, Michael!

203
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,388
- What the hell are you doing?
- No!

204
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:26,559
Just you! Come on!

205
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,353
Just you!

206
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:32,232
Come on, just you.

207
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:36,736
How far are you willing to go, Michael?

208
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,586
Hit the rock box, buddy.

209
00:24:01,636 --> 00:24:03,012
Not bad, huh?

210
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,725
This was the hottest resort in Santa Carla
about 85 years ago.

211
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:10,603
Too bad they built it on a fault.

212
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:13,439
In 1906...

213
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:16,609
...when the big one hit San Francisco...

214
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:20,155
...the ground opened up,
and this place took a header...

215
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:21,948
...right into the crack.

216
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,286
Now it's ours.

217
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,413
So, check it out, Mikey.

218
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:30,457
Marko...

219
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,208
Food.

220
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:36,171
That's what I love about this place.

221
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:38,173
You ask, and then you get.

222
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:44,762
Appetizer?

223
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,311
You'll like it here, Michael.

224
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:56,608
Ten o'clock. Lights out.

225
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:58,610
Did you brush your teeth?

226
00:24:58,693 --> 00:25:00,028
Okay, 'night, sweetheart.

227
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,196
Mom?

228
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:05,700
Sorry.

229
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:09,662
I can never sleep
with the closet door open, either.

230
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:11,247
Not even a crack.

231
00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:15,668
Sam, this is a terrible thing to admit,
but I think that...

232
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,506
...one of the reasons
I divorced your father...

233
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:23,092
...was because he never believed
in the closet monster.

234
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:30,225
Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!

235
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,520
Brought you somethin'
to dress up your room with, Sam.

236
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:35,939
How do you like that?

237
00:25:36,064 --> 00:25:37,065
Thanks, Grandpa.

238
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,776
Oh, Dad, really! You shouldn't have!

239
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:42,737
Lots more where he came from.

240
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:45,198
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Grandpa.

241
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:48,618
Lights, Sam.

242
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:51,037
As soon as I finish this comic, okay?

243
00:26:06,386 --> 00:26:08,513
You're history, buddy.

244
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,568
Feeding time. Come and get it, boys.

245
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,240
Chinese. Good choice.

246
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:30,201
Over here, bud.

247
00:26:31,786 --> 00:26:33,037
Guests first.

248
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:35,832
You don't like rice?

249
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:39,586
Tell me, Michael, how could
a billion Chinese people be wrong?

250
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:42,881
Come on.

251
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:54,058
How are those maggots?

252
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:57,020
Maggots, Michael.

253
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:59,606
You're eating maggots.
How do they taste?

254
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:08,323
Leave him alone.

255
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,588
Sorry about that.

256
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:25,632
No hard feelings, huh?

257
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,638
Why don't you try some noodles?

258
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:36,768
- They're worms.
- What do you mean, worms?

259
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,979
Don't eat...

260
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,943
They're only noodles, Michael.

261
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:51,241
That's enough.

262
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:36,619
Drink some of this, Michael.

263
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:40,206
Be one of us.

264
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:00,727
Don't! You don't have to, Michael.

265
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:07,275
It's blood.

266
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,320
Yeah, sure.

267
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:14,324
Bravo!

268
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:21,247
You were right, Marko.

269
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:30,089
You're one of us, bud.

270
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,866
Perfect timing.

271
00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:41,953
What's going on?

272
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,583
Michael wants to know "what's going on."

273
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:49,252
Marko?

274
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:51,421
"What's going on?"

275
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:52,881
I don't know.

276
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:54,591
"What's going on," Paul?

277
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:57,260
- Who wants to know?
- Michael wants to know.

278
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,806
I think we should let Michael know
"what's going on."

279
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:06,686
Marko...

280
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:08,521
Good night, Michael.

281
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:09,939
Bombs away.

282
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:12,984
Bottoms up, man.

283
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:21,826
Come with us, Michael.

284
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:35,298
Michael Emerson...

285
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:37,926
Come on down.

286
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:54,400
Welcome aboard, Michael.

287
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:56,486
Fun, huh?

288
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:12,752
Hold on!

289
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,393
Don't be scared, Michael!

290
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:39,070
Michael, you're one of us. Let go!

291
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,030
And do what?

292
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:43,408
You are one of us, Michael.

293
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:50,373
David!

294
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:10,370
Mike, wake up.

295
00:34:12,872 --> 00:34:14,165
It's Mom.

296
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,544
- Mom's home?
- No, on the phone.

297
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:19,963
What time is it?

298
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:21,422
It's two o'clock.

299
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,217
Give me those sunglasses.

300
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:27,053
You need sunglasses to talk on the phone?

301
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:29,973
Are you freebasing?
Inquiring minds want to know.

302
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:38,273
<i>- Hello?
- Michael, are you still in bed?</i>

303
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:39,941
No. I'm up.

304
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:42,193
Michael, would you do me a favor?

305
00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:44,737
Max asked me to go to dinner with him
after work tonight.

306
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:46,281
Would you stay home with Sam?

307
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:48,658
Sam is old enough to stay by himself.

308
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:50,952
I don't need no babysitter, Mike.

309
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:53,705
Michael, you come home
in the middle of the night...

310
00:34:53,788 --> 00:34:55,331
...you sleep all day.

311
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:57,834
<i>I work all day. Sam is always alone.</i>

312
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,005
It's been a long time
since somebody's asked me out to dinner.

313
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:03,173
I'd like to go.

314
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:04,215
<i>Okay?</i>

315
00:35:06,134 --> 00:35:07,260
Okay, Mom.

316
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:09,471
Thanks, it's a real favor.

317
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:11,181
Bye-bye.

318
00:35:26,613 --> 00:35:29,574
Anything in here
that might pass for after-shave?

319
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,704
How about some Windex, Grandpa?

320
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:37,457
Yeah, let me try some of that.

321
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:49,010
Have a big date tonight, Grandpa?

322
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:55,683
I'm going to drop off some of
my handiwork to the "Widow" Johnson.

323
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:58,228
What'd you stuff for her? Mr. Johnson?

324
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,856
See you two guys later.

325
00:36:02,816 --> 00:36:04,317
That wasn't funny!

326
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:19,374
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

327
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,501
Don't bother.

328
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:25,171
Lose the earring, Michael.
It's not you. It's definitely not you.

329
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:26,131
Piss off.

330
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:28,424
All you do is give attitude lately.

331
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:31,177
<i>You've been watching too much Dynasty.</i>

332
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,218
Mike, don't open the door!

333
00:37:30,236 --> 00:37:31,946
What's going on, Mike?

334
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,990
Go take your bath.

335
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:52,337
Michael, are you there?

336
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:55,673
Nanook?

337
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:15,026
Michael, what happened?

338
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:17,028
- Nanook...
- What about Nanook?

339
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:18,947
What did you do to my dog, asshole?

340
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,492
Nothing. I didn't hurt him.
He bit me. This is my blood.

341
00:40:22,617 --> 00:40:24,327
Why did he bite you, huh?

342
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,121
What did you do to him?

343
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,751
He was protecting you.

344
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:36,422
Look at your reflection in the mirror.

345
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:46,516
You're a creature of the night.

346
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,601
Just like out of a comic book.

347
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:50,353
You're a vampire, Michael!

348
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:53,064
My own brother,
a goddamn, shit-sucking vampire!

349
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:54,899
Wait till Mom finds out!

350
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:56,568
Sammy, wait! Sam!

351
00:40:56,776 --> 00:40:58,528
- Stay back!
- Just let me talk...

352
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:00,530
Wait a minute! Sam!

353
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:04,909
Stay away from me, Mike!

354
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,570
You did the right thing by calling us.

355
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:41,988
Does your brother sleep a lot?

356
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:43,406
Yeah, all day.

357
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:45,492
<i>Does the sunlight freak him out?</i>

358
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:47,494
He wears sunglasses in the house.

359
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:49,996
<i>Bad breath? Long fingernails?</i>

360
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,916
Yeah, his fingernails are a bit longer...

361
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:55,168
He always had bad breath, though.

362
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:57,629
He's a vampire all right.

363
00:41:57,837 --> 00:41:59,464
<i>Here's what you do.</i>

364
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:02,008
Get yourself a good sharp stake...

365
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:03,843
...and drive it through his heart.

366
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:05,637
I can't do that! He's my brother!

367
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,597
<i>Okay, we'll come over and do it for you.</i>

368
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,431
No!

369
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:11,351
You better get yourself
a garlic T-shirt, buddy.

370
00:42:11,434 --> 00:42:13,061
Or it's your funeral.

371
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:17,250
Hello.

372
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,169
Sam, is everything all right?

373
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:22,755
Mom, I think we have to have
a real long talk about something.

374
00:43:22,964 --> 00:43:24,174
Help!

375
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:27,510
<i>What's going on there?
Sam, I'm starting to get worried.</i>

376
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:32,932
<i>What are you doing? Is that Michael?
Who's breathing like that?</i>

377
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:36,561
<i>- We should stay calm.
- Calm? Calm about what?</i>

378
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,273
<i>- Nothing, nothing.
- Who's making that noise?</i>

379
00:43:40,732 --> 00:43:43,193
Mom, I can't talk on the phone.
It's about Michael.

380
00:43:43,276 --> 00:43:46,154
<i>Don't listen to him, Mom.
He doesn't know what he's saying.</i>

381
00:43:46,237 --> 00:43:47,197
Shut up!

382
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,032
Mom! Help! He's coming to get me!

383
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:50,617
Oh, my God!

384
00:43:51,993 --> 00:43:52,827
He'll kill me!

385
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:54,412
Honey, I'm coming.

386
00:43:55,622 --> 00:43:57,916
<i>Tell him to get away! No! Mom!</i>

387
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,388
Open up!

388
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:14,098
Stay back!

389
00:44:14,224 --> 00:44:16,267
Sammy, help me! Open up!

390
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:17,185
Help me!

391
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:18,937
Sammy, open the window!

392
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,271
Never! I knew it!

393
00:44:20,355 --> 00:44:21,356
I'm not!

394
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:23,775
So what are you, the "flying nun"?

395
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:26,903
I'm your brother, Sammy. Help me!

396
00:44:28,154 --> 00:44:30,073
Sammy, open up!

397
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:41,918
Please?

398
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:44,337
Please!

399
00:44:49,509 --> 00:44:50,718
Thanks.

400
00:44:52,846 --> 00:44:56,349
We've got to stick together, Sam.

401
00:44:56,808 --> 00:44:58,309
What about Mom?

402
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:00,353
Just don't tell her anything.

403
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,357
I don't know, Mike.
It's not like getting a "D" in school.

404
00:45:07,777 --> 00:45:08,987
We're gonna work this out.

405
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,573
I'm gonna work this out. Trust me, okay?

406
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:21,666
Sam, are you all right?

407
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:23,793
You had me scared to death.

408
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:26,546
I'm okay. I was reading a horror comic.

409
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:30,592
I thought I saw someone on my window,
but I guess I got carried away.

410
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:33,094
You got carried away by a comic book?

411
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,723
It was a scary comic book, Mom.
I'm sorry.

412
00:45:38,391 --> 00:45:41,519
You know, I've just about had it
with the both of you.

413
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:47,275
What is this mess?

414
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:51,029
You spill milk on the kitchen floor
and don't even bother to clean it up?

415
00:45:51,112 --> 00:45:52,113
I didn't spill it.

416
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:55,241
I can't believe you.
The refrigerator door's wide open!

417
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:57,827
Are you trying to refrigerate
the whole neighborhood?

418
00:45:57,911 --> 00:46:01,122
You know, it's not fair.
I'd like to have a personal life, too.

419
00:46:01,206 --> 00:46:02,373
Where's Michael?

420
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:04,083
He went to bed early.

421
00:46:28,191 --> 00:46:30,777
Mom? Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

422
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:33,279
In here? Are you sure you're all right?

423
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:35,448
I'm fine. It was a real scary comic,
that's all.

424
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:37,617
- Do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

425
00:46:39,786 --> 00:46:41,162
Have you been eating pizza?

426
00:46:41,246 --> 00:46:42,413
No. Why?

427
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:44,916
You smell like garlic.

428
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:29,169
Who's there?

429
00:47:32,464 --> 00:47:33,715
Hello, Thorn.

430
00:47:34,257 --> 00:47:36,801
Is that you, Thorn, making all that noise?

431
00:48:36,152 --> 00:48:37,821
I'm over here, Michael.

432
00:48:38,113 --> 00:48:40,073
What's happening to me, Star?

433
00:48:42,075 --> 00:48:44,035
What's happening to me, Star?

434
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:45,829
Oh, Michael!

435
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,541
Michael, I can't tell you.
I don't know how to help you.

436
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,709
What's happening?

437
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,920
Hi.

438
00:51:01,297 --> 00:51:03,216
Aren't we friends anymore?

439
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,551
Sure.

440
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:09,597
Does that mean we are, or...?

441
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,474
We are.

442
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:14,185
Then let's act like friends.

443
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:15,395
Let's talk.

444
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,733
Michael, take off your glasses.

445
00:51:27,073 --> 00:51:28,575
Michael, look at me.

446
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:32,078
If there's a girl...

447
00:51:32,203 --> 00:51:33,037
I'm tired, Mom.

448
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:34,539
- We could talk about...
- I'm tired.

449
00:51:34,622 --> 00:51:37,167
We can talk about anything
you want to talk about.

450
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,461
I have more serious things on my mind
than girls and school.

451
00:51:39,544 --> 00:51:40,753
Things I'm dealing with...

452
00:51:40,837 --> 00:51:42,755
Things I wouldn't understand?

453
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:57,729
Looks like I wasn't the only one
who got lucky last night.

454
00:51:59,939 --> 00:52:02,484
Did you take care of everything, Michael?

455
00:52:22,295 --> 00:52:23,254
What's the wine for?

456
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:26,257
My apology to Max for running out
on him last night.

457
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:28,802
Which, young man, you should be making.

458
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,143
I better bring this up to the house
or somebody's just gonna take it.

459
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:38,937
All right, I'll be here.

460
00:52:51,074 --> 00:52:52,700
Hi, Thorn.

461
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:02,585
Mom!

462
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,352
Honey, get in the car! Get in the car!

463
00:53:21,646 --> 00:53:25,442
<i>The dog chased my mom like the Hounds
of Hell from Vampires Everywhere.</i>

464
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:29,571
We've been aware of some very serious
vampire activity in town for a long time.

465
00:53:29,654 --> 00:53:32,240
Santa Carla has become a haven
for the undead.

466
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:34,617
As a matter of fact,
we're almost certain that...

467
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:37,954
...ghouls and werewolves
occupy high positions at City Hall.

468
00:53:38,037 --> 00:53:40,540
Kill your brother. You'll feel better.

469
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:44,586
Look, guys, my brother is not
a bloodsucker.

470
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:47,255
It says here that
if you kill the head vampire...

471
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:49,632
...all half-vampires will return to normal.

472
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:52,760
Guys, if my brother's a vampire,
believe me, he's only half.

473
00:53:52,844 --> 00:53:55,054
Does he know who the head vampire is?

474
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:56,723
No, I don't think so.

475
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,058
Then you'll have to kill him.

476
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:00,602
And if you don't...

477
00:54:01,394 --> 00:54:02,520
...we will.

478
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:07,192
It all started when my mom
went to work at Max's video store.

479
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:10,779
Max never comes in till after it's dark.

480
00:54:10,904 --> 00:54:13,573
The dog who chased my mom
this morning was his.

481
00:54:13,656 --> 00:54:17,744
Listen to this: "Vampires require
a daytime protector, a guardian...

482
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:19,788
"...to watch over them as they sleep.

483
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:23,958
"Fierce dogs, the Hounds of Hell,
are often employed for this purpose."

484
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:28,296
What happens if my mom is dating
the head vampire?

485
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,633
You could nail him and save Santa Carla.

486
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:34,719
"Truth, Justice,
the American way" triumphs.

487
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,679
Thanks to you two.

488
00:54:38,389 --> 00:54:39,891
We'll check out Max.

489
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:11,965
Smells good. When do we eat?

490
00:55:12,048 --> 00:55:14,050
I told Max eight o'clock.

491
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:15,093
Max?

492
00:55:15,176 --> 00:55:16,678
Are we going to have company again?

493
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:17,971
Again?

494
00:55:18,054 --> 00:55:21,474
You haven't had company in this house
since Mom died eight years ago.

495
00:55:21,558 --> 00:55:23,810
Right. Now we're gonna
have company again.

496
00:55:23,893 --> 00:55:27,230
Michael, Max is coming to dinner.
I'd like you to meet him.

497
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:29,023
I can't. I have plans.

498
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:30,358
Michael...

499
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:34,529
Things will change around this house
when school starts.

500
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:40,493
How you doing?
You must be Michael, right?

501
00:55:42,245 --> 00:55:44,205
And you must be Max.

502
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:54,591
Well, you're the man of the house...

503
00:55:54,757 --> 00:55:57,093
...and I'm not coming in until you invite me.

504
00:55:57,177 --> 00:55:58,470
You're invited.

505
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:00,972
Thanks very much.

506
00:56:11,024 --> 00:56:11,941
Hello.

507
00:56:12,025 --> 00:56:14,277
Oh, hi. I didn't hear you come in.

508
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:16,780
Is it okay for the guest to see the food
before dinner?

509
00:56:16,863 --> 00:56:20,450
You're thinking of the groom
not seeing the bride before the wedding.

510
00:56:20,533 --> 00:56:23,119
Oh, yeah. I always get those confused.

511
00:56:23,703 --> 00:56:25,497
Thorn sends his apologies.

512
00:56:25,663 --> 00:56:27,457
Tell him I'm walking again.

513
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,127
He promises to behave if you come back.

514
00:56:37,383 --> 00:56:38,593
Mom?

515
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:41,137
These are my dinner guests.

516
00:56:41,221 --> 00:56:43,473
Edgar and Alan. The Frog brothers.

517
00:56:44,432 --> 00:56:46,810
I didn't know you were having guests.

518
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:50,396
If we'll be in your way, we can eat
some peanut butter in the kitchen.

519
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,524
No, no, there's plenty for everybody.

520
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:56,152
Max, this is my son, Sam,
and Edgar and Alan... Frog?

521
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:00,073
Lucy, this looks terrific.

522
00:57:00,156 --> 00:57:02,075
Well, I hope it tastes good.

523
00:57:02,575 --> 00:57:04,202
Tastes wonderful.

524
00:57:05,662 --> 00:57:08,832
Boy! Somebody around here
has bad breath!

525
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,298
Nanook, would you quit breathing on me!

526
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:19,384
Nanook, get upstairs. Go on.

527
00:57:25,515 --> 00:57:27,851
You want some Parmesan cheese on that?

528
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:30,019
Yeah, Sam. Thank you very much.

529
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,939
Sam grated the cheese himself. My son.

530
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:40,113
A budding chef in the family.

531
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,079
Are you all right?

532
00:57:50,165 --> 00:57:52,125
It's not cheese, it's garlic.

533
00:57:52,459 --> 00:57:53,877
You hate garlic, don't you?

534
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,921
No, I like garlic. It's just too much...

535
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:58,965
It's raw garlic.

536
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:01,843
Garlic? How did that happen?

537
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:03,553
Guys, he likes garlic.

538
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,223
Here. Quick, drink some water!

539
00:58:08,558 --> 00:58:11,144
Sam, what's the matter with you?

540
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:12,437
Does it burn?

541
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,105
Burn? Are you nuts?

542
00:58:14,481 --> 00:58:15,899
It's freezing!

543
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:18,568
Look at your suit, Max. And your pants.

544
00:58:18,693 --> 00:58:20,653
Oh, I'm so sorry.

545
00:58:21,988 --> 00:58:22,947
Now what?

546
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:24,824
Must be a circuit breaker.

547
00:58:25,116 --> 00:58:26,117
He's not glowing.

548
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:27,952
I know. Hit the lights.

549
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:33,166
Sam! What's gotten into you tonight?

550
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:35,418
I think I know what's going on here.

551
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:36,503
You do?

552
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:37,837
Yeah.

553
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:41,132
I know what you're thinking, Sam.
But you're wrong.

554
00:58:41,216 --> 00:58:42,425
- I am?
- Yeah.

555
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:45,095
I'm not trying to replace your father...

556
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:47,138
...or steal your mother away from you.

557
00:58:47,222 --> 00:58:50,058
I would just like to be your friend.
That's all.

558
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:51,851
Good night, Lucy.

559
00:58:52,352 --> 00:58:53,603
Thanks a lot!

560
00:58:53,853 --> 00:58:55,355
I'm sorry, Mom.

561
00:58:55,605 --> 00:58:57,107
Max, I'm so sorry.

562
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,235
Major mistake.

563
00:59:02,195 --> 00:59:05,365
Our batting average isn't terrific, is it?
Zero for two.

564
00:59:05,907 --> 00:59:07,742
You were so sweet to him.

565
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:10,787
I don't know what got into him.
He's not like that.

566
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:14,499
Kids Sam's age need discipline,
otherwise they run all over you.

567
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:16,543
He doesn't run over me.

568
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:18,795
Protecting mother.

569
00:59:21,548 --> 00:59:23,049
Let's try it once more.

570
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:25,343
Dinner, my house, tomorrow night.

571
00:59:26,553 --> 00:59:28,054
- I'm cooking.
- Okay.

572
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:49,451
Where is she?

573
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:54,038
Take it easy, Michael.

574
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:56,332
Where's Star, David?

575
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:00,253
If you ever want to see Star again...

576
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:02,839
...you better come with us now.

577
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:50,386
Michael, over here.

578
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,646
You don't want to miss this.

579
01:01:23,128 --> 01:01:25,630
Initiation's over, Michael.

580
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:28,007
Time to join the club.

581
01:03:02,393 --> 01:03:04,145
Now you know what we are.

582
01:03:04,604 --> 01:03:06,356
Now you know what you are.

583
01:03:07,273 --> 01:03:09,275
You'll never grow old, Michael.

584
01:03:10,485 --> 01:03:12,445
And you'll never die.

585
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,782
But you must feed.

586
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:45,061
I wish Grandpa would stop giving me
these stupid things.

587
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:57,991
I know who I am now, Sam.

588
01:03:58,241 --> 01:03:59,742
Don't kill me, Mike!

589
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,745
I'm basically a good kid, so don't kill me!

590
01:04:03,329 --> 01:04:04,539
I can help you.

591
01:04:04,622 --> 01:04:06,875
Just tell me who the head vampire is.

592
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:09,085
I thought it was Max, but I was wrong.

593
01:04:09,169 --> 01:04:11,796
Just work with me and I can help you.
You'll be okay.

594
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,922
Michael!

595
01:04:13,673 --> 01:04:14,716
Michael!

596
01:04:16,634 --> 01:04:18,762
It's that girl from the boardwalk.
Is she one of them?

597
01:04:18,845 --> 01:04:21,473
- I have to talk to you. Can I come up?
- No!

598
01:04:22,348 --> 01:04:24,768
You shut the window and lock your door.

599
01:04:28,146 --> 01:04:29,606
She's one of them!

600
01:04:30,356 --> 01:04:33,651
And don't tell me it doesn't make her
a bad person, Mike!

601
01:04:34,652 --> 01:04:37,405
You know where David took me tonight,
don't you, Star?

602
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:38,490
Who's David?

603
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:40,617
Yes, and it's my fault.

604
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:43,870
If you hadn't met me,
if I hadn't liked you...

605
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,789
I tried to warn you.

606
01:04:45,997 --> 01:04:48,541
It was that night in the cave, wasn't it?

607
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:51,795
That wasn't wine they gave me to drink.
It was blood.

608
01:04:52,212 --> 01:04:53,505
That was David's blood.

609
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:56,091
You drank someone's blood?
Are you crazy?

610
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,802
I'm just like David now, Star.

611
01:04:58,885 --> 01:05:01,429
No, you're not. You're like Laddie and me.

612
01:05:01,513 --> 01:05:04,808
- We're not one of them...
- Until you make your first kill!

613
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:08,228
Why didn't you kill me last night?

614
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:11,397
You were supposed to be my first.

615
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,817
That's what David wanted.

616
01:05:17,278 --> 01:05:18,988
But I couldn't, Michael.

617
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:20,073
Why?

618
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:23,785
Because you care so much about me?

619
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,245
Yes, I do.

620
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:37,715
What are you doing here?
What do you want from me?

621
01:05:38,758 --> 01:05:41,803
I wanted to tell you
that it's not too late for you.

622
01:05:44,097 --> 01:05:46,850
But for me it gets
harder and harder to resist.

623
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:48,309
I'm weak.

624
01:05:48,643 --> 01:05:50,937
Why did you come here tonight, Star?

625
01:05:51,729 --> 01:05:54,274
I was hoping you would help
Laddie and me.

626
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:06,286
Star!

627
01:06:06,744 --> 01:06:09,372
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you.

628
01:06:11,124 --> 01:06:12,500
What are you doing?

629
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:14,169
I've got connections.

630
01:06:28,641 --> 01:06:30,435
Okay. Where's Nosferatu?

631
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,020
- Who?
- The Prince of Darkness.

632
01:06:32,103 --> 01:06:33,563
The night crawler. The bloodsucker.

633
01:06:33,646 --> 01:06:34,898
<i>El Vampiro.</i>

634
01:06:34,981 --> 01:06:36,816
Mike, they're here!

635
01:06:49,621 --> 01:06:52,332
Grandpa, okay if we borrow the car?

636
01:07:18,608 --> 01:07:20,235
Weapons check.

637
01:07:26,574 --> 01:07:28,076
I don't want you going down there.

638
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:29,369
I'm going.

639
01:07:29,452 --> 01:07:32,288
Look, this isn't a comic book, Sammy.
These guys are brutal killers.

640
01:07:32,372 --> 01:07:34,124
So are the Frog brothers.

641
01:07:34,874 --> 01:07:36,126
Check me.

642
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:39,420
Who'd you rather have go down there
with you? Them or me?

643
01:07:39,504 --> 01:07:42,799
If something happens down there,
I won't have the strength to protect you.

644
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:44,717
This time I'll protect you.

645
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:48,638
Even though you're a vampire,
you're still my brother.

646
01:07:49,681 --> 01:07:54,060
Listen, just so you know: If you try
to stop us, or vamp-out in any way...

647
01:07:54,227 --> 01:07:57,355
...I'll stake you without even
thinking twice about it.

648
01:07:57,439 --> 01:07:58,898
Chill out, Edgar.

649
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:04,612
Where did you say you met these guys?

650
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:09,868
Holy shit!

651
01:08:09,951 --> 01:08:11,244
Vampire hotel!

652
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:16,833
Here's one. Let's stake her!

653
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,209
Don't you touch her!

654
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:20,003
Stay away from her!

655
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:22,756
Come on, vampires have
such rotten tempers.

656
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:29,262
The rest of them have got to
be here someplace. We'll find 'em.

657
01:08:30,597 --> 01:08:31,806
Star?

658
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:36,895
- I'm taking you out of here.
- No, take Laddie first.

659
01:08:36,978 --> 01:08:37,979
Please?

660
01:08:39,898 --> 01:08:42,734
I feel a draft.
I think there's something up here.

661
01:08:42,817 --> 01:08:45,111
- Let's check it out, Sam.
- Come on.

662
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:53,495
I'll be right back, Mike.

663
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:55,747
I hope.

664
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,624
Come on, Sam, let's go.

665
01:08:57,749 --> 01:08:59,083
Move out! Move!

666
01:09:04,297 --> 01:09:05,048
Flies!

667
01:09:05,131 --> 01:09:06,424
We're on the right trail.

668
01:09:06,508 --> 01:09:09,219
Flies and the undead go together,
like bullets and guns.

669
01:09:09,302 --> 01:09:10,345
Come on!

670
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:33,660
What's that smell?

671
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:37,747
Vampires, my friend. Vampires.

672
01:09:57,767 --> 01:09:59,394
It's freezing in here.

673
01:10:03,815 --> 01:10:05,984
It looks like a dead end. Let's head back.

674
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:09,070
They must have hidden their coffins
here someplace.

675
01:10:09,529 --> 01:10:11,281
There's nothing here. Let's go, guys.

676
01:10:11,364 --> 01:10:12,407
Jesus!

677
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,792
I thought they'd be in coffins.

678
01:10:22,876 --> 01:10:24,127
That's what this cave is.

679
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,795
It's one giant coffin.

680
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:31,551
Right now they're at their most vulnerable.

681
01:10:31,634 --> 01:10:32,886
Easy pickings.

682
01:10:32,969 --> 01:10:35,054
Remember, you just have to kill the leader.

683
01:10:35,138 --> 01:10:37,140
We don't know which one he is.

684
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:39,559
I guess we'll just have to kill them all.

685
01:10:39,642 --> 01:10:43,396
Let's start with the little one.
First come, first staked.

686
01:10:43,688 --> 01:10:46,357
What was that, a little vampire humor?

687
01:10:46,733 --> 01:10:48,193
It wasn't funny.

688
01:10:53,281 --> 01:10:54,741
No!

689
01:10:55,492 --> 01:10:57,494
Good night, bloodsucker!

690
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:20,934
You're dead meat!

691
01:11:43,873 --> 01:11:45,667
Get him into the sunlight!

692
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,611
Tonight...

693
01:12:15,947 --> 01:12:17,782
Mike! Start the car!

694
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,127
- We blew it, man! We lost it!
- Shut up!

695
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:31,588
- We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
- It's not our fault.

696
01:12:31,671 --> 01:12:34,299
They pulled a mind-scramble on us!
They opened their eyes and talked!

697
01:12:34,382 --> 01:12:35,925
I'll drive.

698
01:12:36,217 --> 01:12:37,761
We don't ride with vampires.

699
01:12:37,844 --> 01:12:39,262
Fine. Stay here.

700
01:12:41,514 --> 01:12:42,932
- We do now.
- Yeah.

701
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:46,060
Come on! Sam, let's get out of here!

702
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:48,271
Burn rubber!

703
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:58,198
"Burn rubber" does not mean warp speed!

704
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:10,001
Cool it, Nanook!

705
01:13:10,084 --> 01:13:11,795
Your dog knows a flesh-eater
when he smells one.

706
01:13:11,878 --> 01:13:13,713
Take him outside, Sam.

707
01:13:14,339 --> 01:13:16,049
Come on, Nanook.

708
01:13:18,885 --> 01:13:20,011
Michael.

709
01:13:21,387 --> 01:13:24,307
Do you know the rule
about filling up the car with gas...

710
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:26,434
...when you take it without asking?

711
01:13:26,518 --> 01:13:27,894
No, Grandpa.

712
01:13:28,645 --> 01:13:29,896
Now you do.

713
01:13:39,572 --> 01:13:41,157
We definitely blew Plan A.

714
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:42,283
Time to activate Plan B.

715
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:43,952
- What's Plan B?
- We don't have one yet.

716
01:13:44,035 --> 01:13:45,829
We have two and a half hours
to come up with one.

717
01:13:45,912 --> 01:13:47,080
What happens then?

718
01:13:47,163 --> 01:13:49,833
The sun goes down.
They'll be looking for us.

719
01:13:56,756 --> 01:13:58,258
Sam, what are you doing here?

720
01:13:58,341 --> 01:14:00,844
I've got to tell you something.
It's real important.

721
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:03,263
Santa Carla is crawling with vampires.

722
01:14:03,596 --> 01:14:04,681
Mom, I'm serious!

723
01:14:04,764 --> 01:14:07,183
Edgar staked one of them.
It was screaming and fizzing!

724
01:14:07,267 --> 01:14:09,144
Look, there's evidence on my sweater!

725
01:14:09,227 --> 01:14:11,312
Mom, you've got to tell someone!

726
01:14:11,646 --> 01:14:13,940
- You've got to tell someone!
- This isn't funny!

727
01:14:14,023 --> 01:14:16,693
I'm not kidding! They're coming
to the house when it gets dark!

728
01:14:16,776 --> 01:14:18,987
Stop it! Right now! Stop it!

729
01:14:19,696 --> 01:14:21,364
- But, Mom...
- Not another word!

730
01:14:21,448 --> 01:14:22,699
I don't believe you're doing this.

731
01:14:22,782 --> 01:14:24,909
I want to see Max tonight,
and you're trying to ruin it for me.

732
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:26,119
No, I'm not.

733
01:14:26,202 --> 01:14:29,372
There's nothing wrong with Max.
I don't know why you don't want me...

734
01:14:29,456 --> 01:14:32,083
I'm not talking about Max!
To hell with Max!

735
01:14:34,419 --> 01:14:36,671
I'll deal with you later, young man!

736
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,387
Guys, we're on our own.

737
01:14:44,554 --> 01:14:46,931
Good. That's just the way we like it.

738
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:23,426
Widow Johnson called.
Said to pick her up at seven, not eight.

739
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:25,261
We've got a date tonight?

740
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:27,806
I guess so. She said not to be late.

741
01:15:28,598 --> 01:15:30,600
I better get cleaned up, then.

742
01:15:52,539 --> 01:15:54,374
Die, Mr. Vampire!

743
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:19,399
They'll be coming for Laddie and me,
won't they?

744
01:16:20,567 --> 01:16:22,652
They'll be coming for all of us.

745
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:26,281
Laddie, wake up.

746
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,233
- Oh, it's delicious.
- Thank you.

747
01:17:45,485 --> 01:17:47,028
Thorn, stop that!

748
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:50,907
What's the matter, Lucy?

749
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,409
It's just old memories coming back.

750
01:17:53,618 --> 01:17:56,246
No, seriously.
Why are you so jumpy tonight?

751
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:57,789
Well, it's something Sam...

752
01:17:57,872 --> 01:17:59,582
He came into the store...

753
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:02,544
It was just a kid's imagination,
I'm sure, but...

754
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:04,796
...he seemed so sincere, but...

755
01:18:05,672 --> 01:18:06,756
It's insane.

756
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,008
Tell me. I promise not to laugh.

757
01:18:09,342 --> 01:18:10,343
Honest.

758
01:18:15,932 --> 01:18:17,475
I think I should warn you all:

759
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:20,228
When a vampire dies,
it's never a pretty sight.

760
01:18:20,311 --> 01:18:22,856
No two bloodsuckers go out the same way.

761
01:18:23,106 --> 01:18:25,358
Some yell and scream. Some go quietly.

762
01:18:25,442 --> 01:18:27,360
Some explode. Some implode.

763
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:30,405
But all will try to take you with them.

764
01:18:47,839 --> 01:18:49,674
Nanook! I left him outside.

765
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:51,760
Don't go out there! Stop him!

766
01:18:54,304 --> 01:18:56,055
- Sam, come back!
- No way!

767
01:19:20,497 --> 01:19:22,707
Michael, they're coming!

768
01:19:25,001 --> 01:19:26,586
They're coming!

769
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,381
Hurry up, man!

770
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,813
Take them upstairs!

771
01:20:01,121 --> 01:20:03,998
- I say we terminate them right now.
- Laddie, run!

772
01:20:12,298 --> 01:20:14,008
You're mine.

773
01:20:15,218 --> 01:20:16,386
You killed Marko.

774
01:20:16,469 --> 01:20:17,846
Yeah. You're next.

775
01:20:17,929 --> 01:20:19,472
No. You're next.

776
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:27,188
Garlic don't work, boys.

777
01:20:27,272 --> 01:20:29,441
Try the holy water, death breath!

778
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:02,242
Mike, wake up.

779
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:43,825
You missed, sucker.

780
01:22:44,033 --> 01:22:45,368
Only once, pal.

781
01:23:16,065 --> 01:23:17,817
Death by stereo.

782
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,310
Hey, it's me.

783
01:23:52,393 --> 01:23:53,394
Are you okay?

784
01:23:53,478 --> 01:23:56,564
I nailed one of them downstairs
with a bow and arrow.

785
01:23:57,816 --> 01:23:59,943
We trashed the one
that looked like Twisted Sister.

786
01:24:00,026 --> 01:24:02,695
We totally annihilated
his night stalkin' ass!

787
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:05,865
And Nanook helped a little.

788
01:24:06,991 --> 01:24:08,701
Death to all vampires!

789
01:24:08,785 --> 01:24:10,245
Maximum body count.

790
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,955
We are awesome monster bashers!

791
01:24:12,038 --> 01:24:13,164
The meanest!

792
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:14,541
The baddest!

793
01:24:33,977 --> 01:24:34,936
Holy shit!

794
01:24:35,019 --> 01:24:37,355
The attack of Eddie Munster! Get him!

795
01:24:37,689 --> 01:24:40,483
Stop! Get away from him!
Just stay away from him!

796
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:42,235
He's just a little boy!

797
01:25:00,837 --> 01:25:02,922
You're afraid to face me, David?

798
01:25:09,429 --> 01:25:11,139
I tried to make you immortal.

799
01:25:11,222 --> 01:25:13,224
You tried to make me a killer!

800
01:25:23,276 --> 01:25:24,736
You are a killer.

801
01:25:47,592 --> 01:25:48,843
My turn.

802
01:25:58,061 --> 01:26:01,981
Stop fighting me, Michael.
I don't want to kill you.

803
01:26:02,982 --> 01:26:03,983
Join us.

804
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:06,111
Never!

805
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:12,158
It's too late. My blood is in your veins.

806
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:17,205
So is mine!

807
01:27:19,559 --> 01:27:21,644
Don't let them see me like this.

808
01:27:25,774 --> 01:27:27,025
Get away, Sam.

809
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:30,445
- Michael, what's wrong?
- I said, get away!

810
01:27:35,408 --> 01:27:37,994
What's the big deal?
You destroyed the head vampire.

811
01:27:38,077 --> 01:27:39,120
It's all over.

812
01:27:39,204 --> 01:27:40,663
Nothing's changed.

813
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:43,416
He's right. I don't feel any different.

814
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:45,460
Then there's still one more.

815
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:54,969
I'll handle Mom. Come on, go.

816
01:27:55,095 --> 01:27:57,013
Don't let her see the bodies.

817
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:00,433
What happened?

818
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:03,019
Where is Michael?

819
01:28:03,394 --> 01:28:05,188
What happened to your face?

820
01:28:05,396 --> 01:28:07,273
What happened to your face?

821
01:28:30,797 --> 01:28:34,592
I don't want to hear another word
from you until I talk to Michael.

822
01:28:34,801 --> 01:28:36,302
I'm sorry, Lucy.

823
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:38,555
This is all my fault.

824
01:28:39,305 --> 01:28:41,266
David and my boys misbehaved.

825
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:44,811
I told you, boys need a mother.

826
01:28:45,061 --> 01:28:47,147
Max, what are you talking about?

827
01:28:49,232 --> 01:28:51,734
I knew it! You're the head vampire!

828
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:53,695
Sam, don't start this again.

829
01:28:53,778 --> 01:28:56,406
You're the secret
that David was protecting.

830
01:28:58,116 --> 01:28:59,200
Who's this?

831
01:28:59,284 --> 01:29:00,994
But you passed the test.

832
01:29:01,995 --> 01:29:05,707
Don't ever invite a vampire
into your house, you silly boy.

833
01:29:05,957 --> 01:29:07,667
It renders you powerless.

834
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:09,753
Did you know that?

835
01:29:09,836 --> 01:29:10,920
Of course.

836
01:29:11,004 --> 01:29:12,380
Everyone knows that.

837
01:29:12,464 --> 01:29:16,134
Has everyone gone crazy?
What's the matter with all of you?

838
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,512
It was you I was after, all along, Lucy.

839
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:20,680
What?

840
01:29:20,847 --> 01:29:21,931
I knew...

841
01:29:22,849 --> 01:29:26,102
...that if I could get Sam and Michael
into the family...

842
01:29:26,519 --> 01:29:28,271
...there was no way you could say no.

843
01:29:28,354 --> 01:29:29,814
Where's Michael?

844
01:29:30,023 --> 01:29:32,525
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.

845
01:29:36,446 --> 01:29:38,615
Just like one big happy family.

846
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:42,994
Your boys...

847
01:29:44,537 --> 01:29:45,789
...and my boys.

848
01:29:45,872 --> 01:29:48,500
Great. "The Bloodsucking Brady Bunch."

849
01:29:49,876 --> 01:29:51,544
I still want you, Lucy.

850
01:29:53,713 --> 01:29:56,091
I haven't changed my mind about that.

851
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:59,010
I didn't invite you this time, Max!

852
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,845
Michael!

853
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:20,031
Don't you touch my mother!

854
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:33,128
Don't fight, Lucy.
It's so much better if you don't fight.

855
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:35,672
Mom, don't!

856
01:30:36,881 --> 01:30:39,092
Don't do it, Mom! Mom, don't do it!

857
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:39,235
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

858
01:31:59,964 --> 01:32:01,549
It's over.

859
01:32:12,352 --> 01:32:13,853
Is everybody okay?

860
01:32:22,695 --> 01:32:24,364
Oh, my boys.

861
01:32:25,031 --> 01:32:28,118
How much do you think
we should charge them for this?

862
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:36,918
Dad?

863
01:32:43,425 --> 01:32:45,135
Dad, are you all right?

864
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:54,352
One thing about livin' in Santa Carla
I never could stomach...

865
01:32:55,562 --> 01:32:57,605
All the damn vampires.
