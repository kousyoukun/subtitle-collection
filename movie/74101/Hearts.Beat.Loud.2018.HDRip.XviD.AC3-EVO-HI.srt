like she's the adult.

You know, that's just their way of making
it easier for you when they leave.

We were like
little kids together.

And that's how we got through
all that.

I have these moments
of immense pride.

The first time
she got a Groucho joke.

Stuff that reminded me
that I was her dad.

Then, eventually,
she outgrew me.

Why?

633
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:42,746
Because I know a good thing
when I see it.

I believe
in this store, Frank.

Plus, I don't think we're good
enough for an audience, anyways.

Well, when you're a doctor and
I'm still a starving artist,
