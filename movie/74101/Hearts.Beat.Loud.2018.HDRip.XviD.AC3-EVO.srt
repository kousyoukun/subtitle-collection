00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,684
I don't think
you can smoke inside.

3
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,486
Excuse me.

4
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,790
- Excuse me.
- What's that?

5
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:34,690
I don't think
you can smoke inside.

6
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:40,766
You buy something,
I'll put it out.

7
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:07,490
Hi. See that?

8
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,792
Just bought that album
on Amazon

9
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:11,363
for less money
than you charge here.

10
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,200
You're a dickhead.
Bye.

11
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,041
Okay.

12
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,247
Who can tell us some of the symptoms
of coronary artery disease?

13
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:30,413
- Sam?
- Uh, chest pain.

14
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:33,850
Yes, such as angina caused
by inadequate blood supply

15
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:36,252
to the heart muscle.
What else? Yeah.

16
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,922
Um, irregular
heartbeat, loud heartbeat.

17
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,391
Palpitations, yes,
although, loud heartbeat

18
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:44,393
is probably not a symptom
of an underlying condition.

19
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:48,267
Unless, I suppose the patient
is falling in love.

20
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,237
All right, ventricles,
let's look at those.

21
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,851
Leslie, hey!

22
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,752
Hey! How's it going, Frank?

23
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,854
It is going.

24
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,868
Looking for anything
in particular?

25
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,903
Mmm, nah, just looking.

26
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,976
What's this?
I like this.

27
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,044
Oh, this is <i>Songs: Ohia.</i>

28
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,314
It's really just this one guy,
Jason Molina.

29
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:39,416
He's amazing.
Well, he was amazing.

30
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:42,786
He died a young man
before his time,

31
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:46,055
- but he was a genius.
- Hmm.

32
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:48,328
- Yeah, its really good.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,896
This dual link vocal bit
right here...

34
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:56,769
That's my...
That's my favorite part.

35
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,603
And he wrote the song about

36
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:02,005
the woman he would
eventually marry

37
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,806
when they were
just a new couple, so,

38
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:06,445
sort of a fresh love song.

39
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,655
- You are in for a real treat.
- Oh.

40
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:19,459
Um, so listen,

41
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,026
if... If you ever have
any free time,

42
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:24,998
I was hoping we could talk
about a few things.

43
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:29,302
Well, I'm free right now.

44
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,103
Right.

45
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,341
Sure, uh...

46
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,010
Well,

47
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:41,947
I'm... I'm not gonna
be renewing.

48
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,852
I have to close the shop, Les.

49
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,621
Um...

50
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,492
Uh, okay.

51
00:04:55,494 --> 00:05:00,397
I'm sorry, Frank. I... I held off on
raising the rent as long as I could.

52
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,567
No, it's okay.
I mean, its time.

53
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,401
I've got some changes
I need to be making.

54
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:08,540
My... My girl starts UCLA
in the fall.

55
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,981
And I... I mean, 17 years

56
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:18,418
is a pretty good run.

57
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:21,353
Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:23,887
Yeah.

59
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,889
That's the big news
around these parts.

60
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,892
I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,365
I'm... I'm sorry,
I got to take this.

62
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,000
You know,
I get that she's elderly,

63
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,267
but shoplifting
is shoplifting.

64
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:42,438
I understand. She just gets a
little confused sometimes.

65
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,408
I'm sure she didn't mean
to steal anything.

66
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,411
All right, well, maybe somebody ought
to keep a closer eye on her, yeah?

67
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,081
We will, Officer. Thank you.

68
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,752
All right, Mrs. Fisher,

69
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,355
I'm gonna let you go this time

70
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:00,123
but I really don't want
to see you here again.

71
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:46,171
Hi.

72
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,473
Who made these?

73
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,445
Dustin Yellen.
This is his studio.

74
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:54,981
How does it work?

75
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:59,115
He places these tiny images
on slabs of glass

76
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:02,188
and then stacks them together
so it makes one whole piece.

77
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:05,625
It's very scientific.

78
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,461
Like a preserved person.

79
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:13,262
It's about how we each have
one self,

80
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,668
but we're all made of more
than just one thing, you know?

81
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,704
At least, that's how
I interpret it.

82
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,774
Move where?

83
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:28,980
This place is rent-controlled.
I'm not gonna move.

84
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,515
Why, do you wanna move me
into a home?

85
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:34,683
Nobody's putting you
in a home, Ma.

86
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:36,719
But...

87
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,788
Maybe you could
come and live with me

88
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,156
after Sam goes off
to school in the fall.

89
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:42,894
Move to Red Hook?

90
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,132
There are no trains
that go to Red Hook, Frank.

91
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:51,903
Well, we need to do something.

92
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,095
How's it going, kiddo?

93
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,596
Did you, um,
find my birth certificate?

94
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,899
"Hello, dear Dad, it's going great.
How are you?"

95
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:25,202
I'm serious.

96
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,603
I need it for enrollment. They
keep sending me those emails.

97
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:31,106
Um, I know it hung on
to your umbilical cord,

98
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:33,946
- I think I know where that is.
- You're not funny.

99
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,646
Not even, like,
a little bit.

100
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:37,950
I'll look for it tomorrow.

101
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,752
You smell like cigarettes.

102
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:46,057
That might be my new Axe
body spray scent, Brothel.

103
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,096
What are you doing, homework?

104
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,598
We're studying the heart
this week.

105
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,070
I hope you're hanging out with friends
or something later, at least.

106
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:00,639
They're all away
for the summer.

107
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:04,306
I just can't believe

108
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,810
you're spending your
last summer before college

109
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,213
in a pre-med class
right before you have to go

110
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,817
spend four years taking
pre-med classes.

111
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,789
By which I mean, I'm very
proud of your work ethic.

112
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,095
Do you know how hard it is for an incoming
freshman to get a research position?

113
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:27,165
No.

114
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,968
I'm being prepared.

115
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,772
Plus I enjoy this.
This is fun for me.

116
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:38,174
Well, it's clearly got you
in a terrific mood.

117
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,410
Can I help you
with something or...

118
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:44,150
Yeah. Are you not watching the clock?
It's jam sesh time.

119
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,751
- No.
- Come on!

120
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,753
- Come on, you haven't jammed with me for a long time.
- Dad, come on. I'm studying.

121
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:53,823
- Please. Come on.
- No. I'm doing something.

122
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,791
- Not right now.
- I understand.

123
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,826
When jam sesh time arrives,

124
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:01,263
we have to put aside childish things,
like homework and med school.

125
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,300
- Please don't touch my things.
- Well, its time for jam sesh.

126
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,272
Dad, I don't want
to jam with you.

129
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:19,348

Earlier today.

160
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,480
You can't make your
heart feel like what?

161
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:38,984
I don't know.

162
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,353
Well, try and think about it.

163
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,956
You can't make your heart
feel like what?

164
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,528
Full, I guess,

165
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,331
like some of it's missing.

166
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,908
"Speak now.
Streets are flooded.

167
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,445
"Hearts loud, we feel it
in our blood.

168
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:12,281
"And now our hearts
beat loud."

169
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:15,584
Its just a bunch of words.

170
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:17,987
I'm not even sure
it means anything.

171
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:19,458
Meaning, shmeaning.

172
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:21,427
"I want it that way."

173
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,127
They want what?
What way?

174
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,262
- It doesn't matter...
- Wait, I'm sorry.

175
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:30,266
Are you bringing up the Backstreet
Boys in reference to my lyrics?

176
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,701
With all due respect, it's
actually a pretty good song.

177
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,570
- Hmm.
- Oh, come on!

178
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,940
How did you get to be
such a music snob?

179
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,574
I wonder.

180
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:42,281
This is a mood piece.
It just has to have a feeling.

181
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,917
This has feeling.

I'm off to work.

215
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,790
- No.
- Come on. That was amazing.

216
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,161
You've been trying to start a
band with me since I was like 12.

217
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:22,198
Yes and as great as Sandwich
<i>und</i> Frank could have been,

218
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,601
we are legit,
so much way better now.

219
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,171
But we should probably come up
with a cooler name.

220
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,709
- We're not a band.
- We're Not A Band?

221
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,479
I like it.

222
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:35,270
What are you staring at?

223
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,176
Oh, I just get lost
in that sometimes.

224
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,413
You were
so devilishly handsome.

225
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,182
Yeah, I was.

226
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,783
Where have you been?

227
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:50,253
I was with my new person.

228
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,592
- Your new person?
- Hmm. My new marijuana person.

229
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,792
It's incredible.

230
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:02,297
He shows up once a week and he
says he's here to fix my computer.

231
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:05,736
- You don't have a computer.
- I know.

232
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,441
The computer is my brain,
don't you get it?

233
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:15,311
He's here to fix my brain.

234
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:18,650
- Did you happen to smoke some with your new person?
- Yep.

235
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,718
- You want some?
- No.

236
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,456
I would like another beer.

237
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,793
Okie-dokie.

238
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,894
Phew! Once in a lifetime.

239
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:37,903
- What?
- I mean, I was in other productions,

240
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:40,938
just not on Broadway.

241
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,807
But you know,

242
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,312
we don't always get
to do what we love, Frankie,

243
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,351
so we need to try to love
what we do.

244
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:56,485
I guess I never realized
that was your secret.

245
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,086
Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.

246
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,523
- It's not a bad crowd for a week night.
- Right.

247
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,326
Right. Well, we are
a destination for young people

248
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:07,363
who are looking for a taste
of the real Red Hook.

249
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:10,032
- Says who?
- <i>New York</i> magazine.

250
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:13,839
Whoop-dee-doo.
How you doing at your end?

251
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,842
The landlady
has been notified.

252
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,679
That's tough.

253
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:25,316
Really hasn't hit me yet.

254
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:30,621
Although, sometimes
change is good.

255
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,391
I feel like maybe you're
not the best judge of that,

256
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:37,296
having been here
for 30 years.

257
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:40,532
I just...

258
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,403
I just got a new person today.

259
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:52,076
- Touche.
- Thank you.

260
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,925
You still got it, buddy.

261
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:02,814
<i>Your Best American Girl.</i>

262
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,881
That's definitely not me.

263
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:08,487
You know, that's exactly why
you have to listen to it.

264
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:13,492
You know, she just gets it.

265
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,959
Okay, I will.

266
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,631
I'll listen to it.

267
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,501
This is a dead end?

268
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:28,506
Yeah, this is a part
where I kidnap you

269
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:30,605
- and tie you up.
- Oh.

270
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,174
That's not how I meant it.

271
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,447
Good one.

272
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,962
So why UCLA?

273
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,937
I've been here my whole life.

274
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,673
I want something different.

275
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:05,477
It's time to get away.

276
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:09,047
You came here
to get away.

277
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:11,883
I get it.

278
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,053
But it's not New York.

279
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,491
I know.

280
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,578

I got you a present.

How much money
did you spend on this?

287

You said you needed a sampler?
So sample this.

291
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,732
Dad, we can't afford this.
How did you even pay for this?

292
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:39,367
I put it on the credit card.
What do you care?

293
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:41,272
You keep telling me
we don't have any money.

294
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,606
We can't keep this stuff.

295
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:46,211
It's for the band.

296
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,580
There's no band.

297
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:53,782
You have to grow up, okay?

298
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:55,683
I don't want to be
in a band.

299

Okay, I'll take them back.

302
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,139
Okay.

Here you go. Bye.

304
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:40,161
- Frank.
- Callie, my dear, how are you?

305
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:43,665
Same old.
Usual for you?

306
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,104
Actually, do you, uh, do you know
what kind of whoopie pie Sam likes?

307
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:51,675
- Strawberry.
- Give me two of those.

308
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,809
- Okay.
- Please.

309
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:57,147
Go ahead and throw a classic
in there for me, too.

310

Okay. Here we go.

311
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,200
What... What is this?

312
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,469
- Are you playing this?
- What?

313
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:24,373
The song, what... How...
What are we listening to?

314
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,877
Oh, oh, I don't know.
Just some mix.

315
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,649
What mix?

316
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:33,151
Um, I can find out.

317
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:42,160
It's um, new indie mix
on Spotify.

318
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:46,865
Can I... Can I see that?

319
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,269
This... This is my band.

320
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:56,173
This is me.
That's Sam singing. This...

321
00:27:57,741 --> 00:27:59,807
- Its cool.
- How the hell did this get on here?

322
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:01,375
Listen, look at this.

323
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:03,344
That's our song right there.
<i>Hearts Beat Loud.</i>

324
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:04,947
- We're Not A Band.
- Its cool.

325
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:08,750
You guys, this is my band.
This tune, you can hear it?

326
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:15,292
What? What? How?

327
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:19,294
Can you? Can you?

328
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:21,365
No. This is my band!

329
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,451
What's up!
I got you whoopie pies.

330
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:41,753
Cool.

331
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:43,951
And then you ran here
with them?

332
00:28:43,953 --> 00:28:45,286
- Go to Spotify.
- No.

333
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,256
- Sam do it.
- That's weird.

334
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,923
- I got to show you something.
- No.

335
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:51,325
- Go to Spotify. Sam do it.
- I'm doing something.

336
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,961
Sam go to Spotify and check
out the new indie mix.

337
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:56,400
- Just for once do what your father says.
- Okay.

338
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,339
- What am I looking for?
- Just keep looking.

339
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:08,442
What...

340
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:10,144
- What is this?
- I don't know.

341
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:11,348
I don't know. Play it.

342
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:20,824
Did you put our song
on Spotify?

343
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,426
What?
We are real.

344
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:26,995
This is real.
We're the real deal, kiddo.

345
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:31,201
We are on a playlist with
Iron & Wine and Spoon. Boom!

346
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:35,539
Whoopie pies and Spotify.

347
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:41,910
I gotta get to the shop.
We're Not A Band, baby!

348
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:12,376
Oh, my famous daughter,
everyone.

349
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:16,210
Dude, what you did was wrong.

350
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:17,880
Sorry, wrong?

351
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,016
Dad, you did it without asking,
without my permission.

352
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:22,886
I mean, I could sue you.

353
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,255
That would be
an excellent idea.

354
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,489
"Daughter sues father
over hit song."

355
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:32,361
- It's not... Not a hit song.
- No?

356
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:36,500
There could be like 50,000 people
today listening to our song. Today.

357
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:41,202
I guess.
So what do we do now?

358
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:43,340
Okay. Let's see.

359
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,445
You said, uh,
there is no band.

360
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:50,278
So...

361
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,450
I guess that's it. I guess
we don't do anything now.

362
00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:57,454
I mean, we could
write another song.

363
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,355
In fact, now that we are
having this open dialogue,

364
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,257
I wanted to show you something
I found the other day

365
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:04,593
when I was looking
for your birth certificate.

366
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:07,228
- Wait, you found my birth certificate?
- Oh, yeah.

367
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,363
- Oh, sorry.
- Dude!

368
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,565
Um, I meant to tell you
about it.

369
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,436
I'm sorry.
It's at... It's at home.

370
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:16,371
This is my old notebook.

371
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:19,240
Its full of lyrics and words
and poems.

372
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:21,543
You have
a book of poems?

373
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:25,613
- Yeah.
- That's a poem, by you?

374
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:28,552
That, excuse you,
is a song.

375
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:31,385
It's our new song.

376
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:43,601

That's about Mom.

404
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:30,167
Yeah, and you.

405
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,677
It's a really good song, Dad.

406
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,664
This is
a very thoughtful gesture.

407
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:04,932
I feel so awful
about the store closing.

408
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:08,302
It's the least I could do.
You deserve a nice dinner.

409
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:12,809
Well, thank you for doing the least you
can do because this is really great.

410
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,878
And you look really nice,
tonight, Les.

411
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,483
Aw, thanks.

412
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:20,315
So do you.

413
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:22,487
It's my button shirt.

414
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:29,527
To Red Hook Records.

415
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:33,363
To Red Hook Records.

416
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:45,539
Am I crazy
or do you seem cheerful?

417
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,177
No, Sam and I are working
on a...

418
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:50,248
Project.
It's going pretty well.

419
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,713
Yeah?

420
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:55,816
We're actually writing
some songs together.

421
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:57,719
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

422
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,525
I mean, she has got chops.

423
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,358
She's got a voice, too.

424
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,992
I'm not surprised
to hear that.

425
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:06,931
Well, she doesn't get it
from me.

426
00:36:07,931 --> 00:36:10,365
She's leaving soon, right?

427
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,266
I remember when Jack
went to college,

428
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:14,538
he could not get away from me
fast enough.

00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:32,917
Whoo!

445
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:14,722
Sam talks to me now
like she's the adult.

446
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:17,728
You know, that's just their way of making
it easier for you when they leave.

447
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:20,494
So you don't miss 'em
so much.

Being total assholes.

449
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,569
Jack did it to me.

450
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:28,403
I did it to my parents.

451
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:31,905
God, I was a monster. You don't
know how easy you have it.

452
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:34,511
Yeah, I know.

453
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:38,983

after Dani...

455
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:47,425
We were like
little kids together.

456
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:51,929
And that's how we got through
all that.

457
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,601
I have these moments
of immense pride.

458
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:01,338
The first time
she got a Groucho joke.

459
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,943
Stuff that reminded me
that I was her dad.

460
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:13,750
Then, eventually,
she outgrew me.

461
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,019
That's what happens.

462

00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:32,693
This is serious.

473
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:35,932
There's rum that needs to be
properly savored.

474
00:40:37,032 --> 00:40:39,666
It's the real deal, Leslie.

475
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,635
Got it from my guy in Mexico.

476
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:43,871
Wow. Is your guy,
George Clooney?

477
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:46,173
I never reveal my sources.

478
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:49,177
This is what we call
the good stuff.

479
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:52,650
Right? It's like... It's like life.
You know you gotta

480
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:55,652
slow down and enjoy it.

481
00:40:57,686 --> 00:40:58,788
Won't you join us?

482
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,525
Yeah, you know...

483
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:04,161
I think I will.

484
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,597
Now, this stuff.
This stuff.

485
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,669
Ah.

486
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:14,003
That's so good.

487
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:15,905
Excuse me.

488
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:21,742
He's an Aquarius.

489
00:41:21,744 --> 00:41:23,614
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

490
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:28,052
- Mmm.
- Leslie?

491
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:30,617
- Ryan!
- Hey!

492
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,920
Hey! Oh.

493
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:37,060
- What you doing down here?
- Oh, we're just having a nightcap.

494
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,094
This is my friend, Frank.

495
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,764
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hi, there.

496
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,333
Uh, Frank is my...

497
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:48,202
- Tenant.
- Uh, cool.

498
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:49,773
One of my tenants.

499
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:53,210
Yes, she is my landlady.

500
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,012
Uh, well, it's nice
to meet you, Frank.

501
00:41:59,014 --> 00:42:01,282
- I'll see you around, Leslie.
- Yeah, see you soon.

502
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:03,287
Take her easy.

503
00:42:14,797 --> 00:42:18,766
When submitting your show
history to Mercury Lounge,

504
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:23,673
please be as specific as possible and
please do not exaggerate your draw.

505
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:25,140
Show history?

506
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:29,776
I think we can exaggerate
that a little.

507
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:32,613
It specifically says
not to exaggerate.

508
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:34,117
It says don't exaggerate
your draw.

509
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:36,987
We don't have a draw, either.

510
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:39,623
I'm gonna say our draw is 60.

511
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:43,092
No. 65.

512
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,834
No, it's faster than that.
Double time.

513
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:56,306
- Okay.
- And one, two, three, four.

514
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:01,778
Now, double the length.

515
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:18,925
Was that right?

516
00:43:18,927 --> 00:43:21,632
I... I don't know
what kind of song I'm writing.

517
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,135
It's a love song.

518
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:26,737
No, it's not.

519
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:29,940
I think your lyrics
would disagree with you,

520
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,238
my dear.

521
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,309
Every song
is a love song, technically.

522
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:39,115
Uh, <i>The Shah Sleeps in Lee Harvey's
Grave</i> by the Butthole Surfers?

523
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:40,850
Not a love song.

524
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,288
This is definitely
a love song.

525
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:47,958
But a love song
for who exactly?

526
00:43:49,324 --> 00:43:50,660
Whom.

527
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:52,295
For whom.

528
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:57,365
"Wanna burn your memory
in the back of my mind.

529
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:00,204
"So I see your face
when I close my eyes"?

530
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:03,706
A, that's awesome.

531
00:44:04,907 --> 00:44:07,176
B, there's a lot of love
in there.

532
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:14,684
You have a girlfriend?

533
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,155
- Boyfriend?
- Dad.

534
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:24,360
Stop.

535
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,343
I have a girlfriend.

536
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:43,447
Her name is Rose.

537
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:46,282
She's an artist.

538
00:44:47,382 --> 00:44:48,083
Um...

539
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,188
She's cool, I like her.
A lot.

540
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:55,021
And it's...

541
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:58,127
Been great, but also,
it isn't.

542
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:00,463
How so?

543
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:06,236
It's all in the song.

544
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:11,942
That's good.

545
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,879
When life
hands you conundrums,

546
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:17,947
you turn 'em into art.

547
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,043
It's good soup, Grandma.

548
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,911
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

549
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:27,014
Mmm, I just like to sit here
and just slurp my soup.

550
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:31,519
It's a perfect meal
for a hot summer night.

551
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:33,356
Okay, wise guy.

552
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,860
- So, you still singing?
- Mmm-hmm.

553
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:38,961
Sometimes.

554
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:41,628
I know when I was your age,

555
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,398
I would go from nightclub
to nightclub.

556
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,235
Just trying,
trying to get a singing gig.

557
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:49,871
But that's what
you had to do then.

558
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,405
You took your act
from door to door

559
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:53,076
And you had to show 'em... You
had to show 'em your stuff.

560
00:46:55,545 --> 00:47:00,548
And then one day, I walked into this club
in Long Island, It was the Three of Hearts.

561
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:04,521
And the... And the owner said he didn't like
the look of me but could I carry a tune?

562
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:11,492
Well, I just belted out a couple of...
a couple of bars of <i>All Of Me.</i>

563
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:13,561
And he knew, he knew.

564
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:15,432
They put me on the stage
that very night.

565
00:47:20,335 --> 00:47:22,538
Then afterwards,
this handsome man came up.

566
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:25,042
And he said, "You...

567
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,913
"Have the most beautiful
voice I've ever heard."

568
00:47:32,047 --> 00:47:34,116
I could tell by his eyes,
he meant it.

569
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:37,855
It was my Eddie.

570
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,992
Your grandfather.

571
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,364
I really like that story.

572
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,933
Yeah, he was shorter than me
but I didn't mind.

573
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:53,936
Gram!

574
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,039
That's true.

575
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:32,074
Hey. Ha!

576
00:48:35,277 --> 00:48:36,978
I just don't think this is
gonna cut it for you, Frank.

577
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,481
I know, but this is income.

578
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:43,483
Also my meat and cheese background
is really strong, so...

579
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:45,489
I think I got
a pretty good chance.

580
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:51,592
Okay, listen. I've... I've actually
been wanting to talk to you

581
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:54,998
because um, I've been thinking
about something and...

582
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:57,967
I have a proposition for you.

583
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:02,369
Okay, so, what if
we brightened it up in here?

584
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:06,706
You know, get some cool, new
wood-paneled record bins and...

585
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,543
I don't know. Reorganize,
fix the flow.

586
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:13,517
Make it feel open and fresh
and clean.

587
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:15,548
I don't know.

588
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,651
I like to think my flow
is super fresh.

589
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:23,523
I like... I like the certain
patina that I've developed.

590
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:26,462
We could clear out this area over
here, put a barista in there.

591
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:29,729
I do like coffee.

592
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:32,233
It'll be a fresh start. We
can draw up a business plan

593
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,668
- and a rebranding strategy.
- "We"?

594
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,974
Partners. 50-50.

595
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:41,041
Why?

596
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:42,746
Because I know a good thing
when I see it.

597
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,713
I believe
in this store, Frank.

598
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:47,550
And honestly, I think it
has a lot of potential.

599
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,494
- This is so good!
- Really?

600
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:00,760
You wrote this?

601
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:05,701
Uh, yeah.
I did. With my dad.

602
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:09,702
- Frank?
- Yes.

603
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:13,273
I gotta say, I was a little worried
when you asked me to listen to it.

604
00:50:13,275 --> 00:50:15,111
Oh, what? You thought
I was gonna suck?

605
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:18,711
Yeah.

606
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:20,282
Would you tell me?

607
00:50:21,617 --> 00:50:24,021
I mean, I would be out that door.

608
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:30,090
My dad was in a band
with my mom

609
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:31,627
before I was born.

610
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:35,465
So, obviously this is...

611
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:38,634
More his thing.

612
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:42,538
Plus, I don't think we're good
enough for an audience, anyways.

613
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,414
You gotta be brave
before you can be good.

614
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:54,718
What is that?

615
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,621
I read it in a comic book.

616
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:02,558
You are brave, though.

617
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:05,262
And you're good.

618
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:12,068
I just think
it's so unrealistic.

619
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,106
All dreams are unrealistic.

620
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:19,139
My dreams are real.

621
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:21,641
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

622
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:24,644
I'm actually
gonna go to school.

623
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:26,750
And then study really hard.

624
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,751
Graduate.

625
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:31,754
And then be a doctor.

626
00:51:34,856 --> 00:51:38,325
Well, when you're a doctor and
I'm still a starving artist,

627
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,760
you can give me some free
medical care.

628
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:43,165
- I will.
- Good.

629
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:29,146
Let's do something fun
tomorrow.

630
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:31,815
Okay.

631
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,351
Like what?

632
00:52:37,753 --> 00:52:39,256
Let's bike down
to Coney Island.

633
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:48,431
I don't have a bike.

634
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:51,600
Well, I can get you a bike.

635
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,878
Shit, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

636
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,249
No, it's okay.

637
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:08,784
No, don't be sorry, um...

638
00:53:10,385 --> 00:53:11,588
I should...

639
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:14,190
...know how to ride a bike
by now.

640
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:18,294
But it's stupid.

641
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:20,797
It's not stupid.

642
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:18,655
Are you Frank Fisher?

643
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:21,755
Yes.

644
00:54:21,757 --> 00:54:23,860
Of the band, We're Not A Band?

645
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:27,297
Yes.

646
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,929
I'm Joe.

647
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:48,684
Yeah, you cracked the hook.

648
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:51,320
It's good, right?

649
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:52,956
Yeah.

650
00:54:57,893 --> 00:54:59,959
- What?
- Oh, me?

651
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:04,630
So, a gentleman came by the shop today

652
00:55:04,632 --> 00:55:07,336
from a little outfit
called Silly Bird Records,

653
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:09,505
and he wants to rep us.

654
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:12,873
He thinks the song
is great, Sam.

655
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,077
He thinks,
you are the real deal.

656
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:19,412
He wants us to cut an EP,
maybe even go on tour.

657
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:21,382
Can you believe this?

658
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,150
He said...
He said to me,

659
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:26,423
"We can really monetize this
thing if we do it properly."

660
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:31,861
I thought you'd be excited.

661
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:35,331
Dude, I leave in like a week.

662
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:41,905
Dad, I can't stay and record
an EP with you.

663
00:55:43,539 --> 00:55:44,741
Why not?

664
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,910
Seriously?

665
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,943
Are you suggesting that
I don't go to college

666
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:53,016
so that I can stay
and be in a band with you?

667
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:54,914
I don't know, uh...

668
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,786
No, not, not go, but...

669
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:02,588
I thought, maybe you could take a
year off and we'll see what happens.

670
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,360
You were in a band
20 years ago and had a deal.

671
00:56:06,594 --> 00:56:07,629
Where's your hit record?

672
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:11,033
We're just another band.

673
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:13,803
Okay, I'm...

674
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,802
Going to be a doctor.

675
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:17,570
Our band is going
somewhere, Sam.

676
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:19,708
Going somewhere? Do you
hear yourself right now?

677
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:21,941
The shop is closing.

678
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:23,980
You don't have a job.
You're broke.

679
00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:26,746
So, what?

680
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:28,949
We're just gonna leave Grandma
in her apartment, alone?

681
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:30,983
While we go on tour
and become rock stars?

682
00:56:30,985 --> 00:56:32,154
Okay.
Okay!

683
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,092
You know what?

684
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:38,825
Forget me.

685
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:39,929
Because yeah, me?

686
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,898
I am just another band.

687
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,599
But you?

688
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:49,603
Do you know how many people
would kill to have

689
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:52,972
even an ounce of the talent
that you have?

690
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:56,909
This is not something that you just give
up. Not when all of this is happening.

691
00:56:56,911 --> 00:56:58,244
Nothing is happening!

692
00:56:58,246 --> 00:57:00,079
I'm not giving anything up!

693
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:03,083
You have the same thing inside
you that your mother had.

694
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:07,119
And if she were here,
right now...

695
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:08,457
No, you don't get to do that.

696
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:15,030
She would say
the same damn thing!

697
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:23,772
Can I get another shot?

698
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,208
You...

699
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,677
You like owning
your own place, Dave?

700
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:34,981
Yeah, I do. Sometimes, it's
a pain in the ass but...

701
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:36,219
Yeah, I like it.

702
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:38,854
Good for you, Dave.

703
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:45,862
And here's to less pain in the ass
for me because my ass would be...

704
00:57:46,728 --> 00:57:48,730
Pain-free from here on out.

705
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:53,967
Yeah, I'm...

706
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:56,603
Starting to have second thoughts
about giving you this whiskey.

707
00:57:56,605 --> 00:57:58,608
Just pour me the shot, Doctor.
Last one.

708
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:15,188
You know how much a year at UCLA cost?
Speaking of doctors.

709
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,222
Mmm.

710
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:18,224
$62,000.

711
00:58:18,226 --> 00:58:19,992
Whoa!

712
00:58:19,994 --> 00:58:22,262
I mean, we're just
paying 12,000.

713
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:25,268
That's what they call a great
financial aid package.

714
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,739
Don't have a dime
to your name? 12,000 bucks.

715
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:34,575
Well, think of it this way.

716
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,513
You know,
after all that money's spent,

717
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:39,516
she's gonna end up being
a doctor.

718
00:58:47,255 --> 00:58:49,289
One more time.

719
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,961
- You said last one on the last one.
- Come on, man.

720
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:59,602
This is not a professional
relationship, Frankie.

721
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,637
I'm your friend.

722
00:59:21,956 --> 00:59:23,159
Frank, what's up?

723
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:26,596
What am I to you, anyway?

724
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,329
Sorry?

725
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:32,298
I don't know. I mean,
you see potential here?

726
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,003
I'm a business opportunity?

727
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,106
You're my friend.

728
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:39,708
We're friends.

729
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:41,844
Friends.

730
00:59:43,177 --> 00:59:44,614
Right, we're friends.

731
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,719
Don't they say you should never
go into business with a friend?

732
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:53,787
I've thought about your proposal.

733
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:56,255
- Frank.
- I thought it over and the answer is no.

734
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:58,825
I think maybe we should have
this conversation another time.

735
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:00,661
No, I wanna have it now.

736
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:04,430
The store isn't failing
because I need a barista

737
01:00:04,432 --> 01:00:05,632
to make it smell like coffee.

738
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:08,304
The store is failing 'cause I
don't wanna do it anymore.

739
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:10,807
I don't wanna sell music.

740
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:16,742
So...

741
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:18,181
Cold cuts and cheese for me.

742
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:22,351
Well, that's admirable.

743
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:26,289
You're goddamn right, it is.

744
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:30,793
What about Ryan?

745
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,026
Okay, I think you should
go home now.

746
01:00:34,028 --> 01:00:35,829
Why?
We don't wanna wake up Ryan?

747
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:37,233
Good night, Frank.

748
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:45,771
Hey, well, at least
we're still friends, right?

749
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:57,090
Her belongings.

750
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:58,590
Sir, I need her to take it.

751
01:04:58,592 --> 01:04:59,592
I'm the son.

752
01:04:59,594 --> 01:05:00,663
But she paid the bail.

753
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,165
Thank you.

754
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:05,934
Thanks.

755
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:08,503
Leslie, I'm so sorry...

756
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,603
I'm gonna pay you back.

757
01:05:10,605 --> 01:05:12,440
It's fine. I'm more than
happy to help your mom.

758
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:14,510
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

759
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,292
What are you doing up?

760
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:31,960
Waiting for you.

761
01:05:32,626 --> 01:05:35,028
It's 2:30.

762
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,595
You're supposed to call if you're
gonna be out past midnight.

763
01:05:36,597 --> 01:05:38,999
I was hanging with Rose,
my phone died...

764
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,501
Hey, lower your voice.
Your grandmother's here.

765
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:42,972
She's sleeping
in my room.

766
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:46,108
Is everything okay?

767
01:05:47,608 --> 01:05:48,610
It's fine.

768
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:01,557
I learned to ride
a bike today.

769
01:06:07,728 --> 01:06:08,730
Rose taught me.

770
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:19,641
I need you to call

771
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:23,578
if you're gonna be late,
or at least text me.

772
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:27,483
As long as you're here,
the house rules still apply.

773
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,492
Good night.

774
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:55,441
Hey, I'm sorry I wasn't around
to help out the other night.

775
01:06:55,443 --> 01:06:56,708
If I'd been in town,
you know...

776
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:58,079
Oh, no. It's okay.

777
01:06:58,679 --> 01:06:59,581
I worked it out.

778
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:05,054
So, what'd you do
up in Woodstock?

779
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:08,090
I smoked a bunch of weed.

780
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,793
Sounds nice.

781
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,294
It was.

782
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:17,400
There are trees there, man.
Just...

783
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,270
I've heard that.

784
01:07:23,637 --> 01:07:25,040
How can I help, Frank?

785
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,211
You know...

786
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,750
Every now and then, Frankie,

787
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,621
we have to accept
our circumstances

788
01:07:39,753 --> 01:07:41,656
and adapt accordingly.

789
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:46,492
Pretty wise words

790
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:48,293
from a guy who went
all the way to Woodstock

791
01:07:48,295 --> 01:07:49,664
to smoke a bunch of weed.

792
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:53,269
There were trees there, Frank.

793
01:07:54,835 --> 01:07:57,105
I went for the trees, buddy.

794
01:07:59,773 --> 01:08:01,676
Hey, you know what?
You're gonna be all right.

795
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:25,201
Hey.

796
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:27,136
Hey.

797
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:02,904
Dad, you can't sell this
for $3.

798
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:17,752
This sucks.

799
01:09:21,355 --> 01:09:22,824
You're telling me.

800
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:34,837
Hey, Les,
it's Frank. Um...

801
01:09:35,936 --> 01:09:38,271
I was just thinking
about you

802
01:09:38,273 --> 01:09:41,610
because today is the last day
of Red Hook Records.

803
01:09:42,844 --> 01:09:45,447
Just wanted to say
that I'm sorry

804
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,217
for everything.

805
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:52,453
I know that I am a jerk,

806
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,890
and, uh...

807
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,694
I hope that you will
forgive me.

808
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:03,455
Hey, I just thought
of something.

809
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:05,027
- Okay.
- You know the <i>Titanic?</i>

810
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:07,527
That's cheery.

811
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,331
There was a band
that was playing

812
01:11:10,998 --> 01:11:12,467
while it was sinking.

813
01:11:36,524 --> 01:11:39,892
- Who's playing?
- Uh, they're called We're Not A Band.

814
01:11:39,894 --> 01:11:41,396
Cool. How are they?

815
01:11:41,895 --> 01:11:42,898
Um...

816
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:48,069
They're uh, new,
they're new.

817
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:51,070
Okay. Well,

818
01:11:51,072 --> 01:11:53,742
I can't really stick around,
but I like the name.

819
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:55,744
C-Cool.

820
01:12:06,988 --> 01:12:08,754
You're gonna ask
debit or credit,

821
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:10,555
and slide it in
the chip thing,

822
01:12:10,557 --> 01:12:13,092
and it'll give you
a receipt.

823
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:14,930
Hmm. Got it.
Super easy.

824
01:12:18,432 --> 01:12:19,932
I'm really glad you're here.

825
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:22,338
Mmm! Me too.

826
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,792
Let's just do our thing.

827
01:12:46,961 --> 01:12:49,762
What thing?
We've never done this before.

828
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:51,964
I mean,
not in front of people.

829
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:54,032
Cool. Let's just do
what we always do.

830
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:56,438
Just in front of some people.

831
01:12:57,604 --> 01:12:58,973
Hey, that's what
bands do, right?

832
01:13:08,082 --> 01:13:08,917
Hello.

833
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:11,086
Hi.

834
01:13:11,953 --> 01:13:13,455
Uh, thank you all
for coming out.

835
01:13:15,622 --> 01:13:17,826
So, this store, um,

836
01:13:18,993 --> 01:13:22,495
it came about
because I love music.

837
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:25,130
My whole family
loves music.

838
01:13:25,132 --> 01:13:27,935
And so, we opened this shop

839
01:13:29,069 --> 01:13:31,974
almost 17 years ago
because of that very fact.

840
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:34,976
What's up, Lance?

841
01:13:35,476 --> 01:13:36,741
Where's your Brian Eno?

842
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,948
Um, 17 years is...

843
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,952
It's hard to believe.

844
01:13:45,185 --> 01:13:47,555
Um, anyway,

845
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:51,492
I'm gonna be very sad
to see it go.

846
01:13:54,662 --> 01:13:57,432
But all things must change,
and uh...

847
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,437
Well, that is,
that is life.

848
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:10,212
But thank you all for coming.

849
01:14:11,112 --> 01:14:12,514
All six of you.

850
01:14:14,548 --> 01:14:16,518
This is my daughter Sam.

851
01:14:18,286 --> 01:14:19,552
Hi.

852
01:14:19,554 --> 01:14:23,054
And we just decided that we're
gonna play you some songs.

853
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:26,726
So, we are
We're Not A Band.

854
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,497
Whoo!

855

883
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,155
We have to do your love song.

884
01:17:09,023 --> 01:17:11,223
Huh? It's not ready yet.

885
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:13,291
Of course, it's ready.
It's now or never.

886
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:14,259
We don't have
that many songs.

887
01:17:14,261 --> 01:17:16,361
Dad, let's just do
<i>Everything Must Go.</i>

888
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:17,830
But that's our big finale.

889
01:17:17,832 --> 01:17:19,298
<i>Everything Must Go</i>
is our big finale.

890
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,336
Are you really not
gonna play this song?

891
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:24,840
Sam. Sam.

892
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,777
You have to play the song.

893
01:17:44,992 --> 01:17:50,265
Um, this next song is called
<i>Blink One Million Miles.</i>

894
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:54,366

Thank you. Thank you so
much for coming out.

927
01:21:16,537 --> 01:21:20,275
I think this might be
our last song.

928
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:25,443
We have not been a band
for very long.

929
01:21:25,445 --> 01:21:30,551
Um, but this is
a very special song.

930
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:32,888
It's about this place

931
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:35,657
and, um...

932
01:21:38,024 --> 01:21:39,927
Well, lots of other things.

933
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:43,398

Sam Fisher,
ladies and gentlemen.

954
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:54,095
My dad.

955
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:21,620
How's it going, guys?

956
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:25,456
Rose, thank you for keeping
the ship afloat.

957
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:27,261
Or I guess helping it sink.

958
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:29,660
You know what I'm trying
to say.

959
01:24:29,662 --> 01:24:31,330
I'm trying to say thank you
for coming.

960
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:33,568
No worries. I'd do
anything for this girl.

961
01:24:34,768 --> 01:24:36,337
That makes the two of us.

962
01:24:39,273 --> 01:24:41,643
Sleater Kinney's <i>Dig Me Out.</i>

963
01:24:43,176 --> 01:24:44,679
Excellent choice.

964
01:24:46,579 --> 01:24:47,681
Thank you for coming.

965
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:51,152
I mean,

966
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:54,189
you guys are amazing.

967
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:57,125
What about Sam?

968
01:24:57,791 --> 01:24:59,594
- What about Sam?
- Ah.

969
01:25:04,664 --> 01:25:06,330
This is probably
my last chance

970
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:08,200
to show off my skills

971
01:25:08,202 --> 01:25:10,204
as a purveyor
of pressed vinyl.

972
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:19,343
Do you know Animal Collective?

973
01:25:19,345 --> 01:25:20,714
Mmm-mmm.

974
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:25,517
No? You have to own
this album.

975
01:25:25,519 --> 01:25:27,352
Look at it. Just look at it.

976
01:25:27,354 --> 01:25:29,521
- Okay.
- It moves.

977
01:25:29,523 --> 01:25:31,822
Holy shit. It really moves.

978
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:33,192
My God, that's trippy.

979
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:34,329
Wait till you hear it.

980
01:25:56,817 --> 01:25:58,252
I don't want you to go.

981
01:26:01,221 --> 01:26:02,856
Is that selfish
for me to say?

982
01:26:04,992 --> 01:26:06,226
No.

983
01:26:09,729 --> 01:26:12,199
We're not gonna get to
have this, are we?

984
01:26:20,873 --> 01:26:21,876
Here.

985
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:32,253
I love it.

986
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:04,284
So you've earned yourself
a beer.

987
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:06,687
Yeah?

988
01:27:09,989 --> 01:27:11,792
Yeah, you look like
you could use one.

989
01:27:22,502 --> 01:27:23,804
To rock 'n' roll.

990
01:27:37,016 --> 01:27:38,353
That was one hell of a gig.

991
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,470
Dad.

992
01:27:58,939 --> 01:27:59,874
What if I stayed?

993
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,888
Oh, Frank.
You're gonna be late for work.

994
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:51,156
I'm right on schedule, Mom.

995
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:53,090
Yeah, sure you are.

996
01:28:53,092 --> 01:28:54,593
Oh, and I wrote everything
you need

997
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:56,527
in a note on the fridge.

998
01:28:56,529 --> 01:28:58,028
Don't forget
Jackie's coming today.

999
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,897
So, just try not to give her
a hard time, yeah?

1000
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:01,098
Also, I'll be working late,

1001
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,099
so she'll be
making you dinner.

1002
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:03,934
No, I'm cooking dinner.

1003
01:29:03,936 --> 01:29:05,605
She can be my sous chef.

1004
01:29:07,106 --> 01:29:09,407
No cigarettes today, Frank.

1005
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:10,842
I'm going strong, see?

1006
01:29:10,844 --> 01:29:11,942
What the hell are you doing?

1007
01:29:11,944 --> 01:29:14,381
You ain't got no muscles.

1008
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:26,090
Hey.

1009
01:29:26,092 --> 01:29:27,127
Hey.

1010
01:29:28,962 --> 01:29:30,031
How're we doin'?

1011
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:32,065
All good.

1012
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:37,405
Okay. I'm outta here.

1013
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:39,974
Enjoy the trees.

1014
01:29:40,474 --> 01:29:41,909
Don't burn the place down.

1015
01:30:14,608 --> 01:30:15,610
Hey.

1016
01:30:16,976 --> 01:30:18,479
I heard
I might find you here.

1017
01:30:21,014 --> 01:30:22,016
Hi.

1018
01:30:22,615 --> 01:30:23,618
Hi.

1019
01:30:25,018 --> 01:30:26,617
How have you been?

1020
01:30:26,619 --> 01:30:29,856
I've been okay.

1021
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:32,523
How's Sam doing?

1022
01:30:32,525 --> 01:30:36,628
Sam is adjusting
to the West Coast lifestyle.

1023
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:39,830
But she's loving school.
She's doing great.

1024
01:30:39,832 --> 01:30:41,101
Oh, that's great.

1025
01:30:44,203 --> 01:30:47,841
So, what does the bartender
recommend?

1026
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,511
He recommends...

1027
01:30:52,045 --> 01:30:53,213
The good stuff.

1028
01:30:55,114 --> 01:30:56,281
Yes, please.

1029
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:06,461
Do you mind if the bartender
joins you?

1030
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,563
Not at all.

1031
01:31:11,664 --> 01:31:12,667
Um...

1032
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,567
You can't tell Dave
about this.

1033
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,483
Gotta slow down and enjoy.

1034
01:31:29,716 --> 01:31:30,518
Right?

1035
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,086
Right.

1036
01:31:35,588 --> 01:31:36,990
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1037
01:31:46,699 --> 01:31:48,098
That Animal Collective Record,

1038
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,101
<i>My Girls</i>
is the most beautiful song.

1039
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:51,635
- I love it.
- That is the song!

1040
01:31:51,637 --> 01:31:52,903
- Thank you.
- I knew it.

1041
01:31:52,905 --> 01:31:54,572
I knew you would get it.

1042
01:31:54,574 --> 01:31:56,273
I love this one,
it's so simple.

1043
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:59,044
What? It's so complicated.

1044
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:00,711
Musically,
it's very complicated.

1045
01:32:00,713 --> 01:32:02,917
But the lyrics are simple...

1046
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:19,063
Okay.
Who do we have next?

1047
01:32:19,065 --> 01:32:21,132
Sam Fisher. Sam Fisher here?

1048
01:32:21,134 --> 01:32:22,603
- Me.
- Come on up.

1049
01:32:33,145 --> 01:32:35,115
Um, hi.

1050
01:32:36,949 --> 01:32:39,750
This is my first time
performing solo,

1051
01:32:39,752 --> 01:32:41,621
so bear with me.

1052
01:32:42,221 --> 01:32:45,960
Um, this is a song I wrote

1053
01:32:47,627 --> 01:32:48,563
with my dad.

1054
01:32:51,331 --> 01:32:53,634
One, two, three, four.
