1
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,331
太棒了，夫人，不是吗?
Glorious, madam, isn't it?

2
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:21,832
是的。
Yes.

3
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,711
我能看看下面那个吗?
Could I see that one down there, please?

4
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,339
啊，是的，的确是这样，夫人。当然可以。
Why, yes, indeed, madam. By all means.

5
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,265
迈耶先生!迈耶先生!
Mr. Meyer! Mr. Meyer!

6
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,934
迈耶先生!迈耶先生!
Mr. Meyer! Mr. Meyer!

7
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,061
迈耶先生!迈耶先生!
Mr. Meyer! Mr. Meyer!

8
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,268
放我出去!放我出去!
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

9
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:30,192
这是什么?有个女人从迈耶公司偷了个手镯然后在第三大道当掉了。打开和关闭。
What's this? Some dame cops a bracelet outta Meyer and Company and hocks it on 3rd Avenue. Open and shut.

10
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,902
第一次进攻吗?不，她有案底。
First offense? No, she's got a record.

11
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,237
这是她第三次犯案。
This is her third offense.

12
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:36,782
好!好!圣诞节的初犯比老虎肉还硬。
Good! Good! First offender at Christmas time is tougher than tiger meat.

13
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,200
定罪率只有78%
Convictions only 78%

14
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,785
而去年这一比例为82%。
as against 82% last year.

15
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:44,790
我能处理这个案子吗，老板?我会给你定罪的…你也许能应付得和这些笨蛋一样好。
Can I handle this case, boss? I'll get you a conviction... Well, you could probably handle it as well as some of these dopes.

16
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,709
当合适的案子出现时，我会给你的。
When the right case comes along, I'll give it to you.

17
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,003
打老婆之类的。
Wife beater or something like that.

18
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,880
你的脸不适合起诉一个女人。
Your face isn't right to prosecute a woman.

19
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,549
给我接萨金特。
Get me Sargent.

20
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,467
他的脸有什么是我没有的?
What's his face got that mine hasn't got?

21
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,095
我不知道，但不管是什么，他还没输过我的案子。
I don't know, but whatever it is, he hasn't lost a case for me yet.

22
00:02:59,013 --> 00:02:59,972
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,682
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

24
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,476
如果这是办公室，他已经走了。
Well, if this is the office, he's already left.

25
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,645
我可没让你这么说，你个哑铃。
I didn't say to say that, you dumbbell.

26
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,565
我,没有。这不是他的办公室。
My, no. This isn't his office.

27
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,484
你就告诉他有个年轻女人想跟他约个时间。
You just tell him that a young woman wants to make an appointment with him.

28
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,278
这里不是办公室。
This isn't the office.

29
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,780
一位年轻女士想和你预约。
A young woman wants to make an appointment with you.

30
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,951
等一下。
Just a minute.

31
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,291
谁想和萨金特大师说话?
Who all wants to speak to master Sargent?

32
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,002
你的老板。
Your boss.

33
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,462
还好你没有以演戏为生。
It's a good thing you didn't take up the stage for a living.

34
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,214
15分钟后在这里见。
I'll see you down here in 15 minutes.

35
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:39,178
等一下，我办完马修斯的案子时你跟我说过是啊，但我还要开750英里呢。
Now wait a minute, you told me when I finished up the Matthews case... Yeah, but I got 750 miles to drive.

36
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,931
你妈妈肯定会生气的。
Your mother sure is gonna be mad.

37
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,933
当然，开车的时候睡着了，喝醉了。
Sure, and fall asleep at the wheel and get croaked.

38
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,144
那么，谁在为自己辩护呢?
Well, who's defending?

39
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,771
奥利里。
O'Leary.

40
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,314
饶舌之人?
That windbag?

41
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:55,527
他会发表葛底斯堡演说和《独立宣言》我会让汤姆在法庭上见你，你中午就能出院。
He'll give us the Gettysburg Address and the Declaration of Independence... I'll have Tom meet you in court and you'll be out of there by noon.

42
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,656
请记住你在和谁说话。
Kindly remember who you're talking to.

43
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,074
别把猪扯进来。
And leave the pigs out of it.

44
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:10,084
…在审判过程中，以证明被告从迈耶公司拿走了一个有价值的手镯。
...during the course of this trial, to prove that a valuable bracelet was taken from the premises of Meyer and Company by the defendant.

45
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:13,212
我不喜欢陪审团脸上的笑容!
I don't like the smile on that jury's pan!

46
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,339
所有的陪审团在圣诞节都会心软，汤米。
All juries get softhearted at Christmas, Tommy.

47
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,717
如果你有一个案子要起诉你会看到"世界和平，善待人类"
If you ever get a case to prosecute and you see that "peace on earth, goodwill toward men"

48
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,219
看着他们的眼睛，申请延期。
look come in their eyes, get a continuance.

49
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,056
这个论点多么站不住脚啊!
How flimsy is this argument!

50
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:30,062
这一切都是在浪费时间，陪审团的女士们先生们，浪费你我的时间。
All this is a waste of time, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, of your time and mine.

51
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,233
我们可以把时间花在最后一分钟的圣诞购物上。
Time we could spend to much better advantage in last minute Christmas shopping.

52
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,360
我知道这就是我想做的。
I know that's what I'd like to be doing.

53
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,405
请法庭允许，我们反对，法官阁下。
May it please the Court, we object, Your Honor.

54
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,699
陪审团的圣诞购物与本案无关。
The jury's Christmas shopping has nothing to do with the case.

55
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,075
反对持续。
Objection sustained.

56
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,079
陪审团不会理会奥利里先生关于圣诞购物的诱人暗示。
The jury will disregard Mr. O'Leary's tempting allusion to Christmas shopping.

57
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,124
很明显，我们都想去圣诞购物。
Quite obviously, we'd all like to be Christmas shopping.

58
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,752
我收回暗指，法官阁下。
I withdraw the allusion, Your Honor.

59
00:04:54,044 --> 00:05:07,933
我说的是浪费时间，是指控方竭尽全力证明安娜-罗斯·马龙，有时也被称为李·利安德……有时被称为很多其他的东西。
When I say there has been a waste of time, I mean that the State has gone to great lengths to prove that Anna-Rose Malone, sometimes known as Lee Leander... Sometimes known as a lot of other things.

60
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:16,442
…12月3日下午，他带着一只手镯走在第五大道上，这只手镯仍然是迈耶公司的财产。
...did on the afternoon of December 3rd, walk out upon 5th Avenue with a bracelet, which was still the property of Meyer and Company.

61
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,987
为了证明她坦白承认的事。
To prove something she freely admits.

62
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,534
好像这一事实的证据就构成了有罪的证据。
As if the proof of that fact constituted proof of guilt.

63
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,288
事实很简单。
The truth is simple.

64
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:43,552
手镯是在暂时失去意志和意识的情况下取下的，现在被称为精神分裂症，但以前被称为催眠。
The bracelet was removed during a temporary loss of will and consciousness, now known as schizophrenia, but formerly known as hypnotism.

65
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,806
这个年轻的女孩……"我们不反对"是什么意思?
This young girl... What do you mean "we're not going to object"?

66
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,434
闭嘴。他只是把案子推迟到圣诞节之后。
Shut up. He's just postponed the case till after Christmas.

67
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,269
你怎么知道的?
How do you figure that?

68
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,980
催眠术。
Hypnotism.

69
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,150
售货员给她看了手镯。
The salesman showed her the bracelet.

70
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,195
我劝她把它戴在手腕上。
Urged her to clasp it on her wrist.

71
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:05,532
请她在更有力的光线下检查一下。
Begged her to examine it under a more powerful light.

72
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,786
然后他找了个借口。
And then he excused himself.

73
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,621
不，这是老把戏!
No, it's an old trick!

74
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,540
这是穷人的诱惑。
This tempting of the poor.

75
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,461
他们说:“把它带回家，戴上几天。”
They say, "Take it home and wear it for a few days."

76
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,672
他们说:“今天下午开着它到处转。
They say, "Drive it around this afternoon.

77
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,091
“明天还回来。”
"Bring it back tomorrow."

78
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,344
哈!“按照你自己的条件去买。”
Ha! "Buy it on your own terms."

79
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:32,017
想想《浮士德》中梅菲斯托菲勒斯和玛格丽特之间的珠宝场景吧。
Consider the jewel scene between Mephistopheles and Marguerite in Faust.

80
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,685
我希望他不会唱这首歌。
I hope he isn't going to sing it.

81
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,605
手镯在强光下。
The bracelet is under a powerful light.

82
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,317
小女孩盯着它看。
The young girl stares at it.

83
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,694
近了。
Closer.

84
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,697
近了。
Closer.

85
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,119
中央那块巨大的石头在她眼中闪着耀眼的光芒。
The great central stone flashes blindingly in her eyes.

86
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,624
蓝色，绿色，紫色，橙色。
Blue, green, purple, orange.

87
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,087
突然间，颜色消失了。
Suddenly, the colors are gone.

88
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,090
一切都是黑暗。
All is darkness.

89
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,468
但这是什么?
But what is this?

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,138
商店在哪里?她的光芒在哪里?
Where is the shop? Where is the light she is under?

91
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:14,643
她怎么会在第五大道，离迈耶公司几个街区远的地方?
What is she doing on 5th Avenue, blocks away from Meyer and Company?

92
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,732
带着一种恐惧的震颤，她摸了摸自己的手腕，不敢看。
With a thrill of horror, she feels at her wrist, not daring to look.

93
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,694
毫无疑问。
No doubt about it.

94
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,237
然后恐慌。
Then panic.

95
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,407
她转身匆匆走向那家大珠宝店。
She turns and hurries towards the great jewelry store.

96
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,659
他们会相信她吗?
Will they believe her?

97
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,121
恐惧使她的腿变成了铅。
Fear turns her legs to lead.

98
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,541
一个街区，两个街区。
One block, two blocks.

99
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,794
她盲目地走着，撞见了以为她疯了的陌生人。
She goes blindly, bumping into strangers who think she must be crazy.

100
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,380
六块。
Six blocks.

101
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,924
大珠宝店终于来了。
There at last is the great jewelry store.

102
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,093
它的窗户上闪烁着宝石。
Its windows blazing with gems.

103
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,097
但是不，宝石不见了。
But no, the gems are gone.

104
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,599
窗户几乎是空的。
The window is almost bare.

105
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,688
带着一颗沉甸甸的心，她打开了锁。
With a sinking heart, she tries the lock.

106
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,649
它是封闭的。
It's closed.

107
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,570
迈耶公司今晚打烊了。
Meyer and Company have closed for the night.

108
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,075
你不做点什么吗?陪审团已经被收买了。
Ain't you gonna do something? That jury's sold right now.

109
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,577
嘘。等待。
Shh. Wait.

110
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,497
她该怎么办呢?
What was she to do?

111
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:19,958
夫人，你会怎么做?
What would you do, madam?

112
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,877
那真是个糟糕的地方。
Well, that's certainly a terrible spot to be in.

113
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,420
我想我……
I suppose I...

114
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:31,595
律师不得向陪审员提问，陪审员不得回答。
Counsel will refrain from questioning the jurors and the jurors will refrain from answering.

115
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:32,888
我从来没听说过这种事。
I've never heard of such a thing.

116
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,600
请法庭和陪审团原谅。
I beg the court and jury's pardon.

117
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,685
我被迷住了。
I was carried away.

118
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,730
她该怎么办呢?
What was she to do?

119
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,733
她该怎么办呢?
What was she to do?

120
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,277
突然，灵感来了。电话簿。
Suddenly, an inspiration. The telephone book.

121
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,906
梅耶公司。梅耶公司。
S.A. Meyer and Company. S.A. Meyer and Company.

122
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,159
梅耶检察官肯定住在什么地方，但他似乎没有。
S.A. Meyer must live somewhere, but he doesn't seem to.

123
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,120
“也许是长岛。”
"Maybe it's Long Island."

124
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,332
“S.A.迈耶。S.A.迈耶。”
"S.A. Meyer. S.A. Meyer."

125
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,000
他来了。
Here he is.

126
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,502
S.A.迈耶。
S.A. Meyer.

127
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,964
长岛罗斯林伍德米尔路324号。
324 Woodmere Road, Roslyn, Long Island.

128
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,132
我将乘第一班火车去长岛。
I'll take the first train to Long Island.

129
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,009
我会在晚餐时间到那里。
I'll be there at dinner time.

130
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,679
他会相信我的。他必须相信我。
He'll believe me. He's got to believe me.

131
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,305
他本应该上台的。
He should have been on the stage.

132
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,765
他是。
He was.

133
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,642
但是去长岛需要钱。
But it takes money to go to Long Island.

134
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:24,189
我去哪里弄钱去长岛告诉迈耶先生发生了什么?
Where will I get the money to go to Long Island and tell Mr. Meyer what happened?

135
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,024
然后一个疯狂的想法。
Then a crazy idea.

136
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,152
我要卖掉手镯，筹钱去长岛。
I'll hawk the bracelet to get the money to go to Long Island.

137
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,530
快，鹰店。
Quick, a hawk shop.

138
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:32,906
快，华生，拿针。
Quick, Watson, the needle.

139
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,033
我们到了。
Here we are.

140
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,995
一个和蔼可亲的当铺老板。
A nice, cozy pawn broker.

141
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,872
穷人的朋友。
A friend of the poor.

142
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,750
“能给我点钱吗?”
"May I get some money on this, please?"

143
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,004
“好吧，好吧，我想说你可以的，小姑娘。
"Well, well, I should say you could, young woman.

144
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,880
“你从哪儿弄到这幅画的?”
"Where did you get this piece?"

145
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,592
"好吧，别管我从哪儿弄来的，"我要在上面下注。快!”
"Well, never mind where I got it, "I want some money on it. Quick!"

146
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,635
“好了，好了，好了，好了，别紧张。
"Now, now, now, now, take it easy.

147
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,387
“一切都会好起来的。
"Everything is gonna be all right.

148
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,933
“进来吧。
"Just step in.

149
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,268
“请。
"Please.

150
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,478
“再远一点。”
"A little further."

151
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,939
砰!
Bang!

152
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,733
“把门锁上，我把她关在这里。”
"Lock that door while I keep her in here."

153
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,359
“哦!放我出去!”
"Ooh! Let me out of here!"

154
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,237
“你会做好的。
"You're gonna get it all right.

155
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,989
“喂?是的，警察局。
"Hello? Yeah, the police department.

156
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,160
“你好，我抓到抢劫迈耶公司的小偷了。”
"Hello, I've got the thief what robbed Meyer and Company."

157
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,666
辩方休息。
The defense rests.

158
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,676
催眠假说是一个非常有趣的假说。
The hypothesis of hypnotism is a very interesting one.

159
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,345
让我第一个承认吧。
Let me be the first to admit it.

160
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,222
但不幸的是，我不是Svengali。
But unfortunately I am no Svengali.

161
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,558
你们也一样，陪审团的女士们先生们。
Nor are you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

162
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,355
纽约州人民要求精神病学家凯梅茨医生提供专家证词。
The people of the state of New York will require the expert testimony of Dr. Keinmetz, the psychiatrist.

163
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:50,150
我很遗憾地告诉你，他正在佛罗里达度圣诞假期。
Whom I am sorry to say, is spending his Christmas vacation in Florida.

164
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,944
那你想怎么处理这件事?
Well, what do you want to do about this?

165
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,446
我反对，法官阁下
I object, Your Honor.

166
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,948
你怎么能反对他还没说过的话呢?
How can you object to something he's not yet said?

167
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,493
因为我知道他要说什么。
Because I know what he's going to say.

168
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,244
请允许，律师。
With your kind permission, Counsel.

169
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:09,586
由于辩方律师插入了一项未被证实的新内容，控方请求允许重新审理此案以便让凯梅茨博士作证。
Since the defense counsel has interjected a new element which was not testified to, the State asks permission to re-open the case for the purpose of allowing the testimony of Dr. Keinmetz.

170
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,882
并进一步请求延期到圣诞节假期后他就可以上班了。
And further requests that a continuance be granted till after the Christmas holidays when he will be available.

171
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,801
我对象!辩方已经总结完毕。
I object! The defense has summed up.

172
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,678
这个案子实际上已经结案了。
The case is practically closed.

173
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,054
反对无效。
Objection overruled.

174
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:27,938
陪审团的女士们先生们，我再次告诫你们不要互相交谈也不要与任何与本案有关的人交谈。
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are again admonished not to converse among yourselves nor with anyone else connected with this trial.

175
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:34,194
在案件最终提交给你之前，你也不能对此案发表任何意见。
Nor are you to form or express any opinion concerning this case until it is finally submitted to you.

176
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,615
被告在交纳五千美元保释金后将继续被拘留。
The defendant will remain in custody subject to giving a $5,000 bond.

177
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:46,915
本案所有陪审员，当事人和证人请于1月3日星期二上午10点返回法庭。
All jurors, parties and witnesses in this case are instructed to return to the court Tuesday, January 3rd, at 10:00 a.m.

178
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,710
休庭。
Court is adjourned.

179
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,671
祝大家圣诞快乐。
And a very merry Christmas to you all.

180
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,842
那是你对我耍的肮脏把戏。
That was a dirty trick you played on me.

181
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,301
那就意味着又要上法庭了。
That means another day in court.

182
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,803
我不是为国家工作。
I'm not working for the state.

183
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,471
我得挣钱。
I have to earn my money.

184
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,057
没有幽默感。圣诞快乐，弗朗西斯。
No sense of humor. Merry Christmas, Francis.

185
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,893
天啊，这不是我见过的最漂亮的假反转吗。
Boy, if that wasn't the neatest fake reverse I ever saw.

186
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,312
是啊，他就像一匹掉进煤洞里的马一样被骗了。
Yeah, he fell for that one like a horse down a coal hole.

187
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,772
你把我弄得一团糟。
A fine mess you've got me into.

188
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,524
我以为我要出去过圣诞节了。
I thought I was gonna be out of here for Christmas.

189
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,984
你只要交保释金就行了。
Well, all you gotta do is post a bond.

190
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,902
我怎样才能交保释金?我没有钱了。
How can I post a bond? I haven't any more money.

191
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,821
我也不想在监狱里过圣诞节。
And I don't want to spend Christmas in jail.

192
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,489
请不要让他们那样做。
Please don't let them do that.

193
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,116
你说你没有更多的钱是什么意思?
What do you mean you haven't got any more money?

194
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,118
我说了些什么?听到我自己的声音?
What have I been talking for? To hear my own voice?

195
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,287
要不是你说了那么多，我早就走了。
If you hadn't talked so much I'd be out of here by now.

196
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,872
你这话是什么意思?
What do you mean by that?

197
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,999
催眠术。那个插科打诨太老了，都长胡子了。
Hypnotism. That gag's so old it's got whiskers.

198
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,126
别让他们把我关在这里过圣诞节。
Please don't let them keep me here over Christmas.

199
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,336
如果你出去了，你能做什么?你没有钱。
Well, what could you do if you were out? You haven't got any money.

200
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,963
我可以四处走动，不是吗?
I could walk around, couldn't I?

201
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,757
事情不会那么糟的。
It ain't gonna be as bad as all that.

202
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,469
你会得到一个漂亮的小房间和一个漂亮的…对，对，对。不要管积累。
You'll get a nice little room and a nice... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nevermind the build-up.

203
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,804
他以为他要带我去丽兹酒店。
He thinks he's taking me to the Ritz.

204
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,890
祝你圣诞快乐。
I hope you have a merry Christmas.

205
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,150
出去的时候，让胖迈克进来。
On your way out, send Fat Mike in here.

206
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,693
胖麦克，那个担保人?
Fat Mike, the bondsman?

207
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,279
如果你认识其他胖迈克，你也可以寄给他们。
If you know any other Fat Mikes, you can send them too.

208
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,656
我明白了。
I get it.

209
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,784
你不知道，但让它过去吧。
You don't, but let it pass.

210
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,588
你要见我?
You want to see me?

211
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,882
找到匹配的了吗?
Yeah, you got a match?

212
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,801
一场比赛吗?当然，我找到匹配的了。
A match? Why, sure, I got a match.

213
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,093
我有一群。
I got a flock of them.

214
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:26,223
我,我……你知道些什么?
I, I... What do you know about that?

215
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,768
我发誓……我记得。我把它们给了埃尔默。
I could have swore... I remember. I gave them to Elmer.

216
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,188
你知道，他来找我，他说…不要紧。
You know, he come to me and he said... Never mind.

217
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,732
到1月3日的保释金5000元你要收多少钱?
How much will you charge for 5,000 bail till January 3rd?

218
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,025
他们给你栽赃了吗，伙计?
Did they pin something on you, pal?

219
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,360
不，不，不适合我。
No, no, it's not for me.

220
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,653
是给今天来过的那位年轻女士的。
It's for the young lady who was here today.

221
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,697
多少钱?
How much?

222
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,701
对你的朋友来说，不是红色沙摩卡。
Well, for a friend of yours, not a red samolka.

223
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,078
我不是在求你帮忙。
I'm not asking any favors.

224
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,747
赞成吗?这是我的荣幸。
Favors? It's a privilege.

225
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,582
你还住在原来的地方?
You still live in the same place?

226
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,876
是的。
Yeah.

227
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,711
你想让她多快出来?
How soon do you want her out?

228
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,004
马上。
Right away.

229
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,130
她出去了。
She's out.

230
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,216
谢谢。
Thanks.

231
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,726
我。
Me.

232
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:24,447
*今早醒来，忧郁笼罩着我的头*没有妈妈来抚慰我的伤痛…*
* Woke up this morning With the blues all around my head * Didn't have no mama To hold my aching... *

233
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:25,532
是的,先生?
Yes, sir?

234
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:26,700
大老板在吗?
Is the big boss in?

235
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,451
他在家，但不在家。
He's in, but he ain't home.

236
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,705
留着你的广播节目吧。
Save that for your radio act.

237
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,164
请进。
Come on in.

238
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,958
告诉大老板她来了，就这样。
Just tell the big boss that she's here, that's all.

239
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,543
谢谢胖迈克的夸奖。
With the compliments of Fat Mike.

240
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,836
明白了吗?
You got that?

00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,671
是的，先生，迈克先生。
Yes, sir, Mr. Mike.

242
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,756
不是迈克先生，是胖迈克。
Not Mr. Mike, Fat Mike.

243
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:47,220
是的，先生，胖先生……迈克!
Yes, sir, Mr. Fat... Mike!

244
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,222
好了，宝贝，法庭上见。
Okay, toots, I'll see you in court.

245
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,690
请坐好吗?
Won't you sit down, please?

246
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,993
好吧，现在又怎么了?
Well, what's the matter now?

247
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,578
她在这里。
She's here.

248
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,121
这里是谁?
Who's here?

249
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,748
我不知道，先生。
I don't know, sir.

250
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,291
那你怎么知道她在这里?
Well, then how do you know she's here?

251
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,919
嗯，我看见她进来了。
Well, I see'd her come in.

252
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,378
你看见谁进来了吗?
You see'd who come in?

253
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,422
这位女士。
The lady.

254
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,132
你是说，公寓里有个女人?
You mean, there's a lady in the apartment?

255
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,884
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

256
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,094
你为什么让她进来?我告诉过你我没人住。
What did you let her in for? I told you I wasn't home to anybody.

257
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:34,434
我告诉了他，但他推开门，把那位女士推了进去，并说了几句恭维话。
I told him that, but he shoved the door open and pushed the lady on in with his compliments.

258
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,560
是谁干的?
Who did?

259
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,103
脂肪艾克。
Fat Ike.

260
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,272
胖艾克?你是说胖麦克?
Fat Ike? You mean Fat Mike?

261
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,692
是的，长官，他可一点都不瘦。
Yes, sir. He sure ain't no thin Ike.

262
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,792
你好!
How do you do?

263
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,001
你好。
Hello.

264
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,087
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

265
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,631
我还不知道，但我有个大概的想法。
I don't know yet, but I've got a rough idea.

266
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,927
我很高兴你出来了……现在我要怎么做呢?
Well, I'm glad you're out and... Now what do I have to do for it?

267
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,681
首先，你可能会说谢谢，但如果这不符合你的计划，那就跳过它。
Well, for one thing you might say thank you, but if that doesn't fit in with your plans, just skip it.

268
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,767
我在这件事上的动机……苏格兰威士忌加苏打水。
My motives in this matter... Scotch and soda.

269
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:19,896
谢谢。
Thanks.

270
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:28,029
总有一天，你们中的一个男孩会以不同的方式开始其中一场戏。
One of these days, one of you boys is going to start one of these scenes differently.

271
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,532
我们中的一个姑娘会被吓死的。
And one of us girls is going to drop dead from surprise.

272
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,911
毫无疑问。现在如果你能告诉我…我想你对所有女囚犯都这么做吧?
No doubt. Now if you'll tell me... I suppose you do this with all the lady prisoners?

273
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,539
我,是的。我的人生就是一场漫长的狂欢。
My, yes. My life is just one long round of whoopee.

274
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,832
你现在的处境很好。
Well, you're in a good spot for it.

275
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,377
太棒了!我只需要竖起手指，我最轻微的突发奇想就能得到满足。
Wonderful! I merely have to raise my finger and my slightest whim is satisfied.

276
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,464
现在如果你愿意……我想如果有人说不，你就把它们放回冰箱里。
Now if you'll... And I suppose if anybody says no you just put them right back in the cooler.

277
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,716
这是正确的。
That's right.

278
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,803
听着，当法庭重新开庭的时候我会尽我所能让你在监狱里呆上很长一段时间。
Look, when court reconvenes I'm going to try my best to put you in jail for a good long time.

279
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:52,929
那是我的事。
That's my business.

280
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,058
但你还没有被定罪，所以我不明白你为什么不能像我们一样享受圣诞节。
But you haven't been convicted yet, so I don't see why you shouldn't enjoy Christmas like the rest of us.

281
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,184
所以我让迈克把你弄出来。
That's why I had Mike get you out.

282
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,352
把我带到这里来。
And bring me up here.

283
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,895
我没让他带你来这里。
I did not ask him to bring you up here.

284
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,605
那大猩猩为什么带我来这里?
Then why did that gorilla bring me up here?

285
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,858
因为他的脑子像下水道一样笨。
Because he's got a mind like a sewer.

286
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,317
谢谢。
Thanks.

287
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,200
听着，我很高兴能帮到你，但现在如果你愿意……你是说如果我不想的话，我可以留在这里吗?
Now, look, I'm very glad to have been of service to you, but now if you'll... You mean I don't have to stay here if I don't want to?

288
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,161
你当然不知道。
You most certainly do not.

289
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,873
那我就留下。
Then I'll stay.

290
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,251
但我不会被强迫。
But I won't be forced.

291
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,878
嘿，等一下。
Hey, now, wait a minute.

292
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,463
你知道，没有什么比方形射手更危险的了。
You know, there's nothing as dangerous as a square shooter.

293
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,882
如果所有的男人都像你，就不会有好女孩了。
If all men were like you there wouldn't be any nice girls left.

294
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,884
是的。
Yes.

295
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:34,137
好吧，所有这些都将导致一个非常有趣和深入的讨论，我现在没有时间继续讨论。
Well, all this is leading into a very interesting and deep-dish discussion, which I haven't time to pursue at the moment.

296
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,223
我要去短途旅行，因为要开很远的车，而且我还没吃晚饭……
I'm leaving on a little trip and as it's quite a drive and I haven't had my dinner yet...

297
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,894
你是说，你想让我走吗?
You mean, you want me to go?

298
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,229
嗯,是的。
Well, yes.

299
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,857
在哪里?
Where?

300
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,358
什么在哪里?
Where what?

301
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,488
好吧，毕竟，我是在去一个舒适的监狱的路上，有一日三餐和圣诞节的火鸡。
Well, after all, I was on my way to a nice comfortable jail with three meals a day and turkey for Christmas.

302
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,989
而现在，我……你不是住在什么地方吗?
And now, I... Don't you live someplace?

303
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,699
热狗!
Hot dog!

304
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,576
你一直住在哪儿，树上还是什么地方?
Well, where have you been living, in a tree or something?

305
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,037
我在酒店有个房间，但他们把我锁在外面了。
I had a room at a hotel, but they locked me out.

306
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,916
你欠旅馆多少钱?
And how much do you owe at the hotel?

307
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,877
嗯,126.40美元。
Um, $126.40.

308
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,132
那也解决不了你的问题，不是吗?
Well, that doesn't solve your problems, does it?

309
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,967
那你为什么不把我关回监狱呢。
Well, why don't you just put me back in the clink.

310
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,053
这会解决很多问题。
That'll solve a lot of problems.

311
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,263
我不确定我能不能。
Well, I'm not sure that I can.

312
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,390
好吧，这不是我的想法。
Well, that wasn't the idea.

313
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,519
你吃过晚饭了吗?
Have you had dinner?

314
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,270
还没有。
Not yet.

315
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,233
来吧，我请你吃我骗你没吃的圣诞晚餐，也许我们能想个办法。
Come on, I'll buy you that Christmas dinner I cheated you out of and maybe we can figure out something.

316
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,026
鲁弗斯，帮我拿外套好吗?
Rufus, get my coat, will you?

317
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,154
是的，萨金特先生。
Yes, sir, Mr. Sargent.

318
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:39,285
我只是给你们准备了几个三明治以防你们中途饿了。
I was just spreading y'all a few sandwiches in case you get hungry in the middle of the ride.

319
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,287
那你真的一点都不想让我上来吗?
You really didn't want me to come up here at all then?

320
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,956
很抱歉，我不知道。
I'm sorry to say I did not.

321
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,674
热狗!但别忘了你得去看看你妈。
Hot dog! But don't forget you gotta go see your ma.

322
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:22,328
*为你而活很轻松*生活很轻松*当你坠入爱河*而我也深陷爱河*生活中除了你什么都没有
* Living for you Is easy living * It's easy to live * When you're in love * And I'm so in love * There's nothing in life * But you *

323
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,544
当然，我不在的时候可以把我的公寓借给你。
Of course, I could lend you my apartment while I'm away.

324
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,213
听起来像在演戏，不是吗?
That sounds like a play, doesn't it?

325
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,798
是啊，听起来很失败。不,谢谢。
Yeah, it sounds like a flop. No, thanks.

326
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,052
别为我担心，我总能租一个星期左右的旅馆。
Don't worry about me, I can always chisel a hotel for a week or so.

327
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,888
这是个不错的俗气的主意。
That's a nice cheesy idea.

328
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,683
我可不想在地铁里睡觉。
Well, I'm not going to sleep in the subway.

329
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:49,147
至于假期，我想等你和我一起过完之后，我就会得到很多。
And as far as the holiday is concerned, I guess I'll get plenty of that when you get through with me.

330
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:53,234
我并不是说不愉快。你明白吗?
Not that I mean it in a disagreeable way. You understand?

331
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,320
我明白了。
I understand.

332
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,530
你的事是你的事。
Your business is your business.

333
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,616
不，谢谢。
No, thank you.

334
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:08,208
当然，有些人不喜欢这种生意，但总得有人干脏活。
Of course, some people wouldn't care for that kind of business but somebody has to do the dirty work.

335
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,960
真是太遗憾了，居然是你这么好的人。
It's just too bad it had to be somebody as nice as you.

336
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,091
你偷东西多久了?
How long have you been swiping things?

337
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,718
总是这样。
Always.

338
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,348
你以前被抓过吗?-你拿了你不需要的东西吗?
Did you ever get caught before? - Did you take things you didn't need?

339
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,350
确定。
Sure.

340
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:29,979
在美丽的事物面前，你是否突然有一种不可抗拒的冲动，想把它们拿在手里，带着它们匆匆离去?
In the presence of beautiful things, did you have the sudden irresistible urge to take them in your hands and hurry away with them?

341
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,356
你是说我被催眠了吗?
You mean was I hypnotized?

342
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,942
不，不，我是说也许你有盗窃癖。
No, no, I mean maybe you're a kleptomaniac.

343
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,945
不。不，他们试过了。
No. No, they tried that though.

344
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:43,117
不。你看，作为一个盗窃狂，你不能在事后卖掉任何东西，否则你就会失去业余的地位。
No. You see, to be a kleptomaniac, you can't sell any of the stuff afterwards or you lose your amateur standing.

345
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,702
你知道，我无法理解。
You know, I can't understand it.

346
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:49,123
一开始你认为这是遗传的，然后你发现一个七代牧师都在他身后的人。
First you think it's heredity, and then you get some guy with seven generations of clergymen behind him.

347
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,711
我不认为你能理解，因为你的思想是不同的。
I don't think you ever could understand because your mind is different.

348
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:58,883
你看，对与错对每个人都是一样的，但对与错却不一样。
Right or wrong is the same for everybody, you see, but the rights and the wrongs aren't the same.

349
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,220
就像在中国，他们吃狗肉。
Like in China, they eat dogs.

350
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:03,304
那是一堆废话。
That's a lot of piffle.

351
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,389
他们确实吃狗。
They do eat dogs.

352
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,890
不，不，我是说你的理论。
No, no, I mean your theory.

353
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,687
好吧，试试这样。
Well, try it like this.

354
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:19,028
假设你快饿死了，你没有食物，没有钱，也没有地方去买东西
Supposing you were starving to death, and you didn't have any food, and you didn't have any money, and you didn't have any place to get anything

355
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,656
市场前有一些面包。
and there were some loaves of bread out in front of a market.

356
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,828
现在，记住，你快饿死了，那个人转过身去了。
Now, remember, you're starving to death and the man's back was turned.

357
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,246
你会刷一个吗?
Would you swipe one?

358
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:30,623
我当然愿意。
You bet I would.

359
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,917
那是因为你很诚实。
That's because you're honest.

360
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:37,505
你知道，我会在街对面的旅馆吃一顿六道菜的晚餐，然后说我忘了带钱包。
You see, I'd have a six course dinner at the table d'hote across the street and then say I'd forgotten my purse.

361
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,631
明白区别了吗?
Get the difference?

362
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,842
是的。
Yeah.

363
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,218
你的方式更聪明。
Your way's smarter.

364
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:44,971
就是这样。
That's it.

365
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:46,973
我们聪明。
We're smart.

366
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,687
你好,杰克。你好吗？
Hello, Jack. How are you?

367
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,439
晚上好。
Good evening.

368
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,149
我想让你见见我妻子。
I want you to meet my wife.

369
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,359
亲爱的，这是约翰·萨金特。
My dear, this is John Sargent.

370
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,361
你好!你好!
How do you do? How do you do?

371
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,157
我是……小姐。我很抱歉。我没听清名字。
This is Miss... I'm so sorry. I didn't catch the name.

372
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,492
我很抱歉，杰克。我们必须快点。是的。
Well, I'm so sorry, Jack. We must hurry. Yes.

373
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:07,869
对不起，亲爱的。
I'm sorry, dear.

374
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,831
我没有想到这一点。
I hadn't thought of that.

375
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,291
哇，你真好。
Gee, you're sweet.

376
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,085
你从来没想错什么，是吗?
You never think of anything wrong, do you?

377
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,090
好吧，我们喝杯睡前酒，然后我得走了。
Well, let's have a nightcap and then I've got to get going.

378
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,011
几个B和B，你会让乐队演奏《我的印第安纳之家》吗?
A couple of B and B's, and will you have the band play My Indiana Home?

379
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:28,056
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

380
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,601
这是我欠你的火鸡大餐还有一间房和几份早餐。
Here's that turkey dinner I owe you and a room and a couple of breakfasts.

381
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,270
谢谢!非常感谢。
Thanks! Thanks a lot.

382
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,692
你不会再想和我跳舞了吧?
You wouldn't want to dance with me again, would you?

383
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:44,906
这不是在自找麻烦吗?我是说，我可能又会踩到你的脚。
Isn't that asking for trouble?... I mean, I might step on your feet again.

384
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,701
在这个阶段，再做几次仰卧起坐不会伤害到他们。
A couple of more crunches aren't going to hurt them at this stage.

385
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,349
你为什么让他们弹这首曲子?
Why did you have them play this piece?

386
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,683
因为那就是我要去的地方。
Because that's where I'm going.

387
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,435
不。你是印第安人吗?
No. Are you a Hoosier?

388
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,104
确定。印第安纳州沃巴什。
Sure. Wabash, Indiana.

389
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,897
那是沃巴什郊外的一个农场。
That is, a farm just outside of Wabash.

390
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,150
印第安纳州沃巴什!难怪我喜欢你。
Wabash, Indiana! No wonder I liked you.

391
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,360
我来自埃尔顿维尔。
I'm from Eltonville.

392
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,778
不!
No!

393
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,196
那离沃巴什只有50英里。
Why, that's only about 50 miles outside of Wabash.

394
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,448
是的，先生。好吧，我真倒霉!
Yes, sir. Well, I'll be darned!

395
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,077
想想看，我们还得来这里这样见面。
To think we had to come here and meet like this.

396
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:49,387
*我一直是一个流浪者*穿越陆地和海洋是的，我每年圣诞节都回家。
* I have always been a wanderer * Over land and sea Yes, I go home every Christmas.

397
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,680
你会怎么做?
You do?

398
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:51,764
我妈妈仍然经营着农场。
My mother still runs the farm.

399
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,433
她也很好。
She does all right, too.

400
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:58,187
养鹧鸪和波兰中国，还有…我们从来没有过这么好的东西。
Raises Partridge Wyandottes and Poland Chinas, and... We never had anything that swell.

401
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,190
直到最近我们才知道。
We didn't either till just lately.

402
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,609
你多久没回家了?
How long since you've been home?

403
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,319
从来没有。
Never.

404
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,447
为什么?
Why?

405
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,658
我跑了。
I ran away.

406
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,955
我当然不知道当时的情况，但是……不是很热。
Well, I don't know what the circumstances were, of course, but... Not so hot.

407
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,834
时间会解决这些问题的。
Well, time takes care of those things.

408
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,128
有人给你写信吗?
Folks write to you?

409
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,589
我父亲去世时，我收到了母亲的一封信。
I had a letter from my mother when my father died.

410
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,674
你妈妈还活着?
Your mother's alive?

411
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,801
我希望如此。
I hope so.

412
00:24:29,760 --> 00:25:00,416
*闪烁的烛光*依然明亮*为我穿过梧桐树*只为我*新割的干草散发出它所有的芬芳*从我曾经漫步的田野
* The gleaming candlelight * Still shining bright * Through the sycamores for me * Just for me * The new mown hay sends all its fragrance * From the fields I used to roam

413
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:07,882
当我梦见月光时，在沃巴什河上
* When I dream about the moonlight * On the Wabash

414
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:14,263
我渴望我印第安纳州的家
* And I long for my Indiana home *

415
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,599
嘿，你想不想回家过圣诞节?
Say, how would you like to go home for Christmas?

416
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:20,019
我可以顺路把你放下，回来的时候再来接你。
I could drop you off on the way and pick you up on the way back.

417
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,524
哇。
Gee.

418
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,916
去年我来的时候他们在这里工作。
They were working here last year when I came through.

419
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,921
它说向右。
It says to the right.

420
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,048
就在那边!
There it is over that way!

421
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,574
“布莱尔一家钢厂。”
"Blairs Mills."

422
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:16,909
布莱尔一家工厂。
Blairs Mills.

423
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,786
布莱尔一家工厂吗?
Blairs Mills?

424
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,043
Blairsville。不，不是这样的。
Blairsville. No, that's not it.

425
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,545
这就是C-5。
Here it is, C-5.

426
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,923
布莱尔一家工厂。在这里。它在宾夕法尼亚州。
Blairs Mills. Here it is. It's in Pennsylvania.

427
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,592
我们要从那里走吗?
Are we supposed to go through there?

428
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,012
这里离我们要经过的地方很近。
Well, it's very close to where we were supposed to go through.

429
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,096
这就是我所担心的。
That's what I was afraid of.

430
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,180
我们最好往北走一点。
We better bear north a little.

431
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,976
大概有我缩略图的一半那么远。
About half as far as my thumbnail.

432
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,937
走到那一步告诉我一声?
Let me know when we've gone that far?

433
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,814
北方在哪里?往这边走。
Where is north? Up this way.

434
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,358
不，不，我是说从我们现在的处境来看。
No, no, I mean from where we are.

435
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,818
这样的。
That way.

436
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,361
为什么?
Why?

437
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:57,783
嗯，我们一直在往那个方向走，所以很自然，它…这样的。你确定吗?
Well, we've been going that way, so naturally, it's... That way. Are you sure?

438
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,578
不。
No.

439
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,347
看起来有点陡峭。你觉得呢?
Looks a little steep. What do you think?

440
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,770
这种方式!
That way!

441
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,790
你现在想试试哪条路?
Which way do you wanna try now?

442
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,125
一个看起来和另一个一样糟糕。
One looks as bad as the other.

443
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,880
也许我们最好放弃这一切?
Maybe we'd better just give the whole thing up?

444
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,558
当心!有一头大象!
Look out! There's an elephant!

445
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,062
什么……咦，这是一台打谷机。
What the... Why, it's a threshing machine.

446
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,772
我好多年没见过了。
I haven't seen one for years.

447
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,816
我们走不远了，对吧?
We're not getting very far, are we?

448
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,652
好吧，我们还撑得住。
Well, we're holding our own.

449
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,320
原谅我。
Excuse me.

450
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,364
也许我们最好先打个盹，然后再试一次?
Hey, maybe we better take a snooze and then try it again?

451
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,367
是的。我觉得这是个好主意。
Yes. I think that would be a lovely idea.

452
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,631
我可以吃掉一头牛的后腿。
I could eat the hind leg off a cow.

453
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,550
我可以吃牛角。
I could eat the horns.

454
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,844
鲁弗斯!
Rufus!

455
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,265
他不是很聪明，但他会做饭。
He's not very bright but he can cook.

456
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,269
男孩!
Boy!

457
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:56,110
现在，这比监狱好还是不好?
Now, is this better than jail or isn't it?

458
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,446
我几乎忘了我要进监狱了。
I'd almost forgotten I was going to be in jail.

459
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,573
我很抱歉。我不是那个意思。
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

460
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,908
这次旅行的全部目的就是忘记它。
The whole purpose of the trip was to forget it.

461
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,368
谢谢你！
Thank you.

462
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:19,592
鸡肉，凉拌卷心菜，莳萝泡菜，火腿，瑞士奶酪，还有一些我认不出的东西。
Chicken, coleslaw, dill pickle, ham, Swiss cheese, and something else I can't identify.

463
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,511
那是蜡纸。
That's the wax paper.

464
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,430
也不错。
Not bad, either.

465
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,142
我希望妈妈见到我高兴。
I hope my mother will be glad to see me.

466
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,728
她当然会很高兴见到你。
Of course she'll be glad to see you.

467
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,608
我想她会的，好吧。
Yeah, I guess she will, all right.

468
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,427
怎么了?
What's the matter?

469
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,721
看！看看谁来了。
Look! Look who's here.

470
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:09,350
早上好，老板。
Well, good morning, Bossy.

471
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:11,519
嘿，我们被包围了。
Hey, we're surrounded.

472
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,103
我们在哪里?
Where are we?

473
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,191
喂，你早餐想喝点好牛奶吗?
Say, how would you like some nice milk for breakfast?

474
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,484
你还知道怎么做吗?
Would you still know how?

475
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,444
我会吗?
Would I?

476
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,614
当我从事法律工作时，印第安纳州七个县失去了最好的挤奶工。
When I took up the law, Indiana lost its finest milker in seven counties.

477
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:24,740
你看着我。
You just watch me.

478
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,033
那么，你打算把它放在什么里面呢?
Well, what are you going to put it in?

479
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,957
说，这东西是……似乎没有太多的选择。
Say, this thing is... There doesn't seem to be much choice.

480
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,458
我能hold住。
I can hold it.

481
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,793
谢谢。
Thanks.

482
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,546
好了，老大，你待在那等我回来。
Now, Bossy, you stay there till I get around.

483
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,673
是的。这很可爱。
Yeah. That's pretty cute.

484
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,718
你待在那儿，吃早饭。
Yeah, you stay there, breakfast.

485
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,893
喂，我可以用什么当凳子?
Say, what can I use for a stool?

486
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,353
我以前总是有个凳子。
I always used to have a stool.

487
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:55,938
在这里。我来告诉你。
Here. I'll tell you.

488
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,064
你拿着这个，我去坐在跑步板上。
You hold this and I can go and sit on the running board.

489
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,566
好吧。把她的尾巴绕过来。
All right. Get her tail around.

490
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,901
不错,专横的。拜托，老板。结束了,老板。结束了,老板。
Nice, Bossy. Come on, Boss. Over, Boss. Over, Boss.

491
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,361
她喜欢别人挠她的耳朵吗?
Does she like to have her ears tickled?

492
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,196
是的，我想是的。好吧。
Yeah, I think so. Okay.

493
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,281
给，把瓶子给我。
Here, give me the bottle.

494
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,407
你不想让我帮你拿着吗?
Don't you want me to hold it?

495
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,449
不，不，我用膝盖夹着。
No, no, I'll hold it between my knees.

496
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,659
我以前就是这么做的。
That's the way I used to do it.

497
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,870
让她多呆一会儿?我试试看。
Get her around a little more? I'll try.

498
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,247
过来吧，老板。来吧。来吧。
Come on over, Boss. Come on. Come on.

499
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,880
她好像不想去!
She doesn't seem to wanna go!

500
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,382
也许我不坐也能做。
Maybe I can do it without sitting.

501
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,136
来吧，老大。我们只要一品脱。
Now, come on, Boss. All we want is about a pint.

502
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:30,556
怎么样了?好……你说什么?
How's it coming? Fine... What did you say?

503
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:34,393
我说，她想被哄。等一下，老大。
I said, she wants to be coaxed. Whoa, hold still, Boss.

504
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,105
好了，很好。
There, that's fine.

505
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,483
你说什么?
What did you say?

506
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,652
你有牛奶吗?
Are you getting any milk?

507
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,696
是的，天气很好。
Yes, it's coming fine.

508
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,115
嘿，别让她动。把她推回去。
Hey, don't let her move. Push her back.

509
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,784
我已经尽我所能了。
I'm pushing as hard as I can.

510
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,454
不,不喜欢。把她往那边拉。
No, don't. Pull her back that way.

511
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,624
够远吗?
Is that far enough?

512
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,584
是的，够远了!
Yes, that's far enough!

513
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,547
你把早餐洒了。
You spilled the breakfast.

514
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,136
你这么做是为了什么?现在我们得从头再来。
What did you do that for? Now we'll have to start all over again.

515
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:13,349
你欺负她。嗯…嘿，看看你的帽子!怎么了?
You pushed her around. Well... Hey, look at your hat! What's the matter?

516
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,851
这一点都不好笑。
that's not funny.

517
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,729
那是我唯一一顶和这件衣服相配的帽子。
That's the only hat I've got that matches this dress.

518
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,981
早上好。
Good morning.

519
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,568
你在我的地盘上干什么?
What are you doing on my property?

520
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,819
我们不知道这是你的财产。
We didn't know this was your property.

521
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,697
你看，我们绕道而行，然后…贴得很清楚，不是吗?
You see, we got on a detour, and... It's posted clear enough, ain't it?

522
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,992
每100英尺有一个标志。你不识字吗?
There's a sign every 100 feet. Can't you read?

523
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,495
嗯，你看，我们碰巧是在半夜到这里的。
Well, you see, we happen to have got here in the middle of the night.

524
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:35,955
是的，我注意到你拆掉了我的篱笆。
Yes, I noticed you busted down my fence.

525
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,164
我很乐意付钱。
I'll be glad to pay for it.

526
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,874
你会付出代价的，好吗?
You'll pay for it, all right.

527
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:49,176
你们纽约人以为你们可以非法侵入别人的财产，破坏他们的围栏，玩弄他们的牛，在他们的田地里过夜，和我不知道是什么…
You New Yorkers think you can trespass on people's property, break down their fences, fool around with their cattle, spend the night in their fields with I don't know what kind of a...

528
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,388
喂，听着，你这个肮脏的家伙……听着，你这个新来的乡巴佬…把你的语言留给法官吧!
Say, listen, you filthy-minded... Listen, you fresh hick... Save your language for the judge!

529
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,681
谁会逮捕我们?
Who's going to arrest us?

530
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,140
你被捕了。
You're under arrest now.

531
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,934
你的搜查令或警徽呢?
Well, where's your warrant or your badge of office?

532
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,477
别装可爱!
Don't get cute!

533
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,855
我是美国公民，你被捕了。
I'm a citizen of the United States, and you're under arrest.

534
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,817
如果你不这么认为，那就试着离开。
And if you think you ain't, just try to get away.

535
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:06,527
他能做到吗?
Can he do that?

536
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,529
不幸的是，他可以。
Unfortunately, he can.

537
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,364
我们怎么办，走路吗?我们会骑。
What'll we do, walk? We'll ride.

538
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,573
打开那个隆隆作响的座位。
Open that rumble seat.

539
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,325
你自己打开吧。
Open it yourself.

540
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,629
请把你的手帕给我好吗?
May I have your handkerchief, please?

541
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,464
谢谢你！
Thank you.

542
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,716
在这里。
Right here.

543
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:29,967
不要说出你的真名。
Don't give your right name.

544
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,427
这是个好主意。也不要给我你的。
That's a good idea. Don't give yours, either.

545
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,178
我从来没有。
I never do.

546
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,014
我今天早上给他们买的蛋糕还好吗?
Did I get them cakes all right this morning?

547
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,223
很好。
Fine.

548
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,149
看起来是生意，克莱德。
Looks like business, Clyde.

549
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:53,365
我敢说，如果这不是奉子成婚的话…不，那是汉克。他可能有几个非法侵入者。
Well, I declare if that ain't a shotgun wedding... No, that's Hank. He's probably got a couple of trespassers.

550
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,118
有了这条新弯路，他总是能抓到他们。
With that new detour, he gets 'em all the time.

551
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,955
真可惜他不能等到别人吃完早饭再说。
Well, it's a pity he couldn't wait till a body's had his breakfast.

552
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,917
我要见治安法官。
I want to see the Justice of the Peace.

553
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,419
去吧!
Go on!

554
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,421
有点早，不是吗?
Kinda early, ain't you?

555
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,218
早上好，法官阁下。
Good morning, Your Honor.

556
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,636
这里似乎有点小误会。
There seems to have been a little misunderstanding here all around.

557
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:20,809
这位先生在他的田地里发现了我的车，自然而然地得出结论……什么罪名，汉克?
This gentleman here found my car in his field and naturally he came to the conclusion that... What's the charge, Hank?

558
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:25,064
擅闯张贴的财产，肆意破坏围栏，以及轻微盗窃罪。
Trespassing on posted property, wanton destruction of a fence, and petty larceny.

559
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,690
这不是……他们偷了什么?
That's not... What'd they steal?

560
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,776
他们在给我的一头奶牛挤奶时被我抓住了。
They was milking one of my cows when I caught 'em.

561
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,736
装在这么大的保温瓶里!
In a little thermos bottle that big!

562
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,614
没人问你什么，小姑娘。
Nobody asked you anything, young woman.

563
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:37,159
轮到你的时候，你想说什么就说什么。
When it comes your turn, you can talk all you like.

564
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,456
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

565
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,582
玛丽·史密斯。
Mary Smith.

566
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,796
玛丽·史密斯。
Mary Smith.

567
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:50,923
你住在哪里?
Where do you live?

568
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:52,633
咆哮瀑布，俄亥俄州。
Roaring Falls, Ohio.

569
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,010
咆哮瀑布，俄亥俄州。
Roaring Falls, Ohio.

570
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,554
职业?
Occupation?

571
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:58,680
泡沫的舞者。
Bubble dancer.

572
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,184
泡泡舞者，你知道的。
Bubble dancer, you know.

573
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,562
不管那是什么!
Whatever that is!

574
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,401
泡沫的舞者。
Bubble dancer.

575
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,405
好吧。你叫什么名字?
All right. What's your name?

576
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,282
亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗。
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

577
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,076
纽约，纽约。
New York, New York.

578
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:24,873
亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗。
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

579
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,126
纽约。
New York.

580
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:28,961
职业?
Occupation?

581
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,587
Steamfitter。
Steamfitter.

582
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,509
Steamfitter。
Steamfitter.

583
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,888
好吧。你是认罪还是不认罪?
All right. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

584
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,810
法官大人，我对法律程序有些熟悉，因为我曾经考虑过法律。
May it please Your Honor, I am somewhat familiar with legal procedure, having at one time contemplated the law.

585
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,687
那你就不该违法。
Then you shouldn't have broken the law.

586
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,021
这是对事实的无知，法官阁下。
It was an ignorance of the fact, Your Honor.

587
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,940
无知不是借口。
Ignorance is no excuse.

588
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,902
我知道这一点，我也知道非本州居民提出的"无罪抗辩"意味着什么。
I'm aware of that, and I'm also aware of what a plea of "not guilty" means when made by non-residents of the State.

589
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,113
还没结婚呢。
Ain't even married.

590
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,823
我不知道你说的"结婚"是什么意思
I don't know what you mean by "even married."

591
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:02,953
你说“甚至结婚了”，好像结婚是人们最不可能的事，是一种微不足道的安排!
You say "even married" as though married was the least people could be, some minor, unimportant arrangement!

592
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,621
我呼吁您的骑士精神，法官大人。
I appeal to your sense of chivalry, Your Honor.

593
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:12,880
我猜你是个已婚男人，开门的那位迷人的女士是你的……在我的地盘过夜，从外地来的。
I take it you're a married man and that the charming lady who opened the door was your... Spent the night in my field, from out of the state.

594
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:19,636
我的博学的对手，我是说那个拿着猎枪的暴徒，试图在这个案件中注入一种……你是认罪还是不认罪?
My learned opponent here, I mean that thug with the shotgun, is trying to inject into this case an element of... Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

595
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:25,100
什么?你一定觉得有点好笑……非法侵入，破坏私有财产，以及小偷小摸。
To what? It must feel kinda funny to you... To trespass, destruction of private property, and petty larceny.

596
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,185
你将就什么?
What'll you settle for?

597
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,853
我将就什么呢?
What'll I settle for?

598
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,356
你学法律的时候听说过藐视法庭罪吗?
Did you ever hear of contempt of court while you were studying the law?

599
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:35,611
我想我还是把你交给警察然后送你去县政府吧!
I think I'll just remand you to the constable and send you over to the county seat!

600
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,696
现在，等一下……等等,什么!
Now, wait a minute... Wait, nothing!

601
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:45,579
我本想给你一个公平的审判，但当男人像你一样开车把女孩越过州界，这件事就值得调查了。
I was trying to give you a fair trial, but when men drive girls over the state line as you did, the matter's worth investigating.

602
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,124
此外，当他们给亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗起有趣的名字时。
Also, when they give funny names like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

603
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:54,004
你可能认为你在和乡巴佬打交道，我要给你机会……
You may think you're dealing with rubes and I'm going to give you the opportunity...

604
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,383
这是什么?
What is it?

605
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,010
得到一些东西!
Get something!

606
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,846
原谅我。怎么了?
Pardon me. What's the matter?

607
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,056
喝点水。办公室着火了。
Get some water. The office is on fire.

608
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,558
水!水!水!
Water! Water! Water!

609
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,019
这只是一个废纸篓。来吧!
It's only a wastebasket. Come on!

610
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,520
不要紧。
Never mind.

611
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,231
在那里。
There.

612
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,901
那只丁当怎么着火了…我们找到了。
How the ding dang that ever caught on fire... We've got it.

613
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,986
他们去哪了?
Well, where'd they go?

614
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,155
好吧，我真倒霉!
Well, I'll be god-darned!

615
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,493
嘿!
Hey!

616
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,078
汉克，你会打破我的窗户的。
Hank, you'll break my window.

617
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,080
别这么做，汉克。汉克，你会打破窗户的。
Don't do it, Hank. Hank, you'll break the window.

618
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,250
在那里!
There!

619
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,420
你是傻瓜吗?着火了!
Are you a loon? There's the fire!

620
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,483
好吧，就是这样。在回去的路上，我想我们得绕道加拿大了。
Well, that's that. On the way back, I suppose we'll have to duck around through Canada.

621
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,319
我想那样会更好。
I guess that would be better.

622
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,947
你一定觉得当逃犯很好笑吧。
It must feel kind of funny to you to be a fugitive from justice.

623
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,365
很有趣。
Very funny.

624
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,785
你知道吗，穿过宾夕法尼亚，我一直想弄清楚那场火是怎么开始的。
You know, all the way across Pennsylvania, I've been trying to figure out how that fire got started.

625
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,662
没有人吸烟。
Nobody was smoking.

626
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,456
我是。
I was.

627
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,001
你是吗?
You were?

628
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,713
你往篮子里扔东西了吗?
Did you throw anything in that basket?

629
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,172
除了火柴什么都没有。
Nothing but a match.

630
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,133
一根点燃的火柴?
A lighted match?

631
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,969
我想那里面一定有生命。
I guess there must have been some life in it.

632
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,138
你是故意扔进去的吗?
Did you throw it in there on purpose?

633
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,641
我的目标不是痰盂。
Well, I wasn't aiming for the spittoon.

634
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,351
我想你知道那叫纵火吧。
I suppose you know that's called arson.

635
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,020
不!
No!

636
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,856
我以为那是你咬人的时候。
I thought that was when you bit somebody.

637
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,734
“咬人!”
"Bit somebody!"

638
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:42,029
总比进监狱好，不是吗?
Well, it's better than going to jail, isn't it?

639
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,114
我告诉过你我的思维方式不一样。
I told you my mind worked differently.

640
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,700
你知不知道那房子可能在一英里高的地方着火了?
Do you realize that house is probably in flames a mile high?

641
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,076
我希望是这样。我也是。
I hope it is. Well, so do I.

642
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,828
但这和这个案子的道德有什么关系呢?
But what's that got to do with the morals of the case?

643
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,123
这跟道德有什么关系?
What have morals got to do with it?

644
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,667
你把我当妹妹看待。
You've treated me like your sister.

645
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,306
我们到了。
Here we are.

646
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,314
它没有太大变化。
It hasn't changed much.

647
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:18,940
新药店。
New drugstore.

648
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,817
是的，他们会在一夜之间潜入。
Yeah, they creep in overnight.

649
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,153
那是我第一次参加舞会的地方。
That's where I went to my first dance.

650
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,821
我第一次参加舞会是在消防站。
I went to my first dance in a firehouse.

651
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,283
我也去过消防站。
I've been to the firehouse, too.

652
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,035
我要一直往前走吗?
Do I keep ongoing straight ahead?

653
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,371
不，你在下一个路口左转。
No, you turn left at the next corner.

654
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,499
在轨道的另一边大约一英里。
It's about a mile the other side of the tracks.

655
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,962
我开始害怕了。
I'm getting scared.

656
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,339
现在,现在。
Now, now.

657
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:00,273
请。让我们等到……她可能都不住在这里了。
Please. Let's wait till... She might not even live here anymore.

658
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,280
看在上帝的份上，别紧张。
Now, don't be nervous, for heaven's sake.

659
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,365
你愿意和我一起进去吗?
Will you go in with me?

660
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,867
当然，我和你一起进去。来吧。
Sure, I'll go in with you. Come on.

661
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,286
看到那棵树了吗?
See that tree?

662
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,996
我12岁的时候摔了下来。
I fell out of it when I was 12.

663
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,915
从那个分支开始。
From that branch right there.

664
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,583
我是个糟糕的假小子。
I was a terrible tomboy.

665
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,877
如果我是个男人，我就会跑到海里去。
If I'd been a man, I would have run away to sea.

666
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,045
我的头着地了。
I landed on my head.

667
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,755
是吗?这比催眠更搞笑。
Yeah? That's a better gag than hypnotism.

668
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,173
你的律师为什么不用这个?
Why didn't your lawyer use that?

669
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,383
我不知道。
I don't know.

670
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,427
你应该请我当你的律师。
You should have had me for your lawyer.

671
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,346
好了，我们到了。
Well, here we are.

672
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,266
来吧，微笑。
Come on now, smile.

673
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:44,860
我不是故意敲门那么大声的。
I didn't mean to knock so loud.

674
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,404
怎么，听起来像米奇。
Why, that sounds like Mickey.

675
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:50,615
不过我不这么认为，他会……闭嘴!
I don't suppose it is though, he'd be... Shut up!

676
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,409
有人要来了。
Somebody's coming.

677
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,163
天啊，你真好。
Gee, you've been sweet.

678
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,875
是吗?
Yes?

679
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,755
我非常抱歉。
I'm terribly sorry.

680
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,300
马龙太太不住这儿了吗?
Doesn't Mrs. Malone live here anymore?

681
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,427
我想你是说我妻子。
I guess you mean my wife.

682
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,774
马!外面有人想见你。
Ma! Somebody out there wants to see you.

683
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,328
圣诞快乐，妈妈。
Merry Christmas, Mama.

684
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,626
进来。
Come in.

685
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:05,774
嗯，这位是……萨金特。萨金特。
Um, this is Mr... Sargent. Sargent.

686
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,025
你好!
How do you do?

687
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,401
坐下来。
Sit down.

688
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,199
你看起来很好，妈妈。
You're looking fine, Mama.

689
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:17,577
你来这儿干什么?你想要什么?
What'd you come here for? What do you want?

690
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,704
我什么都不要，妈妈。
I don't want anything, Mama.

691
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,086
那天刚好是圣诞节，萨金特先生碰巧在开车……你知道，我就住在沃巴什附近，我知道你会很乐意……所以他把我带来了。
It was just Christmas, and Mr. Sargent happened to be driving... You see, I live just outside of Wabash, and I knew you'd be glad to... So he brought me with him.

692
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,755
高兴吗?我为什么要高兴呢?
Glad? Why should I be glad?

693
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,174
她走的那天，我说:“总算摆脱了那些垃圾。”
"Good riddance to bad rubbish," I said the day she left.

694
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,053
求你了,妈妈。萨金特……就像她的父亲一样。
Please, Mama. Mr. Sargent... Just like her father, she is.

695
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,973
她总是对严肃的事情发笑。
Always laughing at serious things, she was.

696
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:42,602
她从不听话，直到她像我说的那样偷东西。
Never doing what she was told, till she winds up stealing, as I always said she would.

697
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,939
偷了我辛辛苦苦存起来的任务经费。
Stealing my mission money that I put by with the sweat of my brow.

698
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,691
我没有偷。
I didn't steal it.

699
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:51,027
我跟你说过一千遍了，我只是借的。
I've told you a thousand times I only borrowed it.

700
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,488
我本来打算用我赚的钱还你的。
I was going to pay you back out of what I'd earn.

701
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,906
但你没有还我钱，对吧?
But you didn't pay me back, did you?

702
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,993
你从没还过我钱，也没还过别人钱。
And you never paid me back, and you never paid anybody else back.

703
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:00,912
你当着全镇人的面说我是小偷，我怎么能这么做?
How could I after you called me a thief in front of the whole town?

704
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,582
你觉得之后还有人会让我为他们工作吗?
Do you think anybody'd let me work for them after that?

705
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:09,379
我们在这里配不上她，一个体面的家，一个勤劳的母亲和一个骗子的女儿。
We weren't good enough for her here, a decent home and a hardworking mother with a crook for a daughter.

706
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,299
我不想催你，但我们还有50英里要走。
I don't want to rush you, but we've still got 50 miles to go.

707
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,176
你不觉得我们该走了吗?
Don't you think we'd better be on our way?

708
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,305
谢谢。
Thanks.

709
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,936
再见,妈妈。
Goodbye, Mama.

710
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,940
很高兴见到你，夫人。这个名字与你无关。
It's been very interesting meeting you, Mrs... The name doesn't concern you.

711
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,942
当然不是。
It certainly does not.

712
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:42,871
来吧，现在。
Come on, now.

713
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:45,165
事情没那么糟。
It isn't as bad as that.

714
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:51,046
我忘了那个女人是多么恨我，而我是多么恨她。
I'd forgotten how much that woman hates me, and how much I hate her.

715
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:56,092
这么说太可怕了，不是吗?
That's a terrible thing to say, isn't it?

716
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:03,475
从我小时候起，她总是对的，而我总是错的。
Ever since I was little, she was always so right and I was always so wrong.

717
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,978
她总是那么好，而我总是那么坏。她……
She was always so good and I was always so bad. She...

718
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,525
谢谢你把我救出来。
Thank you for getting me out.

719
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:17,072
我愿意待在任何地方，只是不要在这里，不要离她这么近!
I'll stay anywhere, only not here, not so close to her!

720
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:18,281
嘿。
Hey.

721
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,913
我真希望从树上掉下来的时候摔断了脖子。
I wish I'd broken my neck when I fell out of that tree.

722
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:27,332
现在想这个有点晚了，不是吗?
It's a little late to think about that now, isn't it?

723
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,751
你不会让我留在埃尔顿维尔吧?不，我不会的。
You won't make me stay in Eltonville? No, I won't.

724
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,252
你能给我另找个房间吗?
You'll find me a room someplace else?

725
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,587
我会的。
I will.

726
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:35,924
任何旧垃圾场都可以。
Any old dump will do.

727
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,886
这就是你要得到的。
That's just what you're gonna get.

728
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:46,643
只有一扇窗户，床垫是用石头填的，还有一幅画，画的是你这辈子见过的最对眼的老头。
It's only got one window, and the mattress is stuffed with rocks, and there's a painting of the cross-eyedest old guy you ever saw in your life.

729
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,103
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

730
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:50,772
我怎么知道是什么?我祖父是斗鸡眼?
How do I know what? That my grandfather was cross-eyed?

731
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:57,362
你是说你…你要带我回家?
You mean you're... You're taking me home with you?

732
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:58,988
当然，为什么不呢?
Sure, why not?

733
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,746
嘿!现在怎么办呢?
Hey! Now what?

734
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,926
你想把火放在哪里，萨金特夫人?
Where do you want that fire laid, Mrs. Sargent?

735
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,302
天哪，威利!
Land sakes, Willie!

736
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,179
二楼只有一个壁炉。
There's only one fireplace on the second floor.

737
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,723
你还没放好火吗?
Haven't you laid that fire yet?

738
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,517
不。他们让我削土豆。
No. They had me peeling potatoes.

739
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,149
艾米，我觉得饼干烧焦了!
Emmy, I think those cookies are burning!

740
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,317
土地的缘故!
Land sakes!

741
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,455
露西·萨金特，饼干没烧焦!
Lucy Sargent, those cookies are not burning!

742
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:54,294
我敢说，只要杰克一回家，你的样子就足以让人发疯了。
I declare it's enough to drive a body crazy the way you carry on when Jack comes home.

743
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:57,338
我还没烧过东西，而且…
I've never burned anything yet, and it's...

744
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,227
在那里。
There.

745
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,606
我是该现在生火呢，萨金特太太，还是等他来?
Should I light the fire now, Mrs. Sargent, or wait till he gets here?

746
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,441
威利，房间看起来冷吗?
Does the room seem chilly, Willie?

747
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:29,329
不，看起来不冷，威利…我觉得很冷，但是，这周围的人整天把我折腾得精疲力尽，我怀疑即使在……冰池。
No, it don't seem chilly Willie... Chilly to me, but, then the way everybody around this place has been running me ragged all day long, I doubt if I'd be chilly even in a... Ice pond.

748
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,413
谢谢你，女士。
Thank you, ma'am.

749
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:36,044
听着，威利·西姆斯，如果你再抱怨，我宣布我要……我不知道该怎么办了。
Now, see here, Willie Sims, if you don't stop complaining, I declare I'll... Well, I don't know what I'll do.

750
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:40,757
在这里，你得到了一个可爱的家，除了几头牛和几只鸡…和猪。
Here you are getting a lovely home with nothing but a few cows and chickens to... And pigs.

751
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,133
几头猪是什么?
What are a few pigs?

752
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,593
和骡子。
And mules.

753
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,261
他们不需要任何照顾。
They don't need any care.

754
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,765
而不是感激……还有公牛。
And instead of being grateful... And the bull.

755
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:53,603
好吧，公牛。但即便如此……兔子。
All right, the bull. But even so... Rabbits.

756
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:54,771
兔子。
Rabbits.

757
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:55,897
和鸭子。
And ducks.

758
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,193
和山羊。
And goats.

759
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,281
艾米，他来了!
Emmy, he's here!

760
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,367
威利，下去把门打开，好吗?
Willie, go down and open the door, will you?

761
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,744
别忘了还有火!威利，把他的包拿进来。
And don't forget the fire! Willie, bring in his bags.

762
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,329
火。
The fire.

763
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:12,539
来，把火柴给我，我自己来生火。
Here, give me the matches and I'll light the fire myself.

764
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,083
但是你……比赛!比赛!
But you... The matches! The matches!

765
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,627
袋。
The bags.

766
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,254
在那里!
There!

767
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:20,755
天啊!
Gosh!

768
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,090
铁杉。
Hemlock.

769
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,483
他来了!
Here he is!

770
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,151
艾米，快点。来吧!
Emmy, hurry up. Come on!

771
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,445
天哪，他有一辆新车!
Boy, he's got a new car!

772
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:45,530
他有一辆新车!
He's got a new car!

773
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:52,412
杰克!我简直等不及了!
Jack! I could hardly wait!

774
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,205
我太高兴了!你好,妈妈。
I'm so glad! Hello, Mother.

775
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,541
我的男孩!我的男孩!你好吗，妈妈?
My boy! My boy! How are you, Mother?

776
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:57,876
你好，艾美阿姨。
Hello, Aunt Emmy.

777
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,378
约翰·萨金特!
John Sargent!

778
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,338
我很高兴你在这里。
I declare I'm glad you're here.

779
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,799
只要不让你母亲失去理智就好。
If only to keep your mother from taking leave of her senses.

780
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,719
上周，这所房子一直…天啊。
For the last week, this house has been... Gosh.

781
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,637
你好,威利。还有女孩追你吗?
Hiya, Willie. Girls still chasing you?

782
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,556
你为什么迟到了?我们期待你6点来。
Why are you late? We expected you at 6:00.

783
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:12,932
你没出事故吧?
You didn't have an accident, did you?

784
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,101
嗯,没有。你看到…那是谁?
Well, no. You see... Who's that?

785
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:23,860
妈妈，艾玛阿姨，威利，这是来和我们一起过圣诞节的李利安德小姐。
Mother, Aunt Emma, Willie, this is Miss Lee Leander who's come to spend Christmas with us.

786
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,361
你好。
Hello.

787
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,196
我希望不会给你添太多麻烦。
I hope I won't be too much trouble.

788
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:31,367
麻烦吗?哎呀，上帝保佑你，孩子，你在这儿真是太高兴了。
Trouble? Why, bless you, child, it's a joy to have you here.

789
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,536
你应该发个电报，约翰·萨金特。
You might have sent a telegram, John Sargent.

790
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,706
自从你克拉拉阿姨来做罐头后爷爷的房间就没打扫过。
Grandpa's room hasn't been cleaned since your Aunt Clara was here for canning.

791
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,917
嘿，露西·萨金特，不是这样的!
Why, Lucy Sargent, that's not so!

792
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,710
怎么了，威利上周还在那呢。
Why, I had Willie in there just last week.

793
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:41,794
天啊!
Gosh!

794
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:42,921
它像口哨一样干净。
It's as clean as a whistle.

795
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,839
我对此表示怀疑。走吧，亲爱的。
Well, I doubt it. Come along, my dear.

796
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,301
你一定冻坏了，我们就像两只老母鸡一样站在这儿。
You must be freezing, and here we are standing like a couple of old hens.

797
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,054
你把饼干忘在烤箱里了吗?
Did you forget the cookies in the oven?

798
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:52,972
仁慈的天堂!
Merciful heavens!

799
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,767
小心点，艾米。
Be careful, Emmy.

800
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:58,353
来吧，亲爱的。
Come on, dear.

801
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,361
男孩!
Boy!

802
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:07,612
怎么啦？
What?

803
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,906
她不是很漂亮吗?
Ain't she a peach-a-rino?

804
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,451
我只能说热狗!
All I can say is hot dog!

805
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:14,911
给，拿着这些。
Here, take these.

806
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,254
也许我错了，但我的艾玛阿姨可能是世界上第二好的厨师。
You know, I may be wrong, but my Aunt Emma is probably the second best cook in the world.

807
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,215
你真会说话，杰克。
How you talk, Jack.

808
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,051
谁是第一名?
Who's the first best?

809
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:34,639
在那里。那个房间还远不够干净，李，但还过得去。
There. That room is still far from clean, Lee, but it's passable.

810
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,599
嗯，以前还过得去。
Well, it was pretty passable before.

811
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,434
嗯，现在很完美了。
Well, it's perfect now.

812
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,187
她为什么让你这么做?
Why did she make you do that?

813
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,272
威利本来可以轻而易举地做到的。
Why, Willie could have done them so easily.

814
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,024
威利。当然,威利。
Willie. Sure, Willie.

815
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:53,825
我喜欢做这些。我住过旅馆和……地方太久了，我没有像我想的那样经常在房子周围呆着。
I like doing them. I've lived in hotels and... Places so long, I haven't been around a house as much as I'd like to.

816
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:55,660
你父母都死了?
Your folks dead?

817
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,328
威利!
Willie!

818
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,330
我父亲死了。我母亲再婚了。
My father's dead. My mother's remarried.

819
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:02,458
我总是说这对孩子们来说太难了。
I always say that's so hard on children.

820
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,879
不管新父母有多好，都是不一样的。
No matter how nice the new parent is, it just isn't the same.

821
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,757
我看不出这有什么区别。
I don't see why that should make the slightest difference.

822
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:10,842
艾米!
Emmy!

823
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:12,427
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't.

824
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,975
好吧，来吧，大家，我们现在都到客厅去，听杰克弹钢琴。
Well, come on, everybody, let's all go in the parlor now and we'll listen to Jack play the piano.

825
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:22,270
我曾经上过价值14美元的钢琴课，他们永远不会忘记。
I took $14 worth of piano lessons once, and they've never forgotten it.

826
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,354
我会唱歌。
I can sing.

827
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,605
给你。
Here you are.

828
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:25,940
别全吃了。
Now, don't eat it all.

829
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,943
我们要把它系在圣诞树上。
We're going to string it for the Christmas tree.

830
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,074
Mi, Mi, Mi, Mi *
* Mi, mi, mi, mi *

831
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,285
李，亲爱的，你坐在这儿。
Lee, dear, you sit over here.

832
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,495
和艾美奖。
And Emmy.

833
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,247
你坐在这里。
You sit over here.

834
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,709
好吧。把火柴给我，威利。
All right. Give me the matches, Willie.

835
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:46,419
在你听到这个之前，你什么都没听到。
Until you've heard this, you've heard nothing.

836
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:51,841
考虑到他手的大小，他真的打得很好。
He really plays very well when you consider the size of his hands.

837
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:53,801
把爆米花给我，威利。
Bring me the popcorn, Willie.

838
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,933
演奏斯瓦尼河，杰克。
Play Swanee River, Jack.

839
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,352
斯旺尼河吗?然后唱出来。
Swanee River? And sing it.

840
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:12,737
都准备好了吗?
All ready?

841
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:25,625
*沿着斯旺尼河向下*遥远，遥远
* Way down upon the Swanee River * Far, far away

842
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:41,057
*那里是我的心永远转动的地方*那里是老人们停留的地方
* There's where my heart is turning ever * There's where the old folks stay

843
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,229
可爱吗?
Cute, too?

844
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:57,323
*上上下下的整个创造物*悲伤的我漫游
* All up and down the whole creation * Sadly I roam

845
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:15,967
*仍然怀念旧的创造*怀念家里的老人们*
* Still longing for the old creation * And for the old folks at home *

846
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,389
就是这样。
That's that.

847
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:23,015
再弹一个曲子，杰克!
Play one more piece now, Jack!

848
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,100
快出来!
Get out of there!

849
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:25,434
不，先生，要等到明年。
No, sir, not till next year.

850
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,103
请再做一次。
Please do just one more.

851
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,729
现在，来吧。我不知道了。
Now, come on. I don't know anymore.

852
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,982
是的，你知道我非常喜欢的圣诞颂歌。
Yes, you know the Christmas carol that I like so much.

853
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:32,441
妈妈，我们来了客人。
Mother, we've got a guest.

854
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,944
她也想听你说。你不会吗，李?
Well, she'd like to hear it, too. Wouldn't you, Lee?

855
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,697
我会弹一首曲子。我过去常在一毛钱店玩。
I can play a piece. I used to play in the ten-cent store.

856
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:38,823
那太好了。
That'd be nice.

857
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:40,825
我会唱《完美一天的结束》
I can sing The End of a Perfect Day.

858
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:41,993
威利!
Willie!

859
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,077
嗯，我可以。
Well, I can.

860
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,453
好吧，每个人都可以。
Well, so can everybody else.

861
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,581
来吧，威利，唱吧!
Come on, Willie, sing it!

862
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:48,708
好吧。
All right.

863
00:52:54,463 --> 00:53:11,731
*当你来到*完美的一天结束*你独自坐着思考
* When you come * To the end of a perfect day * And you sit alone with your thought

864
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:31,876
*当钟声响起时*伴着欢快的颂歌*为这一天带来的欢乐
* While the chimes ring out * With a carol gay * For the joy * That the day has brought

865
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:52,438
*你认为*完美一天的结束*对一颗疲惫的心意味着什么?
* Do you think * What the end of a perfect day * Can mean to a tired heart?

866
00:53:55,566 --> 00:54:15,878
*当夕阳西下*伴着燃烧的光芒*亲爱的朋友们*不得不分离*
* When the sun goes down * With a flaming ray * And the dear friends * Have to part *

867
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:32,395
天啊，孩子!你想得肺炎吗?
Land sakes, child! You want to catch pneumonia?

868
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,900
在那里!
There!

869
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,737
我想你最好也带一个热水瓶。
And I think you'd better have a hot water bottle, too.

870
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,406
你看起来有点憔悴。
You look a little peaked.

871
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:45,574
我像马一样强壮。
I'm as strong as a horse.

872
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,786
在这种天气里，很多马都有毛毛。
Well, many a horse has frizz in this weather.

873
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,783
妈妈吗?是的,亲爱的。
Mother? Yes, dear.

874
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:32,955
我不知道该不该告诉你，但我不想在你不知道她是谁的情况下把她带到你家里。
I don't know whether I should tell you this or not, but I don't like to bring somebody under your roof without your knowing exactly who she is.

875
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,249
我想我能猜到。
I think I can guess.

876
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,460
怎么啦？不，一点也不。
What? No, not at all.

877
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:38,753
她甚至都不是我的朋友。
She isn't even a friend of mine.

878
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,672
我觉得她很迷人。
Why, I think she's charming.

879
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:46,510
她让我想起了你父亲的表妹温妮弗雷德，她在第二个孩子出生时就去世了。
She reminds me of your father's cousin Winifred, who died when her second was born.

880
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,846
她是一个甜美可爱的人。
She was a sweet, lovely thing.

881
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:57,355
我刚跟你艾米阿姨说我觉得…是的，她很迷人，母亲，但不幸的是她是个骗子。
I was just telling your Aunt Emmy that I thought that... Yes, she is charming, Mother, but unfortunately she's a crook.

882
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,983
等我们回到纽约，我要把她送进监狱。
When we get back to New York, I'm going to try to put her in jail.

883
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:05,780
但与此同时，她没有地方过圣诞节，所以…可怜的小羊羔!
But in the meantime, she didn't have any place to spend Christmas, so... The poor lamb!

884
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,909
约翰，你不会这么做的。
John, why, you'll do no such thing.

885
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:12,620
那个女孩非常诚实。
That girl's as honest as all outdoors.

886
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:16,165
为什么，我一看她的脸就知道了。
Why, I can tell by just looking at her face.

887
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:20,378
如果她真的吃了什么，我敢肯定那完全是她的错。
If she did take anything, I'm sure it was entirely by mistake.

888
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:27,134
她可能有疑病症。
She's probably a hypochondriac.

889
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,262
也许是吧。
She might be, at that.

890
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:35,017
她什么都没拿吗?
She didn't really take anything?

891
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,019
你只是在开玩笑，对吧?
You're just making a bad joke, aren't you?

892
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:41,440
不,妈妈。恐怕这都不是她的初犯。
No, Mother. I'm afraid it's not even her first offense.

893
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,403
但这并不意味着她不快乐，不孤独，不像我们其他人一样是人。
But that doesn't mean that she wasn't unhappy and lonely, and a human being like the rest of us.

894
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,947
可怜的家伙!
The poor thing!

895
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,075
她小时候可能没有得到足够的爱。
She probably didn't get enough love as a child.

896
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:59,375
你还记得有多糟糕吗?你也不算太坏，但你还记得你拿了我买鸡蛋的钱，我打算用它买件新裙子，
Do you remember how bad... Well, you weren't really bad, but do you remember when you took my egg money I was going to buy a new dress with,

897
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:03,379
当你明白了之后，你又如何努力去偿还?
and then how hard you worked to pay it back when you did understand?

898
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,466
你让我明白了。
You made me understand.

899
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:11,220
不,亲爱的。是爱让你明白。
No, dear. It was love that made you understand.

900
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,561
我希望她和我们在这里过得愉快。
I hope she's going to enjoy her stay here with us.

901
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:23,399
我们想让她快乐和舒适……看到了吗?
We want to make her happy and comfortable... See that?

902
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,401
皮革也很好。
It's good leather, too.

903
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:29,447
杰克!
Jack!

904
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,950
你去年圣诞节给我的那瓶酒我还没喝呢!
Why, I haven't even started that bottle you gave me last Christmas!

905
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,785
“狂喜时刻!”
"Hour Of Ecstasy!"

906
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,954
这和你去年圣诞节送她的一样。
That's the same kind you gave her last Christmas.

907
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,165
它是什么?他们告诉我那是最新的!
It is? They told me that was the latest!

908
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:40,916
嗯，我喜欢它!
Well, I love it!

909
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,127
是不是很漂亮?
Isn't that pretty?

910
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,171
这也是最新的消息，艾米阿姨。
That's the latest too, Aunt Emmy.

911
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:49,467
怎么，杰克·萨金特，你应该为自己感到羞耻!
Why, Jack Sargent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!

912
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,595
我从来没有……威利!威利，还有一件事。
I never... Willie! Willie, here's something else.

913
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,597
男孩!
Boy!

914
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,475
哎呀，我喜欢圣诞节!
Gee, I love Christmas!

915
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,355
这是最新消息，威利。
That's the latest, Willie.

916
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,192
不，你穿反了。
No, you've got it on backwards.

917
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:07,693
不不，威利，这边走。
No, no, Willie, this way.

918
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:08,903
这是正确的。那条路?
That's right. That way?

919
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:11,363
只是你要用它来模仿。
Only you've got to yodel with it.

920
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:17,828
我待会再练习。
I'll practice up on that later.

921
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,706
天啊，太时髦了!找一面镜子。
Boy, is it snazzy! Find a mirror.

922
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,918
把我的东西都收拾好。亲爱的!
Get all my stuff together. Dear!

923
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,881
“妈妈寄来的杰克。”
"Jack from Mother,"

924
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:30,090
是的。
Yes.

925
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,301
有衣服穿吗?
Something to wear?

926
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,178
你等着瞧吧。
You wait and see.

927
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,515
一件毛衣吗?
A sweater?

928
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,183
你自己织的吗?
Did you knit it yourself?

929
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,392
谢谢,妈妈。这是膨胀。
Thanks, Mother. That's swell.

930
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,228
你喜欢这个颜色吗?确定。
You like the color? Sure.

931
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,354
好吧，我希望它合适。
Well, I hope it fits.

932
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,272
它会健康。
It'll fit.

933
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,608
“艾玛阿姨给杰克。”
"To Jack from Aunt Emma."

934
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,155
等不及要看了。
Can't wait to see it.

935
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,620
袜子呢?
Well, socks?

936
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,664
不是很高档，但能让你的脚暖和。
Not so fancy, but they'll keep your feet warm.

937
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,040
你觉得合身吗?
Do you think they'll fit?

938
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,209
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't know.

939
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,002
谢谢你，艾美阿姨。
Thanks, Aunt Emmy.

940
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,088
很幸运吗?
Well, pretty lucky?

941
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,924
你的赌注。
You bet.

942
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:19,181
对现在的情况我很抱歉。如果……那边还有一些其他的包裹。看看是给谁的。
Say, I'm sorry about the present situation. If... There's some other packages over there. See who they're for.

943
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:27,898
“李……”
"To Lee..."

944
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,485
好吧，我猜圣诞老人总是靠得住的。
Well, I guess you can always depend on Santa Claus.

945
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:32,987
圣诞快乐。
Merry Christmas.

946
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:35,406
不，你不该费这么大的劲。
No, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

947
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:37,783
快点，现在就把它们打开。
Come on, open them up right now.

948
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:52,590
谢谢你！它太漂亮了。
Thank you. It's so pretty.

949
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,550
这真的没什么。
It's really nothing at all.

950
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:59,054
只是用我多年来积累的一些废料和东西做的。
Just made from some scraps and things that I've accumulated through the years.

951
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,307
嗯，它很可爱。
Well, it's lovely.!

952
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,058
阿姨艾玛?
Aunt Emma?

953
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:18,532
虽然不怎么花哨，但对于一个老处女来说，在寒冷的夜晚也很不错!
Not so fancy, but they're grand on a cold night, for a spinster lady!

954
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,661
你真是太好了!
It's awfully sweet of you!

955
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,374
威利，谁寄来的?不。
Who's that from, Willie? No.

956
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,960
为什么，你这个笨蛋!
Why, you dunce!

957
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,212
你什么都不记得了吗?
Can't you remember anything?

958
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,016
狂喜时刻!
Hour Of Ecstasy!

959
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,769
是的，这是最新的消息。
Yeah, that's the latest.

960
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:49,438
这是我给你的，对吧?
That's the one I gave you, right?

961
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,775
谢谢你！
Thank you!

962
01:00:57,363 --> 01:00:59,782
你们都太好了。
You're all much too kind.

963
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:03,577
我从来没见过这么体贴的人，而且……哎呀，亲爱的，这根本没什么。
I've never met anyone so thoughtful and so... Why, my dear, it's nothing at all.

964
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:08,165
为什么，我们就是喜欢这样做。我们很高兴你能住在这里，我们非常希望你能在这里过得愉快。
Why, we just love doing it. We're happy to have you here, and we're so anxious for you to enjoy your stay.

965
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:13,420
你确实没有太多事情可做，所以你只能充分利用它。
There really isn't very much for you to do, so you'll just have to make the best of it.

966
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:22,471
今晚有几个朋友要来，我们要去抢苹果，然后明天年轻人要在雪地里寻宝，后天我们要去玩太妃糖游戏。
Tonight, a few friends are coming in, we're going to bob for apples, and then tomorrow the young people are going to have a treasure hunt in the snow, and the next day we have a taffy pull.

967
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,139
那会把房子弄脏吗。
And will that gum up the house.

968
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:25,432
天啊!嘘!
Gosh! Shh!

969
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,309
这不会是一排大头针。
It won't amount to a row of pins.

970
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:31,313
第二天我们会在教堂举行义卖和慈善自助餐。
And the day after that we have the rummage sale and the charity buffet at the church.

971
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,316
像你这样漂亮的姑娘应该能帮上大忙。
A pretty girl like you ought to be a big help.

972
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:37,986
为什么，这些人太紧了，我们几乎要抠他们的口袋……
Why, the men are so tight, we almost have to pick their pock...

973
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,034
好吧，我会尽力的。
Well, I'll do my best.

974
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,831
我的专长就是骗他们!
My specialty's shortchanging 'em!

975
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:50,416
艾美夫人!
MRS. - Emmy!

976
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:56,088
然后我们休息一天，再过一天就是除夕。
And then we rest up for a day, and the day after that is New Year's Eve.

977
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:00,259
今年我们要跳老式的谷仓舞就像乡巴佬一样。
This year we're going to have an old-fashioned barn dance like the hicks we're supposed to be.

978
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,136
这就是全部。
And that's all there is.

979
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:03,846
农民的妻子不再死于无聊，而是死于心力衰竭。
Farmers' wives don't die of boredom anymore, they die of heart failure.

980
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,391
你认为它们被爆了吗?
Do you suppose they're popped?

981
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:09,893
我肯定它们爆了。
I'm positive they've popped.

982
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,564
天啊，我真希望我能那么确定。
Gee, I wish I could be that sure.

983
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,065
等我告诉你秘密，你就会是了。
You will be when I've told you the secret.

984
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:17,192
但你绝不能让它从家里传出去。
But you must never let it out of the family.

985
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,277
你看到…
You see...

986
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,240
不，你确定吗?是的。
No, are you sure? Yes.

987
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:25,033
自己去找吧。
Look for yourself.

988
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:32,082
早上好。
Good morning.

989
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,917
早上好。吃点早餐怎么样?
Good morning. How's about some breakfast?

990
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,294
天哪，弹窗!
Holy smoke, popovers!

991
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,671
而且完全是她自己做的。
And she made them entirely by herself.

992
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:39,882
她做吗?好吧，带他们进来。
She did? Well, bring 'em in.

993
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:44,678
你为什么要告诉他那个?
What did you tell him that for?

994
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,931
难道你不知道通往男人心的捷径是通过他的胃吗?
Don't you know the shortcut to a man's heart's through his gizzard?

995
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,559
来，趁热吃吧。
Here, take 'em in while they're hot.

996
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,397
给你。
There you are.

997
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,608
走吧，快点!
Go on, hurry up!

998
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,448
我都不知道你会做饭。
Say, I didn't know you could cook.

999
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,283
这些不是我做的。她只是说我喜欢。
I didn't make these. She just said I did.

1000
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,452
她为什么这么说?
Why'd she say that?

1001
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:15,501
因为她教会了我怎么做。但我……我猜她觉得如果你觉得我知道怎么做，为什么，事情就会进展得更快。
Because she's taught me how. But I... Well, I guess she thought if you thought I knew how, why, that would make everything go faster.

1002
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:17,419
让什么走得更快?
Make what go faster?

1003
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,964
她以为你带我来这里是因为你爱上我了。
You see, she thinks you brought me out here because you're in love with me.

1004
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,555
很有趣，不是吗?是的。
Funny, isn't it? Yeah.

1005
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:32,518
如果你认为我做不出这么好吃的弹窗，那你就疯了!
Well, if you think I couldn't make a popover as good as that, you're nuts!

1006
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:43,278
法官，你就不能在我这桌买东西吗?
Judge, won't you buy something at my table?

1007
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,613
我马上就回来。请。
I'll be back in just a minute. Please.

1008
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:45,739
等一下，我马上回来。
Now, just a minute, I'll be back.

1009
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,157
法官，你一定要买这块桌布。
Judge, you just must buy this tablecloth.

1010
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,534
好的，好的，我马上就回来。
Yes, yes, I'll be back in just a minute.

1011
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:50,953
等一下。我马上回来。
Just a minute. I'll be back.

1012
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:52,704
法官，买个漂亮的相框怎么样?
Judge, how about a nice picture frame?

1013
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,498
我在找我的帽子，一顶丝绸帽子。
I'm looking for my hat, a silk hat.

1014
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,625
我妻子送来的。
My wife sent it down here.

1015
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,550
镇上最富有，最吝啬的人。别这样，艾米。
Richest, tightest man in town. Come on, Emmy.

1016
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,054
法官。是吗?
Judge. Yes?

1017
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,723
艾玛阿姨，记下一个犰狳篮子，7美元的。
Aunt Emma, mark down one armadillo basket, the $7 size.

1018
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,058
好吧。现在，等一下!
All right. Now, just a minute!

1019
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,434
没关系。我告诉你该怎么做。
That's all right. I'll tell you what you do.

1020
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:17,229
亲爱的小姐，我们以6美元的价格卖给你，你还可以亲亲艾玛阿姨。
My dear miss. We'll let you have it for $6 and you can kiss Aunt Emma in the bargain.

1021
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,565
"吻艾玛阿姨"?这太过分了!
"Kiss Aunt Emma"? Why, this is outrageous!

1022
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:22,609
3美元的变化。为什么,我…你会喜欢的，你会喜欢的。
$3 change. Why, I... You'll love it, you'll love it.

1023
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:23,694
3美元的变化。
$3 change.

1024
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:27,906
为什么，小姐，我反对……这太离谱了!
Why, miss, I protest against... This is outrageous!

1025
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,867
别紧张，法官。会没事的。非常感谢。
Take it easy, Judge. It'll be all right. Thank you very much.

1026
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:32,578
现在，说真的，萨金特夫人，我认为这个笑话已经过去了……约翰·萨金特!
Now, really, Mrs. Sargent, I think that this joke has gone... John Sargent!

1027
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,162
没人想逼你买东西，法官。
Nobody's trying to force you to buy anything, Judge.

1028
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,706
我们只要保持通道畅通就行了。
We just have to keep the aisles clear.

1029
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:38,584
可是，约翰，我反对这种做法!现在，约翰，我抗议!
But, John, I protest against it! Now, John, I protest!

1030
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:42,045
穿着裤子去参加舞会!
Wearing pants to a dance!

1031
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:44,381
她永远不会那样说服他的。
She'll never land him that way.

1032
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,513
女人应该穿裙子!
Women belong in skirts!

1033
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,973
让他们着迷的是神秘感。
It's the mystery that gets 'em.

1034
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:56,184
我只是觉得这些更容易穿。
I just thought these would be easier to wear.

1035
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:01,940
你的腰围有多大?
How big are you around the waist?

1036
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,443
我不知道，大概25、26岁吧。
I don't know, 25, 26, I guess.

1037
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:09,281
当我年轻的时候，我们认为19岁已经很大了。
When I was young, we thought 19 was big.

1038
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:12,159
怎么会有人只有19岁?
How could anybody be 19?

1039
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:18,332
好吧，这需要一点努力，但它可以做到!
Well, it takes a little pulling, but it can be done!

1040
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,084
现在，呼气。
Now, let out your breath.

1041
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:24,254
更多!来吧!
More! Come on!

1042
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:29,718
现在，一，二，三!
Now, one, two, three!

1043
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:35,432
现在，感觉如何?
Now, how does that feel?

1044
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:39,144
你会习惯的。
You'll get used to it.

1045
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,938
我们其他人都这么做了。
The rest of us did.

1046
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,065
胡说!
Fiddlesticks!

1047
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,946
现在把它系在你的腰上。
Now, tie that around your waist.

1048
01:05:56,036 --> 01:06:00,791
在我年轻的时候，我从来没有像我们应该拥有的那样拥有那么多的正面。
I never did have as much front as we were supposed to have in my day.

1049
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,670
你不会真的把这些东西都穿了吧?
You didn't really wear all these things, did you?

1050
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:07,756
当然，我们做到了。这仅仅是个开始。
Of course, we did. This is just the beginning.

1051
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,842
这是紧身胸衣的封面。
Now, here's the corset cover.

1052
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,972
把它系好。
Fasten it up.

1053
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:26,775
好了。
There you go.

1054
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,883
它是美丽的!
It's beautiful!

1055
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,976
那是你的婚纱吗?
Was that your wedding dress?

1056
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:07,274
有一年夏天，我一直在琢磨这个主意。
I twiddled around with the idea one summer.

1057
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,609
到了秋天，我又好了。
I was all right again by fall.

1058
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,362
谢谢你，亲爱的。
Thank you, dear.

1059
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,656
李!阿姨艾玛!
Lee! Aunt Emma!

1060
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,409
来了!来了!
Coming! Coming!

1061
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:19,453
生者之地!
Land of the living!

1062
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:22,456
在我们到达之前，舞会不会跑掉的!
The dance is not going to run away before we get there!

1063
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:25,125
我只是不想让李错过…
Well, I just didn't want Lee to miss the...

1064
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,384
天啊!
Gosh!

1065
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:39,658
她很漂亮，不是吗?
She's beautiful, isn't she?

1066
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,576
是的。
Yes.

1067
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,037
他们会有非常可爱的孩子。
They'd have awful cute babies.

1068
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,206
艾米，杰克没有恋爱。
Why, Emmy, Jack isn't in love.

1069
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:47,874
你怎么会有这种想法?
Where did you get such an idea?

1070
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:48,959
胡说!
Fiddlesticks!

1071
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:50,502
好吧，我告诉你，他们不是。
Well, I tell you they're not.

1072
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:56,383
我不会告诉你原因什么的，但是他们…他们就是不可能，仅此而已。
I'm not going to tell you why or anything, but they... Well, they just can't be, that's all.

1073
01:08:56,675 --> 01:09:01,596
艾米，你不知道这些事，如果我是你…露西·萨金特，如果你指的是我从未结过婚，
Emmy, you don't know about these things and if I were you... Lucy Sargent, if you're referring to the fact that I never married,

1074
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:05,976
我想指出的是，你不必是一匹马来评判一场马展。
I'd like to point out that you don't have to be a horse to judge a horse show.

1075
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:08,937
如果我曾经见过两个人…嘘!
If ever I saw two people that were... Shh!

1076
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,568
几乎结束了。
Almost over.

1077
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,820
时间过得真快，不是吗?
Gone quickly, hasn't it?

1078
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:18,280
如此之快!
So quickly!

1079
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,825
如果这还不像派克峰那么简单。
If that isn't as plain as Pikes Peak.

1080
01:09:22,117 --> 01:09:23,618
胡说!
Fiddlesticks!

1081
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:27,497
你们都太贴心了。
You've all been so sweet.

1082
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:32,169
不管我们回来后发生什么，都不重要了。
No matter what happens after we get back, it won't matter so much.

1083
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,962
我会有一些美好的回忆。
I'll have some wonderful memories.

1084
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,965
女士们，先生们!
Ladies and gentlemen!

1085
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:45,015
我现在荣幸地祝你新年快乐!
I now have the honor to wish you a happy New Year!

1086
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:56,484
应该忘记旧日的相识吗?
* Should auld acquaintance be forgot * And never brought to mind?

1087
01:09:56,776 --> 01:10:05,118
*应该忘记旧情人吗?*
* Should auld acquaintance be forgot * And auld lang syne? *

1088
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:46,201
晚安，孩子们。甜蜜的梦想。
Good night, children. Sweet dreams.

1089
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,203
我将在7点15分给你吃早餐。
I'll have your breakfast at 7:15.

1090
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,540
你想要什么?法兰绒蛋糕还是炸糊?
What do you want? Flannel cakes or fried mush?

1091
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,417
我想我们还是坐火车吧。
I think we'd ride better on the mush.

1092
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:55,835
好吧。
All right.

1093
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,504
新年快乐。
Happy New Year.

1094
01:10:57,796 --> 01:10:59,047
晚安，艾美。晚安，李。
Good night, Emmy. Good night, Lee.

1095
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:00,131
晚安，艾美阿姨。
Good night, Aunt Emmy.

1096
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,717
晚安，亲爱的。好好休息。
Good night, dear. Get a good rest.

1097
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:04,427
晚安，各位。
Good night.

1098
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,846
谢谢你！谢谢你所做的一切。
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

1099
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:10,100
晚安，杰克。
Good night, Jack.

1100
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:11,851
晚安，李。
Good night, Lee.

1101
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:16,356
晚安，儿子。
Good night, son.

1102
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:18,108
晚安，妈妈。
Good night, Mother.

1103
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,944
祝新年万事如意。
The best of everything to you this New Year.

1104
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,862
谢谢,妈妈。晚安，各位。
Thanks, Mom. Good night.

1105
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,656
晚安，亲爱的。
Good night, dear.

1106
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:45,844
你困了吗?
You sleepy?

1107
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:47,470
不是很。
Not very.

1108
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:50,015
你想去我房间抽根烟吗?
You want to come in my room and have a cigarette?

1109
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:51,641
坐在火旁会很好。
It'd be nice by the fire.

1110
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,643
嗯…
Well...

1111
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:57,564
我马上就来。
I'll be in in a minute.

1112
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,801
进来。
Come in.

1113
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:33,266
很抱歉打扰你，亲爱的，但我知道你明天早上会有多匆忙。
I'm sorry to disturb you, dear, but I know how rushed you're going to be tomorrow morning.

1114
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,976
你没有打扰我。
You're not disturbing me.

1115
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,436
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1116
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:46,529
首先，我想告诉您我们是多么高兴您能和我们在一起，我希望您在这里过得愉快。
First, I want to tell you how glad we are to have had you here with us, and how much I hope you've enjoyed your stay with us.

1117
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,865
你永远不知道有多少。
You'll never know how much.

1118
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:58,500
然后我想告诉你，你遇到麻烦，我是多么难过，我多么希望一切都会好起来。
And then I want to tell you how sorry I am that you're in trouble, and how much I hope everything'll come out all right.

1119
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,507
我不知道你知道这事。
I didn't know you knew about that.

1120
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,846
可怜的孩子，
You poor child,

1121
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:24,776
我现在绝不会跟你提这件事，要不是……嗯…杰克跟你说过他的童年吗?
I never would have mentioned it to you now, only... Well... Did Jack ever tell you anything about his childhood?

1122
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:28,738
不。为什么?
No. Why?

1123
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,826
我丈夫死后，我们家很穷。
We were very poor after my husband died.

1124
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:35,995
事实上，我们一无所有。
In fact, we had nothing.

1125
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:39,999
杰克上学前要做家务，放学后也要做家务。
Jack had to do chores before school and chores after school.

1126
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:47,132
上高中的时候，他下午开送货卡车赚点钱。
And when he was in high school, he drove a delivery truck afternoons to earn a little money.

1127
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:51,636
然后，在做家务之后，他晚上学习，试图进入大学。
Then after chores he studied evenings to try to get into college.

1128
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:57,392
他勤工俭学读完了大学，又勤工俭学读完了法学院。
He worked his way through college and he worked his way through law school.

1129
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:01,855
我并不是想说这有什么不寻常的。
I'm not trying to say that there's anything unusual in that.

1130
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:05,733
此刻，成千上万的男孩正在做同样的事情。
Thousands of boys are doing the same thing this minute.

1131
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:10,572
但我想告诉你，他有多努力才取得今天的成就。
But I am trying to tell you how hard he worked to get where he is today.

1132
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,741
非常非常难。
How very, very hard.

1133
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:20,457
我认为我们现在不应该让任何事情破坏他的兴致。
And I don't think that we should allow anything to spoil it for him now.

1134
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,511
我看不出有什么事会破坏他的兴致，你说呢?
I don't see why anything should spoil it for him, do you?

1135
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,263
他爱上你了。
He's in love with you.

1136
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:37,807
他没有爱上我。
He isn't in love with me.

1137
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:44,314
他对我的兴趣就像你给那些乞丐买顿饭一样。
He's never had any more interest in me than some panhandler you buy a meal for.

1138
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:45,398
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

1139
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,733
当然，我敢肯定。
Of course, I'm sure.

1140
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,116
但他今晚吻了你。
But he kissed you tonight.

1141
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:01,498
好吧,我……我其实并不丑。
Well, I... I'm not exactly ugly.

1142
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:11,883
他可能对我有点发烧，但不会有什么进展，也没有任何进展。
He may have a little fever for me, but it isn't going any further and it hasn't been any place, either.

1143
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:13,968
他不是傻瓜。
He's no fool.

1144
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,763
即使他是
And even if he was,

1145
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:26,564
我不会伤害他，也不会伤害你，艾米阿姨，甚至威利。
I wouldn't hurt him or you, Aunt Emmy, or even Willie.

1146
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,248
谢谢你，亲爱的。
Thank you, dear.

1147
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,385
但你还是爱他的，对吧?
You do love him though, don't you?

1148
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:00,890
恐怕是这样。
I'm afraid so.

1149
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,784
这是你做的饼干。
Here's some of the cookies you made.

1150
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,327
别忘了你是怎么做的。
Don't forget how you made them.

1151
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,413
再见,妈妈。再见，艾美阿姨。
Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye, Aunt Emmy.

1152
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:25,331
再见,约翰。见到你真是太好了。
Goodbye, John. It was awfully nice to see you.

1153
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:26,624
再见。再见,威利。
Goodbye. Goodbye, Willie.

1154
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:27,709
再见,亲爱的。
Goodbye, dear.

1155
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:29,586
再见,威利。再见。
Goodbye, Willie. Goodbye.

1156
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,171
再见，谢谢你所做的一切。
Goodbye, and thank you for everything.

1157
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,132
我永远不会忘记。
I'll never forget it.

1158
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,969
不用谢，亲爱的，有时间就回来吧。
You're quite welcome, dear, and come back whenever you can.

1159
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,224
现在，穿上暖和的衣服。
Now, wrap up and keep good and warm.

1160
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,892
小心开车，孩子。
Drive carefully, son.

1161
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,395
你要经过斯克兰顿还是匹兹堡?
Are you going by way of Scranton or Pittsburgh?

1162
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:49,063
通过加拿大!
Through Canada!

1163
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,107
——再见。——再见。
- Bye. - Goodbye.

1164
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,359
嘿，别忘了写信。
Hey, don't forget to write.

1165
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:00,116
别忘了劈些木头。
Don't you forget to chop some wood.

1166
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:02,076
现在圣诞节结束了。
Now Christmas is over.

1167
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,662
这不是事实吗?
Ain't it the truth.

1168
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,344
您有什么要申报的吗?不。
Have you anything to declare? No.

1169
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:22,764
我在隆隆的座位上放了四瓶中国酒和一桶俄克莱豪酒，但仅此而已。
I have four Chinese and a barrel of okolehao in the rumble seat, but that's all.

1170
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,309
你是哪里人?美国。
And where are you from? United States.

1171
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:27,644
你出生在哪里?印第安纳州。
Where were you born? Indiana.

1172
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,354
你是哪里人?美国。
And where are you from? United States.

1173
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:30,813
你出生在哪里?印第安纳州。
Where were you born? Indiana.

1174
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,774
你来加拿大的原因是什么?
And what is your reason for going through Canada?

1175
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,150
我是个逃犯。
I'm a fugitive from justice.

1176
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,027
你听起来像个疯人院的逃犯。
You sound like a fugitive from a nut house.

1177
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,570
请讲，先生，请讲。
Go ahead, sir. Go ahead.

1178
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:38,696
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1179
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:45,953
你知道吗?
You know something?

1180
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,288
怎么啦？
What?

1181
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,665
你现在在加拿大。
You're in Canada now.

1182
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:50,333
怎么了?
What about it?

1183
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:54,170
如果你明天不想回去，我也没办法逼你。
If you didn't want to go back tomorrow, I couldn't make you.

1184
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,341
你听到我说的话了吗?
Did you hear what I said?

1185
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,426
我听到了。
I heard you.

1186
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,934
你昨晚为什么不进来抽根烟?
Why didn't you come in for that cigarette last night?

1187
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:10,478
我不想抽烟。
I didn't feel like smoking.

1188
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:23,533
我希望你在法庭上看到我的时候不要笑出声来。
I hope you don't bust out laughing when you look at me in court.

1189
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,952
我不太想笑。
I won't feel much like laughing.

1190
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:32,417
你知道吗，有意思的是在法庭上的所有人里，你是唯一一个看起来有心的人。
You know, it's funny that of all the people in the courtroom, you were the only one that seemed to have a heart.

1191
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:33,876
你还以为你是最后一个呢。
You'd think you'd be the last one.

1192
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,087
别相信我。
Don't give me any credit.

1193
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:39,966
我对你耍了个卑鄙的把戏，我觉得有点不好意思，仅此而已。
I played a fairly dirty trick on you and I felt a little bad about it, that's all.

1194
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:41,426
你怎么跟我玩卑鄙的把戏?
How did you play me a dirty trick?

1195
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:44,053
把你的案子推迟到假期之后。
By having your case put over till after the holidays.

1196
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,180
当我看到陪审团要在圣诞节宣判你无罪时。
When I saw the jury was going to acquit you for Christmas.

1197
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:47,765
为什么，你这个狗!
Why, you dog!

1198
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,770
你真是太聪明了。
That was pretty smart of you all right.

1199
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,397
这是生意的一部分。
Part of the business.

1200
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:57,942
那个胖子把我弄出来是因为你良心不安。
Then when that fat slob got me out it was because your conscience was bothering you.

1201
01:18:58,693 --> 01:18:59,610
一点。
A little.

1202
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,573
我一直以为是我的腿。
And all the time I thought it was my legs.

1203
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,408
我都不知道你反对我。
I didn't even know you were against me.

1204
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,078
我就知道你是想把我关进监狱什么的。
I knew you were supposed to be trying to put me in jail or something.

1205
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,039
但是，我不知道，你看起来很温柔。
But, I don't know, you seemed so gentle.

1206
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:14,292
这是技巧的一部分。
That's part of the technique.

1207
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:18,421
如果你不小心对待女人，陪审团里的每个男人都想揍你的鼻子。
If you don't treat a woman with kid gloves, every man on the jury wants to punch you in the nose.

1208
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:22,300
你也得小心翼翼地对付他们，否则你就会得到正确的判决。
You have to handle them with kid gloves, too, or you get it right in the verdict.

1209
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:25,470
把一个女人关进监狱是很难的，不管她做了什么。
It's very hard to put a woman in jail, no matter what she's done.

1210
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:27,597
我应该算是这方面的专家。
I'm supposed to be sort of a specialist at it.

1211
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:29,348
不，你不是。我当然是。
No, you're not. Sure I am.

1212
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,479
你只是想让我恨你这样你给我生意的时候就不会那么难受了，对吧?
You're just trying to make me hate you so you won't feel so bad when you give me the business, aren't you?

1213
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,355
你是，不是吗?
You are, aren't you?

1214
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:40,568
我是认真的。
I mean it.

1215
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:41,944
我希望你不要再说废话了。
I wish you'd stop talking nonsense.

1216
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:43,446
这不是废话。我不是警察。
It isn't nonsense. I'm not a policeman.

1217
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:45,239
你回去不回去与我无关。
It's none of my business whether you go back or not.

1218
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:46,616
不管怎样，我没有钱。
Anyway, I haven't any money.

1219
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:47,992
你不用担心这个。
You wouldn't have to worry about that.

1220
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:52,413
我能想象你的胖朋友如果他付了那五千美元会有多生气。
I can just see the fizz on your fat friend if he had to shell out that five grand.

1221
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,790
你也不用担心这个。
You don't have to worry about that, either.

1222
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,042
如果我想的话，我可以担心。
I can worry about it if I want to.

1223
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:58,503
你是个优秀的地方检察官。
A fine district attorney you are.

1224
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,715
你知道我爱你，对吧?
You know I love you, don't you?

1225
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:04,884
别这么说。
Don't say that.

1226
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:06,761
为什么我不该说呢?
Why shouldn't I say it?

1227
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:09,931
就因为某个珠宝商说你偷了他的手镯吗?
Because some chiseling jeweler claims you swiped one of his bracelets?

1228
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,390
我确实刷过了。
I did swipe it.

1229
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,184
陪审团会告诉你你是否服用了。
The jury will tell you whether you took it or not.

1230
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,228
他拿回来了，不是吗?
He got it back, didn't he?

1231
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,731
不管怎样，你昨天做的和你今天做的是两回事。
Anyway, what you did yesterday and what you do today are two different things.

1232
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:21,901
政府想让你做的就是剥夺别人的财产。
All the state wants you to do is lay off other people's property.

1233
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,904
它不关心这个条件是如何达到的。
It doesn't care how that condition is arrived at.

1234
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,450
一旦你和我在一起，你就不会做那些事了。
Once you were with me, you wouldn't pull any of that stuff.

1235
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:31,035
我可能会。
I might.

1236
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,120
把你的耳朵打趴下。
And get your ears knocked down.

1237
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:35,832
拜托!
Please!

1238
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,792
你爱我，对吧，李?
You love me, don't you, Lee?

1239
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:41,045
不。
No.

1240
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:46,259
我想这就是为什么你那样看着我，那样和我跳舞，那样吻我。
I suppose that's why you've looked at me the way you have and danced with me the way you did and kissed me the way you did.

1241
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:51,722
为什么你的手总是牵着我的手，我的手总是牵着你的手，只要他们在一起。
Why your hand has always found mine and mine has always found yours whenever they're anywhere near each other.

1242
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,563
不要上当受骗。
Don't be a sucker.

1243
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:08,990
当然，你是个英俊的男人，而我只是个普通人，但你说的那些国家不在乎，或者我待在这里，或者我们在一起的时候我会是什么样子，都是胡扯。
Naturally you're a good-looking man and I'm only human, but everything you said about the state not caring, or my staying here, or how I'd be when we were together is the bunk.

1244
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:15,746
你必须记住，你是如何努力工作才取得今天的成就，你是如何在放学后开着卡车，做着家务……我妈妈跟你谈过了，对吧?
You've got to remember how hard you worked to get where you are, and how you drove a truck after school, and did the chores... My mother's been talking to you, hasn't she?

1245
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,708
她为什么不能呢?她有值得骄傲的事。
Why shouldn't she? She's got something to be proud of.

1246
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,838
你也要感到自豪，好好想想，而不是告诉别人逃保释金……
And you've got to be proud and think about it, too, instead of telling people to jump bail and...

1247
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,760
你很清楚……
You know perfectly well that...

1248
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:36,225
不要不公平。
Don't be unfair.

1249
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,269
我爱你，李。
I love you, Lee.

1250
01:21:43,608 --> 01:21:46,485
失去你对我来说太难了。
It'll be awfully hard to lose you.

1251
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:47,862
你知道我希望什么吗?
You know what I wish?

1252
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,280
怎么啦？
What?

1253
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:52,658
我希望案子结束，你被无罪释放。
I wish the case was over and you'd been acquitted.

1254
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,368
那你就不该推迟。
Then you shouldn't have had it postponed.

1255
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,746
这是真的。
That's true.

1256
01:21:57,038 --> 01:21:59,498
但如果我没有，我就不会遇到你。
But if I hadn't, I wouldn't have met you.

1257
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,000
这是真的。
That's true.

1258
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:04,378
案子结束了，你被无罪释放了。
So the case is over and you've been acquitted.

1259
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,504
敲木头。
Knock wood.

1260
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:11,469
然后我拿出一张结婚证…哎呀……然后我们直接走进法官的办公室让他为我们主持婚礼。
And I pull out a marriage license... Gee... And we march right into the Judge's chambers and have him marry us.

1261
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:14,430
你知道你说话像个四岁小孩，对吧?
You know you're talking like a four-year-old, don't you?

1262
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:16,098
你知道我们要去哪里度蜜月吗?
You know where we're going for our honeymoon?

1263
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,433
在哪里?尼亚加拉瀑布。
Where? Niagara Falls.

1264
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,401
但我们现在到了，亲爱的。
But we're there now, darling.

1265
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,387
你疯了，杰克。
You're crazy, Jack.

1266
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:55,513
我以为一切都解决了。
I thought it was all settled.

1267
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,306
那是在尼亚加拉大瀑布。
That was in Niagara Falls.

1268
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,643
人们不用为他们在尼亚加拉大瀑布说的话负责。
People aren't responsible for what they say in Niagara Falls.

1269
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,937
这里是纽约。这是今天，而且……
This is New York. This is today, and...

1270
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:06,565
这是不同的。
This is different.

1271
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,192
就像我艾米阿姨会说的那样，这是一根琴弦。
As my Aunt Emmy would say, fiddlesticks.

1272
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,944
好吧，这不是小提琴。
Well, it isn't fiddlesticks.

1273
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:15,324
首先，他们没有理由放我无罪即使他们放了我也不会嫁给你。
In the first place, there's no reason why they should acquit me and even if they did I wouldn't marry you.

1274
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:16,742
你不再爱我了吗?
Don't you love me anymore?

1275
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:19,996
我从来没有爱过你。
I never loved you.

1276
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:21,372
你在跟我开玩笑吗?
Were you just toying with me?

1277
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:23,290
闭嘴。
Shut up.

1278
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:27,169
你必须对你未来的丈夫表现出更多的礼貌和尊重，否则我将不得不采取强硬措施。
You'll have to develop more courtesy and respect for your future husband, or I shall have to resort to strong measures.

1279
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,547
一个女人，一条狗，一棵山核桃树，你打得越厉害，他们就越厉害
"A woman, a dog, a hickory tree, "the better you beat them, the better they be."

1280
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:31,382
放弃它。你会吗?
Quit it. Will you?

1281
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,884
好吧。怎么啦？
All right. What?

1282
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,430
你知道这是不对的，杰克。
You know it isn't right, Jack.

1283
01:23:37,722 --> 01:23:39,015
你看不见报纸吗?
Can't you see the papers?

1284
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,350
“地方检察官娶了一个骗子。”
"District Attorney marries girl crook."

1285
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:43,853
为什么，我只会伤害你。
Why, I'd only hurt you.

1286
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:46,814
你不记得法官看到我们在那里时的反应了吗?
Don't you remember how the judge acted when he saw us in that place?

1287
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:48,190
但你不会是骗子，你会被无罪释放。
But you won't be a crook, you'll be acquitted.

1288
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:50,109
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

1289
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:53,779
我不知道，但我觉得你机会很大。
Well, I don't know, but I think you've got a good chance.

1290
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,867
你不会做任何事让他们放我无罪，对吧?
You wouldn't do anything to make them acquit me, would you?

1291
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,368
我该怎么办呢?
What could I do?

1292
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,078
那将是一件好事。
That would be a fine thing.

1293
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:08,169
司机，请在下一个街角停一下，好吗?
Driver, stop at the next corner will you, a minute?

1294
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:09,420
我们最好不要一起出去。
We'd better not get out together.

1295
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:12,006
那就太过分了。是的。
That'd be pushing things too far. Yeah.

1296
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,093
祝你好运，亲爱的。谢谢。
Good luck, honey. Thanks.

1297
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:17,470
不要不开心。
Don't be unhappy.

1298
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:21,599
我不是不开心，我只是很困惑。
I'm not unhappy, I'm all confused.

1299
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:24,018
一切都会好的。
Everything's going to come out all right.

1300
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:31,317
结果一定会很好!
It's got to come out all right!

1301
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,072
让我在街区中间下车，好吗?
Let me out in the middle of the block, will you?

1302
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:37,782
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1303
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,581
我告诉你，我确实看到他们了。
I tell you, I did see them.

1304
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,208
在咖啡馆跳舞。
Dancing in a cafe.

1305
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,877
就在他在这个法庭起诉她两小时之后。
Two hours after he was prosecuting her in this very court.

1306
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:51,378
我告诉你，你错了。
And I tell you you're mistaken.

1307
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:52,797
那孩子死在平地上了。
That boy's dead on the level.

1308
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:56,092
如果他不像现在这样诚实，我会说他在政治上很有前途。
And if he weren't quite as honest as he is, I'd say he had a big future in politics.

1309
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:59,261
我站得离他们很近……你忘了你已经是个老头了。
I stood as close to them... You forget that you're an old man.

1310
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:01,222
你的眼睛不像以前那么好了。
Your eyes aren't as good as they used to be.

1311
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:03,432
我对他说话，他回答我。
As it happens, I spoke to him and he answered me.

1312
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,434
任何人都会回答你。那只是一般的礼貌。
Anybody would answer you. That's only common politeness.

1313
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:06,894
我叫他杰克。
I called him Jack.

1314
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:08,521
为什么，有成千上万的人叫杰克。
Why, there are millions of people called Jack.

1315
01:25:08,813 --> 01:25:09,939
你站不住脚。
You haven't got a leg to stand on.

1316
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:11,524
你想立案起诉这个男孩。
You're trying to make a case against this boy.

1317
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,070
都准备好了，法官大人。
All ready, Your Honor.

1318
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,155
马上就来。
Be right in.

1319
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,866
所以我猜你现在认为他会放弃这个案子。
So now I suppose you think he's going to throw the case.

1320
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:22,660
那是你说的，亨利，不是我说的。
Those are your words, Henry, not mine.

1321
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:25,621
我告诉你，就算他在给自己的兄弟打官司他也不会放弃。
I tell you, he wouldn't throw a case if he were trying his own brother.

1322
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:27,373
如果你在法庭上，他不会的。
Not if you're in court, he wouldn't.

1323
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:29,250
好吧，那我在这里听。
All right, then, I'll listen from here.

1324
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:30,501
这就是我想要的。
That's all I wanted.

1325
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,211
还有你的道歉。
That and your apology later.

1326
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:34,380
你会打到猪眼睛里的。
You'll get that in a pig's eye.

1327
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:37,800
听着，听着，听着。
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1328
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:42,096
纽约县最高法院普通会议庭现在开庭。
The Court of General Sessions, Division of the Supreme Court of New York County is now in session.

1329
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:44,098
法官大人，我是沃克法官。
His Honor, Judge Walker, presiding.

1330
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:53,232
你听过凯因梅茨医生描述过这种被称为“催眠猝倒”的情况吗?
You heard Dr. Keinmetz describe the condition known as hypnoleptic catalepsies?

1331
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:54,650
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1332
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:58,154
你认为这就是你当时的状况吗?
Would you say that is the condition you were in?

1333
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,030
我想是的。是的,先生。
I guess so. Yes, sir.

1334
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:02,950
这是所有。
That's all.

1335
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:07,496
请稍等，利安德小姐。
Just a moment, please, Miss Leander.

1336
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:15,880
你说你离开珠宝店走第五大道的时候被催眠了。
Now, you said that you were hypnotized at the time you left the jewelry store and walked up 5th Avenue.

1337
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:17,173
不是吗?
Didn't you?

1338
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,384
嗯…你到底有没有?
Well... Did you or didn't you?

1339
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:21,677
我的律师是这么说的。
Well, my lawyer said so.

1340
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,053
你的律师这么说的?
Your lawyer said so?

1341
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:27,766
那么我们是否可以理解你和你的律师对发生的事情意见不一致?
Are we to understand then that you and your lawyer do not agree exactly as to what happened?

1342
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:30,144
别回答那个问题!
Don't answer that question!

1343
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:36,358
我反对，法官大人!这个问题非常不恰当，无关紧要，无关紧要，我要求将其从记录中删除。
I object, Your Honor! The question is highly improper, irrelevant, immaterial, and I ask it be stricken from the record.

1344
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:37,651
持续。
Sustained.

1345
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,445
陪审团将忽略这个问题。
The jury will disregard the question.

1346
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,740
你是不是被催眠了?
Were you hypnotized or weren't you?

1347
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:44,909
我想……我们不想听你的猜测。
I suppose... We don't want your suppositions.

1348
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:47,369
我们想知道你是不是被催眠了。
We want to know whether you were hypnotized or not.

1349
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:48,495
是的。
Yes.

1350
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:49,788
是的什么?
Yes what?

1351
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,373
我想我是被催眠了。
I guess I was hypnotized.

1352
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:53,167
你猜你被催眠了?
You guess you were hypnotized?

1353
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,669
一开始你以为自己被催眠了，现在你又觉得自己被催眠了。
First you suppose you were hypnotized and now you guess you were.

1354
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:57,546
请记住你是发过誓的，利安德小姐。
Kindly remember you are under oath, Miss Leander.

1355
01:26:57,838 --> 01:26:59,048
你知道作伪证的处罚吗?
Do you know the penalty for perjury?

1356
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,050
-我反对，法官阁下——持续。
- I object, Your Honor. - Sustained.

1357
01:27:01,342 --> 01:27:06,805
别那么粗鲁，杰克。我告诉过你多少次，当你和一个女人一起工作时…到底是哪一个呢?猜测还是假设?
Not so rough, Jack. How many times have I told you when you're working with a woman... Well, which is it? A guess or a supposition?

1358
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,557
他为什么这么强硬?
What's he getting so tough about?

1359
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,351
他天生就是刻薄的。
He's just naturally mean.

1360
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:13,229
我接手了一个谋杀案，他们没那么粗暴。
I sat on a murder case and they didn't get that rough.

1361
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:18,108
法官大人，这些陪审员又在喋喋不休了。
Your Honor, these jurors are gabbing again.

1362
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:23,405
陪审员们将停止窃窃私语，把全部注意力放在手头的案子上。
The jurors will cease whispering and give their entire attention to the case at hand.

1363
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:29,370
继续。利安德小姐，你能告诉我们被催眠是什么感觉吗?
Proceed. Miss Leander, will you kindly tell us how it feels to be hypnotized?

1364
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:31,664
——对象。——持续。
- Object. - Sustained.

1365
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,834
你几岁开始偷东西的?
How old were you when you began to steal things?

1366
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:38,379
——对象。——持续。
- Object. - Sustained.

1367
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:39,755
那和这件事有什么关系?
What's that got to do with this?

1368
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:41,382
只是想把她弄糊涂。
Just trying to get her in wrong.

1369
01:27:41,674 --> 01:27:43,884
法官大人，那些陪审员又来了。
Your Honor, those jurors are at it again.

1370
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:46,679
萨金特先生。
Mr. Sargent.

1371
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,683
我完全有能力在没有律师的情况下管理这个法庭。
I am perfectly capable of running this courtroom without prompting from counsel.

1372
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:56,563
如果陪审员中再有人窃窃私语，我就判他们藐视法庭。
If there's any more whispering among the jurors, I'll hold the offenders in contempt.

1373
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,567
现在继续这个案子。
Now proceed with this case.

1374
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,406
你被美丽的珠宝催眠过多少次?
How many times have you been hypnotized by beautiful jewelry?

1375
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,700
对象。我想是很多次吧。
Object. I guess quite a lot of times.

1376
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:10,452
请不要在我反对之后再回答问题。
Please don't answer questions after I've objected to them.

1377
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:11,870
反对持续。
Objection sustained.

1378
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:14,498
陪审团将忽略问题和答案。
The jury will disregard the question and the answer.

1379
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:18,627
你听过凯因梅兹医生对催眠的看法吗?
Did you hear Dr. Keinmetz's opinion about hypnotism?

1380
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:22,423
请你回答我的问题，不要让我们在这里等一整天好吗?
Will you kindly answer my question and not keep us waiting here all day?

1381
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:26,802
你能回答我的问题吗?
Will you answer my question?

1382
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:36,395
法官大人，如果证人拒绝回答我的问题我也无能为力了。
Your Honor, if the witness refuses to answer my questions there's nothing more I can do.

1383
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:38,522
请囚犯回答律师的问题。
The prisoner will please answer counsel's question.

1384
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,399
我可以把手帕借给你吗?
May I lend you my handkerchief?

1385
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:43,110
你的荣誉……请把你的答案写在这里给我。
Your Honor... Kindly address your answers to me over here.

1386
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:46,322
法官大人，我想请求…法官大人，我觉得这位女士身体不太好。
Your Honor, I want to plead... Your Honor, I don't believe this young lady is well.

1387
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:47,906
我想五分钟的休庭应该是……但我想认罪。
I think a five-minute recess would be... But I want to plead guilty.

1388
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:51,035
毫无疑问，是我让她……拜托,杰克。你的荣誉!
I am undoubtedly responsible for having made her... Please, Jack. Your Honor!

1389
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:52,202
休庭几分钟，法官大人。
Just a few minutes recess, Your Honor.

1390
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:56,206
这个年轻女人歇斯底里。很明显，她正处于一种情绪的痛苦之中，在这种情绪中，她对自己说的话不负责。
This young woman is hysterical... She's quite obviously in the throes of an emotion during which she's not responsible for what she says.

1391
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,584
我很好。我只想认罪。
I'm all right. I just want to plead guilty.

1392
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:02,880
法官大人，请允许我们休庭五分钟。
If Your Honor would kindly grant a five-minute recess.

1393
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:05,424
我的孩子，你为什么要认罪?
My child, why do you want to plead guilty?

1394
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,136
因为我有罪。
Because I am guilty.

1395
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:11,722
当你犯了错误，你就得为此付出代价。
And when you make a mistake you've got to pay for it.

1396
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:14,516
否则，你永远学不会。
Otherwise, you never learn.

1397
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:17,686
法官大人，很明显这不是正常行为。
Your Honor, it must be apparent this is not normal conduct.

1398
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:23,025
很明显。国家也不希望利用暂时的失常作为愚蠢的……这不是暂时的。
Quite apparent. And the state has no wish to take advantage of a temporary aberration as stupid... There isn't anything temporary about this.

1399
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:25,694
你能看出来我脑子是正常的，对吧?
You can see that I'm in my right mind, can't you?

1400
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,742
既然这样，那就没什么可说的了。
Well, in that case, there's nothing more to be said.

1401
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:38,832
现在开庭时间定在下周五，1月6日，上午10点。
The court at this time will set next Friday, January the 6th, at 10:00 a.m.

1402
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:40,501
作为通过判决的时间。
as time for passing sentence.

1403
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:45,339
犯人被还押到市监狱。
The prisoner is remanded to the city jail.

1404
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:50,177
谢谢你，法官大人。
Thank you, Your Honor.

1405
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,903
我以为审判至少要持续一个星期。
I thought the trial would last at least a week.

1406
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,785
陪审团解散。
The jury is dismissed.

1407
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:26,255
好吗?
Well?

1408
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:29,133
我不知道。
I don't know.

1409
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:47,734
妇女吗?
Matron?

1410
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:53,991
你知道你做了什么吗?
Do you know what you've done?

1411
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:56,660
你知道这是无法挽回的吗?
Do you realize it can't be undone?

1412
01:30:56,952 --> 01:31:01,081
你知道没有上诉，没有重审，没有无效审判，只有监狱!
You understand there's no appeal, no retrial, no mistrial, nothing but jail!

1413
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:02,207
我能得到多长时间?
How long will I get?

1414
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:03,333
我怎么知道?
How do I know?

1415
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:09,506
也许你活不了多久，但如果你闭上你的陷阱，你就根本不用去了。
Maybe you won't get very long, but if you'd kept your trap shut you wouldn't have to go at all.

1416
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:11,675
没有别的事可做了。
There wasn't anything else to do.

1417
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:13,927
你还不明白吗?
Don't you see?

1418
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:19,266
你很坚强，也很会辩，而我…我很爱你。
You're so strong, and you argue so well and I... I love you so much.

1419
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:20,976
你确实证明了这一点。
You certainly proved that.

1420
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:24,354
我总是做你想做的事，即使这对你不好。
I'd always do what you wanted, even if it wasn't good for you.

1421
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:29,651
我永远不会有机会对抗你而你也永远不会有机会和我在一起。
I'd never have a chance against you and you'd never have a chance with me.

1422
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:33,155
就像刚才，你差点输掉官司的时候。
Like just now, when you were trying to lose the case.

1423
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,116
你不觉得羞耻吗?
Aren't you ashamed?

1424
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,701
废话。
Hogwash.

1425
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:39,870
我知道你想干什么。
I know what you were trying to do.

1426
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:43,999
把小威利的事业从坏女人手里拯救出来。
Save little Willie's career from the bad, bad woman.

1427
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:49,588
你这个可怜的笨蛋，难道你不认为我是最能判断什么对我好，什么是我在这个世界上最想要的吗?
You poor sap, don't you think I'm the best judge of what's good for me and what I want most in this world?

1428
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,881
不。
No.

1429
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:54,468
当你摆出高贵姿态的时候，你有没有想过你伤我有多深?
And when you were making your grand gesture, did you stop to think how much you were hurting me?

1430
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:59,890
你以为我不会再爱你了就因为他们把你和一群徒步旅行者和瘾君子关在一起几年吗?
Do you think I'm going to stop loving you just because they lock you up with a bunch of hikers and hopheads for a few years?

1431
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:01,266
我也好不到哪里去。
I'm not much better.

1432
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,018
你配得上我。
You're good enough for me.

1433
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:12,694
你什么时候来看我好吗?
Will you come and see me sometime?

1434
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:14,696
来看你吗?
Come and see you?

1435
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:18,116
我现在就去找法官，给你主持婚礼。
I'm going to send for the judge and marry you right now.

1436
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:29,044
不过还是要谢谢你。
But thank you just the same.

1437
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,048
如果你之后还想要我。
If you still wanted me afterwards.

1438
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:41,056
这样我就扯平了，你就有足够的时间考虑了。
I'd be all square and you would have had plenty of time to think things over.

1439
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:43,892
很多事情。
Lots of things.

1440
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:59,408
将……当他们判决我的时候，你会站在我身边握着我的手吗?
Will... Will you stand beside me and hold my hand when they sentence me?

1441
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:01,827
当然，我会的。
Of course, I will.

1442
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,084
那我就不会害怕了。
Then I won't be afraid.

1443
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,256
我如此爱你。
I love you so.
