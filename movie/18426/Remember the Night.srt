1
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:54,706
Glorious, madam, isn't it?

2
00:00:54,897 --> 00:00:56,397
Mmmm, yes.

3
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:00,269
Could I see that one down there, please?

4
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,589
Why, yes, indeed, madam. By all means.

5
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,916
Mr. Meyer. Mr. Meyer!

6
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:16,394
Mr. Meyer! Mr. Meyer!
Mr. Meyer! Mr. Meyer!

7
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:56,930
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

8
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:00,929
What's this?

9
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:04,053
Some dame cops a bracelet out of Meyer
& Company and hocks it on 3rd Avenue.

10
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,226
- Open and shut.
- First offense?

11
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:07,614
Nah, she's got a record.
This is her third offense.

12
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,759
Good, good. A first offender at
Christmastime is tougher than tiger meat.

13
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:14,273
Conviction's only 78 percent
as against 82 percent last year.

14
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,834
Can I handle this case, boss?
I'll getcha a conviction--

15
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,944
Oh, you could probably handle it
as well as some of these dopes.

16
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:21,315
When the right case comes
along, I'll give it to you.

17
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:23,211
Wife beater or something like that.

18
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:25,573
Your face isn't right to prosecute a woman.

19
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:27,701
- Awwww...
- Get me Sargent!

20
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,055
What's his face got that mine hasn't got?

21
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,684
I don't know. But whatever it is,
he hasn't lost a case for me yet.

22
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,920
Yassuh... Yassuh...

23
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:38,986
Well, if this is de office,
he's already lef'.

24
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,871
I didn't say to say that, you dumbbell.

25
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,482
Oh my, no, this isn't his office.

26
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,953
You just tell him that a young woman
wants to make an appointment with him.

27
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:51,434
Uh, uh, this isn't de office. A young
woman wants to make a appointment wid ya.

28
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:55,503
Just a minute.

29
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:01,503
Uh, who all wants to
speak to Master Sargent?

30
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:04,076
Your boss.

31
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,052
It's a good thing you didn't
take up the stage for a living.

32
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,261
I'll see you down here in 15 minutes.

33
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,978
Now, wait a minute. You told me when
I finished up the Mathews case, I--

34
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,615
But I got 750 miles to drive.

35
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,955
Your mother sure's gonna be mad.

36
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,551
Oh sure, and fall asleep at
the wheel and get croaked.

37
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:21,720
Well, who's defending?

38
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:23,213
O'Leary.

39
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:24,820
Aw, that windbag, huh?

40
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:27,486
He'll give us the Gettysburg Address and
the Declaration of Independence and the--

41
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,892
I'll have Tom meet you in court, and
you'll be out of there by noon.

42
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,057
Kindly remember who you're talking to...

43
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:34,476
...and leave the pigs out of it.

44
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:40,670
...during the course of this trial to
prove that an invaluable bracelet...

45
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,787
...was taken from the premises of
Meyer & Company by the defendant.

46
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,899
I don't like the smile on that jury's pan.

47
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:51,276
All juries get softhearted at Christmas,
Tommy. If you ever get a case to prosecute...

48
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:54,013
...and you see that "peace on earth, good
will toward men" look come in their eyes...

49
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:54,878
...get a continuance.

50
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:58,126
How flimsy is this argument?

51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,673
Oh, this is a waste of time,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

52
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,465
Of your time and mine.

53
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,678
Time we could spend to much better advantage
in last-minute Christmas shopping.

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,067
I know that's what I'd like to be doing.

55
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,809
May it please the Court,
we object, Your Honor.

56
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,994
The jury's Christmas shopping has
nothing to do with the case.

57
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,352
Objection sustained.

58
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:21,608
The jury will disregard Mr. O'Leary's
tempting allusion to Christmas shopping.

59
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:24,305
Quite obviously, we'd all like
to be Christmas shopping.

60
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,474
I withdraw the allusion, Your Honor.

61
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,311
When I say there has
been a waste of time...

62
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:34,285
...I mean that the State has
gone to great lengths...

63
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:40,839
...to prove that Anna-Rose Malone,
sometimes known as Lee Leander...

64
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:42,243
Sometimes known as a
lot of other things...

65
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:46,716
...did on the afternoon of December
3rd walk out upon 5th Avenue...

66
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:50,812
...with a bracelet which was still
the property of Meyer & Company...

67
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:53,988
...to prove something she freely admits.

68
00:04:54,434 --> 00:05:00,601
As if the proof of that fact
constituted proof of guilt!

69
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:02,842
The truth is simple.

70
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,690
The bracelet was removed during a
temporary loss of will and consciousness...

71
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:12,279
...now known as schizophrenia...

72
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:16,824
...but formerly known as...

73
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:18,307
...hypnotism!

74
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,466
This young girl...

75
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,424
What do you mean, you're
not gonna object?

76
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,735
Shut up. He's just postponed
the case till after Christmas.

77
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:26,109
How'd you figure that?

78
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:28,445
Hypnotism.

79
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:31,998
The salesman showed her the bracelet...

80
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:35,154
...urged her to clasp it on her wrist...

81
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:39,520
...begged her to examine it
under a more powerful light...

82
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:43,028
...and then he excused himself.

83
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:47,841
Now, it's an old trick,
this tempting of the poor.

84
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:51,726
They say, 'Take it home and
wear it for a few days.'

85
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:56,450
They say, 'Drive it around this
afternoon, bring it back tomorrow.'

86
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:59,184
'Ha! Buy it all on your own terms!'

87
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:06,059
Consider the jewel scene between
Mephistopheles and Marguerite in "Faust"!

88
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,726
I hope he isn't gonna sing it.

89
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:10,949
The bracelet is under a powerful light.

90
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:15,058
The young girl stares at it.

91
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:17,094
Closer.

92
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,426
Closer.

93
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:24,981
The great central stone flashes
blindingly in her eyes...

94
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:30,704
...blue, green, purple, orange!

95
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,920
Suddenly, the colors are gone.

96
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,083
All is darkness.

97
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,129
Well, what is this?
Where is the shop?

98
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,462
Where is the light she was under?

99
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:49,368
What is she doing on 5th Avenue,
blocks away from Meyer & Company?

100
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:55,778
With a thrill of heart, she feels
at her wrist, not daring to look.

101
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:57,767
No doubt about it.

102
00:06:58,296 --> 00:06:59,296
Then, panic!

103
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:03,092
She turns and hurries towards
the great jewelry store.

104
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:05,153
Will they believe her?

105
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,534
Fear turns her legs to lead.

106
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,879
One block, two blocks.

107
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,832
She goes blindly, moving into strangers
who think she must be crazy.

108
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:20,648
Six blocks. Ah, there at last
is the great jewelry store...

109
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,918
...its windows blazing with gems!

110
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:26,189
But no, the gems are gone...

111
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,483
...the windows almost bare.

112
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,299
With a sinking heart,
she tries the lock.

113
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:36,739
It's closed.

114
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:41,049
Meyer & Company have closed for the night.

115
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:46,617
Ain'tcha gonna do somethin'?
That jury's sold right now.

116
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:47,711
Shhh. Wait.

117
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,886
What was she to do?

118
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:54,370
What would you do, madam?

119
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:58,369
That's certainly a terrible spot to be in.
I-I suppose I...

120
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,779
The counsel will refrain from
questioning the jurors...

121
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:05,427
...and the jurors will
refrain from answering.

122
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,334
Never heard of such a thing.

123
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:12,834
I beg the Court and jury's pardon.
I was carried away.

124
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,195
What was she to do?

125
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,261
What was she to do?

126
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,751
Suddenly, an inspiration.
The telephone book!

127
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:26,108
S.A. Meyer & Company, S.A.
Meyer & Company, S...

128
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,869
S. A. Meyer must live somewhere,
but he doesn't seem to.

129
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,630
Maybe it's Long Island!

130
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:36,722
S.A. Meyer, S.A. Meyer, S--
Ah, here he is!

131
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:41,119
S.A. Meyer, 324 Woodmere
Road, Roslyn, Long Island.

132
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:45,246
I'll take the first train to Long Island.
I'll be there at dinner time.

133
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,979
He'll believe me. He's got to believe me!

134
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,661
He should've been on the stage.

135
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:50,879
He was.

136
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:53,145
But it takes money to go to Long Island.

137
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:58,331
Where will I get the money to go to Long
Island and tell Mr. Meyer what happened?

138
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:03,862
Then, a crazy idea. I'll hock the bracelet
to get the money to go to Long Island.

139
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:05,705
Quick, a hock shop!

140
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,443
Quick, Watson, the needle.

141
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:12,597
Ah, here we are. A
nice, cozy pawnbroker.

142
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,398
A friend of the poor.

143
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:17,693
May I get some money on this, please?

144
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:21,512
Well, well, I should say
you could, young woman.

145
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,539
Where did you get this piece?

146
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,127
Well, never mind where I got it.
I want some money on it quick.

147
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:30,018
Now, now, now, now, now, take it easy.
Everything is going to be all right.

148
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:35,566
Just step in, please.

149
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,107
A little further.

150
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:42,353
Bang! Lock that door while
I keep her in here!

151
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,752
Ooh, let me out of here!

152
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:46,169
Oh, you're gonna get it, all right.

153
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:48,406
Hello, get me the police department.

154
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,783
Hello, I've got the thief
what robbed Meyer & Company!

155
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:59,157
The defense rests.

156
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:09,008
The hypothesis of hypnotism
is a very interesting one.

157
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,666
Let me be the first to admit it.

158
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,172
But, unfortunately, I am no Svengali.

159
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,820
Nor are you, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.

160
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,733
The People of the State of
New York will require...

161
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:20,393
...the expert testimony of Dr.
Keinmetz, the psychiatrist.

162
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,762
Who, I am sorry to say, is spending
his Christmas vacation in Florida.

163
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:27,370
Well, uh, what do you
want to do about this?

164
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:29,034
I object, Your Honor!

165
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:31,577
How can you object to something
he has not yet said?

166
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:33,228
Because I know what
he's going to say.

167
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,512
With your kind permission, counsel.

168
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:39,283
Since the defense counsel has interjected a
new element which was not testified to...

169
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:41,359
...the State asks permission
to reopen the case...

170
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:43,689
...for the purpose of allowing
the testimony of Dr. Keinmetz...

171
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:45,749
...and for the request of a
continuance to be granted...

172
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:48,397
...till after the Christmas
holidays when he will be available.

173
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,310
I object.

174
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:52,066
The defense has summed up, the
case is practically closed.

175
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,693
Objection overruled.

176
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,471
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

177
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,837
...you are again admonished not
to converse among yourselves...

178
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:02,246
...nor with anyone else
connected with this trial.

179
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:06,411
Nor are you to form or express any
opinion concerning this case...

180
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:08,122
...until it is finally submitted to you.

181
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:13,066
The defendant will remain in custody
subject to giving a $5,000 bond.

182
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:18,309
All jurors, parties and witnesses in this
case are instructed to return to the Court...

183
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,513
...Tuesday, January 3rd, at 10 a.m.

184
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,212
Court is adjourned.

185
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:27,374
And, uh, a very merry Christmas to you all.

186
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:32,717
That was a dirty trick you played on me.
It means another day in court.

187
00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:35,903
I'm not working for the State.
I have to earn my money.

188
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:36,857
No sense of humor.

189
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:38,402
Merry Christmas, Francis.

190
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:41,509
Boy, if that wasn't the neatest
fake reverse I ever saw...

191
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:43,591
Yeah, he fell for that one
like a horse down a coal hole.

192
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:47,126
A fine mess you've gotten me into. I thought
I was gonna be outta here for Christmas!

193
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:49,469
- Well, all you gotta do is post a bond.
- How can I post a bond?

194
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:52,390
I haven't any more money, and I
don't wanna spend Christmas in jail.

195
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,012
Please don't let them do that.

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
What do you mean, you
haven't got any more money?

197
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,829
What have I been talking
for, to hear my own voice?

198
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,922
If you hadn't talked so much,
I'd be out of here by now.

199
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,617
- What do you mean by that?
- Oh, hypnotism.

200
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:03,291
That gag's so old, it's got whiskers.

201
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:05,832
Please don't let them keep
me here over Christmas.

202
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,970
Well, what could you do if you were
out? You haven't got any money.

203
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:11,136
- I could walk around, couldn't I?
- It ain't gonna be as bad as all that.

204
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:15,050
- You'll get a nice little room and a nice--
- Yeah, yeah, never mind the build-up.

205
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,676
He thinks he's taking me to the Ritz.

206
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:19,889
I hope you have a merry Christmas.

207
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:28,715
On your way out, send Fat Mike in here.

208
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:31,206
Fat Mike, the bondsman?

209
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,083
If you know any other Fat
Mikes, you can send them, too.

210
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:35,669
I get it.

211
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,639
You don't, but let it pass.

212
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:52,825
- You wanna see me?
- Yeah. You got a match?

213
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:56,199
A match? Why, sure I got a match.
I got a flock of 'em.

214
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:00,769
I, uh, I, uh... Well,
whaddaya know about that?

215
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:04,408
I could've swore... I remember.
I gave 'em to Elmer.

216
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,851
- You know, he come to me and he says--
- Well, never mind.

217
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,145
How much would you charge for
5,000 bail till January 3rd?

218
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,845
- Did they pin somethin' on you, pal?
- No, no, it's not for me.

219
00:13:13,004 --> 00:13:15,304
- It's for the young lady who was here today.
- Oh.

220
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,942
- How much?
- Well, for a friend of yours...

221
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:20,914
Not a red Samelka.

222
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:24,810
- I'm not asking any favors.
- Favors? Ha! It's a privilege.

223
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,211
- You still live in the same place?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:32,270
- How soon do you want her out?
- Right away.

225
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:33,502
She's out.

226
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:35,715
Thanks.

227
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:45,887
Oh, me...

228
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,140
- Uh, yassuh?
- Is the big boss in?

229
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,126
He's in but he ain't home.

230
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,886
Save that for your radio act.

231
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:09,472
Come on in. Just tell the big
boss that she's here, that's all.

232
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,048
With the compliments of Fat Mike.
You got that?

233
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,079
Y-Y-Yassuh, Mr. Mike.

234
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,741
Not Mr. Mike. Fat Mike.

235
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,553
Y-Y-Yassuh, Mister F-F-Fat Mi-Mike.

236
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:24,154
Okay, toots. I'll see ya in court.

237
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:32,952
W-W-Won't you sit down? Please?

238
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:44,095
Well, what's the matter now?

239
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,448
- She's here.
- Who's here?

240
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,690
- I don't know, sir.
- Then how do you know she's here?

241
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,600
- Well, I seed her come in.
- You seed who come in?

242
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,261
De lady?

243
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,274
- You mean there's a lady in the apartment?
- Yassuh.

244
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,732
What'd you let her in for? I told
you I wasn't home to anybody.

245
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,111
I told him dat, but he shoved
de door open anyhow...

246
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,923
...and pushed de lady on
in wid his compliments.

247
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,600
- Who did?
- Uh, Fat Ike?

248
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,467
Fat Ike? You mean Fat Mike?

249
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:17,303
Yassuh. He sho' ain't no Thin Ike.

250
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:34,101
- Oh. How do you do?
- Hello.

251
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:38,964
- What are you doing here?
- I dunno yet, but I've got a rough idea.

252
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,146
- Well, I'm glad you're out and--
- Now, what do I have to do for it?

253
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,874
Well, for one thing, you
might say 'Thank you'...

254
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,732
...but if that doesn't fit in
with your plans, just skip it.

255
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:50,486
- My motives in this matter--
- Scotch and soda?

256
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:54,337
Thanks.

257
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,325
One of these days one of you boys is going
to start one of these scenes differently...

258
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:04,889
... and one of us girls is going
to drop dead from surprise.

259
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:06,625
No doubt. Now, if you'll tell me--

260
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:09,634
I, uh... I suppose you do this
with all the lady prisoners?

261
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,274
Oh my, yes. My life is just
one long round of whoopee.

262
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:13,407
You're in a good spot for it.

263
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:16,912
Wonderful. I merely have to raise my finger
and my slightest whim is satisfied.

264
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,593
- Now, if you'll--
- And I suppose if anybody says no...

265
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:22,074
- ...you just put 'em right back in the cooler.
- That's right.

266
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:26,435
Look. When court reconvenes I'll try my best
to put you in jail for a good long time.

267
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:28,404
That's my business. But you
haven't been convicted yet...

268
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,837
...so I don't see why you shouldn't
enjoy Christmas like the rest of us.

269
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:33,916
- That's why I had Mike get you out.
- And bring me up here.

270
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,190
- I did not ask him to bring you up here.
- Then why did that gorilla bring me up here?

271
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:40,445
- Because he's got a mind like a sewer.
- Thanks.

272
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:45,554
Now, look. I'm very glad to have been
of service to you, but now if you'll--

273
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,990
You mean I don't have to stay
here if I don't want to?

274
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:50,683
You most certainly do not.

275
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,306
Then I'll stay.

276
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,685
- But I won't be forced.
- Hey, now wait a minute...

277
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:01,045
You know, there's nothing as
dangerous as a square shooter.

278
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,513
If all men were like you, there
wouldn't be any nice girls left.

279
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:07,065
Yeah. Well, all this is leading into a very
interesting and deep-dish discussion...

280
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:08,507
...which I haven't time
to pursue at the moment.

281
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,827
I'm leaving on a little trip and as it's quite a
drive and I haven't had my dinner yet, I--

282
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:17,783
- Oh. You mean you want me to go.
- Well, yes.

283
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,371
- Where?
- Where, what?

284
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:24,253
Well, after all, I was on my way
to a nice, comfortable jail...

285
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:26,616
...with three meals a day and
turkey for Christmas. And now I--

286
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,966
- Don't you live someplace?
- Nh-nh.

287
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:31,294
Well, where have you been living?
In a tree or something?

288
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,218
Oh, I had a room in a hotel,
but they locked me out.

289
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,963
Ah. And how much do
you owe at the hotel?

290
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,447
Um, a hundred and twenty-
six dollars and forty cents.

291
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:44,605
Oh. Well, that doesn't solve
any problems, does it?

292
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,193
Well, why don't you just put me back in the
clink? That'll solve a lot of problems.

293
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,286
I'm not sure that I can, and--
Well, that wasn't the idea.

294
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,026
- Have you had dinner?
- Not yet.

295
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,873
Well, come on, I'll buy you that
Christmas dinner I cheated you out of...

296
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,372
...and maybe we can figure out something.
Rufus, get my coat, will ya?

297
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:07,644
Yassuh, Mr. Sargent.

298
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:12,297
I'm just spreadin' y'all a few sandwiches, in
case you get hungry in de middle of de ride.

299
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:15,784
You really didn't want me
to come up here at all, then?

300
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,268
I'm sorry to say I did not.

301
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:27,221
Hot dawg! But don't forget
you gotta go see your maw.

302
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,175
Of course, I could lend you
my apartment while I'm away.

303
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:08,070
- That sounds like a play, doesn't it?
- Yeah. Sounds like a flop. No, thanks.

304
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:12,401
Oh, don't worry about me. I can always
chisel a hotel for a week or so.

305
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:14,228
That's a nice, cheesy idea.

306
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:19,561
Well, I'm not going to sleep in the subway.
And as far as the holiday is concerned...

307
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:21,946
...I guess I'll get plenty of that
when you get through with me.

308
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,853
Oh, uh, not that I mean it in a
disagreeable way, you understand?

309
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,513
- I understand.
- Your business is your business.

310
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:37,885
Of course, some people wouldn't
care for that kind of business...

311
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:41,424
...but, uh, somebody has
to do the dirty work.

312
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:45,569
It's just too bad it had to
be somebody as nice as you.

313
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:52,429
- How long have you been swiping things?
- Always.

314
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:55,331
- Did you ever get caught before?
- Mh-hm.

315
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:58,731
- Did you take things you didn't need?
- Sure.

316
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,784
In the presence of beautiful things, did
you have the sudden irresistible urge...

317
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:04,013
...to take them in your hands
and hurry away with them?

318
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:05,878
You mean, was I hypnotized?

319
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:11,513
- No, no, I mean, maybe you're a kleptomaniac.
- Oh, no. No. They tried that, though.

320
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:15,095
No. You see, to be a kleptomaniac, you
can't sell any of the stuff afterwards...

321
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,010
...or you'll lose your amateur standing.

322
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,960
You know, I can't understand it.

323
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:20,544
First you think it's heredity and...

324
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,558
...then you get some guy with several
generations of clergymen behind them.

325
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:27,886
I don't think you ever could understand
because your mind is different.

326
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,346
Right or wrong is the same
for everybody, you see...

327
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:33,348
...but the rights and the
wrongs aren't the same.

328
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,897
- Like, in China, they eat dogs.
- That's a lot of piffle.

329
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,450
- They do eat dogs!
- No, no, I mean your theory.

330
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,007
Oh. Well, um--

331
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,542
Try it like this.

332
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:48,206
- Supposing you were starving to death...
- Mh-hm.

333
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,892
...and you didn't have any food
and you didn't have any money...

334
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:53,204
...and you didn't have any
place to get anything...

335
00:20:53,623 --> 00:20:55,890
...and there were some loaves of
bread out in front of a market.

336
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:00,297
Now, remember, you're starving to death.
And the man's back was turned.

337
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:02,832
Would you swipe one?

338
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:05,139
You bet I would.

339
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:07,602
That's because you're honest.

340
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:10,239
You see, I'd have a six-course dinner
at the table d'hôte across the street...

341
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:13,275
...and then say I'd forgotten my purse.
Get the difference?

342
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,520
Yeah. Your way's smarter.

343
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:21,094
That's it. We're smart.

344
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:28,844
- Hello, Jack. How are you?
- Oh. Good evening.

345
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:32,829
I want you to meet my wife. My dear,
this is John Sargent and, uh--

346
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:36,559
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do? This is Miss Huh-huh.

347
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,911
I'm so sorry. I didn't
catch the name.

348
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:41,127
- Well, I'm--
- I'm so sorry, Jack, we must hurry...

349
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:45,872
I never thought of that.

350
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:50,354
Gee, you're sweet. You never
think of anything wrong, do you?

351
00:21:52,954 --> 00:21:55,054
Now, let's have a nightcap,
and then I gotta get going.

352
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,587
A couple of B&Bs, and will you have
the band play "My Indiana Home"?

353
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:00,627
Yes, sir.

354
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:05,626
Here's that turkey dinner I owe you, and
a room, and a couple of breakfasts.

355
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:08,809
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

356
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:14,087
You wouldn't wanna dance
with me again, would you?

357
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:15,496
Isn't that asking for trouble?

358
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:18,627
I mean I might step on your feet again.

359
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:22,781
A couple of more crunches aren't
going to hurt them at this stage.

360
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:46,994
- Why did you have them play this piece?
- Cause that's where I'm going.

361
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:50,454
- No! Are you a Hoosier?
- Sure. Wabash, Indiana.

362
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:55,571
- That is, a farm just outside of Wabash.
- Wabash, Indiana? No wonder I liked you.

363
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:57,624
- I'm from Eltonville.
- No!

364
00:22:58,072 --> 00:23:00,472
- Why, that's only about 50 miles from Wabash.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:04,616
Well, I'll be darned. Think we had
to come here and meet like this.

366
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:24,806
- I go home every Christmas.
- You do?

367
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,854
My mother still runs the farm.
She does all right, too.

368
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:32,849
- Raises Partridge Wyandottes, Poland Chinas--
- Oh, we never had anything that swell.

369
00:23:32,949 --> 00:23:34,149
We didn't either until just lately.

370
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:36,988
How long since you've been home?

371
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,519
Never.

372
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:41,887
Why?

373
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:43,729
I ran away.

374
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:47,868
I don't know what the
circumstances were, of course.

375
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:50,122
Not so hot.

376
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,569
Well, time takes care of those things.

377
00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:56,173
Your folks write to you?

378
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,010
I had a letter from my
mother when my father died.

379
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,914
Your mother's alive, then?

380
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:02,935
I hope so.

381
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:51,111
Say, uh, how would you like
to go home for Christmas?

382
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:53,214
I can drop you off on the way and
pick you up on the way back.

383
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:58,571
Oh, gee.

384
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:16,477
Ah, they were working here last
year when I came through.

385
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:20,394
It says, to the right.

386
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:23,105
There it is, over that way!

387
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,746
Blairs Mills.

388
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:52,659
- Blairs Mills... Uh-huh.
- Blairs Mills?

389
00:25:56,145 --> 00:25:58,578
- Blairs Mills... Blairs Mills...
- Bethlehem... Beallsville...

390
00:25:58,602 --> 00:26:00,302
- Blairsville?
- No, that's not it.

391
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:03,248
- All right, C5.
- Blairs Mills, here it is.

392
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:06,841
- It's in Pennsylvania.
- Are we supposed to go through there?

393
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:10,235
Well, it's very close to where
we're supposed to go through.

394
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,685
That's what I was afraid of.
We better bear north a little.

395
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:18,230
- About, uh... half as far as my thumbnail.
- You let me know when we've gone that far.

396
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,337
- Where is north?
- Up this way.

397
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:24,595
- No, no, I mean from where we are.
- That way.

398
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:26,266
Why?

399
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:28,306
Well, we've been going that
way, so naturally, it--

400
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:32,110
- That way.
- Are you sure?

401
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:35,097
No.

402
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,862
Looks a little steep.
What do you think?

403
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,770
That way.

404
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:22,068
- Which way do you wanna try now?
- One looks as bad as the other.

405
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:26,687
Maybe we better just give
the whole thing up, huh?

406
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,948
Look out, there's an elephant!

407
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:40,228
- What the--!?

408
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,290
Why, it's a thrashing machine!
I haven't seen one for years.

409
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:48,264
- We're not getting very far, are we?
- Well, we're holding our own.

410
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,901
Hey, maybe we ought to take a snooze
and then try it again, huh?

411
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,062
Oh yes, I think that
would be a lovely idea.

412
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:11,420
- I could eat the hind leg off a cow.
- And I could eat the horns.

413
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:13,953
Rufus!

414
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:18,715
He's not very bright but he can cook.

415
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:28,550
Now, is this better than jail, or isn't it?

416
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:33,026
I'd almost forgotten I
was going to be in jail.

417
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:36,681
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. The
whole purpose of the trip was to forget it.

418
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:38,603
Thank you.

419
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:54,342
Chicken, coleslaw, dill pickle, ham, Swiss
cheese... Something else I can't identify.

420
00:28:55,305 --> 00:28:58,472
- That's the wax paper.
- Not bad, either.

421
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,048
- I hope my mother will be glad to see me.
- Of course she'll be glad to see you.

422
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:09,626
Yeah, I guess she will, all right.

423
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:38,084
- Ooh!
- What's the matter?

424
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,926
- Oooh, look who's here.
- Oh!

425
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:43,938
Well, good morning, Bossy.

426
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:46,338
Oh, we're surrounded.

427
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,725
Say, how would you like some
nice milk for breakfast?

428
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:53,846
- Would you still know how?
- Would I!

429
00:29:54,468 --> 00:29:58,235
When I took up the law, Indiana lost
its finest milker in seven counties.

430
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,494
- You just watch me.
- What are you gonna put it in?

431
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,037
Well, there...

432
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:06,813
...doesn't seem to
be much choice now.

433
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:09,695
- Um, I can hold it.
- Oh, thanks.

434
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:12,095
Bossy, you stay that way.
I'll get around.

435
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,945
Yeah. That's pretty cute.

436
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:19,573
Um, you stay there, breakfast.

437
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:28,578
Say, what can I use for a stool?
I always used to have a stool.

438
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:32,148
Oh yeah, I'll tell you. You hold this,
and I'll go and sit on the running board.

439
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:35,599
Get her tail around. Come on, Bosbo...
over, Boss... over, Boss...

440
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,793
- Does she like to have her ears tickled?
- Yeah, I think so.

441
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:40,765
- Gimme the bottle.
- Don't you want me to hold it?

442
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:42,755
No, no. I'll hold it between my knees.
That's how I used to do it.

443
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,441
- Come on, get her around a little more.
- I'll try.

444
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:48,514
Come on over, Boss... come on...
come on... over...

445
00:30:53,946 --> 00:30:57,146
- She doesn't seem to wanna go.
- Maybe I can do without sitting.

446
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:01,498
Now come on, Boss. All
we want is about a pint.

447
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,030
- How's it coming?
- Oh, fi--

448
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:06,655
- What did you say?
- She wants to be coaxed.

449
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:08,571
Hold still, Boss.

450
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,347
Oh there, that's fine.

451
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:14,222
Ugh.

452
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:15,444
What did you say?

453
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:20,005
- Are you getting any milk?
- Yeah, it's coming... fine.

454
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,562
Hey, don't let her move.
Push her back.

455
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,003
- I'm pushing as hard as I can.
- No, no, don't. Pull her back that way.

456
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:33,032
- Is that far enough?
- Yes, that's far enough.

457
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:38,055
Oh, you spilled the breakfast.

458
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:44,383
What'd you do that for? Now we'll
have to start all over again.

459
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:45,746
- Well, you pushed her around.
- Well--

460
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:47,418
- Look at your hat!
- What's the matter?

461
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:49,037
Oh...

462
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:52,821
Oh, that's not funny. That's the only
hat I've got that matches this dress.

463
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:54,122
Good morning.

464
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:57,404
What are you doing on my property?

465
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:01,759
Oh, we didn't know this was your property.
See, we got on a detour--

466
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:04,806
It's posted clear enough, ain't it?
Signed every hundred feet.

467
00:32:05,513 --> 00:32:06,513
Can't you read?

468
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,625
Oh, you see, we happen to have got
here in the middle of the night--

469
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:11,561
- Yes, I noticed. You busted down my fence.
- Oh, I'll be glad to pay for it.

470
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,270
You'll pay for it all right.

471
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:17,152
Huh. You New Yorkers think you can
trespass on people's property...

472
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:20,098
...break down their fences, fool
around with their cattle...

473
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,696
...spend the night in their fields
with I don't know what kind of a--

474
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:24,756
Listen, you fresh hick--

475
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:28,308
- Save your language for the judge.
- Who's going to arrest us?

476
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,459
- You're under arrest now.
- Where's your warrant or badge of office?

477
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,917
Don't get cute. I'm a citizen of the
United States, and you're under arrest.

478
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:39,331
And if you think you ain't,
just try to get away.

479
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,742
- Can he do that?
- Unfortunately, he can.

480
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,128
- What'll we do? Walk?
- We'll ride. Open that rumble seat.

481
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:47,277
Open it yourself.

482
00:32:57,514 --> 00:32:59,181
May I have your handkerchief, please?

483
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:01,904
Thank you.

484
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:04,389
- Right here!
- Don't give your right name.

485
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:07,386
- That's a good idea. Don't give yours, either.
- I never do.

486
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:10,105
- Did I get them cakes all right this morning?
- Fine.

487
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:20,304
- Looks like business, Clyde.
- Huh?

488
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,016
Well, I declare! If that
ain't a shotgun wedding...

489
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:27,331
No, that's Hank. He's probably
got a couple of trespassers.

490
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,680
With that new detour, he
gets 'em all the time.

491
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:33,723
Well, it's a pity he couldn't wait
till a body's had his breakfast.

492
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,100
I wanna see the Judge of the Peace.

493
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:39,477
Go on!

494
00:33:40,158 --> 00:33:41,624
Kinda early, ain'tcha?

495
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:47,107
Good morning, Your Honor.

496
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:49,012
There seems to have been a little
misunderstanding here all around.

497
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:51,905
This, um... gentleman here
found my car in his field...

498
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,760
...and, naturally, he came to
the conclusion that--

499
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,308
What's the charge, Hank?

500
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:59,828
Trespassing on posted property, wanton
destruction of a fence, and petty larceny.

501
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:01,176
- No, that's not--
- What'd they steal?

502
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:03,290
They was milkin' one of my
cows when I caught 'em.

503
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:07,507
- Oh, only a little thermos bottle, that big.
- Nobody asked you anything, young woman.

504
00:34:08,323 --> 00:34:10,923
When it comes your turn,
you can talk all you like.

505
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:17,943
- What's your name?
- Mary Smith.

506
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:23,648
Mary... Smith.

507
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,245
- Where do you live?
- Roaring Falls, Ohio.

508
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,820
Roaring... Falls... Ohio.

509
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:33,064
- Occupation?
- Bubble dancer.

510
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:34,369
Huh?

511
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:35,986
Bubble dancer. You know...!?

512
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,163
Whatever that is.

513
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:46,206
Bubble... dancer.

514
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:48,842
All right.

515
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:51,536
- What's your name?
- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

516
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,037
New York, New York.

517
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:01,340
Henry... Wadsworth... Longfellow...
New York.

518
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:04,506
- Occupation?
- Steamfitter.

519
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:10,213
Steam...fitter.

520
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,484
All right. You plead
guilty or not guilty?

521
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:17,798
May it please Your Honor, I'm somewhat
familiar with the legal procedure...

522
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:21,061
- ...having at one time contemplated the law.
- Then you shouldn't have broken the law.

523
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:24,345
- It was an ignorance of the fact, Your Honor.
- Ignorance is no excuse.

524
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,775
I'm aware of that, and I'm also aware
of what a plea of 'not guilty' means...

525
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:28,357
...when made by non-residents of the state.

526
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:29,722
Ain't even married.

527
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,530
I don't know what you
mean by 'even married'.

528
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:35,084
You say 'even married' as though
married was the least people could be.

529
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:36,969
Some minor unimportant arrangement.

530
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,472
I appeal to your sense of chivalry, Your
Honor. I take it you're a married man...

531
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:43,005
...and that the charming lady who
opened the door was your, uh--

532
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,766
Spent the night in my field.
From out of the state.

533
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:50,115
My learned opponent here, I-I
mean that bug with a shotgun...

534
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:52,185
...is trying to inject into
this case an element of--

535
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:54,134
You plead guilty or not guilty?

536
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:56,101
- To what?
- It must be all kind of funny to you--

537
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:59,530
To trespass, destruction of private
property, and petty larceny.

538
00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:02,110
- What'll you settle for?
- What will I settle for?

539
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:05,998
Did you ever hear of contempt of court
while you were studying the law?

540
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:10,246
I think I'll just remand you to the constable
and send you over to the county seat.

541
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:12,423
- Now w-wait a minute, Your--
- Wait, nothin'.

542
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:17,312
I was tryin' to give you a fair trial, but
when men drive girls over the state line...

543
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:20,095
...as you did, the matter's
worth investigatin'.

544
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,746
Also when they give funny names
like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

545
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,773
You may think you're dealin' with rubes,
and I'm gonna give you the opportunity--

546
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:40,941
- Get some water! The house is on fire!
- Water! Water! Water!

547
00:36:41,175 --> 00:36:43,308
It's only a waste bin. Come on!

548
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,937
How the ding-dang that
ever caught on fire?

549
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:52,431
- Now, where'd they go?
- Huh?

550
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,462
Well, I'll be god-darned!

551
00:36:57,427 --> 00:36:58,427
Hey!

552
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,733
Hank, you'll break my window! Don't do it!
Hank, you'll break the windows!

553
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,990
You loon! There's the fire!

554
00:37:27,385 --> 00:37:30,852
Well, that's that. On the way back I suppose
I'll have to duck around through Canada.

555
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:32,496
I guess that would be better.

556
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:36,592
Must feel kinda funny to you
to be a fugitive from justice.

557
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:39,302
Mh-hm. Very funny. You know, all
the way across Pennsylvania...

558
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,416
...I've been trying to figure out how that
fire got started. Nobody was smoking.

559
00:37:44,703 --> 00:37:45,703
I was.

560
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,290
You were?

561
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:51,946
Did you throw anything in that basket?

562
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:53,657
Nothing but a match.

563
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:55,161
Um, a lighted match?

564
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:58,117
Oh, I guess there must've
been some life in it.

565
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,079
Did you throw it in there on purpose?

566
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,710
Well, I wasn't aiming for the spittoon.

567
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:05,932
I suppose you know that's called arson.

568
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:07,028
No!

569
00:38:07,575 --> 00:38:09,808
I thought that was
when you bit somebody!

570
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:12,281
'Bit somebody'...

571
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:15,547
Well, it's better than
going to jail, isn't it?

572
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:18,571
I told you my mind worked differently.

573
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:21,378
Do you realize that house is
probably in flames a mile high?

574
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:22,189
Hope it is.

575
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:24,322
So do I, but what's that got to
do with the morals of the case?

576
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,961
What have morals got to do with it?

577
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:29,408
You treated me like your sister.

578
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:43,222
Here we are.

579
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:46,306
Oh.

580
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:51,099
Hasn't changed much.

581
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:54,941
- A new drugstore.
- Yeah, they creep in overnight.

582
00:38:55,444 --> 00:38:57,077
That's where I went to my first dance.

583
00:38:57,656 --> 00:39:01,389
- I went to my first dance in the firehouse.
- Oh, I've been to the firehouse, too.

584
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:06,827
- Do I keep on going straight ahead?
- No, you turn left at the next corner.

585
00:39:06,993 --> 00:39:08,993
It's about a mile, the
other side of the tracks.

586
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,719
- I'm getting scared.
- Now, now.

587
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,700
Oh, please, let's wait till-- She
might not even live here anymore.

588
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:40,759
Now don't be nervous,
for heaven's sake.

589
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:44,286
- Will you go in with me?
- Sure I'll go in with you. Come on.

590
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,550
- See that tree?
- Mh-hm.

591
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:51,165
I fell out of it when I was twelve.
From that branch right there.

592
00:39:51,404 --> 00:39:55,171
I was a terrible tomboy. If I had been
a man, I would have run away to sea.

593
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:56,547
I landed on my head.

594
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:59,540
Yeah? That's a better gag than hypnotism!
Why didn't your lawyer use that?

595
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:01,902
- I don't know.
- You should've had me for your lawyer.

596
00:40:03,103 --> 00:40:05,836
Well. Here we are.

597
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,155
Come on, now. Smile.

598
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:18,316
Oh, I didn't mean to knock so loud.

599
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,083
That sounds like Mickey.

600
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,853
Don't suppose it is, though.
He'd be almo--

601
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:26,035
- Shut up!
- Somebody's coming.

602
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:30,046
Gee, you've been sweet.

603
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:34,391
Yes?

604
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:42,365
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Doesn't Mrs.
Malone live here anymore?

605
00:40:42,745 --> 00:40:44,712
I guess you mean my wife.

606
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:59,317
Mama! Somebody out
there wants to see ya.

607
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:10,753
Merry Christmas, mama.

608
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:16,992
Come in.

609
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:41,238
- Um, this is Mr.--
- Sargent. How do you do?

610
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:42,342
Sit down.

611
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:48,475
You're looking fine, mama.

612
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:51,264
What'd you come here for?
What do you want?

613
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:56,778
I don't want anything, mama. It was just
Christmas, and Mr. Sargent happened to be--

614
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:59,641
You see, I live just outside of
Wabash, and I knew you'd be glad--

615
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:02,785
- So he brought me with him.
- Glad? Why should I be glad?

616
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:05,764
Good riddance to bad rubbish,
I said the day she left.

617
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:09,161
- Oh, please, mama. Mr. Sargent--
- Just like her father, she is.

618
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:14,028
Always laughin' at serious things, she was.
Never doin' what she was told...

619
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:16,758
...till she winds up stealin'
as I always said she would.

620
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:20,408
Stealin' my mission money that I'd
put by with the sweat of my brow.

621
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,785
I didn't steal it.

622
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:25,530
I've told you a thousand
times I only borrowed it.

623
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:27,930
I was going to pay you
back out of what I'd earn!

624
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:30,584
But you didn't pay me back, did you?
You never paid me back!

625
00:42:30,747 --> 00:42:32,214
And you never paid anybody else back!

626
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:35,427
How could I after you called me a
thief in front of the whole town?

627
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:38,045
Do you think anybody let me
work for them after that?

628
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:42,274
We weren't good enough for you. A decent
home and a hard-working mother...

629
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:43,891
...with a crook for a daughter.

630
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,312
I don't wanna rush you, but
we've still got 50 miles to go.

631
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:48,263
Don't you think we'd
better be on our way?

632
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:52,505
Thanks.

633
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:58,149
Bye, mama.

634
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:01,048
It's been very interesting
meeting you, Mrs.--

635
00:43:01,236 --> 00:43:02,769
The name doesn't concern you.

636
00:43:03,697 --> 00:43:04,897
It certainly does not.

637
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,052
Come on, now. It isn't as bad as that.

638
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:22,121
I'd forgotten how much
that woman hates me.

639
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:24,895
And how much I hate her.

640
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:29,936
That's a terrible thing
to say, isn't it?

641
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:36,800
Ever since I was little, she was always
so right and I was always so wrong.

642
00:43:38,141 --> 00:43:41,274
She was always so good and
I was always so bad. She--

643
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,754
Thank you for getting me out.

644
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:51,529
I'll stay anywhere, only not here!
Not so close to her!

645
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:52,607
Hey...

646
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:58,278
I should have broken my neck
when I fell out of that tree.

647
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:01,932
It's a little late to think
about that now, isn't it?

648
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:04,303
- You won't make me stay in Eltonville?
- No, I won't.

649
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:06,660
- You'll find me a room someplace else?
- I will.

650
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:10,059
Oh, any old dump will do.

651
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:13,812
That's just what you're going to get.

652
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:17,338
It's only got one window, and the
mattress is stuffed with rocks, and...

653
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,119
...there's a painting of the cross-eyedest
old guy you ever saw in your life.

654
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,245
- How do you know?
- How do I know what?

655
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,595
 That my grandfather was cross-eyed?

656
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,230
You mean you're--

657
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,410
You're taking me home with you?

658
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:33,068
Sure, why not?

659
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:36,389
Oh!

660
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:40,727
Hey, now what?

661
00:44:51,975 --> 00:44:54,508
Where you want that fire laid,
Mrs. Sargent?

662
00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:57,762
Land sakes, Willie, there is only
one fireplace on the second floor.

663
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:02,237
- Haven't you made that fire yet?
- No. They had me peelin' potatoes.

664
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,377
Emmy? I think those cookies are burning!

665
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,686
Oh, land sakes!

666
00:45:20,572 --> 00:45:23,006
Lucy Sargent, those
cookies are not burning!

667
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:27,142
I declare it's enough to drive a body crazy
the way you carry on when Jack comes home.

668
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:31,336
I've never burnt anything as is--

669
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,330
Huh, there...

670
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:49,191
Shall I light the fire now, Mrs.
Sargent, or wait till he gets here?

671
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:52,932
- Well, does the room seem chilly, Willie?
- No, it don't seem chilly, Willie...

672
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:56,599
... chilly... to me, but...

673
00:45:56,643 --> 00:46:00,976
...and the way everybody around this place
has been runnin' me ragged all day long...

674
00:46:01,037 --> 00:46:03,870
- ...I doubt if I'd be chilly even in an--
- Ice pond.

675
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,027
Thank you, ma'am.

676
00:46:05,043 --> 00:46:08,376
Now, see here, Willie Simms, if you don't
stop complaining, I declare I'll--

677
00:46:08,424 --> 00:46:10,591
Well, I don't know what I'll do.

678
00:46:10,707 --> 00:46:12,774
Here you are, getting a
lovely home with nothing...

679
00:46:12,797 --> 00:46:15,230
- ...but a few cows and chickens to feed...
- And pigs.

680
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,987
- Oh, what are a few pigs?
- And mules.

681
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:21,721
Well, they don't need any care, and
instead of being grateful--

682
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:25,631
 - And the bull.
- All right, the bull. But even though...

683
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,026
- Rabbits.
- Rabbits.

684
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:30,343
And ducks.

685
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:34,594
- There! There he is.
- And goats.

686
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,507
Emmy! He's here! Willie,
go down and open the door.

687
00:46:42,054 --> 00:46:44,654
And don't forget the fire.
Bring in his bags.

688
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:47,133
Here. Give me the matches, and
I'll light the fire myself.

689
00:46:47,178 --> 00:46:48,845
The matches! The matches!

690
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:52,522
The bags.

691
00:46:53,907 --> 00:46:54,907
- Oh, gosh, oh!
- Hemlock!

692
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,781
- Here he is.
- Emmy, hurry up! Come on!

693
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:18,661
Oh boy, he's got a new car!

694
00:47:19,162 --> 00:47:20,162
He's got a new car!

695
00:47:23,044 --> 00:47:24,044
Jack!

696
00:47:25,162 --> 00:47:26,495
I could hardly wait.

697
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:31,171
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here!
- How are you, mother?

698
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,052
Hello, Aunt Emmy!

699
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,910
I declare I'm glad you're here.

700
00:47:36,928 --> 00:47:39,495
If only to keep your mother from
taking leave of her senses.

701
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:42,191
- For the last week this house has been--
- Oh, gosh!

702
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:44,244
Hiya, Willie. The girls still chasin' ya?

703
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:47,682
Why are you late? We expected you at six.
You didn't have an accident, did you?

704
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:49,074
- Well, no. You see--
- Who's that?

705
00:47:52,147 --> 00:47:53,947
Mother, Aunt Emma, Willie...

706
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:57,397
This is Miss Lee Leander who's
come to spend Christmas with us.

707
00:47:58,854 --> 00:48:01,654
Hello. I hope I won't
be too much trouble.

708
00:48:01,983 --> 00:48:05,683
Trouble? Why, bless you, child,
it's a joy to have you here.

709
00:48:06,135 --> 00:48:08,135
You might have sent a
telegram, John Sargent.

710
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:11,431
Grandpa's room hasn't been cleaned since
your aunt Clara was here for canning!

711
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:15,279
Why, Lucy Sargent, that's not so!
I had Willie in there just last week.

712
00:48:15,402 --> 00:48:17,502
- Oh, gosh!
- It's as clean as a whistle.

713
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,166
Well, I doubt it.
Come along, my dear.

714
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:22,752
You must be freezing and here we are
standing like a couple of old hens.

715
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:26,453
- Did you forget the cookies in the oven?
- Oh, merciful heaven!

716
00:48:29,061 --> 00:48:30,194
Be careful, Emmy!

717
00:48:31,385 --> 00:48:32,385
Come on, dear.

718
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:41,389
- Oh boy.
- What?

719
00:48:42,096 --> 00:48:43,763
Ain't she a peacherino?

720
00:48:45,513 --> 00:48:49,313
- All I can say is... Hot dog!
- Here, take this.

721
00:48:56,849 --> 00:48:59,949
Now, I may be wrong, but my aunt Emma is
probably the second best cook in the world.

722
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,754
Oh, how you talk, Jack.

723
00:49:03,015 --> 00:49:04,415
Who's the first best?

724
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:09,149
There. That room is still far from
clean, Lee, but it's passable.

725
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:12,859
- Well, it was pretty passable before.
- Well, it's perfect now.

726
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,813
Oh, why did she make you do that? Why,
Willie could have done them so easily.

727
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:20,879
- Oh, Willie. Sure, Willie.
- Well, I liked doing them.

728
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:22,408
I've lived in hotels and--

729
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:27,530
Um... places so long I haven't been
around a house as much as I'd like to.

730
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:31,105
- Your folks dead?
- Willie!

731
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:33,896
My father's dead, my
mother's remarried.

732
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:36,825
Oh, I always say that's
so hard on the children.

733
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,977
No matter how nice the new parent
is, it just isn't the same.

734
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,767
I don't think it actually makes
the slightest difference.

735
00:49:44,768 --> 00:49:46,401
- Annie!
- Well, I don't.

736
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:48,276
Well, come on, everybody.

737
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:53,104
Let's all go to the parlor now, and
we'll listen to Jack play the piano.

738
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,430
I took 14 dollars' worth of piano lessons
once, and they've never forgotten it.

739
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:58,394
- I can sing.
- Here you are.

740
00:49:59,384 --> 00:50:01,984
And don't eat it all, we're gonna
string it for the Christmas tree.

741
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:12,381
- Lee, dear, you sit over here.
- Uh-huh.

742
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:14,455
- And, uh, Emmy?
- Hm?

743
00:50:14,564 --> 00:50:16,597
- You sit over here.
- All right.

744
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:17,916
Oh, gimme the matches, Willie.

745
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:20,758
Till you've heard this,
you've heard nothing.

746
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,080
He really plays very well...

747
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,154
...when you consider
the size of his hands.

748
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,284
Bring the popcorn, Willie.

749
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,464
Play "Swanee River", Jack.

750
00:50:35,538 --> 00:50:37,338
- "Swanee River"?
- And sing it.

751
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:47,666
All ready?

752
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:20,089
Cute, too, huh?

753
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:55,405
That's that.

754
00:51:55,934 --> 00:51:58,734
- Oh, play one more piece now, Jack.
- Oh, get out of there.

755
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:01,187
- No, sir. Not till next year.
- Please, do. Just... just one more.

756
00:52:01,728 --> 00:52:02,695
I don't know any more.

757
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:05,802
Oh, yes, you know, the Christmas
carol that I like so much? Now--

758
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:06,805
Ma, we got a guest!

759
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:09,126
Well, she'd like to hear it,
too, wouldn't you, Lee?

760
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:12,331
I can play a piece. I used to
play in the 10-cent store.

761
00:52:12,393 --> 00:52:15,493
- Well, that'd be nice.
- I can sing "The End of a Perfect Day".

762
00:52:15,524 --> 00:52:17,591
- Willie!
- Well, I can.

763
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,293
- Well, so can everybody else.
- Come on, Willie, sing.

764
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:22,850
All right.

765
00:54:04,462 --> 00:54:07,095
Land sakes, child. You
wanna catch pneumonia?

766
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:11,485
There.

767
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:16,072
And I think you better have
a hot water bottle, too.

768
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:20,044
- You look a little peaked.
- Oh, I'm as strong as a horse.

769
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,990
Well, many a horse has
frizz in this weather.

770
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:01,683
- Mother?
- Yes, dear?

771
00:55:02,462 --> 00:55:03,762
I don't know whether I should
tell you this or not...

772
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,439
...but I don't like to bring
somebody under your roof...

773
00:55:05,525 --> 00:55:07,025
...without you knowing
exactly who she is.

774
00:55:07,654 --> 00:55:10,187
- Oh, I think I can guess.
- What?

775
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:13,187
Oh, no, not at all. She isn't
even a friend of mine.

776
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:18,960
Why, I think she's charming. She reminds
me of your father's cousin, Winifred...

777
00:55:19,005 --> 00:55:23,372
...who died when her second was born.
She was a sweet, lovely thing.

778
00:55:24,877 --> 00:55:28,410
- I was just telling your aunt Emmy--
- Yes, she is charming, mother, but...

779
00:55:29,633 --> 00:55:31,166
...unfortunately, she's a crook.

780
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,129
When I get back to New York, I'm
gonna try to put her in jail.

781
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:38,518
But in the meantime, she didn't have
any place to spend Christmas, so--

782
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:40,587
Oh, the poor lamb.

783
00:55:41,418 --> 00:55:43,751
John Sa-- Why, you'll
do no such thing.

784
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:49,687
That girl's as honest as all outdoors. Why,
I can tell by just looking at her face.

785
00:55:50,787 --> 00:55:54,920
If she did take anything, I'm
sure it was entirely by mistake.

786
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:59,994
She's... Well, she's probably a...

787
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:01,696
...hypochondriac.

788
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,200
She might be at that.

789
00:56:07,136 --> 00:56:11,636
She didn't really take anything. You're
just making a bad joke, aren't you?

790
00:56:11,674 --> 00:56:14,074
No, mother. I'm afraid it's
not even her first offense.

791
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:18,430
But that doesn't mean that she
wasn't unhappy, and lonely...

792
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:20,109
...and a human being
like the rest of us.

793
00:56:20,116 --> 00:56:21,383
Oh, the poor thing.

794
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:25,784
She probably didn't get
enough love as a child.

795
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:29,917
Do you remember how ba--
Well, you weren't really bad but...

796
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:33,526
Do you remember when you took my egg-money
I was gonna buy a new dress with?

797
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:37,856
And then how how hard you worked to
pay it back when you did understand?

798
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:40,743
You made me understand.

799
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:45,686
No, dear. It was love
that made you understand.

800
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:53,052
I hope she's going to enjoy
her stay here with us.

801
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,710
We want to make her happy
and comfortable...

802
00:57:00,976 --> 00:57:02,776
Oh, Jack!

803
00:57:04,136 --> 00:57:07,403
Why, I haven't even started that
bottle you gave me last Christmas.

804
00:57:07,452 --> 00:57:11,352
Oh, Hour of Ecstasy! That's the same
kind you gave her last Christmas!

805
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:13,766
It is? They told me
that was the latest.

806
00:57:13,894 --> 00:57:14,894
Oh, I love it.

807
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:18,856
- Oh, isn't that pretty?
- That's the latest, too, Aunt Emmy.

808
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:24,536
Why, Jack Sargent, you oughta
be ashamed of yourself!

809
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,008
Willie? Here's something else.

810
00:57:27,393 --> 00:57:28,393
Whoa! Oh boy.

811
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:31,526
Gee, I love Christmas!

812
00:57:35,156 --> 00:57:35,856
Oh.

813
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,543
That's the latest, Willie.

814
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:40,724
Ah, you got it on backwards.

815
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:43,035
- No, no, Willie, this way.
- That's right.

816
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:44,555
But you got to yodel with it.

817
00:57:50,872 --> 00:57:52,339
I'll practice up on that language.

818
00:57:52,376 --> 00:57:54,843
Oh boy, that's snazzy!
Find a mirror...

819
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:04,188
- Jack from Mother, huh?
- Yes.

820
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:08,519
- Something to wear?
- You wait and see.

821
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:11,162
A sweater, huh?

822
00:58:12,152 --> 00:58:13,119
Did you knit it yourself?

823
00:58:13,678 --> 00:58:15,145
Oh, thanks, mother, that's swell.

824
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,857
- Do you like the color?
- Sure.

825
00:58:16,908 --> 00:58:19,008
- Well, I hope it fits.
- Oh, it'll fit.

826
00:58:21,228 --> 00:58:22,861
- Jack from Aunt Emma.
- Mh-hm.

827
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:27,046
Let's see...

828
00:58:32,998 --> 00:58:34,198
Well, socks, huh?

829
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:36,707
Not so fancy but they
keep your feet warm.

830
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:37,859
Think they'll fit?

831
00:58:39,078 --> 00:58:40,978
- I don't know.
- Thanks, Aunt Emmy.

832
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:43,853
I'm pretty lucky, huh?

833
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:45,827
You bet.

834
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,050
I'm sorry about the
present situation, but--

835
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:53,399
Uh, there's some other packages over there.
See who they're for.

836
00:59:00,363 --> 00:59:01,363
Lee...

837
00:59:03,938 --> 00:59:05,605
Seems you can always
depend on Santa Claus.

838
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:08,120
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, no.

839
00:59:08,154 --> 00:59:10,187
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

840
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:12,322
Come on, open them up right now.

841
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:23,228
Oh.

842
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:25,329
Oh, thank you.

843
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:27,234
It's so pretty.

844
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:28,951
Oh, it's really nothing at all.

845
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:33,859
Just made from some scraps and things
that I've accumulated through the years.

846
00:59:33,886 --> 00:59:34,986
Well, it's lovely.

847
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:37,423
- Oh... Aunt Emma?
- Uh-huh.

848
00:59:48,725 --> 00:59:51,925
Not so fancy, but they're
grand on a cold night...

849
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:53,342
...for a spinster lady.

850
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,573
Oh, that's awfully sweet of you.

851
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:02,069
- Who's that from, Willie?
- No.

852
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:06,791
Oh, why, you dunce. Can't
you remember anything?

853
01:00:12,663 --> 01:00:13,563
Oh.

854
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,637
Oh, Hour of Ecstasy.

855
01:00:19,706 --> 01:00:20,906
Yeah, that's the latest.

856
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:22,455
Mmmmm.

857
01:00:24,161 --> 01:00:25,161
Mmmmm.

858
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:26,822
Oh, thank you.

859
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:33,468
You're all much too kind.

860
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:36,434
I've never met anyone
so thoughtful, so--

861
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,303
Oh, why, my dear,
it's nothing at all.

862
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:42,585
We're so happy to have you here and we're
so anxious for you to enjoy your stay.

863
01:00:43,055 --> 01:00:45,155
There really isn't very
much for you to do...

864
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:47,726
...so you'll just have
to make the best of it.

865
01:00:48,362 --> 01:00:51,662
Tonight, a few friends are coming and
we're gonna bob for apples, and then...

866
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,531
...tomorrow, the young people are gonna
have a treasure hunt in the snow...

867
01:00:55,669 --> 01:00:57,169
... and the next day
we have a taffy pull.

868
01:00:57,315 --> 01:00:58,848
And will that gum up the house.

869
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:01,636
Oh, shush. Won't amount
to a row of pins.

870
01:01:02,082 --> 01:01:04,082
And the day after that, we
have the rummage sale...

871
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:05,698
...and the charity
buffet in the church.

872
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:08,501
A pretty girl like you
oughta be a big help.

873
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:12,654
Why, the men are so tight, we
almost have to pick their pock--

874
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:16,951
Well, I'll--

875
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:18,702
I'll do my best.

876
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:23,792
My specialty is short-changing them.

877
01:01:24,488 --> 01:01:25,188
Emmy!

878
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:27,847
And then we rest up for a day.

879
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,750
And the day after that
is New Year's Eve.

880
01:01:30,945 --> 01:01:33,012
This year, we're gonna have an
old-fashioned barn dance...

881
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:34,653
...like the hicks
we're supposed to be.

882
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,497
And that's all there is. Farmers'
wives don't die of boredom anymore...

883
01:01:37,523 --> 01:01:38,523
...they die of heart failure!

884
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:42,116
Do you suppose they popped?

885
01:01:42,154 --> 01:01:43,821
I'm positive they popped.

886
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:47,773
I wish I could be that sure.

887
01:01:48,153 --> 01:01:51,520
You will be when I've told you the secret,
but you must never let it out of the family.

888
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:53,025
You see, you--

889
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:59,032
- No! Are you sure?
- Yes. Look for yourself.

890
01:02:03,378 --> 01:02:04,378
Oh!

891
01:02:05,573 --> 01:02:06,573
Good morning.

892
01:02:06,866 --> 01:02:08,333
- Good morning.
- How's about some breakfast?

893
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,999
Holy smoke, popovers.

894
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:13,042
- And she made them entirely by herself.
- She did?

895
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:14,643
Well, bring 'em in.

896
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:19,206
What did you tell him that for?

897
01:02:19,404 --> 01:02:22,471
Oh, don't you know the shortcut to a
man's heart is through his gizzard?

898
01:02:22,554 --> 01:02:24,521
Here, take them in while they're hot.

899
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:28,799
There you are.

900
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:32,065
Go on! Hurry up.

901
01:02:37,251 --> 01:02:38,418
Say, I didn't know you could cook.

902
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,940
Oh, I didn't make these,
she just said I did.

903
01:02:41,112 --> 01:02:42,645
Ah. Why'd she say that?

904
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:44,766
Because she's taught
me how, but I--

905
01:02:46,092 --> 01:02:48,392
Well, I guess she thought if
you thought I knew how...

906
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,031
...that would make
everything go faster.

907
01:02:50,276 --> 01:02:51,309
Make what go faster?

908
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:55,254
You see, she thinks you brought me out
here because you're in love with me.

909
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:56,539
Ah.

910
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,097
- Funny, isn't it?
- Yeah.

911
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:06,999
Well, if you think I couldn't make a
popover as good as that, you're nuts!

912
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:18,041
Oh, Judge, would you buy
something at my table?

913
01:03:18,042 --> 01:03:19,142
- I'll be back in just a minute.
- Oh, please.

914
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,897
- Now, now, just a minute, I'll be back.
- Judge, you must buy this beautiful...

915
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:24,341
I'll be back in just a minute.
Just a minute, I'll be back.

916
01:03:25,816 --> 01:03:29,183
- Judge, how about a nice picture frame?
- I'm lookin' for my hat. A silk hat.

917
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:30,678
My wife sent it down here.

918
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:38,674
Richest, tightest man in town.
Come on, Emmy.

919
01:03:42,263 --> 01:03:44,163
- Oh, Judge. Aunt Emma.
- Yes?

920
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,623
Mark down one armadillo
basket, the $7 size.

921
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,687
- Now, just a minute.
- Oh, that's all right.

922
01:03:47,729 --> 01:03:48,862
- I'll tell you what you do.
- My dear miss--

923
01:03:48,911 --> 01:03:51,678
We'll let you have it for $6, and you
can kiss Aunt Emma in the bargain.

924
01:03:51,716 --> 01:03:54,216
Kiss Aunt Emma? Why, why,
why, this is outrageous!

925
01:03:54,226 --> 01:03:55,659
- Four dollars change.
- Why, I-I--

926
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,399
- Oh, you'll love it.
- You'll love it.

927
01:03:57,487 --> 01:03:59,787
- Three dollars change.
- Why, thi-- I protest again--

928
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:03,808
- Why, thi-- This is outrageous!
- Take it easy, Judge. It'll be all right.

929
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,420
- Thank you very much.
- Now, really, Mrs. Sargent.

930
01:04:05,455 --> 01:04:07,555
I think that this joke
has got-- John Sargent!

931
01:04:07,572 --> 01:04:09,605
Nobody's trying to force you to buy anything,
Judge. We just have to keep the odds--

932
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:12,138
John, I protest against it!
Now, John, I protest!

933
01:04:13,377 --> 01:04:16,244
Wearin' pants to a dance! Huh!

934
01:04:16,676 --> 01:04:18,876
You'll never land him that way.

935
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:25,225
Women belong in skirts.

936
01:04:26,236 --> 01:04:27,603
It's the mystery that gets 'em.

937
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:29,811
Oh, I just thought these
would be easier to wear.

938
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:36,481
How big are you
around the waist?

939
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:39,205
Oh, I don't know.
25, 26, I guess.

940
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:43,172
Ha! When I was young,
we thought 19 was big.

941
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,167
Ni--? How could anybody be 19?

942
01:04:46,824 --> 01:04:47,824
Well...

943
01:04:49,254 --> 01:04:53,021
It takes a little pulling,
but it can be done.

944
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:56,031
Now let out your breath.

945
01:04:56,995 --> 01:04:57,995
More. Come on!

946
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,125
Now...

947
01:05:00,432 --> 01:05:01,432
One.

948
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:02,913
Two.

949
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:04,789
Three.

950
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:07,931
Now, how does that feel?

951
01:05:11,812 --> 01:05:14,879
Oh, you'll get used to it.
The rest of us did.

952
01:05:16,468 --> 01:05:17,468
Dingle sticks.

953
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:21,432
Now...

954
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,651
Tie that around your waist.

955
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:35,465
I never did have as much much front as
we were supposed to have in my day.

956
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:39,370
You didn't really wear all
these things, did you?

957
01:05:39,388 --> 01:05:41,455
Of course we did. It's
just the beginning.

958
01:05:41,482 --> 01:05:42,482
Oh.

959
01:05:43,236 --> 01:05:45,169
Now, here's the corset cover.

960
01:05:48,021 --> 01:05:49,421
Ain't passin' that up.

961
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:00,970
Here you go.

962
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:06,691
Oh...

963
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:26,470
Oh, it's beautiful.

964
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:33,984
Oh. Was that...

965
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:36,180
...your wedding dress?

966
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:41,235
I twiddled around with
the idea one summer.

967
01:06:41,982 --> 01:06:43,982
I was all right again by fall.

968
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,640
Thank you, dear.

969
01:06:47,157 --> 01:06:48,957
Lee! Aunt Emma!

970
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:50,422
Coming.

971
01:06:51,229 --> 01:06:52,229
Coming.

972
01:06:52,497 --> 01:06:56,897
Land of the living! The dance is not
gonna run away before we get there.

973
01:06:57,329 --> 01:06:58,329
Well, I just didn't
want Lee to miss the--

974
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:08,827
Gosh.

975
01:08:12,473 --> 01:08:14,940
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes.

976
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,850
They'd have awfully cute babies.

977
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,515
Why, Emmy. Jack isn't in love.
Where'd you get such an idea?

978
01:08:22,614 --> 01:08:24,781
- Fiddlesticks.
- I tell you, they're not.

979
01:08:25,197 --> 01:08:27,030
I'm not gonna tell you why or...

980
01:08:27,218 --> 01:08:30,485
...or anything, but they-- Well,
they just can't be, that's all.

981
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,903
Emmy, you don't know
about these things and--

982
01:08:32,997 --> 01:08:36,364
Mrs. Sargent! If you're referring
to the fact that I never married...

983
01:08:36,397 --> 01:08:38,764
...I'd like to point out that
you don't have to be a horse...

984
01:08:38,851 --> 01:08:39,918
...to judge a horse show.

985
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:43,396
If ever I saw two people
that were in love...

986
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:48,579
Almost over.

987
01:08:49,288 --> 01:08:50,288
Gone quickly, hasn't it?

988
01:08:51,435 --> 01:08:52,435
So quickly.

989
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:58,206
- If that isn't as plain as Pike's Peak.
- Oh, fiddlesticks.

990
01:09:00,465 --> 01:09:02,165
You've all been so sweet.

991
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:04,119
No matter what happens
after we get back...

992
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,073
...it won't matter so much.

993
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:08,683
I'll have some wonderful memories.

994
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:11,199
Ladies and gentlemen!

995
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:15,022
I now have the honor...

996
01:09:16,377 --> 01:09:17,510
...to wish you...

997
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,730
...a Happy New Year!

998
01:10:18,525 --> 01:10:22,725
Good night, children. Sweet dreams.
I'll have your breakfast at 7.15.

999
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,120
What do you want? Flannel
cakes or fried mush?

1000
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,971
Oh, I think we'd ride
better on the mush.

1001
01:10:29,123 --> 01:10:31,756
All right. Happy New Year.

1002
01:10:32,082 --> 01:10:33,315
- Good night, Emmy.
- Night, Lee.

1003
01:10:33,325 --> 01:10:34,325
- Night.
- Good night, Aunt Emmy.

1004
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:35,884
Good night, dear.

1005
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:38,513
- Get a good rest.
- Good night.

1006
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:41,332
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

1007
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:45,418
- Good night, Jack.
- Good night, Lee.

1008
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,696
- Good night, son.
- Good night, mother.

1009
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:55,511
The best of everything
to you this new year.

1010
01:10:55,578 --> 01:10:56,378
Thanks, mother.

1011
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,445
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

1012
01:11:19,153 --> 01:11:21,186
- You sleepy?
- Not very.

1013
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:23,891
You wanna come in my room
and have a cigarette?

1014
01:11:24,752 --> 01:11:25,585
Be nice by the fire.

1015
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:27,135
Well...

1016
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,216
I'll be there in a minute.

1017
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:00,760
Come in.

1018
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:07,752
I'm sorry to disturb you, dear, but I know
how rushed you'll be tomorrow morning.

1019
01:12:07,848 --> 01:12:10,815
- Oh, you're not disturbing me.
- Thank you.

1020
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:17,299
First, I wanted to tell you how glad
we are to have had you here with us.

1021
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,753
And how much I hope you've
enjoyed your stay with us.

1022
01:12:20,851 --> 01:12:22,651
You'll never know how much.

1023
01:12:23,565 --> 01:12:28,865
And then I want to tell you how sorry
I am that you're in trouble...

1024
01:12:29,668 --> 01:12:32,868
...and how much I hope everything
will come out all right.

1025
01:12:37,362 --> 01:12:39,329
I didn't know you
knew about that.

1026
01:12:44,831 --> 01:12:46,231
You poor child.

1027
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:51,778
I never would have mentioned
it to you now, only--

1028
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:54,516
Well...

1029
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:59,197
Did Jack ever tell you
anything about his childhood?

1030
01:13:02,037 --> 01:13:03,037
No, why?

1031
01:13:04,997 --> 01:13:09,230
We were very poor after my husband died.
In fact, we had nothing.

1032
01:13:10,638 --> 01:13:14,571
Jack had to do chores before school
and chores after school and...

1033
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:19,307
...and when he was in high school, he
drove a delivery truck afternoons...

1034
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:21,095
...to earn a little money.

1035
01:13:21,783 --> 01:13:25,616
Then, after chores, he studied
evenings to try to get into college.

1036
01:13:26,341 --> 01:13:30,641
He worked his way through college, and
he worked his way through law school.

1037
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:35,574
Oh, I'm not trying to say that
there's anything unusual in that.

1038
01:13:36,482 --> 01:13:39,382
Thousands of boys are doing
the same thing this minute.

1039
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:45,128
But I am trying to tell you how hard
he worked to get where he is today.

1040
01:13:46,038 --> 01:13:48,371
How very, very hard.

1041
01:13:50,313 --> 01:13:54,980
And I don't think that we should allow
anything to spoil it for him now.

1042
01:14:05,035 --> 01:14:07,602
I don't think why anything
should spoil it for him. Do you?

1043
01:14:08,302 --> 01:14:09,669
He's in love with you.

1044
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:11,750
Oh, he isn't in love with me.

1045
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,635
He's never had any more
interest in me than some...

1046
01:14:16,294 --> 01:14:18,561
...some panhandler
you buy a meal for.

1047
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:21,092
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

1048
01:14:27,949 --> 01:14:29,682
But he kissed you tonight.

1049
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,160
Well, I--

1050
01:14:34,247 --> 01:14:35,647
I'm not exactly ugly.

1051
01:14:37,617 --> 01:14:40,317
Oh, he... he may have a
little fever for me, but...

1052
01:14:41,235 --> 01:14:43,002
...it isn't going
any further and...

1053
01:14:43,876 --> 01:14:45,609
...it hasn't been anyplace, either.

1054
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:48,490
He's no fool.

1055
01:14:49,849 --> 01:14:51,449
And even if he was, I--

1056
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:55,284
I wouldn't hurt him, or you...

1057
01:14:56,739 --> 01:14:57,939
...Aunt Emmy, or..

1058
01:14:59,715 --> 01:15:00,715
...even Willie.

1059
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:17,209
Thank you, dear.

1060
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:29,866
You do love him, though.
Don't you?

1061
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:35,189
I'm afraid so.

1062
01:15:53,212 --> 01:15:55,712
Here's some of the cookies you made.
Don't forget how you made 'em.

1063
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:57,252
Goodbye, mummy.

1064
01:15:57,534 --> 01:15:59,734
- Goodbye, Aunt Emmy.
- Goodbye.

1065
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,440
- Goodbye, Emmy.
- Goodbye, Willie.

1066
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,990
- Goodbye, Willie.
- Oh, goodbye.

1067
01:16:04,052 --> 01:16:05,052
Goodbye and...

1068
01:16:05,571 --> 01:16:06,871
...thank you for everything.

1069
01:16:07,587 --> 01:16:08,587
I'll never forget it.

1070
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:12,267
Oh, you're quite welcome, dear,
and come back whenever you can.

1071
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:17,112
Now wrap up and
keep good and warm.

1072
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:21,972
Drive carefully, son. Are you going
by way of Scranton or Pittsburgh?

1073
01:16:22,045 --> 01:16:23,545
- Through Canada!
- Oh!

1074
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,046
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

1075
01:16:25,704 --> 01:16:27,804
Hey! Don't forget to write!

1076
01:16:32,994 --> 01:16:36,027
Don't you forget to chop some wood.
Now, Christmas is over.

1077
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,759
Ain't it the truth...

1078
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:53,756
- Have you anything to declare?
- No.

1079
01:16:53,959 --> 01:16:56,459
Oh, I got four Chinese and a barrel of
Cooley on the rumble seat, but that's all.

1080
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:00,830
- Where are you from?
- United States.

1081
01:17:00,838 --> 01:17:02,171
- Where were you born?
- Indiana.

1082
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,913
- Where are you from?
- The United States.

1083
01:17:03,925 --> 01:17:05,292
- Where were you born?
- Indiana.

1084
01:17:05,317 --> 01:17:07,217
And what is your reason
for going through Canada?

1085
01:17:07,311 --> 01:17:08,478
I'm a fugitive from justice.

1086
01:17:08,589 --> 01:17:10,622
You sound like a fugitive
from a nuthouse.

1087
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:12,856
- Go ahead, sir. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1088
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,920
- You know something?
- What?

1089
01:17:21,782 --> 01:17:22,782
You're in Canada now.

1090
01:17:23,461 --> 01:17:24,261
What about it?

1091
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:26,829
If you didn't wanna go back
tomorrow, I couldn't make ya.

1092
01:17:31,331 --> 01:17:32,131
Did you hear what I said?

1093
01:17:33,557 --> 01:17:34,457
I heard you.

1094
01:17:39,265 --> 01:17:40,898
Why didn't you come in for
that cigarette last night?

1095
01:17:42,504 --> 01:17:44,471
Oh, I... didn't feel like smoking.

1096
01:17:54,427 --> 01:17:56,994
I hope you don't bust out laughin'
when you look at me in court.

1097
01:17:57,982 --> 01:17:59,315
I won't feel much like laughing.

1098
01:18:02,035 --> 01:18:03,935
You know, it's funny that of all
the people in the courtroom...

1099
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,931
...you were the only one that
seemed to have a heart.

1100
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,414
- You'd think you'd be the last one.
- Don't give me any credit.

1101
01:18:10,587 --> 01:18:13,587
Played a fairly dirty trick on you and I
felt a little bad about it, that's all.

1102
01:18:14,638 --> 01:18:16,005
How did you play
me a dirty trick?

1103
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:17,826
By having your case put over
till after the holidays...

1104
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:20,556
...when I saw the jury was gonna
acquit you for Christmas.

1105
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,380
Why, you dog!

1106
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,241
Huh!

1107
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:28,150
- That was pretty smart of you, all right.
- Part of the business.

1108
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:32,361
Then when that fat slob got me out, it was
because your conscience was bothering you?

1109
01:18:33,283 --> 01:18:34,083
A little.

1110
01:18:35,622 --> 01:18:37,622
And all the time I
thought it was my legs.

1111
01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:39,809
I didn't even know
you were against me.

1112
01:18:40,139 --> 01:18:42,906
Oh, I-I knew you were supposed to be
tryin' to put me in jail or something...

1113
01:18:42,946 --> 01:18:46,713
...but I don't know, you...
you seemed so gentle.

1114
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,389
That's part of the technique.

1115
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:50,791
If you don't treat a
woman with kid gloves...

1116
01:18:50,844 --> 01:18:52,777
...every man on the jury wants
to punch you in the nose.

1117
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:55,699
You have to handle them with kid gloves,
too, or you'll get it right in the verdict.

1118
01:18:56,823 --> 01:18:59,256
It's very hard to put a woman in
jail, no matter what she's done.

1119
01:19:00,234 --> 01:19:02,034
I'm supposed to be sort
of a specialist at it.

1120
01:19:02,176 --> 01:19:03,543
- No, you're not.
- Sure I am.

1121
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,123
You're just trying to
make me hate you...

1122
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:07,605
...so you won't feel so bad when you
give me the business, aren't you?

1123
01:19:09,155 --> 01:19:10,288
You are, aren't you?

1124
01:19:14,278 --> 01:19:14,845
I mean it.

1125
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:17,080
- I wish you'd stop talking nonsense.
- It isn't nonsense.

1126
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:19,579
I'm not a policeman. It's none of my
business whether you go back or not.

1127
01:19:19,786 --> 01:19:22,386
- Anyway, I haven't any money.
- You wouldn't have to worry about that.

1128
01:19:22,462 --> 01:19:23,062
Haw-haw!

1129
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:26,838
I can just see the fizz on your fat friend
if he had to shell out that five grand.

1130
01:19:26,861 --> 01:19:29,628
- You don't have to worry about that, either.
- I can worry about it if I want to.

1131
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:32,563
A fine district attorney you are!

1132
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:36,197
You know I love you, don't you?

1133
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:40,472
- Don't say that.
- Why shouldn't I say it?

1134
01:19:41,303 --> 01:19:43,670
Because some chiseling jeweler claims
you swiped one of his bracelets?

1135
01:19:44,477 --> 01:19:45,377
I did swipe it.

1136
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,007
The jury will tell you
whether you took it or not.

1137
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:48,757
He got it back, didn't he?

1138
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:52,590
Anyway, what you did yesterday and what
you do today are two different things.

1139
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,920
All the State wants you to do is
lay off other people's property.

1140
01:19:56,367 --> 01:19:58,234
Doesn't care how that
condition is arrived at.

1141
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:03,908
Once you were with me, you
wouldn't pull any of that stuff.

1142
01:20:04,361 --> 01:20:06,694
- I might.
- I'd get your ears knocked down.

1143
01:20:08,342 --> 01:20:09,342
Please!

1144
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:11,406
You love me, don't you, Lee?

1145
01:20:13,299 --> 01:20:14,299
No.

1146
01:20:15,676 --> 01:20:17,576
I suppose that's why you've looked
at me the way you have, huh?

1147
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:19,808
Danced with me the way you did
and kissed me the way you did.

1148
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:23,390
Why your hand has always found mine
and mine has always found yours...

1149
01:20:23,488 --> 01:20:25,088
...whenever they were
anywhere near each other.

1150
01:20:30,017 --> 01:20:31,484
Oh, don't be a sucker.

1151
01:20:33,352 --> 01:20:37,052
Naturally, you're a good-looking
man and I'm only human, but...

1152
01:20:37,496 --> 01:20:40,796
...everything you said about the State
not caring or my staying here...

1153
01:20:40,842 --> 01:20:43,142
...or how I'd be when we
were together is the bunk.

1154
01:20:43,733 --> 01:20:46,133
You've gotta remember how hard you
worked to get where you are...

1155
01:20:46,212 --> 01:20:48,645
...and how you drove a truck after
school and did the chores and--

1156
01:20:48,723 --> 01:20:50,323
My mother has been talking
to you, hasn't she?

1157
01:20:50,587 --> 01:20:53,154
Why shouldn't she? She's got
something to be proud of.

1158
01:20:53,644 --> 01:20:55,711
And you've gotta be proud
and think about it, too...

1159
01:20:55,737 --> 01:20:58,137
...instead of telling
people to jump bail and--

1160
01:21:02,304 --> 01:21:03,837
You know perfectly
well that we're--

1161
01:21:09,192 --> 01:21:10,225
Don't be unfair.

1162
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:12,528
I love you, Lee.

1163
01:21:18,155 --> 01:21:19,822
It'll be awfully
hard to lose you.

1164
01:21:21,271 --> 01:21:23,171
- You know what I wish?
- No.

1165
01:21:23,816 --> 01:21:26,049
I wish the case was over
and you'd been acquitted.

1166
01:21:27,474 --> 01:21:29,774
- Then you shouldn't have had it postponed.
- That's true.

1167
01:21:31,322 --> 01:21:32,689
If I hadn't, I
wouldn't have met you.

1168
01:21:33,986 --> 01:21:34,986
That's true.

1169
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,100
So the case is over and
you've been acquitted.

1170
01:21:39,214 --> 01:21:40,114
Knock wood.

1171
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:42,268
- And I pull out a marriage license...
- Oh, gee.

1172
01:21:42,476 --> 01:21:45,243
...and we march right into the judge's
chambers and have him marry us.

1173
01:21:46,309 --> 01:21:48,242
You know you're talking like
a four-year-old, don't you?

1174
01:21:49,234 --> 01:21:50,434
You know where we're
going for our honeymoon?

1175
01:21:50,884 --> 01:21:52,217
- Where?
- Niagara Falls.

1176
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,714
But we're there now, darling.

1177
01:22:27,863 --> 01:22:30,263
- You're crazy, Jack.
- Well, I thought it was all settled.

1178
01:22:30,307 --> 01:22:32,007
That was in Niagara Falls.

1179
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,983
People aren't responsible for
what they say in Niagara Falls.

1180
01:22:35,486 --> 01:22:37,519
This is New York.
This is today and...

1181
01:22:39,256 --> 01:22:40,556
...this is different.

1182
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,733
As my aunt Emmy would
say: 'Fiddlesticks'.

1183
01:22:42,769 --> 01:22:43,869
Well, it isn't fiddlesticks.

1184
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,627
In the first place, there's no reason
why they should acquit me and...

1185
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:49,864
...even if they did, I
wouldn't marry you.

1186
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,010
Don't you love me anymore?

1187
01:22:53,104 --> 01:22:54,437
I never loved you.

1188
01:22:54,922 --> 01:22:56,755
- Were you just toying with me?
- Oh, shut up.

1189
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:59,699
You'll have to develop more courtesy
and respect for your future husband...

1190
01:22:59,983 --> 01:23:01,583
...or I'll actually have to
resort to strong measures.

1191
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,127
'A woman, a dog, a hickory tree,
The better you beat 'em, the better they be.'

1192
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:05,309
Oh, quit it, will ya?

1193
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:08,318
All right. What?

1194
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,828
You know it isn't right, Jack.

1195
01:23:12,032 --> 01:23:15,965
Can't you see the papers? 'District
Attorney Marries Girl Crook'.

1196
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:18,483
I'd only hurt you.

1197
01:23:18,732 --> 01:23:21,365
Don't you remember how the judge
acted when he saw us in that place?

1198
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,827
Well, but you won't be a
crook, you'll be acquitted.

1199
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:26,003
- How do you know?
- Well, I don't know, but...

1200
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:28,166
... I think we've got a good chance.

1201
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:32,285
You wouldn't do anything to
make them acquit me, would you?

1202
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:33,674
What could I do?

1203
01:23:34,222 --> 01:23:35,722
That would be a fine thing!

1204
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:41,727
Driver, stop on the next
corner, will ya, a minute?

1205
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:45,098
We'd better not get out together.
That'd be pushing things too far.

1206
01:23:48,781 --> 01:23:50,448
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks.

1207
01:23:50,841 --> 01:23:53,508
- Don't be unhappy.
- I'm not unhappy, I'm...

1208
01:23:54,427 --> 01:23:55,527
...all confused.

1209
01:23:56,446 --> 01:23:57,779
Everything's gonna
come out all right.

1210
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,200
It's gotta come out all right.

1211
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:10,751
Let me out in the middle
of the block, will you?

1212
01:24:18,469 --> 01:24:19,869
I tell you, I did see them.

1213
01:24:20,254 --> 01:24:24,587
Dancing in a café, two hours after he
was prosecuting her in this very court.

1214
01:24:24,649 --> 01:24:27,082
And I tell you, you're mistaken.
That boy's dead on the level.

1215
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,863
And if he weren't quite as honest as he is,
I'd say he had a big future in politics.

1216
01:24:30,921 --> 01:24:33,821
- Why, I stood as close to them as--
- You forget that you're an old man.

1217
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:35,968
Your eyes aren't as good
as they used to be.

1218
01:24:35,992 --> 01:24:38,059
As it happens, I spoke to
him and he answered me.

1219
01:24:38,191 --> 01:24:40,158
Well, anybody would answer you.
That's only common politeness.

1220
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,333
- I called him Jack.
- There are millions of people called Jack.

1221
01:24:43,366 --> 01:24:46,266
You haven't got a leg to stand on. You're
trying to make a case against this boy!

1222
01:24:49,704 --> 01:24:50,671
All ready, Your Honor.

1223
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:51,892
Be right in.

1224
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:54,774
So now I suppose you think
he's gonna throw the case?

1225
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:57,261
Those are your words,
Henry, not mine.

1226
01:24:57,315 --> 01:24:59,815
I tell you, he wouldn't throw a case
if he were trying his own brother!

1227
01:25:00,335 --> 01:25:01,935
Not if you were in
court, he wouldn't.

1228
01:25:02,246 --> 01:25:04,846
- All right, then, I'll listen from here.
- That's all I wanted.

1229
01:25:05,226 --> 01:25:08,259
- That and your apology later.
- You'll get that in a pig's eye.

1230
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:12,139
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!

1231
01:25:12,496 --> 01:25:15,629
The Court of General Sessions, Division of
the Supreme Court of New York County...

1232
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,940
...is now in session. His
Honor, Judge Walker, presiding.

1233
01:25:21,433 --> 01:25:25,433
You heard Dr. Keinmetz describe
the condition known as...

1234
01:25:25,816 --> 01:25:28,883
- ...hypnoleptic catalepsy?
- Yes, sir.

1235
01:25:29,261 --> 01:25:31,561
Would you say that is the
condition you were in?

1236
01:25:32,887 --> 01:25:34,187
I guess so. Yes, sir.

1237
01:25:36,217 --> 01:25:37,217
That's all.

1238
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:41,116
Just a moment, please,
Ms. Leander.

1239
01:25:44,508 --> 01:25:45,308
Now...

1240
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:49,442
You said you were hypnotized when you left
the jewelry store and walked up 5th Avenue.

1241
01:25:50,861 --> 01:25:51,561
Didn't you?

1242
01:25:52,401 --> 01:25:54,201
- Well...
- Did you, or didn't you?

1243
01:25:55,075 --> 01:25:57,775
- Well, my lawyer said so.
- Your lawyer said so?

1244
01:25:58,345 --> 01:25:59,878
Are we to understand then
that you and your...

1245
01:25:59,932 --> 01:26:01,932
...lawyer do not agree
exactly as to what happened?

1246
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:03,419
Don't answer that question!

1247
01:26:04,945 --> 01:26:06,045
I object, Your Honor.

1248
01:26:06,115 --> 01:26:09,115
The question is highly improper,
irrelevant, immaterial...

1249
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,975
...and I ask it be
stricken from the record.

1250
01:26:11,096 --> 01:26:13,896
Sustained. The jury will
disregard the question.

1251
01:26:15,287 --> 01:26:16,787
Were you hypnotized,
or weren't you?

1252
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:19,334
- Well, I suppose--
- We don't want your suppositions.

1253
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,167
We want to know whether you
were hypnotized or not.

1254
01:26:22,643 --> 01:26:23,876
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

1255
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:27,138
- I guess I was hypnotized.
- You guess you were hypnotized?

1256
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:30,048
First you suppose you were hypnotized
and now you guess you were.

1257
01:26:30,537 --> 01:26:33,637
Kindly remember you're under oath, Ms.
Leander. Do you know the penalty for perjury?

1258
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:35,776
- I object, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

1259
01:26:35,851 --> 01:26:36,851
Not so rough, Jack.

1260
01:26:36,904 --> 01:26:39,071
How many times have I told you,
when you're working with a woman--

1261
01:26:39,492 --> 01:26:41,292
Well, what's it? A guess
or a supposition?

1262
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:44,846
- What's he getting so tough about?
- He's just naturally mean.

1263
01:26:45,094 --> 01:26:47,761
I sat on a murder case, and
they didn't get that rough.

1264
01:26:50,324 --> 01:26:52,591
Your Honor, these jurors
are gabbing again.

1265
01:26:54,632 --> 01:26:57,899
The jurors will cease whispering and give
their entire attention to the case at hand.

1266
01:26:58,239 --> 01:26:59,606
- Proceed.
- Ms. Leander...

1267
01:27:00,772 --> 01:27:04,072
Will you kindly tell us how
it feels to be... hypnotized?

1268
01:27:04,128 --> 01:27:05,795
- I object!
- Sustained.

1269
01:27:08,554 --> 01:27:10,454
How old were you when you
began to steal things?

1270
01:27:10,537 --> 01:27:12,004
- I object!
- Sustained.

1271
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:15,925
- What's that got to do with this?
- Just trying to get her in wrong.

1272
01:27:16,132 --> 01:27:17,865
Your Honor, those
jurors are at it again.

1273
01:27:20,581 --> 01:27:23,881
Mr. Sargent. I am perfectly capable
of running this courtroom...

1274
01:27:23,886 --> 01:27:25,086
...without prompting from counsel.

1275
01:27:26,899 --> 01:27:30,966
If there's any more whispering among the
jurors, I'll hold the offenders in contempt.

1276
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:35,131
Now proceed with this case.

1277
01:27:37,074 --> 01:27:40,541
How many times have you been
hypnotized by beautiful jewelry?

1278
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:42,214
- I object!
- I guess quite a lot of times.

1279
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:45,217
Please don't answer questions
after I've objected to them.

1280
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:49,118
Objection sustained. The jury will
disregard the question and the answer.

1281
01:27:49,337 --> 01:27:51,437
Did you hear Dr. Keinmetz'
opinion about hypnotism?

1282
01:27:53,655 --> 01:27:56,455
Will you kindly answer my question and
not keep us waiting here all day?

1283
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:00,858
Will you answer my question?

1284
01:28:06,568 --> 01:28:09,268
Your Honor, if the witness refuses
to answer my questions...

1285
01:28:09,322 --> 01:28:10,422
...there's nothing
more I can do.

1286
01:28:11,347 --> 01:28:13,447
Prisoner will please
answer counsel's question?

1287
01:28:13,515 --> 01:28:16,048
- May I lend you my handkerchief?
- Your Honor--

1288
01:28:16,115 --> 01:28:17,815
And kindly address your
answers to me over here.

1289
01:28:17,849 --> 01:28:18,949
- Your Honor, I won't plead--
- Your Honor...

1290
01:28:19,005 --> 01:28:21,105
...I don't believe this young lady is well.
I think a five-minute recess would be...

1291
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:22,683
- But I want to be guilty!
-...sufficient for her recovery.

1292
01:28:22,722 --> 01:28:24,922
- I'm undoubtedly responsible for having--
- Please, Jack.

1293
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:25,977
Your Honor!

1294
01:28:31,337 --> 01:28:32,870
I just wanna plead guilty!

1295
01:28:33,328 --> 01:28:35,761
If Your Honor would kindly
grant a five-minute recess...

1296
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:39,783
My child, why do you
want to plead guilty?

1297
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:42,531
Because I am guilty.

1298
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:46,325
And when you make a mistake,
you've got to pay for it.

1299
01:28:47,267 --> 01:28:48,700
Otherwise you never learn.

1300
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:52,229
Your Honor, it must be apparent
this is not normal conduct.

1301
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:54,407
Quite apparent, and the State has
no wish to take advantage...

1302
01:28:54,449 --> 01:28:57,449
-...of a temporary aberration, a stupid--
- There's nothing temporary about this.

1303
01:28:57,607 --> 01:29:00,041
You can see that I'm in
my right mind, can you?

1304
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:05,543
Well, in that case, there's
nothing more to be said.

1305
01:29:07,922 --> 01:29:09,689
The Court at this time will...

1306
01:29:10,169 --> 01:29:14,969
...set next Friday, January 6th, 10 a.m.
as time for passing sentence.

1307
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,863
Prisoner is remanded to the city jail.

1308
01:29:22,738 --> 01:29:24,205
Thank you, Your Honor.

1309
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:48,791
Jury is dismissed.

1310
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:00,733
Well?

1311
01:30:02,232 --> 01:30:03,232
I don't know.

1312
01:30:20,523 --> 01:30:21,523
Wait up!

1313
01:30:26,377 --> 01:30:27,310
Do you know what you've done?

1314
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,174
Do you realize it can't be undone?

1315
01:30:31,222 --> 01:30:34,622
You understand there's no appeal? No
retrial, no mistrial? Nothing but jail?

1316
01:30:35,837 --> 01:30:37,904
- How long will I get?
- How do I know?

1317
01:30:40,133 --> 01:30:40,966
Maybe you won't get very long...

1318
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,140
...but if you'd kept your trap shut,
you wouldn't have to go at all.

1319
01:30:44,006 --> 01:30:45,506
There wasn't anything else to do.

1320
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:47,479
Don't you see?

1321
01:30:48,511 --> 01:30:51,044
You're so strong, and you
argue so well, and I--

1322
01:30:52,436 --> 01:30:53,403
I love you so much.

1323
01:30:53,702 --> 01:30:55,035
You certainly proved that.

1324
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:58,067
I'd always do what you wanted,
even if it wasn't good for you.

1325
01:30:58,931 --> 01:31:03,731
I'd never have a chance against you,
and you'd never have a chance with me.

1326
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:07,823
Like... like just now when you
were trying to lose the case.

1327
01:31:10,036 --> 01:31:12,003
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Oh, hogwash.

1328
01:31:12,937 --> 01:31:14,170
Oh, I know what you
were trying to do.

1329
01:31:14,423 --> 01:31:16,723
Save little Willie's career
from the bad, bad woman.

1330
01:31:18,744 --> 01:31:21,144
You poor sap! Don't you think I'm the
best judge of what's good for me...

1331
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,149
...and what I want most in this world?

1332
01:31:24,411 --> 01:31:25,111
No.

1333
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:26,501
And when you were making
your grand gesture...

1334
01:31:26,569 --> 01:31:28,169
...did you stop to think how
much you were hurting me?

1335
01:31:29,059 --> 01:31:31,059
Do you think I'm gonna stop
loving you just because they...

1336
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:33,451
...lock you up with a bunch of hikers
and hopheads for a few years?

1337
01:31:34,523 --> 01:31:36,790
- I'm not much better.
- You're good enough for me.

1338
01:31:43,377 --> 01:31:44,377
Will you...

1339
01:31:45,581 --> 01:31:47,281
...come and see me sometime?

1340
01:31:47,354 --> 01:31:48,087
Come and see you?

1341
01:31:49,187 --> 01:31:51,287
I'm going to send for the judge
and marry you right now.

1342
01:31:53,955 --> 01:31:54,955
Oh...

1343
01:31:59,219 --> 01:31:59,919
But...

1344
01:32:01,592 --> 01:32:03,092
...thank you just the same.

1345
01:32:05,701 --> 01:32:07,501
If you still wanted
me afterwards...

1346
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:10,681
...I'd be all square.

1347
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:14,703
And you would've had plenty
of time to think things over.

1348
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:17,690
Lots of things.

1349
01:32:25,549 --> 01:32:26,549
Will you--

1350
01:32:29,022 --> 01:32:30,822
Will you stand beside me and...

1351
01:32:31,941 --> 01:32:33,941
...hold my hand when
they sentence me?

1352
01:32:34,777 --> 01:32:35,910
Of course I will.

1353
01:32:42,135 --> 01:32:43,335
I won't be afraid.

1354
01:32:47,231 --> 01:32:48,231
I love you so.

1355
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:03,435
