1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:01,779
I love women.

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:03,763
But, like a lot.

3
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:07,983
So much, I actually get kinda emotional
when I talk about this. I'm Sorry.

4
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,604
I think it's because I have so much
respect for women.

5
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:16,338
I mean if women are reigning the world,
how much better off would we be?

6
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:19,982
I'm kinda like the biggest feminist there is..

7
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:22,804
anyway when I'm holding a woman and
I got one hand behind the back of her neck..

8
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:25,554
and two fingers up inside her
and I'm  just tweaking that G-spot ..

9
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,346
and I'm playing like a Stradivarius

10
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:29,455
and I watch her writhe in ectasy

11
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,697
I mean that's like a religious experience

12
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:33,355
and I'm not gonna lie to ya.
I don't think ...

13
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:37,237
Picasso or Da Vinci has done anything more
inspired than I do when I'm with a woman.

14
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:39,722
In my own small way, I've made a contribution ...

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,652
I've made the world.. just..

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,597
a little bit better.

17
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:46,828
I guess ...

18
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:48,912
I exist ...

19
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:50,419
to please women.

20
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:52,595
That's it.

21
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,219
Thank you, Rachel.

22
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,426
That was impressive.

23
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:02,056
Very.

24
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:05,065
It almost sound like you believe what you're saying.

25
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:06,797
Almost, ja.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,809
Okay. You know what,
I'm about to feel insulted here..

27
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:10,475
Not only I believe what I'm saying..

28
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,920
but what you just heard, that's my credo.

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,146
Pleasing woman, is your credo?

30
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,241
It is. It's my credo! Tell 'em , Andy.

31
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,824
Yes, yes, that is.. that is..
is his credo.

32
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:26,671
He's told me many times,
that it's his credo.

33
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:29,004
What is your credo, Andy?

34
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:31,919
Uhh, ya know, I don't know if I can really sum up ...

35
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:35,562
my whole value system
in a couple of sentences. It's quite complex.

36
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:37,289
Give it a shot, buddy. Okay?

37
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:39,780
Okay. I umm.. Well, I umm...

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,894
I believe in err.. I believe in justice..

39
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:46,951
and uh.. I think that everyone has the right to aa..

40
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,640
- To assemble.
- We have to go to the bathroom ...

41
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,149
And make a little.. pee-pee.

42
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,773
Eva.

43
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:57,868
Okay. Don't be long~ We'll miss you~

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,869
What the fuck are you talking about?

45
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:03,690
- What the fuck am I? What the fuck are you talking about?
- Me?

46
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,920
I don't remember what that was.
I stopped listening. I zoned out.

47
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,475
I'm looking at you. You're saying words that dont make sense..

48
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:11,239
Andy, do me a favor. Just pay attention, okay?

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,227
We're this close to "Pussy Town".

50
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,745
This close. We're sitting at the gas station
right outside the "Pussy Town"..

51
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:19,397
with an orange crush and a slim jim and
we're gonna cruise on in to "Pussy Town".

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,961
Please stop saying "Pussy Town".

53
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,333
Listen, I am rusty. Alright.

54
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:24,864
I don't know what you expect. I am rusty.

55
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:27,076
But they are stewardess.

56
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:28,458
From Lufthansa!

57
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,895
GROUP SEX

58
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:52,288
No, goddammit. I mean what the fu-

59
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:53,254
I mean look ...

60
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,023
God! Look at you!
Look at you.

61
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,462
You are sexy and you're gorgeus and you're...

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,658
Guys, I'm insane that I'm not into this right now. You know?
I mean..

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,181
- What are we doing here?
- We're enjoying it, Andy.

64
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:06,716
We're having fun.

65
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:10,084
No! It's not fun for me. No, it's not!

66
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,251
You know, it's not fun for me unless.. unless..

67
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,530
I feel something. And I don't.

68
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,539
I don't feel anything.

69
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,685
You know, I don't care about you, at all.

70
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:22,021
Urgh, I'm sorry.

71
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,422
Fine.

72
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:26,590
Just.. eat me out?

73
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,304
Morning sunshine!

74
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:44,191
If these are'nt the fluffiest, the most delicious
pancakes on the planet.

75
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,966
I had to batter the eggs and the milk. And I thought

76
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,008
You know what, how do I wake these up?

77
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:51,608
Baking powder. A'ight.

78
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:54,080
But I want that butter milk flavor. The butter's the key.

79
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:56,087
Ya. Please, please. Tell me it's not you.

80
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:59,830
Oh, I got this maple syrup from this guy in Vermont, off eBay.

81
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:01,759
The farmer only makes
40 bottles a year ...

82
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:03,100
it's like a freaking Lorenzo's oil.

83
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,989
Is that Inge from last night?

84
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:08,118
Oh yea yea yea,
I recorded em on my site. Stored 'em on my 80 gig.

85
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,112
Mine did'nt work out. I sent her home.

86
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,379
Yea you did. Home to papa.

87
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,220
700 Dinki Doughnuts franchise around the country.

88
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:28,504
You don't mention that?

89
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:32,948
You give me robots tossing giant
doughnuts on a skyscraper..

90
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:35,093
doughnuts spaceships.. shooting..

91
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:37,718
lasers at robots.

92
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:39,195
- Doughnuts and robots.
- Robots and Donuts.

93
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:40,699
- Robots and Donuts.
- Doughnuts and robots.

94
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:43,351
Who do these little cartoons?

95
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:46,451
Oh, it's a.. it's Andy. He's got an eye.

96
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:48,279
That's it?

97
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,194
I keep hearing what an amazing,
creative team you are..

98
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,331
- I dont see it.
- Oh, Come on now Alan ...

99
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:54,842
these are my.. these are my "A-Team".

100
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,387
You said you wanted a fresh.. these guys are more
plugged into the culture more than anybody I've got.

101
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,759
Oh maybe I should plug my business into another agency..

102
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:03,095
because they guys clearly miscalculated.

103
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,853
Looks like you guys miscalculated. That happens.

104
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:07,988
You know we did. We tried the
robots and doughnuts idea..

105
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,431
We thought it would be hot.. sticky..

106
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,478
They went for sticky and hot.

107
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:11,313
We thought it would have 'Pop".

108
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:14,191
It should have "Pop", didn't "Pop". I've never
seen anything like it. It happens.

109
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:17,264
What.. What is funny, is that this is our plan B.

110
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,856
We have a plan A, along the lines of what
you've been talking about.

111
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:21,935
You know.. tradition and quality.
Give us a couple of days.

112
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,251
A couple of days. A few days. Err, two days.

113
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:24,759
- Two days is good.
- Two days ...

114
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,442
That's all they need. Two days. You can do that. Ya?

115
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,437
No.

116
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:31,830
- Excuse me?
- I mean yeah, we can come up with something else. No problem.

117
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:34,294
But it's not gonna be as good as this.

118
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,278
Oh, wait a minute..

119
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,585
No! This is really good ...

120
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,988
really creative, out-of-the-box stuff here..

121
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:42,835
and if you can't see that, I dont think it's our problem..
I think that's your problem.

122
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:46,283
And maybe this isn't the right agency for you.
Cause I tell you something..

123
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,976
It's not about wether or not your doughtnot is delicious..

124
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:51,629
It's about you bringing your brand into the 21st century.

125
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:56,817
This is bullshit, Jerry.

126
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,517
What the fuck! Was that?

127
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,375
Guys.. Guys..

128
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:08,850
Fine, you got me.

129
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,540
We'll do it your way.

130
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:13,677
Personally I don't get it, but uh.. we'll pitch my dad.

131
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,372
God, you guys got balls.

132
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,329
Oh yea, they got two.. four big ball.

133
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,434
big..

134
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,223
Incredible.

135
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:28,077
That was.. amazing.

136
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,282
I don't want to say it but
I'm proud of you man.

137
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,141
I don't know which way it's gonna go..

138
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,833
you played that guy perfectly.

139
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,628
Perfectly, man!

140
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,803
I was'nt playing him. Jerry.

141
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:39,311
I'm just sick with the bullshit in my life

142
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:41,349
- Good for you.
- Yeah, I'm tired of it.

143
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,628
I'm tired of the
one-night stand..

144
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:46,694
I'm tired of.. of crashing at your place for the past six months..

145
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,489
and I'm tired of feeling
sorry for myself ...

146
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:51,340
because my fiancée
slept with some dick from the gym

147
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,511
and then dump me after 5 fantastic years together.

148
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:54,792
Good, vent!

149
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,253
- I just.. I'm taking a stand against bullshit.
- Get it out.

150
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,951
- You want to know what my credo is, Jerry?
- What's that?

151
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:00,002
No more bullshit.

152
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,051
I love that credo. Great, let's celebrate that credo tonight.

153
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:05,288
I've got an amazing situation lined up for us tonight.

154
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,600
- Jerry.
- Yeah?

155
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:09,418
Why shouldn't you just, get the slightest
bit sick of me? Little bit?

156
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:11,116
Sick of you? No.

157
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,708
We work together, we live together ...

158
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:14,601
we hang out together every night ...

159
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,359
it.. that's not healthy.

160
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,762
- What's not healthy?
- Us!

161
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,834
- What're you saying? What, you got plans tonight?
- Yes

162
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,216
Okay. Good. What are we doing?

163
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:22,749
Thank you.

164
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,139
- Fucker!
- Sorry, sorry.

165
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:39,894
Hey, hey wait!

166
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:04,144
What, Jerry?

167
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,640
Yea listen up, Phoebe, Giselle and the girls ...

168
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:08,241
want to talk about airbrushing and retouching

169
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,229
and I told my art director was on his way

170
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,249
Uh-huh.

171
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,811
Listen, get your ass back to "Pussy Town" man,
we're about to play "Spin the models".

172
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,539
Alright. Sounds good, man. Have a good time!

173
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:16,569
Alright, bye!

174
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,657
First time?

175
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:22,962
Uhh, yeah.

176
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:24,904
Burton.

177
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,303
Andy.

178
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,676
Did you call Helen to let her know you're coming?

179
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:33,130
No, actually.

180
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,022
Just wandered off the street?

181
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,125
- Kinda, yea.
- Fate.

182
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:41,574
Shall we?

183
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,943
They're not gonna bite.

184
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,585
Unless you ask them nicely.

185
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,598
Okay everybody. Let's take our seat.

186
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,164
It's an exciting day.

187
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:58,409
We have somebody brand new wants to come
and join the group.

188
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,325
Please come sit down, right here. There's a chair for you.

189
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen. May I introduce, Andy.

190
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:08,004
- Hi, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

191
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,753
And Andy would like permission to join our group.
Any objections?

192
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,051
Okay. Welcome.

193
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,320
I would like to start the introduction.

194
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:19,526
I'm Burton ...

195
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:20,970
And I'm a sex addict.

196
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:25,574
I'm Tiffany, I'm a sex addict too.

197
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:28,064
But I'm celebrating 94 days now.

198
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,845
I'm Franny. I'm addicted to love ...

199
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:33,955
and I love to love bad men.

200
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,482
My name is Herman, December 10th..

201
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:38,441
I'll have 19 years hooker-free.

202
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,426
I'm Ramon, you know why I'm here.

203
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,598
Hye. Donny. Sex addict.

204
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:45,250
Unemployed, compulsive masturbator.
How's everyone doing?

205
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,807
Hi, I'm Vanessa ...

206
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,492
and I am addicted to sex.

207
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,886
Dude, this is genious.
Why did'nt we think of this before?

208
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:03,207
I mean this is better than the Pilates, Bible study.
That book club that we joined.

209
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:05,060
Tell me about this chick.

210
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,233
What's this nymphit? What's her kink?

211
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,539
Hey, her name is Vanessa ...

212
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,265
and she is a sex and love addict.

213
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:14,397
Okay, so what's she into? Last bottom boat?
Space docking?

214
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:16,325
velging, cleveland steamer, the blumpkin..

215
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:17,917
the chilly dog, the rusty trambones,

216
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:20,161
the dirty sanchez.. What's she like?

217
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:21,342
What is wrong with you?

218
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,136
Jerry, it's a disease. Okay?

219
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,343
- Can we show her some respect, please?
- A "Disease"?

220
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:26,623
It's not a disease, Andy.

221
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,194
A disease is when you
wake up with some chick..

222
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:30,017
and she got crusted cheese in her underwear.
She's got to go to the hospital.

223
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:31,099
That's a disease.

224
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,376
You're really into this nymph. Good for you.

225
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,952
You know what, this is something that's.. that's weird..

226
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:41,565
she said she recently left Jumbo's Clown Room.. right..

227
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:44,351
and that this Jumbo's Clown Room was ...

228
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:46,273
this really dangerous place for her.

229
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:49,088
And I know, it's gotta be a metaphor for something..
but I think..

230
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:53,376
What, is she like..traumatized by party clown?
When she was a kid or something?

231
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:55,998
- Jumbo's Clown Room huh?
- Yeah, Jumbo's Clown Room.

232
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,587
Maybe that's what she call her vagina.
Maybe it's just so big and so much fun

233
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,235
Jerry, don't make fun of her. It's very sad.

234
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:04,312
[ Jumbo's Clown Room ]

235
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:09,402
No, no, no, no, no. I'm telling ya' this is a
terrible coincidence.

236
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:10,880
There's no way she worked here.

237
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:13,311
Do you have any idea how much cash this chicks
reeks in every night?

238
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:15,830
Please, it does not matter, I'm telling you
there's no way Vanessa worked here.

239
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:16,984
Vanessa worked here.

240
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,332
She seals my heart at.

241
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:22,421
Oh.. this is sad Andy, you're right. Oh, so sad..

242
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,989
Alright, alright, alright she used to work here. Right?

243
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,372
which means that she quit..

244
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:27,773
which means.. that she's making real progress.
Thank you.

245
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,813
Yea, so was I. Hey, keep digging. OK?

246
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,325
We haven't struck oil yet.

247
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,134
- Pretty sure this is illegal, man.
- Okay.

248
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:37,083
Have you ever dated a nice guy?

249
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,189
We're not really taking about me right now, but..

250
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:41,661
that's the thing

251
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:45,686
What are you doing?

252
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:48,793
Can you see that?

253
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:51,572
What?

254
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:56,306
Oh, someone is doing something huge today.

255
00:14:57,053 --> 00:14:58,296
Earth shattering.

256
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,494
Lives changing huge.

257
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:04,377
What is it?

258
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,641
He's here.

259
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:09,715
Who?

260
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:11,029
You.

261
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:13,878
Okay everybody, let's come together..

262
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,385
we have a limited amount of time.

263
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:19,121
So, after.. after I.. you know, pleasured myself..

264
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:20,720
in every room in the apartment ...

265
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,400
and also the.. the laundry room..

266
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,058
- And the lobby
- Right.

267
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,299
A couple of times, I needed to get out..

268
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,768
so I.. I went to get my haircut.

269
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,417
- You looks great.
- Thanks man.

270
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,683
- But err, you know how they gave you a shampoo beforehand..
- It's very creamy.

271
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:38,929
Favourite part.

272
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,570
And err, the woman they have there ...

273
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:45,908
she really gets in there, on the scalp,
and she really rubs your head..

274
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,593
and she smells good, and
the shampoo smells so good.

275
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,343
and I'm wearing an apron right? So I.. I figured..

276
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:52,875
Who's gonna notice?

277
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,139
- She noticed.
- Duh~

278
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,061
Ramon.

279
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,898
That's my second strike.

280
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:04,274
- Did she call the cop?
- Yeah.

281
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,949
One more.. and I'm doing serious time.

282
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,908
Then if that's true, Donny?

283
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:12,426
What is your bottomline, this coming week?

284
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:15,754
- Only at home.
- Here's the question..

285
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,353
Can you handle that?

286
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,873
- I think that I can.
- I know you can.

287
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,401
Because I've been getting into
the whole condiment things, lately.

288
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,891
- Oh, tell us about that.
- It's all in my fridge.

289
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:28,268
It's genious, right?

290
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,258
Mayo' I mean that's a given. That's old school.

291
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,362
The kids are doing that, but the mustard ...

292
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:33,545
what? Totally.

293
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,954
Tabasco sauce you have to be careful with..

294
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,384
because if it gets in your urethra,
burn the shit out of ya'..

295
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,231
Yea, right at the tip of the penis.

296
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:43,599
But the.. relish ..

297
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:45,671
relish!

298
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:46,921
because it's bumpy.

299
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,462
Good meeting girls.

300
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,226
See you next week.

301
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,340
Uh excuse me, Vanessa.

302
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:59,401
I was wondering maybe sometime you'd be interested
in getting a cup of coffee with me or something?.. and..

303
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:07,916
Andy!

304
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:09,924
Hey, I'm Herman, this is Donny.

305
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,754
- Hey.
- Hey.

306
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:13,349
Donny.

307
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,275
Err, we're gonna get something to eat..

308
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:18,407
- Good, have fun.
- Yeah..

309
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,160
- We are.. gonna get something to eat.
- Yeah.

310
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:24,930
There's this place down by where I live..

311
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:28,233
they've got a whole section devoted
exclusively to the anus.

312
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,154
And I'm not talking about gay anus..

313
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,074
I'm talking hetero' anus.

314
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:33,634
They've got like a thousand title..

315
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,650
One month I spent $ 2,000 in there..

316
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,602
I maxed up my Visa, Mastercard, Optima..

317
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:41,066
What can I say, I'm a tush man..

318
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:44,545
You know, the asshole is the new vagina.

319
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,178
Yes it is.

320
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,097
Hey. Here's a little tush for the tush man, hmm?

321
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,545
- Hey Mr, Cleavage.
- Hello.

322
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:53,664
I gotta' a date tonight.

323
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,679
What do you think? I mean, you know ...

324
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,825
I can like, put 'em like this..

325
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,191
or maybe push 'em in and.. lift 'em up at the same time.

326
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:02,728
Those are all good options ...

327
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,996
but I.. I think that's erm.. false advertising..

328
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:08,708
because that's not what they're gonna look like,
for realsies when I get up in there.

329
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,011
I will fuck you in half, you little pygmy.

330
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:14,084
Who's the new meat? Hurm~

331
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:15,678
Urm, Lisa, this is Andy.

332
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:16,994
- Hey, Andy.
- Hi.

333
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:19,745
- What's your kink?
- I'm sorry? What's my kink?

334
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,597
Ya, come on, man. I've been serving these sickos for years.. please..

335
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:26,405
This one, beats his dick like it owes him money.

336
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:28,924
That one, would drill a hole in a ham and fuck it.

337
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,859
What's you thing, Andy? What's your freaky freaky thang'?

338
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,833
Well, to be completely honest with you,
I'm not into the freaky freaky.

339
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,090
Yeah, me neither.

340
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,483
I was in there for a second, I was really in there.

341
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:50,236
Back in a minute.

342
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:54,233
Donny, how's that only at home going for ya'.

343
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:57,022
He tries.

344
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:59,162
Listen, I'm gonna get going. So thanks a lot for everything..

345
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,177
No, I just want to talk with ya' up first, Andy..

346
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,038
I noticed that you've err...

347
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,113
taken a special interest in Vanessa..

348
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,345
- Vanessa? No, I haven't..
- Well, I would'nt blame ya.

349
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,337
I mean she's beautiful, smart, funny ...

350
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:12,409
talented, I mean.. makes sense.

351
00:19:12,514 --> 00:19:15,415
But, a couple of months ago, she was a mess.

352
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:18,488
And she was strippin' every night at Jumbo's.

353
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:20,764
And uh, she's come a long way..

354
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:23,548
because of the group. I got her a job ...

355
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,012
with Dr. Pete Craig, he's a veterinarian.

356
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,478
We got her to move out of Luke's place and..

357
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:31,925
she's really a set. I am very proud of her.

358
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:35,065
That's why we have an ironclad rule..

359
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:38,134
you can not date anyone else in the group ...

360
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,020
ever.

361
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,045
Not negotiable.

362
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,764
Do you understand what I'm saying?

363
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:46,196
Oh yeah, no, no, I understand.

364
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:49,592
Yeah.

365
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:51,418
Hey, guys, what did I miss?

366
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:53,458
Oh, I was giving him the talk.

367
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:55,420
Oh, the talk, good.

368
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:56,280
How did it go?

369
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:59,414
I think Andy understands it very, very well.

370
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:01,938
- Good.
- Hey, you guys finished it here?

371
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:04,216
- You want me to wrap this up, to go?
- Yes, please.

372
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,803
Oh, can i get a side of relish in it to go?

373
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:10,357
I will kick you in the cunt, you little douche.

374
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:15,730
Well, we're out of relish.

375
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:18,322
- Oh no, you did'nt.
- Urgh, what a discovery man.

376
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,361
That freak is like the Christopher
Columbus of wacking off..

377
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:22,710
I had it rested
between my legs ...

378
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,337
looks like a dodger dodge.

379
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:25,620
- What else did you learn?
- Nothing.

380
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:28,056
Nothing? What did you mean with nothing?
You're breaking breads with this sickos..

381
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:30,226
- You're an honorary pervert.
- Yeah, that's exactly the problem, because they

382
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,104
have all this rules. The worst one is that
members can't date other member.

383
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,496
I don't know who am I kidding.
This is impossible.

384
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:39,415
Oww, nothing's impossible man. This
rules don't apply to you.

385
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:42,642
So you can't date other member that
you meet in the group, meet her somewhere else.

386
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,369
This one.. I'm thinking of taking it home myself.

387
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:50,838
- Uh huh..
- She's fixed..

388
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:53,171
looking for a loving home, she's just got all her shots.

389
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:54,415
I don't think so.

390
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,507
Are you sure? They dont get any sweeter, don't they?

391
00:20:58,615 --> 00:21:01,036
- I can see that.
- There's no one sweeter than me~..

392
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,917
Well, what kind of dog are you looking for?

393
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,852
Well.. injured.

394
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:26,064
Tell you what.

395
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:27,690
You help me make a good impression..

396
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:30,348
I scratch your tummy for you.

397
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,109
Like this. This is a little taste of it.

398
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:33,706
Like that?

399
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:36,626
You like when I scratch your tummy..

400
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:43,367
Oh shit. Oh Shit!

401
00:21:56,593 --> 00:21:58,348
- Hey.
- Hi.

402
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,358
Uh, wow! What a coincidence.

403
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,187
It's me, Andy, from the meetings.

404
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,335
Yeah.

405
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,228
Yea, I know who you are.

406
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,552
An accident, on me.

407
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:12,583
So crazy running into you like this.
I can't believe this.

408
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,923
You know what, I think you made a mistake.

409
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:17,259
You wrote Andy down, as the dog's name.

410
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,286
Yea, yeah, it's name Andy
too. Yea, we're both, we're both Andy.

411
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,375
You know, he's really a.. sweet and,
and caring, and just a great companion..

412
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,972
You know that Andy all he wants is love.

413
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:29,506
You mean "she."

414
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:31,629
- Yeah, she of course.
- Okay.

415
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,823
So, what is the matter with.. Andy?

416
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,069
Arh, her leg.

417
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,469
It's missing.

418
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:41,416
It's very sad.

419
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:44,582
But you.. are working with
animals and helping them.. That's amaz..

420
00:22:44,684 --> 00:22:46,309
- How rewarding is..
- Why are you here?

421
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:49,444
I really wanna grab that
coffee with you sometime.

422
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:52,864
And I've been out with Herman and Donny,
and they gave me the whole talk ...

423
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,661
so I know all the rules .. but..

424
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,769
you ran out before I got a chance to tell you ...

425
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,567
I'm not an addict..

426
00:22:58,666 --> 00:22:59,745
so there's really no problem with us..

427
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:01,792
You're not.. a sex addict?

428
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,537
I know, I sound really crazy but ...

429
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:07,680
listen..

430
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,378
I'm a good person ..

431
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:12,001
and I just really want to get to know you better.

432
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,432
Well, I can't discuss this here..

433
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:16,805
but I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow. Alright?

434
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,554
The doctor will be right in. Bye, Andy. Bye baby.

435
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,581
I can handle the Halitosis..

436
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,166
But I don't know guys, if I can commit..

437
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,245
to a man who falls asleep..

438
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:35,524
during foreplay.

439
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,786
Two hours of Cunnilingus is a lot to ask..

440
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:41,787
- Of any man.
- Maybe that's where he gets the Halitosis.

441
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:44,096
Seriously, not to mention the lockjaw, man.

442
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:45,921
My jaw hurts just hearing that story, am I right?

443
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:47,876
- Ramon..
- Yes, I'm sorry.

444
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,631
Thank you so much for your insight.

445
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:53,469
Vanessa, I think you're up.

446
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:56,419
Well, I got a gig of my own.

447
00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:58,783
Great.

448
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:03,640
The place was a total dive, and there's like, I don't know,
three people there but ...

449
00:24:03,748 --> 00:24:06,911
it's the first thing that I've
done without Luke as my manager.

450
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:09,912
Is that douchebag still holding
your demo tape hostage?

451
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,880
Yea, he still has the demo tape but
there's really nothing I can do about that ...

452
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,855
But you know what
I can do, you know what I'm going to do?

453
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,780
I'm moving out, I'm moving in with Tiff.

454
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,634
Roommates!

455
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,960
- Sleepover!
- That is wonderful.

456
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:28,984
Alright now for you, the next time you fall in love with somebody..

457
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,543
he's gonna be a guy that take care of you ...

458
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,430
who will not manipulate you with sex ...

459
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:37,757
- Am I right?
- I did meet someone recently.

460
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,416
Could you tell us about that?

461
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,519
Well actually it's someone right here in this room.

462
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,250
Yea, this person ...

463
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:52,376
Has made me realize how ready I am to meet
a decent, honorable guy.

464
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:56,089
And that's because he's not decent or honorable.

465
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:58,292
He saw me sing ...

466
00:24:58,398 --> 00:24:59,772
Came looking for me at Jumbo's ...

467
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,258
he did'nt think that I knew about that, but I did.

468
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:07,154
And he came to see me at work yesterday
pretending it was a coincidence.

469
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:10,010
And when I walk into the examination room..

470
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,141
I caught him spanking it through his pant in front of a crippled dog.

471
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,171
I was not!

472
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,514
Who are you and what are you doing here?

473
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:23,538
This is the only place in my life where I feel completely safe.

474
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:26,544
And if you're just gonna come in here and ruin it for me..

475
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:29,365
then you better have
a damn good explanation.

476
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:31,320
Hell yeah, you better have a good explanation.

477
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:34,200
You better start talking right now bro, I don't hear anything.

478
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,378
Come on, man. Say something.

479
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:37,270
Excuse me, young man...

480
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,500
Don't you feel compelled to
answer any of those allegations?

481
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:49,613
Guess what guys, I'm not a sex addict.

482
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,475
Bullshit!

483
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:54,511
I'm only here.. because I wanted to meet Vanessa.

484
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:56,339
I saw her sing that night ...

485
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,221
and then I followed her here.

486
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,358
Yea, right, okay, it's clear as it got.

487
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:03,669
You go cruising..

488
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:05,741
you meet a stranger, become obsessed ...

489
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:07,341
you stalk her..

490
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,682
you masturbate in her office ...

491
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:12,748
textbook. Please, please. Welcome.

492
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:15,755
- What? It's not textbook, it's crazy ...
- Andy, Andy..

493
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,574
- It's time to come clean, man.
- What?

494
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,262
Be honest with yourself,
you lying piece of shit!

495
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:23,753
- Come on, bro. Spit it out.
- Andy ...

496
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:26,795
this is what we call
an "intervention."

497
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,874
No, no, no Herman, this is my girl and..

498
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,052
and he lied to us, and he used us..

499
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,522
and for that, you are going down!

500
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,157
I did'nt do anything. What?

501
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:47,208
Alright, alright, fine! I am a sex crazed..

502
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,168
a sexy, horny

503
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:51,568
a sex.. sex monkey, okay?

504
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:54,186
- Is that what you want to hear?
- Yes, that's what we want to hear.

505
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,751
Squeeze it out. Push it out. Purge yourself!

506
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,784
I'll squeeze, I'll squeeze! You want to hear some squeeze?

507
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:00,870
I'll tell ya' this ...

508
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:05,421
I, I, I love women. I love women! Alright?!

509
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,204
I live to please.. them! Alright?!

510
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:11,718
And when I.. when I work that G-Spot ..

511
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:14,212
you know, when I..

512
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,101
when I do that ... It's like "boom"!

513
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:19,914
Mr. G-Spot! That's what they call me.

514
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,869
-What do they call me?!
- Mr. G-Spot!

515
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:24,900
-What do they fuckin' call me?!
- Mr. G-Spot!

516
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:27,338
That's right. Mr. G-Spot!

517
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:31,396
I live in "Pussy Town".

518
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:33,257
Yeah, I live in ...

519
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:36,619
- I'm on the city council of "Pussy Town".
- I know what you mean.

520
00:27:36,717 --> 00:27:40,458
Oh, my tongue, my tongue. I'll tell you about my tongue!

521
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:42,660
The things I do with my tongue. Oh yes!..

522
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:44,455
I can lick with it ...

523
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:46,410
and I.. I suck with it ...

524
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:48,647
yeah, yeah!

525
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:49,641
so ...

526
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:53,571
- Andy..
- What?

527
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:55,050
Welcome home.

528
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:16,479
Watch this takes. It's where it builds.
It's dynamic.

529
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:41,286
Oh, you've tweaked that, dog~

530
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:44,796
It gets better. So what do you guys think?

531
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,665
It was.. what was it Andy?

532
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:51,391
Perff, dreadful.

533
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,206
Err.. What didn't you like about it?

534
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,131
We do not like ...

535
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:58,180
the part where you were...

536
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:00,927
pressing the keys down and making noise.

537
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:03,068
Everything else was spot on, you know, the hair ...

538
00:29:03,172 --> 00:29:05,343
love that, love that you were
spitting while you were singing..

539
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,938
River's got half his
Breakfast in his beard ...

540
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:08,320
I love to know what he have for breakfast this morning.

541
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,174
- That was good.
- That was good~.

542
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:14,530
So err, mangled spitting, singing, those were good notes.

543
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,830
Good meeting, guys. Let's crank it up!

544
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:20,600
What? Come on.

545
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:23,705
- They are a great musical team.
- I know, I know...

546
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,849
I'm not worried about them..

547
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,863
Vanessa is just...

548
00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:33,366
Look, Andy. I'm not gonna lie to ya'.
This is a rough situation.

549
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,061
I mean, maybe I'm missing something..

550
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,405
but, this girl is.. a sex addict.

551
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:38,552
Right? Which mean she is addicted to sex.

552
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:42,039
Hello? Low hanging fruit!
Pull it off the goddamn tree already!

553
00:29:42,144 --> 00:29:44,085
Are you listening to anything I'm saying?

554
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:47,191
- She hates me.
- I know, she hates you! Which is a good thing.

555
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:49,303
Hatred is like foreplay for this sex monsters.

556
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:51,643
You know you belong in
these meetings. You know that right?

557
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:54,360
You should have seen what kind of freak they
thought I was when I started talking like you

558
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:56,699
Okay. Well you clearly used me
out of context.. 'cause..

559
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,653
what I have is a
gift, not a disease.

560
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,058
- Oh, you're a gift?
- Yes!

561
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:03,321
Every woman has at least one thing that
gets her highly excitable.

562
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:05,363
I find out what that one thing is and I work it.

563
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,153
Until ecstasy is the inevitable result. Exactly!

564
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:10,075
This is a skill that very few possess.

565
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:11,634
It's a God given talent, Andy.

566
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,977
You know what, I'll clarify at the next meeting.

567
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:16,345
Yea.. Wait. What? No..

568
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:21,495
Hey, hey. Look, look right here. That is never going to happen.
You understand that? You are never ever coming to a meeting with me. You got it?

569
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:23,832
You know what you need?
Fresh perspective.

570
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:29,592
Come on, look at the way she controls
that beast with her thigh muscles.

571
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:34,130
That's the way they talk to the horses, you know.
With the thigh muscles.

572
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,445
That's good.

573
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:38,197
Oh man, women who
ride horses are super sexualized. That's a fact.

574
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:39,858
And that's why young girls loves unicorn.

575
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:41,685
It's essentially white horses with a dick on its' head.

576
00:30:42,202 --> 00:30:44,656
It's a no brainer. We go down to the equestrian centre..

577
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,760
we stand on the side of the field,
we wait for them to just ride around to get wet and ready.

578
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:49,752
That's what riding does, it gets them all
wet and ready.

579
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:50,863
What? I'm serious.

580
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:53,521
When that chick gets off her horse,
she's gonna go rub one out.

581
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,828
And we'll be the only thing standing
between that horse and that chick..

582
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,396
doing her beef trips.

583
00:30:57,496 --> 00:30:59,405
Oh, please don't say "beef trips."

584
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:02,896
Look at them bounce. I love it.

585
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:06,804
- Hello?
- Who's that?

586
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:08,244
- Donny.
- Is that relish?

587
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,710
- Tell him I'm a fan. I'm a fan relish!
- Shut up.

588
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:14,379
- Yea, what's the problem?
- Andy, get off the phone. Come on man, fresh perspective.

589
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:16,591
- There's a problem with Herman.
- Who the fuck's Herman?

590
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:19,344
- It's one of the guys in the group.
- Oh, come on. The hell's with them, let's go!

591
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:23,820
- Wait, hooker!?
- Andy, Andy. Come on man, the jumpers alone cost me $300.

592
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:24,972
Are you coming?

593
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,157
- There he is, there he is.
- Oh, alright.

594
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,668
- What's going on?
- A'ight, here's the situation..

595
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,040
he's been in his van for almost an hour.
We tried to talk him down.

596
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:43,593
- Nothing's working, bro.
-I.. I thought he called you guys for help?

597
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,066
- Yea, he did.
- Yes, there is.. there was a phone call, yes..

598
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:49,162
but then he just got this far away sound
in his voice and he was cut off.

599
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:52,081
like he wasn't himself anymore and
now he won't even answer his cellphone.

600
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,771
He totally shut us down, bro.

601
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:56,524
- What's up with that pant? Seriously.
- You ride?

602
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:58,960
Look, he'll listen to you, okay?
'Cause you've been there before..

603
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:01,578
- But we're ...
- Don't look at 'em, bro..

604
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:04,365
It is such a friendly neighborhood.
I gotta go. I'm in a good place right now..

605
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,440
and it's just not good to be here.
So I'm gonna bolt, good luck!

606
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:08,487
Seriously brother, this place is way too cheap, man..

607
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,047
you can get blonde for a bucket of chicken and
I just got paid, brother.

608
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:14,053
- We're out of here.
- What do you guys mean, you guys gotta bolt?

609
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,365
What am I supposed to.. I don't know what to say to him.

610
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:18,667
We're gay! We're gay!

611
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,620
You gotta be..!

612
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,578
Go away!

613
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,451
Alright.

614
00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:46,503
So, what's.. what's going on?

615
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:53,731
Whatever it is that you did..

616
00:32:53,836 --> 00:32:56,202
it's.. it's done now..

617
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,314
Why don't we just go home?

618
00:32:58,348 --> 00:33:01,576
I did'nt.. fucking.. do anything yet.

619
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:03,362
What do you mean?

620
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:05,921
Rock ...

621
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:08,902
Are we going to do some business or what?

622
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:11,009
It stinks like rat poison back here ...

623
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,772
and I didn't agree to no threeway.

624
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:16,420
You guys are kinky and little jocky?
No-uh, that's extra.

625
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:19,142
Did you forget how to blow?

626
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:22,241
- Fuck you, Ramon.
- You're not allowed, remember?

627
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:27,935
Shut up.

628
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,276
A hundred long lonely nights of celibacy.

629
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:34,692
Three things got me through.

630
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:36,446
My waterpick,

631
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:38,078
breaking boards to the head,

632
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:41,282
and seein' your ugly faces every week.

633
00:33:41,383 --> 00:33:43,804
That really killed my sex drive. I love you guys!

634
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:46,049
And love you too, Tiffany.

635
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,090
What are you freaks celebrating, huh?

636
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:51,523
Let me guess. You all got together, jizz on a cookie..

637
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:53,476
and you got to eat 'em, huh, mericon'..

638
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:55,838
I love you guys. I love you...

639
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:57,152
because you all wants to fuck me..

640
00:33:57,253 --> 00:33:59,456
and that's incredibly good for my self-esteem.

641
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:00,485
I'll go cut this up.

642
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,522
You know my self-esteem is not that high ...

643
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:05,443
but it would be a lot lower
if it were'nt for a special someone...

644
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,224
who got my ass out of a
very sticky situation.

645
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,778
- To Andy.
- No, I'm talking bout the hooker.

646
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:11,931
She's lookin' hot!

647
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:14,813
To Andy!

648
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:28,317
- It's raining.
- I know.

649
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:31,134
- I drive a scooter.
- Youre gonna get wet.

650
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:32,859
Damn it, open the door!

651
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:43,900
- I'll be just a minute.
- Take your time.

652
00:34:45,473 --> 00:34:48,123
Most of 'em are sleeping.
It's just this little girl right here...

653
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:51,257
who has a hard time. Yea, baby.

654
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:57,018
It's okay, Paula Abdul. I'm here now.

655
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:05,661
She only falls asleep in my arms.

656
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:08,348
Are you on the clock right now?

657
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,617
What am I supposed to do?

658
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,140
You know I think I might have misjudged you.

659
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,629
Yeah?

660
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,253
You're even sicker than I thought.

661
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,293
You're home late.

662
00:35:44,379 --> 00:35:46,320
Jesus Jerry, you scared the shit out of me.

663
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:48,975
Anywhere on your calendar does it
says "Drinks with Reeves?

664
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:53,043
Oh shit. I'm sorry, man.

665
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:54,517
I totally forgot about that.

666
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:57,583
Yea, apparently he was going to talk
with us about something important, something about our future..

667
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,703
Is he gonna make us partner?

668
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,467
Oh, I don't know, we were'nt there to find out.

669
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:05,237
What I do know, is that Dinki Donuts
would be the biggest account that Reeves' ever had

670
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:08,401
- Yea, I know.
- I also know that right now we have no shot at it.

671
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:09,809
Why?

672
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:12,434
Well, maybe it's because you're doing it again, Andy.

673
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:15,087
You're changing, you're becoming the object of your affection.

674
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:18,198
Will the real Andy grow a sack of nuts
and be counted for

675
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:19,722
who you are instead of who you're with.

676
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:21,107
Alright, you're talking out your ass.

677
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:23,214
Andy, I've known you since forever.
This is your fatal flaw.

678
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:26,634
With women you're a.. you're a
chameleon like one of those color changing lizards.

679
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,244
I know what a chameleon is, Jerry.

680
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:30,927
Come here. Sit down, I want to show you something
I've been working on a long time.

681
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:32,043
Andrew.

682
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:39,279
[ Andy Youngman :
Man of 1,000 Faces]

683
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:44,273
So ...

684
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:47,470
First, there was Heidi. Rar-rarr.

685
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,788
Getting all tubular and gnarly with Zoey.

686
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:54,411
I think she dumped you two weeks after
I took this photo if my memory serves.

687
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:57,995
Throwin' down mad rhymes with Tisha.

688
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:02,351
Aww, My. Earthy Poet Man.

689
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,580
See, I.. I can't even find you in this photo.

690
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,785
Come one, where the fuck are ya'?

691
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:13,638
Imagine that.

692
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:18,183
Whoops, wait a second. That's not
supposed to be in there.

693
00:37:19,313 --> 00:37:21,200
And finally, Cynthia.

694
00:37:21,296 --> 00:37:23,019
Or as I'd like to call her, Medusa ...

695
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,581
- The devil woman.
- Stop.

696
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:26,509
She was so much more deceptive than the others ...

697
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,516
because with her, see you looked like Andy ...

698
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:29,735
but you were'nt Andy.

699
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,522
It was like "Invasion body snatching pussy"

700
00:37:32,623 --> 00:37:34,215
Okay, thank you. You made your point.

701
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,206
Andy, what happened to your credo?

702
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:38,506
Huh, no more bullshit? What happen to that?

703
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:40,494
I mean, we've got a fuckin' three legged dog.

704
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:42,184
Named Andy.

705
00:37:43,214 --> 00:37:44,261
I love you.

706
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:46,121
Come on, pinky swear me right now..

707
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,945
that you are finished with these perverts.

708
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:49,506
I'm not gonna pinky anything with you.

709
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:51,554
I'm making real progress with Vanessa.

710
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:53,384
In case you haven't noticed, that's important to me.

711
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:56,042
I promise you this:

712
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:00,291
I will not lose sight of who I really am. Okay?

713
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:05,381
I just got obsessed by little men.

714
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:08,193
I'm addicted to hand jobs... from men.

715
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,795
My cock understands me.

716
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:13,957
I got really into mail order brides.

717
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,269
I don't know what ...

718
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:16,903
that old man wanted.

719
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:19,748
It was hard to hear through the
oxygen mask.

720
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,664
I started caressing his
penis, I couldn't help it.

721
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:26,311
I kept going to see them
little midget at them circus.

722
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,035
I'm not gay.

723
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:28,998
Just lazy.

724
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:30,787
The next thing I know, I was just being..

725
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,549
escorted out of the funeral parlor.

726
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:35,550
The smell of tapioca just..

727
00:38:35,657 --> 00:38:36,485
it made my dick hard.

728
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:39,136
When it gets angry, it kinda look like..

729
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,344
Karl Malden's nose, you know, kinda' bulbous.

730
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:44,611
I can not stop. I have to have it.

731
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:47,391
He said "Hey man, I'm not gay."

732
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:50,625
And I'm like, "Shit, that's..
that's just good business." You know.

733
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:53,061
I had two of them fucked me in that little midget car.

734
00:38:53,543 --> 00:38:55,004
I mean, little people.

735
00:38:55,143 --> 00:38:57,564
People look at you funny if
you pull your cock out in public.

736
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:03,323
Thanks. Thanks alot. It was awesome.

737
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:12,162
Oh my god. She lived in this dump
with that animal for 2 years.

738
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:14,749
Where's this animal now?

739
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,063
He's at work. We're good.

740
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:18,105
So where's.. where's the demo..
where did she say it was?

741
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:20,448
She said there, in the bedroom.

742
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:22,587
There are weapons on the table, fellas.

743
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:24,863
I don't feel good about this.

744
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,452
This is not our places.

745
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:30,433
Okay. Let's go.

746
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,285
It smells like old socks.

747
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:35,677
I think I'm havin' a panic attack.

748
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:37,654
I have it.

749
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,801
Let's get out of here before the animal gets back.

750
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:40,887
Oh shit.

751
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:45,439
So, which one of you called me an animal?

752
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:48,792
Too ugly. Too fat.

753
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:51,995
So, you. You must the one doin' her.

754
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,424
Sweet piece of ass, huh?

755
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:57,397
Hey, animal, watch your mouth.

756
00:39:57,503 --> 00:39:59,161
Yea, that's not necessary, man.

757
00:40:00,895 --> 00:40:01,723
" Not necessary ?"

758
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:04,505
Check out the white knight
protecting his lady's honor.

759
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,744
You care to duel, "Sir Puss Alot"?

760
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,472
Yea, duel him.

761
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:10,488
I'm talking to you, ass hat.

762
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,142
Yea, I heard you. No, no I don't care to duel.

763
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,318
Besides, there's three of us..

764
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:16,850
So we can kick your ass.

765
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,258
Donny, get back here right now.

766
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:23,099
What do you got there?

767
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:25,978
Those happen to be my demos, that I produced..

768
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:27,767
spent six grand on.

769
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,900
Fuck it. She can have 'em.

770
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:32,596
That girl got no talent.

771
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:34,704
Tell her I'm keeping the mattress tho'...

772
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,022
as a souvenir.

773
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:37,684
It's the only place she was ever any use to me.

774
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:39,348
Okay, we'll tell her.

775
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:42,833
If I ever see you fella again it won't go so friendly.

776
00:40:43,515 --> 00:40:45,173
- You got that, "Puss"?
- We got it.

777
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:48,144
No, no, no. He was talking to Andy.
He was calling Andy a pussy.

778
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:51,095
I don't think you understand or appreciate
the urgency of the situation.

779
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:53,649
We fly to Phoenix in two days
to pitch the campaign.

780
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:58,128
- Two days. So just tell me that we're still a team.
- Yeah, Jerry. Yes, of course we're a team.

781
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:01,014
You're the talent, and I'm the salesman.

782
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:02,389
If you don't do your job,
I have nothing to sell.

783
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:04,561
Your priorities are way out of whack.

784
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:07,348
You're spending every second with
these t-baggers and chicken chokers and..

785
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:10,296
- They're taking over our lives.
-That is not true.

786
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:12,629
- It is not true.
- Okay, well, show...

787
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,788
What? We needed an office guy.

788
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,241
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

789
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:25,717
I wrote a song for you.

790
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,077
You're kidding me.

791
00:41:29,174 --> 00:41:31,475
You rescued my demo tape. It's the least I could do.

792
00:41:32,246 --> 00:41:34,100
Oh, I heard you were very gallant by the way..

793
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:36,205
"Sir Puss-Alot"?

794
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,804
Yea..

795
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,973
But I really.. I really didn't do anything.

796
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:42,931
Actually, you kinda' did.

797
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,765
I sent it to a couple of producers
and this guy want me to showcase

798
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:48,046
at a party tomorrow night.

799
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:49,936
Tomorrow? That's incredible.

800
00:41:50,036 --> 00:41:52,817
Alright, alright.
Just shut up and listen to my song.

801
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,410
I can't believe you wrote
a song for me.

802
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:07,403
"THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU"

803
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:11,499
"THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND"

804
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:14,351
"SOMETHING IN THE WAY YOU FEEL"

805
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:18,408
"WHEN I HOLD YOU IN MY HAND"

806
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:22,124
"SOMEDAY SOON
SURE AS YOUR GLAZE"

807
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:26,763
"THAT SHINES FOR ALL TO SEE"

808
00:42:26,864 --> 00:42:29,929
"WE'LL BE TOGETHER"

809
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:34,500
"MY DINKI DONUTS"

810
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,145
"DINKI DONUTS"

811
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:42,503
"AND I.."

812
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:57,889
Wow.

813
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,586
It's not good, I know that.

814
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:02,376
Donny just.. he told me
that you guys are struggling..

815
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:04,548
so I came up with something as a joke. Really.

816
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:06,823
No, no, I don't think you were joking.

817
00:43:06,924 --> 00:43:08,352
You hated it, right?

818
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,604
Actually, urm..

819
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,068
I kinda' loved it.

820
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:14,184
No way.

821
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:15,493
Yes way.

822
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:21,030
Andy, why do you seduce
all those women?

823
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:25,285
Multiple partners is not what turns me on.

824
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:28,229
It gets in the way with what
really matters..

825
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:30,914
intimacy, romances, commitment.

826
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:33,700
Yes, yes. I think, that is exactly what ...

827
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:39,332
I have a friend.. a friend who
believes in all that stuff you believes in.

828
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:44,029
He was.. he was supposed to get married
to this woman, Cynthia..

829
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:47,168
but six weeks before the wedding..

830
00:43:47,272 --> 00:43:49,410
she sleeps with some guy from the gym..

831
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:52,031
- And dumps him.
- Oh god.

832
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:55,746
And he was completely destroyed.
But even after all that..

833
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,570
he still believes in true love.

834
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:59,492
And even love at first sight.

835
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:02,340
- Oh, he sounds like a great guy.
- He's a great guy.

836
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:04,380
He just gave his heart to
the wrong girl, that's all.

837
00:44:04,486 --> 00:44:05,379
A great guy.

838
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:12,347
So you tell me, Mr. G-Spot..

839
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,771
What makes you such a good lover?

840
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:19,266
I.. pay attention.

841
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,017
That's the secret.

842
00:44:22,308 --> 00:44:25,787
I mean, every woman has at least..

843
00:44:25,892 --> 00:44:29,088
one thing.. that, you know,
makes her highly excitable. So..

844
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:34,111
I just.. I find out what that
one thing is and work it until..

845
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:38,590
ecstasy is the inevitable result.

846
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:41,310
You know what gets me highly excitable?

847
00:44:41,698 --> 00:44:43,999
Red wine, Merlot.

848
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,683
A guy all sweaty after work out,

849
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:47,865
smelling like a man.

850
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,140
Red wine, sweaty, that's good stuff. Interesting.

851
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:51,872
My feet.

852
00:44:52,513 --> 00:44:54,268
If you give me a foot massage..

853
00:44:54,785 --> 00:44:58,133
And I will lose all control.

854
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:02,549
Feet.

855
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:07,289
Why don't you show me one of your secret.

856
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:11,548
Okay.

857
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:29,754
Oh my god.

858
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:37,916
I bet you make girls crazy just by doing this.

859
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:46,579
- I'm being a bad girl, right now?
- Ya, me too.

860
00:45:50,235 --> 00:45:51,063
I.. gotta go.

861
00:45:52,955 --> 00:45:54,776
- Am I going somewhere with you.. or..?
- No..

862
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,467
We both have big days tomorrow.

863
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,958
- Good luck with your pitchy, Andy.
- Wait.

864
00:46:11,385 --> 00:46:13,206
Why she just turn me off like that?

865
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:15,757
You know, she tells me all this
things that gets her off..

866
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:17,205
Like a Merlot..

867
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:19,408
a guy all sweaty after a work out..

868
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:20,493
a foot massage..

869
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,672
Why would she tell me if she wasn't into me?

870
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:23,790
I don't know.

871
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:26,829
This is only the most important day
of our professional lives.

872
00:46:26,935 --> 00:46:28,789
Let's get our head in the game, okay?

873
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,163
Vitamins. Vitamins.

874
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:36,595
Lets get real.

875
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:38,766
I was wrong. Alright?

876
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,252
Your ideas are great,
really sharp and err..

877
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:44,212
Well, you know,
I don't know what that lingo, but err...

878
00:46:44,342 --> 00:46:45,618
I think my dad's gonna like your pitch.

879
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:48,050
You've got big balls, kid.

880
00:46:48,149 --> 00:46:49,359
Hung like a grandfather clock.

881
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:52,176
Take good care of this guys, Ted.

882
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,324
Might have to steal them away from you.

883
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:58,163
Hey, don't.. don't threaten me,
Alan. No, no, cause I'm making these two guys partners.

884
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,649
Yeah!

885
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:03,727
- Salud!
- Here we are.

886
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,956
- Sandy.
- Hey Alan, how are you?

887
00:47:15,058 --> 00:47:16,486
- Yea, good.
- Good.

888
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:18,830
Good evening, gentlemen. How are you?

889
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,718
We have a great sushi buffet on board..

890
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:22,890
and some dynamite wine you're just gonna' love.

891
00:47:22,994 --> 00:47:26,768
But there's another plane behind us on the runway
and we are on a tight schedule.

892
00:47:28,273 --> 00:47:30,825
I bet I can find a hole in that
tight schedule.

893
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:32,652
Red Eye to Cleveland last week.

894
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:35,850
Sex on the airplane. That happens.

895
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,487
Excuse me.

896
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,534
I think we all realized
what he was talking about.

897
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:41,670
Okay, alright, alright.

898
00:47:42,095 --> 00:47:44,298
Jerry, you are such an idiot ...

899
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:48,775
- Hello?
- Leave me alone!

900
00:47:48,878 --> 00:47:50,438
- Who is this?
- Andy, thank God!

901
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,930
Herman and.. Tiffany..
Nobodies answered my calls.. just..

902
00:47:54,126 --> 00:47:55,718
God, I'm such an idiot.

903
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:57,926
- Vanessa, are you alright?
- Andy, come on. We must go.

904
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,811
- Excuse me, you're not supposed to use the cell.
- Thank you. Thank you.

905
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:02,796
- We gotta' go.
- Hold on, a second.

906
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:04,834
Luke is such an asshole. He set me up.

907
00:48:04,941 --> 00:48:06,631
This isn't the producer's house.

908
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:09,514
Some frat party, they want me to strip.. and..

909
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:12,427
- You know what, I'm not gonna' do it anymore.. I just..
- Calm down..

910
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:15,240
Oh God they're gonna break down the door, Andy please!

911
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,745
Hello? Vanessa, are you o..?

912
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,745
Vanessa?! Hello..?

913
00:48:16,844 --> 00:48:19,047
- Andy, we gotta go, bud.
- Shit. Shit.

914
00:48:20,971 --> 00:48:22,825
- I gotta' go.
- No.

915
00:48:22,923 --> 00:48:24,231
- Yes, yes, I gotta' go.
- What are you talkin' about?

916
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,980
- Vanessa is in real trouble.
- Vanessa got plenty of other fuck buddies that she can call.

917
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:29,537
You get on the plane,
you get one the plane. You cover, you know the whole thing.

918
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:32,227
- You know what, I'm just gonna count to three ...
- This is a real emergency.

919
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,704
One ..

920
00:48:33,802 --> 00:48:35,078
- Two..
- I'm sorry, Jerry, I gotta go.

921
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,388
three..

922
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:38,656
four..

923
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:41,054
Urgh, fuck!

924
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,469
- Yeah?
- Hey, how are you?

925
00:48:46,568 --> 00:48:49,437
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm here for the party, man.

926
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:53,412
- Hey, hey, where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the show, buddy.

927
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,926
Ralph.

928
00:48:57,031 --> 00:48:59,616
This guy says he's part of the show.
Do you know anything about this?

929
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,987
Man, I don't know anything about that.

930
00:49:02,087 --> 00:49:03,745
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph..

931
00:49:03,846 --> 00:49:06,496
It's a surprise, buddy. You're gonna love it, trust me.

932
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,508
Wait until you see my cock.

933
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:10,752
You can tell your grandkids stories about it.
Seriously.

934
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:12,899
- Where's the girl?
- That way.

935
00:49:13,638 --> 00:49:14,914
What the hell..?

936
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:39,997
Vanessa, it's me. It's Andy.

937
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:47,200
Andy, these guys won't let me leave..
they're so pissed off..

938
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:49,185
they want me to strip and.. I'm not gonna do that..

939
00:49:49,282 --> 00:49:50,972
- Hey, hey. Give me a minute here, okay?!
- I'm just.. I'm not gonna' do that anymore

940
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,551
You know, I've been working so hard and
I've finally thought I earned something good.. you know?..

941
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,439
but guess what, this whole thing was a big "fuck you"

942
00:49:57,538 --> 00:50:00,603
Calm down, calm down. Sshh. Look at me, look at me.

943
00:50:00,705 --> 00:50:03,192
Breathe, alright? Breathe.

944
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:09,849
- I'm here now.
- Okay.

945
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:11,446
What does that mean?

946
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,268
I don't know.

947
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,453
Who wants to see a show?

948
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,290
Who wants to see a show, huh?

949
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:26,746
Good. Enough of that.

950
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:28,984
Alright, I see a lot of guys in this room..

951
00:50:29,086 --> 00:50:31,387
who needs to get laid, am I right?!

952
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,612
- Ernie. Ernie.
- Okay, here's what I need you guys to do..

953
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:38,610
is to form a semi-circle
right here in the middle of the room..

954
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:41,563
with a clear path right thru' the middle.

955
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:45,554
Ralph, Ralph! When I give you the que
I need you to turn off the lights.

956
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:49,139
But wait, how are we gonna' see anything?

957
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:53,239
It's glow-in-the-dark-pussy!!!

958
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:57,368
That's exactly what it is! That's right.

959
00:50:58,619 --> 00:50:59,480
It's me.

960
00:51:00,442 --> 00:51:02,132
- Ready?
- What do we do?

961
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,712
You stay right behind me.

962
00:51:07,578 --> 00:51:10,261
Yea! Alright, alright!

963
00:51:10,361 --> 00:51:12,368
Ralph, turn off the lights!

964
00:51:14,617 --> 00:51:15,380
Ralph.

965
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:26,095
Oh.. yeah!

966
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:30,551
What happening, guys?

967
00:51:30,648 --> 00:51:32,502
Where's the music?!

968
00:53:06,093 --> 00:53:07,467
Get in the car. Get in the car!

969
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:13,320
Assholes!

970
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:33,541
Tiffany?

971
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,406
Left.

972
00:53:37,226 --> 00:53:38,502
Bedroom?

973
00:53:38,602 --> 00:53:39,583
Too far!

974
00:54:20,998 --> 00:54:24,096
Krav Maga, the Israeli martial art.

975
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:24,960
What?

976
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,518
Shalom, motherfucker.

977
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,106
Good morning, sunshine.

978
00:54:31,332 --> 00:54:34,179
I have a shotgun pointed at your balls, right now.

979
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:35,617
I know that I messed up..

980
00:54:35,716 --> 00:54:38,650
real bad, but if
anyone could've pitched 'em..

981
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:40,512
I mean, you killed it, right?

982
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:43,994
You suck.

983
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:46,365
Jerry, you're killing me here. Come on.

984
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:49,150
- Why didn't the balls get on the plane?
- What?

985
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,908
Bloom kept yelling that, "Why didn't the Balls get on the plane?"

986
00:54:51,011 --> 00:54:53,628
We can't do this without the balls
in the operation. The plane never even took off, man.

987
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,355
It took all my charm
to save the account.

988
00:54:56,514 --> 00:54:57,375
We still have a shot.

989
00:54:57,474 --> 00:55:00,768
If, we are to stay
friends, and if, we're gonna stay a team..

990
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,905
and somehow
pull off this last chance pitch.

991
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,856
- You gotta' make me a couple promises.
- Anything.

992
00:55:05,953 --> 00:55:09,051
- We have two days until the old man comes down here to hear this pitch.
- He's comin'.. He's coming here?

993
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:11,999
Dinki Donuts, my friend. Dinki Donuts.

994
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,686
I need you to live and breathe
Dinki Donuts..

995
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:15,417
I need your complete focus and dedication..

996
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,137
so that we can redeem ourselves and get this
account back. Say it with me..

997
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,956
- Dinki Donuts.
- Dinki Donuts, yes, Alright I get it.

998
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:23,956
That's done.. done. What else? What's the next thing?

999
00:55:24,095 --> 00:55:26,483
The freaks.
I want them out of your life.

1000
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:31,607
- Andy?
- I.. pinky swear.

1001
00:55:32,478 --> 00:55:35,325
Well.. That includes firing Relish the second we step foot on the office today.

1002
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:37,524
This needs Cumin.

1003
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:41,532
Cumin.

1004
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,490
Knock, knock. Heh, sorry.

1005
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:48,214
Hey, friend. Andy,
can I talk to you for a second?

1006
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:49,559
Okay, thank you.

1007
00:55:54,204 --> 00:55:56,342
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Yea, I need to talk to you too, Donny. Please, let me go first..

1008
00:55:56,443 --> 00:55:58,744
Vanessa told us what happened last night. Okay?

1009
00:55:58,908 --> 00:56:00,947
There was a big blow up at the
meeting. Lots of drama.

1010
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:03,985
Two factions formed, okay?
Pro-and anti-Andy.

1011
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:05,529
Now..

1012
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:08,441
Couple people.. Tiffany, Franny.. they want you out..

1013
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:12,050
me and Ramon are lobbying for some sort of, a probation period..

1014
00:56:12,154 --> 00:56:14,771
in which.. Herman thinks it's gonna blow over in a couple of weeks.

1015
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:16,051
- That's good.
- But in the meantime..

1016
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:18,803
good news: he's agreed to work with you one on one.

1017
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:20,846
What? No, no, no. I don't want that. No.

1018
00:56:20,953 --> 00:56:22,840
Tell him thank you for me, but I really am not interested. Okay?

1019
00:56:22,968 --> 00:56:24,909
- Tell him yourself.
- What does that mean?

1020
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:28,304
- How's you hanging, dude?
- Oh God, I work here.

1021
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:30,994
Herman this is where I work, I work here,
you cannot be here right now.

1022
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:32,662
To quote my first sponsor..

1023
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,410
"I'm not going anywhere, lard ass. Not without my friend."

1024
00:56:35,511 --> 00:56:37,615
I don't want you to help me. I really don't want you to help me. Please.

1025
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:39,027
Or you. No one. Really, yeah.

1026
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:41,330
- What do you want?
- What I want? To be honest with you?

1027
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:43,950
I want my
old life back. I just want my old life back.

1028
00:56:44,055 --> 00:56:47,698
- Yeah? Yea?
- Sorry, we can't let that happen. No.

1029
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:48,525
- Why?
- Why?

1030
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:50,573
You are one of the greatest people I've ever met in my life.

1031
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:52,019
- Okay, good.
- If it weren't for this job..

1032
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,637
I'd be lying in the gutter,
making maps of Hawaii on my stomach.

1033
00:56:54,742 --> 00:56:56,749
You've helped us all, Andy.

1034
00:56:56,854 --> 00:56:58,958
We need you, the group needs you.

1035
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:01,744
- You're the greatest person in the world.
- Can we.. can we just discuss this please?

1036
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,751
Oh.. God. Oh my God, that hurts so much.

1037
00:57:04,981 --> 00:57:06,736
Hey, what did you want to talk with me about?

1038
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:12,274
Oh.. yeah! You suck!

1039
00:57:12,372 --> 00:57:14,859
You're getting beat by a girl. You suck!

1040
00:57:20,243 --> 00:57:21,224
Hi!

1041
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:23,953
- Hey, Andy.
- Andy, hey.

1042
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,773
What's up, man? Grab the guitar, we need the rhytm.

1043
00:57:25,874 --> 00:57:27,368
Vanessa, what are you doing here?

1044
00:57:27,506 --> 00:57:29,677
- Hang on, just give me a sec.
- Go, go.

1045
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:33,614
Nice!

1046
00:57:36,337 --> 00:57:40,427
I called to talk to you, Jerry answered the phone,
he invited me over, said you'll be right back.

1047
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:41,739
Oh, that's nice.

1048
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,457
I just came here to tell you that it's my
my problem, it's not yours..

1049
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,803
you know people loves you in the group..

1050
00:57:45,904 --> 00:57:47,813
and it would be selfish of me to deny that.

1051
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,254
After what happened, the other night..

1052
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,845
I kinda' got it out of my system ..

1053
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:54,187
you know this.. the steam has been released. So to speak.

1054
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:57,864
I'm happy to say Andy, that I've lost my attraction to you.

1055
00:57:57,967 --> 00:57:59,657
I'm not attracted to you anymore.

1056
00:57:59,759 --> 00:58:02,955
Oh, and your friend.. he's so great.

1057
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:05,061
I mean, you are right, great guy.

1058
00:58:06,286 --> 00:58:07,747
I've got a great idea. Great idea.

1059
00:58:07,886 --> 00:58:10,187
- Let's go to the warehouse for some brunch.
- I love the warehouse.

1060
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:11,334
Oh, it's a date!

1061
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:15,272
- What?
- "I'm finished with this perverts..

1062
00:58:15,374 --> 00:58:16,835
they are out of my life. You have my words. "

1063
00:58:16,941 --> 00:58:19,755
- Liar.
- You better not bring up your freakin' credo, you understand.

1064
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:21,543
- Hey, you coming too, Andy?
- Yeah.

1065
00:58:21,644 --> 00:58:22,920
Let's go!

1066
00:58:30,603 --> 00:58:33,155
- Hurm, oh my God. You should try this.
- Oh, yeah?

1067
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:36,648
Right?

1068
00:59:05,384 --> 00:59:06,627
You speak Spanish right, Andy?

1069
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,327
No.

1070
00:59:09,895 --> 00:59:12,644
God, Barcelona.
It feels like another lifetime ago.

1071
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,174
- Have you ever been to Spain?
- No.

1072
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:20,318
Oh my God, Andy, you have to go..

1073
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:22,396
The first time I fell in love, I was in Spain.

1074
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:23,330
Me too.

1075
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:25,147
- Yea?
- Yea.

1076
00:59:25,254 --> 00:59:27,741
- Did your story have a happy ending?
- No. Of course not, does yours?

1077
00:59:27,846 --> 00:59:29,056
She wanted to get married.

1078
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,899
Oh my God, is this the girl
that you were gonna marry ...

1079
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:34,525
and then she ended up sleeping with
the guy from the gym...?

1080
00:59:34,629 --> 00:59:35,970
That I was gonna marry?

1081
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,747
Urm.. Are you thinking of err...?

1082
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:46,082
- Am I talking out of school here?
- No, no ...

1083
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,474
You know what, I'm an open book.
My whole life is on speaker phone. Ask Andy.

1084
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:52,091
All of life's secrets I wear them
on my sleeve, look at that.

1085
00:59:52,195 --> 00:59:55,194
- What do you wanna know?
- God, I mean, how do you get over something like that?

1086
00:59:57,634 --> 01:00:00,830
Urm.. Look, I'm not gonna lie. When
I'm in a relationship...

1087
01:00:01,506 --> 01:00:02,814
I.. I lose myself. You know?

1088
01:00:02,914 --> 01:00:06,328
I can toward my personality to become the person
I think that the women wants me to be.

1089
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:08,156
It's a huge recipe for failure.

1090
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:11,769
And of course, Andy, you know he's
my friend and everything but ...

1091
01:00:11,873 --> 01:00:13,465
he doesn't understand.. he has no sympathy for that..

1092
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:16,089
with his one night stand and his conquest and stuffs...

1093
01:00:16,192 --> 01:00:19,225
He actually thinks I'm spineless, but you know what..

1094
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:21,782
- I'm a romantic.
- There's nothing wrong with that.

1095
01:00:21,888 --> 01:00:23,349
- Thank you. Want more Mimosa?
- Please.

1096
01:00:23,455 --> 01:00:26,869
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh hey!

1097
01:00:26,976 --> 01:00:29,528
Hey, look who it is. Eva and Inge, right?

1098
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:31,256
Oh hey, how're you doin'? Take care.

1099
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,725
We are on a layover from Frankfurt..

1100
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:35,448
we're going to Australia.

1101
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:38,136
We love it at the down under. It's really good.

1102
01:00:38,238 --> 01:00:39,165
Sounds really good.

1103
01:00:40,254 --> 01:00:41,912
- This is a friend of ours, Vanessa.
- Hello.

1104
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:45,625
Hello. You know we really love Jerry, he is the best.

1105
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:48,692
- You remember Andy, right?
- How could I forget.

1106
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:51,413
Mr. "I don't care about you at all".

1107
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:53,556
Let me give you a little warning. Girl to girl.

1108
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,968
He says one things at dinner...

1109
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:57,654
but then it turns into a different story when
he gets into the bedroom.

1110
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:05,745
He has to know how humiliated I was.

1111
01:01:05,851 --> 01:01:07,890
You are scum. Scum!

1112
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:15,608
Ally, you get these stuffs into the easels
left, center, right.

1113
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:16,687
Thank you.

1114
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,265
What are you doing?

1115
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:22,995
Vanessa is funny, man.

1116
01:01:23,098 --> 01:01:24,853
Funny and hot, when you ever see that combination?

1117
01:01:26,713 --> 01:01:27,508
Is that really Vanessa?

1118
01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:30,063
I swear to God if you pull that
Don Juan shit with her...

1119
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:31,150
Relax...

1120
01:01:31,256 --> 01:01:34,037
she just sent me a photo of
this great place in Barcelona...

1121
01:01:34,136 --> 01:01:35,150
where all of the students used to hang out.

1122
01:01:35,288 --> 01:01:37,109
- You've never even been to Spain.
- I know.

1123
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:39,600
Hey guys, come on, let's go. Lets' rock!

1124
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:41,842
Make it good. Let's go!

1125
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:47,636
Robots have always been
associated with the future, right?

1126
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:48,912
A bright future.

1127
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:51,599
And what's cools is that these
robots, are also "retro" looking...

1128
01:01:51,703 --> 01:01:53,775
So it's futuristic and nostalgic at the same time.

1129
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:55,405
It's comfort food for the eyes.

1130
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,509
I give you Dinki Donuts new logo.

1131
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:02,163
Iconic, graphic, arresting.

1132
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:03,668
What do you think, Dad?

1133
01:02:04,661 --> 01:02:06,668
Dinki Donuts are
robot fuels.

1134
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,365
They power these lean mean machines right here.

1135
01:02:08,469 --> 01:02:09,396
Have you ever seen a fat robot?

1136
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:10,419
No.

1137
01:02:10,516 --> 01:02:12,523
Fat robot? You just don't see that. Doesn't happen.

1138
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,994
- What do you think, Pop?
- I love it.

1139
01:02:15,124 --> 01:02:16,334
- Question.
- Yes?

1140
01:02:16,436 --> 01:02:19,632
Is it sexy enough for the 18-49s?

1141
01:02:19,732 --> 01:02:22,284
- A valid question.
- Is it sexy enough?

1142
01:02:22,387 --> 01:02:25,103
Are you kidding? This robot
couldn't be sexier.

1143
01:02:25,235 --> 01:02:27,122
Do you know what I'm sayin'?

1144
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:30,447
I do that because we can
take these logo and these robot...

1145
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:31,921
and put 'em on a bunch of products...

1146
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:33,677
that you normally wouldn't be able
sell in the store.

1147
01:02:33,778 --> 01:02:36,777
So you can get your donut counter, you got a
T-shirt, you got err.. you know, a keychain...

1148
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:40,143
- I'm sorry, gentlemen..
- Andy, Andy, stay with the product.

1149
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:42,827
Just one moment, I'll be right back.
Thank you very much.

1150
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:47,759
Err.. T-shirts, I was sayin'...

1151
01:02:49,872 --> 01:02:51,726
What is it Donny? This better be huge.

1152
01:02:51,825 --> 01:02:54,726
Don, whatever it is, it's gotta wait,
it's gotta wait. I'm sorry..

1153
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:56,490
I'm tense.

1154
01:02:56,624 --> 01:02:58,990
I'm a volcano and I'm about to erupt.

1155
01:02:59,088 --> 01:03:01,705
I need you to bottle it up. Okay, alright?

1156
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:04,327
And you can let it out, all over, in an hour.

1157
01:03:04,431 --> 01:03:05,707
Alright? Good, we cool?

1158
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:11,525
I got the CCPJ and the CPO. Put Greenberg's mail in Greenfield's cubby and
I put the DHL slip in the Fedex overnight and the airborne guy picked it up.

1159
01:03:11,727 --> 01:03:17,413
Listen. Listen to me. I am trying to save my career in there.
You understand what I'm talkin' about..

1160
01:03:17,613 --> 01:03:19,849
I need you to take in some deep breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

1161
01:03:19,949 --> 01:03:21,377
Good, good, good.

1162
01:03:21,549 --> 01:03:24,134
Listen, we can talk about this in one hour. Alright?

1163
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:26,625
Don't do anything crazy. Alright?

1164
01:03:28,845 --> 01:03:30,405
Let me talk to you about the box for a second.

1165
01:03:30,508 --> 01:03:31,849
The box is not just a doughnut box but..

1166
01:03:31,948 --> 01:03:34,151
it's also, the robot's head.

1167
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:36,324
- Hello.
- Sorry about that. I'm back!

1168
01:03:36,428 --> 01:03:38,762
- Where are we?
- Err, I was just doing the box..

1169
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:42,274
- And we're gonna go to phase 2.
- Yes, phase 2, that's very.. very exciting.

1170
01:03:42,379 --> 01:03:45,575
That's where we began to introduce the doughnuts
and the robots themselves as movie stars ...

1171
01:03:45,675 --> 01:03:47,235
by doing a series of movie posters spoofs...

1172
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:48,833
like this one from "The Shawshanks Redemption"...

1173
01:03:48,938 --> 01:03:51,490
where we had the doughnuts raining down on the muscular robot.

1174
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:53,447
Owh, that's very clever.

1175
01:03:53,546 --> 01:03:54,756
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1176
01:03:54,858 --> 01:03:56,930
And the first one we're going to be ... starting with erm..

1177
01:03:57,065 --> 01:03:59,748
- Call Security!
- ... erm.. "The Matrix" ...

1178
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:01,506
That's disgusting! What are you doing?!

1179
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:04,161
"The Matrix". We all know, imagine the robot ...

1180
01:04:04,265 --> 01:04:06,468
- he's down like this and doughnuts ...
- I'm so sorry.

1181
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:09,601
Time me, time me. I'll be right
back, gentlemen.

1182
01:04:09,704 --> 01:04:10,881
Nothing to worry about.

1183
01:04:13,992 --> 01:04:15,300
Be right back!

1184
01:04:16,071 --> 01:04:17,052
"The Godfather."

1185
01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:21,926
Donny.

1186
01:04:27,526 --> 01:04:28,932
Jesus Donny, you're gonna get me fired.

1187
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,779
- Holy fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

1188
01:04:32,646 --> 01:04:34,882
Oh, God. This is strike 3.

1189
01:04:34,982 --> 01:04:37,599
I'm going to jail for a real long time, Andy.

1190
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:40,513
Is that liquid..?

1191
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:43,776
Yeah, I used "liquid paper"
because I know it was a mistake.

1192
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:45,951
Alright, Alright!..

1193
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,711
first of all, will you pull your pants up, please!

1194
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:49,437
I can't talk to you with your pants down. Alright?

1195
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,409
And let's just clean this up.. Alright?

1196
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,147
I'm so sorry.

1197
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:57,182
I didn't mean for it to happen like this.

1198
01:04:57,283 --> 01:04:58,591
Oh, shit!

1199
01:04:58,723 --> 01:04:59,453
What?

1200
01:04:59,555 --> 01:05:01,180
Right in there, in the copy room.

1201
01:05:01,283 --> 01:05:05,079
God.. fuck. Please man. Please. What do we do?
I don't want to go there.

1202
01:05:05,186 --> 01:05:08,534
Just get.. get out, run, run! Go.

1203
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,585
- I'm so sorry.
- Run!

1204
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,393
Freeze! Let me see your hands!

1205
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:21,533
Once again, I bet on the wrong guy.

1206
01:05:21,632 --> 01:05:24,249
What is wrong with me?

1207
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:26,838
I don't know. You deserve better.

1208
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,211
- I just...
- What?

1209
01:05:29,312 --> 01:05:31,133
He was doing better, wasn't he?

1210
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,945
Yea, it's a disease, Vanessa.

1211
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:35,671
It's very sad.

1212
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:37,716
I'm just glad that I can be here for ya'.

1213
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:44,567
Oh. Sorry to make you wait
while I do my Cardio.

1214
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,230
I am addicted.

1215
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:48,919
Oh, sweaty mcleaty. More Merlot?

1216
01:05:49,182 --> 01:05:50,294
Yea.

1217
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:52,375
I hope I don't stink too bad for ya'.

1218
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,277
Wow.

1219
01:05:56,477 --> 01:05:58,135
I'm gonna make you the best dinner on the planet.

1220
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:00,724
- You like penne?
- Yeah.

1221
01:06:03,612 --> 01:06:04,855
Hand on one second.

1222
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,030
Hello?

1223
01:06:11,803 --> 01:06:13,526
Jerry, it's me.

1224
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:17,680
- We got fired today.
- Look, I need you to come down and take...

1225
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:19,608
- Fired.
- Jerry?

1226
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:45,365
Oh, Vanessa.

1227
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:46,445
No, this is not Vanessa.

1228
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:50,199
- No, Jerry!
- What am I supposed to do, Andy?

1229
01:06:50,295 --> 01:06:51,342
You never learn.

1230
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:53,846
I really feel like I'm enabling you.

1231
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:56,885
Let me ask you a question.
Why did throw everything we worked for..

1232
01:06:56,983 --> 01:06:58,738
down the toilet just to save some
jerk-off you don't even know?

1233
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:03,982
I'll come get you in the morning.

1234
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:05,973
No, Jerry. I need you to come..

1235
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,616
God, no!

1236
01:07:12,981 --> 01:07:15,533
I got these incredible truffles ...

1237
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:17,938
from a guy in Tuscany who went on a
truffle hunt..

1238
01:07:18,036 --> 01:07:20,272
they follow pigs around..

1239
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:22,924
and the pigs smell
truffles underground...

1240
01:07:23,028 --> 01:07:24,434
at the base of these oak trees.

1241
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:26,768
I mean, they're really-really expensive but...

1242
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:30,028
Oh, my God. Smell that.

1243
01:07:31,539 --> 01:07:33,905
Just shave a little of them on top of
pasta, it's magic.

1244
01:07:34,003 --> 01:07:35,213
That sounds so good.

1245
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:38,063
Oh no, it's not good. It's better than sex.

1246
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,256
So do you think we should call Andy
to make sure he's okay?

1247
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:46,825
That was actually Andy that called earlier.
I didn't want to upset you.

1248
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:49,132
He's got to spend the night in jail.
They're not letting him out.

1249
01:07:50,193 --> 01:07:52,297
Oh my God. That's awful.

1250
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,921
Yea, yeah, but hopefully this is rock bottom.

1251
01:07:56,528 --> 01:07:58,251
He's gonna be stronger for this.

1252
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:06,437
I can't tell you how much
this means to me...

1253
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:10,470
what you did, and.. and I want you to know
that I'm gonna' get my shit together...

1254
01:08:10,575 --> 01:08:12,746
from now on,
I keeping it in my pants.

1255
01:08:12,846 --> 01:08:14,406
- Good.
- It's a promise.

1256
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:17,160
Oh my God. She's angry.

1257
01:08:18,126 --> 01:08:20,678
Listen, whatever you need,
in the middle of the night...

1258
01:08:20,782 --> 01:08:22,756
I'm highest peak, you pick up the phone...

1259
01:08:22,862 --> 01:08:24,290
- Donny...
- Yea..

1260
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:27,717
Can you just.. drive me home?

1261
01:08:27,821 --> 01:08:29,064
I don't drive.

1262
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:30,852
You know that.

1263
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:35,908
No. I did not know that.

1264
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:37,800
Should we call somebody?

1265
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:40,391
Okay, this is me.

1266
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:45,698
Okay, great. Thanks for the ride.

1267
01:08:45,803 --> 01:08:48,224
Hey, I guess I see you guys at the group or...

1268
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:52,005
You're going in the wrong direction.

1269
01:08:52,106 --> 01:08:53,927
- We're goin' to my place.
- Is Vanessa there?

1270
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,126
Oh God.

1271
01:08:56,235 --> 01:08:56,998
Vanessa?

1272
01:08:57,322 --> 01:08:58,401
Vanessa?

1273
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:01,576
Where is she?

1274
01:09:03,914 --> 01:09:04,993
She's right here.

1275
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:12,518
Right?

1276
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:15,681
Yea, those truffles are incredible.

1277
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,093
I told you.

1278
01:09:17,192 --> 01:09:19,493
How did you learn to cook like that?

1279
01:09:21,447 --> 01:09:22,559
Well..

1280
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:26,046
when my fiancee left...

1281
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,933
the food network was my only friend.

1282
01:09:30,758 --> 01:09:32,132
You feeling any better?

1283
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:37,530
I don't know if I'm better but, drunker for sure.

1284
01:09:37,638 --> 01:09:39,677
Well I know how to make you feel better.

1285
01:09:41,286 --> 01:09:42,398
You just gotta trust me.

1286
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:45,443
You do trust me? Dont ya?

1287
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:49,597
I don't know.

1288
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,226
Come on. You can trust me.

1289
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:53,633
I'm certified in Reflexology.

1290
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,441
I need you to sit up here. Okay?

1291
01:09:59,811 --> 01:10:00,955
Come on.

1292
01:10:04,003 --> 01:10:05,311
Sit up here.

1293
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:13,211
I don't know if you like it but..

1294
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:17,310
I love giving a good foot massage.

1295
01:10:18,753 --> 01:10:21,622
Wait, hold.. slow down for a second..

1296
01:10:55,038 --> 01:10:56,663
Oh, you're in for a treat tonight.

1297
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:03,957
Yes, that's right.

1298
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,328
I haven't eaten for 100 days and..

1299
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:09,362
Momma is hungry. Hehe.

1300
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,430
You're my little banana sundae...

1301
01:11:13,532 --> 01:11:14,808
that right, that's it..

1302
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,324
there we go, that's it!..

1303
01:11:18,427 --> 01:11:19,637
Oh~ Squirm..

1304
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:21,265
there we go...

1305
01:11:21,371 --> 01:11:23,378
that we go and a pupu.

1306
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:25,304
The pupu, the pupu.

1307
01:11:25,403 --> 01:11:27,890
Just a minute. Want some
chocolate in your vanilla?

1308
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:30,575
You want some chocolate in your vanilla?

1309
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:38,606
Super Bowl.

1310
01:11:38,713 --> 01:11:41,712
Here we go, now. Here we go, now.

1311
01:11:41,817 --> 01:11:44,533
Here we go, now. Here we go, now.

1312
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,338
Yes, 15...

1313
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,806
75... 43...

1314
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:51,831
Hut! Hut!

1315
01:11:51,928 --> 01:11:57,653
Yes, as a retuércete
lizard in a skillet. And a 100 day!

1316
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:00,558
Oh.. my.. God!

1317
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:04,341
Get off of me, you bastard.

1318
01:12:04,438 --> 01:12:06,542
He came here lookin' for you ...

1319
01:12:06,647 --> 01:12:07,791
and when he couldn't find you ...

1320
01:12:07,894 --> 01:12:09,715
he just ravaged me ...

1321
01:12:09,814 --> 01:12:11,952
then he made me put on this outfit...

1322
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:14,924
That is not what happen. At all!

1323
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,207
Get out of here, Andy.

1324
01:12:16,309 --> 01:12:18,218
She attacked me. Alright?

1325
01:12:18,325 --> 01:12:19,666
You gotta believe me.

1326
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:21,968
I would never do
anything to hurt you, come on you know that.

1327
01:12:22,164 --> 01:12:24,171
Really? Really?!

1328
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,893
Is that why you told
Jerry all about me?

1329
01:12:26,996 --> 01:12:28,621
Taught him how to get me in bed?

1330
01:12:29,716 --> 01:12:30,414
What happened?

1331
01:12:32,596 --> 01:12:34,057
He's a great lay.

1332
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:35,887
Is it what you want to hear?

1333
01:12:39,123 --> 01:12:41,937
No. Vanessa, please...

1334
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:46,695
Get out of here.

1335
01:12:46,802 --> 01:12:48,012
Get out of here.

1336
01:12:48,146 --> 01:12:49,738
Get out of my life.

1337
01:12:49,874 --> 01:12:52,721
I never wanna see you again. Do you hear me?

1338
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:53,930
Go!

1339
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:21,224
You slept with her?

1340
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:23,811
Jesus, what, they locked you up at "Ben & Jerry"?

1341
01:13:23,918 --> 01:13:25,673
I can't fucking believe you!

1342
01:13:25,774 --> 01:13:27,300
And I can't fucking believe you.

1343
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,858
I mean every time I have to fix your fucking mess.

1344
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:31,623
Same thing I had to do with Cynthia.

1345
01:13:33,293 --> 01:13:34,819
Cynthia?

1346
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:36,583
What.. what do you mean fix? What does that mean?

1347
01:13:36,685 --> 01:13:37,546
What do you think it means?

1348
01:13:37,644 --> 01:13:38,952
She was gonna move you to Boston,
break up the team...

1349
01:13:39,052 --> 01:13:40,480
and I was going to allow that to happens? No way!

1350
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,324
You're the guy from the gym?

1351
01:13:45,484 --> 01:13:47,174
You're just now figuring this out?

1352
01:13:49,996 --> 01:13:51,490
Get out of my life!

1353
01:14:01,931 --> 01:14:03,491
I know...

1354
01:14:04,266 --> 01:14:05,574
we need furniture.

1355
01:14:10,314 --> 01:14:11,491
That's good.

1356
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:17,566
Stay away!

1357
01:14:17,673 --> 01:14:20,356
Jesus, Herman, you scared the shit out of me.

1358
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,008
She's back with Luke,
she's stripping full time in Jumbo's ...

1359
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:24,867
- And it's your fault.
- You people are unbelievable.. you don't want me around..

1360
01:14:24,968 --> 01:14:26,374
but you won't leave me alone.

1361
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,291
Well you had other options, motherfucker.

1362
01:14:28,392 --> 01:14:30,301
You could have come to the Rock
instead of jerking off...

1363
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:32,261
going to the jail, sell out Vanessa..

1364
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:33,700
and  then "desserting" Tiffany.

1365
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:35,423
" Dessert " Tiffany?

1366
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:37,501
Was it "Chocolate? "Nuts?

1367
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:41,313
Alright, alright, "desserting", yeah!

1368
01:14:41,414 --> 01:14:43,202
- That's right, you know it, motherfucker.
- I get it.

1369
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:45,057
Stay away.

1370
01:14:47,109 --> 01:14:48,319
Jesus, Herman!

1371
01:14:52,964 --> 01:14:53,912
Jerry?

1372
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,535
Jerry?

1373
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:24,608
[ iSight, iSaw, iConquered ]

1374
01:15:29,953 --> 01:15:30,880
Oh no.

1375
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,595
Just a minute, just a minute.

1376
01:16:04,733 --> 01:16:07,514
- No, no, no, I'm here for you.
- I don't want this anymore.

1377
01:16:07,613 --> 01:16:09,500
- What?
- I can't, I can't do it.

1378
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:11,418
- I changed my mind. Okay?
- I know, I know. Andy told me.

1379
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:14,266
- Don't worry.
- Andy told you what?

1380
01:16:14,364 --> 01:16:17,592
- What Andy told you?
- Just, you know what we call "triggers"..

1381
01:16:17,692 --> 01:16:19,284
- Things that gets you on.
- Oh my God.

1382
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:21,297
You know, don't worry about it,
I don't think there's anything wrong with you.

1383
01:16:21,404 --> 01:16:23,738
- You're disgusting.
- I'm disgusting?

1384
01:16:23,836 --> 01:16:25,745
- I'm just trying to protect my friend.
- Protect him?

1385
01:16:25,851 --> 01:16:27,574
Yes he needs to know what kind of person you really are.

1386
01:16:27,675 --> 01:16:29,365
You're wasting his time, you know that?

1387
01:16:29,466 --> 01:16:31,986
- I don't want you to hurt him.
- What kind of person are you? Hurt him?

1388
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:36,693
How could I hurt him? I love him, you asshole!

1389
01:17:11,446 --> 01:17:13,038
Fuck off.

1390
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,004
- You okay, Vanessa?
- Can you just hand me my stuffs please.

1391
01:17:19,285 --> 01:17:20,779
- Call me if you need me.
- Thanks.

1392
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:24,141
- Where do you think you're going?
- I just quit, genius.

1393
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:27,146
Baby, we need the money.
How many times we're gonna go through this?

1394
01:17:28,309 --> 01:17:29,999
This will be the last time.

1395
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,528
- Whoo.. whoo..
- Stop it!

1396
01:17:31,668 --> 01:17:33,936
- Get your ass, back on that stage.
- Just let me go. Okay? Luke?

1397
01:17:34,036 --> 01:17:36,272
- Hey, hey, hey Vanessa, come on..
- Andy, get out of here.

1398
01:17:36,372 --> 01:17:38,706
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Stop. Andy, go.

1399
01:17:38,804 --> 01:17:42,000
- I thought said I don't want to see you again.
- Hands off her, asshat.

1400
01:17:43,891 --> 01:17:45,417
Oh my God.

1401
01:17:45,523 --> 01:17:46,570
Get up!

1402
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,987
Damn, it!

1403
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:06,728
Vanessa!

1404
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,427
He came on to my shit.

1405
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:51,938
And I went on a hundred days...
more than a hundred days..

1406
01:18:52,044 --> 01:18:53,931
without any action, Burton.

1407
01:18:54,028 --> 01:18:56,482
But it was like there's a hurricane
went off in my brain.

1408
01:18:56,587 --> 01:18:58,441
There was cows and they were flying and shit..

1409
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,230
there was Dorothy and there was a lot of shit..

1410
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:04,455
I was vulnerable...

1411
01:19:04,555 --> 01:19:06,594
and he took advantage of me.

1412
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:08,519
Well, Tiffany welcome back.

1413
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:11,617
Think of this as your first day.

1414
01:19:11,722 --> 01:19:14,755
Are you willing to walk down that road with all of us?

1415
01:19:15,466 --> 01:19:17,440
- Just say "Yes I am."
- Yes, I am.

1416
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,711
I'm very proud of you.

1417
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:22,725
Can we help you?

1418
01:19:25,096 --> 01:19:26,851
Sorry to interrupt.

1419
01:19:28,392 --> 01:19:31,108
Err, Vanessa, can I talk to
you for a second outside, please?

1420
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:33,596
Why don't you tell us what
you're gonna tell Vanessa?

1421
01:19:33,704 --> 01:19:35,132
This is a no secrets zone.

1422
01:19:36,584 --> 01:19:37,990
I'd really rather talk in private.

1423
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:40,388
Ya, I know big boy, but you don't have an option.

1424
01:19:41,607 --> 01:19:42,435
Fine. Fine.

1425
01:19:43,366 --> 01:19:44,794
I'll just say it and go.

1426
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:50,436
I'm a liar. Okay?

1427
01:19:50,533 --> 01:19:52,387
I lied to you.

1428
01:19:52,486 --> 01:19:54,787
And to Burton, and then to Rock...

1429
01:19:54,885 --> 01:19:57,023
Donny, Tiffany, Franny...

1430
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:01,281
- Ramon.
- Yes, Ramon and to all the rest of you... yes..

1431
01:20:01,381 --> 01:20:03,388
but worst than that though, I lied to myself.

1432
01:20:05,188 --> 01:20:07,292
I err.. I got problems. Alright?

1433
01:20:07,396 --> 01:20:09,500
Believe me. But...

1434
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:10,945
I don't have your problem.

1435
01:20:11,524 --> 01:20:12,767
I lied about that too.

1436
01:20:13,699 --> 01:20:16,000
I pretended to be a sex addict..

1437
01:20:16,099 --> 01:20:17,953
because I wanted to get close to someone..

1438
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:20,832
who I fell in love with the second that I first saw her.

1439
01:20:22,018 --> 01:20:23,446
You, Vanessa.

1440
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:27,964
If I had just been honest
with you from the beginning..

1441
01:20:28,066 --> 01:20:30,269
I really think that you would have liked me..

1442
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:31,449
for me.

1443
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:35,320
And that's it.

1444
01:20:36,897 --> 01:20:38,009
I said it.

1445
01:20:41,376 --> 01:20:42,324
Andy.

1446
01:20:44,096 --> 01:20:48,350
For months, I've been talking about
how ready I am to meet a decent guy.

1447
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:51,357
But since I have this problem..

1448
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:55,067
I wouldn't recognize a decent guy
if he was right in front of me.

1449
01:20:57,855 --> 01:20:59,927
Well, I'm looking right at you, Andy.

1450
01:21:00,703 --> 01:21:01,596
I am.

1451
01:21:02,111 --> 01:21:04,150
And I wanna believe you..

1452
01:21:04,254 --> 01:21:05,431
so much.

1453
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:09,299
But I don't even know who you are.

1454
01:21:12,478 --> 01:21:13,525
I know who he is.

1455
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:16,380
He is a man, that
when I was down...

1456
01:21:16,476 --> 01:21:19,159
and I was about to sodomize a
hooker in my van ...

1457
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,404
and he saved me.

1458
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,230
That's that man.

1459
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,695
Ya, I know that man.

1460
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:28,592
That man there got fired and went
to jail for me ...

1461
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:29,560
that man.

1462
01:21:33,307 --> 01:21:36,208
I attacked him. Not the other way around.

1463
01:21:36,315 --> 01:21:38,998
Fuck, you all know I'm sick.

1464
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:40,113
That's why we're here.

1465
01:21:40,218 --> 01:21:42,159
Now, that is sweet , attagurl.

1466
01:21:42,266 --> 01:21:43,826
- Can hardly believe it.
- Big surprise.

1467
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,304
That is quite a resume, young man.

1468
01:21:47,097 --> 01:21:49,333
You know, like I said, I do anything to fit in.

1469
01:21:51,993 --> 01:21:54,447
But you're right, you don't
know me at all.

1470
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:57,397
So what about we just start over?

1471
01:21:59,032 --> 01:21:59,980
My name is Andy.

1472
01:22:00,088 --> 01:22:02,324
- Hi, Andy.
- No..

1473
01:22:02,808 --> 01:22:04,531
this time without you guys.

1474
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,388
Hi.

1475
01:22:11,543 --> 01:22:13,069
I'm Andy.

1476
01:22:15,095 --> 01:22:16,850
Girl, don't miss out.

1477
01:22:19,382 --> 01:22:20,526
Go.

1478
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:30,191
Vanessa.

1479
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,066
You're not gonna shake my hand?

1480
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:38,190
I'm not gonna touch you for the next hundred days.

1481
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:41,291
Oww, celibacy pledge.

1482
01:22:41,395 --> 01:22:42,769
How romantic is that.

1483
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:45,233
No touching for a hundred days. That's so damn stupid.

1484
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:46,638
It's appropriate.

1485
01:22:47,827 --> 01:22:48,874
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1486
01:22:49,971 --> 01:22:52,239
- One hundred days?
- Can you handle that?

1487
01:22:54,738 --> 01:22:55,915
Yeah.

1488
01:22:59,922 --> 01:23:01,776
My name is Jerry, I'm a sex addict.

1489
01:23:01,874 --> 01:23:04,142
- Jerry, what are you doing?
- I know, I gotta do this, I gotta do this.

1490
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:06,793
Andy is not the villain here, I am. I am.

1491
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:08,272
- What?
- Yeah, oh yeah.

1492
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:10,758
We were best friends and what did I do,
I slept with his fiancee ...

1493
01:23:10,865 --> 01:23:11,879
six weeks before the wedding.

1494
01:23:11,985 --> 01:23:13,675
Six weeks!

1495
01:23:13,777 --> 01:23:16,111
- You don't have to do this.
- Hey. What's wrong with your face?

1496
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:17,800
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

1497
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:19,464
Listen, listen I'm just getting started.

1498
01:23:19,568 --> 01:23:22,469
And now he's fallen in love
this beautiful woman right here...

1499
01:23:22,575 --> 01:23:24,330
- And what did I do? What did I do?
- What did you do?

1500
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:25,739
- What?
- What did you do?

1501
01:23:25,871 --> 01:23:27,397
I tried to seduce her.

1502
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,212
Yea, yeah. I got problems. I got big problems.

1503
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:32,237
Hello, Turquoise.

1504
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:34,473
Oh my God. Oh my God!

1505
01:23:34,574 --> 01:23:37,028
See, he thought.. that..

1506
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:38,922
if he was more like me ...

1507
01:23:39,022 --> 01:23:40,036
that he would have better luck with you.

1508
01:23:40,142 --> 01:23:42,792
That's why he's been hanging out
will all you perverts.

1509
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:43,588
Come on.

1510
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:45,288
And all the sexual talks that
he's been saying..

1511
01:23:45,389 --> 01:23:47,723
all these crazy stories,
they're my stories.

1512
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:49,925
He got no game. He's got no game.

1513
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:51,490
Trust me. It was me.

1514
01:23:52,492 --> 01:23:53,986
You gotta believe him.

1515
01:24:00,172 --> 01:24:01,251
I do.

1516
01:24:02,987 --> 01:24:04,230
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1517
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,218
Are you the mayor of Pussy Town?

1518
01:24:06,315 --> 01:24:08,103
- You're my hero.
- Yeah.

1519
01:24:08,203 --> 01:24:10,210
- Yea, yea.
- Come on and sit down.

1520
01:24:12,554 --> 01:24:13,928
- Do you wanna...?
- Yes.

1521
01:24:14,026 --> 01:24:15,967
- I didn't catch your name when you err...
- I'm Jerry.

1522
01:24:16,074 --> 01:24:17,829
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hi.

1523
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:20,318
Alright, this is the place to purge.
Go ahead. Spit it out.

1524
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:22,759
- I've been chasing the beef since I was 10.
- Really?

1525
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:26,053
Yeah, for my bar mitzvah, my aunt
gave me a golden pen ...

1526
01:24:26,153 --> 01:24:27,876
- And a rimmer.
- Holy ma...

1527
01:24:27,977 --> 01:24:29,732
- Yea.
- That's amazing..

1528
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:32,418
Keep talking. Squeeze it out. Here we go.
