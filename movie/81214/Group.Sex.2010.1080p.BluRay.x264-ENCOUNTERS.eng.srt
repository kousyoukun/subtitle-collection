1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:01,827
I love women.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,897
But, like a lot.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,297
So much, I actually get kinda emotional
when I talk about this. I'm Sorry.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,074
I think it's because I have so much
respect for women.

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,010
I mean if women are reigning the world,
how much better off would we be?

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,810
I'm kinda like the biggest feminist there is..

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,753
anyway when I'm holding a woman and
I got one hand behind the back of her neck..

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,621
and two fingers up inside her
and I'm  just tweaking that G-spot ..

9
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,489
and I'm playing like a Stradivarius

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,688
and I watch her writhe in ectasy

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,027
I mean that's like a religious experience

12
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,756
and I'm not gonna lie to ya.
I don't think ...

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,804
Picasso or Da Vinci has done anything more
inspired than I do when I'm with a woman.

14
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,396
In my own small way, I've made a contribution ...

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,408
I've made the world.. just..

16
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,436
a little bit better.

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,806
I guess ...

18
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,978
I exist ...

19
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,551
to please women.

20
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,819
That's it.

21
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,513
Thank you, Rachel.

22
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,985
That was impressive.

23
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,685
Very.

24
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,824
It almost sound like you believe what you're saying.

25
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,629
Almost, ja.

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,727
Okay. You know what,
I'm about to feel insulted here..

27
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,465
Not only I believe what I'm saying..

28
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,972
but what you just heard, that's my credo.

29
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,336
Pleasing woman, is your credo?

30
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,606
It is. It's my credo! Tell 'em , Andy.

31
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,386
Yes, yes, that is.. that is..
is his credo.

32
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,354
He's told me many times,
that it's his credo.

33
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,788
What is your credo, Andy?

34
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,827
Uhh, ya know, I don't know if I can really sum up ...

35
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,626
my whole value system
in a couple of sentences. It's quite complex.

36
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,427
Give it a shot, buddy. Okay?

37
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,025
Okay. I umm.. Well, I umm...

38
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,272
I believe in err.. I believe in justice..

39
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,503
and uh.. I think that everyone has the right to aa..

40
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,307
- To assemble.
- We have to go to the bathroom ...

41
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,881
And make a little.. pee-pee.

42
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,574
Eva.

43
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,887
Okay. Don't be long~ We'll miss you~

44
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,017
What the fuck are you talking about?

45
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,959
- What the fuck am I? What the fuck are you talking about?
- Me?

46
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,327
I don't remember what that was.
I stopped listening. I zoned out.

47
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,992
I'm looking at you. You're saying words that dont make sense..

48
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,830
Andy, do me a favor. Just pay attention, okay?

49
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,904
We're this close to "Pussy Town".

50
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,530
This close. We're sitting at the gas station
right outside the "Pussy Town"..

51
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,338
with an orange crush and a slim jim and 
we're gonna cruise on in to "Pussy Town".

52
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,969
Please stop saying "Pussy Town".

53
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,442
Listen, I am rusty. Alright.

54
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,039
I don't know what you expect. I am rusty.

55
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,346
But they are stewardess.

56
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,787
From Lufthansa!

57
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,800
GROUP SEX

58
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,638
No, goddammit. I mean what the fu-

59
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,644
I mean look ...

60
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,575
God! Look at you!
Look at you.

61
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,118
You are sexy and you're gorgeus and you're...

62
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,451
Guys, I'm insane that I'm not into this right now. You know?
I mean..

63
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,082
- What are we doing here?
- We're enjoying it, Andy.

64
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,683
We're having fun.

65
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,195
No! It's not fun for me. No, it's not!

66
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,456
You know, it's not fun for me unless.. unless..

67
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,831
I feel something. And I don't.

68
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,927
I don't feel anything.

69
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,165
You know, I don't care about you, at all.

70
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,643
Urgh, I'm sorry.

71
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,105
Fine.

72
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,408
Just.. eat me out?

73
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,624
Morning sunshine!

74
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,763
If these are'nt the fluffiest, the most delicious
pancakes on the planet.

75
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,700
I had to batter the eggs and the milk. And I thought

76
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,829
You know what, how do I wake these up?

77
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,497
Baking powder. A'ight.

78
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,075
But I want that butter milk flavor. The butter's the key.

79
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,168
Ya. Please, please. Tell me it's not you.

80
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,071
Oh, I got this maple syrup from this guy in Vermont, off eBay.

81
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,083
The farmer only makes
40 bottles a year ...

82
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,482
it's like a freaking Lorenzo's oil.

83
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,451
Is that Inge from last night?

84
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,714
Oh yea yea yea,
I recorded em on my site. Stored 'em on my 80 gig.

85
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,793
Mine did'nt work out. I sent her home.

86
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,157
Yea you did. Home to papa.

87
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,635
700 Dinki Doughnuts franchise around the country.

88
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,973
You don't mention that?

89
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,607
You give me robots tossing giant
doughnuts on a skyscraper..

90
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,844
doughnuts spaceships.. shooting..

91
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,581
lasers at robots.

92
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,122
- Doughnuts and robots.
- Robots and Donuts.

93
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,691
- Robots and Donuts.
- Doughnuts and robots.

94
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,455
Who do these little cartoons?

95
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,689
Oh, it's a.. it's Andy. He's got an eye.

96
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,594
That's it?

97
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,635
I keep hearing what an amazing,
creative team you are..

98
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,863
- I dont see it.
- Oh, Come on now Alan ...

99
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,439
these are my.. these are my "A-Team".

100
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,135
You said you wanted a fresh.. these guys are more
plugged into the culture more than anybody I've got.

101
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,610
Oh maybe I should plug my business into another agency..

102
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,045
because they guys clearly miscalculated.

103
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,878
Looks like you guys miscalculated. That happens.

104
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,147
You know we did. We tried the
robots and doughnuts idea..

105
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,653
We thought it would be hot.. sticky..

106
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,744
They went for sticky and hot.

107
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,615
We thought it would have 'Pop".

108
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,616
It should have "Pop", didn't "Pop". I've never
seen anything like it. It happens.

109
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,821
What.. What is funny, is that this is our plan B.

110
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,524
We have a plan A, along the lines of what 
you've been talking about.

111
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,692
You know.. tradition and quality.
Give us a couple of days.

112
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,064
A couple of days. A few days. Err, two days.

113
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,637
- Two days is good.
- Two days ...

114
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,434
That's all they need. Two days. You can do that. Ya?

115
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,473
No.

116
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,011
- Excuse me?
- I mean yeah, we can come up with something else. No problem.

117
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,580
But it's not gonna be as good as this.

118
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,649
Oh, wait a minute..

119
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,012
No! This is really good ...

120
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,518
really creative, out-of-the-box stuff here..

121
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,487
and if you can't see that, I dont think it's our problem..
 I think that's your problem.

122
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,082
And maybe this isn't the right agency for you.
Cause I tell you something..

123
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,890
It's not about wether or not your doughtnot is delicious..

124
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,658
It's about you bringing your brand into the 21st century.

125
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,068
This is bullshit, Jerry.

126
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,140
What the fuck! Was that?

127
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,078
Guys.. Guys..

128
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,615
Fine, you got me.

129
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,378
We'll do it your way.

130
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,649
Personally I don't get it, but uh.. we'll pitch my dad.

131
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,417
God, you guys got balls.

132
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,458
Oh yea, they got two.. four big ball.

133
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,652
big..

134
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,733
Incredible.

135
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,666
That was.. amazing.

136
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,966
I don't want to say it but
I'm proud of you man.

137
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,904
I don't know which way it's gonna go..

138
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,669
you played that guy perfectly.

139
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,540
Perfectly, man!

140
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,808
I was'nt playing him. Jerry.

141
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,381
I'm just sick with the bullshit in my life

142
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,507
- Good for you.
- Yeah, I'm tired of it.

143
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,882
I'm tired of the
one-night stand..

144
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,081
I'm tired of.. of crashing at your place for the past six months..

145
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,952
and I'm tired of feeling
sorry for myself ...

146
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,925
because my fiancée
slept with some dick from the gym

147
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,189
and then dump me after 5 fantastic years together.

148
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,525
Good, vent!

149
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,091
- I just.. I'm taking a stand against bullshit.
- Get it out.

150
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,862
- You want to know what my credo is, Jerry?
- What's that?

151
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:17,958
No more bullshit.

152
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,095
I love that credo. Great, let's celebrate that credo tonight.

153
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,471
I've got an amazing situation lined up for us tonight.

154
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,838
- Jerry.
- Yeah?

155
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,777
Why shouldn't you just, get the slightest 
bit sick of me? Little bit?

156
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,548
Sick of you? No.

157
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,207
We work together, we live together ...

158
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,182
we hang out together every night ...

159
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,015
it.. that's not healthy.

160
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,521
- What's not healthy?
- Us!

161
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,682
- What're you saying? What, you got plans tonight?
- Yes

162
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,123
Okay. Good. What are we doing?

163
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,816
Thank you.

164
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,694
- Fucker!
- Sorry, sorry.

165
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,696
Hey, hey wait!

166
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,985
What, Jerry?

167
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,587
Yea listen up, Phoebe, Giselle and the girls ...

168
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,256
want to talk about airbrushing and retouching

169
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,330
and I told my art director was on his way

170
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,394
Uh-huh.

171
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,065
Listen, get your ass back to "Pussy Town" man,
we're about to play "Spin the models".

172
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,867
Alright. Sounds good, man. Have a good time!

173
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,941
Alright, bye!

174
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,731
First time?

175
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,177
Uhh, yeah.

176
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,203
Burton.

177
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,704
Andy.

178
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,178
Did you call Helen to let her know you're coming?

179
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,781
No, actually.

180
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,753
Just wandered off the street?

181
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,989
- Kinda, yea.
- Fate.

182
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,586
Shall we?

183
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,099
They're not gonna bite.

184
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,897
Unless you ask them nicely.

185
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,168
Okay everybody. Let's take our seat.

186
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,801
It's an exciting day.

187
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,142
We have somebody brand new wants to come 
and join the group.

188
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,183
Please come sit down, right here. There's a chair for you.

189
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,015
Ladies and gentlemen. May I introduce, Andy.

190
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,148
- Hi, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

191
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,058
And Andy would like permission to join our group.
 Any objections?

192
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,453
Okay. Welcome.

193
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,863
I would like to start the introduction.

194
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,163
I'm Burton ...

195
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,669
And I'm a sex addict.

196
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,470
I'm Tiffany, I'm a sex addict too.

197
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,067
But I'm celebrating 94 days now.

198
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,010
I'm Franny. I'm addicted to love ...

199
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,209
and I love to love bad men.

200
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,845
My name is Herman, December 10th..

201
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,888
I'll have 19 years hooker-free.

202
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,958
I'm Ramon, you know why I'm here.

203
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,223
Hye. Donny. Sex addict.

204
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,989
Unemployed, compulsive masturbator. 
How's everyone doing?

205
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,698
Hi, I'm Vanessa ...

206
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,497
and I am addicted to sex.

207
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,208
Dude, this is genious. 
Why did'nt we think of this before?

208
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,714
I mean this is better than the Pilates, Bible study. 
That book club that we joined.

209
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,647
Tell me about this chick.

210
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,912
What's this nymphit? What's her kink?

211
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,318
Hey, her name is Vanessa ...

212
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,117
and she is a sex and love addict.

213
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,383
Okay, so what's she into? Last bottom boat? 
Space docking?

214
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,394
velging, cleveland steamer, the blumpkin..

215
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,054
the chilly dog, the rusty trambones,

216
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,394
the dirty sanchez.. What's she like?

217
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,626
What is wrong with you?

218
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,497
Jerry, it's a disease. Okay?

219
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,798
- Can we show her some respect, please?
- A "Disease"?

220
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,133
It's not a disease, Andy.

221
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,772
A disease is when you
wake up with some chick..

222
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,672
and she got crusted cheese in her underwear. 
She's got to go to the hospital.

223
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,801
That's a disease.

224
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,175
You're really into this nymph. Good for you.

225
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,947
You know what, this is something that's.. that's weird..

226
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,715
she said she recently left Jumbo's Clown Room.. right..

227
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,620
and that this Jumbo's Clown Room was ...

228
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,625
this really dangerous place for her.

229
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,560
And I know, it's gotta be a metaphor for something.. 
but I think..

230
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:29,032
What, is she like..traumatized by party clown? 
When she was a kid or something?

231
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,766
- Jumbo's Clown Room huh?
- Yeah, Jumbo's Clown Room.

232
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,465
Maybe that's what she call her vagina. 
Maybe it's just so big and so much fun

233
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,270
Jerry, don't make fun of her. It's very sad.

234
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,436
[ Jumbo's Clown Room ]

235
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,743
No, no, no, no, no. I'm telling ya' this is a
terrible coincidence.

236
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,284
There's no way she worked here.

237
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,820
Do you have any idea how much cash this chicks 
reeks in every night?

238
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,447
Please, it does not matter, I'm telling you 
there's no way Vanessa worked here.

239
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,650
Vanessa worked here.

240
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,056
She seals my heart at.

241
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:59,320
Oh.. this is sad Andy, you're right. Oh, so sad..

242
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,955
Alright, alright, alright she used to work here. Right?

243
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,397
which means that she quit..

244
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,901
which means.. that she's making real progress. 
Thank you.

245
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,029
Yea, so was I. Hey, keep digging. OK?

246
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,606
We haven't struck oil yet.

247
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,577
- Pretty sure this is illegal, man.
- Okay.

248
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,610
Have you ever dated a nice guy?

249
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,849
We're not really taking about me right now, but..

250
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,383
that's the thing

251
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,581
What are you doing?

252
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,822
Can you see that?

253
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,719
What?

254
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,656
Oh, someone is doing something huge today.

255
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,731
Earth shattering.

256
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:40,066
Lives changing huge.

257
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,073
What is it?

258
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,434
He's here.

259
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,639
Who?

260
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,009
You.

261
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,980
Okay everybody, let's come together..

262
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,552
we have a limited amount of time.

263
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,448
So, after.. after I.. you know, pleasured myself..

264
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,115
in every room in the apartment ...

265
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,995
and also the.. the laundry room..

266
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,724
- And the lobby
- Right.

267
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,062
A couple of times, I needed to get out..

268
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,636
so I.. I went to get my haircut.

269
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,398
- You looks great.
- Thanks man.

270
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,805
- But err, you know how they gave you a shampoo beforehand..
- It's very creamy.

271
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,104
Favourite part.

272
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,944
And err, the woman they have there ...

273
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,381
she really gets in there, on the scalp,
and she really rubs your head..

274
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,181
and she smells good, and
the shampoo smells so good.

275
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,049
and I'm wearing an apron right? So I.. I figured..

276
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,647
Who's gonna notice?

277
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,051
- She noticed.
- Duh~

278
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,055
Ramon.

279
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,057
That's my second strike.

280
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,534
- Did she call the cop?
- Yeah.

281
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,367
One more.. and I'm doing serious time.

282
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,409
Then if that's true, Donny?

283
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,035
What is your bottomline, this coming week?

284
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,505
- Only at home.
- Here's the question..

285
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,173
Can you handle that?

286
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,844
- I think that I can.
- I know you can.

287
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,480
Because I've been getting into 
the whole condiment things, lately.

288
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,120
- Oh, tell us about that.
- It's all in my fridge.

289
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,555
It's genious, right?

290
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,630
Mayo' I mean that's a given. That's old school.

291
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,824
The kids are doing that, but the mustard ...

292
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,059
what? Totally.

293
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,570
Tabasco sauce you have to be careful with..

294
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,104
because if it gets in your urethra, 
burn the shit out of ya'..

295
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,074
Yea, right at the tip of the penis.

296
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,543
But the.. relish ..

297
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,704
relish!

298
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,008
because it's bumpy.

299
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,743
Good meeting girls.

300
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,582
See you next week.

301
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,787
Uh excuse me, Vanessa.

302
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:43,021
I was wondering maybe sometime you'd be interested 
in getting a cup of coffee with me or something?.. and..

303
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,901
Andy!

304
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,995
Hey, I'm Herman, this is Donny.

305
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,903
- Hey.
- Hey.

306
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,566
Donny.

307
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,576
Err, we're gonna get something to eat..

308
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,841
- Good, have fun.
- Yeah..

309
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,712
- We are.. gonna get something to eat.
- Yeah.

310
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,644
There's this place down by where I live..

311
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,088
they've got a whole section devoted 
exclusively to the anus.

312
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,092
And I'm not talking about gay anus..

313
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,094
I'm talking hetero' anus.

314
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,720
They've got like a thousand title..

315
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,823
One month I spent $ 2,000 in there..

316
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,901
I maxed up my Visa, Mastercard, Optima..

317
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,470
What can I say, I'm a tush man..

318
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,098
You know, the asshole is the new vagina.

319
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,801
Yes it is.

320
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,845
Hey. Here's a little tush for the tush man, hmm?

321
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,441
- Hey Mr, Cleavage.
- Hello.

322
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,608
I gotta' a date tonight.

323
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,709
What do you think? I mean, you know ...

324
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,947
I can like, put 'em like this..

325
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,457
or maybe push 'em in and.. lift 'em up at the same time.

326
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,060
Those are all good options ...

327
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,425
but I.. I think that's erm.. false advertising..

328
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,296
because that's not what they're gonna look like, 
for realsies when I get up in there.

329
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,698
I will fuck you in half, you little pygmy.

330
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,902
Who's the new meat? Hurm~

331
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,564
Urm, Lisa, this is Andy.

332
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,936
- Hey, Andy.
- Hi.

333
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,806
- What's your kink?
- I'm sorry? What's my kink?

334
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,779
Ya, come on, man. I've been serving these sickos for years.. please..

335
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,750
This one, beats his dick like it owes him money.

336
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,377
That one, would drill a hole in a ham and fuck it.

337
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,481
What's you thing, Andy? What's your freaky freaky thang'?

338
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,625
Well, to be completely honest with you, 
I'm not into the freaky freaky.

339
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,022
Yeah, me neither.

340
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,731
I was in there for a second, I was really in there.

341
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,602
Back in a minute.

342
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,770
Donny, how's that only at home going for ya'.

343
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,679
He tries.

344
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,911
Listen, I'm gonna get going. So thanks a lot for everything..

345
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,011
No, I just want to talk with ya' up first, Andy..

346
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,953
I noticed that you've err...

347
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,116
taken a special interest in Vanessa..

348
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,486
- Vanessa? No, I haven't..
- Well, I would'nt blame ya.

349
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,564
I mean she's beautiful, smart, funny ...

350
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,724
talented, I mean.. makes sense.

351
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,859
But, a couple of months ago, she was a mess.

352
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,064
And she was strippin' every night at Jumbo's.

353
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,437
And uh, she's come a long way..

354
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,340
because of the group. I got her a job ...

355
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,909
with Dr. Pete Craig, he's a veterinarian.

356
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,482
We got her to move out of Luke's place and..

357
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,076
she's really a set. I am very proud of her.

358
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,350
That's why we have an ironclad rule..

359
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,551
you can not date anyone else in the group ...

360
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,518
ever.

361
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,630
Not negotiable.

362
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,422
Do you understand what I'm saying?

363
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,958
Oh yeah, no, no, I understand.

364
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,500
Yeah.

365
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,403
Hey, guys, what did I miss?

366
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,532
Oh, I was giving him the talk.

367
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,577
Oh, the talk, good.

368
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,474
How did it go?

369
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,742
I think Andy understands it very, very well.

370
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,374
- Good.
- Hey, you guys finished it here?

371
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,749
- You want me to wrap this up, to go?
- Yes, please.

372
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,448
Oh, can i get a side of relish in it to go?

373
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,154
I will kick you in the cunt, you little douche.

374
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,756
Well, we're out of relish.

375
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,460
- Oh no, you did'nt.
- Urgh, what a discovery man.

376
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,629
That freak is like the Christopher
Columbus of wacking off..

377
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,036
I had it rested
between my legs ...

378
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,732
looks like a dodger dodge.

379
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,070
- What else did you learn?
- Nothing.

380
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,610
Nothing? What did you mean with nothing? 
You're breaking breads with this sickos..

381
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,873
- You're an honorary pervert.
- Yeah, that's exactly the problem, because they

382
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:26,917
have all this rules. The worst one is that 
members can't date other member.

383
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,411
I don't know who am I kidding. 
This is impossible.

384
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,456
Oww, nothing's impossible man. This
rules don't apply to you.

385
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,822
So you can't date other member that 
you meet in the group, meet her somewhere else.

386
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,793
This one.. I'm thinking of taking it home myself.

387
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,368
- Uh huh..
- She's fixed..

388
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,801
looking for a loving home, she's just got all her shots.

389
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,099
I don't think so.

390
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,366
Are you sure? They dont get any sweeter, don't they?

391
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,002
- I can see that.
- There's no one sweeter than me~..

392
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,049
Well, what kind of dog are you looking for?

393
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,110
Well.. injured.

394
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,103
Tell you what.

395
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,798
You help me make a good impression..

396
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,570
I scratch your tummy for you.

397
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,406
Like this. This is a little taste of it.

398
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,072
Like that?

399
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,116
You like when I scratch your tummy..

400
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,146
Oh shit. Oh Shit!

401
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,769
- Hey.
- Hi.

402
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,864
Uh, wow! What a coincidence.

403
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,772
It's me, Andy, from the meetings.

404
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,969
Yeah.

405
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,943
Yea, I know who you are.

406
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,409
An accident, on me.

407
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,613
So crazy running into you like this. 
I can't believe this.

408
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,053
You know what, I think you made a mistake.

409
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,489
You wrote Andy down, as the dog's name.

410
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,689
Yea, yeah, it's name Andy
too. Yea, we're both, we're both Andy.

411
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:23,996
You know, he's really a.. sweet and, 
and caring, and just a great companion..

412
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,660
You know that Andy all he wants is love.

413
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,261
You mean "she."

414
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,474
- Yeah, she of course.
- Okay.

415
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,805
So, what is the matter with.. Andy?

416
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,105
Arh, her leg.

417
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,607
It's missing.

418
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:39,681
It's very sad.

419
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,982
But you.. are working with
animals and helping them.. That's amaz..

420
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,783
- How rewarding is..
- Why are you here?

421
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,052
I really wanna grab that
coffee with you sometime.

422
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,618
And I've been out with Herman and Donny, 
and they gave me the whole talk ...

423
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,493
so I know all the rules .. but..

424
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,691
you ran out before I got a chance to tell you ...

425
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,566
I'm not an addict..

426
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,795
so there's really no problem with us..

427
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,929
You're not.. a sex addict?

428
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,877
I know, I sound really crazy but ...

429
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,069
listen..

430
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,840
I'm a good person ..

431
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,575
and I just really want to get to know you better.

432
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,110
Well, I can't discuss this here..

433
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,585
but I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow. Alright?

434
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,452
The doctor will be right in. Bye, Andy. Bye baby.

435
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,823
I can handle the Halitosis..

436
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,561
But I don't know guys, if I can commit..

437
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,729
to a man who falls asleep..

438
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,105
during foreplay.

439
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,507
Two hours of Cunnilingus is a lot to ask..

440
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,637
- Of any man.
- Maybe that's where he gets the Halitosis.

441
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,045
Seriously, not to mention the lockjaw, man.

442
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,947
My jaw hurts just hearing that story, am I right?

443
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,986
- Ramon..
- Yes, I'm sorry.

444
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,816
Thank you so much for your insight.

445
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,819
Vanessa, I think you're up.

446
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,895
Well, I got a gig of my own.

447
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,361
Great.

448
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:05,425
The place was a total dive, and there's like, I don't know,
three people there but ...

449
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,836
it's the first thing that I've
done without Luke as my manager.

450
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,966
Is that douchebag still holding
your demo tape hostage?

451
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:16,104
Yea, he still has the demo tape but 
there's really nothing I can do about that ...

452
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:19,206
But you know what
I can do, you know what I'm going to do?

453
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,213
I'm moving out, I'm moving in with Tiff.

454
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,147
Roommates!

455
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,658
- Sleepover!
- That is wonderful.

456
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,855
Alright now for you, the next time you fall in love with somebody..

457
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,523
he's gonna be a guy that take care of you ...

458
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,534
who will not manipulate you with sex ...

459
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,003
- Am I right?
- I did meet someone recently.

460
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,733
Could you tell us about that?

461
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,969
Well actually it's someone right here in this room.

462
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,945
Yea, this person ...

463
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,248
Has made me realize how ready I am to meet
a decent, honorable guy.

464
00:25:56,354 --> 00:26:00,120
And that's because he's not decent or honorable.

465
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,417
He saw me sing ...

466
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,960
Came looking for me at Jumbo's ...

467
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,553
he did'nt think that I knew about that, but I did.

468
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:11,659
And he came to see me at work yesterday
pretending it was a coincidence.

469
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,637
And when I walk into the examination room..

470
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,902
I caught him spanking it through his pant in front of a crippled dog.

471
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:18,976
I was not!

472
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,506
Who are you and what are you doing here?

473
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:28,744
This is the only place in my life where I feel completely safe.

474
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,879
And if you're just gonna come in here and ruin it for me..

475
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,821
then you better have
a damn good explanation.

476
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,860
Hell yeah, you better have a good explanation.

477
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,863
You better start talking right now bro, I don't hear anything.

478
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,091
Come on, man. Say something.

479
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,064
Excuse me, young man...

480
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,433
Don't you feel compelled to
answer any of those allegations?

481
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,936
Guess what guys, I'm not a sex addict.

482
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,878
Bullshit!

483
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:01,043
I'm only here.. because I wanted to meet Vanessa.

484
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,949
I saw her sing that night ...

485
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,955
and then I followed her here.

486
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,184
Yea, right, okay, it's clear as it got.

487
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,593
You go cruising..

488
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,754
you meet a stranger, become obsessed ...

489
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,422
you stalk her..

490
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,864
you masturbate in her office ...

491
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,062
textbook. Please, please. Welcome.

492
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,197
- What? It's not textbook, it's crazy ...
- Andy, Andy..

493
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,137
- It's time to come clean, man.
- What?

494
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,940
Be honest with yourself,
you lying piece of shit!

495
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,538
- Come on, bro. Spit it out.
- Andy ...

496
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,710
this is what we call
an "intervention."

497
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,878
No, no, no Herman, this is my girl and..

498
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,149
and he lied to us, and he used us..

499
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,725
and for that, you are going down!

500
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,730
I did'nt do anything. What?

501
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,997
Alright, alright, fine! I am a sex crazed..

502
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,041
a sexy, horny

503
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,543
a sex.. sex monkey, okay?

504
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,273
- Is that what you want to hear?
- Yes, that's what we want to hear.

505
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,948
Squeeze it out. Push it out. Purge yourself!

506
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,111
I'll squeeze, I'll squeeze! You want to hear some squeeze?

507
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,244
I'll tell ya' this ...

508
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,990
I, I, I love women. I love women! Alright?!

509
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,891
I live to please.. them! Alright?!

510
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,557
And when I.. when I work that G-Spot ..

511
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,157
you know, when I..

512
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,170
when I do that ... It's like "boom"!

513
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,103
Mr. G-Spot! That's what they call me.

514
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,142
-What do they call me?!
- Mr. G-Spot!

515
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,303
-What do they fuckin' call me?!
- Mr. G-Spot!

516
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,845
That's right. Mr. G-Spot!

517
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,077
I live in "Pussy Town".

518
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,018
Yeah, I live in ...

519
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,523
- I'm on the city council of "Pussy Town".
- I know what you mean.

520
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,527
Oh, my tongue, my tongue. I'll tell you about my tongue!

521
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,824
The things I do with my tongue. Oh yes!..

522
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,695
I can lick with it ...

523
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,734
and I.. I suck with it ...

524
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,066
yeah, yeah!

525
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,103
so ...

526
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,202
- Andy..
- What?

527
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,743
Welcome home.

528
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:29,090
Watch this takes. It's where it builds. 
It's dynamic.

529
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,959
Oh, you've tweaked that, dog~

530
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,620
It gets better. So what do you guys think?

531
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,697
It was.. what was it Andy?

532
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,497
Perff, dreadful.

533
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,432
Err.. What didn't you like about it?

534
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,440
We do not like ...

535
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,576
the part where you were...

536
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,441
pressing the keys down and making noise.

537
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,674
Everything else was spot on, you know, the hair ...

538
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,046
love that, love that you were 
spitting while you were singing..

539
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,709
River's got half his
Breakfast in his beard ...

540
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,151
I love to know what he have for breakfast this morning.

541
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,085
- That was good.
- That was good~.

542
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,627
So err, mangled spitting, singing, those were good notes.

543
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,025
Good meeting, guys. Let's crank it up!

544
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,957
What? Come on.

545
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:39,195
- They are a great musical team.
- I know, I know...

546
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,431
I'm not worried about them..

547
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,530
Vanessa is just...

548
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,269
Look, Andy. I'm not gonna lie to ya'. 
This is a rough situation.

549
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,037
I mean, maybe I'm missing something..

550
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,481
but, this girl is.. a sex addict.

551
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,677
Right? Which mean she is addicted to sex.

552
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:58,313
Hello? Low hanging fruit! 
Pull it off the goddamn tree already!

553
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,448
Are you listening to anything I'm saying?

554
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,686
- She hates me.
- I know, she hates you! Which is a good thing.

555
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,888
Hatred is like foreplay for this sex monsters.

556
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,329
You know you belong in
these meetings. You know that right?

557
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,163
You should have seen what kind of freak they 
thought I was when I started talking like you

558
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,601
Okay. Well you clearly used me
out of context.. 'cause..

559
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,639
what I have is a
gift, not a disease.

560
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,105
- Oh, you're a gift?
- Yes!

561
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,507
Every woman has at least one thing that 
gets her highly excitable.

562
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,637
I find out what that one thing is and I work it.

563
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,545
Until ecstasy is the inevitable result. Exactly!

564
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,550
This is a skill that very few possess.

565
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,176
It's a God given talent, Andy.

566
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,619
You know what, I'll clarify at the next meeting.

567
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,089
Yea.. Wait. What? No..

568
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:39,459
Hey, hey. Look, look right here. That is never going to happen. 
You understand that? You are never ever coming to a meeting with me. You got it?

569
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,896
You know what you need?
Fresh perspective.

570
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,903
Come on, look at the way she controls 
that beast with her thigh muscles.

571
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,635
That's the way they talk to the horses, you know. 
With the thigh muscles.

572
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,006
That's good.

573
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,876
Oh man, women who
ride horses are super sexualized. That's a fact.

574
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,608
And that's why young girls loves unicorn.

575
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,513
It's essentially white horses with a dick on its' head.

576
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,612
It's a no brainer. We go down to the equestrian centre..

577
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,849
we stand on the side of the field, 
we wait for them to just ride around to get wet and ready.

578
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,926
That's what riding does, it gets them all
wet and ready.

579
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,085
What? I'm serious.

580
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,856
When that chick gets off her horse, 
she's gonna go rub one out.

581
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,262
And we'll be the only thing standing 
between that horse and that chick..

582
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:16,898
doing her beef trips.

583
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,992
Oh, please don't say "beef trips."

584
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,633
Look at them bounce. I love it.

585
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,708
- Hello?
- Who's that?

586
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,210
- Donny.
- Is that relish?

587
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,781
- Tell him I'm a fan. I'm a fan relish!
- Shut up.

588
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,608
- Yea, what's the problem?
- Andy, get off the phone. Come on man, fresh perspective.

589
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,914
- There's a problem with Herman.
- Who the fuck's Herman?

590
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,785
- It's one of the guys in the group.
- Oh, come on. The hell's with them, let's go!

591
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:44,453
- Wait, hooker!?
- Andy, Andy. Come on man, the jumpers alone cost me $300.

592
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,654
Are you coming?

593
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,061
- There he is, there he is.
- Oh, alright.

594
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,936
- What's going on?
- A'ight, here's the situation..

595
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,410
he's been in his van for almost an hour.
 We tried to talk him down.

596
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,073
- Nothing's working, bro.
-I.. I thought he called you guys for help?

597
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,651
- Yea, he did.
- Yes, there is.. there was a phone call, yes..

598
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,880
but then he just got this far away sound 
in his voice and he was cut off.

599
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,924
like he wasn't himself anymore and 
now he won't even answer his cellphone.

600
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,686
He totally shut us down, bro.

601
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,557
- What's up with that pant? Seriously.
- You ride?

602
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,097
Look, he'll listen to you, okay? 
'Cause you've been there before..

603
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,827
- But we're ...
- Don't look at 'em, bro..

604
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,733
It is such a friendly neighborhood. 
I gotta go. I'm in a good place right now..

605
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,897
and it's just not good to be here. 
So I'm gonna bolt, good luck!

606
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,032
Seriously brother, this place is way too cheap, man..

607
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,702
you can get blonde for a bucket of chicken and 
I just got paid, brother.

608
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:36,837
- We're out of here.
- What do you guys mean, you guys gotta bolt?

609
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,248
What am I supposed to.. I don't know what to say to him.

610
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,648
We're gay! We're gay!

611
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,685
You gotta be..!

612
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,027
Go away!

613
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,365
Alright.

614
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,676
So, what's.. what's going on?

615
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,214
Whatever it is that you did..

616
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,790
it's.. it's done now..

617
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,950
Why don't we just go home?

618
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:26,394
I did'nt.. fucking.. do anything yet.

619
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,257
What do you mean?

620
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:30,925
Rock ...

621
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,034
Are we going to do some business or what?

622
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,231
It stinks like rat poison back here ...

623
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,069
and I didn't agree to no threeway.

624
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,873
You guys are kinky and little jocky? 
No-uh, that's extra.

625
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,713
Did you forget how to blow?

626
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,944
- Fuck you, Ramon.
- You're not allowed, remember?

627
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,882
Shut up.

628
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:59,452
A hundred long lonely nights of celibacy.

629
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,929
Three things got me through.

630
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,757
My waterpick,

631
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,459
breaking boards to the head,

632
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,800
and seein' your ugly faces every week.

633
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,430
That really killed my sex drive. I love you guys!

634
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,771
And love you too, Tiffany.

635
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,943
What are you freaks celebrating, huh?

636
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,480
Let me guess. You all got together, jizz on a cookie..

637
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,517
and you got to eat 'em, huh, mericon'..

638
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,980
I love you guys. I love you...

639
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,349
because you all wants to fuck me..

640
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,753
and that's incredibly good for my self-esteem.

641
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:27,825
I'll go cut this up.

642
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,950
You know my self-esteem is not that high ...

643
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,996
but it would be a lot lower
if it were'nt for a special someone...

644
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,895
who got my ass out of a
very sticky situation.

645
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,560
- To Andy.
- No, I'm talking bout the hooker.

646
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,761
She's lookin' hot!

647
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,767
To Andy!

648
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,849
- It's raining.
- I know.

649
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,787
- I drive a scooter.
- Youre gonna get wet.

650
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,586
Damn it, open the door!

651
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,099
- I'll be just a minute.
- Take your time.

652
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,503
Most of 'em are sleeping. 
It's just this little girl right here...

653
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,771
who has a hard time. Yea, baby.

654
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,780
It's okay, Paula Abdul. I'm here now.

655
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,792
She only falls asleep in my arms.

656
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,594
Are you on the clock right now?

657
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:40,961
What am I supposed to do?

658
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,976
You know I think I might have misjudged you.

659
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,572
Yeah?

660
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,309
You're even sicker than I thought.

661
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:13,993
You're home late.

662
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,192
Jesus Jerry, you scared the shit out of me.

663
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,961
Anywhere on your calendar does it
says "Drinks with Reeves?

664
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,203
Oh shit. I'm sorry, man.

665
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,740
I totally forgot about that.

666
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,937
Yea, apparently he was going to talk 
with us about something important, something about our future..

667
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,105
Is he gonna make us partner?

668
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,944
Oh, I don't know, we were'nt there to find out.

669
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,919
What I do know, is that Dinki Donuts 
would be the biggest account that Reeves' ever had

670
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:41,219
- Yea, I know.
- I also know that right now we have no shot at it.

671
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,687
Why?

672
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,424
Well, maybe it's because you're doing it again, Andy.

673
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,191
You're changing, you're becoming the object of your affection.

674
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,435
Will the real Andy grow a sack of nuts 
and be counted for

675
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,025
who you are instead of who you're with.

676
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,468
Alright, you're talking out your ass.

677
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,665
Andy, I've known you since forever. 
This is your fatal flaw.

678
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:00,232
With women you're a.. you're a
chameleon like one of those color changing lizards.

679
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,911
I know what a chameleon is, Jerry.

680
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,709
Come here. Sit down, I want to show you something
I've been working on a long time.

681
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,873
Andrew.

682
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,419
[ Andy Youngman :
Man of 1,000 Faces]

683
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,627
So ...

684
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,960
First, there was Heidi. Rar-rarr.

685
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,464
Getting all tubular and gnarly with Zoey.

686
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,198
I think she dumped you two weeks after 
I took this photo if my memory serves.

687
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,936
Throwin' down mad rhymes with Tisha.

688
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,478
Aww, My. Earthy Poet Man.

689
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,845
See, I.. I can't even find you in this photo.

690
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,146
Come one, where the fuck are ya'?

691
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,249
Imagine that.

692
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,989
Whoops, wait a second. That's not 
supposed to be in there.

693
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,134
And finally, Cynthia.

694
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,031
Or as I'd like to call her, Medusa ...

695
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,660
- The devil woman.
- Stop.

696
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,671
She was so much more deceptive than the others ...

697
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,764
because with her, see you looked like Andy ...

698
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,035
but you were'nt Andy.

699
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,941
It was like "Invasion body snatching pussy"

700
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,707
Okay, thank you. You made your point.

701
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,783
Andy, what happened to your credo?

702
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,181
Huh, no more bullshit? What happen to that?

703
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,254
I mean, we've got a fuckin' three legged dog.

704
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,017
Named Andy.

705
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,183
I love you.

706
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,123
Come on, pinky swear me right now..

707
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,024
that you are finished with these perverts.

708
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,653
I'm not gonna pinky anything with you.

709
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,789
I'm making real progress with Vanessa.

710
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,696
In case you haven't noticed, that's important to me.

711
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,468
I promise you this:

712
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,899
I will not lose sight of who I really am. Okay?

713
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,207
I just got obsessed by little men.

714
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,140
I'm addicted to hand jobs... from men.

715
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,811
My cock understands me.

716
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:52,150
I got really into mail order brides.

717
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,518
I don't know what ...

718
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,223
that old man wanted.

719
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,189
It was hard to hear through the
oxygen mask.

720
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,230
I started caressing his
penis, I couldn't help it.

721
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,034
I kept going to see them 
little midget at them circus.

722
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,831
I'm not gay.

723
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:07,835
Just lazy.

724
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,701
The next thing I know, I was just being..

725
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,538
escorted out of the funeral parlor.

726
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,668
The smell of tapioca just..

727
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,643
it made my dick hard.

728
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,408
When it gets angry, it kinda look like..

729
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,711
Karl Malden's nose, you know, kinda' bulbous.

730
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,117
I can not stop. I have to have it.

731
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,016
He said "Hey man, I'm not gay."

732
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,389
And I'm like, "Shit, that's.. 
that's just good business." You know.

733
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,928
I had two of them fucked me in that little midget car.

734
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,955
I mean, little people.

735
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,624
People look at you funny if 
you pull your cock out in public.

736
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,630
Thanks. Thanks alot. It was awesome.

737
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,848
Oh my god. She lived in this dump 
with that animal for 2 years.

738
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,545
Where's this animal now?

739
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:56,915
He's at work. We're good.

740
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,046
So where's.. where's the demo.. 
where did she say it was?

741
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,488
She said there, in the bedroom.

742
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,719
There are weapons on the table, fellas.

743
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,092
I don't feel good about this.

744
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,792
This is not our places.

745
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,901
Okay. Let's go.

746
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,833
It smells like old socks.

747
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,369
I think I'm havin' a panic attack.

748
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,431
I have it.

749
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,670
Let's get out of here before the animal gets back.

750
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:22,803
Oh shit.

751
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,549
So, which one of you called me an animal?

752
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,046
Too ugly. Too fat.

753
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,386
So, you. You must the one doin' her.

754
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:36,920
Sweet piece of ass, huh?

755
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:40,019
Hey, animal, watch your mouth.

756
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,859
Yea, that's not necessary, man.

757
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,531
" Not necessary ?"

758
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,432
Check out the white knight 
protecting his lady's honor.

759
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,767
You care to duel, "Sir Puss Alot"?

760
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,569
Yea, duel him.

761
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,671
I'm talking to you, ass hat.

762
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,439
Yea, I heard you. No, no I don't care to duel.

763
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,708
Besides, there's three of us..

764
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,306
So we can kick your ass.

765
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,817
Donny, get back here right now.

766
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,822
What do you got there?

767
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,825
Those happen to be my demos, that I produced..

768
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,690
spent six grand on.

769
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,957
Fuck it. She can have 'em.

770
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,726
That girl got no talent.

771
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,924
Tell her I'm keeping the mattress tho'...

772
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,298
as a souvenir.

773
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,031
It's the only place she was ever any use to me.

774
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,766
Okay, we'll tell her.

775
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,401
If I ever see you fella again it won't go so friendly.

776
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,841
- You got that, "Puss"?
- We got it.

777
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,939
No, no, no. He was talking to Andy. 
He was calling Andy a pussy.

778
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,017
I don't think you understand or appreciate 
the urgency of the situation.

779
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,680
We fly to Phoenix in two days
to pitch the campaign.

780
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:43,351
- Two days. So just tell me that we're still a team.
- Yeah, Jerry. Yes, of course we're a team.

781
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,361
You're the talent, and I'm the salesman.

782
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,794
If you don't do your job,
I have nothing to sell.

783
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,059
Your priorities are way out of whack.

784
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,965
You're spending every second with
these t-baggers and chicken chokers and..

785
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,039
- They're taking over our lives.
-That is not true.

786
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,472
- It is not true.
- Okay, well, show...

787
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,981
What? We needed an office guy.

788
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,581
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

789
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,121
I wrote a song for you.

790
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,625
You're kidding me.

791
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,126
You rescued my demo tape. It's the least I could do.

792
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,863
Oh, I heard you were very gallant by the way..

793
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,058
"Sir Puss-Alot"?

794
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,725
Yea..

795
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,031
But I really.. I really didn't do anything.

796
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,072
Actually, you kinda' did.

797
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,071
I sent it to a couple of producers
and this guy want me to showcase

798
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,406
at a party tomorrow night.

799
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,377
Tomorrow? That's incredible.

800
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,382
Alright, alright. 
Just shut up and listen to my song.

801
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,042
I can't believe you wrote
a song for me.

802
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,593
"THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU"

803
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,863
"THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND"

804
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,837
"SOMETHING IN THE WAY YOU FEEL"

805
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:07,068
"WHEN I HOLD YOU IN MY HAND"

806
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,943
"SOMEDAY SOON
SURE AS YOUR GLAZE"

807
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:15,781
"THAT SHINES FOR ALL TO SEE"

808
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:19,083
"WE'LL BE TOGETHER"

809
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,849
"MY DINKI DONUTS"

810
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:28,693
"DINKI DONUTS"

811
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,195
"AND I.."

812
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,240
Wow.

813
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,009
It's not good, I know that.

814
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,918
Donny just.. he told me
that you guys are struggling..

815
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,184
so I came up with something as a joke. Really.

816
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,556
No, no, I don't think you were joking.

817
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,151
You hated it, right?

818
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,457
Actually, urm..

819
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,026
I kinda' loved it.

820
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,232
No way.

821
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,597
Yes way.

822
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,371
Andy, why do you seduce
all those women?

823
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,809
Multiple partners is not what turns me on.

824
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,879
It gets in the way with what
really matters..

825
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,679
intimacy, romances, commitment.

826
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,584
Yes, yes. I think, that is exactly what ...

827
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,457
I have a friend.. a friend who
believes in all that stuff you believes in.

828
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,355
He was.. he was supposed to get married 
to this woman, Cynthia..

829
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,629
but six weeks before the wedding..

830
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,967
she sleeps with some guy from the gym..

831
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,700
- And dumps him.
- Oh god.

832
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:48,574
And he was completely destroyed. 
But even after all that..

833
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,476
he still believes in true love.

834
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,481
And even love at first sight.

835
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,450
- Oh, he sounds like a great guy.
- He's a great guy.

836
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,577
He just gave his heart to
the wrong girl, that's all.

837
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,620
A great guy.

838
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,886
So you tell me, Mr. G-Spot..

839
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,457
What makes you such a good lover?

840
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,101
I.. pay attention.

841
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,927
That's the secret.

842
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,902
I mean, every woman has at least..

843
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,343
one thing.. that, you know, 
makes her highly excitable. So..

844
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:28,582
I just.. I find out what that 
one thing is and work it until..

845
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:33,252
ecstasy is the inevitable result.

846
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,089
You know what gets me highly excitable?

847
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,893
Red wine, Merlot.

848
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,692
A guy all sweaty after work out,

849
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,925
smelling like a man.

850
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,297
Red wine, sweaty, that's good stuff. Interesting.

851
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,103
My feet.

852
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,602
If you give me a foot massage..

853
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,632
And I will lose all control.

854
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,238
Feet.

855
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,180
Why don't you show me one of your secret.

856
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:07,621
Okay.

857
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,607
Oh my god.

858
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:35,118
I bet you make girls crazy just by doing this.

859
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,153
- I'm being a bad girl, right now?
- Ya, me too.

860
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:48,829
I.. gotta go.

861
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,701
- Am I going somewhere with you.. or..?
- No..

862
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,464
We both have big days tomorrow.

863
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,062
- Good luck with your pitchy, Andy.
- Wait.

864
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,920
Why she just turn me off like that?

865
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,580
You know, she tells me all this 
things that gets her off..

866
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,090
Like a Merlot..

867
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,388
a guy all sweaty after a work out..

868
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:19,519
a foot massage..

869
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,791
Why would she tell me if she wasn't into me?

870
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,957
I don't know.

871
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,126
This is only the most important day
of our professional lives.

872
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,170
Let's get our head in the game, okay?

873
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,603
Vitamins. Vitamins.

874
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,311
Lets get real.

875
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,574
I was wrong. Alright?

876
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:42,209
Your ideas are great,
really sharp and err..

877
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,253
Well, you know, 
I don't know what that lingo, but err...

878
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,719
I think my dad's gonna like your pitch.

879
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,256
You've got big balls, kid.

880
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,620
Hung like a grandfather clock.

881
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,559
Take good care of this guys, Ted.

882
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:53,755
Might have to steal them away from you.

883
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:58,801
Hey, don't.. don't threaten me,
Alan. No, no, cause I'm making these two guys partners.

884
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,394
Yeah!

885
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,604
- Salud!
- Here we are.

886
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,313
- Sandy.
- Hey Alan, how are you?

887
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,910
- Yea, good.
- Good.

888
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,353
Good evening, gentlemen. How are you?

889
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,322
We have a great sushi buffet on board..

890
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,587
and some dynamite wine you're just gonna' love.

891
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:28,631
But there's another plane behind us on the runway
and we are on a tight schedule.

892
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,862
I bet I can find a hole in that
tight schedule.

893
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,767
Red Eye to Cleveland last week.

894
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,102
Sex on the airplane. That happens.

895
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:39,809
Excuse me.

896
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,944
I think we all realized
what he was talking about.

897
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,172
Okay, alright, alright.

898
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,912
Jerry, you are such an idiot ...

899
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,581
- Hello?
- Leave me alone!

900
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,315
- Who is this?
- Andy, thank God!

901
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,914
Herman and.. Tiffany.. 
Nobodies answered my calls.. just..

902
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,821
God, I'm such an idiot.

903
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:01,124
- Vanessa, are you alright?
- Andy, come on. We must go.

904
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,132
- Excuse me, you're not supposed to use the cell.
- Thank you. Thank you.

905
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:06,202
- We gotta' go.
- Hold on, a second.

906
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,328
Luke is such an asshole. He set me up.

907
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,201
This isn't the producer's house.

908
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,208
Some frat party, they want me to strip.. and..

909
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,245
- You know what, I'm not gonna' do it anymore.. I just..
- Calm down..

910
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,179
Oh God they're gonna break down the door, Andy please!

911
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,749
Hello? Vanessa, are you o..?

912
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,749
Vanessa?! Hello..?

913
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,149
- Andy, we gotta go, bud.
- Shit. Shit.

914
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,089
- I gotta' go.
- No.

915
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,555
- Yes, yes, I gotta' go.
- What are you talkin' about?

916
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,422
- Vanessa is in real trouble.
- Vanessa got plenty of other fuck buddies that she can call.

917
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,088
You get on the plane,
you get one the plane. You cover, you know the whole thing.

918
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,893
- You know what, I'm just gonna count to three ...
- This is a real emergency.

919
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,433
One ..

920
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,866
- Two..
- I'm sorry, Jerry, I gotta go.

921
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,232
three..

922
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,598
four..

923
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,099
Urgh, fuck!

924
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,745
- Yeah?
- Hey, how are you?

925
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,840
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm here for the party, man.

926
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,986
- Hey, hey, where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the show, buddy.

927
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,650
Ralph.

928
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,455
This guy says he's part of the show.
Do you know anything about this?

929
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,928
Man, I don't know anything about that.

930
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,760
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph..

931
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,630
It's a surprise, buddy. You're gonna love it, trust me.

932
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,727
Wait until you see my cock.

933
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,068
You can tell your grandkids stories about it. 
Seriously.

934
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,307
- Where's the girl?
- That way.

935
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,408
What the hell..?

936
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,565
Vanessa, it's me. It's Andy.

937
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:55,076
Andy, these guys won't let me leave.. 
they're so pissed off..

938
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,146
they want me to strip and.. I'm not gonna do that..

939
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,010
- Hey, hey. Give me a minute here, okay?!
- I'm just.. I'm not gonna' do that anymore

940
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,742
You know, I've been working so hard and 
I've finally thought I earned something good.. you know?..

941
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,754
but guess what, this whole thing was a big "fuck you"

942
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:09,053
Calm down, calm down. Sshh. Look at me, look at me.

943
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,753
Breathe, alright? Breathe.

944
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,696
- I'm here now.
- Okay.

945
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,360
What does that mean?

946
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,260
I don't know.

947
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,668
Who wants to see a show?

948
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,711
Who wants to see a show, huh?

949
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:36,316
Good. Enough of that.

950
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,649
Alright, I see a lot of guys in this room..

951
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,155
who needs to get laid, am I right?!

952
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,561
- Ernie. Ernie.
- Okay, here's what I need you guys to do..

953
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,688
is to form a semi-circle
right here in the middle of the room..

954
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,767
with a clear path right thru' the middle.

955
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:55,929
Ralph, Ralph! When I give you the que
I need you to turn off the lights.

956
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:59,667
But wait, how are we gonna' see anything?

957
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,942
It's glow-in-the-dark-pussy!!!

958
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:08,248
That's exactly what it is! That's right.

959
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,451
It's me.

960
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,217
- Ready?
- What do we do?

961
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,950
You stay right behind me.

962
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,693
Yea! Alright, alright!

963
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,891
Ralph, turn off the lights!

964
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,032
Ralph.

965
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,205
Oh.. yeah!

966
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,852
What happening, guys?

967
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,887
Where's the music?!

968
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,918
Get in the car. Get in the car!

969
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,022
Assholes!

970
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,108
Tiffany?

971
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,010
Left.

972
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,282
Bedroom?

973
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,410
Too far!

974
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,828
Krav Maga, the Israeli martial art.

975
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:44,729
What?

976
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,396
Shalom, motherfucker.

977
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,139
Good morning, sunshine.

978
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:54,343
I have a shotgun pointed at your balls, right now.

979
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,843
I know that I messed up..

980
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:59,005
real bad, but if
anyone could've pitched 'em..

981
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:00,947
I mean, you killed it, right?

982
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:04,578
You suck.

983
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,051
Jerry, you're killing me here. Come on.

984
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,955
- Why didn't the balls get on the plane?
- What?

985
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,788
Bloom kept yelling that, "Why didn't the Balls get on the plane?"

986
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,625
We can't do this without the balls
in the operation. The plane never even took off, man.

987
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,426
It took all my charm
to save the account.

988
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,532
We still have a shot.

989
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,071
If, we are to stay
friends, and if, we're gonna stay a team..

990
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,298
and somehow
pull off this last chance pitch.

991
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,376
- You gotta' make me a couple promises.
- Anything.

992
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,708
- We have two days until the old man comes down here to hear this pitch.
- He's comin'.. He's coming here?

993
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,782
Dinki Donuts, my friend. Dinki Donuts.

994
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,541
I need you to live and breathe
Dinki Donuts..

995
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,347
I need your complete focus and dedication..

996
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,184
so that we can redeem ourselves and get this
account back. Say it with me..

997
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,123
- Dinki Donuts.
- Dinki Donuts, yes, Alright I get it.

998
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:46,252
That's done.. done. What else? What's the next thing?

999
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,887
The freaks.
I want them out of your life.

1000
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,230
- Andy?
- I.. pinky swear.

1001
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,107
Well.. That includes firing Relish the second we step foot on the office today.

1002
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:00,400
This needs Cumin.

1003
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,580
Cumin.

1004
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,708
Knock, knock. Heh, sorry.

1005
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,548
Hey, friend. Andy,
can I talk to you for a second?

1006
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,951
Okay, thank you.

1007
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:20,024
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Yea, I need to talk to you too, Donny. Please, let me go first..

1008
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,529
Vanessa told us what happened last night. Okay?

1009
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,826
There was a big blow up at the
meeting. Lots of drama.

1010
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,994
Two factions formed, okay?
Pro-and anti-Andy.

1011
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,604
Now..

1012
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,641
Couple people.. Tiffany, Franny.. they want you out..

1013
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:36,405
me and Ramon are lobbying for some sort of, a probation period..

1014
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,243
in which.. Herman thinks it's gonna blow over in a couple of weeks.

1015
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,577
- That's good.
- But in the meantime..

1016
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,447
good news: he's agreed to work with you one on one.

1017
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,578
What? No, no, no. I don't want that. No.

1018
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,656
Tell him thank you for me, but I really am not interested. Okay?

1019
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,815
- Tell him yourself.
- What does that mean?

1020
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,355
- How's you hanging, dude?
- Oh God, I work here.

1021
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,159
Herman this is where I work, I work here,
you cannot be here right now.

1022
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,899
To quote my first sponsor..

1023
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,765
"I'm not going anywhere, lard ass. Not without my friend."

1024
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,065
I don't want you to help me. I really don't want you to help me. Please.

1025
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,537
Or you. No one. Really, yeah.

1026
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,938
- What do you want?
- What I want? To be honest with you?

1027
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,670
I want my
old life back. I just want my old life back.

1028
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:13,579
- Yeah? Yea?
- Sorry, we can't let that happen. No.

1029
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:14,442
- Why?
- Why?

1030
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,577
You are one of the greatest people I've ever met in my life.

1031
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,085
- Okay, good.
- If it weren't for this job..

1032
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,815
I'd be lying in the gutter,
making maps of Hawaii on my stomach.

1033
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,017
You've helped us all, Andy.

1034
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,321
We need you, the group needs you.

1035
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,226
- You're the greatest person in the world.
- Can we.. can we just discuss this please?

1036
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,362
Oh.. God. Oh my God, that hurts so much.

1037
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,432
Hey, what did you want to talk with me about?

1038
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,207
Oh.. yeah! You suck!

1039
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,903
You're getting beat by a girl. You suck!

1040
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:48,541
Hi!

1041
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:51,386
- Hey, Andy.
- Andy, hey.

1042
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,284
What's up, man? Grab the guitar, we need the rhytm.

1043
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,947
Vanessa, what are you doing here?

1044
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,355
- Hang on, just give me a sec.
- Go, go.

1045
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:01,461
Nice!

1046
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,566
I called to talk to you, Jerry answered the phone,
he invited me over, said you'll be right back.

1047
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,933
Oh, that's nice.

1048
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,769
I just came here to tell you that it's my
my problem, it's not yours..

1049
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,172
you know people loves you in the group..

1050
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,268
and it would be selfish of me to deny that.

1051
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,813
After what happened, the other night..

1052
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,472
I kinda' got it out of my system ..

1053
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,915
you know this.. the steam has been released. So to speak.

1054
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,750
I'm happy to say Andy, that I've lost my attraction to you.

1055
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,619
I'm not attracted to you anymore.

1056
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:32,058
Oh, and your friend.. he's so great.

1057
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,254
I mean, you are right, great guy.

1058
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,055
I've got a great idea. Great idea.

1059
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,600
- Let's go to the warehouse for some brunch.
- I love the warehouse.

1060
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:40,796
Oh, it's a date!

1061
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,903
- What?
- "I'm finished with this perverts..

1062
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,532
they are out of my life. You have my words. "

1063
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,578
- Liar.
- You better not bring up your freakin' credo, you understand.

1064
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,442
- Hey, you coming too, Andy?
- Yeah.

1065
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:52,878
Let's go!

1066
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,552
- Hurm, oh my God. You should try this.
- Oh, yeah?

1067
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:07,193
Right?

1068
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,457
You speak Spanish right, Andy?

1069
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,229
No.

1070
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,731
God, Barcelona.
It feels like another lifetime ago.

1071
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,540
- Have you ever been to Spain?
- No.

1072
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:52,733
Oh my God, Andy, you have to go..

1073
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,901
The first time I fell in love, I was in Spain.

1074
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:55,875
Me too.

1075
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,769
- Yea?
- Yea.

1076
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,474
- Did your story have a happy ending?
- No. Of course not, does yours?

1077
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:01,845
She wanted to get married.

1078
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,810
Oh my God, is this the girl
that you were gonna marry ...

1079
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,549
and then she ended up sleeping with
the guy from the gym...?

1080
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,056
That I was gonna marry?

1081
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:16,123
Urm.. Are you thinking of err...?

1082
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,600
- Am I talking out of school here?
- No, no ...

1083
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:23,138
You know what, I'm an open book. 
My whole life is on speaker phone. Ask Andy.

1084
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,867
All of life's secrets I wear them
on my sleeve, look at that.

1085
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:29,103
- What do you wanna know?
- God, I mean, how do you get over something like that?

1086
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,980
Urm.. Look, I'm not gonna lie. When
I'm in a relationship...

1087
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,050
I.. I lose myself. You know?

1088
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:40,714
I can toward my personality to become the person
I think that the women wants me to be.

1089
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,620
It's a huge recipe for failure.

1090
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:46,388
And of course, Andy, you know he's 
my friend and everything but ...

1091
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,157
he doesn't understand.. he has no sympathy for that..

1092
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,892
with his one night stand and his conquest and stuffs...

1093
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,163
He actually thinks I'm spineless, but you know what..

1094
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,830
- I'm a romantic.
- There's nothing wrong with that.

1095
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,463
- Thank you. Want more Mimosa?
- Please.

1096
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:02,135
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh hey!

1097
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,907
Hey, look who it is. Eva and Inge, right?

1098
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,709
Oh hey, how're you doin'? Take care.

1099
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,284
We are on a layover from Frankfurt..

1100
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,080
we're going to Australia.

1101
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,883
We love it at the down under. It's really good.

1102
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,957
Sounds really good.

1103
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,821
- This is a friend of ours, Vanessa.
- Hello.

1104
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:21,693
Hello. You know we really love Jerry, he is the best.

1105
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,892
- You remember Andy, right?
- How could I forget.

1106
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,729
Mr. "I don't care about you at all".

1107
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:29,964
Let me give you a little warning. Girl to girl.

1108
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,437
He says one things at dinner...

1109
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,237
but then it turns into a different story when
he gets into the bedroom.

1110
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:42,674
He has to know how humiliated I was.

1111
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,912
You are scum. Scum!

1112
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:52,960
Ally, you get these stuffs into the easels
left, center, right.

1113
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:54,086
Thank you.

1114
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:58,859
What are you doing?

1115
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,663
Vanessa is funny, man.

1116
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,601
Funny and hot, when you ever see that combination?

1117
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,370
Is that really Vanessa?

1118
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:08,034
I swear to God if you pull that
Don Juan shit with her...

1119
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:09,168
Relax...

1120
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:12,179
she just sent me a photo of
this great place in Barcelona...

1121
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,339
where all of the students used to hang out.

1122
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,382
- You've never even been to Spain.
- I know.

1123
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,979
Hey guys, come on, let's go. Lets' rock!

1124
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,317
Make it good. Let's go!

1125
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:26,359
Robots have always been
associated with the future, right?

1126
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,690
A bright future.

1127
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,492
And what's cools is that these
robots, are also "retro" looking...

1128
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,761
So it's futuristic and nostalgic at the same time.

1129
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,461
It's comfort food for the eyes.

1130
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,698
I give you Dinki Donuts new logo.

1131
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:41,508
Iconic, graphic, arresting.

1132
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,078
What do you think, Dad?

1133
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,206
Dinki Donuts are
robot fuels.

1134
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:47,976
They power these lean mean machines right here.

1135
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:49,051
Have you ever seen a fat robot?

1136
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,118
No.

1137
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,312
Fat robot? You just don't see that. Doesn't happen.

1138
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,889
- What do you think, Pop?
- I love it.

1139
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,286
- Question.
- Yes?

1140
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,725
Is it sexy enough for the 18-49s?

1141
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,491
- A valid question.
- Is it sexy enough?

1142
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:05,431
Are you kidding? This robot
couldn't be sexier.

1143
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,536
Do you know what I'm sayin'?

1144
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:11,004
I do that because we can
take these logo and these robot...

1145
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,540
and put 'em on a bunch of products...

1146
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,371
that you normally wouldn't be able
sell in the store.

1147
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:17,605
So you can get your donut counter, you got a
T-shirt, you got err.. you know, a keychain...

1148
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:21,114
- I'm sorry, gentlemen..
- Andy, Andy, stay with the product.

1149
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,913
Just one moment, I'll be right back.
Thank you very much.

1150
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,057
Err.. T-shirts, I was sayin'...

1151
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,194
What is it Donny? This better be huge.

1152
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:36,322
Don, whatever it is, it's gotta wait,
it's gotta wait. I'm sorry..

1153
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,161
I'm tense.

1154
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,769
I'm a volcano and I'm about to erupt.

1155
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,600
I need you to bottle it up. Okay, alright?

1156
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,334
And you can let it out, all over, in an hour.

1157
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,773
Alright? Good, we cool?

1158
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:53,840
I got the CCPJ and the CPO. Put Greenberg's mail in Greenfield's cubby and
I put the DHL slip in the Fedex overnight and the airborne guy picked it up.

1159
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:59,980
Listen. Listen to me. I am trying to save my career in there.
You understand what I'm talkin' about..

1160
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,521
I need you to take in some deep breathe, 
breathe, breathe, breathe.

1161
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,115
Good, good, good.

1162
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,989
Listen, we can talk about this in one hour. Alright?

1163
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,587
Don't do anything crazy. Alright?

1164
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,528
Let me talk to you about the box for a second.

1165
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,035
The box is not just a doughnut box but..

1166
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,435
it's also, the robot's head.

1167
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,701
- Hello.
- Sorry about that. I'm back!

1168
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,243
- Where are we?
- Err, I was just doing the box..

1169
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:25,906
- And we're gonna go to phase 2.
- Yes, phase 2, that's very.. very exciting.

1170
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:29,348
That's where we began to introduce the doughnuts
and the robots themselves as movie stars ...

1171
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,079
by doing a series of movie posters spoofs...

1172
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:32,745
like this one from "The Shawshanks Redemption"...

1173
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:35,517
where we had the doughnuts raining down on the muscular robot.

1174
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,558
Owh, that's very clever.

1175
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,922
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1176
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,189
And the first one we're going to be ... starting with erm..

1177
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,128
- Call Security!
- ... erm.. "The Matrix" ...

1178
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,961
That's disgusting! What are you doing?!

1179
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,730
"The Matrix". We all know, imagine the robot ...

1180
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,136
- he's down like this and doughnuts ...
- I'm so sorry.

1181
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,403
Time me, time me. I'll be right
back, gentlemen.

1182
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,738
Nothing to worry about.

1183
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,346
Be right back!

1184
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,174
"The Godfather."

1185
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:07,255
Donny.

1186
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,562
Jesus Donny, you're gonna get me fired.

1187
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,530
- Holy fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

1188
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,766
Oh, God. This is strike 3.

1189
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,600
I'm going to jail for a real long time, Andy.

1190
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:26,638
Is that liquid..?

1191
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:30,041
Yeah, I used "liquid paper"
because I know it was a mistake.

1192
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,309
Alright, Alright!..

1193
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,144
first of all, will you pull your pants up, please!

1194
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,945
I can't talk to you with your pants down. Alright?

1195
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,044
And let's just clean this up.. Alright?

1196
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:40,856
I'm so sorry.

1197
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,021
I didn't mean for it to happen like this.

1198
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:45,491
Oh, shit!

1199
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:46,390
What?

1200
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,190
Right in there, in the copy room.

1201
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:52,256
God.. fuck. Please man. Please. What do we do?
I don't want to go there.

1202
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:55,860
Just get.. get out, run, run! Go.

1203
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,041
- I'm so sorry.
- Run!

1204
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,969
Freeze! Let me see your hands!

1205
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,415
Once again, I bet on the wrong guy.

1206
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:12,248
What is wrong with me?

1207
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,948
I don't know. You deserve better.

1208
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,422
- I just...
- What?

1209
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,426
He was doing better, wasn't he?

1210
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,358
Yea, it's a disease, Vanessa.

1211
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:24,159
It's very sad.

1212
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,291
I'm just glad that I can be here for ya'.

1213
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,435
Oh. Sorry to make you wait
while I do my Cardio.

1214
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,169
I am addicted.

1215
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,973
Oh, sweaty mcleaty. More Merlot?

1216
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,407
Yea.

1217
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,578
I hope I don't stink too bad for ya'.

1218
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,646
Wow.

1219
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,584
I'm gonna make you the best dinner on the planet.

1220
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,284
- You like penne?
- Yeah.

1221
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,592
Hand on one second.

1222
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,031
Hello?

1223
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,634
Jerry, it's me.

1224
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,966
- We got fired today.
- Look, I need you to come down and take...

1225
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,977
- Fired.
- Jerry?

1226
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:36,836
Oh, Vanessa.

1227
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:37,963
No, this is not Vanessa.

1228
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,877
- No, Jerry!
- What am I supposed to do, Andy?

1229
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:43,069
You never learn.

1230
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,680
I really feel like I'm enabling you.

1231
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,849
Let me ask you a question. 
Why did throw everything we worked for..

1232
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:50,782
down the toilet just to save some 
jerk-off you don't even know?

1233
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,250
I'll come get you in the morning.

1234
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,326
No, Jerry. I need you to come..

1235
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,125
God, no!

1236
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,296
I got these incredible truffles ...

1237
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,804
from a guy in Tuscany who went on a
truffle hunt..

1238
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,238
they follow pigs around..

1239
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:16,004
and the pigs smell
truffles underground...

1240
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,578
at the base of these oak trees.

1241
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,012
I mean, they're really-really expensive but...

1242
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,411
Oh, my God. Smell that.

1243
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,455
Just shave a little of them on top of
pasta, it's magic.

1244
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,818
That sounds so good.

1245
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,791
Oh no, it's not good. It's better than sex.

1246
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,163
So do you think we should call Andy
to make sure he's okay?

1247
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,928
That was actually Andy that called earlier. 
I didn't want to upset you.

1248
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,334
He's got to spend the night in jail. 
They're not letting him out.

1249
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,635
Oh my God. That's awful.

1250
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,370
Yea, yeah, but hopefully this is rock bottom.

1251
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:52,843
He's gonna be stronger for this.

1252
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,379
I can't tell you how much
this means to me...

1253
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:05,586
what you did, and.. and I want you to know 
that I'm gonna' get my shit together...

1254
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,958
from now on,
I keeping it in my pants.

1255
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,690
- Good.
- It's a promise.

1256
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,562
Oh my God. She's angry.

1257
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,231
Listen, whatever you need,
in the middle of the night...

1258
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,397
I'm highest peak, you pick up the phone...

1259
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,997
- Donny...
- Yea..

1260
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,571
Can you just.. drive me home?

1261
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,976
I don't drive.

1262
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:26,840
You know that.

1263
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,113
No. I did not know that.

1264
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,085
Should we call somebody?

1265
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:36,788
Okay, this is me.

1266
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,321
Okay, great. Thanks for the ride.

1267
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,956
Hey, I guess I see you guys at the group or...

1268
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:48,898
You're going in the wrong direction.

1269
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,904
- We're goin' to my place.
- Is Vanessa there?

1270
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,197
Oh God.

1271
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,105
Vanessa?

1272
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,569
Vanessa?

1273
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,880
Where is she?

1274
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,443
She's right here.

1275
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:10,290
Right?

1276
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,589
Yea, those truffles are incredible.

1277
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,061
I told you.

1278
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,564
How did you learn to cook like that?

1279
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:20,761
Well..

1280
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,398
when my fiancee left...

1281
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,408
the food network was my only friend.

1282
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:30,744
You feeling any better?

1283
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:36,373
I don't know if I'm better but, drunker for sure.

1284
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,612
Well I know how to make you feel better.

1285
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,449
You just gotta trust me.

1286
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,625
You do trust me? Dont ya?

1287
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:48,957
I don't know.

1288
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:50,656
Come on. You can trust me.

1289
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,166
I'm certified in Reflexology.

1290
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,137
I need you to sit up here. Okay?

1291
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:00,802
Come on.

1292
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,344
Sit up here.

1293
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,582
I don't know if you like it but..

1294
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,856
I love giving a good foot massage.

1295
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:22,353
Wait, hold.. slow down for a second..

1296
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,894
Oh, you're in for a treat tonight.

1297
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,501
Yes, that's right.

1298
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,974
I haven't eaten for 100 days and..

1299
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:12,137
Momma is hungry. Hehe.

1300
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:16,380
You're my little banana sundae...

1301
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,816
that right, that's it..

1302
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,483
there we go, that's it!..

1303
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,852
Oh~ Squirm..

1304
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,550
there we go...

1305
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,753
that we go and a pupu.

1306
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,762
The pupu, the pupu.

1307
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,458
Just a minute. Want some
chocolate in your vanilla?

1308
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,258
You want some chocolate in your vanilla?

1309
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,633
Super Bowl.

1310
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:45,872
Here we go, now. Here we go, now.

1311
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,814
Here we go, now. Here we go, now.

1312
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,782
Yes, 15...

1313
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,356
75... 43...

1314
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,424
Hut! Hut!

1315
01:14:56,525 --> 01:15:02,496
Yes, as a retuércete
lizard in a skillet. And a 100 day!

1316
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,525
Oh.. my.. God!

1317
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,470
Get off of me, you bastard.

1318
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:11,766
He came here lookin' for you ...

1319
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,068
and when he couldn't find you ...

1320
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,075
he just ravaged me ...

1321
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,407
then he made me put on this outfit...

1322
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:20,506
That is not what happen. At all!

1323
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:21,844
Get out of here, Andy.

1324
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,941
She attacked me. Alright?

1325
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,451
You gotta believe me.

1326
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,852
I would never do
anything to hurt you, come on you know that.

1327
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:30,149
Really? Really?!

1328
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,987
Is that why you told
Jerry all about me?

1329
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,790
Taught him how to get me in bed?

1330
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:36,659
What happened?

1331
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,458
He's a great lay.

1332
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,366
Is it what you want to hear?

1333
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,676
No. Vanessa, please...

1334
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,638
Get out of here.

1335
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,011
Get out of here.

1336
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,811
Get out of my life.

1337
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,921
I never wanna see you again. Do you hear me?

1338
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,182
Go!

1339
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,645
You slept with her?

1340
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,343
Jesus, what, they locked you up at "Ben & Jerry"?

1341
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,285
I can't fucking believe you!

1342
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:35,981
And I can't fucking believe you.

1343
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,649
I mean every time I have to fix your fucking mess.

1344
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,489
Same thing I had to do with Cynthia.

1345
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,822
Cynthia?

1346
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,661
What.. what do you mean fix? What does that mean?

1347
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,665
What do you think it means?

1348
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,133
She was gonna move you to Boston,
break up the team...

1349
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:49,726
and I was going to allow that to happens? No way!

1350
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,735
You're the guy from the gym?

1351
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,706
You're just now figuring this out?

1352
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,206
Get out of my life!

1353
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,721
I know...

1354
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:15,894
we need furniture.

1355
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,064
That's good.

1356
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:28,400
Stay away!

1357
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,308
Jesus, Herman, you scared the shit out of me.

1358
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,075
She's back with Luke, 
she's stripping full time in Jumbo's ...

1359
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,013
- And it's your fault.
- You people are unbelievable.. you don't want me around..

1360
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,585
but you won't leave me alone.

1361
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:39,584
Well you had other options, motherfucker.

1362
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,679
You could have come to the Rock
instead of jerking off...

1363
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,724
going to the jail, sell out Vanessa..

1364
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,224
and  then "desserting" Tiffany.

1365
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,021
" Dessert " Tiffany?

1366
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,188
Was it "Chocolate? "Nuts?

1367
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,163
Alright, alright, "desserting", yeah!

1368
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,133
- That's right, you know it, motherfucker.
- I get it.

1369
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,068
Stay away.

1370
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,469
Jesus, Herman!

1371
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:06,302
Jerry?

1372
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:10,079
Jerry?

1373
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,312
[ iSight, iSaw, iConquered ]

1374
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:44,852
Oh no.

1375
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,011
Just a minute, just a minute.

1376
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,056
- No, no, no, I'm here for you.
- I don't want this anymore.

1377
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:25,126
- What?
- I can't, I can't do it.

1378
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:27,127
- I changed my mind. Okay?
- I know, I know. Andy told me.

1379
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:30,096
- Don't worry.
- Andy told you what?

1380
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:33,565
- What Andy told you?
- Just, you know what we call "triggers"..

1381
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,329
- Things that gets you on.
- Oh my God.

1382
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,428
You know, don't worry about it, 
I don't think there's anything wrong with you.

1383
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,973
- You're disgusting.
- I'm disgusting?

1384
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,066
- I'm just trying to protect my friend.
- Protect him?

1385
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:43,974
Yes he needs to know what kind of person you really are.

1386
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,842
You're wasting his time, you know that?

1387
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,575
- I don't want you to hurt him.
- What kind of person are you? Hurt him?

1388
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:53,484
How could I hurt him? I love him, you asshole!

1389
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:31,385
Fuck off.

1390
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,563
- You okay, Vanessa?
- Can you just hand me my stuffs please.

1391
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,457
- Call me if you need me.
- Thanks.

1392
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,963
- Where do you think you're going?
- I just quit, genius.

1393
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:46,097
Baby, we need the money.
How many times we're gonna go through this?

1394
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:49,072
This will be the last time.

1395
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,667
- Whoo.. whoo..
- Stop it!

1396
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:53,178
- Get your ass, back on that stage.
- Just let me go. Okay? Luke?

1397
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,613
- Hey, hey, hey Vanessa, come on..
- Andy, get out of here.

1398
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,151
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Stop. Andy, go.

1399
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:01,586
- I thought said I don't want to see you again.
- Hands off her, asshat.

1400
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,150
Oh my God.

1401
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,352
Get up!

1402
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:15,130
Damn, it!

1403
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,374
Vanessa!

1404
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,858
He came on to my shit.

1405
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:14,520
And I went on a hundred days... 
more than a hundred days..

1406
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,597
without any action, Burton.

1407
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,258
But it was like there's a hurricane
went off in my brain.

1408
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,301
There was cows and they were flying and shit..

1409
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,166
there was Dorothy and there was a lot of shit..

1410
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,572
I was vulnerable...

1411
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,803
and he took advantage of me.

1412
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,811
Well, Tiffany welcome back.

1413
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:35,041
Think of this as your first day.

1414
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:38,313
Are you willing to walk down that road with all of us?

1415
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,113
- Just say "Yes I am."
- Yes, I am.

1416
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,481
I'm very proud of you.

1417
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,625
Can we help you?

1418
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,928
Sorry to interrupt.

1419
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:55,367
Err, Vanessa, can I talk to
you for a second outside, please?

1420
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,961
Why don't you tell us what
you're gonna tell Vanessa?

1421
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,563
This is a no secrets zone.

1422
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:02,543
I'd really rather talk in private.

1423
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,044
Ya, I know big boy, but you don't have an option.

1424
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,178
Fine. Fine.

1425
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,639
I'll just say it and go.

1426
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:15,522
I'm a liar. Okay?

1427
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,557
I lied to you.

1428
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:20,059
And to Burton, and then to Rock...

1429
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,391
Donny, Tiffany, Franny...

1430
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:26,831
- Ramon.
- Yes, Ramon and to all the rest of you... yes..

1431
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:29,028
but worst than that though, I lied to myself.

1432
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:33,100
I err.. I got problems. Alright?

1433
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,403
Believe me. But...

1434
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,909
I don't have your problem.

1435
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,809
I lied about that too.

1436
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:42,181
I pretended to be a sex addict..

1437
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:44,217
because I wanted to get close to someone..

1438
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:47,220
who I fell in love with the second that I first saw her.

1439
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,946
You, Vanessa.

1440
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:54,657
If I had just been honest
with you from the beginning..

1441
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,061
I really think that you would have liked me..

1442
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:58,291
for me.

1443
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,327
And that's it.

1444
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:05,132
I said it.

1445
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:09,632
Andy.

1446
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:15,916
For months, I've been talking about 
how ready I am to meet a decent guy.

1447
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:19,052
But since I have this problem..

1448
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:22,920
I wouldn't recognize a decent guy
if he was right in front of me.

1449
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,988
Well, I'm looking right at you, Andy.

1450
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:29,729
I am.

1451
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:32,392
And I wanna believe you..

1452
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,728
so much.

1453
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,761
But I don't even know who you are.

1454
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,168
I know who he is.

1455
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:45,146
He is a man, that
when I was down...

1456
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:48,044
and I was about to sodomize a
hooker in my van ...

1457
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:49,343
and he saved me.

1458
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,246
That's that man.

1459
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,817
Ya, I know that man.

1460
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:57,881
That man there got fired and went
to jail for me ...

1461
01:24:57,992 --> 01:24:58,890
that man.

1462
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,823
I attacked him. Not the other way around.

1463
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,732
Fuck, you all know I'm sick.

1464
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:09,895
That's why we're here.

1465
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,029
Now, that is sweet , attagurl.

1466
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,767
- Can hardly believe it.
- Big surprise.

1467
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,308
That is quite a resume, young man.

1468
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:19,510
You know, like I said, I do anything to fit in.

1469
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:24,843
But you're right, you don't
know me at all.

1470
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,920
So what about we just start over?

1471
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:30,613
My name is Andy.

1472
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:33,057
- Hi, Andy.
- No..

1473
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:35,358
this time without you guys.

1474
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:40,423
Hi.

1475
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,262
I'm Andy.

1476
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,205
Girl, don't miss out.

1477
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,039
Go.

1478
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:02,117
Vanessa.

1479
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,159
You're not gonna shake my hand?

1480
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,458
I'm not gonna touch you for the next hundred days.

1481
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,693
Oww, celibacy pledge.

1482
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:15,234
How romantic is that.

1483
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,804
No touching for a hundred days. That's so damn stupid.

1484
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,268
It's appropriate.

1485
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:21,600
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1486
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,110
- One hundred days?
- Can you handle that?

1487
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:28,943
Yeah.

1488
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:35,055
My name is Jerry, I'm a sex addict.

1489
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:37,522
- Jerry, what are you doing?
- I know, I gotta do this, I gotta do this.

1490
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:40,287
Andy is not the villain here, I am. I am.

1491
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,828
- What?
- Yeah, oh yeah.

1492
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,421
We were best friends and what did I do,
I slept with his fiancee ...

1493
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:45,590
six weeks before the wedding.

1494
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,463
Six weeks!

1495
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:50,003
- You don't have to do this.
- Hey. What's wrong with your face?

1496
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:51,765
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

1497
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,500
Listen, listen I'm just getting started.

1498
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:56,634
And now he's fallen in love
this beautiful woman right here...

1499
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:58,575
- And what did I do? What did I do?
- What did you do?

1500
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,044
- What?
- What did you do?

1501
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:01,773
I tried to seduce her.

1502
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:05,751
Yea, yeah. I got problems. I got big problems.

1503
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:06,820
Hello, Turquoise.

1504
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,151
Oh my God. Oh my God!

1505
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:11,817
See, he thought.. that..

1506
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:13,791
if he was more like me ...

1507
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:14,953
that he would have better luck with you.

1508
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,827
That's why he's been hanging out 
will all you perverts.

1509
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:18,657
Come on.

1510
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,429
And all the sexual talks that
he's been saying..

1511
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,969
all these crazy stories,
they're my stories.

1512
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,266
He got no game. He's got no game.

1513
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,897
Trust me. It was me.

1514
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:29,500
You gotta believe him.

1515
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,076
I do.

1516
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:40,183
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1517
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,256
Are you the mayor of Pussy Town?

1518
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,222
- You're my hero.
- Yeah.

1519
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,418
- Yea, yea.
- Come on and sit down.

1520
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:50,296
- Do you wanna...?
- Yes.

1521
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,423
- I didn't catch your name when you err...
- I'm Jerry.

1522
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:54,364
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hi.

1523
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:56,960
Alright, this is the place to purge. 
Go ahead. Spit it out.

1524
01:27:57,071 --> 01:27:59,505
- I've been chasing the beef since I was 10.
- Really?

1525
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:02,940
Yeah, for my bar mitzvah, my aunt
gave me a golden pen ...

1526
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,841
- And a rimmer.
- Holy ma...

1527
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,777
- Yea.
- That's amazing..

1528
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:09,577
Keep talking. Squeeze it out. Here we go.
