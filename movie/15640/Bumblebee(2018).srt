00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,065
I know a rebel would gladly follow
their leader without questioning.

164
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,832
So where is he?

165
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:36,665
My name is Cliff-jumper.
Leutinent of the autobot ressistance.

166
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,699
My sabertron...

167
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,299
Wrong answer!

168
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,599
We know he is planning to
estabilish a base.

169
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:47,299
Tell us where and
we'll let you live.

170
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,665
My name is Cliffjumper and...

171
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:56,599
No!

172
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,832
That's B-127's signal.

173
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,732
- Can you trace it?
- I already did.

174
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,932
If you don't tell where prime is,
Perhaps your young friend will.

175
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:09,581
- Never!
- You're a brave warrior.

176
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:12,632
I mean, you deserve
a better death.

177
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,232
But then again...

178
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,056
No!

179
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,499
Set course for earth.

180
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,799
I'll give you 30 bucks
for all of it.

181
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,732
I'll get twice as much
for the coil alone.

182
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,732
From who? I'm the only
one that comes in here.

183
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,332
I mean, I don't know
how you're still open.

184
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,632
Just take it. Go, go.
My show is on.

185
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,965
Hey, where did you
get that beetle?

186
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,814
I swear to god, ever since they
put up that dumb-ass tower,

187
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:56,238
...I cant get a signal to
watch my shows.

188
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:58,899
I gotta see what happens to
<i>ALF</i> this week.

189
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,732
Come on!

190
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:25,189
Arg!

191
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,032
Are you kidding me?

192
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,332
Damn it.

193
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,465
I give up.

194
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,665
I can't do this without you.

195
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:49,414
...

196
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,599
Happy Birthday.

197
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,565
I miss you, dad.

198
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,755
- I think it's too low, honey.
- No.

199
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:52,465
- No, I think it's goes to that button.
- Yeah?

200
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,470
Yeah. I'm... No.

201
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:56,832
Except... Hey.

202
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,832
- Good morning, birthday girl.
- Hi!

203
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,977
You look...

204
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,275
...nice.

205
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:06,999
Happy Birthday, baby.
I Love you.

206
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,665
Come on, Open your present.
I'm gonna be late for work.

207
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:12,465
Thanks, Mom.

208
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:20,299
Helmet?
With Daffadils.

209
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:24,472
So I keep hearing about people
on mopeds getting run over..

210
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:27,899
...and their brain smashed in.
You gotta wear this from now on.

211
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,999
I don't care if it's not the law.
It's our law.

212
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:32,965
Plus, look how cute it is.

213
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:37,865
- Yeah.
- Happy Birthday.

214
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,399
I actually got a little
gift to you, charilie.

215
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:43,399
I mean, It's small, but
it's from my heart.

216
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,032
[Smile for a change]

217
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,699
A smile is a powerful thing.

218
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,665
It releases endorphins.

219
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,232
It's sense to to the world
"unfun and approchable".

220
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,632
You know, there is a
whole chapter in here

221
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,156
about how people
smile more often

222
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:06,256
actually have more friends.

223
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,032
It's unbelieveble.

224
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:10,131
I really think it's gonna
change your whole life

225
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:11,856
if you give a smile
more often.

226
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,098
I want the beetle.

227
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:33,632
- What?
- The yellow beetle, I want it.

228
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,132
I'll make you a deal.
If I get that thing started, its fine.

229
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,999
That's no deal.
That's just you taking my car.

230
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:42,765
If I can start it, I keep it and... and
I work here every day for a year.

231
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,793
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

232
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,107
I'll pick up and organize every
scrap of paper in this place.

233
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,765
I'll even detail your horrible,
disgusting toilets.

234
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:56,232
Please. It's my birthday.

235
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,565
Sorry, no deal.

236
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,199
'Cause we ain't hiring.

237
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:04,999
It's yours, kid.
Happy birthday.

238
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,399
Thank you!

239
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,132
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!

240
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,465
And my toilets are gorgeous.

241
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,765
God, please.

242
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,665
Come on.

243
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,032
Oh my...
Oh my God!

244
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,532
Oh, my god! Thank you so much!
I love you!

245
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,899
That thing ain't
even safe to drive.

246
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,932
It's a death trap.

247
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,432
She's happy though.

248
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,632
It was amazing.

249
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:54,899
What?

250
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,299
Oh my God!

251
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:18,989
Charlie, what was that noise?

252
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,399
Nothing! Mom, you should go back to bed!
Everything is fine.

253
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,732
- What the hell is that?
- A... It's...

254
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:26,685
What is that car
doing in our garage?

255
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:28,309
Car?

256
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,032
Oh, that car?

257
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,332
That's my car.

258
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,365
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

259
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,732
It runs, yeah.

260
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:40,465
Those aren't safe!

261
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,799
I wish you would've told me
before you've brought it home.

262
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,523
Okay.
Sorry.

263
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:48,899
- I'm in the middle of some stuff.
- Okay, I'll get out of your hair, but...

264
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:53,772
Tell me things, sometime.
I'm your mother.

265
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:55,326
- Okay.
- Okay.

266
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:58,542
- Good night.
- It really runs?

267
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,299
- Yeah, It really... really runs.
- Cool.

268
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,632
Are you still in there?

269
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:21,832
Okay.
I'm little jumpy, I'm sorry.

270
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:33,432
Okay.

271
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,165
Hi!

272
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,932
God, are you...

273
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:18,732
Do you speak?

274
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:32,899
I won't hurt you.

275
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,965
Can you..understand me?

276
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,465
What are you?

277
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,232
Where did you come from?

278
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,765
Okay, okay.

279
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:23,999
You like my shirt?

280
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,799
Are you a metal fan?

281
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:27,799
No..wait..

282
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,665
Oh, who would me?

283
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,732
Who am I?

284
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,265
Oh, I'm...

285
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,332
...Charlie

286
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,532
Charlie Watson.
I'm... eighteen.

287
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:46,565
Today, actually,
it's my birthday today.

288
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:50,599
What's your name?

289
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:56,032
You... You don t know or
you don't have a name?

290
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:02,899
You sound like
a little bumblebee.

291
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,399
I'm gonna call you
that from now on.

292
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,365
Bumblebee.

293
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,765
It matches to
your outfit too.

294
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,265
I want a divorce, Roy!

295
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,132
Come on, Ann!
Well, give me one good reason!

296
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,232
You tried to sleep
with my sister!

297
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,832
Unsuccessfully!

298
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,799
Yeah! You're unsuccessful
at everything!

299
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,632
That damn payment was for
a house, you bought a car!

300
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:58,365
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car! God!

301
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,232
No, just settle down for one
second. Just hear me o...

302
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,799
- What the hell is that?
- What?

303
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:12,399
God, Roy, that thing is
coming right toward us!

304
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,032
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

305
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:16,232
Not my car!
Not my car!

306
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:18,545
Please, god! No!
Not my car!

307
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:30,965
Oh, thank god! My car...

308
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,199
Yeah, I'm okay.

309
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,832
Oh, that's good, baby.
That's good.

310
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,965
Ow!

311
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,632
Is that my car?

312
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:04,599
Hello...?

313
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,765
Jesus!

314
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,165
Earth.

315
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,515
- No! Wait!
- Hello!

316
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:24,855
How underwhelming!

317
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:28,265
The indigenous life is even more
primitive than I expected.

318
00:34:30,394 --> 00:34:31,592
Hey!

319
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:36,675
I liked the way they pop.

320
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,999
Focus, comrade.

321
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:43,565
B-127 is distress signal came from
the western coast of this continent.

322
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,832
For now, we head west.

323
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,832
When will they start
letting you use nunchucks?

324
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:04,332
I don' t know,
but I hope soon.

325
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:05,865
Good morning!
See you guys later.

326
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,732
Where are you off to so fast?

327
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:10,265
Nowhere.
Have a nice day!

328
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,765
Good morning, Bum...

329
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,732
Bee?

330
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,965
Bee, where are you?

331
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:27,699
God! Oh, god! Oh, god!
Bee!

332
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,465
Where did you go?

333
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,899
Otis!

334
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,467
Have you seen my car?

335
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:40,220
Unfortunately, yes

336
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,432
No, Otis, have you
seen my car today?

337
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,465
It was... It was... in the garage.
Someone's stole it!

338
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,365
No, idiot, mom took it.

339
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,884
Gonna bring Conan to the vet

340
00:35:47,908 --> 00:35:49,732
because he's swallowing
a rubber glove or something.

341
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,799
- And Ron needed the station wagon.
- Thanks God.

342
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,132
Wait!

343
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:04,409
- Alright.
- Excuse me. It's me again.

344
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,729
- We've never officially met...
- Yeah, I can't right now. Sorry.

345
00:36:06,753 --> 00:36:09,353
No, Yep. Ok... Okay.

346
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:15,865
I know, buddy,
hang in there.

347
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,565
You can't eat
everything you see.

348
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,399
Just let this be a good
life lesson for you.

349
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,765
Oh god, Bee. Stop it!
Don't do that!

350
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,065
Bee, no!

351
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,765
- Mom!
- Ah!

352
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,665
Jesus! Charlie,
what are you doing?

353
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,265
- Mom, you gotta pull over!
- What the hell is going on?

354
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,865
- Just pull the car over!
- Okay, okay.

355
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,732
Alright.

356
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,754
Would you put that
droughnut joke away?

357
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,299
What were you thinking?

358
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,189
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

359
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:02,099
I thought I was being car jacked.
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

360
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,365
I can't believe you were
taking him without me!

361
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,732
Mom, I'm so worried about him!
He's my dog too, you know.

362
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:10,365
What happened to
Conan being Otis's dog?

363
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:12,832
Mom, you're being
hysterical, okay?

364
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,938
You shouldn't be driving in
such an emotional stress.

365
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:16,962
I know how you get
during emergancies.

366
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:19,165
I'm a nurse.

367
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,699
Not of animals.

368
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,965
- Okay.
- Oh.

369
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,632
Okay. I'm happy for
you to drive.

370
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,432
You weren't wearing your
helmet, by the way, I saw that.

371
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:33,599
Oh, shoot!

372
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,799
Keep it together, Bee.

373
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,660
Sir!

374
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,832
Sir, I thought you would
want to see this immediatly.

375
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,365
They're sure?

376
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,599
Yes, sir. Two of them just
made contact in texas.

377
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:02,499
Intel says that they're
heading west fast.

378
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,765
Saddle up, simmons.

379
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,599
We're going to texas.

380
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,332
Okay, Bee. We need
to go over a few things.

381
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:19,165
Okay, we're all clear.

382
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,732
Alright!

383
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,699
What do you think
of the beach?

384
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:30,665
Oh! I'm... I'm good.
I'm... No, I'm good thanks.

385
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:36,632
Look, people can be terrible about
things they don't understand.

386
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:39,455
If they find you, they will probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere...

387
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:42,174
...and cut you into tiny
little pieces. It'll be...

388
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,965
...bad. Trust me.

389
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:52,065
Only person you can show
yourself around is me. Okay?

390
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,765
So, let's practice,
are you ready?

391
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,932
You see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

392
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:02,599
Great. Perfect.

393
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:04,665
Come back now.

394
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:07,121
Okay, so let's say we're driving, right?

395
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,353
We're driving in opposite and...
Oh! Shoot! Somebody is there.

396
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,377
Hide! Hide, Bee!
Hide!

397
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,165
Are you serious?

398
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,965
Bee, it's too late,
you're already dead.

399
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:37,865
It's alright.
It's more of a practicing.

400
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,099
You'll get it.

401
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,799
FOX-2 on approch.
Non-biologicals are inbound.

402
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,065
Our goal, sir, should be to
communicate with them.

403
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,632
First contact with an alien species.

404
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,999
I spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

405
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:14,399
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

406
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,932
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill some.

407
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:37,499
Not yet.
B-127's signal is gone silent.

408
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:39,465
I have an idea.

409
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,499
Listen up, I'm Agent Burns,
and this is Dr. Powell.

410
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:47,965
We currently have a hundred guns
pointed right at your head.

411
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,932
So, state your business.

412
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:56,022
People of earth, we're decepticon
peace keepers, patroling the galaxy.

413
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:57,666
Wait. What are you doing?

414
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,791
Oh! This is humiliating.

415
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:03,327
We believe a dangeorus
criminal from our world

416
00:41:03,352 --> 00:41:06,365
is hiding somewhere on yours.

417
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,265
How is it that you
think we can help?

418
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,332
We need your eyes.

419
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:16,532
Wait. You want to
access to our satellites?

420
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:19,065
Our scanner's range is limited.

421
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,465
Your infrastructure is primitive.

422
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,132
But combined, they
could be quite powerful.

423
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,865
No way! Out of the question.

424
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,632
We have a common
enemy, agent Burns.

425
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:33,299
There is a war raging
on our planet.

426
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:37,865
If B-127 isn't found, that
war may find it's way here.

427
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,699
Perhaps, we can find a way
one and another.

428
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,431
We'll talk it over with our superiors.

429
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:47,209
In the meantime...

430
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,732
- ...if you could follow us.
- Very well, friend Powell.

431
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:53,032
Take us to your leader.

432
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:06,332
It's sucked being couped up
in a VW all day, hah?

433
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:10,465
Is there.. Anyone
can help you?

434
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,132
Do you have a family?

435
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,032
You know, like
a mom, dad, siblings.

436
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,865
You all love each other.

437
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:20,997
Or drive each other
crazy and you can't

438
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:23,189
wait to get away and
start your own life.

439
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,299
Do you want me to
see if I could fix it?

440
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:35,699
I'll be gentle, I promise.

441
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,732
Wow!

442
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,232
You lay down, okay?

443
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:57,132
Hold still.

444
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,232
I think maybe there is something...

445
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:17,360
B-127, I pray this
message finds you...

446
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:21,932
...our war rages on.

447
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,765
...Planet earth.

448
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,765

449
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,165
Ravage, eject!

450
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:13,965
Your mission... soldier.

451
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:22,032
Are you okay?

452
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,965
Who was that?

453
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:29,165
That voice, he said something
about a... a... a war

454
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:31,899
Do you remember anything?

455
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:39,765
Is the VW beetle is
some kind of disguise?

456
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:42,499
Are you hiding from something?

457
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,265
Are you scared?

458
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:01,465
It's broken.

459
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,915
It's okay. Now I know
that I can help you.

460
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,399
Let's go home.

461
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,609
<i>And a basket case.
And a princess.</i>

462
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:19,599
Right, I'm almost done.

463
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:21,623
Is that answer
your question?

464
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,565
No way! Are you
actually watching it?

465
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,432
You can pop-in another
one, if you want.

466
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,032
[Charlie: Dive meet]

467

Come on, sweety!</i>

468
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,199
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

469
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:50,365

- Thanks, dad.</i>

<i>How do you feel?
You're amazing...</i>

474
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:01,365
No! Why would
you play this?

475
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,299
I... I'm Sorry, just...

476
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,399
I finished.

477
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,632
Let's see we got something.

478
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:19,332
Okay.

479
00:46:28,366 --> 00:46:30,132
Okay.

480
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:32,432
Alright.

481
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:39,399
Oh, my god! Yes!

482
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:41,365
It worked!

483
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,699
How do you know?

484
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:46,065
Man, you got some moves!

485
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:56,499
You know, Bee, music can
help us to say our feelings.

486
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:58,265
[The Smiths]

487
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,799
You're gonna love this.
It's brand new.

488
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,165
Not a smiths fan?

489
00:47:19,366 --> 00:47:21,899
Okay. Ahm...

490
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,882
Here.

491
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,618
Try this.

492
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,765
Fine.

493
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:37,649
Okay, next... Let's see.

494
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:42,332
Well, Joan jett & the Black Hearts...

495
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:45,032
Stones.

496
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:48,432
Hey! Hey, Hey, Please
don't touch those. Please.

497
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:55,065
They were belong to my dad.

498
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:17,165
Do you want to hear it?

499
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,799
We used to listend to this while
we were working on our corvette.

500
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:48,799
This was his favorite.

501
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:55,032
He used to say it would
make the car feel better.

502
00:49:05,866 --> 00:49:09,199
We used to work on this car
every weekend together.

503
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,199
It was our thing.

504
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:21,899
That tape...

505
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:28,665
That was the last
time I saw him.

506
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:34,032
He died of a heart attack.

507
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:38,032
And I never really
got to say goodbye.

508
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,232
You know, I always
thought if I could just...

509
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:46,965
...finish fixing his car.

510
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,399
If I could just give it
a start up again...

511
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:57,832
...he would hear me..

512
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,899
He would hear me.

513
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,232
I say this with
all due respect.

514
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:43,965
Have you lost
your damn mind?

515
00:50:43,966 --> 00:50:46,999
- That was with all due respect?
- The man's got a point, doctor.

516
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,465
Our satellite network is at the
forefront of our national defense.

517
00:50:50,466 --> 00:50:54,132
Sir, please. It could be a once
in a lifetime oppertunity.

518
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:58,032
Can you imagine the advances
these creatures might bring?

519
00:50:58,033 --> 00:51:01,099
Well. I imagine the advances!
An advance on washinton.

520
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,432
- New york! And advance on chicago.
- It's not gonna happen.

521
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:07,132
They literally call themselves
"dicepticons".

522
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:09,732
- That dosen't sound like red flag?
- Enough!

523
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,465
- From both of you.
- Sir..

524
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:16,588
We're talking about the most
advanced robotic system ever seen.

525
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:18,936
If we tell them no,

526
00:51:18,936 --> 00:51:22,338
they'll just take their technlogy
to the russians instead.

527
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,489
You really want to go down in history
as the man causes the cold war?

528
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,832
Fine.

529
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:34,932
We'll help them find
their fugutive.

530
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:40,232
And when it's done, you can do
all the experiments you want. Hm?

531
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,865
Yes, sir.

532
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:47,932
Gentle...
Ah... robots!

533
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:51,999
Welcome to sector seven.

534
00:51:52,033 --> 00:51:55,022
How kind of you to
finally allow us to in.

535
00:51:55,046 --> 00:51:57,046
We're very happy to
have you here.

536
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,065
- As friends.
- Thank you, friend Powell.

537
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:04,432
My superior has agreed to grant you
limited access to our satellites.

538
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:09,599
In addition, you're welcome to
use all of our technology here.

539
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,532
It's the largest super
way of crays on earth.

540
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:15,265
We thank you for your hospitality.

541
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:19,593
Tell me, those vocal
communication devices you use.

542
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:23,332
- Do they function worldwide?
- The telephones?

543
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:24,999
Yes, why?

544
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,922
You've gotta pick a station, man.
And I know there is lot of choices.

545
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,946
You want to go on a date
with me, maybe?

546
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,065
Okay...

547
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,265
- What are you trying to do?
- Here we go. Here we go.

548
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:46,071
You're not a nerd./////

549
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:48,885
Just... Okay, you're a nerd, but just
don't let her know you're a nerd.

550
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:50,909
Excuse me. Sorry to
barge at night, I just...

551
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:53,037
Hah?

552
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,110
Ahm!
You need to go!

553
00:52:57,134 --> 00:53:00,535
No! No, it's fine.
Just... Just sit down, please.

554
00:53:00,535 --> 00:53:02,232
Sh..., Just don't scream, okay?

555
00:53:02,256 --> 00:53:03,332
What is that?

556
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,688
It's ok. Try to just breath.
Breath.

557
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:09,032
- First of all, Hi.
- Hi.

558
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:10,699
I am Charlie.

559
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,332
I'm Memo. Hi.

560
00:53:12,366 --> 00:53:14,732
Hi, Memo. Ahm...

561
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:18,732
- It's nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to have...

562
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:22,699
I know what you saw,
it's a little crazy. I can explain.

563
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:26,216
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

564
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,884
If you told anyone
what you just saw,

565
00:53:27,908 --> 00:53:29,908
I'm gonna have to run
you over with my car.

566
00:53:32,499 --> 00:53:34,407
- Jeez!
- That was...

567
00:53:34,431 --> 00:53:36,431
No, I don't mean that
in a mean way, okay?

568
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:41,332
What I'm saying is no one can
know what you just saw. Okay?

569
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,399
You promise?

570
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:48,099
- Yeah.
- Okay.

571
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,132
Bumblebee, you can...
you can come out.

572
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,132
- It's a...
- He.

573
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,032
Wow.

574
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,756
He's been going up and down
on that dial all day today

575
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,780
and I don't know why.

576
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:22,565
Hey, check out he's reflexes.

577
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:26,132
Oh! Oh, god! Oh! Oh!

578
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:27,635
- Yo, give me your shirt.
- Hah?

579
00:54:27,635 --> 00:54:29,056
Give me your shirt!

580
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,310
You mean the shirt
that I'm wearing?

581
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:31,843
Yes, Yes. Come on!
I'll give it back to you.

582
00:54:31,867 --> 00:54:33,332
Okay.

583
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:35,565
Come on!
Give me your shirt!

584
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:42,365
Alright.

585
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:49,725
No! Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, no, no.

586
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:51,651
- You... you don't need to do this.
- Yes, I do.

587
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:53,832
- But we're not...
- come here!

588
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,799
- I get... I get it!
- Come on!

589
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,599
Sorry!

590
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:08,432
I know I promised to you but..
I cant give you that back.

591
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:30,623
It's incredible!

592
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:33,957
They're combining our
technologies seamlessly.

593
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:36,741
Satellites, phones, computers.

594
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:41,383
They're creating an inter-connected
web of information.

595
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:43,953
Volumes of data
at their fingertips.

596
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,132
It's revolutionary.

597
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:48,567
He's a weird guy.

598
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:52,093
They're tracking fluctuations
in energon levels.

599
00:55:52,093 --> 00:55:55,975
It's like a heat signature
specific to their species.

600
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:58,847
It's astonishing.
It's beautiful...

601
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,799
Hello? Hello?

602
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,832
You're giving them our satellites,
comms, god knows what else.

603
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:09,499
Yet, In a space of a day they
will be giving us enough data

604
00:56:09,523 --> 00:56:13,775
not only hunt down
B-127 but all of them.

605
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:18,965
Let them finish what they're doing.
Let them find B-127.

606
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,957
Then I'll give you permission
to destroy them all

607
00:56:22,563 --> 00:56:25,086
...for spare parts.

608
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,365
Sir! Yes, sir.

609
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:30,799
So you've no idea
where he came from?

610
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:32,365
No idea.

611
00:56:32,366 --> 00:56:34,465
Have you thought
about calling the cops?

612
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:37,082
What are they gonna do, Emmo?

613
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:39,027
They just gonna send him away to a lab

614
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:40,638
and do weird science
experiments on him.

615
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:42,802
Weird science!

616
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:45,708
Plastic tubes and
pots and pans!

617
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:48,274
You're getting pretty good
with that radio dial, Bee.

618
00:56:48,298 --> 00:56:50,298
Dj Bumble in the house!
Woo-Hoo!

619
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:57,432
Is that why you're always
messing with the dial?

620
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:01,232
You're trying to teach yourself
how to talk, aren't you?

621
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:08,332
- No way!
- Oh, my god, Bee! You're genius! You're an actual genius!

622
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:19,965
What's going on here?

623
00:57:19,966 --> 00:57:23,799
That's trip from sixth period.
He said he was busy this week.

624
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:26,799
I mean, you want to get out?

625
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:32,099
- This is pretty cool.
- Okay..

626
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:33,232
Bee, We will be right back.

627
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,532
Don't do anything crazy.

628
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:38,765
Hey, everybody, come, watch!
Trip's gonna jump!

629
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,399
Hey... what's going on
over there?

630
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:41,665
Dude, you're crazy!

631
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,999
- Come on! It's not that big of jump.
- Is that trip summers?

632
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:46,718
Oh, you know... you know trip?

633
00:57:46,742 --> 00:57:49,623
I mean, yeah. I-I spilled a galon
of lemonade on him once.

634
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:53,099
Let's see anyone have the balls
to jump off this thing with me.

635
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,642
Ah!

636
00:57:57,366 --> 00:57:59,732
- Brave volunteer!
- I... I... see I didn't...

637
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:01,565
I didn't do that.

638
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:03,568
You've got the touch!

639
00:58:04,793 --> 00:58:09,634
You've got the power...!

640
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:13,932
Hey! I know you.

641
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:16,247
Ah... nah!
Sorry about that.

642
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:18,426
You were on the dive team
with my little sister.

643
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:20,865
I saw you win state
couple of years ago.

644
00:58:21,424 --> 00:58:23,299
Oh... a... Yeah.

645
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,419
Ladies and gentlemen! This has
just got whole lot more interesting.

646
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:29,667
We have a championship
high diver on our hands.

647
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:34,634
Yeah, I, actually...
I don't... I don't...

648
00:58:34,634 --> 00:58:36,297
I don't do that anymore.

649
00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:38,521
Oh, don't worry,
I won't make you go first.

650
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:45,899
Hold on, buddy!

651
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,932
Dive girl! Isn't that enough?

652
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:10,332
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

653
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,732
Come on!

654
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:17,365
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

655
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,965
- Where are you going?
- Where're you going, dear?

656
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,912
- Are you okay?
- Let's just go.

657
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:35,423
- Loser!
- I thought you said you were on the diving team!

658
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:42,432
Where are you going, sweety?

659
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:51,860
What happened out there?

660
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:54,199
That was your
big moment to let go.

661
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,932
What's your damage, tina?

662
00:59:55,933 --> 00:59:58,832
- Is that the churros guy?
- Where's your hairnet, dude?

663
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:01,730
It's in the garbage, I saw you
threw some wear, which you used..

664
01:00:01,754 --> 01:00:04,454
...for sanitary purposes
obviously, but...

665
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:08,132
This car is an embarresment.

666
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:12,132
You should have your dad
buy you a better one.

667
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,965
Oui!

668
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,699
Sorry.

669
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:39,199
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

670
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,999
They are idiots.

671
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:44,632
I think I know something
that'd make you feel better.

672
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,804
- What?
- Revenge!

673
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:52,665
- I don't want revenge.
- I do.

674
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:55,265
What about you, Bee?
Want some revenge?

675
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,064
Revenge!

676
01:01:00,914 --> 01:01:02,314
Oh, man!

677
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,899
Come on.
I've got an idea.

678
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,599
This is tina's house.

679
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,499
And this is toilet paper.

680
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,332
You use it for when you...
Here, just take this.

681
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,032
No! No, no, no!

682
01:01:23,384 --> 01:01:26,465
You gotta... throw it.

683
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,232
Like this.

684
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:33,899
Not bad.

685
01:01:46,188 --> 01:01:47,531
- Hm.
- Not bad.

686
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:51,335
Yeah, okay, Bee, you will be
our eggnap, right? Yeah.

687
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:53,999
I love to have some.

688
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:56,099
- You see these right here?
- M-hm.

689
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:01,599
You grab one
of these like so.

690
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,275
And that right there..
That's your target.

691
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:06,999
- That's right.
- Alright? Just do like this.

692
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:12,332
- You think we could just...
- We just maybe teach him at the end.

693
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,565
Oh!

694
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,599
- Bee, what...
- What...

695
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:38,332
Oh, my gosh!

696
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,699
- Hide! Hide! Hide!
- Okay, hide!

697
01:02:47,202 --> 01:02:48,868
- Just stay low!
- Okay, okay. Okay.

698
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:51,145
Hide, Bee!

699
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:04,932
Go! Go! Go!

700
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,965
Mom!

701
01:03:34,866 --> 01:03:37,999
That was..insane.

702
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,865
My heart right
now it's going crazy!

703
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:44,899
- Oh my God!
- Stop the car, please.

704
01:03:44,966 --> 01:03:48,499
No no no! Bee, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

705
01:03:48,568 --> 01:03:52,743
I can't drive... 55!

706
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:00,199
Bumblebee!
Stop!

707
01:04:17,872 --> 01:04:19,196
Oh, my god!

708
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:32,065
Oh, my god!
We're going to jail!

709
01:04:38,566 --> 01:04:43,232
We got an yellow VW car driving
it's damnself through the peaco tunnel.

710
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,132
Good night.

711
01:05:31,266 --> 01:05:33,132
Go-Good night!

712
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:44,532
Good night, Bee!

713
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,465
Come on now, buddy
I gotta go to work, okay?

714
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,991
Bee, listen to me.

715
01:06:02,116 --> 01:06:04,269
You need to
stay in this garage, okay?

716
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,573
After what happened last night, I'm pretty
sure the cops will be looking for you.

717
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:11,132
And you don't exactly...

718
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,599
I'll be back. Allright?

719
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,299
Here.

720
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:21,899
You're taking my pop-tart.

721
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:37,265
I need you to go to the frozen banana
stand and steal some sticks.

722
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,599
We're out of sticks.

723
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,065
Can't we just sell the hot-dogs
without the sticks?

724
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:43,799
No.

725
01:09:22,866 --> 01:09:24,932
- What's happened here?
- We got a hit I think.

726
01:09:24,933 --> 01:09:26,116
- Where is that location?

727
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,322
Near san fransisco.

728
01:09:27,346 --> 01:09:29,346
A coastal town named
brightonfalls.

729
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:50,732
You have a personal call.

730
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,099
- Hello?
- Charlie.Charlie. Hey, it's memo.

731
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,199
You gotta come home...
right ...now.

732
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,965
It's bad.
It's really, really bad.

733
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,232
Where is bumblebee?

734
01:10:21,633 --> 01:10:23,065
Bumblebee?

735
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,320
What've you done?
What were you thinking?

736
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,832
What...

737
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:30,832
I told you to hide
in the garage!

738
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:33,099
Great!

739
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:35,299
...

740
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,259
I'm not mad, okay.
This is all my fault.

741
01:10:40,883 --> 01:10:42,883
I never should have left you.

742
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,382
Okay, maybe don't
transform all the way.

743
01:10:49,406 --> 01:10:51,406
We... We still gonna get
you through the door.

744
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,499
Come on, buddy!

745
01:10:55,366 --> 01:10:57,165
It's okay.

746
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,832
I'am so screwed.

747
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:35,965
- And now you're crippled for the life.
- Honey, watch the hair.

748
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,632
Go! Go! Quiet!

749
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,365
Mom, Wait!

750
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:48,932
Oh my God!

751
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,265
- Mom?
- What happened?

752
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:55,246
Mom, I'm really sorry.
This is all my fault.

753
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,065
What would you do to my tv?

754
01:11:57,066 --> 01:12:00,732
But, mom, I can explain.
We will talk about this later, okay?

755
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,557
- Right now, I have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

756
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:04,240
No! You're not
going anywhere.

757
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,948
It's about my car,
it's really important.

758
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:09,839
It's about your car that you spend
all day and night shut in that garage...

759
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:13,399
...doing god know what?
- Mom, I can't. I really can't right now.

760
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,499
Oh, no! You really can!

761
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:17,665
Charlie, you really can!

762
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,932
I have had it! Your attitude!
You're always soaking around.

763
01:12:21,933 --> 01:12:25,199
You brought home that piece of
crap without even asking me!

764
01:12:25,223 --> 01:12:28,644
Every one in this family is
trying to be happy!

765
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:31,068
And all you want to do is
make things harder!

766
01:12:31,092 --> 01:12:33,044
You know, mom, just because you've
moved on

767
01:12:33,068 --> 01:12:34,431
and you're happy
with your new life...

768
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:36,232
...dosen't mean I have!

769
01:12:36,266 --> 01:12:40,154
You found a replacement for my dad
and I haven't, okay, I never will.

770
01:12:40,178 --> 01:12:42,638
So I'm sorry if that
make things harder.

771
01:12:42,638 --> 01:12:43,887
But in ten months from now,

772
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:45,911
you won't even have to deal with me.

773
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:49,565
Charlie!

774
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,899
Hey, you okay?

775
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,365
Yeah.

776
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:08,472
You know, I just feel like
ever since my dad died...

777
01:13:08,496 --> 01:13:11,878
...I've become this dream
on everyone, and I hate it.

778
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:14,951
You know, it's like everybody
expects me to act...

779
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:16,833
...but nothing ever
happen and it's...

780
01:13:16,857 --> 01:13:18,769
It's impossible to do that.

781
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:24,832
Ah..about your dad,
I'm... I'm really sorry.

782
01:13:24,866 --> 01:13:26,399
Thanks.

783
01:13:26,566 --> 01:13:30,565
You know there is...
there is this line that I like.

784
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:35,332
"The darkest nights
produce the brightest stars."

785
01:13:39,266 --> 01:13:41,299
That's nice.

786
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,899
Mom got it from
weight losers.

787
01:13:45,866 --> 01:13:47,499
Huh.

788
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,465
Get out and move
away from the vehicle.

789
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,932
Stay cool, Bee.

790
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,465
What's going on?

791
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,596
Hey!

792
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,620
- Come on!
- Stop it!

793
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,632
Let go of me!

794
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:23,699
- Weapons, now! Take it down!
- Run!

795
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:26,099
No, don't run!
Do not run!

796
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,699
And she ran.

797
01:14:53,866 --> 01:14:56,365
Please tell me they are on our side.

798
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:12,665
No more running!
No more Hiding!

799
01:15:16,533 --> 01:15:20,588
B-127, you are a traitor
and a coward!

800
01:15:20,941 --> 01:15:23,375
Tell us where Optimus
Prime is hiding!

801
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,065
Bee, lookout!

802
01:15:30,233 --> 01:15:32,365
Why isn't he fighting back?

803
01:15:32,433 --> 01:15:33,965
Why aren't you fight?

804
01:15:33,966 --> 01:15:36,632
Leave him alone! Please!

805
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,299
Again!

806
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,399
Hit it again!

807
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:49,899
Stop! Stop it!

808
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,829
Your daughter stole government
property, Mrs.watson.

809
01:16:21,853 --> 01:16:24,476
She's been having
troubles, but...

810
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,968
...we had no idea
it was this serious.

811
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,822
I... Charlie..honey..

812
01:16:29,822 --> 01:16:32,730
Look, I didn't steal anything
and he dosen't belong to them.

813
01:16:32,736 --> 01:16:36,720
- He?
- Ma'am..I can assure you that <i>it</i> isn't <i>it</i>.

814
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,246
And <i>it</i> is a highly dangeorus
war machine.

815
01:16:39,246 --> 01:16:40,647
No! <i>He</i> isn't, okay, Mom?

816
01:16:40,671 --> 01:16:42,371
<i>He</i>'s not some war machine!

817
01:16:42,395 --> 01:16:47,765
I... I don't know what he is,
but he's my friend.

818
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,164
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic expirience today.

819
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:52,177
Maybe misunderstand
everything she's seen.

820
01:16:52,177 --> 01:16:53,542
Just disoriented.

821
01:16:53,566 --> 01:16:56,516
No! I'm fine, Mom.
I'm completly fine.

822
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:59,269
Okay? You have to believe me!
Please! I didn't steal anything.

823
01:16:59,269 --> 01:17:01,532
Stop!
Just go to your room!

824
01:17:09,033 --> 01:17:13,378
You know, when I was going
through puberty, I stole things too.

825
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,732
- I stole box of Mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

826
01:18:00,295 --> 01:18:01,693
Boom!

827
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:04,465
Gotcha!

828
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:06,284
Oh, Mom's gonna love this.

829
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:07,888
Alright, Otis, look, you
just need to go home.

830
01:18:07,889 --> 01:18:10,232
- Mom!
- No, Otis!

831
01:18:10,266 --> 01:18:12,534
Stop it! Why would you do that?

832
01:18:12,558 --> 01:18:14,558
Let go of me!
You're touching my...

833
01:18:15,466 --> 01:18:18,599
I'll tell you a secret,
if you shut up.

834
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:23,387
Okay, so, this is my room.

835
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,727
You should make yourself home.
These are actually, like, my sister's stuff.

836
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:29,841
She likes playing pranks, like,
putting her stuff over here.

837
01:18:29,866 --> 01:18:32,122
- Can I sit down?
- Ye-Yeah! Yeah!

838
01:18:32,122 --> 01:18:36,066
<i>Residants of Brighton Falls have been
witnessed to an unusual sight this evening.</i>

839
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:38,387
<i>Armed forces pouring in to town..</i>

840
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:42,258
<i>...as a part of what we were told,
is a routine military exersice,</i>

841
01:18:42,325 --> 01:18:45,241
<i>setting up camp at our
own mackinon air base.</i>

842
01:18:45,266 --> 01:18:47,816
If bumblebee still alive, that's
where they keeping him.

843
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,378
We have to go, We have to
try and safe him.

844
01:18:50,402 --> 01:18:52,604
Count me in.
I'll take point.

845
01:18:53,107 --> 01:18:54,407
No, you won't.

846
01:18:54,466 --> 01:18:56,265
- Come on!
- No, Otis.

847
01:18:56,266 --> 01:18:58,740
- But I can help. Master...
- Look, I need someone here.

848
01:18:59,464 --> 01:19:01,294
I need someone reliable
to make sure that

849
01:19:01,318 --> 01:19:03,176
mom and Ron don't
know that I'm gone.

850
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,873
I am someone reliable.

851
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:08,099
Hell, yeah! You're.

852
01:19:12,316 --> 01:19:13,955
Good luck.

853
01:19:14,192 --> 01:19:16,701
You too.
Get over here.

854
01:19:23,409 --> 01:19:25,005
Let's do this.

855
01:19:27,461 --> 01:19:30,705
Tell us where optimus prime
and the rebels are hiding..

856
01:19:30,842 --> 01:19:33,328
...and we can end this war.

857
01:19:35,675 --> 01:19:37,534
- Talk!
- Who is this...

858
01:19:37,558 --> 01:19:39,035
...Optimus prime?

859
01:19:39,259 --> 01:19:41,748
It's not your concern, Human Powell.

860
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:44,099
Last chance.

861
01:19:50,233 --> 01:19:52,765
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

862
01:19:52,766 --> 01:19:54,670
It's a terrible idea,
but I gotta try it.

863
01:19:54,994 --> 01:19:57,481
Wait, No! That stuff...

864
01:19:57,939 --> 01:20:00,808
- How did you know the power was off?
- I didn't. Let's go.

865
01:20:06,621 --> 01:20:10,865
- Can I?
- His memory cells are fried.

866
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:13,532
Finish him.

867
01:20:18,066 --> 01:20:20,410
<i>We will fight on...</i>

868
01:20:20,434 --> 01:20:23,327
<i>...regroup, rebuild
and retake our home.</i>

869
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,060
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

870
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,090
<i>You will travel to earth.</i>

871
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,764
<i>Once we've gathered the others,
we will join you.</i>

872
01:20:30,946 --> 01:20:33,149
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

873
01:20:33,173 --> 01:20:37,991
<i>If the decepticons find it, then
our people are truly finished.</i>

874
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,399
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

875
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,999
<i>I am coming.</i>

876
01:20:44,766 --> 01:20:47,099
Prime is coming here?

877
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,217
They're all coming here.

878
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:53,660
This is our chance to wipe out
the autobot ressistance for good.

879
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:56,984
We'll burn down the whole
planet to cinders.

880
01:20:57,608 --> 01:20:59,808
We must get word to
Cybertron immediatly.

881
01:20:59,832 --> 01:21:02,732
- This is Burns.
- Tell them to bring an army.

882
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,565
- Burns, we've made a terrible mistake.
- Powell?

883
01:21:06,966 --> 01:21:09,555
And thanks to our human allies...

884
01:21:10,005 --> 01:21:12,383
...I know just how to
get the message home.

885
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,916
They're using our satellites,
they're call in an army.

886
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,014
They're gonna kill us all.

887
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,687
Thank you for your
hospitality, friend Powell.

888
01:21:23,632 --> 01:21:25,782
He's all yours.

889
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,489
- No!
- Powell?

890
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:29,999
- You have to stop them.
- Powell! Powell!

891
01:21:33,866 --> 01:21:37,532
- Where's the Krazy glue?
- What? Did you Cut the wire to the TV?

892
01:21:37,842 --> 01:21:40,112
Ron!
Oh!

893
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:43,599
Charlie!
Charlie!

894
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,632
Nice! The reel-to-reel
still works.

895
01:21:47,466 --> 01:21:49,199
Where is your sister?

896
01:21:50,266 --> 01:21:53,569
Charlie has fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

897
01:21:53,613 --> 01:21:56,581
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

898
01:21:57,066 --> 01:21:58,565
What?

899
01:22:02,733 --> 01:22:06,899
Charlie has fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

900
01:22:07,028 --> 01:22:08,042
She wishes not to...

901
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:11,499
Otis, are you on drugs? Hm?

902
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,084
No no! Mom, mom.
Please! Stop! Stop!

903
01:22:14,108 --> 01:22:16,435
- Charlie?
- Mom, there is no reason to go...

904
01:22:16,459 --> 01:22:18,459
- Mom! Mom, stop!
- Otis!

905
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,732
Where is she?

906
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:31,799
- She...
- Otis!

907
01:22:33,766 --> 01:22:37,047
I've found a tower to transmit
our message. It's close.

908
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,914
B-127, I almost forgot.

909
01:22:42,914 --> 01:22:45,096
I didn't.

910
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,699
No, don't shoot!

911
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,832
Bee!

912
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,175
Bee?

913
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,865
Talk to me, Bee!
Talk to me.

914
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:15,899
Oh...

915
01:23:18,068 --> 01:23:20,293
I can fix this.

916
01:23:20,317 --> 01:23:22,890
I can fix this.

917
01:23:25,565 --> 01:23:27,669
- Charlie...
- You have gotta wake up, Bee!

918
01:23:28,493 --> 01:23:31,406
You gotta wake up!
Please!

919
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:35,486
Charlie, we gotta go.

920
01:23:35,683 --> 01:23:37,268
Charlie...

921
01:23:39,332 --> 01:23:40,885
- The gun!
- What?

922
01:23:40,885 --> 01:23:42,656
The electric gun. Get it.

923
01:23:44,421 --> 01:23:46,418
I can fix you.

924
01:23:48,154 --> 01:23:51,028
Oh, come on, Bee.
Come back to me.

925
01:23:57,881 --> 01:23:59,712
Come on, give me
the other one!

926
01:24:05,805 --> 01:24:08,192
Wake up!

927
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:12,982
Please!
Please, Bee!

928
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,791
I'm sorry.

929
01:24:53,263 --> 01:24:55,199
Oh my God!

930
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:57,482
Come on, Bee, we're gonna
get you out of here.

a million guys out there.

933
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,871
We gotta move now!

934
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:15,734
Come on, Bee!

935
01:25:15,758 --> 01:25:17,565
You gotta get up.
Can you get up?

936
01:25:17,966 --> 01:25:20,631
- There is a door in my way!
- Move! Move! Move!

937
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,308
They've got bombs!
We gotta go!

938
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,999
Bee, come on!

939

Memo?
Memo, wake up.

946
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:04,199
Easy.

947
01:26:06,733 --> 01:26:08,599
Easy.

948
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,215
Hold your fire.
Get the kids out of here.

949
01:26:14,933 --> 01:26:17,832
Memo, wake up! Memo?

01:26:18,066 --> 01:26:20,616

Run!
Let go of me!

954
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,820
We need to get away
from that thing!
