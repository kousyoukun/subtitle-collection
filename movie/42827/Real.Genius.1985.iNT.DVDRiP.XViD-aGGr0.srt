1
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,271
<i>Crossbow, this is Watchdog.
Confirm transmissions.</i>

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,038
<i>Roger, Watchdog. Crossbow is on
Discriminator, and all systems are go.</i>

3
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,438
<i>Roger, we mark you go
for maneuvering sequence.</i>

4
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,354
Watchdog, this is Crossbow.
Confirm we are go for arm.

5
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>Affirmative, Crossbow.</i>

6
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,274
<i>Select electrics to max, vents
to open, and systems to onboard.</i>

7
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,875
<i>- Roger. Crossbow is armed.
- Roger.</i>

8
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,719
<i>We have confirmation.
Rabbit in the hole.</i>

9
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,032
Moving Target Indicator, engaged.

10
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,119
<i>- Pathfinder on. I'm going on the scope.
- Roger.</i>

11
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,748
<i>Scanner on.</i>

12
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,834
Target locked.
Tracking locked.

13
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,197
<i>- Roger.
- Easy does it. That's it.</i>

14
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,351
Hold it right there.

15
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,590
<i>The Crossbow Project.</i>

16
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,952
<i>- There's no defence like a good offense.
- Mission accomplished.</i>

17
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,871
<i>- Outstanding, Crossbow.
- Just like shooting ducks in a barrel.</i>

18
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,635
<i>Our scientists are
turning an engineering dream...</i>

19
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,476
<i>...into an effective reality.
- All we have to do is build it.</i>

20
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,315
- Nice weapon, isn't it?
- What did you think, Roy?

21
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,438
I think there weren't
enough girls in it.

22
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,508
I have a tape on alternate uses,
mini-shuttle plans...

23
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,553
...and B-1 modifications
for aerial launch.

24
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,593
Does any responsible agency
know about this?

25
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,997
It's a need-to-know basis.
The CIA's responsible.

26
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,233
They do need to know.
You're gonna cause an escalation.

27
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,678
Our studies indicate
this weapon is useless in warfare.

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,994
It's not for war. It's a peacetime
weapon. That's why it's secret.

29
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,119
- So it's both immoral and unethical?
- Yes.

30
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,396
When do we get it?

31
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,872
There is a tiny technical
problem with the energy source...

32
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,318
I don't want problems.
We have plans for it this summer.

33
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,432
I need a success. I don't need
any delays jeopardizing that.

34
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,672
- Am I making myself clear?
- Clear as vodka.

35
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,673
Tell Dr. Hathaway to get on the stick.

36
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,755
- I'm gonna have to push harder.
- As long as we have a weapon by June.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,638
- Right?
- I wouldn't know.

38
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,838
I haven't had
a working weapon since Korea.

39
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,309
I'm sorry, this is too much.

40
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,951
- I'm gonna ask for a reassignment.
- I'm sorry to hear that, George.

41
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,348
I urge you to stop.

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,115
Thanks for your input.
Sorry you won't be on the team.

43
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,276
Maybe next time.

44
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,035
Too bad. Used to be a good man.

45
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,437
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to liberate George.

46
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,279
Liberate? You mean, liquidate?

47
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,640
Let's see that film on blinding
techniques. Then we'll have lunch.

48
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,838
- Could you sign this?
- Are you Doctor Hathaway?

49
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,434
- I just loved your television show.
- Thank you. That's very kind of you.

50
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,398
- What is Mr. Einstein really like?
- Dead.

51
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,834
Dad, laser means light amplification
by stimulated emissions of radiation.

52
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,275
So this is coherent light.

53
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,796
- Oh, so it talks, right?
- No.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,878
- Dr. Hathaway, what a surprise!
- How are you?

55
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,716
Is something wrong with the test
scores? If there is, it's because...

56
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,832
I thought I'd bring
you the news myself.

57
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,477
I got word from admissions.
Mitch is in at Pacific Tech.

58
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,278
- Wonderful!
- Way to go!

59
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,078
Don't shake his head!

60
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,878
- How you doing?
- Fine.

61
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,270
- Nice display here.
- Thanks.

62
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,274
It's a flash lamp
ultraviolet laser at 342 nanometres.

63
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,036
As you know, there is interest
in the iodine laser for fusion.

64
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,394
This is molecular iodine. This laser
doesn't suffer from recombination.

65
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,439
You must be proud.

66
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,874
- Proud?
- Sure.

67
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,755
He's the first student we've
accepted for winter term.

68
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,913
- I bet he's the youngest too.
- The youngest was 12.

69
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,236
He cracked under the pressure...

70
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,438
He's 15. There won't be any problem.

71
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,395
Listen, about the scholarship.
You're gonna give him a bonus, right?

72
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,434
No. But by allowing Mitch to progress
at a quicker rate...

73
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,117
...we give him the chance to fill
a greater portion of his potential.

74
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,440
We want the best for Mitchie. I saw
your show on radioactive isotopes.

75
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,069
- And I've got a question.
- Yes?

76
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,709
- Is that your real hair?
- Yeah?

77
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,033
- Tell me, is Mitch adopted?
- Why, no!

78
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,032
- It's amazing.
- Isn't it?

79
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,390
I need something to eat. Come on.

80
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,632
- Bye, Dr. Hathaway.
- Goodbye.

81
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,515
See you later, honey.

82
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,838
They're okay. Sometimes they
don't know what I'm talking about.

83
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,471
I'm sure about that. Tell me,
are you gonna miss your friends?

84
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,110
- No, I think I intimidate other kids.
- Good boy.

85
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,078
Understand, compared to you, most
people have the IQ of a carrot.

86
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,471
We're different from most people.
Better. I'm...

87
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,679
- There you are, doctor!
- Hi. Yes, one second.

88
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,630
I've put you on my research team
with the best minds. This is only...

89
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,635
...the second time for a freshman.
- The first was Chris Knight, right?

90
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,752
- You've heard of him?
- He's a physics legend.

91
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,193
You'll be working with him. He's
a senior now, as brilliant as ever.

92
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,431
Wow!

93
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,276
- This job will be waiting, Chris.
- Great.

94
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,035
- We have a physical plant here.
- You have a Jacuzzi?

95
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,673
- Absolutely.
- Good.

96
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,436
And the labs and offices are
over this way. Follow me, please.

97
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,436
Guys!

98
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,679
- Meet Chris Knight. This is Sherry.
- Pleased to meet you.

99
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,480
- This is Mike Dodd.
- Dr. Dodd?

100
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,236
- He designed our new Telcom satellite.
- It's an honour to meet you.

101
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,072
Telcom.

102
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,437
The satellite raining debris
all over Europe?

103
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,358
Why is that on your head?

104
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,433
If I wear it anywhere else,
it chafes.

105
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,269
I'm sorry. I didn't want you
to think I was stuffy.

106
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,433
You know, no fun.
All brain, no penis.

107
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,677
- Pardon me?
- I'm sorry.

108
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,480
It's an infantile response
to authority.

109
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,793
- You are Chris Knight?
- I hope so. I'm wearing his underwear.

110
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,878
It's a joke! I get it!
Funny!

111
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,270
I can't help it.
You're such fun.

112
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,478
We try to be.
Isn't that right, Mike?

113
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,438
No.

114
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,476
Sherry's gonna show you around. Ask
questions about benefits, dress codes.

115
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,473
- I'll see you in my office later.
- Great.

116
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,635
Take care of him. He's one of the ten
finest minds in the country!

117
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,434
Someday I hope to be two of them.

118
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,831
- You are beautiful.
- Thanks.

119
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,473
Did I come off stuffy?

120
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,678
You don't act like
one of the top ten minds.

121
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,275
- How many have you met?
- Seven.

122
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,715
- Really?
- You'll be eight.

123
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,678
Professor Hostetler was number six.

124
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,992
Old Professor Hostetler?
Isn't he dead?

125
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,590
He is now.

126
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,473
Hello. I'm looking
for the Freshman Tea?

127
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,110
Oh, good. I'm so glad
we have one then.

128
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,837
- I don't think so.
- Gene.

129
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,874
- This is Mitch Taylor.
- Hathaway's bright star.

130
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,953
- Yes, sir.
- You're already on his project.

131
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,476
- We expect great things from you.
- I hope so.

132
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,156
- A bit of advice.
- Oh, thank you.

133
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,670
Always...

134
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,230
Never forget to check
your references.

135
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,871
Okay. Thank you.

136
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,475
I better be going. Sorry.

137
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,078
The young people enjoy it
when I "get down" verbally.

138
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,835
Where's the funeral?

139
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,039
How you doing, sport?

140
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,239
Hey, Bobby, wait up, man!

141
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,829
See if he's in his room.
He might be in there.

142
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,238
Hello?

143
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,199
- What kind of place is this?
- Hi.

144
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,228
Would you be prepared
if gravity reversed itself?

145
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,835
I can't figure out how
to keep change in my pocket.

146
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,753
I've got it! Nudity!

147
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,478
I was here earlier...

148
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,676
- You didn't straighten up?
- No.

149
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,869
Good. All my filth is in alphabetical
order. This was under "H" for toy.

150
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,235
What is that?

151
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,476
It's a penis stretcher.

152
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,948
- Wanna try it?
- No!

153
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,594
I'm kidding. It's another diversion
in an attempt to avoid responsibility.

154
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,229
I left my bags. Now they're empty.

155
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,838
You see, Mitch, I used to be you.

156
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,314
I've been missing me, so I asked
if I could room with me again.

157
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,393
I put your stuff in the bottom drawer.

158
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,996
I threw out the sports jacket.
Duck!

159
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,436
Nice reflexes. I'm Chris Knight.

160
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,676
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes. Duck again!

161
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,635
Oh, my God! It's heading
for the gas tanks. Duck!

162
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,549
Was that a launch problem
or a design problem?

163
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,510
- We're falling behind.
- We're not making sandwiches.

164
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,031
Get down!

165
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,238
Are you crazy?
You could have killed us!

166
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,835
I cannot be seen with you.

167
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,430
But since I'm driving,
shouldn't you be hiding?

168
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,710
He saw me.

169
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,513
The climate has changed. We need a
working model in four months, not 18.

170
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,832
You can't dictate innovation, Don.

171
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,752
I'll put it another way.

172
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,236
- You know the money for development?
- Yes.

173
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,634
When a project gets cut off, the
finance boys always run an audit.

174
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,831
I see.

175
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,437
Having a little work done on
the old place, Jer? Fraud is a felony.

176
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,639
What are you looking at?
You're labourers!

177
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,071
That's what you get
for not having an education.

178
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,836
Get out of here!
Go on! Get out!

179
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,469
- Got it!
- Yeah!

180
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,434
Are you two...?

181
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,715
- Hey!
- Yes?

182
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,309
- Put down the sandwiches and go.
- Me?

183
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,909
- No, Yoda. Yeah, you!
- Just a bit.

184
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,872
- I don't have any...
- Brains?

185
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,475
- No. Sandwiches.
- What good are you?

186
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,110
- What will we eat?
- Are you from the restaurant?

187
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,230
No! I'm Mitch Taylor. I'm a student.
Dr. Hathaway told me to come up here.

188
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,957
So you're the new stud, are you?

189
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,473
- How do you mean?
- Stud. Hotshot. Brain.

190
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,429
- You're 12, right?
- I'm 15. Are you expecting him...?

191
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,915
Yeah. Can I get you something?

192
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,676
- A balloon?
- I'm supposed to check over your work.

193
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,639
- Check it over?
- Well, yes.

194
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,876
- For what?
- Mistakes, I guess.

195
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,399
- He said you guys were stuck.
- No! Let's get something clear here.

196
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,076
Okay, when Jerry's not here,
you do what I say.

197
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,075
It goes from God to Jerry to me.
Get it?

198
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,355
Hello, Jerry.

199
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,559
- You don't get to use my first name.
- Did I?

200
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,839
How you doing, Mitch?
I'm sure you'll all be friends.

201
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,832
- We're on our way.
- Good.

202
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,277
I want you to take
your cues from Mitch.

203
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,069
His ideas are
the most original I've seen.

204
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,995
- So Mitch is in charge of the group.
- Really, Jerry?

205
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,708
- You're doing it again.
- Oh, am I?

206
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,034
- Where is Knight?
- He didn't bother to come in today.

207
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,674
- Yes?
- He said he didn't feel like it.

208
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,436
I said, "You better or you'll be
in trouble." He said, "Jam it!"

209
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,832
- Great. You're not stuttering.
- I give myself shock treatments.

210
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,268
Up the voltage.

211
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,876
- I'm sorry he's not here...
- That clown? Look!

212
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,714
Kent decided to start without him.

213
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,595
The yield's insignificant.
We think the sample's damaged.

214
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,276
- What?
- Obviously the result of negligence.

215
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,877
It'll take a week to prepare a new
sample. I was afraid of this.

216
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,554
- Are you sure?
- We're sure. Positive.

217
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,678
- Excuse me.
- There is no excuse for it.

218
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,072
- Yeah, Mitch, what is it?
- The pump laser is down.

219
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,038
Look.

220
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,674
There.

221
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,117
Well, it seems to be all better now.

222
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,079
Don't touch other people's things!

223
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,630
- Kent, I need you.
- Anything, Jerry.

224
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,475
What? Do you want me to teach
your class for you?

225
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,633
No, I need you to get copies
of all the data so far.

226
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,037
So Mitch can check
everything tomorrow.

227
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,676
- My pleasure.
- After that, stop by my cleaners.

228
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,831
Don't give it a thought.

229
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,271
- Mitch, shall we? On the moment.
- Sure.

230
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,389
Well, I guess it goes from God
to Jerry to you...

231
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,835
...to the cleaners.

232
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,435
Right, Kent?

233
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,439
Library. Library... 205.

234
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,517
Welcome to Pacific Tech's
"Smart People on Ice."

235
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,671
Let's go skating.

236
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,354
Ick, the ice turned out great!

237
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,637
Yeah, it worked, didn't it?

238
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,632
- How did you do it?
- Sure.

239
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,637
I tell you, you tell somebody else,
next we're in another ice age.

240
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,076
- Everybody must be skating.
- You're a slack!

241
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,436
- Moles and trolls.
- What?

242
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,911
Moles and trolls. Work.
We never see daylight.

243
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,119
We plan for weeks and all
they do is study. I'm disgusted.

244
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,154
I'm sorry, but it's not like me.
I'm depressed.

245
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,678
We had one entry for the Madame Curie
look-alike contest...

246
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,675
...and he was disqualified later.
Why do I bother?

247
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,992
Let's go! What are you,
a bunch of weirdos?

248
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,438
- Want a cherry? I grow them myself.
- What?

249
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,839
Okay, push once.

250
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,389
Are you okay?

251
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,075
No, not emotionally.
I'm disappointed. Not terribly.

252
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,714
It should have gone further, faster.

253
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,236
The problem is obviously
the drag coefficient.

254
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,870
I'll have to redesign the blades.
I can do that.

255
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,192
But I've got to cut them,
and that takes time.

256
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,472
- How long will this last?
- Maybe a half an hour.

257
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,631
That's great. I can do that.

258
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,030
- Okay. What's your name?
- Mitch.

259
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,669
Thanks for your help.
See you later.

260
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,478
You're welcome!

261
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,199
- Who was that?
- That...

262
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,439
I'm Jordan. I heard there was
someone new. Are you it?

263
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,749
Yes.

264
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,592
- Do you have a bed?
- Yeah.

265
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,032
I'd make you one, but you have one.
Okay, see you later. Bye.

266
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,037
Bye.

267
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,518
- What's all this?
- This? This is ice.

268
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,439
This is what happens
when water gets cold.

269
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,839
This is Kent. This is what happens
when people get sexually frustrated.

270
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,672
This should keep you busy.

271
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,515
This with your classes should
turn your brain to mush.

272
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,833
That's unfair. And we were gonna
make you carnival king.

273
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,116
Yeah?

274
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,636
Ha, ha. You're in on this too.
Did you make it?

275
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,115
- I'm not saying.
- Who'll clean it?

276
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,433
You don't have to.
It's gonna go directly to gas.

277
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,039
Really? What is it?

278
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,676
All I can tell you is
it's rare and unstable.

279
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,638
Just like you.

280
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,717
- You're degenerates.
- We are?

281
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,872
- I found you naked with Jell-O!
- You did not!

282
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,229
This is true.

283
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,472
I was hot, and I was hungry. Okay?

284
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,110
I got news for you, Knight.

285
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,079
- You're not first anymore.
- First what?

286
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,233
- Mitch beat your scores by 20 points.
- Yeah, you did?

287
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,069
- You think you're hot stuff, huh?
- No.

288
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,470
Maybe you are smarter than me.

289
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,234
But can you do this?

290
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,633
- Ick, what's happening with the ice?
- Open a window!

291
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,958
Ick, I'm melting!

292
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,878
- It worked!
- Neat!

293
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,035
- Now if we can keep it from exploding.
- Exploding? Oh, God.

294
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,868
Hey, Ick. You're just joking
about exploding, right?

295
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,590
Ick? It's a joke, right?

296
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,030
Good morning. I saw you come in.
We met last night? I'm Jordan.

297
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,714
- I made you a sweater.
- Last night?

298
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,872
It's something I do.
Hope the size is right.

299
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,395
I used my brother
as a comparison.

300
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,076
I went ahead and made you one,
because I was up.

301
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,675
- Are you peeing?
- Yeah.

302
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,117
I never sleep.
I drove my roommate nuts.

303
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,314
She's okay, but she had to transfer.
I don't know if that's my fault.

304
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,839
If you ever need to talk, let me know,
because I never sleep, okay?

305
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,752
- I will.
- Are you done?

306
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,829
- I can't start.
- Because I'm here?

307
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,877
I think so.

308
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,033
- Weird. Well, I have to go.
- Me too.

309
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,236
Bye.

310
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,434
Good morning!

311
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,276
- Chris?
- Morning.

312
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,756
You know, something strange
happened this morning.

313
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,476
Was it a dream where you're standing
in a robe on a pyramid...

314
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,872
...with 1000 naked women screaming
and throwing pickles at you?

315
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,269
No.

316
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,830
Why am I the only person
that has that dream?

317
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,640
Is that liquid nitrogen?

318
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,151
- Coffee?
- No.

319
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,151
- What happened?
- There's a guy in our closet.

320
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,196
You've seen him too?

321
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,993
Who is he?

322
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,549
Hollyfeld.

323
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,314
- Why does he go in?
- Why do you go in?

324
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,478
To get my clothes.
But that's not why he does.

325
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,315
Of course not.
Your clothes would never fit him.

326
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,631
Yeah.

327
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,071
Think before you ask.

328
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,030
Twenty points higher and thinks
a guy like that can wear his clothes.

329
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,512
<i>plus y, equals zero.</i>

330
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,631
This is it!

331
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,909
Come on, get out of here! Get!

332
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,834
- You wanted to see me?
- Mr. Knight.

333
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,838
Right on time.
Unusual these days.

334
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,237
- You still run?
- Only when chased.

335
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,875
- What smells?
- Must be the dog.

336
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,712
- That's popcorn.
- I know.

337
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,072
Get it away from me. I hate popcorn.
Put it over there.

338
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,437
Now I know what to get you
for your birthday.

339
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,430
I guess we're moving up
in the world, eh?

340
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,433
- Very elegant.
- Try not to touch anything.

341
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,235
- Is this okay, sir?
- It's oak, it's not plywood.

342
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,830
- Quite a change from the old place.
- Shoes.

343
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,474
I want to see
more of you in the lab.

344
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,233
Fine. I'll gain weight.

345
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,274
- You're very funny, Chris.
- Thanks, Jerry, we try.

346
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,431
You can sit.

347
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,633
When I brought you here,
I thought you'd be an Einstein.

348
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,077
- You were on your way. Then?
- I got a haircut.

349
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,914
- You're disappointing me.
- And you me.

350
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,039
- Look, it's about our deal.
- I know, Jerry.

351
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,192
I've advanced your project
more than anyone.

352
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,352
Yesterday. What have you done
for me today?

353
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,034
Well, uh...

354
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,430
I want five megawatts by mid-May.

355
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,114
I think you might be getting obsessive
about all this. I took in Mitch, okay?

356
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,069
He's coming along fine.
He's working his guts out.

357
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,108
- So, what do you want?
- I want five megawatts by mid-May.

358
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,030
Look, I don't care
if you're arrogant or disrespectful.

359
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,471
But you're distracting Mitch.
That I won't have.

360
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,633
The rules have changed.
I want it by mid-May.

361
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,477
Jerry, I think you're forgetting
one little detail. I'm out of here.

362
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,029
I'm gone, I'm history.
I'm Casper.

363
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,592
- I'm graduating.
- To graduate, you need my course.

364
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,110
I have a say about
what you do and where you go.

365
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,069
So you and Mitch will spend
every moment in the lab.

366
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,438
You will solve my power problem
by my deadline.

367
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,837
If you think that threatening me
will make me your slave, you're right.

368
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,231
But I'm only saying this
because I care.

369
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,679
There are decaffeinated brands
that are as tasty as the real thing.

370
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,434
I'm not kidding, Chris.

371
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,234
Neither am I, Jerry.

372
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,709
Hi, Mitch.

373
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,193
Do me a favour.

374
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,234
Taste this.
Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.

375
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,074
What, too sweet?

376
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,515
- What is it?
- I don't know, it was in the lab.

377
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,358
Relax, it's just yogurt.

378
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,792
- Mitch, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

379
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,869
This combination of cyanide is dumb.
This is the wrong direction.

380
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,433
Only you know how to use this garbage.
And I'm getting brain-fried.

381
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,077
I'll make it up to you.
Let's just pause, put that down.

382
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,796
Let's just take a step back.

383
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,195
No, take a step forward.

384
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,036
Now, take a step back.
And a step forward. Then step back.

385
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,349
- Will you stop? I'm serious.
- Okay, I'm serious too.

386
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,836
Let's charge it up.
Give me everything you got.

387
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,359
- I gotta connect the capacitors.
- Okay, this is work time.

388
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,996
- How you doing?
- Fine. Don't rush me.

389
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,392
Okay, just take your time.
Everything's fine.

390
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,674
What is taking so long?

391
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,389
I'm coming.

392
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,074
Charging.

393
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,993
Shades.

394
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,389
- What are you doing?
- Waiting.

395
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,234
It's just the fuse.
It'll be back on in a minute.

396
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,995
I shouldn't have used
the building transformer.

397
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,988
But, more importantly,
did we get a charge?

398
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,234
What'd you do?

399
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,472
- Wait!
- Come on, Sputnik.

400
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,558
You wanted help,
so here we go.

401
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,078
- Beautiful minds.
- We have work.

402
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,788
We're going to work.
Hard work.

403
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,195
This must've taken hours.

404
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,719
Let's find out.

405
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,919
I told you they'd come back on.

406
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,391
- What's this?
- It's a laser beam, bozo.

407
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,598
- What's it for?
- Not what. Where.

408
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,588
- What?
- Follow it. It's a surprise.

409
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,511
Like it?

410
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,272
Hey, what's the beam splitter for?

411
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,671
What's the matter?
Need everything spelled out for you?

412
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,390
Come on, let's tan!

413
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,279
One for Mitch.

414
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,231
Come on in,
the South Pacific calls you.

415
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,513
- Who're the girls?
- Not from around here.

416
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,908
- They're from a nearby college.
- Where?

417
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,549
The Wanda Trossler Beauty School.

418
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,435
- They're beauticians?
- Not yet.

419
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,519
- I don't know.
- Your genius might impress them.

420
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,631
I don't see how.

421
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,630
Given the type of guys you are...

422
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,637
...this may be your only chance
in your entire lives...

423
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,836
...to have sex.

424
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,110
Think about it.

425
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,748
Destiny!
I've got her now.

426
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,637
Don't you know that eating that
can give you large breasts?

427
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,394
Oh, my God.
I'm too late.

428
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,032
Don't think I don't
want my invention to work.

429
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,273
- The day's only so long.
- Ready to go.

430
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,717
Pushing me doesn't help.
Tell them that.

431
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,033
Start showing results
or they'll find somebody else.

432
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,431
- Oh, really?
- You won't have your big toys.

433
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,269
I'm the best.
Do you know who you're dealing with?

434
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,593
How dare you try this.
I have to go on.

435
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,236
This conversation is in
incredibly poor taste.

436
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,153
- Son of a bitch.
- Asshole.

437
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,629
<i>Welcome to Everything,
with Jerome Hathaway.</i>

438
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,635
<i>Funded by a grant from
Darlington E lectronic Instruments.</i>

439
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,628
<i>Hi, I'm Jerry Hathaway,
with Everything.</i>

440
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,716
Tonight, we'll look at something
that most of us take for granted.

441
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,869
The colon.
What does it look like?

442
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,908
Get out of there.

443
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,791
- Kent!
- Cut!

444
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,471
- You're in front of the teleprompter.
- Well, I didn't know.

445
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,833
- We need to talk.
- Get my laundry?

446
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,594
- Yes, but there's more.
- The gravy.

447
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,913
No, that came out.
Chris and Mitch, they're at a party.

448
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,111
With girls.

449
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,872
- I want you to show me.
- My pleasure.

450
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,875
- Hi, are you busy?
- Yes. No.

451
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,914
Wanna help test my rebreather?
Come on!

452
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,593
Sure!

453
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,669
It's a simple principle.
It's basically a filter.

454
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,198
It lets CO2 out and O2 back in,
but no bubbles.

455
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,189
- How come you're not...?
- Necking? I'm not gay!

456
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,874
No, partying.

457
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,878
Because I'm 19 and I'm brilliant
and hyperkinetic.

458
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,913
Guys are afraid.
I guess I should be upset.

459
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,519
I think you're very nice.

460
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,440
I think you're nice too.

461
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,595
Do you want to try this?

462
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,109
- It's lighter in the water.
- How about you?

463
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,154
Taylor!

464
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,358
- Why aren't you in the lab?
- I just...

465
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,199
You're here to work,
not to play doctor.

466
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,039
- I got delayed.
- Where's Knight?

467
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,158
- You both make me sick.
- Kent!

468
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,274
I took a chance recommending you.
I can see I made a mistake.

469
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,948
I hope you're proud of yourself.

470
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,956
- Dr. Hathaway?
- What?

471
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,476
Are you wearing makeup?

472
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,759
What?

473
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,195
I need one more course
to complete my humanities credits.

474
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,358
I'd like to make a collect call
to Mrs. Bill Taylor.

475
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,394
- Come on, come on.
- Mitch Taylor.

476
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,874
I got a great idea.

477
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,599
- What?
- Hold it down!

478
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,392
Mom, I...

479
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,789
I want to come home.

480
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,630
<i>- Are you there?
- Baby, you sound upset.</i>

481
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,510
I don't like it here.
I wanna come home.

482
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,153
You rented out my room?!
To who?

483
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,238
<i>Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.</i>

484
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,998
- Where were you last night?
- The lab, where you should've been.

485
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,630
Jordan said that Hathaway was mad.
What exactly did he...?

486
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,030
Let me hold that thought
and get back to you.

487
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,396
<i>- Are you there?
- Baby, you sound upset.</i>

488
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,797
<i>I don't like it here.
I wanna come home.</i>

489
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,878
<i>It's not for you to like,
it's for you to do.</i>

490
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,834
<i>- You're 15 years old.
- I wanna come home.</i>

491
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,834
<i>- You want to live with me and Daddy?
- Yeah.</i>

492
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,638
<i>- I'll go back to high school.
- We've rented out your room.</i>

493
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,638
<i>- Mom, to who?
- Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.</i>

494
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,190
<i>We can share it.
I don't wanna stay here.</i>

495
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,553
<i>- That doesn't sound like my soldier.
- Mitch, this is your dad.</i>

496
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,838
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Are you crying?</i>

497
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,429
<i>- I'm sorry.
- I hope nobody sees.</i>

498
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,036
<i>- I'm a kid.
- You've never been just a kid.</i>

499
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,678
If you wanna leave, go ahead.

500
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,875
But you're gonna miss the fun.

501
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,399
What fun?

502
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,115
Ick's releasing a new virus
in Kent's room.

503
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,791
- The other night I needed your help.
- I helped you relax.

504
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,237
Being snubbed by beauticians
is not relaxing.

505
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,795
Student beauticians.

506
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,118
I thought this place was different.
But it's the same.

507
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,113
In high school,
I got put in a mailbox.

508
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,993
Teachers hated me
because I was smarter.

509
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,795
Students hated me because
I blew the bell curve.

510
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,632
I was just like you.

511
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,793
I had white shirts and Hush Puppies
and a briefcase.

512
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,911
Girls never talked to me.

513
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,869
When I got here, for
three years I studied constantly.

514
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,037
- You?
- Yeah.

515
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,314
One night, sitting right here,
I had a vision.

516
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,830
- What?
- Hollyfeld.

517
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,319
- The guy in the closet?
- Lazlo Hollyfeld.

518
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,399
I followed him into the closet,
down into the tunnels.

519
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,388
There I saw the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

520
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,716
- What?
- Lazlo in his pajamas.

521
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,800
- So?
- So I talked to him.

522
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,439
- You did?
- Yeah.

523
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,708
He was a stud around here in the '70s.
Smarter than us put together.

524
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,995
What happened?
Did he crack?

525
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,037
He cracked, severely.

526
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,397
- Why?
- He loved his work.

527
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,395
- What's wrong with that?
- That's all he did.

528
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,831
He loved problems,
he loved the answers.

529
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,074
But he thought that the answers
were the answers for everything.

530
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,596
All science,
no philosophy.

531
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,789
One day, someone told him
the stuff he made was killing people.

532
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,118
So, what?
I'm gonna end up in a tunnel?

533
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,557
- Yeah.
- What?

534
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,672
You are,
if you keep up like this.

535
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,990
You don't need to run away.

536
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,437
When you're smart,
people need you.

537
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,956
You can use your mind creatively.

538
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,632
- I noticed you don't study hard.
- Bingo.

539
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,708
Yeah, but if I stay,
what should I do?

540
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,112
First, get even with Kent.
It's a moral imperative.

541
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,559
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

542
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,839
Now, you try it.

543
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,472
- Now, let's unpack.
- Right.

544
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,432
That's what makes Darlington
so sweet.

545
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,195
- But Knight's got it locked.
- Maybe, maybe not.

546
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,073
Come on, you guys.
He's gone.

547
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,390
- Kent's name is on his plates.
- Like my underwear.

548
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,189
You have license plates
in your underwear?

549
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,473
Hey, Kent.

550
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,238
That's your car.

551
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,395
- You're not supposed to park on campus.
- This isn't funny.

552
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,236
- You've gone too far.
- I had help.

553
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,272
You, huh?

554
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,954
Dr. Hathaway's gonna hear about this.
You'll rue the day!

555
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,119
"Rue the day"?
Who talks like that?

556
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,956
Wow. Hello.

557
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,392
Hi.

558
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,992
Jerry asked me to drop by.
What about you?

559
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,590
- What?
- Which word didn't you understand?

560
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,796
- You here for the meeting?
- Meeting?

561
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,679
- I don't know.
- Okay.

562
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,631
- Look, I'm just waiting.
- Great.

563
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,430
If you can't do it,
we'll get somebody else.

564
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,071
- I have a timetable.
- We're close, everything'll be fine.

565
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,596
Remember, you work for me.
I've made my point.

566
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,389
- Crystal clear.
- Anything I should know about?

567
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,957
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Goodbye, Jerry. Susan.

568
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:45,554
I guess this is goodbye. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to know you.

569
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,510
Have you ever
seen a body like this before?

570
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,594
- She's my daughter.
- Well, then I guess you have.

571
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,395
- Coming, Don?
- Yeah.

572
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,153
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

573
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,113
...or to you,
you let me know.

574
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,475
- Can you hammer a nail with your penis?
- Not now.

575
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,270
A girl's gotta have her standards.

576
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,589
- Smart girl.
- What're you doing?

577
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,559
- You said come over.
- Stay off the rug.

578
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,198
Take off your shoes.

579
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,516
- What's up, doc?
- Sit down.

580
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,638
- Who were they?
- You're of no use to me!

581
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,555
- Interesting way to start.
- I'm giving Kent the job.

582
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,957
- You gave me the job.
- You need a degree.

583
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,039
- I'll pass your exam.
- Even if you pass, you don't pass.

584
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,400
- Why don't you leave right now?
- I'll go to Dr. Meredith.

585
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,397
- The work I've done merits a degree.
- Who will he believe, you or me?

586
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,119
- You can't do this.
- It's done. Now get out!

587
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,834
You'll never work in this field.

588
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,277
- You unbelievable bastard.
- Count on it.

589
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,112
What're you doing?

590
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,436
I was thinking of the immortal
words of Socrates, who said:

591
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,911
"I drank what?"

592
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,271
Is there something wrong?

593
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,434
Hathaway is going
to flunk me out of school.

594
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,555
- Why?
- I screwed up.

595
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,558
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll leave.

596
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,149
You can't!
You'll be a failure!

597
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,399
Thank you, Mitch.

598
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,871
You just can't leave.
You owe me ten bucks.

599
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,233
You can't quit.

600
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,028
If for no other reason than
to see a five-megawatt laser fire.

601
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,311
That would be nice.

602
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,397
- Finish what you start.
- Who said that?

603
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,358
You know that.

604
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,870
That's right, Mitch.
But that's no way to motivate someone.

605
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,034
You've got to get even
with Hathaway.

606
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,191
It's a moral imperative.

607
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,069
That's a good point.

608
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,832
Vito, not again.

609
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,040
Why don't you get some sleep.

610
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,354
It's not like we're driving or
anything. You're still a growing boy.

611
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,479
Hey, Lazlo.

612
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,672
Lazlo?

613
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,554
That's me.
Hello.

614
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,390
I've been watching you.

615
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,832
Thanks.

616
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:50,236
I thought I'd help, so I found
every question Hathaway's asked...

617
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,790
...on every final he's given.

618
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,719
Gee, I didn't get you anything.

619
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,399
Are those they?

620
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,999
No.

621
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,919
These are sweepstakes entries.

622
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,038
Enter as often as you want,
so I am.

623
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,038
That's great!
How many times?

624
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,394
Well, this batch makes it 1,650,000.

625
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,195
I should win 32.6% of the prizes,
plus the car.

626
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,631
That takes the fun out of it,
doesn't it?

627
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,193
They set up the rules, and I realized
I have certain materialistic needs.

628
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,114
So...

629
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,036
Where are the questions?

630
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,996
I memorized them.

631
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,468
Sure.

632
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,679
I gotta go to sleep.

633
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,315
Did you wanna borrow my pajamas?

634
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,632
No, thanks.

635
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,911
- Hey, he's a pretty smart kid.
- Yeah.

636
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,519
He'll grow five inches
in the next year.

637
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,200
- Mitch?
- Jordan?

638
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,196
Mitch Taylor?

639
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,668
Who...

640
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,596
My name is Sherry Nugil.
I've waited three years for this.

641
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,798
- For what?
- For you to be old enough.

642
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,555
- For what?
- For this.

643
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,273
Come in!

644
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,190
Hi, Mitch!
I'm just sanding my floor!

645
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,152
Could you turn that off a second?!

646
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,390
How come you're so sweaty?

647
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,713
I came back from helping Chris,
and a woman was in my room.

648
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,313
- Pardon?
- A woman. You know, she was an adult.

649
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,275
Well, she wanted to...

650
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,869
- How can I say this?
- Jump you?

651
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,911
- Yeah.
- You made it?

652
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,275
- No. That's what was unbelievable.
- Pardon?

653
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,037
I stopped her.
I told her I didn't want to.

654
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,157
Why?

655
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,593
Because I really did want to.

656
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,430
I wanted to,
but not with her.

657
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,399
Oh.

658
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,508
- This is my class hour!
- It's May 10th.

659
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,550
- What are you doing here?
- Me?! What are you doing here?

660
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,837
Decker is dangerous!
Where's the laser?

661
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,640
- Coming.
- It's not even breathing hard.

662
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,394
He wants it
by the end of the week!

663
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,512
Now you listen to me!
You grovelling bug!

664
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,719
I have exams! I'm doing what I can,
so get off my back!

665
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,915
That should just about do the trick,
as long as you stay cool.

666
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,393
- Let's go, girls.
- What does that mean?

667
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,718
It's a figure of speech.
You guys coming to the exam?

668
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,476
I guess, since Hathaway's
gone to the trouble of having one.

669
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,870
You coming, buddy boy?

670
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,193
I'll catch up.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

671
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,837
I don't think that's gonna
help your confidence any, do you?

672
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,676
Buddy boy.

673
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,949
Let's see how funny you think this is.

674
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,152
Buddy boy.

675
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,231
All right, we...

676
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,475
We have exactly three hours.

677
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,951
And remember,
we believe in the honour system.

678
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:41,917
It'll be apparent how many of you
haven't absorbed this material.

679
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,833
Take one,
like your IQ was normal.

680
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,957
Good luck, buddy boy.

681
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:52,951
Can I name my first child after you?
"Dipshit Knight" has a nice ring.

682
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,434
No. No!

683
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,953
No!

684
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,392
My condolences on your meltdown.

685
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,556
What meltdown, Kent?

686
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,591
I'm not saying that you had one,
because how would I know?

687
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,910
But just in case you do.

688
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,039
- You slime.
- It's your own fault.

689
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,275
Didn't anyone ever tell you
to make sure your optics are clean?

690
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,390
I can do it!
How does it feel to be frozen?!

691
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,870
Ice is nice!

692
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,436
- Lazlo, buddy! Seen Mitch?
- No.

693
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,838
He's not in there.

694
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,510
- How'd you do?
- I passed! But I failed!

695
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,951
Well, then I'm happy and sad for you.

696
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,435
Gotta find Mitch.
Mitch!

697
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,591
He's not in the toilet.

698
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,799
I'll freeze it and get
at least an order of magnitude.

699
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,879
Because it's gonna be frozen.
I think I can do it.

700
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,308
Bye!

701
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,994
Hey, man!
You're not Mitch.

702
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,876
Hey, Lazlo!
Wanna see a demonstration of gravity?

703
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,790
It can be done!
That's a window! That's a door!

704
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:32,028
Mitch!
Where's your math!?

705
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,799
Hey, you jerk!

706
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,992
I'm very sorry.
I'll buy you a car.

707
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,913
I don't have one.
It's my dad's.

708
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,635
How's it going, Jerry?

709
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,239
What do you want?

710
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,472
World peace,
but this isn't the time.

711
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,757
- Get out!
- This might interest you.

712
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,520
- I'm not interested.
- Dr. Hathaway...

713
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,149
Susan.

714
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,114
I solved the power problem, Jerry.

715
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,438
- Jerry?
- Take a cab.

716
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,319
So you'll hammer later.

717
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,877
We were working
on the cyanide system.

718
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,908
Well, earlier today,
it ate itself.

719
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,517
But that's just what we needed
to take a giant step forward.

720
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,239
Right, Kent?

721
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,390
Needless to say,
I was despondent about the meltdown.

722
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,115
In the midst of my preparations
for hari-kari...

723
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,157
...it came to me.

724
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,512
It's possible to synthesize
bromide in an argon matrix.

725
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,555
- Excimers, frozen in an excited state.
- That's impossible.

726
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,070
It's a chemical laser,
but solid, not gaseous.

727
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:18,990
Put simply, in deference to Kent,
it's like lasing dynamite.

728
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,513
We couple it to a state that is
radiatively coupled to the ground.

729
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,676
Extracting 10-to-the-21 st
protons per cubic centimetre...

730
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,438
...will give 1 kilojoule per cubic
centimetre, or a megajoule per litre.

731
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,914
Hotter than the sun.

732
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,270
- It's small.
- It's meant to be.

733
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,948
We only have the one sample...

734
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,512
...and it's going to destroy itself
as it lases.

735
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,315
But everything will be fine.

736
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,639
- Right, Mitch?
- Yeah.

737
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,189
This is a complete waste of time.

738
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,154
Kent, put the target
in front of the cinder blocks.

739
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,909
Okay, come behind the shield.

740
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,432
Okay, Mr. Taylor.
Any time you're ready.

741
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,719
Ready? Laser on!

742
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,711
All right!

743
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,879
Look at this!

744
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,918
Wow!

745
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,792
- Sorry about the window.
- And the trees across the quad!

746
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,839
You did it.

747
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,359
I did my part too.

748
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,189
You graduate.
You get the job.

749
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,428
What? You can't!
That's my job.

750
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,116
I've done everything
you've ever asked me to.

751
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,440
I teach your classes for you!

752
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,712
- I get your laundry!
- What is he doing?

753
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,432
I mounted the optics
for the target-tracking system.

754
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,710
Look!

755
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,440
Wait. Wait.

756
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,592
- Let's celebrate!
- Absolutely.

757
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,870
You see anything unusual
on the campus?

758
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,112
- My glasses!
- Well, try not to wobble.

759
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,235
- There is a complete hole.
- That's great.

760
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,998
Look.

761
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,159
Let's get a burger.

762
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,675
- Let's go!
- In there?

763
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,232
This place is wild.

764
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,993
- Do you see that?
- Like her? She's from Playa del Rey.

765
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,873
- Am I gonna meet your parents?
- No.

766
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,671
- Why? Are you ashamed of me?
- No, them.

767
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,152
Remember the right people
to thank on this.

768
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,630
- I'd like to thank my fish.
- What?!

769
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,673
- And Mr. Ikagami!
- I love it.

770
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,113
What are you saying?

771
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,039
Lazlo!

772
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,558
I'm glad you came out.
Want a hamburger?

773
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,236
I've been thinking about
your laser solution.

774
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,998
- You've increased it to 6 megawatts.
- Yeah, about that.

775
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,836
- What would you use it for?
- Enormous Swiss cheese?

776
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,153
It can do anything.

777
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,558
No. The beam would last for what,
15 seconds?

778
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,277
- What good is that?
- I respect you, but I graduated.

779
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,637
Let the engineers figure that out.

780
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,110
Maybe it already has a use...

781
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,874
...for which it's designed.

782
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,350
Hathaway has something in mind?

783
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:43,155
Look at the facts.
Very high power, portable...

784
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,035
...limited firing time,
unlimited range.

785
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:50,073
With a tracking system
and a mirror...

786
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,953
...you could vaporize
a human from space.

787
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,715
This is not good.

788
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,393
No!

789
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,711
What happened?

790
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,952
Oh, no.

791
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,390
- Chris.
- I'm all right.

792
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,791
- They took everything.
- Kent's tracking system is gone!

793
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,959
How could you build that mirror?!

794
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,510
He lied to us.

795
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,038
It's easy to lie to you, Mitch.

796
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,034
You trust people.

797
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,030
I'm a cynic.

798
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,711
I'm such an asshole.

799
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,872
I understand how you feel.
You're right.

800
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,356
But we need to find out
what he's doing.

801
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,079
Kent.

802
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,476
Shh, you guys!

803
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,598
- We'll have two minutes.
- Pardon?

804
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,551
- Hi.
- Hi.

805
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,315
Okay, open his mouth.

806
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,951
Bulldogs.

807
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,271
And transceiver.

808
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,476
And tweezers.

809
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,080
The braces gave me the idea.

810
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,278
Perfect antennae.
His head becomes a speaker.

811
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,796
It's about time someone
put it to good use.

812
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,077
Kent?

813
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,513
<i>Kent.
Wake up, Kent.</i>

814
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,874
<i>- Kent.
- What?</i>

815
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,317
<i>I'm talking to you, Kent.</i>

816
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,469
<i>- What is this?
- I said, I'm talking to you.</i>

817
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,234
- No.
- Yeah.

818
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,074
Well, I'm not asleep.

819
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,833
<i>- I must be overworked.
- You're not overworked, Kent.</i>

820
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,315
Well, I'm not insane!

821
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,039
<i>- Or am I?
- That remains to be seen, Kent.</i>

822
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,590
But we are having a conversation.

823
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,550
<i>- Okay, who is this?
- This is Jesus, Kent.</i>

824
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,912
And you've been a very naughty boy!

825
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,357
All right, who is this?

826
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,677
- Cut the crap. You built a weapon.
- What?

827
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:34,233
What do you think a secret phase
conjugate tracking system is for?

828
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,358
<i>A big mirror makes a big beam.</i>

829
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,236
I guess it could be.

830
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,119
Where's the laser now?

831
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:52,396
I overheard Jerry mention something
about a test on the 27th.

832
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,558
<i>But I don't know where.
It's classified.</i>

833
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,630
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

834
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,038
I want you to think about
what you've done, Kent.

835
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,389
And from now on...

836
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,434
<i>...stop playing with yourself!</i>

837
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,034
It is God.

838
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,592
Now what?

839
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,079
Phase two.

840
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,034
What is it with you?

841
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,794
What's that?

842
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,876
- These military are so untrusting.
- Can we get clearance?

843
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,636
- We will. It'll just take six hours.
- Forget it. We'll balls it.

844
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,478
How do these look?

845
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,592
Mine looks like him,
and his looks like me.

846
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,639
Great, I hope.

847
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,559
- What if they don't work?
- They shoot us.

848
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,319
I. D?

849
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,913
- Show these to the next guard.
- You bet.

850
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,794
I.D. s?

851
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:58,671
Can you snap it up?
We're late, we're tired, we're hungry.

852
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,070
- Are you crazy?
- You gotta intimidate these guys.

853
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,118
You're not on the list.

854
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,272
Yeah, that's because we're classified.

855
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,352
Security.

856
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,995
Aren't you young for technicians?

857
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,316
Lasers are a young science.

858
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,830
There, I said it.
Now we're both in trouble.

859
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:28,198
- I'll call the duty officer.
- Hey there, Airborne.

860
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:38,400
Make that call, and it's our jobs.
We're four hours late.

861
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,952
Give us a break. Someday you'll
be in the private sector.

862
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,230
Yeah.

863
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,556
We're dead.

864
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,236
- All right!
- I love it!

865
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,749
Absolutely, sir.
Consider it done.

866
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,797
Yes, sir.

867
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,428
Look for anything
out of the ordinary.

868
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,035
Mitch, come here.

869
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,519
My God.

870
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,519
Come on.

871
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,237
- Communication link?
- Open.

872
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,830
Diagnostics seem okay.
Final check ready.

873
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,958
Sixty-five degrees, nineteen minutes.

874
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,869
All systems go.
We're finished here, fellas.

875
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,108
What!?

876
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,349
This little polynomial will
keep the computer busy.

877
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,029
Where are they?

878
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,433
We've got a connection!
They're in!

879
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,950
<i>- Abbott to Costello.
- Go ahead.</i>

880
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,909
<i>- We've got the goodies.
- We've got target coordinates.</i>

881
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,678
Roger, we're sending.

882
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,270
What is it?

883
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,113
Oh, nothing.

884
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,878
You didn't think we'd
test in space?

885
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:41,318
Yes, I did, because
that's what it was designed for.

886
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,235
But if you want to crawl
before we walk...

887
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,517
...that's fine too.
Really.

888
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,792
- Attention!
- What?

889
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,958
- Superior officer in the room!
- As you were.

890
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,556
We're ready for the final
on-board laser check.

891
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,033
All clear.

892
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,312
I'm replacing the PROM
with our EPROM.

893
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,112
Okay, shoot.

894
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:29,031
May I have the coordinates, please?

895
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,469
34 degrees, 10 minutes.
15.21 seconds north.

896
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:39,951
119 degrees, 7 minutes...

897
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,472
Right this way.

898
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,070
I'm gonna check the stairs.

899
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,959
Hathaway's coming!

900
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,909
Mitch has told me that
Herr Professor is approaching.

901
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,350
- What now?
- Hathaway's coming.

902
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,110
I don't work well under pressure.

903
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,277
Watch your head there.

904
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,028
I hope that works.

905
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,114
Okay, Chris, I mean, Abbott.
Hello? Hello?

906
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,157
They're gone!

907
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,794
- Okay. Fine.
- Fine.

908
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,989
Dr. Goy can answer
any questions you might have.

909
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,431
Is there any problem
with reusing the weapon?

910
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:48,869
No, the fuel is frozen
and contains a self-sufficient unit.

911
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,356
The beauty of this system is...

912
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,919
- Is everything all right here?
- Why shouldn't it be?

913
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,837
I think that
just about sums it up.

914
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,355
Shall we take our exit?

915
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,239
- Okay, they're gone.
- That was close.

916
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,039
Nothing like borrowing a B-1,
huh, general?

917
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,548
What is it?

918
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,955
Nothing.

919
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:43,356
Diagnosis of schizophrenia
by objective personal analysis...

920
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,036
<i>Hi, Kent.</i>

921
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,028
Oh, I thought you'd gone.

922
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,829
<i>Not yet.
Have you been touching yourself?</i>

923
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,516
Yes. I mean, no!

924
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,672
<i>Good.
Listen, Kent.</i>

925
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,957
<i>Dad, you know, God,
wants to show you something.</i>

926
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,555
Why?
I meant what?

927
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,558
I've learned not to ask.

928
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,349
He says to wait in front of
Dr. Hathaway's house...

929
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,596
<i>...at 639 Ivy Crest Drive,
at precisely 7:08 this morning.</i>

930
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,908
Ivy Crest?

931
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:29,234
<i>Wait there and you shall receive
a sign, but do not go inside.</i>

932
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,635
Well, why not?

933
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,388
Hello?

934
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,113
Hello, Jesus?

935
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,273
He hung up.

936
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,558
Crossbow One, radar contact,
heading 0-2-5.

937
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,036
Maintain flight level 6-5-0.

938
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:12,035
<i>Roger. Steer 0-2-5 out of five thousand
for flight level 6-5-0.</i>

939
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,797
They're here.

940
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:46,831
Mr. Knight, why is it that I am
not surprised to see you here?

941
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:53,030
I suppose you have an explanation
for this event that we're to witness.

942
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,831
First, let me compliment you
on your fashion sense.

943
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,315
Particularly your slippers.

944
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,356
Yes, well, Philomena likes them.

945
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,113
Hey, guys!

946
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,591
Good morning.

947
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,277
Congressman Doogan.
What brings you around?

948
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:19,758
I was told there was a situation
of international importance.

949
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:31,031
The weapon is controlled from
this module, as it would be in space.

950
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,352
This is an exact duplicate
of the cockpit.

951
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,750
The accuracy will be as exact.

952
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,239
<i>- We are nearing the target.
- Open the bomb bay doors.</i>

953
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,956
- Those are serious accusations.
- I know.

954
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,715
If it's true,
I'm going to need proof.

955
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:01,270
We can accommodate you
in just one minute.

956
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,476
Duck.

957
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,196
Congressman?

958
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,000
Now, listen to me, Jesus.

959
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:55,910
This is Jerry's house,
and we're very close.

960
01:31:56,120 --> 01:32:00,238
If you don't answer me,
I'm just gonna have to go in.

961
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,229
- So I'm going.
- No, Kent!

962
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,632
- Get away!
- Kent!

963
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,549
Target locked.
In ten.

964
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,639
<i>Nine.</i>

965
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,993
<i>E ight.</i>

966
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,832
- Kent!
- Come out, Kent!

967
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,554
Okay, God!
Let me have it!

968
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,114
Popcorn!

969
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,756
I don't understand.
Did it fire?

970
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,036
Yes, but there's a problem.

971
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:59,755
- It's not shutting down.
- Well, shut it down!

972
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,633
- What's the problem?
- Shut it down!

973
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,114
Kent!

974
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,557
Kent.

975
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,798
- Kent, you okay?
- That was great!

976
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,356
Something is very wrong.

977
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,676
Out!

978
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,511
Unlock the bird's-eye.

979
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,348
Unlocked.

980
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,513
I'm tracking where the shot went.
I want to know it worked.

981
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,639
Oh, no.

982
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:19,559
- My house.
- What have you done?

983
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,191
All right!

984
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,749
It's Hollyfeld...

985
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,678
...in a Winnebago!

986
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:00,350
Lazlo, buddy!

987
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,955
I think we used too much.

988
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:09,031
- I'm sorry you missed it.
- I had to pack.

989
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,629
- Why?
- Well, I'm getting married.

990
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,276
- To whom?
- What is all this stuff?

991
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,713
Oh, yeah. I won,
31.8% of the prizes.

992
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:22,918
I'll figure it out.
But not this summer.

993
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:27,109
Sherry?
Sherry Nugil?

994
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,473
Isn't it great?
This is number one.

995
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,710
I've been looking for him
for ten years.

996
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:47,153
- What can I say? She loves me.
- Congratulations.

997
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,273
- You'll have to come and visit us.
- What?

998
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:57,029
I have a little
survival place in Wyoming.

999
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,755
Yeah, it's getting
kinda weird around here.

1000
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,952
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1001
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,310
- Is it getting too weird around here?
- Absolutely.

1002
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,115
- I didn't notice.
- I like it.

1003
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,515
