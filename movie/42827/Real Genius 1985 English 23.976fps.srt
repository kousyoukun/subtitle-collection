1
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:25,250
Crossbow, this is Watchdog. Confirm transmissions.

2
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:31,254
Roger, Watchdog.
Crossbow is on Discriminator, and all systems are go.

3
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:37,928
Roger, we mark you go for maneuvering sequence.

4
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:44,095
Watchdog, this is Crossbow. Confirm we are go for arm.

5
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,828
Affirmative, Crossbow.

6
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:51,340
Select electrics to max, vents
to open, and systems to onboard.

7
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,014
-Roger. Crossbow is armed.
-Roger.

8
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,945
We have confirmation. Rabbit in the hole.

9
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,415
Moving Target Indicator, engaged.

10
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:04,715
-Pathfinder on. I'm going on the scope.
-Roger.

11
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,459
Scanner on.

12
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,693
Target locked.
Tracking locked.

13
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,197
-Roger.
-Easy does it. That's it.

14
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,461
Hold it right there.

15
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:37,115
The Crossbow Project.
There's no defense like a good offense.

16
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,226
Mission accomplished.

17
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:39,056
Mission accomplished.

18
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:44,060
-Outstanding, Crossbow.
-Just like shooting ducks in a barrel.

19
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:47,961
Our scientists are turning an engineering dream...

20
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:53,071
-...into an effective reality.
-- Now all we have to do is build it.

21
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:57,005
-Nice weapon, isn't it?
-What did you think of the movie, Roy?

22
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:00,305
I think there weren't enough girls in it!

23
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:04,483
I have a tape on alternate uses, mini-shuttle plans...

24
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:07,687
...and B-1 modifications for aerial launch.

25
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:10,857
Does the President, or any other responsible agency,
know about this?

26
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:14,425
It's on a need-to-know basis.
And the CIA is a responsible agency.

27
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:18,859
I think they do need to know.
You're gonna cause an escalation.

28
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:23,467
Our studies indicate this weapon is useless in warfare.

29
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:29,006
It's not for war. It's a peacetime weapon.
That's why it's secret.

30
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:33,338
-So it's both immoral and unethical?
-Yes.

31
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,707
-When do we get it?

32
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,353
There is a tiny technical problem with the energy source--

33
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:45,024
I don't want problems. We have plans for it this summer.

34
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:50,355
I need a success. l don't need any delays jeopardizing that.

35
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:53,693
-Am I making myself clear?
-Clear as vodka.

36
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,835
You tell that Dr. Hathaway to get on the stick.

37
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:02,134
-I'm gonna have to push harder.
-As long as we have a weapon by June.

38
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,071
-Right?
-l wouldn't know….

39
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,405
…I haven't had a working weapon since Korea!

40
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:11,040
I'm sorry, this is too much.

41
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:15,882
-I'm gonna ask for a reassignment.
-I'm sorry to hear that, George.

42
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:22,559
I urge you to stop.

43
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,493
Thanks for your input. Sorry you won't be on the team.

44
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,759
Maybe next time.

45
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:32,666
Too bad. Used to be a good man.

46
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm afraid we're gonna have to liberate George.

47
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,374
Liberate? You mean, liquidate?

48
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:49,955
Let's see that film on blinding techniques.
Then we'll have lunch.

49
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:12,075
-Could you sign this?
-Are you Doctor Hathaway?

50
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,981
-I just loved your television show.
-Thank you. That's very kind of you.

51
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,222
-What is Mr. Einstein really like?
-Dead.

52
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:30,829
Dad, laser means light amplification
by stimulated emissions of radiation.

53
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:33,396
So this is coherent light.

54
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:37,070
-Oh, so it talks, right?
-No.

55
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,263
-Dr. Hathaway, what a surprise!
-How are you?

56
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:45,309
Is something wrong with the test scores?
If there is, it's because--

57
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:48,573
I thought I'd bring you the news myself.

58
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:53,412
I got word from admissions. Mitch is in at Pacific Tech.

59
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,281
-Wonderful!
-Way to go!

60
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:57,150
Don't shake his head!

61
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,017
-How you doing?
-Fine.

62
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,591
-Nice display here.
-Thanks.

63
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,755
It's a flash lamp ultraviolet laser at 342 nanometers.

64
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,666
As you know, there is interest in the iodine laser for fusion.

65
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:16,308
This is molecular iodine.
This laser doesn't suffer from recombination.

66
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,444
You must be proud.

67
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,874
-Proud?
-Sure.

68
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:23,948
He's the first student we've accepted for winter term.

69
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:29,316
-I bet he's the youngest too.
-The youngest was 12.

70
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:31,787
He cracked under the pressure--

71
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:35,120
He's 15. There won't be any problem.

72
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:40,290
Listen, about the scholarship….
You're gonna give him a bonus, right?

73
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:44,495
No... But by allowing Mitch to progress
at a quicker rate...

74
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:49,335
...we give him the chance to fill
a greater portion of his potential.

75
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:54,913
We want the best for Mitchie.
I saw your show on radioactive isotopes.

76
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,640
-And I've got a question.
-Yes?

77
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,376
-Is that your real hair?
-Yeah?

78
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,855
-Tell me, is Mitch adopted?
-Why, no!

79
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:05,922
-It's amazing.
-Isn't it?

80
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,424
I need something to eat. Come on.

81
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,756
-Bye, Dr. Hathaway.
-Goodbye.

82
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,831
See you later, honey.

83
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,337
They're okay. Sometimes they
don't know what I'm talking about.

84
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:25,204
I'm sure about that.
Tell me, are you gonna miss your friends?

85
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:29,008
-No, I think I intimidate other kids.
-Good boy.

86
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:35,180
Understand, compared to you, most
people have the IQ of a carrot.

87
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:38,756
We're different from most people. Better. I'm--

88
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,089
-There you are, doctor!
-Hi. Yes, one second.

89
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:48,267
I've put you on my research team
with the best minds. This is only...

90
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:53,473
-...the second time for a freshman.
-The first was Chris Knight, right?

91
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:56,733
-You've heard of him?
-He's a physics legend.

92
00:08:56,944 --> 00:09:02,439
You'll be working with him.
He's a senior now, as brilliant as ever.

93
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,741
Wow!

94
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:09,814
-This job will be waiting, Chris.
-Great.

95
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:13,720
-We have a physical plant here.
-You have a Jacuzzi?

96
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,418
-Absolutely.
-Good.

97
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:20,430
And the labs and offices are over this way.
Follow me, please.

98
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:31,903
Guys!

99
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:36,276
-Meet Chris Knight. This is Sherry.
-Pleased to meet you.

100
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:39,247
-This is Mike Dodd.
-Dr. Dodd?

101
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:44,152
-He designed our new Telcom satellite.
-It's an honor to meet you.

102
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,085
Telcom….

103
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,591
The satellite raining debris all over Europe?

104
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,594
Why is that on your head?

105
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:54,801
If I wear it anywhere else, it chafes.

106
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:58,802
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was stuffy.

107
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,169
You know, no fun. All brain, no penis.

108
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:05,476
-Pardon me?
-I'm sorry.

109
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,443
It's an infantile response to authority.

110
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,881
-You are Chris Knight?
-I hope so. I'm wearing his underwear.

111
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,112
It's a joke! I get it!
Funny!

112
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,654
I can't help it.
You're such fun.

113
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,987
We try to be. Isn't that right, Mike?

114
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,027
No.

115
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:30,296
Sherry's gonna show you around.
Ask questions about benefits, dress codes.

116
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:33,473
-I'll see you in my office later.
-Great.

117
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:38,805
Take care of him.
He's one of the ten finest minds in the country!

118
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,743
Someday I hope to be two of them.

119
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,309
-You are beautiful.
-Thanks.

120
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,044
Did I come off stuffy?

121
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:51,349
You don't act like one of the top ten minds.

122
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,060
-How many have you met?
-Seven.

123
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:56,593
-Really?
-You'll be eight.

124
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:00,725
Professor Hostetler was number six.

125
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:04,198
Old Professor Hostetler? Isn't he dead?

126
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,934
He is now.

127
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:17,249
Hello. I'm looking for the Freshman Tea.

128
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:21,012
Oh, good. I'm so glad we have one then.

129
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,888
-I don't think so.
-Gene.

130
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:29,084
-This is Mitch Taylor.
-Hathaway's bright star.

131
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:32,298
-Yes, sir.
-You're already on his project.

132
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,036
-We expect great things from you.
-I hope so.

133
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,866
-A bit of advice.
-Oh, thank you.

134
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,437
Always--

135
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,146
Never--… forget to check your references.

136
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,048
Okay. Thank you.

137
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:54,777
I better be going. Sorry.

138
00:11:56,223 --> 00:12:00,592
The young people enjoy it when I ''get down'' verbally.

139
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:04,493
Where's the funeral?

140
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:18,274
How you doing, sport?

141
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:23,681
Hey, Bobby, wait up, man!

142
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:29,516
See if he's in his room. He might be in there.

143
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:07,490
Hello?

144
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:18,900
-What kind of place is this?
-Hi.

145
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:23,142
Would you be prepared if gravity reversed itself?

146
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:27,907
I can't figure out how to keep change in my pocket.

147
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,980
I've got it! Nudity!

148
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,813
I was here earlier--

149
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:36,079
-You didn't straighten up?
-No.

150
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:41,522
Good. All my filth is in alphabetical order.
This was under ''H'' for toy.

151
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:42,922
What is that?

152
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:45,324
It's a penis stretcher.

153
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:46,829
-Wanna try it?
-No!

154
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:53,731
I'm kidding. It's another diversion
in an attempt to avoid responsibility.

155
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,498
I left my bags. Now they're empty.

156
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,276
You see, Mitch, l used to be you.

157
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:09,082
I've been missing me, so I asked
if I could room with me again.

158
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:12,348
I put your stuff in the bottom drawer.

159
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,051
I couldn’t find a place for the sports-jacket…
…so I threw it out.  -- Duck!

160
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:20,724
Nice reflexes. I'm Chris Knight.

161
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,028
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes. Duck again!

162
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:32,370
Oh, my God! It's heading for the gas tanks. Duck!

163
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,479
Was that a launch problem or a design problem?

164
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:43,715
-We're falling behind.
-We're not making sandwiches.

165
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,317
Get down!

166
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:49,662
Are you crazy? You could have killed us!

167
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:52,397
I cannot be seen with you.

168
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:56,160
But since I'm driving, shouldn't you be hiding?

169
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,497
He saw me.

170
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:04,502
The climate has changed. We need a
working model in four months, not eighteen.

171
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:08,004
You can't dictate innovation, Don.

172
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,011
I'll put it another way.

173
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,651
-You know the money for development?
-Yes.

174
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:19,291
When a project gets cut off, the
finance boys always run an audit.

175
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,586
I see.

176
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:29,527
Having a little work done on the old place, Jer?
Fraud is a felony.

177
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,042
What are you looking at? You're laborers! So labor!

178
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,645
….That's what you get for not having an education.

179
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:46,615
Get out of here!
Go on! Get out!

180
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,382
-Got it!
-Yeah!

181
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:03,900
Are you two--?

182
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,229
-Hey!
-Yes?

183
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:07,963
-Put down the sandwiches and go.
-Me?

184
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,666
-No, Yoda. Yeah, you!
-Just a bit.

185
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,709
-I don't have any--
-Brains?

186
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,471
-No. Sandwiches.
-What good are you?

187
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:19,209
-What will we eat?
-Are you from the restaurant?

188
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,652
No! I'm Mitch Taylor. I'm a student.
Dr. Hathaway told me to come up here.

189
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:30,526
So you're the new stud, are you?

190
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,223
-How do you mean?
-Stud. Hotshot. Brain.

191
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:38,370
-You're 12, right?
-I'm 15. Are you expecting him--?

192
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,905
Yeah. Can I get you something?

193
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:45,873
-A balloon?
-I'm supposed to check over your work.

194
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:48,946
-Check it over?
-Well, yes.

195
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,275
-For what?
-Mistakes, I guess.

196
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:57,081
-He said you guys were stuck.
-No! Let's get something clear here.

197
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,886
Okay, when Jerry's not here, you do what I say.

198
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:06,122
It goes from God to Jerry to me. Get it?

199
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:09,561
Hello, Jerry.

200
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,897
-You don't get to use my first name.
-Did I?

201
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,371
How you doing, Mitch? I'm sure you'll all be friends.

202
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:20,443
-We're on our way.
-Good.

203
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:24,047
I want you to take your cues from Mitch.

204
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:27,981
His ideas are the most original I've seen.

205
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:32,122
-So Mitch is in charge of the group.
-Really, Jerry?

206
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:34,917
-You're doing it again.
-Oh, am I?

207
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:40,464
-Where is Knight?
-He didn't bother to come in today.

208
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,227
-Yes?
-He said he didn't feel like it.

209
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,237
I said, ''You better or you'll be in trouble.'' He said, ''Jam it!''

210
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,776
-Great. You're not stuttering.
-I give myself shock treatments.

211
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,311
Up the voltage.

212
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:58,006
-I'm sorry he's not here--
-That clown? Look!

213
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,981
Kent decided to start without him.

214
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:05,022
The yield's insignificant. We think the sample's damaged.

215
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,920
-What?
-Obviously the result of negligence.

216
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,657
It'll take a week to prepare a new sample. I was afraid of this.

217
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:16,459
-Are you sure?
-We're sure. Positive.

218
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,695
-Excuse me.
-There is no excuse for it.

219
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:24,307
-Yeah, Mitch, what is it?
-The pump laser is down.

220
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:26,341
Look.

221
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:32,212
There.

222
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,819
Well, it seems to be all better now.

223
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:38,957
Don't touch other people's things!

224
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:42,628
-Kent, I need you.
-Anything, Jerry.

225
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:46,663
What? Do you want me to teach your class for you?

226
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:50,963
No, I need you to get copies of all the data so far.

227
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,504
So Mitch can check everything tomorrow.

228
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,303
-My pleasure.
-After that, stop by my cleaners.

229
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,536
Don't give it a thought.

230
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:04,148
-Mitch, shall we? On the moment.
-Sure.

231
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:14,687
Well, I guess it goes from God, to Jerry, to you...

232
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:17,226
...to the cleaners.

233
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:19,988
Right, Kent?

234
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:27,273
Library. Library.... 205.

235
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:41,914
Welcome to Pacific Tech's ''Smart People on Ice.''

236
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:47,290
Let's go skating.

237
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,086
Ick, the ice turned out great!

238
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:53,526
Yeah, it worked, didn't it?

239
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,598
-How did you do it?
-Sure….

240
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:01,865
…I tell you, you tell somebody else,
next thing you know, we're in another ice age.

241
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:06,468
-Everybody must be skating.
-You're a slack!

242
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,977
-Moles and trolls.
-What?

243
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:12,583
Moles and trolls. Work-work. We never see daylight.

244
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:16,983
We plan for weeks and all they do is study. I'm disgusted.

245
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm sorry, but it's not like me. I'm depressed.

246
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,888
We had one entry for the Madame Curie look-alike contest...

247
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:31,093
...and he was disqualified later. Why do I bother?

248
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:34,569
Let's go! What are you, a bunch of weirdos?

249
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:39,245
-Want a cherry? I grow them myself.
-What?

250
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:42,746
Okay, push once.

251
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:49,580
Are you okay?

252
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:54,454
No, not emotionally. I'm disappointed. Not terribly.

253
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:57,186
It should have gone further, faster.

254
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,865
The problem is obviously the drag coefficient.

255
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:04,660
I'll have to redesign the blades. I can do that….

256
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:08,135
But I've got to cut them, and that takes time.

257
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,538
-How long will this last?
-Maybe a half an hour.

258
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,803
That's great. I can do that.

259
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,345
-Okay. What's your name?
-Mitch.

260
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:19,050
Thanks for your help.
See you later.

261
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,946
You're welcome!

262
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:22,712
-Who was that?
-That--

263
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:27,188
I'm Jordan. l heard there was someone new. Are you it?

264
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:28,520
Yes.

265
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,456
-Do you have a bed?
-Yeah.

266
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,067
I'd make you one, but you have one.
Okay, see you later. Bye.

267
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,167
Bye.

268
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:42,865
-What's all this?
-This? This is ice.

269
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,977
This is what happens when water gets cold.

270
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:51,550
This is Kent. This is what happens
when people get sexually frustrated.

271
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,517
This should keep you busy.

272
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:58,520
This with your classes should turn your brain to mush.

273
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:03,024
That's unfair. And we were gonna make you carnival king.

274
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:05,390
Yeah?

275
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:09,066
Ha, ha. You're in on this too.
Did you make it?

276
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,669
-I'm not saying.
-Who'll clean it?

277
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:16,204
You don't have to. It's gonna go directly to gas.

278
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,843
Really? What is it?

279
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:21,603
All l can tell you is it's rare and unstable.

280
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,679
Just like you.

281
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,852
-You're degenerates.
-We are?

282
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:29,112
-I found you naked with Jell-O!
-You did not!

283
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:30,584
This is true.

284
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:33,951
I was hot, and I was hungry. Okay?

285
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,688
I got news for you, Knight.

286
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,797
-You're not first anymore.
-First what?

287
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:44,093
-Mitch beat your scores by 20 points.
-Yeah, you did?

288
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:48,104
-You think you're hot stuff, huh?
-No.

289
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,639
Maybe you are smarter than me.

290
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:53,471
But can you do this?

291
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:05,384
-Ick, what's happening with the ice?
-Open a window!

292
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,885
Ick, I'm melting!

293
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,890
-It worked!
-Neat!

294
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:17,263
-Now if we can keep it from exploding.
-Exploding? Oh, God.

295
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:23,337
Hey, Ick. You're just joking about exploding, right?

296
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,239
Ick? It's a joke, right?

297
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,583
Good morning. I saw you come in.
We met last night? I'm Jordan.

298
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,377
-I made you a sweater.
-Last night?

299
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,680
It's something l do. Hope the size is right.

300
00:24:44,924 --> 00:24:47,358
I used my brother as a comparison.

301
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,155
I went ahead and made you one, because I was up.

302
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:53,865
-Are you peeing?
-Yeah.

303
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,433
I never sleep. I drove my roommate nuts.

304
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,903
She's okay, but she had to transfer.
l don't know if that's my fault.

305
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:08,604
If you ever need to talk, let me know,
because I never sleep, okay?

306
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,611
-I will.
-Are you done?

307
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,852
-I can't start.
-Because I'm here?

308
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:15,952
I think so.

309
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:20,283
-Weird. Well, I have to go.
-Me too.

310
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,618
Bye.

311
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:31,129
Good morning!

312
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:44,545
-Chris?
-Morning.

313
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:48,151
You know, something strange happened this morning.

314
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:53,121
Was it a dream where you're standing in sun-god robes
on a pyramid...

315
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:57,660
...with a thousand naked women screaming
and throwing little pickles at you?

316
00:25:57,964 --> 00:25:59,124
No.

317
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:02,835
Why am I the only person that has that dream?

318
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,935
Is that liquid nitrogen?

319
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:12,570
-Coffee?
-No.

320
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:21,986
-What happened?
-There's a guy in our closet.

321
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,114
You've seen him too?

322
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,982
Who is he?

323
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:31,755
Hollyfeld.

324
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:34,660
-Why does he go in?
-Why do you go in?

325
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,928
To get my clothes. But that's not why he does.

326
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:41,937
Of course not. He’s twice your size
-- Your clothes would never fit him.

327
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:44,334
Yeah.

328
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,878
Think before you ask.

329
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:52,050
Twenty points higher and thinks
a big guy like that can wear his clothes.

330
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:16,912
--plus y, equals zero.

331
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,232
This is it!

332
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:07,315
Come on, get out of here! Get!

333
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,354
-You wanted to see me?
-Mr. Knight.

334
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:13,498
Right on time.
Unusual these days.

335
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:17,066
-You still run?
-Only when chased.

336
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:19,767
-What smells?
-Must be the dog.

337
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,700
-That's popcorn.
-I know.

338
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:26,242
Get it away from me. I hate popcorn.
Put it over there.

339
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,777
Now I know what to get you for your birthday.

340
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:33,952
I guess we're moving up in the world, eh?

341
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:37,087
-Very elegant.
-Try not to touch anything.

342
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:41,022
-Is this okay, sir?
-It's oak; it's not plywood.

343
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,752
-Quite a change from the old place.
-Shoes.

344
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:47,558
I want to see more of you in the lab.

345
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,359
Fine. I'll gain weight.

346
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,562
-You're very funny, Chris.
-Thanks, Jerry, we try.

347
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,934
You can sit.

348
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,271
When I brought you here, I thought you'd be an Einstein.

349
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:05,881
-You were on your way. Then?
-I got a haircut.

350
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:08,814
-You're disappointing me.
-And you me.

351
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:13,148
-Look, it's about our deal.
-I know, Jerry.

352
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,452
I've advanced your project more than anyone.

353
00:34:16,729 --> 00:34:19,721
Yesterday. What have you done for me today?

354
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,561
Well, uh....

355
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,162
I want five megawatts by mid-May.

356
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:36,142
I think you might be getting obsessive
about all this. I took in Mitch, okay?

357
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:40,279
He's coming along fine. He's working his guts out.

358
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:44,522
-So, what do you want?
-I want five megawatts by mid-May.

359
00:34:44,757 --> 00:34:49,626
Look, I don't care if you're arrogant or disrespectful.

360
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:53,263
But you're distracting Mitch. That I won't have.

361
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,527
The rules have changed. I want it by mid-May.

362
00:34:57,803 --> 00:35:03,673
Jerry, I think you're forgetting one little detail: I'm out of here.

363
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:06,310
I'm gone, I'm history. I'm Casper.

364
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:11,049
-I'm graduating.
-To graduate, you need my course.

365
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:14,719
I have a say about what you do and where you go.

366
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:18,852
So you and Mitch will spend every moment in the lab.

367
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:23,459
You will solve my power problem by my deadline.

368
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:32,168
lf you think that threatening me will make me
your slave, well,that’s where you're right…

369
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:35,704
…but I'm only saying this because I care.

370
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:41,378
There are decaffeinated brands
that are as tasty as the real thing.

371
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:44,309
I'm not kidding, Chris.

372
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:48,212
Neither am I, Jerry.

373
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,156
Hi, Mitch.

374
00:36:00,232 --> 00:36:01,722
Do me a favor.

375
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:05,994
Taste this.
Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.

376
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,904
What, too sweet?

377
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:12,440
-What is it?
-I don't know, it was in the lab.

378
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:16,506
Relax, it's just yogurt.

379
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,187
-Mitch, are you all right?
-No, I'm not.

380
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:27,451
This combination of cyanide is dumb.
This is the wrong direction.

381
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:33,290
Only you know how to use this garbage.
And I'm getting brain-fried.

382
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:38,094
I'll make it up to you. Let's just pause, put that down.

383
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,965
Let's just take a step back.

384
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,472
No, take a step forward.

385
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:49,544
Now, take a step back.
And a step forward. Then step back.

386
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:54,085
-Will you stop? I'm serious.
-Okay, I'm serious too.

387
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,654
Let's charge it up. Give me everything you got.

388
00:36:57,957 --> 00:37:03,452
-I gotta connect the capacitors.
-Okay, this is work time.

389
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:14,497
-How you doing?
-Fine. Don't rush me.

390
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:19,107
Okay, just take your time.
Everything's fine.

391
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:23,573
What is taking so long?

392
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,407
I'm coming.

393
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,184
Charging.

394
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,179
Shades.

395
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:41,022
-What are you doing?
-Waiting.

396
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:47,095
It's just the fuse. It'll be back on in a minute.

397
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:51,002
I shouldn't have used the building transformer.

398
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,169
But, more importantly, did we get a charge?

399
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,543
What'd you do?

400
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:00,951
-Wait!
-Come on, Sputnik.

401
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,112
You wanted help, so here we go.

402
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,793
-Beautiful minds.
-We have work.

403
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,620
We're going to work. Hard work.

404
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,128
This must've taken hours.

405
00:38:13,365 --> 00:38:14,696
Let's find out.

406
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,201
I told you they'd come back on.

407
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:25,841
-What's this?
-It's a laser beam, bozo.

408
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:29,172
-What's it for?
-Not what. Where.

409
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:33,317
-What?
-Follow it. It's a surprise.

410
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,479
Like it?

411
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:42,386
Hey, what's the beam splitter for?

412
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:48,025
What's the matter? Need everything spelled out for you?

413
00:38:51,837 --> 00:38:53,998
Come on, let's tan!

414
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:58,065
One for Mitch.

415
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:13,689
Come on in, the South Pacific calls you.

416
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:18,096
-Who're the girls?
-Not from around here.

417
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:21,623
-They're from a nearby college.
-Where?

418
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,392
The Wanda Trossler Beauty School.

419
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:27,437
-They're beauticians?
-Not yet.

420
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:31,633
-l don't know.
-Your genius might impress them.

421
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,868
I don't see how.

422
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:36,979
Given the type of guys you are...

423
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:43,245
...this may be your only chance in your entire lives...

424
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:45,548
...to have SEX!

425
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,919
Think about it.

426
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,849
Destiny! I've got her now.

427
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:30,159
Don't you know that eating that
can give you extremely large breasts?

428
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:33,098
Oh, my God. I'm too late!

429
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:46,218
Don't think I don't want my invention to work.

430
00:40:46,218 --> 00:40:49,346
Don't think I don't want my invention to work.

431
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:53,819
-The day's only so long.
-Ready to go.

432
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:57,359
Pushing me doesn't help.
Tell them that.

433
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:01,861
Start showing results or they'll find somebody else.

434
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:05,399
-Oh, really?
-You won't have your big toys.

435
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:09,403
I'm the best.
Do you know who you're dealing with?

436
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,876
How dare you try this. I have to go on.

437
00:41:13,078 --> 00:41:16,673
This conversation is in incredibly poor taste.

438
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:19,712
-Son of a bitch.
-Asshole.

439
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,488
Welcome to Everything, with Jerome Hathaway.

440
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:31,685
Funded by a grant from Darlington Electronic Instruments.

441
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:35,856
Hi, I'm Jerry Hathaway, with Everything.

442
00:41:36,101 --> 00:41:42,199
Tonight, we'll look at something
that most of us take for granted.

443
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:46,541
The colon. What does it look like?

444
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,676
Get out of there.

445
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,672
-Kent!
-Cut!

446
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:56,583
-You're in front of the teleprompter.
-Well, I didn't know.

447
00:41:57,189 --> 00:42:00,056
-We need to talk.
-Get my laundry?

448
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,919
-Yes, but there's more.
-The gravy?

449
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:07,427
No, that came out.
Chris and Mitch, they're at a party.

450
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:09,724
With girls.

451
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,698
-I want you to show me.
-My pleasure.

452
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:57,445
-Hi, are you busy?
-Yes. No.

453
00:42:57,683 --> 00:43:01,642
Wanna help test my rebreather?
Come on!

454
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,410
Sure!

455
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:12,860
It's a simple principle. It's basically a filter.

456
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:17,592
It lets CO2 out and O2 back in, but no bubbles.

457
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:22,804
-How come you're not--?
-Necking? I'm not gay!

458
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,539
No, partying.

459
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:29,780
Because I'm 19 and I'm brilliant and hyperkinetic.

460
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,951
Guys are afraid. I guess I should be upset.

461
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,717
I think you're very nice.

462
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:42,854
I think you're nice too.

463
00:43:46,899 --> 00:43:49,299
Do you want to try this?

464
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:59,204
-It's lighter in the water.
-How about you?

465
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,821
Taylor!

466
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:22,423
-Why aren't you in the lab?
-I just--

467
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:25,365
You're here to work, not to play doctor.

468
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:28,335
-I got delayed.
-Where's Knight?

469
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:31,576
-You both make me sick.
-Kent!

470
00:44:33,745 --> 00:44:39,012
I took a chance recommending you.
I can see I made a mistake.

471
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:41,776
I hope you're proud of yourself.

472
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:50,121
-Dr. Hathaway?
-What?

473
00:44:50,696 --> 00:44:52,789
Are you wearing makeup?

474
00:44:54,766 --> 00:44:56,199
What?

475
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:33,161
I need one more course
to complete my humanities credits.

476
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:50,020
I'd like to make a collect call to Mrs. Bill Taylor.

477
00:45:50,522 --> 00:45:53,184
-Come on, come on.
-Mitch Taylor.

478
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,786
I got a great idea.

479
00:45:57,029 --> 00:45:58,587
-What?
-Hold it down!

480
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,492
Mom, I....

481
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,138
I want to come home.

482
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,438
-Are you there?
-Baby, you sound upset.

483
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:22,445
I don't like it here. I wanna come home.

484
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:26,286
You rented out my room?! To who?

485
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:29,494
Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.

486
00:46:42,307 --> 00:46:48,007
-Where were you last night?
-The lab, where you should've been.

487
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:55,976
Jordan said that Hathaway was mad.
What exactly did he--?

488
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:01,583
Let me hold that thought and get back to you.

489
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:11,400
-Are you there?
-Baby, you sound upset.

490
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:14,903
I don't like it here. I wanna come home.

491
00:47:15,107 --> 00:47:18,099
It's not for you to like, it's for you to do.

492
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:22,245
-You're 15 years old.
-I wanna come home.

493
00:47:22,514 --> 00:47:26,416
-You want to live with me and Daddy?
-Yeah.

494
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:31,421
-I'll go back to high school.
-We've rented out your room.

495
00:47:32,524 --> 00:47:35,584
-To who?
-Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.

496
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:39,353
We can share it. I don't wanna stay here.

497
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:45,928
-That doesn't sound like my soldier.
-Mitch, this is your dad.

498
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,398
-Hi, Dad.
-Are you crying?

499
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:53,110
-I'm sorry.
-I hope nobody sees.

500
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,940
-I'm a kid.
-You've never been just a kid.

501
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:25,672
If you wanna leave, go ahead.

502
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:30,077
But you're gonna miss the fun.

503
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,681
What fun?

504
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:35,513
Ick's releasing a new virus in Kent's room.

505
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:40,418
-The other night I needed your help.
-I helped you relax.

506
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:44,025
Being snubbed by beauticians is not relaxing.

507
00:48:44,262 --> 00:48:46,662
Student beauticians.

508
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:52,203
I thought this place was different. But it's the same.

509
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,372
In high school, I got put in a mailbox.

510
00:48:55,607 --> 00:48:58,337
Teachers hated me because I was smarter than them.

511
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:02,309
Students hated me because I blew the bell curve.

512
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:04,208
I was just like you.

513
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:08,544
I had white shirts and Hush Puppies and a briefcase.

514
00:49:08,787 --> 00:49:10,778
Girls never talked to me.

515
00:49:11,022 --> 00:49:14,890
When I got here, for three years I studied constantly.

516
00:49:16,228 --> 00:49:18,196
-You?
-Yeah.

517
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:22,690
One night, sitting right here, I had a vision.

518
00:49:22,968 --> 00:49:25,300
-What?
-Hollyfeld.

519
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:29,965
-The guy in the closet?
-Lazlo Hollyfeld.

520
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:34,236
I followed him into the closet, down into the tunnels.

521
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:38,405
There I saw the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

522
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,813
-What?
-Lazlo in his pajamas.

523
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:45,049
-So?
-So I talked to him.

524
00:49:45,323 --> 00:49:46,813
-You did?
-Yeah.

525
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:52,258
He was a stud around here in the '70s.
Smarter than us put together.

526
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:55,699
What happened? Did he crack?

527
00:49:55,934 --> 00:49:57,834
He cracked, severely.

528
00:49:58,103 --> 00:50:01,334
-Why?
-He loved his work.

529
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,540
-What's wrong with that?
-That's all he did.

530
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,077
He loved problems, he loved the answers.

531
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:14,546
But he thought that the answers
were the answers for everything.

532
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,180
All science, no philosophy.

533
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:22,587
One day, someone told him
the stuff he made was killing people.

534
00:50:24,129 --> 00:50:27,098
So, what? I'm gonna end up in a tunnel?

535
00:50:27,766 --> 00:50:29,631
-Yeah.
-What?

536
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:32,894
You are, if you keep up like this.

537
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:35,299
You don't need to run away.

538
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:38,940
When you're smart, people need you.

539
00:50:39,144 --> 00:50:42,580
You can use your mind creatively.

540
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:46,411
-I noticed you don't study hard.
-Bingo.

541
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:54,825
Yeah, but if I stay, what should I do?

542
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:59,462
First, get even with Kent. It's a moral imperative.

543
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:03,998
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

544
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:08,495
Now, you try it.

545
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:14,439
-Now, let's unpack.
-Right.

546
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:38,363
That's what makes Darlington so sweet.

547
00:51:38,603 --> 00:51:42,300
-But Knight's got it locked.
-Maybe, maybe not.

548
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:51,538
Come on, you guys.
He's gone.

549
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:03,316
-Kent's name is on his plates.
-Like my underwear.

550
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:07,292
You have license plates in your underwear?

551
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,308
Hey, Kent.

552
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,144
That's your car.

553
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:32,550
-You're not supposed to park on campus.
-This isn't funny.

554
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:36,527
-You've gone too far.
-I had help.

555
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:39,727
You, huh?

556
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:45,598
Dr. Hathaway's gonna hear about this.
You'll rue the day!

557
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:49,933
''Rue the day''?
Who talks like that?

558
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,349
Wow. Hello.

559
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,920
Hi.

560
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:16,926
Jerry asked me to drop by. What about you?

561
00:53:17,135 --> 00:53:20,696
-What?
-Which word didn't you understand?

562
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:22,964
-You here for the meeting?
-Meeting?

563
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,971
-I don't know.
-Okay.

564
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:30,110
-Look, I'm just waiting.
-Great.

565
00:53:30,448 --> 00:53:34,077
If you can't do it, we'll get somebody else.

566
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,949
-I have a timetable.
-We're close; everything'll be fine.

567
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:42,591
Remember, you work for me.
I've made my point.

568
00:53:42,827 --> 00:53:46,593
-Crystal clear.
-Anything l should know about?

569
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:51,293
-I'll be with you in a moment.
-Goodbye, Jerry. Susan.

570
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:58,170
I guess this is goodbye. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to know you.

571
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:03,347
Have you ever seen a body like this before?

572
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:07,574
-She's my daughter.
-Well, then I guess you have.

573
00:54:08,086 --> 00:54:10,577
-Coming, Don?
-Yeah.

574
00:54:12,323 --> 00:54:16,521
If there's ever anything I can do for you...

575
00:54:16,761 --> 00:54:19,662
...or to you, you let me know.

576
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:24,161
-Can you hammer a nail with your penis?
-Not now.

577
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:28,129
A girl's gotta have her standards.

578
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,675
-Smart girl.
-What're you doing?

579
00:54:33,945 --> 00:54:36,778
-You said come over.
-Stay off the rug.

580
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,542
Take off your shoes.

581
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:42,946
-What's up, doc?
-Sit down.

582
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:46,213
-Who were they?
-You're of no use to me!

583
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:50,291
-Interesting way to start.
-I'm giving Kent the job.

584
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:53,861
-You gave me the job.
-You need a degree.

585
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:58,126
-I'll pass your exam.
-Even if you pass, you don't pass.

586
00:54:58,403 --> 00:55:03,739
-Why don't you leave right now?
-I'll go to Dr. Meredith.

587
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:10,005
-The work I've done merits a degree.
-Who will he believe--you or me?

588
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,911
-You can't do this.
-It's done. Now get out!

589
00:55:16,154 --> 00:55:18,748
You'll never work in this field.

590
00:55:19,057 --> 00:55:22,390
-You unbelievable bastard.
-Count on it.

591
00:55:47,452 --> 00:55:49,283
What're you doing?

592
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:59,025
I was thinking of the immortal words of Socrates, who said:

593
00:55:59,597 --> 00:56:01,588
''I drank what?''

594
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:04,058
Is there something wrong?

595
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:08,430
Hathaway is going to flunk me out of school.

596
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,640
-Why?
-I screwed up.

597
00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:16,880
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll leave.

598
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:19,572
You can't! You'll be a failure!

599
00:56:21,486 --> 00:56:22,953
Thank you, Mitch.

600
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,793
You just can't leave. You owe me ten bucks.

601
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:38,468
You can't quit.

602
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:44,504
If for no other reason than to see a five-megawatt laser fire.

603
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:46,841
That would be nice.

604
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:52,178
-Finish what you start.
-Who said that?

605
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:54,180
You know that.

606
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:59,947
That's right, Mitch. But that's no way to motivate someone.

607
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,322
You've got to get even with Hathaway.

608
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:07,587
It's a moral imperative.

609
00:57:10,268 --> 00:57:12,668
That's a good point.

610
01:00:29,734 --> 01:00:31,565
Vito, not again.

611
01:00:42,713 --> 01:00:45,375
Why don't you get some sleep.

612
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:50,917
It's not like we're driving or anything.
You're still a growing boy.

613
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,255
Hey, Lazlo.

614
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,591
Lazlo?

615
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,696
…oh, that's me.
Hello.

616
01:01:07,505 --> 01:01:09,735
I've been watching you.

617
01:01:11,676 --> 01:01:13,268
Thanks.

618
01:01:14,779 --> 01:01:21,014
I thought I'd help, so I found
every question Hathaway's asked...

619
01:01:21,419 --> 01:01:23,683
...on every final he's given.

620
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,721
Gee, I didn't get you anything.

621
01:01:27,024 --> 01:01:28,514
Are those they?

622
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:32,228
No.

623
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,263
These are sweepstakes entries.

624
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,535
Enter as often as you want, so I am.

625
01:01:38,769 --> 01:01:41,636
That's great! How many times?

626
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:47,238
Well, this batch makes it 1,650,000.

627
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:51,211
I should win 32.6% of the prizes, plus the car.

628
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:54,782
That takes the fun out of it, doesn't it?

629
01:01:55,052 --> 01:02:00,581
They set up the rules; and lately I’m beginning to realize
that I have certain materialistic needs.

630
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,590
So….

631
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,619
Where are the questions?

632
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,724
I memorized them.

633
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,297
Sure.

634
01:02:16,073 --> 01:02:18,803
I gotta go to sleep.

635
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,601
Did you wanna borrow my pajamas?

636
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:25,009
No, thanks.

637
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:30,518
-Hey, he's a pretty smart kid.
-Yeah.

638
01:02:31,455 --> 01:02:34,288
He'll grow five inches in the next year.

639
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:43,327
-Mitch?
-Jordan?

640
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:49,635
Mitch Taylor?

641
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,169
Who....

642
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:57,312
My name is Sherry Nugil.
I've waited three years for this.

643
01:02:57,548 --> 01:03:00,642
-For what?
-For you to be old enough.

644
01:03:00,885 --> 01:03:04,548
-For what?
-For this.

645
01:03:17,301 --> 01:03:18,893
Come in!

646
01:03:21,505 --> 01:03:25,066
Hi, Mitch!
I'm just sanding my floor!

647
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:29,171
Could you turn that off a second?!

648
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,648
How come you're so sweaty?

649
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:39,151
I came back from helping Chris,
and a woman was in my room.

650
01:03:41,992 --> 01:03:46,019
-Pardon?
-A woman. You know, she was an adult.

651
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:51,197
Well, she wanted to....

652
01:03:51,435 --> 01:03:53,903
-How can I say this?
-Jump you?

653
01:03:55,172 --> 01:03:57,072
-Yeah.
-You made it?

654
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,675
-No. That's what was unbelievable.
-Pardon?

655
01:04:03,414 --> 01:04:06,577
I stopped her. I told her I didn't want to.

656
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:08,785
Why?

657
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,387
Because I really did want to.

658
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,521
I wanted to, but not with her.

659
01:04:22,299 --> 01:04:23,698
Oh.

660
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,544
-This is my class hour!
-It's May 10th.

661
01:04:42,787 --> 01:04:47,781
-What are you doing here?
-Me?! What are you doing here?

662
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:51,221
Decker is dangerous!
Where's the laser?

663
01:04:51,462 --> 01:04:54,124
-Coming.
-It's not even breathing hard.

664
01:04:54,398 --> 01:04:57,060
He wants it by the end of the week!

665
01:04:57,234 --> 01:05:00,226
Now you listen to me! You groveling bug!

666
01:05:00,504 --> 01:05:04,634
I have exams! I'm doing what I can, so get off my back!

667
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:11,104
That should just about do the trick,
as long as you stay cool.

668
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:14,751
-Let's go, girls.
-What does that mean?

669
01:05:14,919 --> 01:05:19,253
It's a figure of speech.
You guys coming to the exam?

670
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:24,189
I guess so, since Hathaway's gone to the trouble of having one.

671
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,692
You coming, buddy boy?

672
01:05:27,264 --> 01:05:30,165
I'll catch up. I gotta go to the bathroom.

673
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:34,996
I don't think that's gonna help your confidence any, do you?

674
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,135
Buddy boy.

675
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,713
Let's see how funny you think this is.

676
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,187
Buddy boy.

677
01:06:05,803 --> 01:06:07,794
All right, we--

678
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:15,344
We have exactly three hours.

679
01:06:15,546 --> 01:06:18,913
And remember, we believe in the honor system.

680
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:25,152
It'll be apparent how many of you haven't absorbed this material.

681
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:28,187
Take one and pass it back, like your IQ was normal.

682
01:06:28,492 --> 01:06:30,392
Good luck, buddy boy.

683
01:06:30,594 --> 01:06:36,658
Can I name my first child after you?
''Dipshit Knight'' has a nice ring.

684
01:08:10,694 --> 01:08:12,093
No. No!

685
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:14,662
No!

686
01:08:28,812 --> 01:08:31,838
My condolences on your meltdown.

687
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:35,042
What meltdown, Kent?

688
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:41,387
I'm not saying that you had one,
…because how would I know?

689
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,820
But just in case you do.

690
01:08:44,228 --> 01:08:47,061
-You slime.
-It's your own fault. You brought it on yourself.

691
01:08:47,464 --> 01:08:52,561
Didn't anyone ever tell you
to make sure your optics are clean?

692
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:35,438
I can do it!
How does it feel to be frozen?!

693
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,011
Ice is nice!

694
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:41,707
-Lazlo, buddy! Seen Mitch?
-No.

695
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:44,211
He's not in there.

696
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:48,050
-How'd you do?
-I passed! But I failed!

697
01:09:48,258 --> 01:09:51,625
Well, then I'm happy and sad for you.

698
01:09:51,862 --> 01:09:54,262
Gotta find Mitch. -- Mitch!

699
01:09:54,465 --> 01:09:56,456
He's not in the toilet.

700
01:09:56,734 --> 01:10:00,864
I'll freeze it and get at least an order of magnitude.

701
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:05,098
Because it's gonna be frozen.
I think I can do it.

702
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:06,637
Bye!

703
01:10:06,877 --> 01:10:09,402
Hey, man!
You're not Mitch.

704
01:10:09,613 --> 01:10:14,482
Hey, Lazlo!
Wanna see a demonstration of gravity?

705
01:10:14,718 --> 01:10:19,621
It can be done! That's a window! That's a door!

706
01:10:22,493 --> 01:10:25,087
Mitch! Where's your math!?

707
01:10:26,497 --> 01:10:27,964
Hey, you jerk!

708
01:10:28,165 --> 01:10:31,293
I'm very sorry! I'll buy you a car!

709
01:10:31,568 --> 01:10:34,332
I don't have one. It's my dad's.

710
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:54,924
How's it going, Jerry?

711
01:10:55,192 --> 01:10:56,591
What do you want?

712
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,988
World peace, but this isn't the time.

713
01:11:00,197 --> 01:11:03,360
-Get out!
-This might interest you.

714
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,262
-I'm not interested.
-Dr. Hathaway....

715
01:11:06,503 --> 01:11:08,994
Susan.

716
01:11:15,712 --> 01:11:18,340
I solved the power problem, Jerry.

717
01:11:20,884 --> 01:11:23,876
-Jerry?
-Take a cab.

718
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:27,953
So you'll hammer later.

719
01:11:33,697 --> 01:11:36,860
We were working on the cyanide system.

720
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:41,070
Well, earlier today, it ate itself.

721
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:45,865
But that's just what we needed
to take a giant step forward.

722
01:11:46,143 --> 01:11:47,667
Right, Kent?

723
01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:52,037
Needless to say, I was despondent about the meltdown.

724
01:11:52,216 --> 01:11:55,879
But in the midst of my preparations for hari-kari...

725
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:58,051
...it came to me.

726
01:11:58,255 --> 01:12:02,555
It's possible to synthesize excited bromide in an argon matrix.

727
01:12:02,759 --> 01:12:07,822
-Excimers, frozen in an excited state.
-That's impossible.

728
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:11,489
It's a chemical laser, but solid, not gaseous.

729
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:16,605
Put simply, in deference to Kent,
it's like lasing a stick of dynamite.

730
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:22,369
We couple it to a state that is
radiatively coupled to the ground.

731
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,749
Extracting 10-to-the-21st
photons per cubic centimeter...

732
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:33,786
...will give 1 kilojoule per cubic
centimeter, or a megajoule per liter.

733
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:35,288
That’s hotter than the sun.

734
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,754
-It's small.
-It's meant to be.

735
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:40,555
We only have the one sample...

736
01:12:40,864 --> 01:12:45,267
...and it's going to destroy itself as it lases.

737
01:12:48,038 --> 01:12:50,370
But everything will be fine.

738
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:52,740
-Right, Mitch?
-Yeah.

739
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:55,444
This is a complete waste of time.

740
01:12:55,646 --> 01:12:59,582
Kent, put the target in front of the cinder blocks.

741
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:10,749
Okay, come behind the shield.

742
01:13:19,403 --> 01:13:23,840
Okay, Mr. Taylor. Any time you're ready.

743
01:13:26,143 --> 01:13:30,341
Ready? Laser on!

744
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:38,678
All right!

745
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:43,015
Look at this!

746
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:49,325
Wow!

747
01:13:52,002 --> 01:13:56,496
-Sorry about the window.
-And the trees across the quad!

748
01:14:00,344 --> 01:14:01,777
You did it.

749
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,344
I did my part too.

750
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,348
You graduate. You get the job.

751
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:10,719
What? You can't! That's my job.

752
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,549
I've done everything you've ever asked me to.

753
01:14:16,393 --> 01:14:19,123
I teach your classes for you!

754
01:14:19,296 --> 01:14:22,493
-I get your laundry!
-What is he doing?

755
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:28,495
I mounted the optics for the target-tracking system.

756
01:14:29,573 --> 01:14:31,871
Look!

757
01:14:34,144 --> 01:14:36,806
Wait. Wait.

758
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:40,073
-Let's celebrate!
-Absolutely.

759
01:14:42,052 --> 01:14:45,579
You see anything unusual on the campus?

760
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,086
-My glasses!
-Well, try not to wobble.

761
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:56,428
-There is a complete hole.
-That's great.

762
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,224
Look.

763
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,038
Let's get a burger.

764
01:15:13,283 --> 01:15:15,615
-Let's go!
-In there?

765
01:15:23,927 --> 01:15:25,622
This place is wild.

766
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:31,595
-Do you see that?
-Like her? She's from Playa del Rey.

767
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:34,600
-Am I gonna meet your parents?
-No.

768
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:39,604
-Why? Are you ashamed of me?
-No, them.

769
01:15:40,043 --> 01:15:43,240
Remember the right people to thank on this.

770
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,812
-I'd like to thank my fish.
-What?!

771
01:15:46,049 --> 01:15:48,984
-And Mr. Ikagami!
-I love it.

772
01:15:54,224 --> 01:15:55,748
What are you saying?

773
01:15:56,259 --> 01:15:57,726
Lazlo!

774
01:16:07,671 --> 01:16:10,765
I'm glad you came out. Want a hamburger?

775
01:16:11,007 --> 01:16:14,602
I've been thinking about your laser solution.

776
01:16:14,845 --> 01:16:20,613
-You've increased it to 6 megawatts.
-Yeah, about that.

777
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:24,611
-What would you use it for?
-Enormous Swiss cheese?

778
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:27,089
It can do anything.

779
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:31,590
No. The beam would last for what,15 seconds?

780
01:16:31,995 --> 01:16:36,591
-What good is that?
-I respect you, but l graduated.

781
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,031
Let the engineers figure that out.

782
01:16:40,303 --> 01:16:42,635
Maybe someone already has a use...

783
01:16:42,873 --> 01:16:45,501
...for which it's been specifically designed.

784
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,107
Hathaway had something in mind?

785
01:16:48,278 --> 01:16:52,044
Look at the facts: very high power, portable...

786
01:16:52,282 --> 01:16:56,116
...limited firing time, unlimited range.

787
01:16:56,353 --> 01:16:59,288
With a tracking system and a mirror...

788
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:02,287
...you could vaporize a human target from space.

789
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,227
This is not good.

790
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:16,304
No!

791
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,699
What happened?

792
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:24,176
Oh, no.

793
01:17:25,582 --> 01:17:27,812
-Chris.
-I'm all right.

794
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:37,551
-They took everything.
-Kent's tracking system is gone!

795
01:17:39,095 --> 01:17:41,893
How could you build that mirror?!

796
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:52,905
He lied to us.

797
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:56,570
It's easy to lie to you, Mitch.

798
01:17:57,414 --> 01:17:58,676
You trust people.

799
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:01,781
I'm a cynic.

800
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,620
I'm such an asshole.

801
01:18:06,856 --> 01:18:09,950
I understand how you feel.
You're right.

802
01:18:10,193 --> 01:18:13,594
But we need to find out what he's doing.

803
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:15,387
Kent.

804
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,199
Shh, you guys!

805
01:18:44,294 --> 01:18:47,229
-We'll have two minutes.
-Pardon?

806
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,503
-Hi.
-Hi.

807
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,191
Okay, open his mouth.

808
01:19:18,862 --> 01:19:20,955
Bulldogs.

809
01:19:22,332 --> 01:19:24,425
And transceiver.

810
01:19:24,668 --> 01:19:26,761
And tweezers.

811
01:19:28,838 --> 01:19:31,500
The braces gave me the idea.

812
01:19:31,775 --> 01:19:34,835
Perfect antennae.
His head becomes a speaker.

813
01:19:35,045 --> 01:19:38,503
It's about time someone put it to good use.

814
01:19:45,221 --> 01:19:47,189
Kent?

815
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:51,718
Kent.
Wake up, Kent.

816
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:56,329
-Kent.
-What?

817
01:19:56,633 --> 01:19:59,966
I'm talking to you, Kent.

818
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:04,304
-What is this?
-I said, I'm talking to you.

819
01:20:04,507 --> 01:20:07,135
-No.
-Yeah.

820
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:11,138
Well, I'm not asleep.

821
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:16,076
-I must be overworked.
-You're not overworked, Kent.

822
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:18,719
Well, I'm not insane!

823
01:20:20,824 --> 01:20:23,588
-Or am I?
-That remains to be seen, Kent.

824
01:20:23,893 --> 01:20:27,329
But we are having a conversation.

825
01:20:30,934 --> 01:20:34,563
-Okay, who is this?
-This is Jesus, Kent.

826
01:20:34,771 --> 01:20:39,105
And you've been a very naughty boy!

827
01:20:40,510 --> 01:20:43,741
All right, who is this?

828
01:20:43,947 --> 01:20:47,212
-Cut the crap. You built a weapon.
-What?

829
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:53,013
What do you think a secret phase
conjugate tracking system is for?

830
01:20:53,289 --> 01:20:56,281
A big mirror makes a big beam.

831
01:21:00,363 --> 01:21:02,388
I guess it could be.

832
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:05,395
Where's the laser now?

833
01:21:05,702 --> 01:21:11,971
I overheard Jerry mention something about a test on the 27th.

834
01:21:12,308 --> 01:21:15,209
But I don't know where. It's classified.

835
01:21:18,148 --> 01:21:21,584
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

836
01:21:21,785 --> 01:21:26,154
l want you to think about what you've done, Kent.

837
01:21:26,389 --> 01:21:27,617
And from now on...

838
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:31,784
...stop playing with yourself!

839
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,630
It is God.

840
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,231
Now what?

841
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:43,962
Phase two.

842
01:21:46,476 --> 01:21:49,104
What is it with you?

843
01:23:30,747 --> 01:23:32,078
What's that?

844
01:23:32,682 --> 01:23:37,381
-These military are so untrusting.
-Can we get clearance?

845
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:42,353
-We will. It'll just take six hours.
-Forget it. We'll balls it.

846
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:44,288
How do these look?

847
01:23:45,428 --> 01:23:48,556
Mine looks like him, and his looks like me.

848
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:50,698
Great, I hope.

849
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,733
-What if they don't work?
-They shoot us.

850
01:23:59,442 --> 01:24:00,807
I.D.?

851
01:24:04,614 --> 01:24:08,710
-Show these to the next guard.
-You bet.

852
01:24:19,762 --> 01:24:21,093
I.D.s?

853
01:24:21,464 --> 01:24:26,163
Can you snap it up?
We're late, we're tired, we're hungry.

854
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:30,797
-Are you crazy?
-You gotta intimidate these guys.

855
01:24:32,175 --> 01:24:33,938
You're not on the list.

856
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:37,235
Yeah, that's because we're classified.

857
01:24:40,783 --> 01:24:42,512
Security.

858
01:24:43,853 --> 01:24:46,321
Aren't you young for technicians?

859
01:24:46,522 --> 01:24:48,752
Lasers are a young science.

860
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:52,416
There, I said it. Now we're both in trouble.

861
01:24:52,662 --> 01:24:56,996
-I'll call the duty officer.
-Hey there, Airborne.

862
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:07,641
Make that call, and it's our jobs.
We're four hours late.

863
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:12,338
Give us a break. Someday you'll
be in the private sector.

864
01:25:12,548 --> 01:25:14,709
Yeah.

865
01:25:19,188 --> 01:25:21,315
We're dead.

866
01:25:25,028 --> 01:25:27,223
-All right!
-I love it!

867
01:25:29,132 --> 01:25:33,000
Absolutely, sir; consider it done.

868
01:25:33,236 --> 01:25:35,136
Yes, sir.

869
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:41,033
Look for anything out of the ordinary.

870
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:45,814
Mitch, come here.

871
01:25:46,983 --> 01:25:48,382
My God.

872
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:53,588
Come on.

873
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,584
-Communication link?
-Open.

874
01:26:24,787 --> 01:26:28,348
Diagnostics seem okay.
Final check ready.

875
01:26:28,591 --> 01:26:31,583
Sixty-five degrees, nineteen minutes.

876
01:26:38,134 --> 01:26:41,934
All systems go.
We're finished here, fellas.

877
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:49,473
What!?

878
01:27:19,008 --> 01:27:24,139
This little polynomial will keep the computer busy.

879
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:29,016
Where are they?

880
01:27:32,755 --> 01:27:35,747
We've got a connection!
They're in!

881
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:46,665
-Abbott to Costello.
-Go ahead.

882
01:27:46,936 --> 01:27:50,804
-We've got the goodies.
-We've got target coordinates.

883
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:54,701
Roger, we're sending.

884
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,716
What is it?

885
01:28:06,122 --> 01:28:07,714
Oh, nothing.

886
01:28:10,793 --> 01:28:13,694
You didn't think we'd test in space?

887
01:28:13,963 --> 01:28:18,366
Yes, I did, because that's what it was designed for.

888
01:28:18,568 --> 01:28:22,470
But if you want to crawl before we walk...

889
01:28:22,705 --> 01:28:25,833
...that's fine too. Really.

890
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,204
-Attention!
-What?

891
01:28:28,411 --> 01:28:31,505
-Superior officer in the room!
-As you were.

892
01:28:31,814 --> 01:28:35,250
We're ready for the final on-board laser check.

893
01:28:47,897 --> 01:28:49,330
All clear.

894
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:52,729
I'm replacing the PROM with our EPROM.

895
01:28:58,107 --> 01:28:59,870
Okay, shoot.

896
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:08,079
May I have the coordinates, please?

897
01:29:08,684 --> 01:29:13,781
34 degrees, 10 minutes. 15.21 seconds north.

898
01:29:14,857 --> 01:29:19,453
119 degrees, 7 minutes....

899
01:29:24,533 --> 01:29:26,262
Right this way.

900
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,104
I'm gonna check the stairs.

901
01:29:42,952 --> 01:29:44,476
Hathaway's coming!

902
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:48,622
Mitch has told me that Herr Professor is approaching.

903
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:51,223
-What now?
-Hathaway's coming.

904
01:29:51,727 --> 01:29:54,059
I don't work well under pressure.

905
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,434
Watch your head there.

906
01:30:05,174 --> 01:30:06,505
I hope that works.

907
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:10,735
Okay, Chris, I mean, Abbott.
Hello? Hello?

908
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,845
They're gone!

909
01:30:13,082 --> 01:30:15,607
-Okay. Fine.
-Fine.

910
01:30:17,353 --> 01:30:21,016
Dr. Goy can answer any questions you might have.

911
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:24,657
Is there any problem with reusing the weapon?

912
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:31,322
No, the fuel is frozen and contains a self-sufficient unit.

913
01:30:31,534 --> 01:30:34,970
The beauty of this system is....

914
01:30:35,671 --> 01:30:39,698
-Is everything all right here?
-Why shouldn't it be?

915
01:30:45,848 --> 01:30:49,011
I think that just about sums it up.

916
01:30:49,285 --> 01:30:51,651
Shall we take our exit?

917
01:30:59,195 --> 01:31:01,993
-Okay, they're gone.
-That was close.

918
01:31:02,732 --> 01:31:06,964
Nothing like borrowing a B-1, huh, general?

919
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:14,804
What is it?

920
01:31:15,878 --> 01:31:18,346
Nothing.

921
01:31:23,352 --> 01:31:28,187
Diagnosis of schizophrenia by objective personal analysis....

922
01:31:29,992 --> 01:31:31,983
Hi, Kent.

923
01:31:32,194 --> 01:31:36,153
Oh, I thought you'd gone.

924
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:40,096
Not yet. Have you been touching yourself?

925
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:43,930
Yes. I mean, no!

926
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:46,204
Good.
Listen, Kent….

927
01:31:47,076 --> 01:31:51,706
Dad, you know, God, wants to show you something.

928
01:31:52,014 --> 01:31:54,414
Why? I meant what?

929
01:31:54,617 --> 01:31:57,552
I've learned not to ask.

930
01:31:57,787 --> 01:32:01,553
He says to wait in front of Dr. Hathaway's house...

931
01:32:01,757 --> 01:32:08,026
...at 639 Ivy Crest Drive, at precisely 7:08 this morning.

932
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:10,428
Ivy Crest?

933
01:32:10,733 --> 01:32:16,035
Wait there and you shall receive a sign, but do not go inside.

934
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:18,468
Well, why not?

935
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:22,407
Hello?

936
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:25,270
Hello, Jesus?

937
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:31,644
He hung up.

938
01:32:47,503 --> 01:32:51,769
Crossbow One, radar contact, heading 0-2-5.

939
01:32:51,974 --> 01:32:55,410
Maintain flight level 6-5-0.

940
01:32:55,644 --> 01:33:00,638
Roger. Steer 0-2-5 out of five thousand
for flight level 6-5-0.

941
01:33:25,508 --> 01:33:27,476
They're here.

942
01:33:30,846 --> 01:33:36,876
Mr. Knight, why is it that I am not surprised to see you here?

943
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:43,388
I suppose you have an explanation
for this event that we're to witness.

944
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:48,358
First, let me compliment you on your fashion sense.

945
01:33:48,564 --> 01:33:50,998
Particularly your slippers.

946
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:56,228
Yes, well, Philomena likes them.

947
01:33:56,472 --> 01:33:58,064
Hey, guys!

948
01:33:59,575 --> 01:34:01,668
Good morning.

949
01:34:03,212 --> 01:34:06,545
Congressman Doogan. What brings you around?

950
01:34:06,815 --> 01:34:11,218
I was told there was a situation of international importance.

951
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:22,993
The weapon is controlled from
this module, as it would be in space.

952
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:26,429
This is an exact duplicate of the cockpit.

953
01:34:26,669 --> 01:34:28,933
The accuracy will be as exact.

954
01:34:29,171 --> 01:34:34,666
-We are nearing the target.
-Open the bomb bay doors.

955
01:34:43,452 --> 01:34:46,888
-Those are serious accusations.
-I know.

956
01:34:47,122 --> 01:34:50,785
If it's true, I'm going to need proof.

957
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:54,518
We can accommodate you in just one minute.

958
01:34:54,763 --> 01:34:56,856
Duck.

959
01:34:58,634 --> 01:35:00,693
Congressman?

960
01:35:42,645 --> 01:35:45,307
Now, listen to me, Jesus.

961
01:35:46,482 --> 01:35:51,476
This is Jerry's house, and we're very close.

962
01:35:51,687 --> 01:35:55,987
If you don't answer me, I'm just gonna have to go in.

963
01:35:58,794 --> 01:36:01,194
-So I'm going.
-No, Kent!

964
01:36:01,697 --> 01:36:04,757
-Get away!
-Kent!

965
01:36:10,606 --> 01:36:13,006
Target locked.
In ten.

966
01:36:14,777 --> 01:36:16,210
Nine.

967
01:36:17,179 --> 01:36:18,669
Eight.

968
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:26,847
-Kent!
-Come out, Kent!

969
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:43,237
Okay, God! Let me have it!

970
01:37:28,117 --> 01:37:30,745
Popcorn!

971
01:37:52,141 --> 01:37:54,371
I don't understand. Did it fire?

972
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:56,737
Yes, but there's a problem.

973
01:37:56,979 --> 01:38:00,608
-It's not shutting down.
-Well, shut it down!

974
01:38:00,816 --> 01:38:03,614
-What's the problem?
-Shut it down!

975
01:38:04,953 --> 01:38:06,215
Kent!

976
01:38:26,608 --> 01:38:28,576
Kent.

977
01:38:35,184 --> 01:38:38,176
-Kent, you okay?
-That was great!

978
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:54,465
Something is very wrong.

979
01:38:54,703 --> 01:38:56,830
Out!

980
01:38:57,873 --> 01:38:59,807
Unlock the bird's-eye.

981
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:01,773
Unlocked.

982
01:39:02,845 --> 01:39:07,111
I'm tracking where the shot went.
I want to know it worked.

983
01:39:15,858 --> 01:39:18,691
Oh, no.

984
01:39:19,795 --> 01:39:23,822
-My house.
-What have you done?

985
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:32,830
All right!

986
01:39:56,431 --> 01:39:57,533
It's Hollyfeld in a Winnebago!

987
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:59,398
It's Hollyfeld in a Winnebago!

988
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:06,401
Lazlo, buddy!

989
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:11,178
I think we used too much.

990
01:40:12,047 --> 01:40:15,414
-I'm sorry you missed it.
-I had to pack.

991
01:40:15,617 --> 01:40:18,108
-Why?
-Well, I'm getting married.

992
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,956
-To whom?
-What is all this stuff?

993
01:40:22,457 --> 01:40:26,553
Oh, yeah. I won, 31.8% of the prizes.

994
01:40:26,795 --> 01:40:29,889
I'll figure it out.
But not this summer.

995
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:34,263
Sherry?
Sherry Nugil?

996
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,941
Isn't it great?
This is number one.

997
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:46,372
I've been looking for him for ten years.

998
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:55,215
-What can I say? She loves me.
-Congratulations.

999
01:40:58,627 --> 01:41:01,562
-You'll have to come and visit us.
-What?

1000
01:41:01,797 --> 01:41:05,460
I have a little survival place in Wyoming.

1001
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:09,330
Yeah, it's getting kinda weird around here.

1002
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:12,665
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

1003
01:41:27,155 --> 01:41:30,818
-Is it getting too weird around here?
-Absolutely.

1004
01:41:30,993 --> 01:41:34,759
-I didn't notice.
-I like it.
