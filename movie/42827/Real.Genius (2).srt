总统或任何其他负责机构知道此事吗?
Does the president or any other responsible agency know about this?

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,422
这是机密，乔治。再说了，这是中情局的责任。
We're on a need-to-know basis, George. Besides, the CIA's responsible.

52
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:18,801

I think they do need to know. You're gonna cause a major escalation.

00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:23,473
我们的研究表明，这种武器在战争中完全无用。
Our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless in warfare.

54
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,975
它不适合用在你的战争中。
It's not intended for use in your kind of warfare.

55
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:29,020
这是和平时期最完美的武器。这就是为什么它是秘密。
It's the perfect peacetime weapon. That's why it's secret.

56
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,023
-所以这既不道德又不道德?——是的。
- So it's both immoral and unethical? - Yes.

57
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,776
我们什么时候能拿到?
When do we get it?

58
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:44,994
据我所知，能源似乎有一个小的技术问题——我不想听到任何问题。我们计划今年夏天卖掉你的枪。
As I understand it, there seems to be a small technical problem with the energy source-- I don't want to hear about any problems. We have plans for your gun this summer.

59
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,330
我需要在这里取得成功。
I need a success here.

60
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:50,333
我不希望任何延误影响到我们的成功。
I don't need any delays jeopardizing that success.

61
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,711
-我说的够清楚了吗，唐?——哦。清晰的伏特加。
- Am I making myself clear, Don? - Oh. Clear as vodka.

你叫那个海瑟薇医生给我坐下。
You tell that Dr. Hathaway to get on the stick.

63
00:04:56,923 --> 00:05:01,636
-那我得更用力了。-只要我们六月前有武器就行。
- I'm gonna have to push harder, then. - As long as we have a weapon by June.

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,138
——对,将军?-我不知道，戴夫。
- Right, general? - I wouldn't know, Dave.

65
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,724
自从朝鲜战争后我就没有能用的武器了。
I haven't had a working weapon since Korea.

66
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:10,645
我很抱歉,大卫。这太过分了。
I'm sorry, Dave. This is too much.

67

-我要申请调任-很遗憾听到这个消息，乔治。
- I'm gonna ask for reassignment. - Sorry to hear that, George.

68
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,573
我强烈要求你停止。

69
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,868
谢谢你的建议。很遗憾你不能加入球队。
Thanks for your input. Sorry you won't be on the team.

70
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:27,537
也许下次。

71
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,582
太糟糕了。以前是个好人。
Too bad. Used to be a good man.

72
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,877
恐怕我们得解放乔治了。
I'm afraid we're gonna have to liberate George.

73
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,052
解放?你的意思是,清算?
Liberate? You mean, liquidate?

74
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,764
拉里，我们去看那部关于致盲技术的电影。
Larry, let's see that film on blinding techniques.

75
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,641
然后我们一起吃午饭。
Then we'll all have some lunch.

76
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:10,747
-你能签这个吗?-你是海瑟薇博士吗?
- Could you sign this, please? - Are you Dr. Hathaway?

77
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,540
是的,我是。
Yes, I am.

78
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,668
我很喜欢你的电视节目。
I just loved your television show.

79
00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:18,212
非常感谢。你真是太好了。
Thank you very much. That's very kind of you.

80
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:23,968
听。告诉我，爱因斯坦先生到底是什么样的人?
Listen. Tell me, uh, what is Mr. Einstein really like?

81
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,178
死了。
Dead.

82
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:30,850
你看，爸爸，激光是指通过刺激辐射来放大光。
See, Dad, laser means light amplification by stimulated emissions of radiation.

83
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,810
这是相干光。
So this is coherent light.

84
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:36,355
——哦。它会说话，对吧?——没有。
- Oh. So it talks, right? - No.

85
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:40,109
-海瑟薇博士，真是个惊喜!-你好吗，泰勒夫人?
- Dr. Hathaway, what a surprise! - How are you, Mrs. Taylor?

86
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:41,778
米奇的考试成绩有问题吗?
Something wrong with Mitch's test scores?

87
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:45,323
如果有，那是因为我感冒了不能给他做早餐。
If there is, it's because I had the flu and couldn't make him breakfast.

88
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,493
我想我应该飞过来亲自告诉你这个消息。
Well, I thought I'd fly in and bring you the news myself.

89
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:53,289
我刚从招生处得到消息。我们做到了。米奇在太平洋理工大学。
I just got word from Admissions. We did it. Mitch is in at Pacific Tech.

90
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,291
-这不是很好吗?-干得好，小子!
- Isn't that wonderful? - Way to go, boy!

91
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,168
别摇他的头!
Don't shake his head!

92
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,045
-你好吗，米奇?——好。
- How you doing, Mitch? - Fine.

93
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,589
-这里陈列得不错。——谢谢。
- Nice display here. - Thanks.

94
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,760
这是一种342纳米的闪光灯泵浦紫外线激光。
It's a flash-lamp-pumped ultraviolet laser at 342 nanometers.

95
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,556
如你所知，人们对核聚变用的原子碘激光很感兴趣。
Well, as you know, there is interest in the atomic iodine laser for fusion.

96
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,183
这是分子碘。
This is molecular iodine.

97
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,270
因此，这种激光不受原子碘的复合影响。
Therefore, this laser doesn't suffer from recombination of the atomic iodine.

98
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:18,397
你一定很自豪。
You must be very proud.

99
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,982
——骄傲?-哦,是的。确定。
- Proud? - Oh, yeah. Sure.

100
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,945
米奇是我们冬至学期接收的第一个学生。
Mitch is the first student we've ever accepted for midwinter term.

101
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,739
——亲爱的。-我想他也是最小的。
- Honey. - I imagine he's the youngest too.

102
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,367
不。事实上，我们最小的孩子才12岁。
No. Actually, the youngest we ever had was 12.

103
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,744
他在压力下不到六个月就崩溃了。
He cracked under the pressure within six months.

104
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,539
米奇是15。这不会有任何问题的。
Mitch is 15. There's not gonna be any problem with that.

105
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:37,375
正确的。听着，博士，关于奖学金的事。
Right. Listen, doc, about this scholarship thing.

106
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,211
你会给他签约奖金，对吧?
Now, you're gonna give him a signing bonus, right?

107
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:49,095
不。但是通过让米奇加速进步，我们给了他机会去实现他的潜能。
No. But by allowing Mitch to progress at an accelerated rate, we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his potential.

108
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,972
我们只是想给米琪最好的。
We just want the best for Mitchie.

109
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:54,892
海瑟薇博士，我那天晚上看了你关于放射性同位素的节目。
Dr. Hathaway, I saw your show the other night on radioactive isotopes.

110
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:57,603
-我有个问题要问你。——是吗?
- And I've got a question for you. - Yes?

111
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,398
-那是你的真头发吗?-是的。
- Is that your real hair? - Yeah.

112
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,818
-告诉我，米奇是领养的吗?——为什么,不!
- Tell me, is Mitch by any chance adopted? - Why, no!

113
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,903
——这是惊人的。——不是吗?
- It's amazing. - Isn't it?

114
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,406
如果我不吃点东西，我会死的。
If I don't get something to eat, I'm gonna die.

115
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,324
-再见，海瑟薇医生。——再见。
- Bye, Dr. Hathaway. - Goodbye.

116
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,787
回头见，亲爱的。
I'll see you later, honey.

117
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:17,290
他们真的很好。
They're really all right.

118
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,334
只是有时候他们不知道我在说什么。
It's just sometimes they don't know what I'm talking about.

119
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:24,255
我很确定。告诉我，米奇，你会想念你的朋友吗?
I'm sure about that. So tell me, Mitch, are you gonna miss your friends?

120
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:28,968
-不，我觉得我吓到其他孩子了。——好男孩。
- No, I think I intimidate other kids. - Good boy.

121
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,263
米奇，有件事你得明白。
Mitch, there's something you're going to have to understand.

122
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,183
和你相比，大多数人的智商和胡萝卜差不多。
Compared to you, most people have the IQ of a carrot.

123
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:43,065
我们和大多数人不一样，米奇。更好。我-你在这啊，海瑟薇医生!-嗨。好的，稍等，稍等。
We're different than most people, Mitch. Better. I'm-- - There you are, Dr. Hathaway! - Hi. Yes, one second, one second.

124
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,737
我把你安排进了我自己的研究小组里面有全校最优秀的人才。
I've put you on my own research team with the finest minds on the campus.

125
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,907
这是我第二次把这样的荣誉授予新生。
This is the second time I've ever given such an honor to a freshman.

126
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,326
第一个是1981年的克里斯·奈特，对吧?
The first one was Chris Knight in 1981, right?

127
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,704
-你听说过克里斯吗?-是的，他是物理学的传奇人物。
- You've heard of Chris? - Yes, he's a physics legend.

128
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,831
你将和克里斯一起工作。
You're going to be working with Chris.

129
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:02,418
他现在大四了，他和以前一样聪明。
He's a senior now, and he's as brilliant as he ever was.

130
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,628
哇。
Wow.

131
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,674
你一毕业，这份工作就等着你了，克里斯。
Soon as you graduate, this job will be waiting, Chris.

132
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,884
太好了。
Great.

133
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,679
我们在这里有一个完整的实体工厂。-你有按摩浴缸?
- We have a complete physical plant here. - You have a Jacuzzi?

134
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,306
——当然。——好。
- Absolutely. - Good.

135
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,767
实验室和办公室就在这边。
And the labs and offices are right over this way.

136
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,101
请跟我来。
Follow me, please.

137
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,613
伙计们!
Guys!

138
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:36,244
-来见见克里斯·奈特。我是雪莉·努吉尔。-很高兴见到你。
- Meet Chris Knight. This is Sherry Nugil. - Pleased to meet you.

139
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,121
-这位是迈克·多德。——多德博士?
- And this is Mike Dodd. - Dr. Dodd?

140
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,916
他刚刚设计了我们全新的电信卫星。
The one who just designed our brand-new Telcom satellite.

141
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,584
很荣幸见到您，先生。
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

142
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:45,253
电信产品。
Telcom.

143
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,715
那颗卫星不就是把碎片撒遍欧洲的卫星吗?
Isn't that the satellite that's raining debris all over Europe?

144
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,592
为什么那个玩具在你头上?
Why is that toy on your head?

145
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,928
因为如果我把它穿到别的地方，它就会摩擦。
Because if I wear it anywhere else, it chafes.

146
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:58,307
我很抱歉。我只是不想让你们觉得我很古板。
I'm sorry. It's just that I didn't want you guys to think I was stuffy.

147
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,769
你知道，没有乐趣。只有大脑，没有阴茎。
You know, no fun. All brain, no penis.

148
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,314
——原谅我?——我很抱歉。
- Pardon me? - I'm sorry.

149
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:07,817
这只是对权威的幼稚反应。
It's just an infantile response to authority.

150
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,111
是的。你是克里斯·奈特，对吗?
Yes. You are Chris Knight, aren't you?

151
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,988
我希望如此。我穿着他的内裤。
I hope so. I'm wearing his underwear.

152
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,992
这是一个笑话!我得到它!那是有趣的!
It's a joke! I get it! That's funny!

153
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,619
我就是忍不住。你们真有趣。
I just can't help it. You guys are such fun.

154
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,247
好吧，我们努力做到。对吗，迈克?
Well, we try to be. Isn't that right, Mike?

155
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,040
不。
No.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,419
克里斯，雪莉会带你四处看看。
Chris, Sherry's gonna show you around the place.

157
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:30,256
你可以问她任何关于福利待遇、着装要求等问题。
You can ask her any questions about benefits, dress codes, whatever.

158
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,426
-待会在我办公室见好吧?——太棒了。
- I'll see you in my office later. Okay? - Great.

159
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,512
雪莉，好好照顾这个年轻人。
Sherry, take very good care of this young man.

160
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,848
他是全国十个最聪明的人之一!
He's one of the ten finest minds in the country!

161
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,391
我希望有一天我也能成为他们中的两个人。
Someday I hope to be two of them.

162
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,272
-你很漂亮。——谢谢。
- You are very beautiful. - Thank you.

163
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,024
我怎么样了?太闷了?
How'd I come off? Too stuffy?

164
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:51,193
你的行为举止显然不像美国十大头脑之一。
You certainly don't act like one of the top ten minds of America.

165
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:54,030
——真的吗?你见过几个?- 7。
- Really? How many have you met? - Seven.

166
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,615
——真的吗?——嗯。你会八。
- Really? - Mmm. You'll be eight.

167
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,703
麻省理工学院的霍斯特勒教授排名第六。
Professor Hostetler at MIT was number six.

168
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,206
老教授Hostetler吗?他不是死了吗?
Old Professor Hostetler? Isn't he dead?

169
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,917
他是现在。
He is now.

170
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,677
你好。我在找总统的新生茶?
Hello. I'm looking for the President's Freshman Tea?

171
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,387
哦,很好。
Oh, good.

172
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:21,015
我很高兴我们有一个。
I'm so glad we have one, then.

173
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,683
吉恩，太过分了。
Gene, it's too much.

174
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,769
-不，我不这么认为。——基因。
- No, I don't think so. - Gene.

175
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:29,106
-我是米奇·泰勒。——哦。海瑟薇教授的明星。
- This is Mitch Taylor. - Oh. Professor Hathaway's bright star.

176
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,318
-是的，先生-而且你已经在做他的项目了
- Yes, sir. - And you're already on his project.

177
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,863
-我们对你寄予厚望。-希望如此，先生。
- We expect great things from you. - Oh, I hope so, sir.

178
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,825
-哦，给点建议。-哦，谢谢
- Oh, a bit of advice. - Oh, uh, thank you.

179
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:46,165
总是……不。永远不要忘记检查你的推荐信。
Always... No. Never forget to check your references.

180
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,669
好的。谢谢你！
Okay. Thank you.

181
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,757
-我得走了哦。对不起。-没关系。
- Uh, I better be going. Oops. Sorry. - That's all right.

182
00:11:56,008 --> 00:12:00,596
我觉得年轻人很喜欢我在口头上“趴下”，你说呢?
I think the young people enjoy it when I "get down" verbally, don't you?

183
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,391
嘿，葬礼在哪里举行?
Hey, where's the funeral?

184
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,728
万一你没注意到呢
♪ In case you hadn't noticed ♪

185
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:13,567
♬这是狗吃狗吃狗吃狗
♪ It's the dog eating dog Eating dog eating dog ♪

186
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,277
万一你没注意到呢
♪ In case you hadn't noticed ♪

187
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,695
你好吗，老兄?
How you doing, sport?

188
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,323
♬这是猫和老鼠……♪
♪ It's the cat and the mouse... ♪

189
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,243
嘿，鲍比，等一下，伙计!
Hey, Bobby, wait up, man!

190
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,165
看看他是不是在楼下房间里。他可能在里面。
Check if he's down in his room. He might be in there.

191
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,434
我们去骑自行车吧。
Let's go for a bike ride.

192
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,771
恰克，你哥哥打电话来了。
Chuck, your brother called.

193
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:54,733
-他从来不在家，伙计-不，我不知道他在哪
- He's never home, man. - No, I don't know where he is.

194
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:06,454
喂?
Hello?

195
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,924
-这是什么地方?-嗨。
- What kind of a place is this? - Hi.

196
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,635
如果重力逆转，你会做好准备吗?
Would you be prepared if gravity reversed itself?

197
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,224
我唯一不明白的是如何把零钱留在口袋里。
The only thing I can't figure out is how to keep the change in my pockets.

198
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,810
我懂了。裸体。
I've got it. Nudity.

199
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:36,066
我今早来过-你没收拾好，对吧?——没有。
I was here this morning-- - You didn't straighten up, did you? - No.

200
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,527
很好。我所有的脏东西都是按字母顺序排列的。
Good. All my filth is in alphabetical order.

201
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,530
例如，这个在“H”代表“玩具”下面。
This, for example, was under "H" for toy.

202
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:44,325
-那是什么?——这?这是阴茎担架。
- What is that? - This? It's a penis stretcher.

203
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,827
-你想试试吗?——不!
- You wanna try it? - No!

204
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:56,504
我在开玩笑。这是他一系列转移注意力的举动中的另一个，目的是试图逃避责任。——我…放下我的行李。现在我所有的包都空了。
I'm kidding. It's yet another in a long series of diversions - in an attempt to avoid responsibility. - I, uh... Dropped off my luggage. And now all my bags are empty.

205
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,798
你看，米奇，我以前是你。
You see, Mitch, I used to be you.

206
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:09,099
最近我很想我自己，所以我问海瑟薇能不能让我再和我一起住。
And, uh, lately I've been missing me, so I asked Hathaway if I could room with me again.

207
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,311
我把你的东西都放在最下面的抽屉里了。
So I put all your stuff away in the bottom drawer there.

208
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,523
运动夹克有问题，所以我把它扔了。鸭子!
Had trouble with the sports jacket, so I threw it out. Duck!

209
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,235
不错的反应。我是克里斯的骑士。
Nice reflexes. I'm Chris Knight.

210
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,030
-哦,不。-哦,是的。鸭子了!
- Oh, no. - Oh, yes. Duck again!

211
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:27,076
嘿!
Hey!

212
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,786
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my God!

213
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,829
它朝油箱去了。鸭子!
It's heading for the gas tanks. Duck!

214
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,087
你认为这是一个发射问题还是一个设计问题?
Would you classify that as a launch problem or a design problem?

215
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,717
-我们落后太多了杰里-我们又不是在做奶酪三明治
- We're falling way behind, Jer. - We're not making cheese sandwiches.

216
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:46,428
——好的。下来!——嘿!
- All right. Get down! - Hey!

217
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,682
你在做什么?你疯了吗?你差点害死我们!
What are you doing? Are you crazy? You could have killed us!

218
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,351
那是院长之一，我不能和你在一起。
That is one of the deans, I cannot be seen with you.

219
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:56,105
我知道，杰里，但既然我在开车，你不觉得你应该躲起来吗?
I know, Jer, but since I'm driving, don't you think you should be hiding?

220
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,898
他看见我。
He saw me.

221
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,027
杰瑞，听着，我是来告诉你气候变了。
Jerry, look, I came here to tell you that the climate has changed.

222
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,572
我们需要在4个月内，而不是18个月内，找到一个可行的模型。
We need a working model within four months, not 18.

223
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,199
你不能支配创新，唐。
You can't dictate innovation, Don.

224
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,827
让我换一种说法。
Let me put it another way.

225
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,663
你知道我们在研发上花了多少钱吗?
You know all the money we've been spending on development?

226
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,914
是的。
Yes.

227
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:18,502
当一个项目被终止时，财务部门的人总会进行审计。
Well, when a project gets cut off, the finance boys always run an audit.

228
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,379
——我明白了。
- I see. - Mm.

229
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,968
小杰，你的老房子要装修一下了吧?
Having a little work done on the old place, huh, Jer?

230
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,970
欺诈是重罪。
Fraud is a felony.

231
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,147
你在看什么?你们是劳动者，你们应该劳动。
What are you looking at? You're laborers, you should be laboring.

232
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,232
这就是没受过教育的后果。
That's what you get for not having an education.

233
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,070
滚出去!继续，继续!滚出去!滚出去!
Get out of here! Go on, go on! Get out of here! Get out!

234
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,324
去长!
Go long!

235
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,366
——有!——是的!
- Got it! - Yeah!

236
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,215
——嘿!——是吗?
- Hey! - Yes?

237
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,760
-放下三明治走吧。——我吗?
- Put down the sandwiches and go. - Me?

238
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,638
不,尤达。是的,你!只是一点。
No, Yoda. Yeah, you! Just a bit.

239
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,723
-我没有-脑子?
- I don't have any-- - Brains?

240
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,434
——没有。三明治。-那你还有什么用?
- No. Sandwiches. - Then what good are you?

241
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:19,229
-我们应该吃什么?-你到底是不是那家餐厅的?
- What are we supposed to eat? - Are you from the restaurant or not?

242
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,899
不。我是米奇•泰勒。我是一名学生。
No. I'm Mitch Taylor. I'm a student.

243
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,193
海瑟薇医生让我上来。
Dr. Hathaway told me to come up here.

244
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,278
哦。
Oh.

245
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,532
你是新来的种马，是吗?
So, uh, you're the new stud, are you?

246
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,203
-什么意思?——螺柱。能人。大脑。
- How do you mean? - Stud. Hotshot. Brain.

247
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:38,290
-你才12岁，对吧?我15岁。你在等他吗，还是——?
- You're 12 years old, right? - I'm 15. Are you expecting him, or--?

248
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,918
是的。现在任何一分钟。您要点什么吗?
Yeah. Any minute now. Can I get you something?

249
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,046
——一个气球吗?-我应该看一下你的作品。
- A balloon? - I'm supposed to take a look at your work.

250
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,214
检查一下。
Check it over.

251
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,926
-检查一下?——好吧,是的。
- Check it over? - Well, yes.

252
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,261
——为了什么?-我想是错误吧。
- For what? - Mistakes, I guess.

253
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,348
-他说你们被困住了-不不不。
- He said you guys were stuck. - No, no, no.

254
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,059
让我们把事情弄清楚。
Let's get something very clear here.

255
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,896
杰瑞不在的时候，按我说的做。
Okay, when Jerry's not here, you do what I say.

256
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,358
从上帝到杰瑞再到我。明白了吗?
It goes from God to Jerry to me. Get it?

257
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:09,530
你好,杰瑞。
Hello, Jerry.

258
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,491
我告诉过你，肯特。你不能叫我的名字。
I told you before, Kent. You don't get to use my first name.

259
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,869
——我是吗?-你好吗，米奇?
- Did I? - How you doing, Mitch?

260
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,330
现在，我相信你们都会成为很快的朋友。
Now, I'm sure you'll all become fast friends.

261
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,416
-我们已经在路上了——好。
- We're well on our way already. - Good.

262
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:24,044
米奇被介绍完之后，我希望你能从他身上得到暗示。
After Mitch is brought up to date, I want you to take your cues from him.

263
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:28,006
他关于高效荧光化合物的想法是我见过的最新颖的。
His ideas on efficient fluorescent compounds are the most original I've seen.

264
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,843
所以从现在开始，米奇负责这个小组。
So from now on, Mitch is gonna be in charge of the group.

265
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,094
真的,杰瑞?
Really, Jerry?

266
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,930
-你又来了，肯特-是吗?
- You're doing it again, Kent. - Oh, am I?

267
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,392
-奈特在哪里?-他今天懒得来上班。
- Where is Knight? - He didn't bother to come in today.

268
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,147
嗯…——什么事 Bodie?-他说他不喜欢。
Uh... - Yes, Bodie? - He said he didn't feel like it.

269
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,399
我说:“最好是这样。”他说:“不然呢?”
I said, "You better." And he said, "Or what?"

270
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,193
我说"不然你就有麻烦了"他说:“堵住它!”
I said, "Or else you're gonna be in trouble." He said, "Jam it!"

271
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,280
这是一个精彩的故事。我注意到你不再口吃了。
That's a wonderful story. I noticed you stopped stuttering.

272
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,199
-一直在给自己做电击治疗。-提高电压。
- Been giving myself shock treatments. - Up the voltage.

273
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:58,036
-真遗憾他不在-那个小丑看看这个!
- I'm sorry he isn't here-- - That clown? Look at this!

274
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,706
我们听说他不来了。肯特决定不等他就开始。
We heard he wasn't coming. Kent decided to start without him.

275
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,043
荧光产量微不足道。我们认为样品被损坏了。
The fluorescent yield's insignificant. We think the sample's been damaged.

276
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,881
——什么?-显然是疏忽造成的。
- What? - Well, obviously the result of negligence.

277
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:13,635
准备另一份样品至少需要一周时间，我很担心。
It'll take us at least a week to prepare another sample, and I was afraid of this.

278
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,472
-你确定吗?——我们确定，非常确定
- Are you sure about that? - We're sure. Positive.

279
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,725
——对不起。打扰一下。-没有任何借口
- Excuse me. Excuse me. - There's simply no excuse for it.

280
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,270
-是啊，米奇，怎么了?-我想激光泵坏了。
- Yeah, Mitch, what is it? - I think the pump laser is down.

281
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,147
这看起来不对。看。
This doesn't look right. Look.

282
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,737
在那里。
There.

283
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:37,993
-嗯，现在好像好多了。——啊,史……该死，别碰别人的东西!
- Well, it seems to be all better now. - Aw, shi... Damn it, don't touch other people's things!

284
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,955
-肯特，我需要你——什么,杰里。
- Kent, I need you. - Anything, Jerry.

285
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,627
什么?你想让我帮你上二年级的课吗?
What? Do you want me to teach your sophomore class for you?

286
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,923
不，我需要你做一些复制，把目前所有的数据都复印一份。
No, I need you to do some duplicating, get copies made of all the data so far.

287
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,468
这样小米奇就可以开始了。他明天会检查所有东西。
So young Mitch can get started. He's gonna check everything tomorrow.

288
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,263
——我的荣幸。-然后去我的洗衣店。
- My pleasure. - Then after that, stop by my cleaners.

289
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,516
别想了。我喜欢它。
Don't give it a thought. I enjoy it.

290
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,519
-米奇，我们走吧?在这一时刻。——确定。
- Mitch, shall we? On the moment. - Sure.

291
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:16,073
我想这是上帝给杰瑞的，给你的，给洗衣店的。
Well, I guess it goes from God to Jerry, to you, to the cleaners.

292
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,242
肯特?
Right, Kent?

293
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:25,916
图书馆、图书馆……Two-oh-five。
Library, library... Two-oh-five.

294
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:40,264
欢迎来到太平洋科技的“冰上聪明人”节目。
Welcome to Pacific Tech's "Smart People on Ice."

295
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,853
让我们去滑冰。
Let's go skating.

296
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:51,525
-哎呀，冰做得太好了!-是啊，成功了，不是吗?
- Ick, the ice turned out so great! - Yeah, it worked, didn't it?

297
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,529
-你是怎么做到的?——哦,当然。
- How did you do it? - Oh, sure.

298
00:19:55,612 --> 00:20:00,576
我告诉你，然后你告诉别人，接下来，我们就进入了另一个冰河世纪。
I tell you, then you tell somebody else, next thing you know, we're in the middle of another ice age.

299
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:06,456
-每个人都在滑冰!-就因为你偷懒，骑士!
- Everybody must be skating! - Just 'cause you're a slack, Knight!

300
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,250
-鼹鼠和巨魔。——什么?
- Moles and trolls. - What?

301
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,588
摩尔和巨魔。工作,工作,工作。我们永远见不到天日。
Moles and trolls. Work, work, work. We never see the light of day.

302
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,674
我们计划了好几个星期，他们只想学习。
We plan this thing for weeks and all they wanna do is study.

303
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:20,012
我厌恶。抱歉，但这不是我的风格。我沮丧。
I'm disgusted. I'm sorry, but it's not like me. I'm depressed.

304
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:27,477
我们没有人参加变异仓鼠比赛，只有一个人参加了居里夫人长相比赛，后来他被取消了资格。
We had no one at the mutant hamster races, one entry for the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was disqualified later.

305
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,897
我为什么要费心呢?
Why do I bother?

306
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,568
我们走吧!你们是什么，一群怪人吗?
Let's go! What are you, a bunch of weirdos?

307
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,280
-要樱桃吗?我自己种的。——樱桃?
- Want a cherry? I grow them myself. - A cherry?

308
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,158
好吧,推一次。
Okay, push once.

309
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,583
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

310
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,546
不,不是感情。不,我不是。我很失望。并不是很可怕。但仍然。
No, not emotionally. No, I'm not. I'm disappointed. Not terribly. But still.

311
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,215
它应该走得更远，更快。
It should have gone much further, much faster.

312
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,886
我知道问题出在哪里。显然是阻力系数。
I know what the problem is. It's obviously the drag coefficient.

313
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,473
我得重新设计一下刀片。我可以做到，没问题。
I'll just have to redesign the blades. I can do that, no problem.

314
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:08,101
但我必须把它们切掉，这需要工具和时间。
But I've got to cut them, and that takes tools and time.

315
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,521
-你知道这会持续多久吗?-再过半个小时吧。
- Do you know how long this will last? - Maybe another half an hour.

316
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,774
太好了。我可以做到，没问题。
That's great. I can do that, no problem.

317
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,776
——好的。你叫什么名字?——米奇。
- Okay. What's your name? - Mitch.

318
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,986
谢谢你的帮助，米奇。回头见。
Thank you for your help, Mitch. I'll see you later.

319
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,280
欢迎你!
You're welcome!

320
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:27,162
-那是谁?-我是乔丹我听说有新人了。你是吗?
- Who was that? - That-- I'm Jordan. I heard there was gonna be someone new. Are you it?

321
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,538
是的。
Yeah.

322
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,082
-你有床吗?-是的。
- Do you have a bed? - Yeah.

323
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:34,002
我想给你做一个，但你有一个。好吧，回头见。好吧,再见。
I'd make you one, but you have one. Okay, I'll see you later. Okay, bye.

324
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:35,963
再见。
Bye.

325
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:43,095
-这是怎么回事?——这?这是冰。
- What's all this supposed to be? - This? This is ice.

326
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,639
这就是水太冷时的情况。
This is what happens to water when it gets too cold.

327
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,307
这个吗?这是肯特。
This? This is Kent.

328
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,268
当人们在性方面太受挫时，就会发生这种事。
This is what happens to people when they get too sexually frustrated.

329
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,481
这应该能让你忙一阵子了。
This should keep you busy for a while.

330
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:58,527
加上你的常规课程负荷，一个月后你的大脑就会对木薯粉产生兴趣。
This plus your regular class load should turn your brains to tapioca in a month.

331
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,031
肯特，这太不公平了。我们要让你成为冬季嘉年华之王。
Kent, that is so unfair. And we were gonna make you king of the winter carnival.

332
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,074
是吗?
Yeah?

333
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,660
哦,哈哈哈。
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

334
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,037
我猜你也有份。你成功了吗?
I suppose you're in on this too. Did you make it?

335
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,665
-我没说。-那谁来清理呢?
- I'm not saying. - Well, who's gonna clean it up?

336
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:15,168
你不必这么做。它会直接从固态变成气态。
You don't have to. It's gonna go from solid form directly to gas.

337
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,838
哇。真的吗?它是什么?
Whoa. Really? What is it?

338
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,508
我不是说。但我可以告诉你，它相当罕见，非常不稳定。
I'm not saying. But I can tell you that it's fairly rare and very unstable.

339
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,592
就像你。
Just like you.

340
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,846
-你们是一群堕落的人。——我们是谁?
- You're a bunch of degenerates. - We are?

341
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,973
我发现你光着身子拿着那碗果冻。
I found you naked with that bowl of Jell-O.

342
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,683
-你没有。-这是真的。
- You did not. - This is true.

343
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,937
我又热又饿。好吗?
I was hot, and I was hungry. Okay?

344
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,690
不管怎样，我要告诉你，奈特。
And anyway, I got news for you, Knight.

345
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,776
-你已经不是这里的第一了。-第一什么?
- You're not number one here anymore. - Number one what?

346
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,280
这位强力鼠比你的排名高出20分。
Mighty Mouse over here beat your placement scores by over 20 points.

347
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:46,116
是的,你呢?你以为你很厉害吗?
Yeah, you did? You think you're hot stuff, huh?

348
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,325
不。
No.

349
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,620
是啊，也许你比我聪明。
Yeah, well, hey, maybe you are smarter than me.

350
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,080
但你能做到吗?
But can you do this?

351
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:57,544
哇!
Whoa!

352
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,758
伊克，冰块怎么了?
Ick, what's happening with the ice?

353
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,092
打开一扇窗!
Open a window!

354
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,431
呃——我融化!
Ick, I'm melting!

355
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,850
——它成功了!——这就是整洁!
- It worked! - That's neat!

356
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,729
-如果我们能阻止它爆炸的话。——爆炸?哦,上帝。
- Now if we can keep it from exploding. - Exploding? Oh, God.

357
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:21,943
嘿,我吐!你说爆炸是开玩笑吧?
Hey, Ick. You're just joking about exploding, right?

358
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,404
恶心吗?
Ick?

359
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,823
这是个玩笑，对吧?
It's a joke, right?

360
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,267
早上好。我看见你进来了。
Good morning. I saw you come in here.

361
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,562
我们昨晚见过，记得吗?我带着雪橇。我是乔丹。
We met last night, remember? I had the sled with me. I'm Jordan.

362
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,398
——在这里。我给你做了件毛衣。——昨晚?
- Here. I made you a sweater. - Last night?

363
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,693
这是我用手做的事。我希望我的尺寸是对的。
It's something I do with my hands. I hope I got the size right.

364
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,320
我有一个哥哥，我用他来比较身材。
I have a brother and I use him for size comparison.

365
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:51,158
我的眼力很好，所以我给你做了一个，因为我还没睡。
I have a pretty good eye, so I went ahead and made you one 'cause I was up.

366
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,451
-你在尿尿吗?-是的。
- Are you peeing? - Yeah.

367
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,205
哦。我从不睡觉。我不知道为什么。我把我的室友逼疯了。
Oh. I never sleep. I don't know why. I drove my roommate nuts.

368
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,042
他们只好用救护车把她送走。她现在没事了，但她得转院。
They had to take her away in ambulance. She's okay now, but she had to transfer.

369
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,878
我不知道这是不是我的错。
I don't know if that's my fault.

370
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,381
如果你想找人谈谈，告诉我。我就住在隔壁。
If you ever need to talk, let me know. I'm just a couple doors down.

371
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,341
我从不睡觉，好吗?
And I never sleep, okay?

372
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,635
——谢谢。我会的。-你说完了吗?
- Thanks. I will. - Are you done?

373
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,805
-呃，我没法开始。-因为我在这里?
- Uh, I can't start. - Because I'm here?

374
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,223
我想是的。
I think so.

375
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,935
——奇怪。我得走了。——我也是。
- Weird. Well, I have to go. - Me too.

376
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,271
再见。
Bye.

377
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,821
早上好!
Good morning!

378
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,502
——克里斯?——早上。
- Chris? - Morning.

379
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:48,131
你知道吗，今天早上我身上发生了奇怪的事。
You know, um, something strange happened to me this morning.

380
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:56,806
你是在做梦吗，梦见自己穿着长袍站在金字塔上，身边有1000个裸体女人尖叫着朝你扔咸菜?
Was it a dream where you see yourself standing in a robe on a pyramid with 1000 naked women screaming and throwing little pickles at you?

381
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,350
不。
No.

382
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,436
为什么只有我一个人有这个梦想?
Why am I the only person that has that dream?

383
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,318
那是液氮吗?
Is that liquid nitrogen?

384
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,237
嗯嗯。
Mm-hm.

385
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,572
——咖啡吗?——没有。
- Coffee? - No.

386
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,829
所以,发生了什么事?
So, what happened?

387
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:21,957
你知道有个人住在我们的衣橱里吗?
Did you know there's a guy living in our closet?

388
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,042
你也见过他?
You've seen him too?

389
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,336
他是谁?
Who is he?

390
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:31,758
Hollyfeld。
Hollyfeld.

391
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,594
-他为什么进我们的衣橱?-你为什么要进去?
- Why does he go in to our closet? - Why do you go in?

392
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,514
去拿我的衣服。但这不是他进去的原因。
To get my clothes. But that's not why he goes in there.

393
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:41,017
当然不是。他是你的两倍大。你的衣服根本不适合他。
Of course not. He's twice your size. Your clothes would never fit him.

394
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,894
是的。
Yeah.

395
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,856
问这些问题之前先想想，米奇。
Think before you ask these questions, Mitch.

396
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,610
比我高20分，觉得那样的大个子能穿他的衣服。
Twenty points higher than me, thinks a big guy like that can wear his clothes.

433
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,323
-你找我?——奈特。
- You wanted to see me? - Mr. Knight.

434
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:13,451
准时。这在现在有点不寻常。
Right on time. That's a little unusual these days.

435
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,662
-你还跑步吗?-只有在被追逐的时候。
- You still run? - Only when chased.

436
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,749
-那是什么味道?-一定是那只狗。
- What's that smell? - Must be the dog.

437
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,668
——这是爆米花。-是的，先生，我知道
- That's popcorn. - Yes, sir. I know.

438
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,087
把它拿开。我受不了爆米花。我讨厌爆米花。
Get it away from me. I can't stand popcorn. I hate popcorn.

439
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,255
来吧，把它放在那边。
Come on, put it over there.

440
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,257
很好。现在我知道送你什么生日礼物了。
Good. Now I know what to get you for your birthday.

441
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:33,137
我想我们的地位上升了，是吧，杰瑞?
I guess we're moving up in the world, eh, Jerry?

442
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,016
-它很优雅。——谢谢。尽量不要碰任何东西。
- It's very elegant. - Thank you. Try not to touch anything.

443
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,144
-可以吗，先生?-这是橡木的，又不是胶合板。
- Is this okay, sir? - It's oak, not plywood for God's sake.

444
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,981
-和以前的地方相比变化很大。——鞋子。
- Quite a change from the old place. - Shoes.

445
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:47,527
听着，我想在实验室里多见到你。
Look, I want to start seeing a lot more of you in the lab.

446
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,320
好吧。我要增加体重。
Fine. I'll gain weight.

447
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,907
-你真是个有趣的孩子，克里斯。-谢谢，杰瑞，我们尽力了。
- You're a very funny boy, Chris. - Thanks, Jerry, we try.

448
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:56,703
你可以坐。
You can sit.

449
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:02,250
当我第一次带你来这所学校时，我以为你会成为另一个爱因斯坦。
When I first brought you into this school, I thought you'd become another Einstein.

450
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,837
-你在你的路上。然后呢?-我去理发了。
- You were well on your way. And then? - I got a haircut.

451
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,840
-你让我失望了，克里斯。-你也是我，杰瑞。
- You're disappointing me, Chris. - And you me, Jerry.

452
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:16,431
-是关于我们的交易-我知道，杰瑞。和…我推动你的项目比学校里任何三个学生都要多。
- Look, it's about our deal. - I know, Jerry. And... I have advanced your project more than any three students on campus.

453
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:19,726
那是昨天吃的。你今天为我做了什么?
That was yesterday. What have you done for me today?

454
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,894
嗯…
Well...

455
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,607
5月中旬我要5兆瓦。
I want five megawatts by mid-May.

456
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:33,781
杰瑞，我觉得你可能对这一切有点着迷了。
Uh, Jerry, I think you might be getting a little obsessive about all this.

457
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,325
我收留了米奇，好吗?
Now, I took in Mitch, okay?

458
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,871
他进展得很好。他在为你竭尽全力。
He's coming along fine. He's working his guts out for you.

459
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,666
-那你到底想要什么?- 5月中旬我要5兆瓦。
- So, what exactly do you want? - I want five megawatts by mid-May.

460
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,878
听着，我不在乎你是否傲慢。
Look, I don't care if you're arrogant.

461
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,589
我不在乎你是否无礼。
I don't care if you're disrespectful.

462
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,425
但你的态度让米奇分心了。而我不会这样做。
But your attitude's distracting Mitch. And that I won't have.

463
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,304
规则已经改变了。我想在五月中旬之前拿到。
The rules have changed. I want it by mid-May.

464
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:01,517
杰瑞，我觉得你忘了一个小细节。
Jerry, I think that you're just forgetting about one little detail.

465
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:05,813
那我就走了。我走了，我已成历史。我是鬼马小精灵。
And that's I'm out of here. I'm gone, I'm history. I'm Casper.

466
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,482
我毕业。
I'm graduating.

467
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,027
要想毕业，你需要上我的课，亲爱的孩子。
To graduate, you need my course, dear boy.

468
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,739
看来我对你做什么，去哪里有发言权了。
So it seems that I have a say about what you do and where you go.

469
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:18,826
所以从现在开始，你和米奇醒着的时候都要待在实验室里。
So from now on, you and Mitch will spend every waking moment in the lab.

470
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,996
你要在我的期限前解决我的电力问题。
And you will solve my power problem and solve it by my deadline.

471
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:32,173
杰里……如果你以为威胁我就能让我做你的奴隶……这一点你是对的。
Jerry... If you think that by threatening me you can get me to be your slave... that's where you're right.

472
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:35,218
但是我这么说只是因为我在乎。
But-- And I'm only saying this because I care.

473
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:40,056
——有很多不含咖啡因的品牌和真正的咖啡一样美味。
--there are a lot of decaffeinated brands that are just as tasty as the real thing.

474
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,683
我没开玩笑，克里斯。
I'm not kidding, Chris.

475
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:46,854
我也不是，杰瑞。
Neither am I, Jerry.

476
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:58,908
嗨,米奇。
Hey, Mitch.

477
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,702
帮我个忙，好吗?
Do me a favor, will you?

478
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:04,080
这味道。拜托，你不会伤害我的感情的。
Taste this. Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.

479
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,249
尝一下就行了，好了。
Just give it a taste-- Yeah, there you go.

480
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,416
什么,太甜?
What, too sweet?

481
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:11,587
-什么事?-我不知道，在实验室里
- What is it? - I don't know, it was in the lab.

482
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:13,256
哦!
Oh!

483
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,968
别紧张，只是酸奶而已。嗯。
Relax, it's just yogurt. Mmm.

484
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:22,139
-米奇，米奇，你没事吧?-不，我没有。
- Mitch, Mitch, are you all right? - No, I'm not.

485
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:25,184
这种电和化学氰化物的结合是愚蠢的。
This combination of electrical plus chemical cyanide is dumb.

486
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,436
我们走错方向了。
We're going in the wrong direction.

487
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,106
你是唯一知道怎么用这垃圾的人。
You're the only one that knows how to use this garbage.

488
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:33,276
你不会在这里。最后，我觉得我的大脑被炸了。
You're never here. And, finally, I think I'm getting brain-fried.

489
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,319
好吧，米奇，我会补偿你的。
Okay, Mitch, I'm gonna make it up to you.

490
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:36,779
我们暂停一下，把它放下。
Let's just pause, put that down.

491
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,866
让我们先退一步。
Let's just take a step back.

492
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:43,786
不，我错了，对不起，往前走一步。
No, I was wrong, sorry, take a step forward.

493
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,621
现在退一步。
Now take a step back.

494
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,917
和进步。然后退后一步。然后我们跳恰恰舞。
And step forward. Then step back. And then we're cha-cha-ing.

495
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:53,254
-你能别说了吗?我是认真的!-好吧，我也是认真的
- Will you stop it? I'm serious! - Okay, I'm serious too.

496
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,757
让我们给这个宝贝充电吧。把你知道的都给我。来吧。
Let's charge this baby up. Give me everything you got. Come on.

497
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:00,428
我得去笼子里连接电容器。
I gotta go in the cage to connect the capacitors.

498
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:02,221
好了，现在是工作时间。

00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,945
——怎么了?-我不喜欢这里了。
- What's wrong? - I don't like it here anymore.

627
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,947
我想回家和你住在一起。
I wanna come home and live with you.

628
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:26,285
你把我的房间租出去了?妈妈,谁?
You rented out my room?! Mom, to who?

629
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,620
你还记得埃切瓦里亚先生吗，他是水管工。
You remember Mr. Echevarria, he's the plumber.

630
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:31,290
——倾听。-妈妈
- Listen. - Mom--

631
00:46:42,134 --> 00:46:44,136
你昨晚在哪里?
So where were you last night?

632
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,555
实验室，你应该在的地方。
The lab, where you were supposed to be.

633
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:50,726
嗯。是的。
Mmm. Yeah.

634
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:54,354
乔丹说海瑟薇对你下手了。他到底做了什么?
Jordan said that Hathaway got down on you. What exactly did he, uh--?

635
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:00,068
让我先考虑一下，然后再打给你。
Let me hold on to that thought and get back to you.

636
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:09,119
——妈妈。-妈妈，你在听吗?
- Mom. - Mom, are you there?

637
00:47:09,203 --> 00:47:11,330
宝贝，你听起来很沮丧。怎么了?
Baby, you sound upset. What's wrong?

638
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:14,875
-我不喜欢这里了。-我想回家和你一起住。
- I don't like it here anymore. - I wanna come home and live with you.

639
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,128
不是让你喜欢，而是让你去做。
It's not for you to like, it's for you to do.

640
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,630
你现在15岁了。
You're 15 years old now.

641
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:22,216
我想回家和你住在一起。
I wanna come home and live with you.

642
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:25,761
-你想和我还有爸爸一起住吗?-是的。和爸爸。
- You want to live with me and Daddy? - Yeah. And Dad too.

643
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:31,141
-我想回到高中。-爸爸把你的房间租出去了
- I wanna go back to high school. - Daddy's rented out your room.

644
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:32,309
我的房间吗?
My room?

645
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:35,562
-妈，给谁?!-埃切瓦里亚先生，他是水管工
- Mom, to who?! - Mr. Echevarria, he's the plumber.

646
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:40,150
-埃切瓦里亚先生和我一起住。-妈，我不想再呆在这里了。
- Mr. Echevarria and I can share it. - Mom, I don't wanna stay here anymore.

647
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:43,737
米琪，这听起来可不像妈妈的小兵。
Now, Mitchie, that doesn't sound like Mama's little soldier.

648
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,531
米奇，是你爸爸。
Mitch, it's your dad.

649
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,618
——嗨,爸爸。-你在哭吗?
- Hi, Dad. - Are you crying?

650
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:54,164
-是的，先生，很抱歉-我希望没人看见你。
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry. - Well, I hope nobody sees you.

651
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:57,501
-我只是个孩子。-你从来不只是个孩子。
- I'm just a kid. - You've never been just a kid.

652
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:17,688
好的。
Okay.

653
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:24,403
如果你想走，就走吧。
If you wanna leave, go ahead.

654
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:29,199
但是，你会错过乐趣的。
But, uh, you're gonna miss the fun.

655
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:31,618
什么乐趣?
What fun?

656
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:34,871
伊克发明了一种新病毒我们要在肯特的房间里释放它
Ick invented a new virus and we're going to release it in Kent's room.

657
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:38,000
那天晚上我需要你的帮助而你只想去派对。
The other night I needed your help and you just wanted to party.

658
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,419
我确实帮过你。我试着帮你放松。
I did help you. I tried to help you relax.

659
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:44,006
被美容师冷落不是我的放松方式。
Being snubbed by beauticians is not my idea of relaxing.

660
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,424
学生美容师。
Student beauticians.

661
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:51,638
我以为这地方不一样。但这是一样的。
You know, I thought this place was different. But it's just the same.

662
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:55,350
高中时，他们把我塞进邮箱。我告诉过你吗?
In high school, they stuffed me in a mailbox. Did I tell you that?

663
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:58,353
我的老师不喜欢我，因为我比他们聪明。
My teachers disliked me because I was smarter than they were.

664
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:02,316
学生们讨厌我，因为我搞砸了钟形曲线。听起来是不是很熟悉?
Students hated me because I blew the bell curve. Does that sound familiar?

665
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:04,192
米奇，我和你一样。
Mitch, I was just like you.

666
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:10,866
我妈妈过去常给我穿上白衬衫和油炸小甜甜圈，保证不会有女孩和我说话。
My mother used to dress me in white shirts and Hush Puppies, guaranteeing that a girl would never talk to me.

667
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:14,911
当我第一次来这里的时候，有三年时间我一直在学习。
When I first came here, for three years I studied all the time.

668
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:16,955
——你呢?-是的。
- You? - Yeah.

669
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:22,669
然后有一天晚上，当我坐在这把椅子上时，我看到了一个幻象。
Then one night, when sitting in this chair right here, I had a vision.

670
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:24,546
——什么?——Hollyfeld。
- What? - Hollyfeld.

671
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:29,176
-壁橱里的那个人?——Lazlo Hollyfeld。
- The guy in the closet? - Lazlo Hollyfeld.

672
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,722
我跟着他进了壁橱，进了蒸汽通道。
And I followed him into the closet, down into the steam tunnels.

673
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:38,352
在那里我看到了我这辈子见过的最恶心的事。
And there I saw the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.

674
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:40,812
——什么?-穿着睡衣的霍利菲尔德
- What? - Hollyfeld in his pajamas.

675
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:45,067
——所以呢?-所以我跟他谈了
- So? - So I talked to him.

676
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,777
——你做了吗?-是的。
- You did? - Yeah.

677
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,238
他在70年代是这里的头号种马。
He used to be the number one stud around here in the '70s.

678
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:53,033
比你我加起来还聪明。
Smarter than you and me put together.

679
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:55,702
-发生什么事了?他破解了吗?——是的。
- So, what happened? Did he crack? - Yes.

680
00:49:55,786 --> 00:49:57,204
他严重开裂。
He cracked, severely.

681
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:01,333
——为什么?-他热爱他的工作。
- Why? - He loved his work.

682
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:05,337
-那有什么不对吗?——什么都没有。但这就是他所做的一切。
- Well, what's wrong with that? - Nothing. But that's all he did.

683
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,049
他喜欢解决问题，喜欢想出答案。
He loved solving problems, he loved coming up with the answers.

684
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:13,303
但他认为答案就是一切的答案。
But he thought that the answers were the answers for everything.

685
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:17,182
只有科学，没有哲学。
All science, no philosophy.

686
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:21,269
有一天，有人告诉他他做的东西正在杀人。
One day, someone tells him that the stuff he was making was killing people.

687
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:27,109
那么，你想说什么?我会死在蒸汽隧道里吗?
So, what's your point? I'm gonna end up in a steam tunnel?

688
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:29,653
-是的。——什么?
- Yeah. - What?

689
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:32,739
如果你再这样下去，你就是。
You are, if you keep up like this.

690
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:35,367
米奇，你不需要离开这里。
Mitch, you don't need to run away from here.

691
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,411
当你聪明的时候，人们需要你。
When you're smart, people need you.

692
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:42,040
-你可以创造性地运用你的思维。-是的。
- You can use your mind creatively. - Yeah.

693
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,877
-我注意到你学习不太努力。宾果。
- I noticed you don't study too hard. - Bingo.

694
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:54,845
是啊，但如果我留下，我该怎么办?
Yeah, but if I stay, what should I do?

695
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:58,390
首先，报复肯特。这是一种道德义务。
First thing, get even with Kent. It's a moral imperative.

696
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,062
-是的。——是的!
- Yeah. - Yeah!

697
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,817
-现在你试试。——是的!
- Now you try it. - Yeah!

698
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:13,572
——这很好。现在让我们解压。——正确的。
- That's good. Now let's unpack. - Right.

699
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:38,388
所以达灵顿才这么可爱。你会得到一切。
Which is what makes Darlington so sweet. You get everything.

700
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:42,267
-是的，但奈特已经锁定了。-也许他有，也许他没有。
- Yeah, but Knight's got that locked. - Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.

701
00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:47,856
好吧!嘘!
Okay! Psst!

702
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,817
来吧。来吧，伙计们。他走了。
Come on. Come on, you guys. He's gone.

703
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,411
肯特把他的名字放在盘子上。
Kent put his name on his plate.

704
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:03,413
我妈对我的内裤也是这么处理的。
My mom does the same thing with my underwear.

705
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:05,874
你妈在你内裤里放车牌?你怎么坐?
Your mother puts license plates in your underwear? How do you sit?

706
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,391
嗨,肯特。
Hey, Kent.

707
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:26,895
这是你的车。
That's your car.

708
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,815
肯特，你知道你不应该把车停在校园里。
Kent, you know you're not supposed to park that on campus.

709
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,233
你知道，这一点都不好笑。
You know, this isn't funny.

710
00:52:33,026 --> 00:52:35,570
-你这次太过分了。-我有帮手。
- You've gone too far this time. - I had help.

711
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:38,782
你,嗯?
You, huh?

712
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:41,910
我会抓到你们的。
I'm gonna get you guys.

713
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:45,622
海瑟薇医生会知道的。你会后悔的!
Dr. Hathaway's gonna hear all about this. You'll rue the day!

714
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:49,125
- "后悔"?谁会这样说话?-我不知道。
- "Rue the day"? Who talks like that? - I don't know.

715
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:03,348
哇。你好。
Wow. Hello.

716
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,016
嗨。
Hi.

717
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,644
嗯…
Well...

718
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:16,945
听着，杰瑞让我过来。他让你做什么了?
Listen, Jerry asked me to drop by. What did he ask you to do?

719
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:20,031
——什么?-你听不懂哪个词?
- What? - Which word didn't you understand?

720
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:22,993
-你是来开会的吗?什么会议?
- Are you here for the meeting? - What meeting?

721
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:25,328
-我不知道。——好的。
- I don't know. - Okay.

722
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:29,249
-听着，我只是在等——太棒了。
- Look, I'm just waiting. - Great.

723
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:34,087
归根结底，如果你做不到，我们就得找别人。
What it comes down to, if you can't do it, we'll have to get somebody else.

724
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,967
-我有时间表，医生。-我们很亲密，一切都会好的。
- I have a timetable, doctor. - We're very close, everything'll be fine.

725
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,596
唐，记住，你为我工作。我想我已经明白我的意思了，不是吗?
Don, remember, you work for me. I think I've made my point, haven't I?

726
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:46,558
——晶莹剔透。真的。-有什么要告诉我的吗，孩子们?
- Crystal clear. Really. - Anything I should know about, boys?

727
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,853
-我马上就来。——再见,杰里。,祝你好运。
- I'll be with you in a moment. - Goodbye, Jerry. And good luck.

728
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:50,937
苏珊。
Susan.

729
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,607
我想我们该说再见了。
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

730
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:57,360
我很抱歉我根本没机会了解你。
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to know you at all.

731
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:03,366
我受不了了。你这辈子见过这样的尸体吗?
I can't stand it. Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?

732
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:07,203
-她正好是我女儿。——哦。好吧，那我猜你有。
- She happens to be my daughter. - Oh. Well, then I guess you have.

733
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:09,539
——来,唐?-是的。
- Coming, Don? - Yeah.

734
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:19,633
说真的，听着，如果有什么我能为你做的或者…更重要的是，你告诉我，好吗?
Seriously, listen, if there's ever anything I can do for you or... more the point, to you, you let me know, okay?

735
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:23,053
你能用鸡鸡在木板上钉钉子吗?
Can you hammer a spike through a board with your penis?

736
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:26,139
-现在不行。-女孩应该有自己的标准。
- Not right now. - A girl's gotta have her standards.

737
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:27,432
苏珊。
Susan.

738
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:33,897
-那是一个非常聪明的女孩。-你知道你在干什么吗?
- That is a very smart girl. - What do you think you're doing?

739
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,941
-你说过过来。-离地毯远点。
- You said, come over. - Stay off the rug.

740
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:39,611
脱掉你的鞋子。
Take off your shoes.

741
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,988
-怎么了，医生?——坐下来。
- What's up, doc? - Sit down.

742
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:46,242
-那些人是谁?-你对我已经没用了!
- Who were those guys? - You are no longer of any use to me!

743
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,620
用这种有趣的方式开始对话。
Interesting way to open up a conversation.

744
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:50,330
我要把达灵顿的工作给肯特。
I'm giving Kent the Darlington job.

745
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:52,916
你突然发现幽默了吗?你给了我这份工作。
Did you suddenly find humor? You gave me the job.

746
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,752
-你需要一个学位。-我能通过你的考试。
- You need a degree. - I can pass your exam.

747
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:57,712
就算过了，也不会过。
Even if you pass, you don't pass.

748
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:03,468
-你为什么不现在就走?——好,好。我去找梅雷迪思医生。
- Why don't you leave right now? - Okay, fine. I'll go to Dr. Meredith.

749
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:06,012
光我在激光方面所做的工作就应该获得学位。
The work I've done on laser alone should merit a degree.

750
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:09,975
你想跟他说什么都可以。他会相信谁，你还是我?
You can tell him anything you like. Who will he believe, you or me?

751
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:15,271
-你不能这么做——完成。你出去了。现在出去!
- You can't do this. - It's done. You're out. Now get out!

752
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:17,899
我保证你再也不会干这行了。
And I'll make sure you never work in this field again.

753
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,277
-你这个难以置信的混蛋-放心吧。
- You unbelievable bastard. - Count on it.

754
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:48,388
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

755
00:55:52,726 --> 00:55:57,689
自我实现。我想起苏格拉底的不朽名言，他说:
Self-realization. I was thinking of the immortal words of Socrates, who said:

756
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,442
“我喝了什么?”
"I drank what?"

757
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:03,278
有什么问题吗?
Is there something wrong?

758
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,408
海瑟薇要让我退学了。
Hathaway is going to flunk me out of school.

759
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,661
——为什么?-我搞砸了。
- Why? - I screwed up.

760
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:16,875
-你打算怎么办?-我想我该走了。
- What are you gonna do? - I guess I'll leave.

761
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:20,253
你不能这么做。你会失败的!
You can't do that. You'll be a failure!

762
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:22,422
谢谢你,米奇。
Thank you, Mitch.

763
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,722
你就是不能走。你欠我10块钱。
You just can't leave. You owe me 10 bucks.

764
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,438
你现在不能辞职。
You can't quit now.

765
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:44,486
如果没有别的原因，只是为了看一场5兆瓦的激光大火。只有一次。
If for no other reason than just to see a five-megawatt laser fire. Just once.

766
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,237
那太好了。
That would be nice.

767
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:52,202
-你得有始有终。-谁说的?
- You gotta finish what you start. - Who said that?

768
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:53,453
你知道的。
You know that.

769
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:59,375
没错,米奇。但这并不能激励别人。
That's right, Mitch. But that is no way to motivate somebody.

770
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,589
你得报复杰瑞·海瑟薇。
You've got to get even with Jerry Hathaway.

771
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:07,592
这是一种道德义务。
It's a moral imperative.

772
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:11,262
说得好。
That's a good point.

No. Vito, not again.

814
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,506
别放在邮箱里，维多。
Not in the mailbox, Vito.

815
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:34,966
——不!——米奇。
- No! - Mitch.

816
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:37,010
米奇。
Mitch.

817
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:43,891
你为什么不去睡一会儿呢?
Why don't you get some sleep.

818
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:49,188
我们又不是在开车什么的。我希望你还在成长。
It's not like we're driving or anything. You're still a growing boy, I hope.

819
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,361
嘿,Lazlo。
Hey, Lazlo.

820
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,741
Lazlo吗?
Lazlo?

821
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:02,702
哦。
Oh.

822
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:05,705
那就是我。你好。
That's me. Hello.

823
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,374
我一直在观察你。
I've been watching you.

824
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:12,462
谢谢。
Thanks.

825
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:23,681
我觉得你考试可能需要帮助，所以我找到了海瑟薇在每次期末考试中问过的所有问题。
Well, I thought you might need some help with the test, so I found every question Hathaway's ever asked on every final he's ever given.

826
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,726
天啊，我什么都没给你准备。
Gee, I didn't get you anything.

827
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:27,935
那些是他们吗?
Are those they?

828
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:31,564
不。
No.

829
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:35,318
这些都是菲多利的战利品。
These are entries into the Frito-Lay sweepstakes.

830
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:38,529
没有购买必要的。你想进来就进来，我也是。
No purchase necessary. Enter as often as you want, so I am.

831
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:41,657
太好了!多少次?
That's great! How many times?

832
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:46,037
这批是165万。
Well, this batch makes it 1,650,000.

833
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:50,458
我应该赢得32.6%的奖金，包括这辆车。
I should win 32.6% of the prizes, including the car.

834
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,127
这样就没什么意思了，不是吗?
That kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it?

835
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,923
但是他们制定了规则。
But they set up the rules.

836
01:01:57,006 --> 01:02:00,593
我开始意识到我有一定的物质需求。
And I've come to realize I have certain materialistic needs.

837
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:04,597
所以,嗯…问题在哪里?
So, uh... Where are the questions?

838
01:02:06,516 --> 01:02:07,725
我记住了他们。
I memorized them.

839
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:09,852
确定。
Sure.

840
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:17,443
嗯…我得去睡觉了。
Uh... I gotta go to sleep.

841
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,822
你想借我的睡衣吗?
Did you wanna borrow my pajamas?

842
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,783
不。不,谢谢。
No. No, thanks.

843
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:29,497
-嘿，他是个很聪明的孩子-是的。
- Hey, he's a pretty smart kid. - Yeah.

844
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:34,293
明年他就会长五英寸了。
He's gonna grow five inches in the next year.

845
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,218
——米奇?-乔丹?
- Mitch? - Jordan?

846
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,266
米奇·泰勒?
Mitch Taylor?

847
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,186
呃,谁……?
Uh, who...?

848
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:56,524
我叫雪莉·努吉尔。我等这一刻等了三年了。
My name is Sherry Nugil. I've been waiting three years for this.

849
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,902
——为了什么?-等你长大了。
- For what? - For you to be old enough.

850
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,989
——为了什么?- - - - - -。
- For what? - For this.

851
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:18,212
进来!
Come in!

852
01:03:21,424 --> 01:03:23,885
哦,嗨,米奇!我只是在打磨地板!
Oh, hi, Mitch! I'm just sanding my floor!

853
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,972
你能把那个关了吗!
Could you turn that off a second?!

854
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:34,645
有什么事吗?你怎么出这么多汗?
What's the matter? How come you're so sweaty?

855
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:39,150
我帮完克里斯回来，发现我房间里有个女人。
I came back from helping Chris, and there was a woman in my room.

856
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:46,032
——原谅?——一个女人。你知道，她是个成年人。
- Pardon? - A woman. You know, she was an adult.

857
01:03:46,115 --> 01:03:53,915
——哦。-她想…她想……-哦,上帝。我怎么能这么说呢?——你跳吗?
- Oh. - Well, she wanted... She wanted to... - Oh, God. How can I say this? - Jump you?

858
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,084
-是的。-你和她一起做的?
- Yeah. - You made it with her?

859
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:01,631
——没有。这是令人难以置信的。——原谅?
- No. That's what was unbelievable. - Pardon?

860
01:04:03,341 --> 01:04:06,594
这是真的。我阻止了她。我告诉她我不想去。
It's true. I stopped her. I told her I didn't want to.

861
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:07,678
为什么?
Why?

862
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,098
因为我真的很想。
'Cause I really did want to.

863
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:19,524
——嗯?-我想。但是…没有和她在一起。
- Huh? - I wanted to. But... not with her.

864
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,653
哦。
Oh.

865
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,547
-这是我的上课时间。-今天是5月10日，杰里。
- This is my class hour. - It is the 10th of May, Jer.

866
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,758
——什么,唐?你在这里做什么?-我在做什么?
- What, Don? What are you doing here? - What am I doing--?

867
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:47,802
你在这里做什么?!
What are you doing here?!

868
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,222
你不知道，德克尔很危险!激光在哪里? !
You don't realize, Decker is dangerous! Where's the laser?!

869
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:54,141
——它的到来。-它甚至都没有呼吸困难。
- It's coming. - It's not even breathing hard.

870
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:56,894
杰瑞，他这周末就要激光!
Jerry, he wants the laser by the end of the week!

871
01:04:56,978 --> 01:05:00,273
现在，你听我说!你匍匐的错误!
Now, you listen to me! You groveling bug!

872
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:04,652
我有考试!我已经尽力了，别再烦我了!
I have exams! I am doing what I can, so get off my back!

873
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:10,491
只要你保持冷静，那就差不多可以了。
Well, that should just about do the trick, as long as you stay cool.

874
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:14,704
-走吧，姑娘们。-你这是什么意思?
- Let's go, girls. - What do you mean by that?

875
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:19,250
这是一种比喻，鲍迪。你们到底来不来考试?
It's a figure of speech, Bodie. You guys coming to the exam or what?

876
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:24,213
我想是吧，因为海瑟薇为了生一个孩子费尽了心思。
I guess so, seeing as Hathaway's gone through all the trouble of having one.

877
01:05:24,297 --> 01:05:25,715
你来吗，伙计?
You coming, buddy boy?

878
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:30,177
我一会儿就来找你们。我得去趟洗手间。
Uh, I'll catch up to you guys. I have to go to the bathroom.

879
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:33,973
好的,肯特。我觉得这对你的自信一点帮助都没有，对吧?
Okay, Kent. I don't think that's gonna help your confidence any, do you?

880
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:41,439
朋友的男孩。
Buddy boy.

881
01:05:42,398 --> 01:05:43,608
朋友的男孩。
Buddy boy.

882
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:48,070
看看你觉得这有多好笑。
Let's see how funny you think this is.

883
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:55,453
朋友的男孩。
Buddy boy.

884
01:06:05,588 --> 01:06:07,465
好的,我们—
All right, we--

885
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,222
我们还有整整三个小时。
We have exactly three hours for this.

886
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:18,934
记住，同学们，我们这里信奉荣誉制度。
And remember, we believe in the honor system here, boys and girls.

887
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:25,232
不过很明显，你们中有多少人已经吸收了这些材料，有多少人没有。
Though it will be apparent to me how many of you have absorbed this material and how many of you haven't.

888
01:06:25,316 --> 01:06:28,235
拿一个，传回去，就像你的智商正常一样。
Take one, pass it back, just like your IQ was normal.

889
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,404
祝你好运，伙计。
Good luck, buddy boy.

890
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:33,074
你介意我给第一个孩子取你的名字吗?
Do you mind if I name my first child after you?

891
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:35,660
"笨蛋骑士"听起来不错。
"Dipshit Knight" has a nice ring to it.

892
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,307
哇!
Whoa!

893
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:10,504
什么?
What?

894
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:12,047
不。不!
No. No!

895
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:14,216
不!
No!

896
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:20,765
不,不!
No, no!

897
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:31,066
我对你的崩溃表示哀悼，奈特。
My condolences on your meltdown, Knight.

898
01:08:32,902 --> 01:08:34,153
肯特,什么危机?
What meltdown, Kent?

899
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:40,743
我不是说你有…因为我怎么知道?
I'm not saying that you had one... because how would I know?

900
01:08:41,494 --> 01:08:43,037
但以防万一。
But just in case you do.

901
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:47,082
——你的粘液。-这是你自己的错，奈特
- You slime. - It's your own fault, Knight.

902
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:50,461
没人告诉过你要确保你的光学设备是干净的吗?
Didn't anyone ever tell you to make sure your optics are clean?

903
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:35,089
我能做到!被冻住是什么感觉!
I can do it! How does it feel to be frozen?!

904
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,883
是啊!冰很好!
Yeah! Ice is nice!

905
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:41,095
——Lazlo,伙计!你看到米奇了吗?——嗯…不。
- Lazlo, buddy! Have you seen Mitch? - Uh... No.

906
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:43,430
——不是吗?米奇!——没有。他不在里面。
- No? Mitch! - No. He's not in there.

907
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:48,060
-你怎么样?——如何?我通过了!但是我失败了!是啊!
- How'd you do? - How? I passed! But I failed! Yeah!

908
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,771
-那我又为你高兴又为你难过。——谢谢。
- Well, then I'm happy and sad for you. - Thank you.

909
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,275
要找到米奇。米奇!
Gotta find Mitch. Mitch!

910
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:56,485
这是美丽的。他不在厕所里。
That's beautiful. He's not in the toilet.

911
01:09:56,569 --> 01:10:00,322
我要把它冷冻起来，至少得到一个数量级。
I'm gonna freeze it and get at least an order of magnitude.

912
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:03,075
因为它会被冻住。我想我能做到。
Because it's gonna be frozen. I think I can do it.

913
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:05,911
不确定。我得找到米奇。当心再见!
Not sure. I gotta find Mitch. Take care. Bye!

914
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:09,415
嘿,男人!你不是米奇。你也不是。
Hey, man! You're not Mitch. And you're not either.

915
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:12,710
嘿,Lazlo !想看重力的演示吗?是啊!
Hey, Lazlo! Wanna see a demonstration of gravity? Yeah!

916
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:14,503
-我一定要去!——克里斯!
- I gotta get there! - Chris!

917
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:17,506
这是可以做到的!这是一个窗口!那是一扇门!
It can be done! That's a window! That's a door!

918
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,508
这是一个大厅!
That's a hall!

919
01:10:21,677 --> 01:10:24,597
是啊!米奇!你的数学在哪里? !
Yeah! Mitch! Where's your math?!

920
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:27,975
嘿,你混蛋!
Hey, you jerk!

921
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:30,728
-我很抱歉。-我给你买辆车。
- I'm very sorry. - I'll buy you a car.

922
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:33,314
我没有。这是我爸爸的。
I don't have one. It's my dad's.

923
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:42,531
米奇!
Mitch!

924
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:53,834
————什么?——嘿!最近怎么样，杰瑞?
- What the--? - Hey! How's it going, Jerry?

925
01:10:55,044 --> 01:10:56,629
你想要什么，奈特?
What do you want, Knight?

926
01:10:56,712 --> 01:11:00,007
世界和平。但我觉得现在不是讨论这个的时候。
World peace. But I don't think this is the time to discuss it.

927
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:03,260
——出去!-你可能会感兴趣，杰瑞。
- Get out! - Something might interest you, Jerry.

928
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:07,723
-你说什么我都不感兴趣。-海瑟薇博士…苏珊。
- I'm not interested in anything you say. - Dr. Hathaway... Susan.

929
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,483
我解决了电力问题，杰瑞。
I solved the power problem, Jerry.

930
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:22,279
杰里?
Jerry?

931
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:23,364
乘出租车。
Take a cab.

932
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:26,951
所以你以后再敲。
So you'll hammer later.

933
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,877
你也知道，米奇和我在研究氰化物系统。
As you know, Mitch and I were working on the cyanide system.

934
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:40,381
今天早些时候，它把自己吃掉了。
Well, earlier today, it ate itself.

935
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:45,886
但这正是我们向前迈出一大步所需要的。
But that's just what we needed to take a giant step forward.

936
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:46,971
肯特?
Right, Kent?

937
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:52,017
不用说，我对熔毁的事有点沮丧。
Needless to say, I was a little despondent about the meltdown.

938
01:11:52,101 --> 01:11:57,022
但就在我准备哈利卡里的时候，我突然想到了。
But then, in the midst of my preparations for hari-kari, it came to me.

939
01:11:58,107 --> 01:12:02,569
在氩基体中合成激发态溴是可能的。
It is possible to synthesize excited bromide in an argon matrix.

940
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:06,031
是的。它是一个处于激发态的准分子。
Yes. It's an excimer, frozen in its excited state.

941
01:12:06,115 --> 01:12:07,825
这是不可能的。
That's impossible.

942
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:10,744
这是化学激光器。但是是固态的，不是气态的。
It's a chemical laser. But in solid, not gaseous form.

943
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:16,625
简而言之，为了尊重你，肯特，这就像发射一根炸药。
Put simply, in deference to you, Kent, it's like lasing a stick of dynamite.

944
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:22,381
只要我们施加一个场，我们就耦合到一个与地面辐射耦合的状态。
As soon as we apply a field, we couple to a state that is radiatively coupled to the ground.

945
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:33,809
我想我们可以每立方厘米提取10的21次方个质子，也就是每立方厘米在600纳米或者每升有1兆焦耳。
I figure we can extract 10-to-the-21st protons per cubic centimeter, which will give 1 kilojoule per cubic centimeter at 600 nanometers or 1 megajoule per liter.

946
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:35,310
那比太阳还热。
That's hotter than the sun.

947
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:37,771
——这是小。-它应该很小。
- It's small. - It's supposed to be small.

948
01:12:37,855 --> 01:12:43,902
当然，我们只有一个样品…它会在激光的过程中自我毁灭。
Of course, we only have the one sample... and it's going to destroy itself as it lases.

949
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:49,324
但一切都会好起来的。
But everything's going to be fine.

950
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:53,328
-是吗，米奇?-是的。
- Isn't it, Mitch? - Yeah.

951
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:55,414
这完全是浪费时间。
This is a complete waste of time.

952
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:58,792
肯特，帮我个忙，把靶子放在煤渣砖前面，好吗?
Do me a favor, Kent, put the target in front of the cinder blocks, will you?

953
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:10,345
好的，到防护罩后面来。
Okay, come behind the shield.

954
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:22,691
-好的，泰勒先生。-随时准备好。
- Okay, Mr. Taylor. - Any time you're ready.

955
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,152
好的。
Okay.

956
01:13:26,028 --> 01:13:27,029
准备好了吗?
Ready?

957
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:28,822
激光!
Laser on!

958
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:33,118
哇!
Whoa!

959
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:37,581
——太棒了!——好吧!
- Fantastic! - All right!

960
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:42,377
看看这个!
Look at this!

961
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:48,509
哇。
Wow.

962
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:55,224
-对不起，窗户坏了，先生。-还有院子对面的树!
- Sorry about the window, sir. - And the trees across the quad!

963
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:56,809
-多好的团队啊!——是的!
- What a team! - Yeah!

964
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:03,357
-你做到了。-我也做了我该做的。
- You did it. - I did my part too.

965
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:06,318
你毕业。你得到了这份工作。
You graduate. You get the job.

966
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:09,905
什么? !你不能!那是我的工作。
What?! You can't! That's my job.

967
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:14,576
你让我做的我都做了。你不能这么做!
I've done everything you've ever asked me to. You can't do this!

968
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,203
看!看!
Look! Look!

969
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:17,996
我替你上你的课!
I teach your classes for you!

970
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:21,667
-我帮你拿衣服!-他在做什么?
- I get your laundry! - What is he doing?

971
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,168
看,看。
Look, look.

972
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:26,797
我安装了目标跟踪系统的光学装置。
I mounted the optics for the target-tracking system.

973
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,465
现在看看这面镜子。
Now look at this mirror.

974
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:30,467
看!看!
Look! Look!

975
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:36,807
等待。等待。
Wait. Wait.

976
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:39,434
——让我们好好庆祝一下吧!——当然。
- Let's celebrate! - Absolutely.

977
01:14:42,146 --> 01:14:44,314
你在校园里看到什么不寻常的东西了吗?
You see anything unusual on the campus?

978
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:51,196
——我的眼镜!-好吧，尽量别晃。
- My glasses! - Well, try not to wobble.

979
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:56,326
-有一个完整的洞。——这就是漂亮。
- There is a complete hole. - That's pretty.

980
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,411
看。
Look.

981
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:11,300
看那!
Look at that!

982
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:13,051
-我们去吃汉堡吧。- - - - - -来吧。
- Let's get a burger. - Come on.

983
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:14,678
——走吧!-什么，在里面?
- Let's go! - What, in there?

984
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:25,606
-这地方太狂野了。——什么?
- This place is wild. - What?

985
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:27,524
我可以把那些人打得落花流水。
I could clean those guys out at pool.

986
01:15:27,608 --> 01:15:28,817
你看到了吗?
Do you see that?

987
01:15:28,901 --> 01:15:31,612
你想见见她吗?她住在普拉亚德雷。
You wanna meet her? She lives in Playa del Rey.

988
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,864
-我会去见你父母吗?——没有。
- Am I gonna meet your parents? - No.

989
01:15:34,656 --> 01:15:38,619
——为什么?你为我感到羞耻吗?——不,他们!
- Why? Are you ashamed of me? - No, them!

990
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:39,870
哦!
Oh!

991
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:42,497
你最好记住该感谢的人。
You better remember the right people to thank on this.

992
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:45,709
——听好了。我要感谢我的鱼。-什么意思?
- Listen up. I'd like to thank my fish. - What do you mean?

993
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:47,794
-还有Ikagami先生!-哦，我喜欢。
- And Mr. Ikagami! - Oh, I love it.

994
01:15:47,878 --> 01:15:49,296
不，我说的是…
No, what I was talking about...

995
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:55,719
——这是,呃…-你想说什么?
- It's, uh... - What are you trying to say?

996
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:56,970
Lazlo。
Lazlo.

997
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:10,776
拉兹洛，我很高兴你出来了。你要一个汉堡包吗?
Lazlo, I'm so glad you came out. You want a hamburger?

998
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:12,986
我一直在考虑你的激光方案。
I've been thinking about your laser solution.

999
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,071
哦,很好。
Oh, good.

1000
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:18,408
我想你已经把输出功率增加到6兆瓦了。
I figure you've increased the power output to 6 megawatts.

1001
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:19,910
是的,。
Yeah, about that.

1002
01:16:20,994 --> 01:16:23,956
-你用它做什么?-做巨大的瑞士奶酪?
- What would you use that for? - Making enormous Swiss cheese?

1003
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,042
应用是无限的。
The applications are unlimited.

1004
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:31,630
不。用你想出来的燃料，光束能维持多久，15秒吧?
No. With the fuel you've come up with, the beam would last for what, 15 seconds?

1005
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:34,800
-那有什么用?-拉兹洛，那不重要
- What good is that? - Oh, Lazlo, that doesn't matter.

1006
01:16:34,883 --> 01:16:36,593
我尊重你，但我已经毕业了。
I respect you, but I graduated.

1007
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:40,055
让工程师们想办法利用它。这不关我们的事。
Let the engineers figure out a use for it. That's not our concern.

1008
01:16:40,138 --> 01:16:45,143
也许有人已经有了它的用途，它是专门为它设计的。
Maybe somebody already has a use for it, one for which it is specifically designed.

1009
01:16:45,227 --> 01:16:48,105
海瑟薇博士一直在想什么?
Dr. Hathaway had something in mind all along?

1010
01:16:48,188 --> 01:16:50,023
看看事实吧。
Look at the facts.

1011
01:16:50,107 --> 01:16:55,946
功率非常高，携带方便，发射时间有限，射程无限。
Very high power, portable, limited firing time, unlimited range.

1012
01:16:56,029 --> 01:17:02,286
你只需要一个跟踪系统和一个大旋转镜，你就可以从太空蒸发一个人类目标。
All you need is a tracking system and a large spinning mirror, and you could vaporize a human target from space.

1013
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:06,206
这并不好。
This is not good.

1014
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:15,716
不。
No.

1015
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:17,634
发生了什么事?
What happened?

1016
01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:23,390
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1017
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:26,852
——克里斯。-我没事。
- Chris. - I'm all right.

1018
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:36,028
-他们拿走了一切。-肯特的追踪系统没了!
- They took everything. - Kent's tracking system's gone!

1019
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:40,991
你怎么能造出那面镜子!
How could you build that mirror?!

1020
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:51,501
他骗了我们。
He lied to us.

1021
01:17:53,253 --> 01:17:55,088
骗你很容易，米奇。
It's easy to lie to you, Mitch.

1022
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,675
你信任的人。
You trust people.

1023
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:00,427
我是一个愤世嫉俗者。
I'm a cynic.

1024
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:04,848
我真是个混蛋。
I'm such an asshole.

1025
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,019
我理解你的感受，克里斯。你是对的。
I understand how you feel, Chris. And you're right.

1026
01:18:10,062 --> 01:18:12,939
但我们现在应该做的是找出他在做什么。
But what we should be doing now is finding out what he's doing.

1027
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,691
肯特。
Kent.

1028
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:23,492
嘘!你们。
Shh! You guys.

1029
01:18:44,054 --> 01:18:47,182
-我们有两分钟时间。两分钟。——原谅?
- We'll have two minutes. Two minutes. - Pardon?

1030
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:55,524
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hi.

1031
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,836
好了，张开他的嘴。
Okay, open his mouth.

1032
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:19,923
好的。斗牛犬。
Okay. Bulldogs.

1033
01:19:22,259 --> 01:19:23,301
和收发器。
And transceiver.

1034
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:25,637
和镊子。
And tweezers.

1035
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:31,518
是牙套给了我灵感。
See, it was the braces that gave me the idea.

1036
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:34,855
它们是完美的天线。他的整个脑袋变成了一个说话的人。
They're a perfect antennae. His whole head becomes a speaker.

1037
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:37,107
是时候有人好好利用它了。
It's about time someone put it to good use.

1038
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:45,907
肯特?
Kent?

1039
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:50,495
肯特。醒来,肯特。
Kent. Wake up, Kent.

1040
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:55,125
噢!
Ow!

1041
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,376
-肯特!——什么?
- Kent! - What?

1042
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,545
我在跟你说话，肯特。
I'm talking to you, Kent.

1043
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,301
-这是什么?-我说了，我在和你说话。
- What is this? - I said, I'm talking to you.

1044
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:06,219
——没有。-是的。
- No. - Yeah.

1045
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:10,432
我没睡着。
Well, I'm not asleep.

1046
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:15,187
-我一定是工作过度了。-你没有过度劳累，肯特。
- I must be overworked. - You're not overworked, Kent.

1047
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:17,564
我又没疯!
Well, I'm not insane!

1048
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:23,612
-我有吗?-那还有待观察，肯特
- Or am I? - That remains to be seen, Kent.

1049
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:25,864
但我们正在谈话。
But we are having a conversation.

1050
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:34,581
-你是谁?-这是耶稣，肯特。
- Okay, who is this? - This is Jesus, Kent.

1051
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:38,251
你是一个非常淘气的孩子!
And you've been a very naughty boy!

1052
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,757
好吧，你是谁?
All right, who is this?

1053
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,219
-少废话，肯特你造了个武器。——什么?
- Cut the crap, Kent. You built a weapon. - What?

1054
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:52,057
你以为秘密相位共轭跟踪系统是干什么用的?
What do you think a secret phase-conjugate tracking system is for?

1055
01:20:53,141 --> 01:20:56,269
大镜子形成大光束。
A big mirror makes a big beam.

1056
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,525
我想可能是吧。
I guess it could be.

1057
01:21:02,484 --> 01:21:04,319
激光现在在哪里?
Where's the laser now?

1058
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:11,451
我无意中听到杰瑞提到27号有个考试。
I overheard Jerry mention something about a test on the 27th.

1059
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:14,037
但我不知道在哪里。这是机密。
But I don't know where. It's classified.

1060
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:20,919
- - - - - -什么? !-哦，呃，没什么。
- What?! - Oh, uh, nothing.

1061
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:25,257
我要你想想你做了什么，肯特。
I want you to think about what you've done, Kent.

1062
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:30,095
从现在开始，别跟自己玩了!
And from now on, stop playing with yourself!

1063
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:36,601
它是上帝。
It is God.

1064
01:21:37,352 --> 01:21:38,436
现在怎么办呢?
Now what?

1065
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:43,942
第二阶段。
Phase two.

1066
01:21:46,403 --> 01:21:47,946
你是怎么回事?!
What is it with you?!

1067
01:23:30,674 --> 01:23:31,675
那是什么?
What's that?

1068
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:37,138
-这些军人太不信任人了。-我们不能进入基地?
- These military people are so untrusting. - We can't get on-base clearance?

1069
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:40,016
——我们将。-只需要6个小时
- We will. - It's just gonna take six hours.

1070
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,185
算了吧。我们将球。
Forget it. We'll balls it.

1071
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:43,436
这些看起来怎么样?
How do these look?

1072
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:47,816
糟透了。我的像他，他的像我。
Terrible. Mine looks like him, and his looks like me.

1073
01:23:49,693 --> 01:23:50,694
太好了,我希望。
Great, I hope.

1074
01:23:50,777 --> 01:23:53,738
-如果这些骗不了任何人呢?-他们向我们开枪。
- What if these don't fool anybody? - They shoot us.

1075
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,161
ID吗?
ID?

1076
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:07,043
-把这些给下一个门的警卫看。——好的。你的赌注。
- Show these to the guard at the next gate. - Okey-doke. You bet.

1077
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,182
id吗?
IDs?

1078
01:24:21,266 --> 01:24:23,059
嘿，你能把它收起来吗，伙计?我们刚飞过来。
Hey, can you snap it up, buddy? We just flew in.

1079
01:24:23,143 --> 01:24:27,063
我们迟到了，又累又饿，还租了辆破车。
We're late, we're tired, we're hungry, we rented this stupid car.

1080
01:24:27,147 --> 01:24:30,775
-你疯了吗?-你得恐吓他们。很酷。
- Are you out of your mind? - You gotta intimidate these guys. Be cool.

1081
01:24:31,985 --> 01:24:33,027
你不在名单上。
You're not on the list.

1082
01:24:33,945 --> 01:24:37,240
单吗?不在名单上。是啊，因为我们是机密。
List? Not on the list. Yeah, that's because we're classified.

1083
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:38,324
是的。
Yeah.

1084
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:41,286
安全。
Security.

1085
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:43,705
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1086
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:46,332
你们做技术员是不是太年轻了?
Aren't you guys a little young to be technicians?

1087
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,042
激光是一门年轻的科学。
Lasers are a young science.

1088
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:52,422
好的。好吧，是你逼我说的。现在我们都有麻烦了。
Okay. There, fine, you made me say it. Now we're both in trouble.

1089
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:54,340
听着，我会打电话给值班警官。
Look, I'll call the duty officer.

1090
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:57,635
——嗯…-你好，空降兵。
- Uh... - Hey there, uh, Airborne.

1091
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,224
不要这样做。
Don't do that.

1092
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:06,436
如果你打了电话，那就是我们的工作了。我们晚了四个小时。
If you make that call, it's our jobs. We're four hours late.

1093
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:09,689
-是的，先生-让我们休息一下，好吗?
- Yes, sir. - Give us a break, will you, buddy?

1094
01:25:09,773 --> 01:25:12,358
也许有一天你也会在私营部门工作，对吧?
Someday you might be in the private sector too, right?

1095
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:13,443
是的。
Yeah.

1096
01:25:16,321 --> 01:25:17,322
是的。
Yes.

1097
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:21,409
——我们死了。-哦,不。
- We're dead. - Oh, no.

1098
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:25,079
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1099
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:26,915
——好的。-我喜欢。
- All right. - I love it.

1100
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,168
当然,先生。
Absolutely, sir.

1101
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:32,212
把它完成了。
Consider it done.

1102
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:34,088
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

1103
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:40,220
-寻找任何不寻常的东西。——好的。
- Look for anything out of the ordinary. - Okay.

1104
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:44,599
米奇。米奇,过来。
Mitch. Mitch, come here.

1105
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:48,102
我的上帝。
My God.

1106
01:25:51,898 --> 01:25:52,982
好吧,来吧。
Okay, come on.

1107

1116
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:27,684
-所有的诊断似乎都没问题。-最后的检查准备好了。
- All the diagnostics seem okay. - Final check ready.

1117
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:29,269
65度，19分钟。
Sixty-five degrees, 19 minutes.

1118
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:31,604
经度44度零9分。
Longitude 44 degrees, zero, 9 minutes.

1119
01:26:38,111 --> 01:26:40,780
-所有系统准备。-我们结束了，伙计们
- All systems go. - We're finished here, fellas.

1120
01:26:48,121 --> 01:26:49,497
什么? !
What?!

1121
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:22,906
这个小多项式会让电脑忙到不知道我们在这里。
This little polynomial should keep the computer so busy, it doesn't even know we're here.

1122
01:27:26,576 --> 01:27:27,869
他们在哪儿?
Where are they?

1123
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,251
-有联系。他们在!——哦!
- Got a connection. They're in! - Oh!

1124
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,428
阿博特科斯特洛。
Abbott to Costello.

1125
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:47,430
-我是科斯特洛。去做吧。-我们有好东西。
- This is Costello. Go ahead. - We've got the goodies.

1126
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:50,808
我们已经计算出了目标坐标来进行轨迹调整。
We've got the target coordinates computed for trajectory adjustment.

1127
01:27:51,726 --> 01:27:53,853
收到，我们正在发送
Roger, we're sending.

1128
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:01,152
——哦。——哦。
- Uh-oh. - Uh-oh.

1129
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:02,278
它是什么?
What is it?

1130
01:28:05,907 --> 01:28:06,991
哦,没什么。
Oh, nothing.

1131
01:28:10,495 --> 01:28:13,539
你没想过我们会花这么多钱去太空测试吗?
You didn't think we'd blow all this money to test in space?

1132
01:28:13,623 --> 01:28:18,378
事实上，是的，我做了，因为这就是设计的目的。
Actually, yes, I did, because that is what it is designed for.

1133
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:25,343
但如果以你的智慧，你觉得我们应该先学爬再学走，我是说，那也没关系。真的。
But if, in your wisdom, you feel we should learn to crawl before we walk, I mean, that's fine too. Really.

1134
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:28,221
——注意!——什么?
- Attention! - What?

1135
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:31,557
-上级长官来了!-就像你一样。
- Superior officer in the room! - As you were.

1136
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:35,269
打扰一下。我们准备好进行最后的机载激光检查了。
Excuse me. We're ready for the final onboard laser check.

1137
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:37,355
嘘!
Shh!

1138
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:48,616
所有清晰。
All clear.

1139
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:51,786
我要把PROM换成EPROM。
I'm replacing the PROM with our EPROM.

1140
01:28:57,834 --> 01:28:58,835
好吧,开枪。
Okay, shoot.

1141
01:29:04,716 --> 01:29:06,259
请告诉我坐标好吗?
May I have the coordinates, please?

1142
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:13,766
北纬34度10分15秒21。
Thirty-four degrees, ten minutes, 15.21 seconds north.

1143
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:18,563
190度，7分钟……
One hundred nineteen degrees, seven minutes...

1144
01:29:24,152 --> 01:29:25,361
这边走。
Right over this way.

1145
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:29,866
我去检查楼梯。
I'm gonna check the stairs.

1146
01:29:42,879 --> 01:29:44,505
克里斯!海瑟薇的来了!
Chris! Hathaway's coming!

1147
01:29:44,589 --> 01:29:48,676
米奇刚刚通知我教授先生要来了。
Mitch has just informed me that Herr Professor is approaching.

1148
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,763
-我们该怎么办?!-请快点。海瑟薇的到来。
- What do we do?! - Please hurry. Hathaway's coming.

1149
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:54,057
请不要。我在压力下工作不好。
Please don't. I don't work well under pressure.

1150
01:29:57,435 --> 01:29:58,770
小心你的头。
Watch your head there.

1151
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:06,486
我希望这样可以。
I hope that does it.

1152
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:09,739
好吧，克里斯，我是说艾伯特。喂?喂?
Okay, Chris, I mean, Abbott. Hello? Hello?

1153
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:12,075
他们跑了!
They're gone!

1154
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:15,578
——好的。好吧。好吧。——好的。好吧。很好。
- Okay. Fine. Fine. - All right. Fine. Fine.

1155
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:21,042
戈伊医生会为你解答你可能有的其他问题。
Dr. Goy here will explain any additional questions you might have.

1156
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:24,378
是的。重复使用这个武器有什么问题吗?
Yes. Is there any problem with reusing the weapon?

1157
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:25,755
不,没有问题。
No, no problem.

1158
01:30:25,838 --> 01:30:31,344
燃料被冷冻并包含在一个自给自足的单元中——每次使用后都是可更换的。——我明白了。
The fuel is frozen and contained within a self-sufficient unit - that's replaceable after each use. - I see.

1159
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:38,434
这个系统的美妙之处在于燃料激光器…-这里一切都好吗?-为什么不呢?
The beauty of this system is that the fuel laser... - Is everything all right here? - Why shouldn't it be?

1160
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,691
只要它还有效，我们就去。很好。
As long as it remains operative, we're going. Fine.

1161
01:30:45,775 --> 01:30:50,613
好吧，我想这差不多就是总结了。你不?嗯…我们该走了吗?
Well, I think that just about sums it up. Don't you? Uh... Shall we take our exit?

1162
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:53,032
在我看来很小。
Looks small to me.

1163
01:30:59,205 --> 01:31:01,958
-好了，他们走了。-好险啊。
- Okay, they're gone. - That was close.

1164
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,877
没有比借B-1更好的了，对吧，将军?
Nothing like borrowing a B-1, huh, general?

1165
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:14,804
它是什么?
What is it?

1166
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:16,889
什么都没有。
Nothing.

1167
01:31:23,354 --> 01:31:27,233
客观个人分析诊断精神分裂症…
Diagnosis of schizophrenia by objective personal analysis...

1168
01:31:29,986 --> 01:31:32,530
——嗨,肯特。——哦。

1169
01:31:34,407 --> 01:31:35,783
我以为你已经走了。
I thought you'd gone.

1170
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:40,079
还没有。你一直在摸自己吗?
Not yet. Have you been touching yourself?

1171
01:31:40,163 --> 01:31:43,166
是的。我的意思是,不!
Yes. I mean, no!

1172
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:46,502
很好。听着,肯特。
Good. Listen, Kent.

1173
01:31:47,044 --> 01:31:51,757
爸爸，我爸爸，上帝，想给你看样东西。
Dad, you know, my father, God, wants to show you something.

1174
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:54,427
为什么?我的意思是,什么?
Why? I meant, what?

1175
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,596
我已经学会了不问。
I've learned not to ask.

1176
01:31:57,722 --> 01:32:06,981
他要你今天早上7点08分准时在艾维冠大道639号海瑟薇医生家门口等他。
He wants you to wait in front of Dr. Hathaway's house at 639 Ivy Crest Drive at precisely 7:08 this morning.

1177
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,401
艾薇顶吗?
Ivy Crest?

1178
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,362
就在那儿等着，你会收到信号的。
Just wait there and you shall receive a sign.

1179
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:15,990
不要绝望，不要走进去。
Do not despair and do not go inside.

1180
01:32:16,073 --> 01:32:17,325
好吧,为什么不呢?
Well, why not?

1181
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,121
喂?
Hello?

1182
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:25,249
你好,耶稣吗?
Hello, Jesus?

1183
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:30,922
他挂了电话。

他们在这里。
They're here.

1188
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:36,237
啊。奈特先生，为什么在这里见到你我一点都不惊讶?
Ah. Mr. Knight, why is it that I am not surprised to see you here?

1189
01:33:37,071 --> 01:33:43,369
我想你对我们将要见证的所谓事件有个解释吧。
And, uh, I suppose you have an explanation for this so-called event that we're to witness.

1190
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:48,457
是的，先生，我知道。但首先，我要称赞你的时尚品味。
Yes, sir, I do. But first, let me compliment you on your fashion sense.

1191
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:49,959
特别是你的拖鞋。

Ah. Congressman Doogan. What brings you around?

1196
01:34:06,642 --> 01:34:11,230
我听说这里发生了一件非常重要的国际事件。
I was told there was a situation here of critical international importance.

1197
01:34:18,195 --> 01:34:23,075
所有武器功能都由这个模块控制，就像在太空中一样。
All weapon functions are controlled from this module, as it would be in space.

1198
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:26,537
事实上，这是一模一样的汽车座舱。
In fact, this is an exact duplicate of the vehicle cockpit.

1199
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:28,956
精度和功率将是精确的。

-我们接近目标了。-开门。

弩，打开炸弹舱门。

-那是非常严重的指控。-是的，先生，我知道
- Those are very serious accusations. - Yes, sir. I know.

1203
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:49,310
如果是真的，我需要证据。
If it's true, I'm going to need proof.

1204
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,898
我想我们可以在一分钟内给你们安排时间。
I think we can accommodate you both in just one minute.

1205
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,441
鸭子。

现在，你听我说，耶稣。

这是杰瑞的房子…我们非常接近。
This is Jerry's house... and we're very close.

01:37:51,992 --> 01:37:54,036
我不明白你的意思。火吗?

01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:56,830
-开火了吗?-是的，但有个问题。

1228
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:05,881
肯特。

1229
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:11,345

I'll have to figure that out. But not this summer.

1255
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:31,318
-嗨。——雪莉?

1262
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:05,561
我在怀俄明州有个小小的求生之所。我们要住在那里。
I have a little survival place in Wyoming. We're gonna live there.

1263
01:41:05,644 --> 01:41:09,356
是啊，这里越来越奇怪了，你知道吗?
