1
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,659
Go on, girl!

2
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,834
Ralph! Ralph!

3
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:46,878
Whoa!

4
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,756
Ralph!

5
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,760
Morning!

6
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:55,471
Hello!

7
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,754
Well, here's a how-do-you do.

8
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:57,259
What is your name, young man?

9
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,428
Ralph Gower, an' it please you, sir.

10
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:01,347
l wouldn't lie to Your Worship.

11
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,808
You work these fields each year?

12
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:06,269
Yes, sir, l be ploughman
to Mistress Banham.

13
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:08,730
Ralph, you disturb me greatly with this tale.

14
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,358
l don't mean to, ma'am.

15
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:15,321
lf you have unearthed a corpse, man,
summon your local Justice.

16
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:18,908
- lt's hardly a case for me.
- But it weren't human, sir.

17
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,994
There were a fur.

18
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:24,540
Fur? Then it was an animal's remains.

19
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,379
- You're wasting my time.
- No, sir, honest.

20
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:32,173
lt were more like some fiend.

21
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:38,055
You see, my dear lsobel,
the way these old superstitions die hard.

22
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:42,101
Come and look, sir, then you'll believe me.

23
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:45,313
Pray, dear Judge,
do ascertain the truth of his story.

24
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:48,316
Merely to set my mind at rest.

25
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,780
Very well.

26
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,658
We'll investigate your fiend.

27
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,830
Come.

28
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,892
There be the master with a lady.

29
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,560
Uh-huh.

30
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:22,104
l would have Cathy for my lady one day.

31
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:26,610
Be that true? You've run away?

32
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,987
Did ye climb down a ladder
in the moonlight?

33
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,909
Ha, ha! Just so, Cathy.
And her father chased after us with a stick.

34
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:36,203
l do wish Ralph would run away
with me some time.

35
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,414
Ha!

36
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:41,919
Mistress Banham. Mistress Banham.

37
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:45,130
- What is it, Ellen?
- 'Tis Mr Peter with a young lady.

38
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:47,842
What's that?

39
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:53,932
Oh, look, 'tis Miss Rosalind Barton.
l heard he be courting her.

40
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:55,976
(Mistress Banham) A farmer's daughter.

41
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,396
Be they wed? Shall we have
a new young mistress in the house?

42
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,399
No, Ellen, we shall not.
Be about your business.

43
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:04,903
Ellen?

44
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:15,665
Am l fit to meet your aunt?
l pray she will like me.

45
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:19,168
Oh, you may be assured she will. Come on.

46
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,464
Come on, girl. Come on.

47
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,305
Are you there, Aunt?

48
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,934
l want you to meet Miss Rosalind Barton.

49
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,355
She and l are to be married tomorrow.

50
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:41,068
Rosalind, l want you to meet my aunt,
Mistress Banham.

51
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,031
You disappoint me, Peter.

52
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,243
The judge was offended
when you did not have lunch with him.

53
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:49,953
He's a most important man.

54
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:55,876
'Tis an honour to meet you, Mistress
Banham. 'Tis a grand house you have here.

55
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,674
So, Miss Barton, you intend
to marry my nephew. ls that it?

56
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,855
Well, Ralph?

57
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:18,569
But sir, it were just here. l swear it.
The plough had turned it up.

58
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:22,489
- Human remains.
- No, sir. A sort of head, a face.

59
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:25,702
Of a fiend?

60
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,333
l must surmise, Ralph,
that you're wasting my time.

61
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,211
Hey!

62
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,054
l nearly lost him. Good day, Ralph.

63
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:44,014
Good day, Reverend.

64
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,391
Good day, sir.

65
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:48,269
Friendly creatures.

66
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:51,105
Ubique opera domini.

67
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:55,235
This be Reverend Fallowfield,
your worship. He's our curate.

68
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:57,154
Aha.

69
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:02,785
Ralph here claims he discovered
a deformed anatomy in those furrows.

70
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:06,873
Knew you of any such?

71
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:09,209
Not since Meg Parsons died.

72
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:14,340
But strange folk have been seen
to pass this way....

73
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,551
from time to time.

74
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:19,680
l see.

75
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:48,795
So, young people, your elders triumph.

76
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:52,633
lt does not appear that Miss Barton
is the perfect partner for you.

77
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:55,511
No doubt in other respects,
she will do better.

78
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:57,888
l hope you will all excuse me if l retire.

79
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:02,519
l hope the young lady doesn't propose
to stay here,

80
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:04,855
under the same roof as her intended.

81
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:10,028
Well, sir,
it may not appear correct, sir.

82
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,530
Quite incorrect.

83
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:15,450
Surely she can go home?

84
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,578
No, sir. That's the trouble.

85
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:23,042
- Ah.
- Aunt, where shall Rosalind sleep?

86
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:27,589
The Judge is passing the night here.
Far too late for him to return to the inn.

87
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:30,342
- Then Rosalind shall have my room.
- No.

88
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,304
No, she can have the attic.

89
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:37,350
But it hasn't been inhabited
these five years. The room is filthy.

90
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:39,728
Tush. Ellen will prepare it.

91
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,980
lt's a charming room.

92
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,361
Why does your aunt dislike me so?

93
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:49,781
She suspects you're with child.

94
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,660
There, there, my sweet.

95
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:56,121
All will be well tomorrow.

96
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,795
- Whose are these things?
- My uncle's.

97
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:05,590
He died ten years ago.

98
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:09,761
- Peter, do l have to sleep here?
- Be patient, my love.

99
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:14,392
l shall come to you at 11 o'clock, when
my aunt and the judge are both asleep.

100
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,438
l do love you.

101
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:24,027
Better you go now.

102
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:26,154
Your aunt.

103
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,784
11 o'clock, then.

104
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,929
So, young man,

105
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,307
beware the wiles of women.

106
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,396
l tell you, in confidence,

107
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:59,693
a long time ago,

108
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:03,238
l was your aunt's admirer.

109
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:14,918
l give you His Catholic Majesty,
King James lll.

110
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,838
God bless him and keep him in exile.

111
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,741
Peter?

112
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,374
Peter, is that you?

113
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,340
Peter?

114
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,778
Ah!

115
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:41,807
Rosalind! Rosalind!

116
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:46,855
What have you been doing? What is it?

117
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:51,360
- What is it?
- Oh!

118
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:01,038
What is it?

119
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:12,508
Come out. The sight of you disturbs her.

120
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,679
What have you been doing?
Let me get in there.

121
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:22,311
Still, you little vixen. Do you hear me?

122
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,899
- Stay still.
- Rosalind!

123
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:31,656
Oh! She scratched me.

124
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:38,704
Ellen, fetch Ralph.

125
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,792
l want nails and some wood.

126
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:45,462
ls there a doctor near?

127
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:47,590
Oh!

128
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:02,022
- No!
- She is beyond our reach.

129
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,277
Tomorrow, the men from the bedlam
will take her into care.

130
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,028
The madhouse?

131
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,406
Judge yourself fortunate, young man.

132
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,577
She could never have been
the fit wife for you.

133
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:28,594
The fever is high.

134
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:31,723
There are so many sick of unknown
maladies in these parts,

135
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:34,225
l fear a general plague.

136
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,520
We have much to learn.

137
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:39,815
- Have you some eau de vie?
- Yes, sir. l'll fetch you some.

138
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,490
- What is happening to me?
- Pray, do not distress yourself.

139
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:51,287
You merely have some distemper,
as yet unknown to me.

140
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,625
l will open a vein
and the humour will, perhaps, pass out.

141
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:04,676
lf she's bled, 'twill ease her.
lt's all l can do.

142
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:25,075
You look. l don't want to.

143
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,702
Cathy's afeard.

144
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:29,829
l heard screams last night.

145
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:32,667
No. You dreamed 'em, you mean.

146
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,336
l wanna be back to the farm.

147
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,463
There's to be a wedding.

148
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:39,716
A wedding?

149
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,552
Yeah. l heard.

150
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,721
But Ma sent me and Mark away.

151
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:48,476
T'ain't right.

152
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,937
l found summat.

153
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,189
Here, let us see.

154
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:57,778
- No.
- Come on, Angel.

155
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:03,075
Thou must do a forfeit.

156
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,915
Angel.

157
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,920
Wait for me!

158
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,753
'Tis a sorry day for us all.

159
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,343
Young master's heart is quite broke.

160
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,638
Poor lass.

161
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,601
Whatever will become of her
in that terrible place?

162
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,814
Oh.

163
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,880
Mistress Banham. Mistress Banham!

164
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,054
Mistress, where be you?

165
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:17,643
Did the mistress come this way, sir?

166
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:23,775
- l think not.
- Well, l can't see her nowhere.

167
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:25,986
She'm disappeared.

168
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,957
''..and let fall some of the handfuls
on purpose for her

169
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:41,420
''and leave them and she might glean them
and rebuke her not.''

170
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,053
Tell me, why was Boaz
thus gentle toward Ruth?

171
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:57,772
- For...
- Yes, boy?

172
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,194
For he were a man and she were a woman.

173
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,785
lt was the will of God that he knew of her.

174
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,288
Go on, show it.

175
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,961
How can you glean any benefit
for your souls

176
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,714
if you will not listen to the holy writ?

177
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,929
As the Lord himself hath said,

178
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:28,973
''Those who have ears to hear,
let them hear.''

179
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:31,602
Uh!

180
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,897
Ann, give me that.

181
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:38,234
She ain't got nothing, Reverend.

182
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,660
(Screams)

183
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,921
Angela.

184
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:06,641
Give me that bag.

185
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:11,605
Plain vanished, Reverend.

186
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,754
Given up the chase, have you?

187
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:36,342
We done our best, sir.
We searched everywheres, hereabout.

188
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:41,597
ln heaven's name, she cannot have
gone far. Search again. Be off with you.

189
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:48,980
Silly old fool. Why don't he go
and search 'is bloody self?

190
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:01,662
They've lost the scent completely, milord.

191
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,748
My hounds could have done better.

192
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:08,419
She must have the constitution of an ox.

193
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,630
She was a sick woman.

194
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,633
lndeed, Your Honour, as you say,
she was a sick woman.

195
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:21,517
l must confess, sir,
l fear there's something very strange afoot.

196
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,896
Did you hear what Gower turned up
with his plough?

197
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:29,776
Justice Middleton, l myself
examined the furrows.

198
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:33,072
There was nothing.

199
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:35,199
Nothing. Of course.

200
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,993
Unless it were witchcraft.

201
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:41,540
There have been some cases.

202
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:43,667
Witchcraft?

203
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:46,128
Hm.

204
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:50,299
Damnable business, Mr Edmonton, eh?

205
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,554
Fear nothing. The hunt goes on.

206
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:59,393
Milord, will you sup with me tonight?

207
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,688
Only humble fare but the finest
in the shire.

208
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,941
Thank you, Squire.

209
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,485
l remain here tonight.

210
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:10,155
The lady was a dear friend of mine.

211
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:12,908
Naturally. Out of respect.

212
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:16,746
Well, gentlemen, l take my leave.

213
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,736
There's evil in this house.

214
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:48,073
You must cleanse your mind
of such fancies.

215
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:53,871
Would they had taken me with her.

216
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,999
Time will relieve all.

217
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,713
And rest.

218
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,969
Go to your room and l'll go to mine.

219
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,515
Ellen...

220
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,434
my candle.

221
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:30,281
Ah!

222
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:47,169
Water, Ellen, and bandages.
Send Ralph to get the doctor.

223
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:07,651
My lord, when l heard
of Ralph Gower's discovery,

224
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:10,904
- l was reminded of this old volume.
- (Scoffs)

225
00:29:10,987 --> 00:29:12,948
Mock, sir, if you will.

226
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:17,620
These sages had access to much wisdom.
Ah, here we are.

227
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:20,373
Doctor, witchcraft is dead.

228
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:22,709
And discredited.

229
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:25,754
Are you bent on reviving forgotten horrors?

230
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:28,215
How do we know, sir, what is dead?

231
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:33,555
You come from the city.
You cannot know the ways of the country.

232
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,558
See, this picture.

233
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:48,446
Did not Ralph describe
such a countenance?

234
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:54,287
Perhaps some such thing.

235
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:03,589
The drug is wearing off.

236
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,883
His heartbeat is strong.

237
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:10,513
Doctor, l am leaving soon.

238
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:14,017
As a favour, might l request
the loan of this book?

239
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,814
lt might merit further study.

240
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:31,912
No good news, l regret, milord.

241
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:36,292
l've had to call off the chase.
There's no trace of the lady anywhere.

242
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,586
l fear she is lost to us.

243
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,088
Er... And how is it with the young fella?

244
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,802
The doctor is confident
that Mr Edmonton will survive.

245
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,012
Splendid. Thankful for small mercies.

246
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,226
l have to leave you now.

247
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,853
Ooh, of course. Affairs of state.

248
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,815
Fear not, milord,
the matter is in good hands.

249
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,194
Unfortunate you could not sup with me.

250
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,364
Most unfortunate.

251
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,159
Yes.

252
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,206
Assist His Lordship there.

253
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,002
Your Lordship,

254
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,214
please don't you desert us.

255
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:21,050
Squire Middleton will keep watch over you.

256
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,595
l have important business in London.

257
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,224
You shall spread no more rumours,
Ralph Gower. Understand?

258
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,351
Witchcraft. Pah!

259
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:32,814
Perhaps you will have peace from now on.

260
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:36,151
There will be no nonsense, sir.
l am father to all here.

261
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:38,487
They love me but they obey me first.

262
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:41,031
Have a pleasant journey, Your Lordship.

263
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,827
l shall not forget you.

264
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,747
l shall return when the time is right.

265
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,627
But you must have patience.

266
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:57,466
Even while people die. Only thus
can the whole evil be destroyed.

267
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:01,345
You must let it grow.

268
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:09,229
(Man) Come along. Come on.

269
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,685
Thou'll be man of the house now, Ralph.

270
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,896
Till the master's better.

271
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:10,048
- Come on, Mark. We'll be home soon.
- We'll be all right.

272
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:13,468
Oh, she's a devil, that Angel.
She be no friend of mine.

273
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:17,056
T'weren't her. She likes me.
T'were that thing she keeps.

274
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:21,519
Oh, l told her she shouldn't have touched it.
Oh Lord, Mark, what'll come o' thee?

275
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:25,107
Well, l were holding the claw
and Angel were laughing.

276
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,777
- Suddenly l gets this pain...
- Oh, sh. Don't tell.

277
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:31,698
Say a prayer. l'll say one with thee.

278
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,534
Our Father...
(Mark) Our Father...

279
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:37,078
- which art in heaven...
- which art in heaven...

280
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:39,623
- Hallowed be Thy name...
- Hallowed be Thy name...

281
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,542
Thy kingdom come...

282
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,045
T'ain't nothing, Ma. Pain's gone. l promise.

283
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:48,466
You just sit there.
Cathy, get thee to Scripture class.

284
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,054
l'll go to the doctor for medicine
that will settle thee straightway.

285
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:56,517
- But Ma, l be perfect.
- Hush, now.

286
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,312
- l'll be back in a twinkling.
- Bye, Ma.

287
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:02,733
Bye, chick. You come
straight home, mind, after.

288
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:05,944
- Does tha want any broth?
- No.

289
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,739
- Does tha wanna go to bed?
- No.

290
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:11,910
You just sit there quiet and l won't be long.

291
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,623
Take an apple.

292
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:40,426
Wilt thou come and play with us, Mark?

293
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:42,553
Please.

294
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:45,514
l don't play girls' games.

295
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,143
Angel has taught us some new games.

296
00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:51,229
Please come.

297
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:54,233
Angel wants thee.

298
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,760
l see only half my class
have deigned to come today.

299
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:21,847
Mark Vespers is truant, for one.

300
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,892
Oh, no, Reverend, sir. He were took sick.

301
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,941
Have all the others, then,
succumbed to Mark's distemper?

302
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,863
Where's Angel Blake?

303
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:43,830
Angel sends regards, Reverend.

304
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:46,041
Who spoke?

305
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:51,631
Says she'm sorry she could not attend but
she had some fearful important things to do.

306
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:58,681
There is, growing amongst you all,

307
00:36:58,764 --> 00:37:02,726
an insolent ungodliness
which l will not tolerate!

308
00:37:03,477 --> 00:37:06,982
lt's no common disease
which keeps half my class away

309
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:10,485
Round and around
and around and around.

310
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:42,313
Ooh-ooh!

311
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:48,028
oo-ooh!

312
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,035
Yoo-hoo!

313
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:57,955
Come on.

314
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:43,549
Oh! Who did that?

315
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:45,676
Ooh.

316
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:52,850
That cost good silver, that did.
That were for Mark.

317
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:56,646
Save your pains, mistress.
Mark won't need it no more.

318
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:01,277
What does that mean, boy?

319
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,238
We... we shut him
in the woodshed.

320
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,784
Hey!

321
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:27,347
Mark?

322
00:39:34,063 --> 00:39:36,107
Mark?

323
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:54,003
Mark. Mark.

324
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:56,797
Mark. (Sobbing) Mark.

325
00:39:56,881 --> 00:39:58,883
What...?

326
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:05,015
What have they done?

327
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:12,273
Mark. Oh, my Mark.

328
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,400
My Mark.

329
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,034
There.

330
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:37,802
Angel.

331
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:51,943
l'm glad you're here.

332
00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:55,280
l've been meaning to speak
with you, Angel Blake.

333
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:00,077
Yes, sir?

334
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:08,003
Your behaviour, Angel,
has been most unseemly, of late.

335
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:10,881
l mean to complain to your father of it.

336
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:25,439
Do you like what you see?

337
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:29,235
Shame on you, child.

338
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:33,239
Do you like me, sir?

339
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:35,366
You...

340
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,164
You are beautiful, Angel.

341
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,258
- Do you wanna play our games with us?
- No, no.

342
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,469
Cover yourself up.

343
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:55,848
We want you with us, sir.

344
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:58,643
The Lord have mercy on you.

345
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:02,564
Come with me.

346
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,693
Get away!

347
00:42:09,364 --> 00:42:12,659
l never want to see you in this school again.

348
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:14,786
Damn you, you old pagan.

349
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:18,582
Would you like to know
what becomes of your precious pupils?

350
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,502
One of them is dead already.

351
00:42:22,378 --> 00:42:25,047
Little Mark had the devil in him.

352
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,300
So we cut it out.

353

- Well, it's about my daughter, sir.

- What?

He be no true man of God, sir.

Tell the Squire, Angel.

l scarce can tell it.

402
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:42,519
You see, sir, he called me back to class
the other night,

403
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:44,897
cos he said l'd been doing wrong.

404
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,651
And he asked me to take my dress off.

405
00:45:47,734 --> 00:45:50,445
l wouldn't, sir.

406
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:53,616
l ran and he caught me
and tore up my dress.

l were so afeard.

408

And she were bleeding.

410
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:06,255
He told me if l didn't obey him,

411
00:46:06,338 --> 00:46:08,882
the same'd happen to me as did to Mark.

412
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:12,887
l didn't know what he meant, sir.

413
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:15,056
l be so scared, Squire.

414
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:19,478
The villain. By God,

415
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:23,065
l'll put a stop to your games,
Reverend Fallowfield.

416

God willing, the squire
will find the murderer soon.

417

Oh.

419
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:03,777

- Ooh, nothing, Ma. lt's all right.

420

Don't you fret, Cathy, my love.

His soul's at rest.

422
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:24,885
Did you see, Ma? lt's not everyone
he calls ''my love'' like that, is it?

423
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,049
- Hello.
- Hello.

424
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:30,475
Poor Cathy. We were so sad
about your Mark.

425
00:48:31,935 --> 00:48:34,230
Yeah. Poor Mark.

426
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:37,525
Has thou seen Ralph Gower anywhere?

427
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:39,652
No.

428
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,450
Those be fine flowers. What they be for?

429
00:48:45,534 --> 00:48:47,786
For my brother. To put on his grave.

430
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:51,749
We've seen some real giants.
Fine, long stems they got.

431
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,836
- Where?
- Well, not far. Come on.

- Come on, then.
- Oh!

435
00:49:10,228 --> 00:49:13,149
- Gotcha! Come on.
- (Cathy laughs and shrieks)

436
00:49:24,578 --> 00:49:26,621
There, boy.

437
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:46,478
- Where's Will?
- He'll be back.

438
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,190
- Where we going?
- For the flowers.

439
00:49:50,273 --> 00:49:53,694
- A secret place.
- You said we wouldn't go far.

440
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:57,907
(Screaming) Let me go!

441
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,618
Whoa.

442

This be a good game.
We be cannibals and you be our catch.

443
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:15,802
You're hurting me. Play by yourselves.

444
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:18,514
Sorry, Miss Cathy.

445
00:50:19,348 --> 00:50:21,475
Aw, come on, play with us.

446
00:50:21,558 --> 00:50:23,727
lt's only a game.

447
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:05,691
Oh, the rope!

448
00:51:29,217 --> 00:51:30,678
Come on, Cathy.

449

Ca-thy!

450
00:51:55,163 --> 00:51:58,125
What is this? Squire, you're mistaken.

451
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,711
You are charged with ravishing Angel Blake.

452
00:52:00,794 --> 00:52:04,924
And in addition, you are suspect
of the murder of Mark Vespers.

453
00:52:06,175 --> 00:52:08,219
Sir, you wrong me.

454
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:10,222
We'll take him to the farm.

455
00:52:10,306 --> 00:52:15,102
His memory might improve when he is
taken to the scene of his unnatural crime.

00:55:32,491 --> 00:55:34,994
Angel Blake leading 'em.

484
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:37,455
And Cathy? l heard her calling.

485
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:39,708
Never seed her.

486
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:44,087
But they'm often round here now,
singing and playing their games.

487
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:44,030
No! No!

488
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:02,477
Cathy? Cathy!

489
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:12,280
Cathy?

490
00:59:18,996 --> 00:59:21,040
Cathy!

491
00:59:29,925 --> 00:59:33,053
The whole countryside
talks of your evil doings.

492
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,431
Now, by God, we will be shamed no longer.

493
00:59:35,514 --> 00:59:37,934
Here is the place. Bring him in.

494
00:59:38,018 --> 00:59:41,438
There. Confess.

495
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:44,482
Sir, l loved that child.
l know not how he died.

496
00:59:44,566 --> 00:59:46,819
You know and you shall hang.

497
00:59:46,902 --> 00:59:49,196
Come, what was the weapon?

498
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,956
This axe. You see, men,
his silence condemns him.

499
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,541
Squire.

500
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,087
Merciful Lord.

501
01:00:08,593 --> 01:00:10,888
l found her in the ruined church.

502
01:00:12,765 --> 01:00:14,892
lt were Angel Blake.

503
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,146
Ned Carter saw her
and the children with her.

504
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,909
Release him. We will strike
while the iron's hot.

505
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:25,471
l have not forgotten you.

506
01:01:27,098 --> 01:01:29,643
Your village has been much in my thoughts.

507
01:01:33,063 --> 01:01:35,316
Oh, you would not recognise it, sir.

508
01:01:35,399 --> 01:01:39,821
Dreadful things are commonplace and
mere children commit the foulest deeds.

509
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:42,615
Children? What deeds?

510
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,119
They... they murder one another.

511
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:48,998
We fear that witchcraft has returned.

512
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,045
lt is more than witchcraft.

513
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:56,298
l am ready to return.

514
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:03,598
But understand,

515
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:06,517
l shall use undreamed-of measures.

516
01:02:48,732 --> 01:02:50,776
Come on!

517
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:53,070
There she is!

518
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,635
There she is!

519
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,164
Get her!

520
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:44,377
This way!

521
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,048
Go on!

522
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:49,300
Get her to speak!

523
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:07,487
No.

524
01:04:11,492 --> 01:04:13,911
Let's chuck her in, see if she's a witch.

525
01:04:15,996 --> 01:04:17,874
No!

526
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,051
- What you done?
- Her's a witch.

527
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:29,762
- Aye, so we swung her, eh?
- See if she floats.

528
01:04:29,845 --> 01:04:35,769
- How do you know she be a witch?
- We know if she don't sink, she be one.

529
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:38,230
lf she sink, you done her murder.

530
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,660
- Who is she then?
- l dunno.

531
01:05:28,829 --> 01:05:31,498
They chased her and throwed her
in the lake,

532
01:05:31,582 --> 01:05:34,168
to see if she'd float like a witch.

533
01:05:34,251 --> 01:05:39,007
- Oh, glory. And is she, then?
- No. She sank straightaway.

534
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,343
But none would pull her out.

535
01:05:41,426 --> 01:05:45,639
For a moment, l thought 'twas my Cathy
you were bringing back to me.

536
01:05:45,723 --> 01:05:47,767
Ellen.

537
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:52,814
Oh, praise God. Ralph, bring her to the fire
and we'll get her warm. Quickly.

538
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:06,037
Ralph, get me a rag.

539
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:15,047
Ralph, bring Cathy's bed in here.
This poor lass shall have it.

540
01:06:41,744 --> 01:06:43,913
Ralph, look. Look.

541
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:49,128
What is it?

542
01:06:50,337 --> 01:06:52,881
Oh, God, l prayed l'd never see that again.

543
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:57,512
That's what they call the devil's skin.

544
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,898
- Let her die, say l.
- No, sir, she's no witch.

545
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,192
Well, let the squire put her in jail.

546
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,864
- There, at least, she'll do no harm.
- Could we not take pity on her?

547
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:17,617
'Tis the mark of the devil.
No wonder the villagers were afraid of her.

548
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,786
lt's madness to keep her here.

549
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,000
Doctor, could you not
cut the skin from her leg?

550
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:28,004
To what purpose?
The skin would only grow again.

551
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:31,133
Besides, the operation is too difficult.

552
01:07:31,216 --> 01:07:33,969
l... l am not equipped.

553
01:07:34,053 --> 01:07:36,556
'Twas not l who first ploughed up the field.

554
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:39,809
We'd like to save her, sir, for Cathy's sake.

555
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:42,145
But we have not the skill.

556
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,502
God grant we may not waste our pains.

557
01:08:11,011 --> 01:08:13,305
lf she wakes, hold her fast.

558
01:09:39,903 --> 01:09:43,239
There. Not so bad.

559
01:09:43,323 --> 01:09:45,534
Oh, the Lord be praised.

560
01:09:47,078 --> 01:09:49,538
There, my chick, there.

561
01:09:49,622 --> 01:09:52,334
There, thou be as right as rain.

562
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:54,461
- We must burn that skin.
- Yeah.

563
01:09:54,544 --> 01:09:57,422
- Destroy it good and proper.
- Yes, yes.

564
01:09:57,506 --> 01:10:01,219
Oh. There's no blood. That's strange.

565
01:10:01,302 --> 01:10:03,721
Yes, very strange.

566
01:10:21,241 --> 01:10:25,413
- Shall l live?
- Course thou shall, child.

567
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:27,665
What is thy name?

568
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,669
Margaret.

569
01:10:32,587 --> 01:10:35,841
- l'm the devil's child.
- Oh, hush.

570
01:10:35,924 --> 01:10:38,176
Thou art my child now.

571
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:42,473
No. l must go to my master.

572
01:10:42,557 --> 01:10:44,392
Oh.

573
01:10:45,435 --> 01:10:47,645
Why do my leg pain me so?

574
01:11:02,078 --> 01:11:05,416
See, thou lucky lass. Ellen cares for thee.

575
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:08,252
l bring thee flowers.

576
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:11,547
Soon thou'll be fit to walk as well as l.

577
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,009
Then l shall run away.

578
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:16,011
Angel wants me.

579
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:18,138
Now listen here, Margaret.

580
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:20,767
Angel has gone from these parts.

581
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:23,227
Thou dost not serve her any more.

582
01:11:26,314 --> 01:11:28,817
Thou stole my master's skin.

583
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:31,111
Thou shalt pay with thine.

584
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:34,364
Now leave thy threats
or the Lord will punish thee.

585
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:37,535
My lord is stronger. Soon he will be.

586
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:42,165
Come thou and serve him.

587
01:11:42,248 --> 01:11:46,754
We honour thee for it was thee
who first set my master free.

588
01:11:48,714 --> 01:11:50,925
Thou shalt lie with Angel.

589
01:11:52,302 --> 01:11:54,513
Thou shalt lie with me.

590
01:11:56,473 --> 01:11:58,850
Why did l think thou could be saved?

591
01:12:02,397 --> 01:12:05,024
Curse the day l ploughed in Tarrant's field.

592
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:14,952
Good day, Ralph. How is't with the lass?

593
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:19,999
Oh, surely you're not afflicted now?

594
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:22,335
Oh, sir, it is a hopeless case.

595
01:12:22,419 --> 01:12:25,047
She talks of nothing but the devil,
her master.

596
01:12:25,131 --> 01:12:26,632
Oh.

597
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:52,244
l was certain we could have saved her.

598
01:12:54,788 --> 01:12:57,208
The news from the village is grave, too.

599
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:59,419
Every day, someone is missed.

600
01:12:59,502 --> 01:13:01,755
They do say the fiend
has been seen hereabouts,

601
01:13:02,088 --> 01:13:04,383
hobbling on one leg, they say.

602
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:06,510
Margaret!

603
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:09,930
Margaret?

604
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:12,476
- Margaret!
- (Ralph) What is it?

605
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:16,146
Seen Margaret? She's run away.

606
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:18,648
Margaret!

607
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:22,361
Margaret. Margaret!

608
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:25,698
Margaret? Margaret!

609
01:13:25,782 --> 01:13:28,327
Margaret!
Margaret!

610
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:31,455
Margaret!
Margaret!

611
01:13:31,538 --> 01:13:36,795
l shall be named. She'll report me
to her godless clan. They'll punish me.

612
01:13:36,878 --> 01:13:39,756
Don't you fret, sir. Margaret!

613
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:44,553
- Who's that?
- They're coming for us.

614
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:46,972
lt's the master.

615
01:13:47,765 --> 01:13:51,227
(Peter) Ahoy, there! How goes it with you?

616
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:53,480
l brought assistance.

617
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:09,748
Whoa!

618
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:15,754
My lord, we're in a desperate plight.
You can't imagine. The village is going mad.

619
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:17,424
Welcome back, sir.

620
01:14:17,507 --> 01:14:21,094
The devil himself is coming among us,
like in the book l showed you.

621
01:14:21,177 --> 01:14:23,638
l owe you thanks for that book, Doctor.

622
01:14:29,228 --> 01:14:31,480
Well, dear friends, be brief.

623
01:14:32,482 --> 01:14:35,944
This parish is diseased.
What are the symptoms?

624
01:14:36,027 --> 01:14:39,281
Oh, sir, my poor children, both are gone.

625
01:14:39,364 --> 01:14:43,286
And countless others, maybe.
They give their bodies to the devil.

626
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:47,081
- My poor Ellen.
- We found a girl has bore the devil's skin.

627
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:49,585
The doctor cut it out.

628
01:14:49,668 --> 01:14:51,962
Come in. Tell me more of this.

629
01:15:04,685 --> 01:15:08,314
Where is this girl, this devil worshipper?

630
01:15:10,483 --> 01:15:15,072
- She escaped, my lord.
- Ralph, again you just give me stories.

631
01:15:15,155 --> 01:15:17,282
Have you no evidence?

632
01:15:17,365 --> 01:15:21,704
Where, for instance, is this girl
that Peter talks of? This Angel Blake?

633
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:24,457
My lord, l... l have something here.

634
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,627
- What is it?
- lt's the skin l cut from Margaret.

635
01:15:41,392 --> 01:15:43,603
This will be sufficient.

636
01:15:48,692 --> 01:15:50,736
Yes.

637
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:56,034
l mean to run this devil of yours to earth,

638
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,245
if he exists.

639
01:16:04,502 --> 01:16:08,465
These dogs know
how to tear the devil's heels.

640
01:16:08,549 --> 01:16:12,261
But sir, many are afflicted.
lnnocent folk may be hurt.

641
01:16:12,344 --> 01:16:14,721
Leave me to judge who is innocent.

642
01:16:29,822 --> 01:16:31,866
Angel!

643
01:16:35,078 --> 01:16:37,122
Angel, are you here?

Save me, Angel. The dogs are after me.

650
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:01,441
What has thou done, Margaret?

651
01:17:01,524 --> 01:17:05,321
Nothing. l'm afeard.

652

01:17:09,575 --> 01:17:11,619
Come to me.

654
01:17:14,581 --> 01:17:16,416
Aah!

655
01:17:26,135 --> 01:17:29,723
- Telltale bitch, thou set the dogs on me.
- Course l didn't.

656
01:17:29,807 --> 01:17:33,143
- Get me out of this.
- What dogs? Whose dogs?

657
01:17:33,227 --> 01:17:36,272
l don't know,
they've been chasing me for miles.

658
01:17:36,356 --> 01:17:39,275
Ah. They could be from the farm.

659
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:42,987
- Farm?
- Edmonton's. They kept me there a week.

660
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:47,618
- What did thou tell them, Margaret?
- Oh, nothing.

661
01:17:48,577 --> 01:17:52,874
Oh! Nothing. l swear. Get me out of this.

662
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:55,210
They just kept you there?

663
01:17:55,293 --> 01:17:58,088
Yes. Oh, let me out.

664
01:17:58,171 --> 01:18:00,716
Art thou ready to give thy skin tonight?

665
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,010
Art thou ready?

666
01:18:03,094 --> 01:18:05,221
Let me see.

667
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,151
They did it to me.

668
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,946
There was nothing l could do.

669
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,740
They took it from me.

670
01:18:24,118 --> 01:18:26,245
Save me, Angel.

671
01:18:28,164 --> 01:18:30,666
Thou b'ain't worth saving, Margaret.

672
01:18:32,002 --> 01:18:34,254
Let the dogs eat thee.

673
01:18:35,088 --> 01:18:37,132
Bye.

674
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:42,680
Angel!

675
01:19:28,857 --> 01:19:30,609
Here!

676
01:19:35,656 --> 01:19:38,785
- What is your name, woman?
- Get it off me!

677
01:19:38,868 --> 01:19:41,162
Who set traps for you?

678
01:19:41,246 --> 01:19:43,081
Pig!

679
01:19:43,164 --> 01:19:45,543
Why do you set the dogs on me?

680
01:19:46,752 --> 01:19:48,879
Bring her.

681
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:15,242
- Over there.
- (Margaret panting)

682
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,876
Bind her.

683
01:20:33,763 --> 01:20:36,600
Leave us, Ralph.

684
01:20:36,683 --> 01:20:38,727
(Margaret) Ralph!

685
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:47,487
l do not wish to hurt you.

686
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:50,449
But l will have the truth. Do you hear?

687
01:20:51,575 --> 01:20:53,494
l don't know what you mean.

688
01:20:53,577 --> 01:20:57,499
l have one mission here.
To destroy your practices.

689
01:20:57,582 --> 01:21:00,084
No consideration will prevent me.

690
01:21:01,419 --> 01:21:03,630
So speak.

691
01:21:05,382 --> 01:21:07,092
Never.

692
01:21:20,817 --> 01:21:24,904
- You'll do better than that.
- l didn't kill no one.

693
01:21:24,987 --> 01:21:28,617
Who will know,
when you're swinging from the gibbet?

694
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:33,622
Tell me, where is Angel Blake?

695
01:21:37,627 --> 01:21:40,088
You saw her in the woods.

696
01:21:42,507 --> 01:21:44,844
She was the one who trapped you.

697
01:21:48,722 --> 01:21:50,766
The bitch.

698
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:55,021
lf Angel has returned,
where does she meet her followers?

699
01:21:55,105 --> 01:21:57,107
Anywhere.

700
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:59,484
Where is your meeting place?

701
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,241
Anywhere.

702
01:22:05,324 --> 01:22:07,493
Anywhere that's hidden.

703
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:10,539
Tonight...

704
01:22:12,082 --> 01:22:14,126
No, no, tomorrow night. lt's past.

705
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:16,463
Tonight! Where?

706
01:22:16,546 --> 01:22:19,215
ln the old church, like before.

707
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:23,428
My master will take his form

708
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,099
and the last one will give a limb...

709
01:22:27,183 --> 01:22:30,060
And then... And then...

710
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:36,318
That is all l need to know.

711
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,368
You be too late.

712
01:22:45,495 --> 01:22:47,706
My master will be complete.

713
01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:50,876
He'll be too powerful for you!

714
01:22:53,212 --> 01:22:55,547
You don't have no chance.

715
01:24:46,172 --> 01:24:48,217
Ralph.

716
01:24:49,134 --> 01:24:51,553
Thou must not give me such frights.

717
01:24:52,095 --> 01:24:55,809
- What's wrong with thy leg?
- Nothing. Don't touch it.

718
01:24:55,892 --> 01:24:57,936
- Art thou alone?
- Yes.

719
01:24:58,019 --> 01:25:00,563
- There's no one else here?
- No. Why do thee ask?

720
01:25:00,647 --> 01:25:03,776
- Where's Mr Peter?
- Down the village with the rest of them.

721
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:08,989
Has thou not heard? The judge be
causing a great purge. Thou'lt be missed.

722
01:25:09,073 --> 01:25:11,492
They may come for me.

723
01:25:11,576 --> 01:25:15,705
What's wrong, Ralph?
We'd better go down the village.

724
01:25:22,088 --> 01:25:25,675
As thou loved Cathy,
don't breathe a word to no one.

725
01:25:25,758 --> 01:25:27,970
No, no. No.

726
01:25:28,637 --> 01:25:31,098
- No one goes to the spare room now?
- No.

727
01:25:32,182 --> 01:25:35,102
Ralph? Don't go up there!

728
01:25:40,692 --> 01:25:43,027
There's going to be a riot.

729
01:25:52,414 --> 01:25:54,666
Here we are. There we are.

730
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,878
Go on. Out.

731
01:26:00,506 --> 01:26:02,967
Three muskets. Are there no more?

732
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:06,095
- No, sir.
- Them guns ain't no use against the devil.

733
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:08,891
- Are you one of his clan?
- l, sir? No, to be sure.

734
01:26:08,974 --> 01:26:13,020
- My daughter's there, sir. Don't shoot her.
- Her daughter be a ruddy witch.

735
01:26:13,103 --> 01:26:15,482
We're to hang 'em all, every one of them.

736
01:26:15,565 --> 01:26:17,692
- What are we waiting for?
- Hold on!

737
01:26:23,616 --> 01:26:26,160
- lt's the judge.
- What are we waiting for?

738
01:26:27,953 --> 01:26:30,206
What are we waiting for?

739
01:26:57,862 --> 01:27:00,532
So we are ready.

740
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:06,956
My good friends, we go about
the most fearful business.

741
01:27:07,915 --> 01:27:14,005
Only the most strict discipline will save us
in our hour of trial.

742
01:27:15,632 --> 01:27:19,302
Let those who are not resolved
remain behind.

743
01:27:23,558 --> 01:27:25,685
Let us go.

744
01:27:55,677 --> 01:27:58,805
Ellen, what are them lights?

745
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:52,434
Sanctum fundamentum salve.

746
01:33:04,525 --> 01:33:07,111
Aah! Oh!
