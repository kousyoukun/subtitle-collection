1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,080
I think
everyone would love to just meet someone

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,000
in a bar or in a grocery store.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,200
But nowadays, the best way
you can meet someone is on a dating app.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,480
You can find
a bit of everything on Tinder.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,360
There are people looking for
long-term relationships or marriage.

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,600
People who just want to hook up.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,240
Anything.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,840
You can pick guys from all over the world.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,680
It's a lot of men.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,400
We are all looking for
that diamond in the rough.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,560
And of course, you Google everyone that
you're supposed to go on a date with.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,320
Well, this is gonna be fun.
Let's swipe right on that.

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,920
Private jets, cool cars,
amazing parties all over the world.

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,160
What happened to me felt like a movie.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
But in the movies,
there's always bad guys.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,760
I get these threatening messages.

17
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,960
These enemies were watching me, my family.

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,640
It's just been fucking hell.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,360
I'm shit scared.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Are they coming now? Did we lock the door?

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,680
I don't think I ever will be
the same again.

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,280
One little swipe
can change your life forever.

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,320
I think the... I think life is about love,

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
'cause the most happiest times I've had
is when I've been in love.

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,600
That's what's most amazing about love,
no matter how many heartbreaks you've had,

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
you still go after it.

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
I love dating.

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,240
The moment I get nervous, then I know
that there's something special here.

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
And I love being nervous.
That's the thing.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm after that all-consuming, the kind of...

31
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,480
What you've grown up with.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,160
The first memories
that I have about love is Disney.

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I had memorized the entire
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i> cassette.

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,760
I knew all the songs.

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,960
I just love Belle.

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,400
She is this small-town girl like me,
hoping for something bigger.

37
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,400
She meets this person,
and then she saves him in a sense,

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,120
or he saves her as well. Like,
to go into a different life together.

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,960
It just sticks with you, like, the feeling
of a prince coming to save you.

40
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,640
And I think that even though you know
it's not real, it's still with you a bit.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,160
I think everyone has
that little bit of hope deep down inside

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,440
it will be as magical
as they were portraying it to be.

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,320
But finding Prince Charming in real life...

44
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,960
It's a lot of work.

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,040
I've been on Tinder for seven years.

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm from Norway, but live in London.
So I've been on Tinder in two countries.

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
How many matches
have you had?

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,720
Do you really want to see?

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
- Can we see?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
1,024 matches.

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,400
Yeah, I'm a bit of a Tinder expert.
You can say that.

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,640
The most important thing that you can
have is a picture of your face,

53
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,600
then you have a picture with friends.

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,080
It's important to show
that you're social as well.

55
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,800
Feel my profile showing
I'm not in the hook-up culture.

56
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,200
Like, I'm after long-term love.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,080
For me to swipe right on a guy,

58
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,760
it needs to be
that we have some similar interests

59
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,280
in the pictures I'm looking at.

60
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,800
Maybe like a nice dinner somewhere,

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,920
or that you like the beach,
'cause I love a beach.

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh my God. Um, animals.

63
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,720
A handsome man with a cat?
Like, it can't go wrong.

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,320
And you want a guy that has ambition.

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,280
It's like Marilyn Monroe in the movie
<i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.</i>

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
And then she has this quote
where she says...

67
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,600
Don't you know that a man being rich
is like a girl being pretty?

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
You might not marry a girl
just because she's pretty,

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,200
but my goodness, doesn't it help?

70
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,920
It is a very true quote.
Like, you want the full package.

71
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,800
But it's not easy to find
what you're looking for.

72
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,160
It's a lot of swiping.
Back and forth, back and forth.

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,360
When I saw Simon's pictures,
he had the kind of look that I like.

74
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
He was dressed very stylish. I love a guy
in a suit, and he had several of those.

75
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,480
And he had his link to his Instagram.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
You always check the Insta.

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,320
He had so many pictures
and so many followers.

78
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,960
Business meetings, parties, beaches.

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,200
This guy is just having a very different
life than I ever will experience.

80
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,840
And I was just thinking that it would be
kind of cool just to meet up.

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
I decide to swipe right.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,120
And then he just responds fairly quickly.

83
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,320
"I'm leaving London tomorrow.
Do you want to meet up?"

84
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,720
When we text on WhatsApp,
he asked me to meet him

85
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,240
at the hotel that he was staying at,
the Four Seasons...

86
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,760
...and he just sent the Google Maps link,
so I could know where I was gonna go.

87
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,600
This was just going to be, like,
an hour-long coffee,

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,160
'cause I could just sense
that this guy was a busy guy.

89
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
When I walk into this really fancy hotel,
I feel out of place.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,200
I think I'm a bit early.
So I just decide to sit down and wait.

91
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
You know, you're nervous.

92
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,440
When the elevator door finally pings...

93
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,360
I was like, "Shit."

94
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,800
He looks exactly like his pictures.

95
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,600
He has this magnetism.

96
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,360
There's something about this guy
that is special.

97
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,320
One of the first topics
we talked about was his job.

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,200
He's the CEO of LLD Diamonds.

99
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,760
He got the job from his dad.

100
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
When he mentioned that his dad
was the king of diamonds,

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,400
so that meant that he was
the prince of diamonds,

102
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,920
I realized, like,
"My God, what kind of family is this?"

103
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,880
Very quickly, he'd become very personal.
And that's what I really liked about it.

104
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,640
He has a baby daughter
that turns two in a couple of weeks.

105
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,720
She's there now to visit him in London,

106
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
but he's not together with the mom
anymore.

107
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,200
He's rarely in one place
for a very long period of time,

108
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,640
and he just missed having someone,
you know.

109
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
When we were nearing the end of the date,

110
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,480
he said, "I really want
to get to know you better."

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
They were traveling to Bulgaria
for a business trip,

112
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
and then he was asking me
if I wanted to join them.

113
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
We're traveling by private jet.

114
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,480
"Shit. Ooh, this is something new
that I've never done before."

115
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,920
I felt that I would be stupid
if I said no.

116
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,120
So I was kind of, like,
super excited on the inside,

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,880
but on the outside, I kept it very cool,
because I was just thinking,

118
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,920
"Okay, you like this guy,
you just need to keep your cool now."

119
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,920
Simon asked one of his drivers
to take me back home,

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,600
so I could pack some stuff,
get my passport,

121
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
then they will drive me back.

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,400
Suddenly, there's this Rolls-Royce
waiting for me.

123
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,680
So I was kind of like,
"My God. This is insane."

124
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,680
It felt like being in a movie.

125
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,440
<i>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents</i>

126
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,320
<i>an exciting, extravagant,
romantic adventure.</i>

127
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,280
The Yellow Rolls-Royce.

128
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,040
I can be quick when I pack.

129
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,160
I have a messenger group
with my girlfriends.

130
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,640
My friends are freaking out.

131
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,880
"Who is this guy? How do you know him?
You can be abducted."

132
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,080
I was like, "Oh, I didn't even think
about that. I'm on a date, you know."

133
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
At the airport, there is the entire team
waiting for us.

134
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,040
A really tall guy,
which I presume is the bodyguard.

135
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,720
There's a couple of drivers,
and you have his little daughter.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
I see this woman
that's with Simon's daughter.

137
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
Simon tells me that
that's the baby's mother

138
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,560
and that they're going to be
on the plane with us.

139
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,920
His ex is joining us
on our first date together,

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,840
and I'm kind of like,
"Well, this can be interesting."

141
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,600
Morning. How are you?
Ah, good. Morning.

142
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,880
Did you take videos
on the plane? Show me?

143
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,560
Yes. It's like the worst person.

144
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,680
That's what one of my friends would say.

145
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,000
"Can you stop being so awkward?"
But I was very excited about it, you know.

146
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,520
It was champagne with caviar.
I've never eaten caviar before.

147
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,520
And then it was sushi. And it was like
it was a totally different world.

148
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,640
If I like someone, I'll give them
a little kiss on the cheek.

149
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,720
It was quick,
but it just felt very natural.

150
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,600
When we landed, me and the baby's mother
and the baby, we went into a car.

151
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
Of course, I take the opportunity
to ask some questions.

152
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,520
She tells me
what a wonderful father he is,

153
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,880
that he's still supporting them
even though they're not together anymore,

154
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,320
which was really, really nice to hear.

155
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
When we go to the hotel, we check in,

156
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,040
and when we're walking
into the elevator together,

157
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,560
exactly when the door closes,

158
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,960
he takes me around the waist
and he just looks at me

159
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,280
and he draws me in
and just gives me this kiss,

160
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,160
and I was like, "Oh, shit," you know,
the kind of butterflies...

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,160
It was passionate,
and was just the perfect first kiss

162
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,520
that you could have, you know.

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,760
- You sleep together?
- We sleep together.

164
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,280
And then, later on, I could see
that he has some marks on his back.

165
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,040
I was just wondering, like, what is this?
Where, like, I was touching it.

166
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
And then he was kind of like, "Oh, well..."

167
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,920
He didn't exactly know how to say it,
but it was, like,

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,960
he had been in jail in South Africa.
And I was like, "What?"

169
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
Just trust me once more.

170
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,600
Why should I?

171
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
He had a deal going on there, and they had

172
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,520
turned their backs against him
and betrayed him.

173
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,920
So he had gone in prison
on false pretenses.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He was innocent.

175
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,680
He had been manhandled in prison
because he was Jewish.

176
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,720
Here was this guy I thought
had everything going for him

177
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
sitting on the bed with me,
being really vulnerable.

178
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,000
Just give me the stamps.

179
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,960
Oh. Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter...

180
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
Here's this kind of person
that you want to save,

181
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,680
especially 'cause he has
so much responsibility on his back.

182
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,360
Everyone is relying on him.

183
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,880
Even though things had gone
very quickly with us,

184
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,120
but when I sit there and I feel
an emotional connection with someone

185
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,360
and they're opening up,
that's just how I am as a person.

186
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,720
He starts getting a lot of calls,
and, in the end, he just says,

187
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,320
"We're so busy. I think it's best
if you just go back home."

188
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,000
I was a bit disappointed, actually.
I was kind of like...

189
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,360
I wanted to spend more time with him.

190
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,760
When I came back to London, I thought
the conversation would die out.

191
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,480
I didn't expect anything.

192
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,880
I felt like I knew him more,
but I didn't really "know him" know him.

193
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,920
Like, how special was I? I felt special,
but, like, when he leaves, you never know.

194
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,080
I was hoping. I was really hoping

195
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,840
that he was gonna come back.

196
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,600
But then kept going with, like,
good morning messages to each other

197
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
and good night messages, and FaceTime.

198
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,520
He was, like, tagging me
where he was going.

199
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,760
When I was at work, you could hear
the pinging in your phone,

200
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,760
and it was, like, "I hope that it's him."

201
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,320
He just suddenly asked me,
"So what's your address?"

202
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
Never, ever received a bouquet like that.

203
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,960
<i>Miss you. Wanna spend some time
together... Kiss you, hug you.</i>

204
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,040
Feel like we have something special,
and he says so to me.

205
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,000
So I'm kind of like,
"Oh, shit. Is this it?"

206
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,560
Ah, it was so nice seeing him again.

207
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,120
I can't even describe to someone.
Like, when you really want to see someone.

208
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,680
Just feeling that you're his girl
is like the best feeling.

209
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,880
But then it was difficult to meet up with
him. He was traveling a lot for business.

210
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,360
I was going home to Oslo
and I was thinking,

211
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,880
"Well, you can come to Oslo!"

212
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,360
And that was one of the things he said,

213
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,920
"But, babe, I don't have anything to do
in Oslo. There's no business,"

214
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and I was missing him so much, I was like,
"I'm never gonna be able to see you."

215
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,280
You're kidding me.

216
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,000
You're such a busy guy,
and you decide to take a private jet

217
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,800
and land at like 3:00 a.m.
to come and see me.

218
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,000
So I go to his hotel. I bought him,
like, a Valentine's present.

219
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,520
It was a book about
having a relationship with a Norwegian.

220
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,000
And then I had made,
like, ten things about him

221
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,360
that makes him wonderful,
which I'd written myself.

222
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,280
And then he just asked me,

223
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,280
"I am serious about you.
Do you want to be my girlfriend?"

224
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,800
And I'm kind of like, "Oh, shit."
The kind of words that you wanted to hear.

225
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah. And then we were together.

226
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
That's when he said there was something
he wants to tell me

227
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
if we're gonna be together.

228
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,520
It was better to be open and honest
about how his life was

229
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,000
than to keep it hidden.

230
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,560
He was just talking about
this big deal that he needed to get done,

231
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,800
and the deal was worth $70 million,

232
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,480
but the diamond industry
is a dangerous business.

233
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,160
He had these threats
surrounding his security.

234
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,720
He had a security team in Israel.
Peter was like the head of it.

235
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
Threats had gotten worse.

236
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,440
He showed me pictures of, like,
they had gotten bullets in the mail.

237
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,320
Funeral flowers had been sent.

238
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,560
He had CCTV of an apartment in Tel Aviv.

239
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,080
He had a break-in there.

240
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,480
The security team told him
that he wasn't safe in London anymore,

241
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,960
and for time being he needed to stay away.

242
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,800
Of course, I get super scared for him.

243
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,640
I could just see
that it was straining on him.

244
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,400
He just wanted my understanding
that things were gonna be fine,

245
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,000
and we were going to be together.

246
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
And I was like,
"Okay. I'll be here for you."

247
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,320
When I got back home, one of my friends
Googled the Leviev family.

248
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,280
She says this is
one of the most powerful families.

249
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
They've become big for a reason.

250
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Need to be realistic
about what he's involved in.

251
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,920
I hadn't seen him in a while.
And of course it made you a bit scared.

252
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,160
So I check his Tinder to see where he is.

253
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,440
I see that he's in a different country.

254
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
And I also see
a couple of his pictures had changed.

255
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,600
My heart just sank, you know,
'cause that means that he's been active.

256
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,040
So what's going on?

257
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,760
<i>I'm not using Tinder anymore.
I deleted the app. I deleted the account.</i>

258
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,600
He tells me that we're a team
and we're together

259
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,840
and that I have nothing to worry about.

260
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,400
There's no one else. Only me.

261
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,560
<i>I care about you. I miss you.
And everything will be all right, baby.</i>

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,320
I was sitting by my phone,
swiping, swiping.

263
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,000
What kind of guy
were you hoping for?

264
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,000
An ideal guy. A smart one. And funny.
And very impulsive.

265
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm a very independent woman.
I always have been.

266
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,840
I've done that since the age of 16,

267
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,640
so I don't need a man to take care of me,

268
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,920
but I would appreciate
to have a man to share my life.

269
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,560
My Tinder profile was a mix.

270
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,520
It had some pictures
with me dressed for work, traveling,

271
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,840
because I still wanted
to attract this person

272
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,720
that was living the same life as I did.

273
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,120
So I was swiping.
And then this guy comes up.

274
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,040
This is someone who is well-traveled.

275
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,400
And still works very hard.

276
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,360
So I thought,
"Oh, great. Let's swipe right on that."

277
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
I got a match.

278
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,240
He was here in Stockholm for business,
but it said he was living in Amsterdam.

279
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,240
He texts me and asks me
if I want to come visit.

280
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,200
<i>There is a flight
tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning</i>

281
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,760
<i>from Stockholm to Amsterdam.</i>

282
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,560
<i>So tell me if it's all right for you.</i>

283
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,200
He asked about my passport details,
booked my flight ticket,

284
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,000
which I thought was a nice gesture.

285
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,040
I get this confirmation
from Simon Leviev at LLD Diamonds.

286
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Of course, I started to Google,

287
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,360
because you always Google everyone
you're supposed to go on a date with.

288
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,440
His father is this diamond tycoon,

289
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,280
and I'm just thinking,
"Oh my God, another diamond guy."

290
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,920
- Um...
- Another diamond guy?

291
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

292
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,880
I used to date a guy
that was in the diamond industry.

293
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,760
Okay, maybe second time around.

294
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,320
I take a car to his house, which is
in this lovely, lovely neighborhood.

295
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
He comes and opens up the door.

296
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,760
He dresses very elegantly.

297
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,120
"A little bit short for my taste,"
was the first thing I was thinking,

298
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,360
but he's really easy to talk to.

299
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,960
It's quite rare that you meet someone
and you have this instant connection.

300
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,560
After we spent an hour together,

301
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,240
we felt like we had known each other
for ten years or something.

302
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,800
We go for lunch,
the entire staff welcomes us.

303
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,880
They bring a special order of caviar
that the restaurant uses just for Simon.

304
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,760
I don't think the food
ever stopped coming in.

305
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,160
He really asked a lot of questions,
really wanted to listen,

306
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,800
which I really appreciated.

307
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,600
'Cause it's quite rare
to have men listen sometimes.

308
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,040
Afterwards, we had a nice, long walk
around Amsterdam. I see a diamond museum.

309
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,040
I love museums,
and if you should go to a diamond museum,

310
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
you should go
with someone in the business.

311
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,200
He knows all about the mines,

312
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,600
how to cut them,
where you get the best diamonds.

313
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,360
He knows everything.

314
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,200
After that,
he makes this little bit of a move on me.

315
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,160
But it just doesn't feel right.

316
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,720
He's like, "No, maybe no.
Just... Better just stay friends."

317
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,560
"Yeah, maybe you're right."

318
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,880
Even though there wasn't
a romantic energy between us,

319
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,560
I really enjoyed myself.

320
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,680
I actually missed him after just a day
or two, because we did have a lot of fun.

321
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,400
We were talking and calling and texting.

322
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
When he's out to dinner,

323
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,520
he sends me a picture,
and we used voice notes.

324
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,160
<i>Beautiful looking.
Beautiful, Pernilla.</i>

325
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Happy to see you tomorrow.

326
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,360
You can be two different types
of personalities sometimes.

327
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,640
So either you can be a battery charger
or a battery drainer.

328
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,520
<i>Work hard, play hard.</i>

329
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,640
And he was definitely my battery charger.

330
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,120
<i>Amazing. Amazing. Beautiful dress.</i>

331
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,400
Once, I remember, like, he flew over
just to have a coffee with me one day

332
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
because I was having a bad day.

333
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,720
<i>Pernilla, about 10 o'clock
we're going for a drink.</i>

334
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,480
<i>Then, 12:30, we're going to the club.</i>

335
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,280
<i>Can't wait to see you later!</i>

336
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,000
I gave him a little bit of a prince emoji
next to his name,

337
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,000
because that's how he's behaving
sometimes.

338
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,880
And I always make a joke about this.

339
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,120
Really felt like we had
a special connection.

340
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

341
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,560
<i>I love you with all my heart.
I miss you so much.</i>

342
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,600
Simon was away a lot
on business.

343
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,040
We'd talk and text every single day.

344
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,200
Your girl is finally done with yoga
for the night.

345
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,520
And she's at home
making some delicious salmon.

346
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,680
I felt special.

347
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,200
It was just amazing.

348
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,360
And then, he asked me.

349
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,920
It's just the best feeling, you know,
when you have someone

350
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,440
and both are on the same wavelength.

351
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Time for apartment number two.

352
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,520
Living room where we can
watch movies and stuff.

353
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,880
I was dreaming of how it would be
for the two of us to live together.

354
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,280
And then you have this awesome kitchen.

355
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,760
And here is the bedroom.

356
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,720
Simon tells me that
the budget is $15,000 per month.

357
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Third apartment.

358
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,600
So I'm going all the rounds
in these amazing apartments.

359
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,760
And sometimes I even have
Simon with me on FaceTime.

360
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,240
It was just a really nice way
to connect with him,

361
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,040
even though he wasn't there,
to do it together.

362
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,680
The view is out to the Piazza
at Covent Garden.

363
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,120
Cecilie, my love, I love you, I miss you.
I can't wait to see you.

364
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,240
In the middle of the night, I get
a picture of Peter, Simon's bodyguard.

365
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,760
Simon is writing "Peter hurt,"
and I'm like, "What the fuck?"

366
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,160
Well, this is the night.

367
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,800
Can you write your first name?
Or I can write it, of course.

368
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,960
We're in an ambulance.

369
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,120
Can you write that?

370
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,920
He just says that, "They were
going after me. Thank God for Peter."

371
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
"If not, I would be dead."

372
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,200
<i>It's okay, love. It's okay.</i>

373
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,400
<i>I told you, we're in a war.
We need to be strong.</i>

374
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,640
I didn't know what to do.
And he just says, "We're safe now."

375
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,120
"We're being taken care of.
You just need to sleep."

376
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,280
The next morning,
Simon sends me a voice note.

377
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,680
<i>Because of the situation,
with the security and everything,</i>

378
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,160
<i>they told me I'm not allowed
to use my credit card.</i>

379
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,720
He can't use his cards anymore because
the security team has said his enemies

380
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,480
are tracing his spending and where he is
based on his credit card use.

381
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
<i>I wanted to ask you a favor.</i>

382
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,800
<i>If you have
an American Express credit card,</i>

383
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,720
<i>I can link it to my account.</i>

384
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,480
He was just wondering
if he could use my cards for some time.

385
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,720
It would just help him a lot.

386
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,880
<i>It's just temporary,
like, for, uh,</i>

387
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
<i>two weeks or something.</i>

388
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm his girlfriend.

389
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,200
Of course he would ask me.
Like, you trust me and I trust you,

390
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,880
so of course we're gonna help each other.
It wasn't even a question.

391
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,920
The Platinum Amex is in my name, and he
starts using it as he said he would,

392
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,440
but he maxes out quite quickly.

393
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,720
So he makes payment directly to Amex,
and I get the receipt from him,

394
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,280
and he says that the money is on the way,
but in the meantime,

395
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,640
he wants me to come to Amsterdam
and bring some cash to him. $25,000.

396
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,280
How on Earth am I going to
get that amount of cash?

397
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,560
I took out a loan,
which I then took out in cash.

398
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,720
I was super scared
having that amount of cash in my bag.

399
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,320
Especially when we went through security.

400
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,080
I was super stressed.

401
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,000
How was I gonna explain the money
if I got any questions about it?

402
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,240
The moment I'm with him, I feel safe.
My biggest issue was being apart from him.

403
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,040
He was really grateful.

404
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,520
He told me that everything I was doing
is keeping him safe.

405
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,600
But within hours, the security team
said there was a problem.

406
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,840
He deletes his Instagram
because of security measures,

407
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,440
and then he asked me
to make my account private.

408
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,080
Take it all away.

409
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,080
He says that they can come
and get me through him.

410
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,360
Of course, I get paranoid.
What the fuck is going on?

411
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,240
Later on, Simon gets a call.

412
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,160
He puts Peter on the speakerphone,
and he says,

413
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,160
"Simon, there's been a security breach.
They know where you are."

414
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,840
"The plane is ready to leave.
I can't tell you where you're going."

415
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,920
Peter is asking if he can please
turn off the lights in the apartment.

416
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,320
I'm shit scared. Are they coming now?
Did we lock the door?

417
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,240
Just seeing someone
that you care so much for in danger,

418
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,320
and, like, you can see that
he was not doing well mentally.

419
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,480
I could see
that he was struggling so much.

420
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,040
And in the end,
he just told me that he had to go.

421
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,320
When he lands, he sends me the geotag.
He's landed in Stockholm.

422
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,160
He is here. Very spontaneous.

423
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,560
So I ask him...

424
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,160
The club is basically an ocean with women,

425
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,880
or as I call them, champagne girls.

426
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,440
They are basically like flies.

427
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,160
Like, you put out a rotten banana,
and they just attack,

428
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,720
but these girls do the same thing
when they see a bottle of champagne.

429
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,600
And Simon is of course
paying for this entire circus.

430
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,120
He's paying with cash and just making sure
that everyone is having a good time.

431
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,720
All of them are quite drunk,
especially Simon's bodyguard, Peter.

432
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,880
This is not an environment
that I want to be in.

433
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,320
So I just stay for 10, 15 minutes
and then just say,

434
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,920
"Let's talk tomorrow
and enjoy your night and have fun."

435
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,840
The morning after, I text him
and ask how the hangover is

436
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,800
and maybe if he needs a cup of coffee,
we should go for one,

437
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,760
and then he texts me back.

438
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,400
He's already in Spain.

439
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,160
The Amex card is in my name.

440
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,120
<i>Welcome to American Express.</i>

441
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,400
So I had to pretend that I was the one
traveling around, you know.

442
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,680
<i>I understand your card isn't working.</i>

443
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,000
<i>I'll connect you with someone
who can assist. Say or enter...</i>

444
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,760
I needed to know exactly the amount that
he was spending, which hotel he was in,

445
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,720
so they would believe
that I was the one using the card.

446
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,120
<i>We need to go. We need to travel.</i>

447
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,680
<i>It's making things
very complicated, honey.</i>

448
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,320
Couple of hours later he would call again,
and it's blocked again.

449
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,360
<i>Welcome to American Express.</i>

450
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,880
Then I need to call Amex,

451
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,560
and Simon had already told me
that this would happen,

452
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,800
that it would be something
that I would need to do at the start

453
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
to call them and fix this.

454
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,480
The other problem
was that the credit limit wasn't enough.

455
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,680
We had to get it up so he could spend it,
'cause he had an entire team, you know.

456
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,240
So I was like,
"Okay, but how are you going to do that?"

457
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,880
He said, "Well, I can employ you."

458
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,520
He then calls someone in LLD Diamonds
and asks for my passport details,

459
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,520
so I can be put
into the employment registry.

460
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,760
I just tried to say,
"Well, I am not really working there."

461
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,120
He's like, "Well, you are. I'm the CEO.
If they call, you are employed."

462
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,200
<i>I would never ask you for anything
if it was not serious shit.</i>

463
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,880
<i>All these security issues,</i>

464
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,520
<i>you've always been there for me,
so thank you, my love.</i>

465
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,760
We were in a crisis at this point.
Like, what else are we gonna do?

466
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,440
So then I got employed. I got pay slips.

467
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,120
- How much?
- Earning so much.

468
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,360
I think it was, like, $94,000 per month.

469
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,280
I send this over
to prove that I earn much more.

470
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,840
That makes them
raise the credit limit like this.

471
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,880
Of course, you are a bit worried,

472
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,960
but he sends me
a receipt from Credit Suisse

473
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,200
where he's making a transfer
directly to me.

474
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,160
It's for $250,000.

475
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,520
It's more than enough to pay
for the amount that he was spending.

476
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,960
Mykonos is like
a perfect playground.

477
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,240
You will see a lot of yachts,
a lot of celebrities, a lot of models.

478
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,280
You pack all your bikinis, definitely,
for the daytime parties as well.

479
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,200
I am on the phone with Simon,

480
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,480
and he tells me
he has just met his new girlfriend.

481
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Polina.

482
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,920
I tell him they should meet us in Mykonos,
and he does.

483
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,640
I was going to Oslo.
To see my friends, see my family.

484
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,840
And I really wanted to introduce him.

485
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,560
I'm just waiting for him.
He said he was gonna come the next day.

486
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
I meet Polina
for the first time.

487
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,480
She's this typical, like, Russian model.
Quite young. But she's very down to earth.

488
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,920
And I really liked her.

489
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,680
He seems very smitten over her.
They seemed like a good match.

490
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,440
<i>Look, I cannot come right now.
I cannot.</i>

491
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,320
The security team had told him,
"You need to stay away."

492
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,160
I felt deeply disappointed.

493
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,840
But what's most important
is actually to keep him safe.

494
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,720
Of course
he had booked the grand suite,

495
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,360
with own private pool.

496
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,480
It's about $5,000 a night, this room.
It's absolutely gorgeous.

497
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
<i>I know
you hate to ring up the bank,</i>

498
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
<i>but sometimes it is necessary.</i>

499
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,120
<i>I need to book some tickets
for the rest of the team.</i>

500
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,760
Suddenly need to get
so much money for this entire team

501
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,600
that is traveling business class,
that is having expensive dinners.

502
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,440
Like, they're going out with clients,
and the spend is to another level

503
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,000
that you have never, ever seen before.

504
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,800
<i>This is what I do all the time.
Just meetings and more meetings.</i>

505
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,800
$20,000 is a lot of money,
and that was spent in three days.

506
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,880
Simon asks, "Where should we go now?"

507
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,200
We decide to go to Bonbonniere,
also known as the billionaire's club.

508
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,280
You don't get in here
without paying for a table,

509
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,520
which is normally $2,000.

510
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,400
For people here, this is peanuts for them.
This is coffee money.

511
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,200
He maxes out
the credit card again.

512
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,560
So he told me to get more loans.

513
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,120
<i>Don't worry,
I will finish this deal.</i>

514
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,600
<i>Champagne's on me.</i>

515
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,040
Simon orders in
a couple of bottles of champagne.

516
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,800
Before we even have time
to try and chip in,

517
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,840
he has already paid for the bill.

518
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,920
Simon is very generous.

519
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,600
I take out a loan for $40,000.

520
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,280
Simon and Polina
were continuing their little summer tour.

521
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,840
<i>I tried to do,
like, another transaction,</i>

522
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,720
<i>and it didn't go through.</i>

523
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,840
Every second or third day
is a new request.

524
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,440
France, and then they were going Vienna.
They were going Switzerland.

525
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,920
<i>Almost there.
I'm 97% done with the deals.</i>

526
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
Each time he maxes out the card,
I have to take out a new loan.

527
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,760
$50,000 Instabank. $12,500 DNB.
$10,000 for a credit card.

528
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,640
"Let's meet up in Rome.
We need to go and see the Coliseum."

529
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,520
Hello.

530
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
Hello.

531
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,640
This amazing
Rolls-Royce Phantom

532
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,400
is taking us around all the famous sites,

533
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,920
like the Spanish Stairs, the Coliseum,

534
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,600
the Trevi Fountain to throw a few pennies.

535
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,400
I definitely need some more luck in my
life. Let's see if this can sort it out.

536
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,240
<i>Check what is going on
with the card.</i>

537
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,480
<i>Now. It's important.</i>

538
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,680
Money he had promised me
still hasn't come into my account.

539
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,880
<i>I've already done it
so it doesn't matter right now.</i>

540
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,880
<i>We need a solution right now
for the current situation.</i>

541
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,520
It's kind of like a pressure
that I have never experienced before

542
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,560
to have someone's life
depending on what you're doing.

543
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,360
<i>You know,
I'm facing security threats</i>

544
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,400
<i>with people trying to kill me.</i>

545
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,040
If he couldn't use the card, if something
went wrong, he could be in danger.

546
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,760
And if I didn't help him,
what might happen?

547
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Morning.

548
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,880
<i>The things you're doing for me,
the things we're going through together,</i>

549
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,840
<i>it's for life.</i>

550
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,640
<i>This is what is making me see
that you are the one.</i>

551
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,480
$20,000, Monobank. $15,000, Nordea.

552
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,680
We all give each other
a big hug

553
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,080
and say that we should meet again soon,

554
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,160
after just like an amazing summer, really.

555
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,680
How much had you taken?

556
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,680
$250,000. That's not what I signed up for.

557
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,400
- A lot.
- It is a lot of money.

558
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,800
<i>I know
you have done, uh, too much,</i>

559
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,520
<i>for me, for us, for everything.</i>

560
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,920
<i>I know you're tired
and you want to be together,</i>

561
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,680
<i>which, of course, I do want as well.</i>

562
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,720
<i>I understand.
Everything will be all right.</i>

563
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:50,040
I was getting so tired and annoyed
and I just needed some kind of money.

564
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,640
That's when he says, "You can come
to Amsterdam and I can give you a check."

565
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,240
He seemed colder.
Wasn't the same kind of affection.

566
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,440
There was almost a cloud across his eyes
that I couldn't pierce through.

567
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,680
When we get into the apartment,
the check is already there.

568
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,520
The check is worth much more
than the debt I have now.

569
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:34,040
We're trying to be together.
But I can just feel a distance.

570
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,360
It wasn't a good night.

571
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,960
The first thing I do when I come back
from Amsterdam is cash this check.

572
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,600
I really needed that check to go through.

573
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,480
I had eight, nine creditors, you know.

574
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,200
That's a lot of emails
coming down on you at the same time.

575
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,120
I check my bank account every single day.

576
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,280
When four days have passed,
I just know that I need to call the bank.

577
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,200
<i>How can I help you today?</i>

578
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,680
She says, "We won't cash it."

579
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,480
And she couldn't tell me why.

580
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,320
And that's when I was just standing
on the phone, like,

581
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,480
feeling that I had hard to breathe.

582
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,416
<i>Cecilie, I don't understand.
We have...</i>

583
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,000
I was asking about the check,
like, "It didn't work."

584
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,000
He says, "Well, fuck it.
I gave you the money, so..."

585
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,920
"I did my deal."

586
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,080
<i>I already done it.</i>

587
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,400
Never hear him so cold
in my life.

588
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,520
It was like that person on the phone
was no longer my boyfriend.

589
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,680
Was no longer my boyfriend.

590
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,040
I... It was just a, uh... just a darkness.

591
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,880
I know I was in deep shit.

592
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,440
Like, what do you do
when you have nine creditors on you?

593
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,440
I called the Amex helpline.

594
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,520
They can hear how stressed I am.

595
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,880
They just said,
"Stay put. We will come to you."

596
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,840
I was shit scared
they were gonna come and handcuff me

597
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
and take me away.

598
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,600
The documents that I sent over.

599
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,480
The lies I told on the phone.

600
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,400
I gave him my card.

601
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,320
I tell them everything.

602
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,440
They said, "Do you have a picture of him?"

603
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,840
That moment when they look at each other
and they say that's the guy.

604
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,680
Fuck. Shit. You know?

605
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,320
"What kind of name did he use?"
And then I said Simon Leviev.

606
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,680
And they said, "Well, that's
one of many names that he's been using."

607
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,560
"Many names"?

608
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,520
Who is this guy
I've been sharing the same bed with?

609
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,000
"He's a professional.
He does this for a living."

610
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,800
Everything's a lie.

611
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,040
He's not a prince of diamonds.
He's not the son of a billionaire.

612
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,840
The man I loved was never real.

613
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,680
He faked everything.

614
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,160
It was horrible, you know.

615
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,040
'Cause I still...

616
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,920
In a sense, I still loved him, you know?

617
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,280
Or the person I thought that he was.
Like, you know everything is a lie,

618
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,280
but then you still have this fairy tale
that's going on, on your phone.

619
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,320
Simon, with still the heart behind it,
'cause I couldn't remove it.

620
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,800
'Cause I still wanted him to be true.

621
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,240
I don't understand
how someone can be so fucking evil.

622
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,920
I felt that he knew me.

623
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,800
The minute they're gone,
I want to speak to my mom.

624
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,560
She just told me,
"You need to get back home to Norway."

625
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,080
"I need you to be with me."

626
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,680
I was going through the messages
in the text.

627
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,960
I was still asking,
"When are we going to fix the money?"

628
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,880
The last messages between the two of us
is like, "I'm working on it."

629
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,200
And then I blocked him.

630
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,840
There was nothing else to say.

631
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,240
That's when I remember
he has my mom's number.

632
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,040
<i>Hey, you blocked me,
I don't know what is your reason.</i>

633
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,120
<i>I'm trying to reach you.
You don't want to talk anyway.</i>

634
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,560
<i>I want to tell you something.
Take my advice.</i>

635
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,160
<i>Just watch out.</i>

636
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,520
<i>Because with every action
there will be a reaction.</i>

637
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,560
I got super scared.

638
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,920
But my mom got even more scared.

639
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,320
We call the police in Norway,
because he knows everything about me.

640
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,960
He has all my passport details, where I
was living, where my mom is living.

641
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,200
He's spoken to her on the phone.
He knows where I am.

642
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,480
But the police didn't seem to care.

643
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,000
I don't know what he is capable of.

644
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,720
I've been on the edge for several days.

645
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,120
I had all these creditors.
I had to let them know, each one of them.

646
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,560
It wasn't just two banks.
There were, like, nine of them.

647
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,920
For this kind of loan, the interest is so
high, that they would just eat me alive.

648
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,360
I felt that I was just drowning.

649
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,040
It was like someone was
just dragging me to the bottom.

650
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,720
I was driving down this road,
and I saw a trailer coming towards me,

651
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,920
and I was thinking...

652
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,400
"What if I just
take the car over," you know?

653
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,880
- And just hit...
- just hit the trailer, you know?

654
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,640
Then at least it's done, you know?
And that's when I got scared.

655
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,440
That's when I got really scared.

656
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,800
I put myself into a psychiatric ward
because I didn't know what to do.

657
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,280
I was at home, and I could see
the phone started flashing.

658
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,200
I see it's Simon,
and he has sent me news articles.

659
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,120
Simon's father is gonna be
questioned by the police

660
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,360
in a big diamond smuggling case.

661
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,200
Members of Simon's family
have gotten arrested. Russia is involved.

662
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,840
I give him a call.

663
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,080
<i>That sounds really scary...</i>

664
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,440
He sounds all over the place.

665
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,800
He says police went in. They have
shut down all accounts, all credit cards.

666
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,800
One girl in the office literally jumped
from the building and killed herself.

667
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,240
But Simon says he doesn't believe
that this lady jumped off a building.

668
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,160
He believes that someone went in
and threw her out.

669
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,720
<i>We don't have the options,
you know, the...</i>

670
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,480
And I'm getting so scared.
I'm like, "What is really going on?"

671
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,840
And he says that the security situation
right now is really bad.

672
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,520
<i>I have the worst night in my life.</i>

673
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,200
A few days later,
I can feel my phone buzzing.

674
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,640
Simon is sending a lot of messages.

675
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,040
<i>Oh, my God, what happened last night?</i>

676
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,640
<i>Someone tried to stab me, and</i>

677
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,520
<i>so Peter broke his hand.</i>

678
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,680
<i>Jesus.
What do you mean tried to stab you?</i>

679
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,120
<i>What is going on?</i>

680
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,760
Simon said,
"This is my enemies behind this."

681
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,440
He was really concerned
that someone was after him.

682
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,800
And then I get a voice note from him.

683
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,200
<i>I want to ask you, uh, a favor.</i>

684
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,160
"Pernilla, I am really embarrassed
to even ask you."

685
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,760
"Would it be possible
for me to borrow $30,000?"

686
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,840
<i>It would be a huge, huge, huge,
huge, huge, huge help.</i>

687
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,800
<i>Please let me know if you can
do something. Thank you so much.</i>

688
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,120
I didn't have $30,000 to spare.

689
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,400
I'd been at my mom's now for three months.

690
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,080
I had my savings

691
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,280
that was gonna go to buy myself a new
apartment where I'm supposed to live.

692
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,160
But, what is more important,

693
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,920
my friend's security situation
or me buying an apartment?

694
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,016
<i>Thank you
for everything you've done...</i>

695
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,920
And I make a bank transfer
while I'm on the phone with him.

696
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,760
He's really grateful to have such a good
friend as me that he really can trust.

697
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,040
I was laying in bed
at the psychiatric ward, on my phone,

698
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,720
going through more details
with the people that I had met.

699
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,880
I knew that Simon was lying.
But what about the others?

700
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,880
Peter, the bodyguard.

701
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,160
If it wasn't real,
then did he lie to me as well?

702
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,000
Who is the woman with the kid?

703
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,000
Was that Simon's daughter?

704
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,760
I write a message to Amex.

705
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,720
Can you give me some more information?

706
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,200
They tell me to Google Shimon Hayut
and that I will find some answers.

707
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,880
There's an article in Finnish.

708
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,760
So I go into Google Translate.

709
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,400
Israeli multi-millionaire
that cheated on women.

710
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,680
What the fuck?

711
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,360
Back in 2015, he had been defrauding
three Finnish women.

712
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,480
They don't give names. They are protected.

713
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,960
He was saying that he was in the weapons
industry to one of the women.

714
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,080
To another woman,
he said he was a Mossad agent.

715
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,560
That's insane. He goes to prison.
He becomes even worse.

716
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,800
They let out a guy that has almost been,
like, cooking up a new plan.

717
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,480
You knew he would
just continue, continue, continue.

718
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,640
Who's gonna stop him?

719
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,640
I had to stop him.

720
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,240
I needed to go to the biggest newspaper
in Norway, VG.

721
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,920
I was just praying, you know,
that they would take this on.

722
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,840
This was really like
an unbelievable story.

723
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,360
A guy who had pretended to be
a son of a diamond billionaire.

724
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,800
Private jets, a luxury lifestyle. It, uh,
sounds almost like a fairy tale or movie.

725
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,920
First thing you ask
as a journalist is

726
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,720
what kind of documentation
can you share with us?

727
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,120
You can't print it without documentation.

728
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,520
Of course, I have WhatsApp.

729
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,760
I then imagine strangers reading through
my inner thoughts, my fears,

730
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,920
my love for this guy, you know?

731
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,600
It's super private. It's selfies in bed.

732
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,400
But the evidence came first,
and I just sent it over.

733
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,640
It was almost 400 pages of text.

734
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,720
There's video.

735
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,560
Pictures.

736
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,080
<i>Okay, baby. I'm taking off now.</i>

737
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,760
Audio messages.

738
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,760
It's astounding.

739
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,040
It's like looking
into the anatomy of the relationship.

740
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,640
We can follow how this developed
minute by minute.

741
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,280
He's extremely professional
in what he does.

742
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,800
The first date was a good way

743
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,120
to lure her to believe
that he was really successful.

744
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,880
This is an emotional con.

745
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,440
He was promising so much...

746
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,600
an apartment together,

747
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,040
vacations,

748
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,120
building a family together.

749
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,320
<i>I wanted to ask you a favor.</i>

750
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,360
The first request for money

751
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,240
comes after
they've been dating for over a month.

752
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:06,000
And he has been using that month
to make her fall in love with him,

753
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:12,160
prove that he is really rich,
and make her afraid of his enemies.

754
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,360
There's no reason to believe
that Simon is not able to pay her back,

755
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,120
because she has seen how wealthy he is.

756
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,320
Simon is surrounded
by a lot of people,

757
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,400
especially his bodyguard
and his business partner.

758
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:33,440
We don't know who is working with Simon
and how far this conspiracy actually goes.

759
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,200
Cecilie was also sending us
this Finnish article.

760
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,480
Is Shimon Hayut and Simon Leviev
the same guy?

761
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,080
We all got in touch
with the authorities

762
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,640
and found out the names
of the three Finnish women.

763
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:02,000
I ask Cecilie, does she recognize
the victims' names?

764
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,560
I Google these women.

765
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,840
I don't recognize anyone.

766
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,400
And then a face pops up
that is very familiar.

767
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,280
It's the same woman
that was on the jet with me.

768
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,200
The same woman
that has a child with Simon.

769
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,240
How on the fucking Earth
were you a victim?

770
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,280
You were standing at the trial
back in 2016.

771
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,240
Putting him to jail,

772
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,800
knowing that he had lied to you,

773
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,480
and suddenly, three years later, you're
sitting on a private jet with Simon.

774
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,920
The things that she told me in that car

775
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,760
made me really believe
that he was a great guy.

776
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,960
Why didn't she warn me?

777
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,640
That was extraordinary,

778
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,280
and it made it hard
because we didn't know who to trust.

779
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,920
But we still had to prove to the police
that Shimon Yehuda Hayut and Simon Leviev

780
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,280
was the same person.

781
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,440
In the indictment,
we have his date of birth.

782
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,080
So when we typed in
"Shimon Hayut" in Google,

783
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,680
that didn't give us much,
basically nothing.

784
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,480
But there's one thing that Simon Leviev
and Shimon Hayut has in common.

785
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,960
They're both from Israel.

786
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,200
We needed someone who knew Hebrew
and knew the country of Israel.

787
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,480
So we contacted
this journalist called Uri.

788
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Uri finds out the last known address for
Shimon Hayut. We need to go to Israel.

789
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,280
We're driving towards
the outskirts of the city,

790
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,360
we see more narrow streets,

791
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,360
smaller apartment buildings,
and a lot of ultra-Orthodox Jews.

792
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,040
This was the total opposite

793
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,760
of how he wanted to present his life
in social media.

794
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,080
Is it here?

795
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,920
So let's park, uh...

796
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,360
- I asked him to stay very near.
- Okay.

797
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,800
In case we need to escape.

798
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,080
Uri, Natalie, and I go out.

799
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,640
My job is to be the cameraman
that documents everything that happens.

800
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,720
That's the name.

801
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,960
That's the name. This one.

802
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,280
Hmm.

803
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,760
What's it says?

804
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,640
It's a letter for him.

805
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,320
- For Shimon?
- Shimon Hayut.

806
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,680
Yeah, this one.

807
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,120
So he might actually be staying here.

808
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,720
So this is a letter from the authorities

809
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,680
that ask money back from people
when you owe money.

810
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,320
Oh, okay.

811
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
Hello.

812
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,160
Who are you?

813
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,760
We're journalists.

814
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,240
We're looking for Simon.

815
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,480
Who is it?

816
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,920
- You are not allowed to be here.
- But, Mom, come in.

817
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,440
So, you're Simon's mother.

818
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,080
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

819
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,400
You're looking for him,
I'm looking for him.

820
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,200
He's swindled a woman in Norway
for a quarter of a million dollars.

821
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,680
I have absolutely no contact with him.
I have nothing to do with him.

822
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,600
I've not had contact with him
since he was 18 years old.

823
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:38,240
- But his registered address is here.
- He changed his name and address.

824
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,160
He is not Hayut anymore.

825
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,800
- So who is he?
- Leviev.

826
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,320
Let's go.

827
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,880
To confirm that Simon and Shimon
was the same person,

828
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,040
we need to see the local police.

829
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,480
Is this face familiar to you?

830
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,080
Yes.

831
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:07,920
In 2017, he changed his name
to Simon Leviev.

832
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,480
Before that, he was known as Shimon Hayut.

833
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,480
The police confirmed

834
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,240
that Simon Leviev and Shimon Hayut

835
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,280
is the same guy convicted in Finland.

836
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,600
He uses many names.

837
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,760
He has been a fraudster
since his late teens.

838
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,120
You start to piece together
some more of the puzzle.

839
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:45,000
Back in 2011, Simon was suspected
of stealing a check from his employer.

840
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,160
He moves on to other stolen checks
and forged checks.

841
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,480
Simon was supposed to meet in court,
but he fled the country.

842
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,040
But then he left Israel.

843
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,440
He forged a passport and left the country.

844
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,040
So he's wanted by the police?

845
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,120
Yes.

846
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,360
The Israeli authorities
demand that he be found

847
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:16,000
so the trial against him can continue.

848
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,960
And we're doing what we can
to find him and bring him in.

849
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,040
We got a lot of new
and really good information

850
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,600
after the trip to Israel,

851
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,680
but we don't know where he is right now.

852
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,920
Well, I will keep you posted.

853
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,240
Everybody else got their money,
so you should too.

854
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,600
I will see what's going on.
I will call the bank.

855
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,240
Love you. Miss you. Bye-bye.

856
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:50,800
He really apologizes and says
that he needs to borrow a little bit more.

857
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,640
I told him, "Simon, you were supposed
to transfer back this money you borrowed

858
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,120
a week or two after."

859
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,640
"Are you sure
everything is gonna be okay?"

860
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,280
He's like,
"Yeah, everything is gonna be okay."

861
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,560
So I transfer him another $10,000.

862
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,680
<i>I guarantee you
I will make payment next week.</i>

863
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:20,160
The next week,
he texts me a bank receipt for $100,000.

864
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,440
Simon is being very generous.
He only owes me 40,000.

865
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,160
<i>Oh, seriously, Simon,
that is so nice of you.</i>

866
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,040
<i>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so, so much.</i>

867
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,400
Kisses.

868
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,360
<i>Through the most difficult moments,</i>

869
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,720
<i>you have been there for me.</i>

870
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,480
<i>So that's why I wanted to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.</i>

871
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,680
And then the money just don't arrive.

872
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,120
<i>Unfortunately,
the bank want me there physically</i>

873
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,280
<i>with my lawyer
to sign some few other papers.</i>

874
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,920
<i>I need to fly and I need to fix it up.
I want to ask you a favor.</i>

875
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,760
So I pay for these flights
on my American Express card.

876
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,280
<i>The money
has left our bank account</i>

877
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,280
<i>so you have nothing to worry about.</i>

878
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,840
He asked me to help him
with another flight.

879
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,680
And then another flight,
and then another flight.

880
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,520
So with time just passing,
money doesn't come in.

881
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,840
<i>I was just at the bank
and they can't find any transfer.</i>

882
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,080
<i>And that I need to pay my bills.
I'm really freaking out.</i>

883
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,440
<i>I'm panicking. Like, I got myself
in so, so much trouble right now.</i>

884
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,640
<i>They put a stop on my account.</i>

885
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:41,640
<i>Of course I can give you
one of my watches.</i>

886
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,160
<i>I have a watch worth over 100K.</i>

887
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,320
So he tells me
he will book me a flight to wherever he is

888
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,680
within a couple of days
to collect the watch.

889
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,680
We have a lot of new information,
but we still haven't found him.

890
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,960
So what we have to do is go back into
the documentation we got from Cecilie.

891
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,640
Cecilie gave us a lot of transactions
done with her Amex card.

892
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,880
In these transactions,
we see flight tickets.

893
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,960
There are also names.

894
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,200
The business partner.

895
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,920
The bodyguard.

896
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,200
But we could also find names
of different women.

897
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,080
So one of the names
is Pernilla Sjoholm.

898
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:00,000
So I find Pernilla on Facebook
and write a message to her.

899
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,160
I... panic.

900
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,880
I thought I was gonna pass out.

901
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,800
I forward the message
straight over to Simon.

902
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,200
<i>I would not...</i>

903
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,920
He says I shouldn't worry,

904
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,840
that this is
his enemies trying to get information.

905
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,440
He really tries to calm me down and even
just, like, after hanging up the phone,

906
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,960
I'm starting to realize, like,
this can't be made up.

907
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,880
My phone rings. It is Erlend.

908
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,640
So I asked her, "Can I come to Stockholm
to meet you to talk through your story?"

909
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,600
I get on a plane.
We were meeting up the next day.

910
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,280
He tells me everything.

911
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,000
I am furious.
Why would Simon do this to me?

912
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,640
This was a friend
who I really cared about, who I loved.

913
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,440
He really created this person
that I would like,

914
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,120
someone who would be a really good friend.

915
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:37,360
So, if it's not only through romantic
relationships that he's pursuing scams,

916
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,040
what else could there be?

917
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,760
I tell Erlend
about all the travels

918
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,680
and the amount of money
he has been spending,

919
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,880
and all the other people that I have met.

920
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,800
When he tells me
about this Norwegian girl,

921
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,600
I'm starting to realize
that the amount of money she has lost

922
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,120
doesn't add up to the lifestyle
that he's been living,

923
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,760
because there is an extreme amount
of money that has been spent.

924
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,280
This must just be the tip of the iceberg.

925
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,920
After looking at Pernilla's bank accounts,
I realize this may be a Ponzi scheme.

926
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,600
He uses Cecilie's money on Pernilla,

927
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,480
and he uses Pernilla's money
on somebody else.

928
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,880
It's never his name on the credit card,
so he has plausible excuse.

929
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,120
He can always say,
"I was just borrowing the money."

930
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,320
It's almost like the perfect scam.

931
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,720
Of course, by using
one woman's credit card

932
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,080
to buy plane tickets to a second woman
and to buy a dinner to a third,

933
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:03,080
he was able to travel a lot,
and he never stayed long in one place.

934
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,960
That made it very hard for
local police authorities with low budgets

935
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,080
to go after a man that,
in their world, was like a small scam.

936
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,040
Hey, we order all the menu.

937
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,240
I ask Pernilla,
"Can you tell me where he is?"

938
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,400
I don't just only know
where he is.

939
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,160
I am booked on a flight
to go and see him tomorrow.

940
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,600
He's in Munich.

941
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,040
In less than 10 hours,
we need to be in Munich.

942
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,160
Our goal in Munich
was to film him

943
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,840
to prove to the police
that he was possible to find.

944
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,600
You're really focused.

945
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,640
You know you have this one chance
to get what you want.

946
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,760
Also you have responsibility for Pernilla.

947
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,520
Simon can absolutely not find out that
they are there or that I have done this,

948
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,960
because I don't know
if it's dangerous for me

949
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,960
if he does find out
that I'm doing this behind his back.

950
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:21,760
I'm going in there
trying to sabotage his fabulous life.

951
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,720
The plan is to keep a safe distance,

952
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,120
and to do that, Natalie is tracking
Pernilla's whereabouts on the iPhone.

953
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,960
In case Simon should look
at Pernilla's phone,

954
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,080
Pernilla saves my number
as a different name.

955
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,120
That makes it possible for Pernilla
to have constant contact with me.

956
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,720
She writes
that she's just landed.

957
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,560
We have a photographer outside the airport
who may be able to get pictures.

958
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,240
She writes, "My friend is picking me up."

959
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,880
That must be Simon.

960
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,640
I've now received a picture
from the photographer.

961
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,360
Wow, he's in Munich.

962
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,720
My heart is pounding.

963
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,880
This is the first time
I meet his business partner, Avishay,

964
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,000
that he had told me so much about.

965
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,800
I'm starting to become very, very paranoid

966
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,360
because who am I in the car with?
Who are they really?

967
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,200
I'm looking at him, and I know the truth,
like everything that he has done.

968
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,880
These former feelings that I had
that this was my friend just got erased.

969
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,160
I don't think I ever hated a person
my entire life

970
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,440
until that second
when I was sitting in that car

971
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,840
and just looking at him.

972
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,000
Pernilla texted me

973
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,640
that they were going
to Mandarin Oriental Hotel.

974
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,280
That's a fancy hotel
with a restaurant inside.

975
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,240
Okay.

976
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,080
The most important job I had in there

977
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,600
was to text Kristoffer
and the still photographer

978
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,440
whenever they were leaving the restaurant.

979
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,440
Opposite,
there's a parking garage.

980
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,600
Just behind gaps in the wall,

981
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,960
we can place our lenses
to capture Simon as he walks out.

982
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:28,200
Everyone knew about him.
"Welcome back, Mr. Leviev."

983
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,320
And that gets me going.

984
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,880
What have you been doing in Munich?
How many victims are here?

985
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,200
He tells me he's sorry
about the situation with the money

986
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,840
and he gives me the watch.

987
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,760
He orders everything on the menu,

988
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,480
and I feel so bad even sitting there
when we're having this dinner,

989
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,040
'cause the only thing
that goes in my head is,

990
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,640
"Who's paying for this dinner?"

991
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,560
We're just waiting and waiting
for a text from Natalie.

992
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,640
Simon looks in our direction, and we hide.

993
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,800
Simon starts speaking in Hebrew
and getting very upset to Avishay.

994
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,480
And I'm like, "What's going on?"

995
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,240
And they were like,
"There's a camera guy over there."

996
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,400
And he started screaming, like,
"Get into the car!"

997
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,680
Driving around so fast through Munich.

998
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:56,080
I don't know what they're saying. Do they
know that I have set them up to do this?

999
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,720
What are they really gonna do with me?

1000
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,400
Just think, like, "Pernilla, you play
your biggest act you have ever done

1001
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,600
your entire life, because otherwise
you are never coming home."

1002
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,080
I'm trying to twist everything around.

1003
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,280
I'm screaming at him, like, "Is this your
enemies? Are they after me now, Simon?"

1004
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,240
He's trying to calm down the situation,
like, "No, it's me they're after."

1005
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,600
I'm telling him, "Just drop me off."

1006
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,160
I never opened a car door
as fast in my entire life.

1007
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,680
We were very concerned
about Pernilla.

1008
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,320
We realized we wouldn't be able
to confront him there.

1009
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,840
We need to go back to Oslo
and work out our next step.

1010
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,440
I take the watch
to a pawn shop,

1011
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,880
and they tell me it is fake.

1012
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:05,240
Of course it is,
because nothing about him is real.

1013
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,880
I really want to confront him
and at least tell me the truth.

1014
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,240
That's what you want from all people.
Just tell me the truth, how it is.

1015
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,600
Pernilla really wants
to talk to him,

1016
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,200
and we are filming that call.

1017
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,280
Hello.

1018
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,200
<i>Hey, what's up? Good morning.</i>

1019
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,120
Morning.

1020
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,320
<i>Good afternoon. Sorry.</i>

1021
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,200
It's okay. What are you doing?

1022
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,400
<i>I'm all right, and you?</i>

1023
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Um...

1024
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,800
I'm not so good, Simon.

1025
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,080
<i>What is it?</i>

1026
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,200
Can you just tell me the truth?

1027
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,200
<i>I told you the truth.</i>

1028
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,280
No, you haven't told me the truth.

1029
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,200
Can you give me the entire truth?
At least I deserve that.

1030
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,760
<i>I told you the entire truth,
I don't understand what is the...</i>

1031
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,200
Simon. Simon, I lost everything I have.

1032
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,960
Can you please tell me the truth
for once. It's a little...

1033
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:02,400
<i>Pernilla, you have no idea.
My enemies are trying to...</i>

1034
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:07,480
Simon! Simon! Simon!
Simon, listen to me. I know.

1035
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,240
<i>What do you know?</i>

1036
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,160
I know about...

1037
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,880
<i>Something that I don't know?</i>

1038
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,000
<i>What do you know?</i>

1039
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,080
I know everything. Simon, I know...

1040
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:19,360
I know you're doing this fraud thing.
I know you've been in jail in Finland.

1041
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,280
I know you're...

1042
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,760
<i>What the fuck is this bullshit?</i>

1043
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,280
I know about the other people
that you have frauded.

1044
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,160
<i>You double-cross me...</i>

1045
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,520
<i>I can tell you right now,</i>

1046
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,920
<i>you will pay for this
for the rest of your life.</i>

1047
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,320
I am paying for the rest of my life.
You took everything I have.

1048
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:40,520
<i>This is your mistake. If you want
to make some claims against me,</i>

1049
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,360
<i>give me the evidence you have against me.</i>

1050
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,520
The Israeli police have confirmed you
with your picture.

1051
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,200
<i>Nobody has confirmed anything.
That's not true.</i>

1052
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,160
Yes.

1053
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,080
I had a flight to Amsterdam, right?

1054
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,760
<i>Yeah.</i>

1055
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah, who paid for that?

1056
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,360
<i>I paid for it!</i>

1057
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,320
No, you didn't.

1058
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,480
I have the transaction for the ticket,
and it's paid by another woman.

1059
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,960
<i>Because of my enemies
I couldn't use my own...</i>

1060
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,120
<i>I have paid these people in cash.</i>

1061
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,440
<i>I did give them money.</i>

1062
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,760
Simon, you can't keep doing this.

1063
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,880
Like, it's crazy.

1064
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,560
<i>Honey, what have you done this all for?</i>

1065
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,520
<i>There will be a price,
and I promise it'll be bigger than money.</i>

1066
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,200
What do you mean, the price?

1067
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,600
<i>You double-cross me,
you're gonna pay for it.</i>

1068
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,320
I really got scared,
because what have I done?

1069
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,280
The only thing that we can do is to make
the VG piece as big as possible

1070
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,800
to get his face out there,

1071
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,800
because if people would know who he is
and recognize his face,

1072
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,080
he can't do this anymore.

1073
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,680
Coming forward with a story like this
takes a lot of courage.

1074
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,320
I was feeling anxious, you know.
VG is the biggest newspaper in Norway.

1075
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,880
Like, my face would be on the front cover.

1076
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,280
There would be this big online special.

1077
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,080
I know that people were gonna judge me.
Am I ready?

1078
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,240
Your entire life
is never gonna be the same again.

1079
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:23,240
Everything just, like, went wildfire.
It felt like a nightmare.

1080
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,160
Social media is brutal, you know.
They'll eat you alive.

1081
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,160
People are saying what a gold digger
you are or, "She deserved this."

1082
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,520
A gold digger
would never give out a penny.

1083
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,440
I never understood this,
how you can blame a victim.

1084
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,280
All I did was just trying to help people.

1085
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,680
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

1086
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,560
But it was kind of nice
to just see

1087
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,200
and try to focus on the positive things
that people were writing.

1088
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,880
I could see the amount of shares.

1089
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,520
Comment after comment after comment.

1090
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,120
"Look at this story," you know.
"It's just insane."

1091
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,200
We were sitting there watching
the numbers go up and up.

1092
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:27,320
Everybody wanted to read
<i>The Tinder Swindler. </i>It was going viral.

1093
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,840
This is what I wanted.
His face is there. His name is there.

1094
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,800
No matter who he meets and he says,
"Hi. My name is Simon Leviev,"

1095
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,680
the moment they Google him now,
it will be there.

1096
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,640
I met Pernilla.
Immediately, we had a bond.

1097
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:53,160
This is the only person who really
understands what I am going through.

1098
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,480
We wanted
to keep the momentum up.

1099
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,240
We joined forces.

1100
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,440
Both of us had a goal
that this needed to come out

1101
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,360
in as many newspapers
in as many countries as possible.

1102
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,800
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

1103
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,720
First of all,
I wanted to apologize

1104
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,920
and let you know
that not all Israeli men are such crooks.

1105
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,520
Talk shows and news agencies in the US,
UK, Netherlands, Germany as well.

1106
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,880
We needed more exposure and more countries
to make their own investigations.

1107
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,160
Like, "What did he do in our country?
Do we have any victims here?"

1108
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,360
But another thing was
to actually get the police

1109
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,440
to feel the pressure from the media,
the pressure from the public,

1110
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,960
and do something about this.

1111
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,840
The response
was really overwhelming.

1112
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,400
We were contacted by victims
all over the world.

1113
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:54,480
<i>I met him on Tinder in 2015.
We met up Copenhagen...</i>

1114
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,560
<i>We dated for around six months.
He met my family and friends.</i>

1115
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,200
<i>He stayed with us in New York.</i>

1116
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,200
<i>He said his name was Shimon Yehuda Hayut.</i>

1117
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,600
<i>- His name was Mordechay Tapiro.
- His name was Simon Leviev.</i>

1118
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,440
<i>My wife and I hired Simon
to babysit our five-year-old son.</i>

1119
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,200
<i>He was 20 years old at the time.</i>

1120
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,440
<i>We knew that his father was a rabbi
and he came from a very...</i>

1121
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,656
<i>He told me
he was heir to an Israeli airline.</i>

1122
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,720
<i>He employed me as his PA.</i>

1123
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,120
<i>He hired me
as his personal chauffeur.</i>

1124
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,040
<i>And he hired a lot of expensive cars.</i>

1125
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,720
<i>He never paid the bill. $300,000.</i>

1126
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,720
<i>He told me
that he was a Mossad agent</i>

1127
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,560
<i>working undercover as a pilot.</i>

1128
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,440
<i>He spent nearly $20,000.</i>

1129
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:43,360
<i>In just three days,
he spent $42,000 on our Amex card.</i>

1130
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,720
<i>Three of our checks
had been forged.</i>

1131
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,080
<i>Nearly $50,000 in total.</i>

1132
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,760
<i>I'm still not over it,
six years later.</i>

1133
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,280
<i>I'm scared of him.</i>

1134
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,880
We got all this information,

1135
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,200
but nothing happened to him.

1136
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,320
He was still on the run,
he was still a free man,

1137
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,920
even though we knew
that he was reported to the police

1138
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,480
in at least seven different countries.

1139
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,000
I was at the airport in Prague.

1140
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:26,120
I had been visiting my boyfriend.

1141
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,320
While I was waiting for my plane to leave,

1142
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:35,760
I was scrolling through Instagram,
and I saw the picture of my boyfriend.

1143
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,800
I clicked on it.

1144
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,760
"The Tinder Swindler"?

1145
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,440
What the fuck is this?

1146
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,480
I was completely in shock.

1147
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,120
I sent the article to Simon,
and he started calling me.

1148
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,120
We were about to take off,

1149
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:59,600
so I downloaded the article
and put my phone on airplane mode.

1150
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:07,040
I saw that this girl Cecilie
met him on Tinder.

1151
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,280
I also met him on Tinder.

1152
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,640
He also took me to a five-star hotel
on the first date.

1153
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,640
I was already dating Simon for 14 months.

1154
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,480
So we were in a serious relationship.

1155
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,560
I loved him very much.

1156
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:39,520
He was very thoughtful.
He would remember every little thing.

1157
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,280
I shared my whole heart with him.

1158
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:51,400
We started talking about
settling down together, starting a family.

1159
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,800
I really felt
we were meant for each other.

1160
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,880
I was scrolling through the article.
I saw these videos coming up.

1161
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,120
Cecilie, my love, I love you.
I miss you. I can't wait to see you.

1162
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,320
He sent me the same video.

1163
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,680
Ayleen, darling,

1164
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,040
I miss you.

1165
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,080
Peter.

1166
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:25,960
I went through my WhatsApp history,
and I started to compare.

1167
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,680
He was sending exactly the same words
to her as he did to me.

1168
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,320
"Good morning, love. How are you?
I love you. I miss you."

1169
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,880
"I wanna have babies with you."

1170
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,760
He took Cecilie to Amsterdam, my hometown.

1171
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,360
Exactly the same period as we were dating,

1172
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:52,480
she was looking for houses
to start living with him in London.

1173
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,800
I was also looking for houses
in Amsterdam.

1174
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:02,520
The same day, he was flying to Oslo
for a business trip,

1175
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,040
he was just going out to see her.

1176
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:10,200
He texted me, "I'm tired as fuck."
Yeah, of course.

1177
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,360
He was with Cecilie all night.

1178
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,760
He told me that this business deal
in Munich went wrong.

1179
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,200
But he was meeting Pernilla.

1180
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,240
<i>Peter is down!</i>

1181
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:32,360
He sent exactly the same pictures to me,

1182
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,800
telling me that his enemies
had beaten Peter up.

1183
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,600
When I got those pictures,
I was terrified.

1184
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,520
It made me paranoid,
constantly looking over my shoulder.

1185
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:53,520
A few years ago, I was followed
by two guys and they beat me up.

1186
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,200
I told Simon about this.

1187
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:03,400
When Simon said I was being followed,
I was full of anxiety all the time.

1188
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,120
I'm reading that he is a fugitive.

1189
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,840
A convicted criminal.

1190
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,880
He swindled women for millions.

1191
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,680
My heart almost stopped beating,
because I also lent him money.

1192
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,560
It started off small.

1193
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:38,000
His enemies were tracking his phones,
so he asked me to get some SIM cards.

1194
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,040
So I was paying off those bills.

1195
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,840
But it became more and more and more.

1196
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:50,120
I gave him $140,000. So much money.

1197
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:58,200
Designer clothes, flight tickets
for other women. Fancy dinners.

1198
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:03,600
Now I see,
my money he spent on basically bullshit.

1199
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,360
I had so many emotions.

1200
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,520
The cheating part, the money part.

1201
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,200
On one small flight, I lost everything.

1202
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,560
I didn't want the plane to land,

1203
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:27,840
because I needed to face reality,
and that reality was terrifying.

1204
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:36,560
The moment I land in Amsterdam,
I knew he would call me.

1205
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,160
<i>...an enjoyable flight.</i>

1206
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,840
<i>Thank you for flying with us,
and have a pleasant evening.</i>

1207
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,240
<i>I mean, I don't know
where this shit came from.</i>

1208
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,840
He says the article was fake.

1209
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:05,080
Cecilie and Pernilla
would have been paid by his enemies

1210
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,240
to create this article.

1211
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,520
I knew I was defrauded.
I knew that he was fake.

1212
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,440
<i>I love you. I care about you...</i>

1213
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,320
I talked to the police.

1214
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,240
They said they needed time
to build this case,

1215
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,760
but it was something I didn't have,

1216
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,080
because I knew that Simon was a fugitive.

1217
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,840
The moment he was able to get away,
he would.

1218
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,120
I didn't want him to get away with this.

1219
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:47,000
I wanted to talk to someone
who was in the article.

1220
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,600
I found Pernilla on Instagram.

1221
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,840
So I get a message
from this Dutch girl, Ayleen,

1222
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,280
saying that she's the girlfriend of Simon,

1223
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,240
and she has seen the story

1224
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,600
and says that it feels like

1225
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,200
she is in the middle
of a horror movie right now.

1226
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,200
<i>Hi.</i>

1227
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,960
Ayleen says she's going
to help us catch him,

1228
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:17,520
but there's something
she needs to do first.

1229
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:26,080
I needed to get my money back. But how?
I had to come up with a plan.

1230
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,920
Suddenly I realized
I was in a quite powerful position.

1231
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,800
He wasn't able
to get any women on Tinder anymore

1232
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,920
because his face was all over Google.

1233
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,240
So he was hiding in Prague

1234
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,880
and he had absolutely nowhere else to go
besides me.

1235
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:58,560
He always told me keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

1236
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,400
To make him believe
I was still on his side,

1237
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:09,720
I told him I still love him,
that I believed everything he said.

1238
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,560
I even called these girls bitches.

1239
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,840
I'm texting Simon all the time,

1240
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,440
saying, "Good morning, love. How are you?"

1241
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,520
"Good night. Sleep well.
I love you. I miss you."

1242
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,560
And he keeps on telling me,
and, of course, it's Simon,

1243
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,560
that he needed money
to escape from his enemies.

1244
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,720
He needed fake passports.

1245
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,840
He wanted me to pawn my car.

1246
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,160
He wanted me to sell my house.

1247
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:50,680
That's when I got my idea. I was
going to swindle the Tinder Swindler.

1248
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,880
Simon only wears designer clothes.
He's covered in it.

1249
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,880
Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton,
Dolce & Gabbana.

1250
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,760
I work in the luxury fashion industry,

1251
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,840
so I know his wardrobe is worth a fortune.

1252
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,440
I said to him,
"Please, let me sell those clothes for you

1253
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,360
so we can generate some money."

1254
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,640
Simon has all of these clothes with him.

1255
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,240
I needed to go to Prague.

1256
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,960
Before I leave Amsterdam,
Simon had a credit card delivered to me.

1257
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,200
It says, "David Sharon."

1258
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,760
I take a picture
and send it to the police,

1259
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:42,160
telling them Simon is creating
a new identity.

1260
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,480
His address was in the middle of nowhere.

1261
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:00,400
As I'm getting closer,
my heart is pounding.

1262
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:06,720
I thought, "Oh, my God, how can I come up
with such a stupid plan?

1263
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,120
Because now I need to face him."

1264
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,880
He's not my boyfriend.
He's not the son of Lev Leviev.

1265
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,920
He's not working for LLD Diamonds.

1266
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,480
He is a fraud,

1267
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:23,360
and I have absolutely no idea
what he's capable of.

1268
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,280
He was already standing outside
waiting for me,

1269
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,520
and he hugged me
and he kissed me on the lips,

1270
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,840
and I felt disgusting.

1271
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,400
I was so angry and I wanted to scream,

1272
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,480
but the only thing I said was,
"I love you and I missed you."

1273
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,760
He made an appointment
in the center of Prague,

1274
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,080
and he wanted me to come along with him.

1275
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,160
We stopped outside this head office
of a plastic surgeon.

1276
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,360
I was like, "Oh, my God,
what are we going to do here?"

1277
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:09,720
He wanted to change his cheekbones,
his nose, his lips, maybe his chin,

1278
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,480
and the plastic surgeon says,

1279
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,440
"I'm sorry,
but I'm not going to do this surgery

1280
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,120
because only criminals want this."

1281
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,120
I almost spit out my water

1282
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,920
because I really wanted to say
to this surgeon,

1283
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,240
"But he is a criminal."

1284
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:34,720
As I'm watching this pathetic man crying
for not getting his plastic surgery,

1285
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,800
I thought,

1286
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:42,280
"If you weren't such... a piece of shit,
I would feel sorry for you."

1287
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,600
In the afternoon,
we played boyfriend and girlfriend,

1288
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,280
holding hands, having dinner together.

1289
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:58,000
But then I needed
to still sleep next to him.

1290
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:08,600
He didn't make any move, thank God,
but I was just in bed, frozen,

1291
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:12,200
looking at the ceiling all night.

1292
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:23,440
Morning finally comes,
I pack up three massive suitcases.

1293
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,960
Simon didn't even help me with it.

1294
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,160
Right before I was leaving,
he hands over this letter.

1295
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:44,600
He said, "Please read it in the plane."
I cannot get out of there fast enough.

1296
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,000
I remember that I had this letter.

1297
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,800
I have it here.

1298
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:02,040
"Dear Ayleen, well, as you know, this is
the most difficult time of my life,

1299
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:06,000
and I want to thank you
that you are standing by my side

1300
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,160
and that you don't give up on our love."

1301
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:14,360
"You are the woman of my dreams,
and I want to build a future together."

1302
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,720
"To marry you will be an honor for me."

1303
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:23,000
"And to make a family with kids together,
you are the woman I see it with."

1304
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:27,760
"You've got to help me
with everything you can."

1305
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,720
"It's for you, for your parents,
for our future. I'm worth it."

1306
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:36,200
"Now it's time
to do the impossible possible."

1307
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:40,200
"I'm blessed to have a woman like you
in my life

1308
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:43,240
to live in happy ever after."

1309
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,760
"I love you like I never loved before."

1310
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,040
"I trust you."

1311
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,520
"Don't give up."

1312
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,760
"Love you forever, yours, Simon."

1313
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,280
Just a piece of shit.

1314
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,040
I'm on Operation Sell, Sell, Sell.

1315
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:22,520
Simon is texting and calling me
all the time.

1316
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,480
"What have you sold?
Where's my money? You need to be quick."

1317
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:31,720
I keep on telling him
I haven't sold anything.

1318
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:44,040
I was selling, selling, selling. I was
never going to send him the money.

1319
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:55,280
I just got a notification that I got
an offer for one of Simon's items.

1320
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,920
Speaking of the Devil.

1321
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:00,840
So you're still
selling his things now?

1322
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,800
Yes, I'm still selling his things.

1323
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:11,240
Of course it wasn't in line
with everything that I gave him,

1324
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,920
but it felt like a little bit of payback.

1325
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,920
<i>We need the money on Monday.</i>

1326
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,760
<i>Another day, another day.
Are you trying to buy time?</i>

1327
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:32,440
<i>You're dragging it over three fucking
weeks. It doesn't take three weeks.</i>

1328
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:39,680
After a few weeks, he knows
that I was keeping the money for myself.

1329
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,440
That's when he turned around completely.

1330
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:48,040
<i>You stop playing game
with me now! Stop!</i>

1331
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:53,240
He bombs me with all these messages,
and they were so aggressive.

1332
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,680
<i>If you're active, listen to me!
You're gonna give it today.</i>

1333
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,760
<i>You don't know
where the fuck you're going.</i>

1334
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,400
Voice memos of, like, 20 minutes.

1335
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,536
<i>I'm sorry about what I said,
but that's it.</i>

1336
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,440
<i>But you're taking the piss out of me.</i>

1337
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,320
This is where I saw
his several personalities.

1338
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,240
<i>I love you
and I care about you.</i>

1339
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,760
<i>I ask a thousand fucking times.</i>

1340
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,040
<i>I ask nicely. I'm speaking to you nicely.</i>

1341
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,760
<i>I try to respect you,
but it's like you're fucking with me.</i>

1342
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
<i>You have no idea
how much I love you.</i>

1343
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,760
<i>You just need to trust me one last time.</i>

1344
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:30,760
<i>I need an answer tomorrow. Believe in me.
Have a leap of faith for one time. Do it.</i>

1345
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,160
<i>Don't send me lies.
I know how to lie.</i>

1346
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:34,640
<i>I can teach you how to lie.</i>

1347
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,960
<i>I need this money to succeed.</i>

1348
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,880
<i>Help me out here.
I don't have nobody else. I have only you.</i>

1349
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,360
<i>I'm begging from you, please.</i>

1350
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,240
<i>I give you advice. Choose it!</i>

1351
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,320
<i>You disappear.
Nobody can see your messages.</i>

1352
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,440
<i>I'm not your enemy. I'm not fighting you.</i>

1353
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:01,480
<i>And you will get the worst fucking enemy
you have ever seen in your life</i>

1354
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,480
<i>for you and for your fucking family
if you will ever play with me!</i>

1355
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,040
<i>Give it today.</i>

1356
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:14,400
<i>Look, Ayleen,
I'm sorry about everything.</i>

1357
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:17,400
<i>I give you the last fucking
warning! Today. You want war?</i>

1358
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:20,760
<i>You will get fucking war!
You will get fucking war!</i>

1359
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,080
It was a horrible experience.

1360
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:36,520
But part of me was actually enjoying
seeing him "swerm."

1361
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,280
Squirm. No.

1362
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,600
<i>Ayleen, can I ask you a favor?</i>

1363
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,480
<i>Can you put me one lottery ticket
with numbers that I can choose?</i>

1364
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:54,000
How pathetic can you be?
I thought you were a billionaire.

1365
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:05,080
He has no money coming in.
He had no one to go to.

1366
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,920
He even sent me pictures and texts

1367
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,600
that he was eating leftovers
in a shopping mall.

1368
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,080
He grew himself, like, this big beard.

1369
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:26,160
He was sleeping in hostels of $12 a night.

1370
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,760
At this moment, I see the real Simon,

1371
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:43,920
because without other people's money,
he was nobody, and he's nothing.

1372
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,320
He even called himself
"the homeless king."

1373
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:00,960
The prince of diamonds
to this homeless king.

1374
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,120
Cry me a river.

1375
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,880
One morning, I get a text from him.

1376
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:32,760
A few weeks before, he was just mentioning
he wanted to go to Greece.

1377
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:38,720
When I text him back,
my message wasn't receiving.

1378
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,160
I just saw one tick.

1379
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,720
That's when I realized
that he was on a flight,

1380
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,240
because Simon is always on his phone.

1381
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:56,920
I'm searching for flights
from Prague to Athens.

1382
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:05,480
I found a flight exactly the same time
as he went offline.

1383
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:13,680
I took a screenshot of the details,
and I sent it directly to the police.

1384
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:20,840
He wouldn't travel under Simon Leviev
because he was wanted for fraud.

1385
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:28,360
I also make sure they had the name that
I saw on the credit card, David Sharon.

1386
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:35,680
Now, it was in the hands of the police.

1387
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,240
It was one of the best moments of my life.

1388
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,240
He even says...

1389
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:13,800
He got arrested by Interpol
on a fake passport,

1390
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,600
under the name David Sharon.

1391
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,800
Yeah.

1392
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,200
Ayleen tells me, "We got him!"

1393
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,360
I just wanted to call Cecilie.

1394
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:32,960
I was like, "Are you fucking kidding me?
He's really caught? Now? Today?"

1395
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,960
I can't even describe the joy it is.

1396
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,920
This is what I wanted.
I wanted to see him in handcuffs.

1397
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:46,720
I needed justice for myself.

1398
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,360
Does he know
you gave that information to the police?

1399
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,120
No. He never believed
that I was capable of doing this.

1400
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,200
He knows now.

1401
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:00,520
Hi, Simon.

1402
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,360
Everything that we did
did have an effect.

1403
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,640
We helped at least one person,

1404
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,720
and we did get him arrested.

1405
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:12,920
Maybe not for everything that we wanted,
but he did get arrested.

1406
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,720
So our action had a reaction.

1407
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:34,120
Just got my new iPhone 12 Pro.
Just received the new shoes. Perfect.

1408
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,480
This is the real deal.
The Bentley or the Ferrari.

1409
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:20,360
I wish you
a great and magnificent evening.

1410
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,400
<i>I will proceed
with the lawsuit against you</i>

1411
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,240
<i>for defam-in-ation and lies</i>

1412
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,560
<i>and, you know, that everything is based,
basically, on a lie.</i>

1413
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:50,080
<i>And that's it, this is how it's gonna be.</i>

1414
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,120
Have you been
on Tinder since?

1415
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,000
Yes. Oh, tons. Yeah, I know.

1416
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,680
Everyone is asking me.
Tinder has nothing to do with this.

1417
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,400
I was on Tinder immediately.

1418
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,800
- You're still looking for love?
- I'm still looking for love. So...

1419
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,040
Always.
