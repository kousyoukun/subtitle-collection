00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,079
【字幕制作by豆瓣@小滑稽】

1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,079
我认为每个人都很乐于
I think everyone would love to just meet someone

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,000
在酒吧或小商店与某个人来段艳遇
in a bar or in a grocery store.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,199
但在当代社会  获得一段艳遇的最好方式是通过约会软件
But nowadays, the best way you can meet someone is on a dating app.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,480
在Tinder上你什么人都有可能遇到
You can find a bit of everything on Tinder

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,359
有些人想寻求一段稳定的长期关系或是婚姻
There are people looking for long-term relationships or marriage.

6
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,600
还有些人只是想约炮
People who just want to hook up.

7
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,240
什么人都有
Anything.

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,840
你可以从全世界范围内挑选心动嘉宾
You can pick guys from all over the world.

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,679
上面有无数人选
It's a lot of men.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,399
我们都在寻找一块未经加工的璞玉
We are all looking for that diamond in the rough.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,560
当然  你会用谷歌搜索你的每一个约会对象
And of course, you Google everyone that you're supposed to go on a date with.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,319
搜索结果肯定会很有意思  一起来看看吧
Well, this is gonna be fun.Let's swipe right on that.

13
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,920
全世界都遍布私人飞机、炫酷超跑、狂欢派对
Private jets, cool cars,amazing parties all over the world.

14
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,159
发生在我身上的则像是一部电影
What happened to me felt like a movie.

15
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,599
但在电影里总会遇到反派
But in the movies,there's always bad guys.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,759
我收到了这些威胁短信
I get these threatening messages.

17
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,960
敌人们正监视着我和我的家庭
These enemies were watching me, my family.

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,640
这他爹的糟透了
It's just been fucking hell.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,359
我简直被吓坏了
I'm shit scared.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
他们是不是已经在来的路上了？我家门锁好了没？
Are they coming now? Did we lock the door?

21
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:03,680
我再也不会这么干了
I don't think I ever will be the same again.

22
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,280
轻轻滑动几下屏幕就能永远改变你的生活
One little swipe can change your life forever.

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,319
我认为生活的核心是爱
I think the... I think life is about love,

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
因为我拥有过的最幸福的时光就是沉浸在爱里时
'cause the most happiest times I've had is when I've been in love.

25
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,599
这就是"爱"最惊人的力量  无论你曾经多么心碎
That's what's most amazing about love,no matter how many heartbreaks you've had,

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
在爱的支持下你总能度过这段艰难时光
you still go after it.

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
我爱约会
I love dating.

28
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,240
一旦在某个时刻我开始紧张了  就知道其中肯定有什么特殊的情愫
The moment I get nervous, then I know that there's something special here.

29
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,920
而我爱这种紧张的情绪  这是我想要的东西
And I love being nervous.That's the thing.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,319
我追求那种
I'm after that all-consuming, the kind of...

31
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,479
成长过程中全身心地投入
In the process of my growth

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,159
我第一段关于爱情的记忆是迪士尼
The first memories that I have about love is Disney.

33
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,599
我到现在也记得整个《美女与野兽》的故事
I had memorized the entire
<i>Beauty and the Beast</i> cassette.

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,759
我知道里面所有的歌曲
I knew all songs.

35
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,960
我真的很爱贝尔
I just love Belle.

36
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,400
她是个像我一样的小镇女孩  渴望着外面更庞大的世界
She is this small-town girl like me, hoping for something bigger.

37
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,400
在故事里她遇到了野兽  并在某种程度上解救了他
She meets this person,and then she saves him in a sense,

38
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,120
也可以说是他们互相拯救  并一起进入了完全不同往日的生活
or he saves her as well. Like,to go into a different life together.

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,960
故事所传达的“终将会有王子来拯救你”的感觉一直存在我脑子里
It just sticks with you, like, the feeling of a prince coming to save you.

40
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,639
即使你知道故事是虚假的童话  它也依然多多少少会影响到你
And I think that even though you know it's not real, it's still with you a bit.

41
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,159
或许每个人在内心深处都小小的希冀着
I think everyone has that little bit of hope deep down inside

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,439
童话故事会有成真的一天
it will be as magical as they were portraying it to be.

43
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,319
但想要在现实生活中找到帅气的白马王子
But finding Prince Charming in real life...

44
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,960
可不是件容易的事
It's a lot of work.

45
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,039
我已经用了7年Tinder
I've been on Tinder for seven years.

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,879
我是个住在伦敦的挪威人  所以我的Tinder账号会标注两个国家
I'm from Norway, but live in London.So I've been on Tinder in two countries.

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
你匹配过多少次？
How many matches have you had?

48
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,720
你真的想看看吗？
Do you really want to see?

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
-能让我们看看吗？  -没问题
- Can we see?  - Yeah.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
1024次配对
1,024 matches.

51
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,399
你可以叫我Tinder专家
Yeah, I'm a bit of a Tinder expert.You can say that.

52
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,639
Tinder账号里最重要的东西是你本人的脸部照片
The most important thing that you can have is a picture of your face,

53
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,600
还有你跟朋友的合照
then you have a picture with friends.

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,079
展现出你的社交能力是很重要的
It's important to show that you're social as well.

55
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:46,800
我的个人资料传达出我不属于“约炮文化”的一员
Feel my profile showing I'm not in the hook-up culture.

56
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,199
而是在传达我正在寻找长期的恋爱关系
Like, I'm after long-term love.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,079
如果想让我心动
For me to swipe right on a guy,

58
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,759
那么他的照片必须显示出
it needs to be that we have some similar interests

59
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,279
我们有相似的兴趣爱好
in the pictures I'm looking at.

60
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,800
可以是出门下一次很棒的馆子
Maybe like a nice dinner somewhere,

61
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,920
也可以是去海边浪  因为我真的很爱沙滩
or that you like the beach,'cause I love a beach.

62
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,000
天呀  小动物
Oh my God. Um, animals.

63
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,720
拥有一只猫猫的帅哥？  这种搭配永远不会出错
A handsome man with a cat?Like, it can't go wrong.

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,319
而你希望能遇到一个有实力的对象
And you want a guy that has ambition.

65
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,279
比如《绅士爱美人》里的玛丽莲梦露
It's like Marilyn Monroe in the movie<i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.</i>

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,439
她有这么几句台词
And then she has this quote where she says...

67
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,600
难道你不知道有钱人都喜欢美女吗？
Don't you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty?

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
你可能不会仅仅因为一个女人的美貌就想和她结婚
You might not marry a girl just because she's pretty,

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,199
但美貌也肯定是有加分作用的
but my goodness, doesn't it help?

70
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,920
这句台词太真实了  就好比你什么都想要
It is a very true quote.Like, you want the full package.

71
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,800
但往往没办法满足每一项需求
But it's not easy to find what you're looking for.

72
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,159
我不断地划动着屏幕
It's a lot of swiping.Back and forth, back and forth.

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,360
当我看见一个叫西蒙的男人  他正好符合我的审美观
When I saw Simon's pictures,he had the kind of look that I like.

74
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
他打扮十分有格调  我喜欢看男人穿西装  而西蒙有好几件西装
He was dressed very stylish. I love a guy in a suit, and he had several of those.

75
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,480
他附上了他的Instagram账户链接
And he had his link to his Instagram.

76
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
你总会去翻他们的Instagram
You always check the Insta.

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,319
他上传了很多照片  还有很多粉丝
He had so many pictures and so many followers.

78
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,959
商业见面、派对、海滩
Business meetings, parties, beaches.

79
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,199
这个家伙的生活经历和我截然不同
This guy is just having a very different life than I ever will experience.

80
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,840
我单纯地想  要是能见面就很不错了
And I was just thinking that it would be kind of cool just to meet up.

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,399
我决定把他划向右边  列入心动嘉宾
I decide to swipe right.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,120
他很快地回应了我
And then he just responds fairly quickly.

83
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,319
"我明天就要离开伦敦了  想见一面吗？"
"I'm leaving London tomorrow.Do you want to meet up?"

84
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,720
他用Whats给我发消息  
When we text on WhatsApp,he asked me to meet him

85
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,240
让我到四季酒店去找他
at the hotel that he was staying at,the Four Seasons...

86
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,759
然后他发来了谷歌地图定位  方便我过去
...and he just sent the Google Maps link,so I could know where I was gonna go.

87
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,600
我以为这会是一次一小时左右的咖啡厅约会
This was just going to be, like,an hour-long coffee,

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,160
因为他看起来是个大忙人
'cause I could just sense that this guy was a busy guy.

89
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
当我走进这家豪华酒店时  我感到格格不入
When I walk into this really fancy hotel,I feel out of place.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,199
我到得有些早  所以我决定坐下来再等会儿
I think I'm a bit early.So I just decide to sit down and wait.

91
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,519
我开始紧张了
You know, you're nervous.

92
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,439
当电梯终于发出“叮”的一声  
When the elevator door finally pings...

93
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,360
我只能想到俩字  完了
I was like, "Shit."

94
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,800
他看起来跟照片里一模一样
He looks exactly like his pictures.

95
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,600
他很有吸引力
He has this magnetism.

96
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,360
这家伙有点特别
There's something about this guy that is special.

97
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,319
我们的开场话题是他的工作
One of the first topics we talked about was his job.

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,199
他是LLD Diamonds公司的CEO
He is CEO of LLD Diamonds.

99
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,759
他通过他爸拿到了这份工作
He got the job from his dad.

100
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,720
当他提到他那外号“钻石之王”的爹时
When he mentioned that his dad was the king of diamonds,

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,399
这就意味着他是“钻石王子”
so that meant that he was the prince of diamonds,

102
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,920
我心里在想  我的天这是什么家庭啊？
I realized, like,"My God, what kind of family is this?"

103
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,879
他很快开始谈论更加私人化的话题  这就是戳我的点
Very quickly, he'd become very personal.And that's what I really liked about it.

104
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,639
他的宝贝女儿再过几周就满两周岁了
He has a baby daughter that turns two in a couple of weeks.

105
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,720
现在正在伦敦等着见他
She's there now to visit him in London,

106
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,039
但他已经跟孩子妈分手了
but he's not together with the mom anymore.

107
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,200
他很少在同一个地方待很长时间
He's rarely in one place for a very long period of time,

108
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,639
因为他曾经错过了对的人
and he just missed having someone,you know.

109
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
当我们的约会接近尾声时
When we were nearing the end of the date,

110
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,480
他说  我真想更加深入地了解你
he said, "I really want to get to know you better."

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
他们要去保加利亚出差
They were traveling to Bulgaria for a business trip,

112
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,000
他问我要不要一起去
and then he was asking me if I wanted to join them.

113
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
于是我们坐私人飞机去了那里
We're traveling by private jet.

114
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,480
他爹的  我这辈子都没经历过这么牛的事情
"Shit. Ooh, this is something new that I've never done before."

115
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,919
幸好我没有拒绝他
I felt that I would be stupid if I said no.

116
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,120
内心深处的我真的很激动
So I was kind of, like, super excited on the inside,

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,879
但我要表现得毫不在乎  因为我想
but on the outside, I kept it very cool, because I was just thinking,

118
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,919
你喜欢这家伙是吧  那你就得保持高冷状态
"Okay, you like this guy,you just need to keep your cool now."

119
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,919
西蒙让他的一个司机送我回家
Simon asked one of his drivers to take me back home,

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,600
好让我打包行李  准备护照
so I could pack some stuff,get my passport,

121
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,000
然后再把我送过去
then they will drive me back.

122
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,399
突然间就有辆劳斯莱斯在门外等我了
Suddenly, there's this Rolls-Royce waiting for me.

123
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,679
这真的好疯狂
So I was kind of like,"My God. This is insane."

124
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,679
就像在拍电影
It felt like being in a movie.

125
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,440
<i>米高梅电影出品</i>
<i>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents</i>

126
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,320
<i>一段激动人心、奢华大气、无比浪漫的冒险</i>
<i>an exciting, extravagant, romantic adventure.</i>

127
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,279
黄色的劳斯莱斯
The Yellow Rolls-Royce.

128
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,039
我尽可能地快速收拾
I can be quick when I pack.

129
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,159
我在和好姐妹们的讨论群里说了这件事
I have a messenger group with my girlfriends.

130
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,639
她们听了之后都惊呆了
My friends are freaking out.

131
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,879
这家伙是谁？  你怎么认识他的？ 你当心被绑架啊
"Who is this guy? How do you know him?You can be abducted."

132
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,080
我说我根本没想过其他的  他只是我在约会软件上约到的家伙罢了
I was like, "Oh, I didn't even think about that. I'm on a date, you know."

133
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
在机场有一整个团队等着服务我们
At the airport, there is the entire team waiting for us.

134
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,039
有个看起来像保镖的高个子
A really tall guy,which I presume is the bodyguard.

135
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,720
有几个司机  还有他的小女儿
There's a couple of drivers,and you have his little daughter.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
我看见一个带着西蒙女儿的女性
I see this woman that's with Simon's daughter.

137
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
西蒙告诉我那是他女儿的妈妈
Simon tells me that that's the baby's mother

138
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,559
这些人都要跟我们一起坐飞机
and that they're going to be on the plane with us.

139
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,919
他的前任要加入我们的第一次约会
His ex is joining us on our first date together,

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,840
我想  这真是有点意思
and I'm kind of like,"Well, this can be interesting."

141
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,600
早上好  还好吗？
Morning. How are you?Ah, good. Morning.

142
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,879
你有没有在飞机上拍视频？能给我看看吗？
Did you take videos on the plane? Show me?

143
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,559
当然拍了  我大概是飞机上最没见过世面的人
Yes. It's like the worst person.

144
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,679
如果我一个朋友在这的话  肯定会说这样的话
That's what one of my friends would say.

145
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,000
你能不要表现得这么尴尬吗？  但我对此真的难忍激动之心
"Can you stop being so awkward?"But I was very excited about it, you know.

146
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,519
这是香槟加鱼子酱   我以前从没吃过鱼子酱
It was champagne with caviar.I've never eaten caviar before.

147
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,519
接下来是寿司  真是个没体验过的世界
And then it was sushi. And it was like it was a totally different world.

148
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,639
如果我喜欢谁  我一般都会在他脸上亲一下
If I like someone, I'll give them a little kiss on the cheek.

149
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,720
快速一吻  但会非常自然  
It was quick,but it just felt very natural.

150
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,600
着陆后 我、宝宝和宝宝的妈妈一起坐进了车
When we landed, me and the baby's mother and the baby, we went into a car.

151
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,759
我抓紧机会问了她几个问题
Of course, I take the opportunity to ask some questions.

152
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,519
她告诉我西蒙是很棒的人
She tells me what a wonderful father he is,

153
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,879
即使他们分手了西蒙依然在支援她
that he's still supporting them even though they're not together anymore,

154
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,320
听到她这么说真的很暖心
which was really, really nice to hear.

155
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
到达酒店后我们办理了入住手续
When we go to the hotel, we check in,

156
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,039
走进电梯后
and when we're walking into the elevator together,

157
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,559
门刚关上的一瞬间
exactly when the door closes,

158
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,960
他一把搂住我的腰  注视着我
he takes me around the waist and he just looks at me

159
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,279
他的眼神立刻把我吸引了进去  他吻了我一下
and he draws me in and just gives me this kiss,

160
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,159
我当即感觉晕乎乎的  有几只蝴蝶在我旁边飞舞
and I was like, "Oh, shit," you know, the kind of butterflies...

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,159
这是你能拥有的最棒的
It was passionate,and was just the perfect first kiss

162
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,519
热情似火的完美初吻
that you could have, you know.

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,759
-你们一起睡了吗？  -是的
- You sleep together?  - We sleep together.

164
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,279
后来我在他背上看见一些痕迹
And then, later on, I could see that he has some marks on his back.

165
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,039
我很好奇这些是什么、哪来的  然后摸了一下
I was just wondering, like, what is this? Where, like, I was touching it.

166
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
他立刻感受到了我的触碰
And then he was kind of like, "Oh, well..."

167
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,919
他不知道要如何准确描述
He didn't exactly know how to say it,but it was, like,

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,960
他告诉我这些来自于他在南美地区监狱里的经历  我多少有些震惊
he had been in jail in South Africa.And I was like, "What?"

169
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,559
再信我一次
Just trust me once more.

170
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,600
为什么？
Why should I?

171
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,799
他在那有个交易单子
He had a deal going on there, and they had

172
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,519
但是对方背叛了他还把他坑惨了
turned their backs against him and betrayed him.

173
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,919
导致他因欺诈罪蹲了大牢
So he had gone in prison on false pretenses.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
他是无辜的
He was innocent.

175
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,679
因为他的犹太人身份  他在监狱里的日子很不好过
He had been manhandled in prison because he was Jewish.

176
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,720
这个坐拥一切的男人
Here was this guy I thought had everything going for him

177
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,679
此刻正和我一起坐在床上  如此脆弱无助
sitting on the bed with me, being really vulnerable.

178
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,000
把邮票给我
Just give me the stamps.

179
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,960
我爱你们  亚当、亚历克斯、彼得
Oh. Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter...

180
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,559
这里有一个你想拯救的家伙
Here's this kind of person that you want to save,

181
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,679
尤其是他担负着如此多责任
especially 'cause he has so much responsibility on his back.

182
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,360
每个人都仰仗着他
Everyone is relying on him.

183
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,879
尽管我们的关系进展很快
Even though things had gone very quickly with us,

184
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,120
但在这样的情况下  我感受到了和他的情绪连接
but when I sit there and I feel an emotional connection with someone

185
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,360
他正在敞开心扉  这就是我当下的感受
and they're opening up, that's just how I am as a person.

186
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,720
他开始不断地接电话  最后他告诉我
He starts getting a lot of calls,and, in the end, he just says,

187
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,320
我们的业务太忙了  要不先送你回家吧
"We're so busy. I think it's best if you just go back home."

188
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,000
说实话我有些失望
I was a bit disappointed, actually.I was kind of like...

189
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,360
我真的很想跟他共度更多时光
I wanted to spend more time with him.

190
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,759
回伦敦后  我认为我们的关系会渐渐变淡
When I came back to London, I thought the conversation would die out.

191
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,480
我不再对这件事抱有期待
I didn't expect anything.

192
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,879
我以为我深入了解他了  但其实都是表面的
I felt like I knew him more,but I didn't really "know him" know him.

193
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,919
我自以为很特殊  但当他离开后你将永远没办法知道是否如此
Like, how special was I? I felt special,but, like, when he leaves, you never know.

194
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,080
可我还是抱有希望
I was hoping. I was really hoping

195
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,840
他会回来找我
that he was gonna come back.

196
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,600
但接下来只是在聊天软件上
But then kept going with, like,good morning messages to each other

197
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,240
互发早晚的问候
and good night messages, and FaceTime.

198
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,519
他会给我展示他的下一个目的地
He was, like, tagging me where he was going.

199
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,759
当我在工作时会听到手机的提示音
When I was at work, you could hear the pinging in your phone,

200
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,759
我希望那是他发来的消息
and it was, like, "I hope that it's him."

201
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,320
他突然问我  你家地址在哪？
He just suddenly asked me,"So what's your address?"

202
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,919
我从来没有收到过这样的花束
Never, ever received a bouquet like that.

203
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,960
<i>我很想你  想跟你一起共度更多时光  爱你亲亲</i>
<i>Miss you. Wanna spend some time together... Kiss you, hug you.</i>

204
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,039
他说  感觉我们之间有些化学反应
Feel like we have something special, and he says so to me.

205
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,000
在我看来这真见鬼  
So I'm kind of like,"Oh, shit. Is this it?"

206
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,559
于是我又跟他见面了
Ah, it was so nice seeing him again.

207
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,120
当想见某个人时  我无法准确描述出这种心情
I can't even describe to someone.Like, when you really want to see someone.

208
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,679
只感觉得到我属于他  这种心情太棒了
Just feeling that you're his girl is like the best feeling.

209
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,879
但很难跟他见上一面  因为他总是在出差  
But then it was difficult to meet up with him. He was traveling a lot for business.

210
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,360
我准备回奥斯陆（挪威）  我不断地在想
I was going home to Oslo and I was thinking,

211
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,879
你可以来奥斯陆找我呀！
"Well, you can come to Oslo!"

212
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,360
他是这么回我的
And that was one of the things he said,

213
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,919
但我在奥斯陆无事可做  那里没有商业机会  宝贝 
"But, babe, I don't have anything to do in Oslo. There's no business,"

214
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
我很想他  感觉自己可能再也没办法和他见面了
and I was missing him so much, I was like,"I'm never gonna be able to see you."

215
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,279
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding me.

216
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,000
你这样的大忙人居然决定坐私人飞机
You're such a busy guy,and you decide to take a private jet

217
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,799
在凌晨三点来见我
and land at like 3:00 a.m. to come and see me.

218
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,000
我去了他所在的酒店  带着我给他买的情人节礼物
So I go to his hotel. I bought him, like, a Valentine's present.

219
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,519
是一本教人如何与挪威人谈恋爱的书
It was a book about having a relationship with a Norwegian.

220
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,000
我写了十件关于
And then I had made,like, ten things about him

221
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,359
让他之所以如此优秀的事情
that makes him wonderful,which I'd written myself.

222
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,279
然后他问我
And then he just asked me,

223
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,279
我对你是认真的  你愿意成为我的女朋友吗？
"I am serious about you.Do you want to be my girlfriend?"

224
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,799
我太震惊了  这就是那种你最想听到的话
And I'm kind of like, "Oh, shit."The kind of words that you wanted to hear.

225
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
我给了他肯定的答复  于是我们在一起了
Yeah. And then we were together.

226
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
就在那时他说他有件事想告诉我
That's when he said there was something he wants to tell me

227
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,519
如果我们真的要在一起的话
if we're gonna be together.

228
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:59,519
比起隐藏起他真实的生活
It was better to be open and honest about how his life was

229
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,000
还是以诚相待更好
than to keep it hidden.

230
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,559
他把他接下来的大单子告诉了我
He was just talking about this big deal that he needed to get done,

231
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,799
这笔订单高达7000万美元
and the deal was worth $70 million,

232
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,480
但钻石行业是个危险的行业
but the diamond industry is a dangerous business.

233
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,160
他身边环绕着威胁
He had these threats surrounding his security.

234
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,720
他在以色列有一个安全团队  彼得是该团队的头部人员
He had a security team in Israel. Peter was like the head of it.

235
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
威胁正在变得愈加明显
Threats had gotten worse.

236
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,440
他给我看了一些照片  比如装着子弹的邮件
He showed me pictures of, like,they had gotten bullets in the mail.

237
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,319
收到的葬礼花束
Funeral flowers had been sent.

238
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,559
他在特拉维夫的一套公寓里安装了闭路电视
He had CCTV of an apartment in Tel Aviv.

239
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,079
他在那休息过一段时间
He had a break-in there.

240
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,480
因为安全团队报告了伦敦的安全威胁
The security team told him that he wasn't safe in London anymore,

241
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
目前他需要远离伦敦一段时间
and for time being he needed to stay away.

242
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,799
我吓坏了
Of course, I get super scared for him.

243
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,640
我能看到其中对他施加的压力
I could just see that it was straining on him.

244
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,400
他希望我可以理解一切正在变好
He just wanted my understanding that things were gonna be fine,

245
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,000
我们将会平稳地生活在一起
and we were going to be together.

246
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,400
我说  好吧  我会在这陪你的
And I was like,"Okay. I'll be here for you."

247
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,319
回家后  我朋友搜索了列维夫家族
When I got back home, one of my friends Googled the Leviev family.

248
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,279
她说这是最有权势的大家族之一
She says this is one of the most powerful families.

249
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,519
他们如此有权势是有原因的
They've become big for a reason.

250
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,680
我必须对他所面对的事件有现实性的认知
Need to be realistic about what he's involved in.

251
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,920
我有一阵子没见过他了  自然而然的我产生了不好的猜想
I hadn't seen him in a while.And of course it made you a bit scared.

252
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,160
我在Tinder上查找他的所在地
So I check his Tinder to see where he is.

253
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,440
我看到他在另一个城市
I see that he's in a different country.

254
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
我还发现他有几张照片变了
And I also see a couple of his pictures had changed.

255
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,599
这意味着他一是在活跃状态  我悬着的心放下了  
My heart just sank, you know,'cause that means that he's been active.

256
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,039
所以究竟发生了什么？
So what's going on?

257
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,759
<i>我现在不再使用Tinder了  我删除了软件和账号</i>
<i>I'm not using Tinder anymore.I deleted the app. I deleted the account.</i>

258
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,599
他说我们是一个坚固的团队
He tells me that we're a team and we're together

259
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,839
不用担心他
and that I have nothing to worry about.

260
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,400
这里没有其他人  只有我
There's no one else. Only me.

261
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,559
<i>我很在乎你  我想你了  一切都会变好的 宝贝</i>
<i>I care about you. I miss you.And everything will be all right, baby.</i>

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,319
我坐着  不断地在手机屏幕上滑动
I was sitting by my phone,swiping, swiping.

263
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,000
你喜欢什么类型的？
What kind of guy were you hoping for?

264
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:59,000
有想法的、聪明的、有趣的  同时有冲击性的家伙
An ideal guy. A smart one. And funny.And very impulsive.

265
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,599
我一直都是个独立自主的女性
I'm a very independent woman.I always have been.

266
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,839
我从16岁起就独自在外打拼了
I've done that since the age of 16,

267
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,640
所以我不需要一个男人来照顾我
so I don't need a man to take care of me,

268
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,920
但如果有个能和我共享生活喜乐的男人也不错
but I would appreciate to have a man to share my life.

269
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,559
我的Tinder账户上什么都有
My Tinder profile was a mix.

270
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,519
有我通勤装、旅行装的照片
It had some pictures with me dressed for work, traveling,

271
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,839
因为我想吸引
because I still wanted to attract this person

272
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,720
跟我有着类似生活方式的人
that was living the same life as I did.

273
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,119
所以我不断地滑动屏幕挑选心动对象  这个家伙就出现了
So I was swiping.And then this guy comes up.

274
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,039
这个家伙看起来经常旅行
This is someone who is well-traveled.

275
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,400
工作也很努力
And still works very hard.

276
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,359
我就把他加入了候选对象
So I thought,"Oh, great. Let's swipe right on that."

277
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,640
匹配成功了
I got a match.

278
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,240
他在斯德哥尔摩出差  但据他说他住在阿姆斯特丹
He was here in Stockholm for business,but it said he was living in Amsterdam.

279
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,240
他发短信问我想不想见一面
He texts me and asks me if I want to come visit.

280
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,200
<i>明天九点有一趟</i>
<i>There is a flight tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning</i>

281
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,759
<i>从斯德哥尔摩到阿姆斯特丹的航班</i>
<i>from Stockholm to Amsterdam.</i>

282
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,559
<i>你明天能来吗</i>
<i>So tell me if it's all right for you.</i>

283
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,200
他询问了我的护照信息  帮我订了机票
He asked about my passport details,booked my flight ticket,

284
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,000
这些行为非常加分
which I thought was a nice gesture.

285
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,039
我从LLD钻石公司的西蒙列维夫那里得到了证实
I get this confirmation from Simon Leviev at LLD Diamonds.

286
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,279
当然  我打开了谷歌
Of course, I started to Google,

287
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,359
你总会搜索每一个约会对象
because you always Google everyone you're supposed to go on a date with.

288
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,440
他父亲是个钻石大亨
His father is this diamond tycoon,

289
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,279
我很惊讶  居然又是一个搞钻石的
and I'm just thinking,"Oh my God, another diamond guy."

290
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,920
-嗯  -又一个搞钻石的？
- Um...  - Another diamond guy?

291
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
对
Yeah.

292
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,880
我以前也约过搞钻石的家伙
I used to date a guy that was in the diamond industry.

293
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,759
也许这是第二次
Okay, maybe second time around.

294
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,319
我开车去了他家  他家在一个很可爱的社区里
I take a car to his house, which is in this lovely, lovely neighborhood.

295
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
他开门上前迎接我
He comes and opens up the door.

296
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,759
他穿得很高雅
He dresses very elegantly.

297
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,119
看到他的第一眼我就感觉  他有些不符合我的口味
"A little bit short for my taste,"was the first thing I was thinking,

298
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,359
但他真的很健谈
but he's really easy to talk to.

299
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,960
第一次见面就能谈得很自在  挺少见的
It's quite rare that you meet someone and you have this instant connection.

300
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,559
仅仅是一小时后
After we spent an hour together,

301
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,240
我们都感觉仿佛已经互相认识了数十年之久
we felt like we had known each other for ten years or something.

302
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,799
我们一起享用了午餐  整个餐厅的员工都在迎接我们
We go for lunch,the entire staff welcomes us.

303
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,880
他们送上了餐厅专门为西蒙特殊准备的鱼子酱
They bring a special order of caviar that the restaurant uses just for Simon.

304
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,759
我感觉菜就没断过
I don't think the food ever stopped coming in.

305
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,160
他问了我很多问题  同时很认真地倾听
He really asked a lot of questions,really wanted to listen,

306
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,799
我太欣赏这一点了
which I really appreciated.

307
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,599
能认真倾听的男人太少见了
'Cause it's quite rare to have men listen sometimes.

308
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,039
然后我们在阿姆斯特丹进行了愉快的散步  还参观了钻石博物馆
Afterwards, we had a nice, long walk around Amsterdam. I see a diamond museum.

309
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,039
我爱博物馆  如果你去参观博物馆的话
I love museums,and if you should go to a diamond museum,

310
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,200
真应该和生意人一起去
you should go with someone in the business.

311
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,200
他了解关于采矿的所有事
He knows all about the mines,

312
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,599
比如如何切割、如何得到最好品质的钻石
how to cut them,where you get the best diamonds.

313
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,359
他了如指掌
He knows everything.

314
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,200
在那之后他对我稍稍展开了攻势
After that,he makes this little bit of a move on me.

315
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,160
但我总感觉不来电
But it just doesn't feel right.

316
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,720
他说  我们还是当朋友吧
He's like, "No, maybe no.Just... Better just stay friends."

317
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,559
我同意
"Yeah, maybe you're right."

318
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,880
我们之间没有浪漫的气氛
Even though there wasn't a romantic energy between us,

319
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,559
我也很享受一个人自由自在的状态
I really enjoyed myself.

320
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,680
但事实上仅仅过了一两天我就开始想他了  因为我们在一起时真的很快乐
I actually missed him after just a day or two, because we did have a lot of fun.

321
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,400
我们不断地打电话、发短信
We were talking and calling and texting.

322
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
当他出去吃晚餐时
When he's out to dinner,

323
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,519
他发来照片  我们互发了语音消息
he sends me a picture, and we used voice notes.

324
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,160
<i>美人  美丽的佩妮拉</i>
<i>Beautiful looking.Beautiful, Pernilla.</i>

325
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,519
期待明天与你的见面
Happy to see you tomorrow.

326
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,359
有时你可以拥有两种完全不同的人格
You can be two different types of personalities sometimes.

327
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,640
你要么是充电的要么是耗电的
So either you can be a battery charger or a battery drainer.

328
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,519
<i>努力工作  尽情玩乐</i>
<i>Work hard, play hard.</i>

329
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,640
他绝对是我的充电器
And he was definitely my battery charger.

330
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,119
<i>魅力非凡的裙子</i>
<i>Amazing. Amazing. Beautiful dress.</i>

331
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,400
我记得有一次他飞过来只是为了跟我一起喝杯咖啡
Once, I remember, like, he flew over just to have a coffee with me one day

332
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,319
因为那天我过得很糟糕
because I was having a bad day.

333
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,720
<i>佩妮拉  我们十点的时候一起出去喝一杯如何</i>
<i>Pernilla, about 10 o'clock we're going for a drink.</i>

334
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,480
<i>等到十二点半的时候去俱乐部</i>
<i>Then, 12:30, we're going to the club.</i>

335
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,279
<i>等不及要见你了！</i>
<i>Can't wait to see you later!</i>

336
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,000
我在他的备注名后面加了"王子"emoji表情
I gave him a little bit of a prince emoji next to his name,

337
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,000
因为他有时的行为举止如王子一般
because that's how he's behaving sometimes.

338
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,880
我总拿这件事开玩笑
And I always make a joke about this.

339
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,119
真的感觉我们之间有特殊连接
Really felt like we had a special connection.

340
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,839
<i>等不及要见你</i>
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

341
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,559
<i>我全心全意爱你  想你</i>
<i>I love you with all my heart.I miss you so much.</i>

342
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,599
西蒙经常出差
Simon was away a lot on business.

343
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,039
我们每天都要聊天发短信
We'd talk and text every single day.

344
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,200
你的女孩今晚终于练完了瑜伽
Your girl is finally done with yoga for the night.

345
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,519
她正在家里做美味的三文鱼
And she's at home making some delicious salmon.

346
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,680
我感觉好特别
I felt special.

347
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,200
这太令人感到不可思议了
It was just amazing.

348
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,359
他说
And then, he asked me.

349
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,920
当你遇到和你有相同脑电波的人
It's just the best feeling, you know, when you have someone

350
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,440
这种感觉真的很棒
and both are on the same wavelength.

351
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
是时候拥有二人小居了
Time for apartment number two.

352
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,519
把客厅安置成可以看电影的样子
Living room where we can watch movies and stuff.

353
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,880
我一直在幻想我们两人住在一起时的生活
I was dreaming of how it would be for the two of us to live together.

354
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,279
你会有一间很棒的厨房
And then you have this awesome kitchen.

355
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,759
这里是卧室
And here is the bedroom.

356
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,720
西蒙告诉我预算是每月15000美元
Simon tells me that the budget is $15,000 per month.

357
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,599
第三套公寓
Third apartment.

358
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,599
我会在这些令人惊叹的公寓里四处活动
So I'm going all the rounds in these amazing apartments.

359
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,759
我们有时会在Facetime上聊天
And sometimes I even have Simon with me on FaceTime.

360
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,240
这是个很棒的沟通方式
It was just a really nice way to connect with him,

361
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,039
即使他不在旁边我们也能一起看房子
even though he wasn't there,to do it together.

362
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,680
这里可以看到科文特花园的广场
The view is out to the Piazza at Covent Garden.

363
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,119
塞西莉  我爱你  我等不及要和你见面了
Cecilie, my love, I love you, I miss you.I can't wait to see you.

364
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,240
午夜时西蒙给我发了一张他的保镖彼得的照片
In the middle of the night, I get a picture of Peter, Simon's bodyguard.

365
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,759
西蒙写到  彼得受伤了  我不敢相信
Simon is writing "Peter hurt,"and I'm like, "What the fuck?"

366
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,160
已经半夜了
Well, this is the night.

367
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,799
你能写下你的名字吗？  要不我来写也行
Can you write your first name?Or I can write it, of course.

368
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,960
我们在救护车里
We're in an ambulance.

369
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,119
你能写下来吗？
Can you write that?

370
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,920
他说  他们在追杀我  希望上天保佑彼得平安无事
He just says that, "They were going after me. Thank God for Peter."

371
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
如果不行的话我会死掉
"If not, I would be dead."

372
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,200
<i>没事的 </i>
<i>It's okay, love. It's okay.</i>

373
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,400
<i>我告诉过你我们处在战争中  我们要变得更加坚强</i>
<i>I told you, we're in a war.We need to be strong.</i>

374
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,640
我不知道该做什么  而他反复说  我们现在安全了
I didn't know what to do.And he just says, "We're safe now."

375
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,119
我们得到接应了  你放心去睡吧
"We're being taken care of.You just need to sleep."

376
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,279
第二天西蒙发来一条语音信息
The next morning,Simon sends me a voice note.

377
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,680
<i> 基于目前的情况和安全措施</i>
<i>Because of the situation,with the security and everything,</i>

378
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,160
<i>他们告诉我我现在无法使用信用卡</i>
<i>they told me I'm not allowed to use my credit card.</i>

379
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,720
他没办法使用信用卡
He can't use his cards anymore because the security team has said his enemies

380
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:56,480
因为他的安全团队说他的敌人正在通过信用卡使用情况追踪他
are tracing his spending and where he is based on his credit card use.

381
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,559
<i>我想请你帮我一个忙</i>
<i>I wanted to ask you a favor.</i>

382
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,799
<i>如果你有美国运通信用卡</i>
<i>If you have an American Express credit card,</i>

383
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,720
<i>我可以把它连接到我的账户</i>
<i>I can link it to my account.</i>

384
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,480
他想知道能否借用我的卡
He was just wondering if he could use my cards for some time.

385
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,720
这将对他有极大帮助
It would just help him a lot.

386
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,880
<i>这是暂时性的</i>
<i>It's just temporary,like, for, uh,</i>

387
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,319
<i>大概只需要用两周</i>
<i>two weeks or something.</i>

388
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
我是他女朋友
I'm his girlfriend.

389
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:22,200
他来寻求我的帮助是很正常的  我们互相信任
Of course he would ask me.Like, you trust me and I trust you,

390
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,880
我们自然会互相帮助  这对我来说甚至算不上是个问题
so of course we're gonna help each other.It wasn't even a question.

391
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,920
他开始按照他说的那样使用我的运通卡
The Platinum Amex is in my name, and he starts using it as he said he would,

392
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,440
但我的卡很快就被刷爆了
but he maxes out quite quickly.

393
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,720
所以他直接向美国运通付款  我再从他那里拿到收据
So he makes payment directly to Amex, and I get the receipt from him,

394
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,279
他说钱已经在路上了  但同时
and he says that the money is on the way,but in the meantime,

395
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:55,640
他想让我带25000美元现金到阿姆斯特丹去
he wants me to come to Amsterdam and bring some cash to him. $25,000.

396
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,279
我要怎样才能找到这么一大堆现金？
How on Earth am I going to get that amount of cash?

397
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,559
我借了一笔贷款  然后换成现金
I took out a loan,which I then took out in cash.

398
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,720
把如此巨款携带在身上让我十分害怕
I was super scared having that amount of cash in my bag.

399
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,319
尤其是过安检的时候
Especially when we went through security.

400
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,079
压力爆棚
I was super stressed.

401
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,000
如果他们找我问话  我该怎么解释？
How was I gonna explain the money if I got any questions about it?

402
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,240
跟他呆在一起的时候我非常有安全感  我最大的担忧是和他分开
The moment I'm with him, I feel safe.My biggest issue was being apart from him.

403
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,039
他很感激我
He was really grateful.

404
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:00,519
他说我所做的一切都是在护他周全
He told me that everything I was doing is keeping him safe.

405
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,599
但随着时间流逝  安全团队表示出问题了
But within hours, the security team said there was a problem.

406
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:13,839
安全起见他删除了Instagram账号
He deletes his Instagram because of security measures,

407
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,440
然后他请求我让我把我的账号设成私密状态
and then he asked me to make my account private.

408
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,079
把一切都清除掉
Take it all away.

409
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,079
他说他们可以来帮我度过难关
He says that they can come and get me through him.

410
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,359
我脑子乱了  这他爹的什么情况？
Of course, I get paranoid.What the fuck is going on?

411
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,240
随后西蒙接了个电话
Later on, Simon gets a call.

412
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,160
他打开了扬声器跟彼得通话
He puts Peter on the speakerphone,and he says,

413
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,160
西蒙  出现了安全漏洞   他们知道你在哪了
"Simon, there's been a security breach.They know where you are."

414
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,839
飞机马上起飞  我不能告诉你目的地
"The plane is ready to leave.I can't tell you where you're going."

415
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,920
彼得问他能不能把公寓里的灯关掉
Peter is asking if he can please turn off the lights in the apartment.

416
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,319
我吓坏了  他们要来了？门锁好了没？
I'm shit scared. Are they coming now?Did we lock the door?

417
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,240
看到你非常在乎的人处在危险之中
Just seeing someone that you care so much for in danger,

418
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,319
你可以看到他精神状态不佳
and, like, you can see that he was not doing well mentally.

419
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,480
他在苦苦挣扎
I could see that he was struggling so much.

420
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,039
最后他告诉我他不得不离开了
And in the end,he just told me that he had to go.

421
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,319
当他在斯德哥尔摩着陆后他给我发了地理定位  
When he lands, he sends me the geotag.He's landed in Stockholm.

422
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,160
他自发地来到这里
He is here. Very spontaneous.

423
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,559
我问他
So I ask him...

424
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,160
这个俱乐部里简直是女人堆
The club is basically an ocean with women,

425
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,880
或者按我的说法  香槟女孩
or as I call them, champagne girls.

426
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,440
他们基本上就像苍蝇
They are basically like flies.

427
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,160
你掏出腐烂的香蕉  他们立刻就围上来了
Like, you put out a rotten banana,and they just attack,

428
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,720
这些女孩则是对香槟做着类似的事情
but these girls do the same thing when they see a bottle of champagne.

429
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,599
西蒙当然要为整个场子买单
And Simon is of course paying for this entire circus.

430
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,119
他用现金支付  确保每个人都玩得尽兴
He's paying with cash and just making sure hat everyone is having a good time.

431
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,719
每个人都很快就醉醺醺了  尤其是他的保镖彼得
All of them are quite drunk,especially Simon's bodyguard, Peter.

432
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,880
这不是我习惯的场合
This is not an environment that I want to be in.

433
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,320
所以我只待了十几分钟就说
So I just stay for 10, 15 minutes and then just say,

434
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,920
明天再谈吧  祝你今夜玩得愉快
"Let's talk tomorrow and enjoy your night and have fun."

435
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,840
第二天早上我发短信问他宿醉还好吗
The morning after, I text him and ask how the hangover is

436
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,800
要不要一起喝杯咖啡清醒一下
and maybe if he needs a cup of coffee, we should go for one,

437
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,760
他很快就回我了
and then he texts me back.

438
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,400
他已经到西班牙了
He's already in Spain.

439
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,159
刷的我的卡
The Amex card is in my name.

440
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,119
<i>欢迎光临美国运通</i>
<i>Welcome to American Express.</i>

441
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,400
所以我不得不假装我是那个四处旅行的人
So I had to pretend that I was the one traveling around, you know.

442
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,679
<i>我很理解您的卡现在无法使用</i>
<i>I understand your card isn't working.</i>

443
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,000
<i> 我会为您寻找能提供帮助的人  </i>
<i>I'll connect you with someone who can assist. Say or enter...</i>

444
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,760
我需要确切知道他到底花了多少钱  在哪家酒店
I needed to know exactly the amount that he was spending, which hotel he was in,

445
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:34,719
这样他们才会相信我是那个使用卡的人
so they would believe that I was the one using the card.

446
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,119
<i>我们要出发去旅行了</i>
<i>We need to go. We need to travel.</i>

447
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,679
<i>这让事情变得非常复杂  亲爱的</i>
<i>It's making things  very complicated, honey.</i>

448
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,320
几小时后他又打了一次电话  但再次被拦截了
Couple of hours later he would call again, and it's blocked again.

449
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,360
<i>欢迎光临美国运通</i>
<i>Welcome to American Express.</i>

450
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,880
我需要给美国运通打电话
Then I need to call Amex,

451
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,559
西蒙之前就告诉我会发生这样的事情
and Simon had already told me that this would happen,

452
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,800
其实我最开始就应该
that it would be something that I would need to do at the start

453
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
给美国运通公司打电话让他们修复问题
to call them and fix this.

454
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,480
另一个问题是信用额度不够
The other problem was that the credit limit wasn't enough.

455
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:09,679
我们必须提高信用额度  因为他有一整个团队去消耗它
We had to get it up so he could spend it, 'cause he had an entire team, you know.

456
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,239
我说  好吧  但是你要怎么做？
So I was like,"Okay, but how are you going to do that?"

457
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,880
他说  我可以聘用你
He said, "Well, I can employ you."

458
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,519
他给LLD钻石公司打电话  并且问我要了护照的详细资料
He then calls someone in LLD Diamonds and asks for my passport details,

459
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,519
这样我就能办理入职手续了
so I can be put into the employment registry.

460
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,760
我说  但我实际上并不在这里工作啊
I just tried to say,"Well, I am not really working there."

461
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,119
他说  现在你在了  我是CEO  如果他们打电话来那就是说你正式入职了
He's like, "Well, you are. I'm the CEO.If they call, you are employed."

462
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,199
<i> 如果不是因为这些安全问题</i>
<i>I would never ask you for anything if it was not serious shit.</i>

463
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,880
<i>我永远不会向你索要任何东西</i>
<i>All these security issues,</i>

464
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,519
<i>谢谢你亲爱的  一直守候着我  </i>
<i>you've always been there for me, so thank you, my love.</i>

465
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,760
此时我们正处于危机之中   现在还能怎么办？
We were in a crisis at this point.Like, what else are we gonna do?

466
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,440
于是我被聘用了  还有工资单
So then I got employed. I got pay slips.

467
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,119
-多少钱？  -挺多的
- How much?  - Earning so much.

468
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,360
每个月大概94000美元
I think it was, like, $94,000 per month.

469
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,280
我把这封信寄出去证明我挣的钱足够偿还金额
I send this over to prove that I earn much more.

470
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,840
于是他们提高了我的信用卡额度
That makes them raise the credit limit like this.

471
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,880
当然  你会有些担心
Of course, you are a bit worried,

472
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,960
但他从瑞士信贷给我寄了一张收据
but he sends me a receipt from Credit Suisse

473
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,199
他从那里直接转账给我
where he's making a transfer directly to me.

474
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,159
一共25万美元
It's for $250,000.

475
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:28,519
这足以支付他用我的卡花的钱
It's more than enough to pay for the amount that he was spending.

476
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,960
米克诺斯是天然的乐园
Mykonos is like a perfect playground.

477
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:52,239
你会看到很多游艇、名人、模特
You will see a lot of yachts,a lot of celebrities, a lot of models.

478
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,280
你打包上所有的比基尼   而且白昼的派对也能用上它们
You pack all your bikinis, definitely,for the daytime parties as well.

479
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,199
我在跟西蒙打电话
I am on the phone with Simon,

480
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,480
他告诉我他有新女友了
and he tells me he has just met his new girlfriend.

481
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,719
叫波琳娜
Polina.

482
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,920
我让他们在米克诺斯跟我们见面  他同意了
I tell him they should meet us in Mykonos,and he does.

483
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,639
我打算去奥斯陆见我的朋友们和家人
I was going to Oslo.To see my friends, see my family.

484
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,840
我真的很想把西蒙介绍给他们
And I really wanted to introduce him.

485
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,559
我等着他  他说他第二天会来
I'm just waiting for him.He said he was gonna come the next day.

486
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,800
我第一次见到了波琳娜
I meet Polina for the first time.

487
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,480
她是典型的来自俄罗斯的年轻模特  但很脚踏实地
She's this typical, like, Russian model.Quite young. But she's very down to earth.

488
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,920
我很喜欢她
And I really liked her.

489
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,679
他似乎对她非常着迷  看起来也很般配
He seems very smitten over her.They seemed like a good match.

490
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,440
<i>我现在没办法过来</i>
<i>Look, I cannot come right now.I cannot.</i>

491
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,320
安全团队告诉过他  "你需要远离那里"
The security team had told him,"You need to stay away."

492
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,159
我太失望了
I felt deeply disappointed.

493
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,840
但最重要的事情是他的安全
But what's most important is actually to keep him safe.

494
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,719
他订了豪华套房
Of course he had booked the grand suite,

495
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,360
带私人泳池的那种
with own private pool.

496
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,480
大概5000美元一晚上  这太奢侈了
It's about $5,000 a night, this room.It's absolutely gorgeous.

497
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,400
<i>我知道你不喜欢给银行打电话</i>
<i>I know you hate to ring up the bank,</i>

498
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
<i>但有时不得不这么做</i>
<i>but sometimes it is necessary.</i>

499
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,119
<i>我需要为团队里的其他成员订票</i>
<i>I need to book some tickets for the rest of the team.</i>

500
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,760
突然间需要为整个团队筹集这么多钱
Suddenly need to get so much money for this entire team

501
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,599
商务舱、昂贵的晚餐
that is traveling business class, that is having expensive dinners.

502
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:41,440
他们和客户一同出游
Like, they're going out with clients,and the spend is to another level

503
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,000
而他们消费的奢侈程度是我闻所未闻的
that you have never, ever seen before.

504
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,800
<i>这就是我的日常  永远都有会议要开</i>
<i>This is what I do all the time.Just meetings and more meetings.</i>

505
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,800
2万美元是很大一笔钱   但这仅仅是他三天的费用
$20,000 is a lot of money,and that was spent in three days.

506
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,880
西蒙问  现在去哪呢？
Simon asks, "Where should we go now?"

507
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:13,199
我们决定去被称为亿万富翁俱乐部的Bonbonniere
We decide to go to Bonbonniere,also known as the billionaire's club.

508
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,280
只有预定了桌子才能进来
You don't get in here without paying for a table,

509
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,519
费用大概是2000美元
which is normally $2,000.

510
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,400
对这里的人来说  这笔钱简直微不足道
For people here, this is peanuts for them. This is coffee money.

511
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,199
他又把信用卡刷爆了
He maxes out  the credit card again.

512
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,559
所以他让我再去贷款
So he told me to get more loans.

513
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,119
<i>不要担心  我会解决这个问题</i>
<i>Don't worry,I will finish this deal.</i>

514
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,599
<i>香槟尽管喝  我请客</i>
<i>Champagne's on me.</i>

515
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,039
西蒙点了几瓶香槟
Simon orders in a couple of bottles of champagne.

516
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,800
在我们还没来得及插手之前
Before we even have time to try and chip in,

517
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,840
他已经买了单
he has already paid for the bill.

518
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,920
西蒙出手很阔绰
Simon is very generous.

519
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,599
我贷了4万美元
I take out a loan for $40,000.

520
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,280
西蒙和波琳娜继续享受他们的夏日旅行
Simon and Polina were continuing their little summer tour.

521
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,840
<i>我本来有另一个单子</i>
<i>I tried to do,like, another transaction,</i>

522
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,719
<i>但谈失败了</i>
<i>and it didn't go through.</i>

523
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,840
每隔两三天他就会有新需求
Every second or third day is a new request.

524
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,440
先是法国   然后去了维也纳、瑞士
France, and then they were going Vienna. They were going Switzerland.

525
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,920
<i>这笔交易马上就完成了</i>
<i>Almost there.I'm 97% done with the deals.</i>

526
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
他每刷爆一次卡   我就得贷更多的款
Each time he maxes out the card,I have to take out a new loan.

527
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,760
在Instabank贷5万刀  DNB贷12500刀  再用信用卡贷1万刀
$50,000 Instabank. $12,500 DNB.$10,000 for a credit card.

528
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,639
罗马见  我们要去看斗兽场
"Let's meet up in Rome.We need to go and see the Coliseum."

529
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,519
你好
Hello.

530
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,119
嗨
Hello.

531
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:48,639
这辆巨帅的劳斯莱斯幻影
This amazing Rolls-Royce Phantom

532
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,400
载着我们在各个著名景点之间溜达
is taking us around all the famous sites,

533
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,920
比如西班牙阶梯、罗马斗兽场
like the Spanish Stairs, the Coliseum,

534
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,599
往许愿池里扔几枚硬币
the Trevi Fountain to throw a few pennies.

535
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,400
我的生活里需要更多好运  希望许愿池能有效
I definitely need some more luck in my life. Let's see if this can sort it out.

536
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,239
<i>看看银行卡什么情况</i>
<i>Check what is going on with the card.</i>

537
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,480
<i>就现在看  很重要</i>
<i>Now. It's important.</i>

538
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,679
他之前向我承诺的钱款仍然没打到我的账户上
Money he had promised me still hasn't come into my account.

539
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,880
<i>这笔单子马上就谈好了  所以你不用担心偿还贷款的事</i>
<i>I've already done it so it doesn't matter right now.</i>

540
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,880
<i>但我们得想个办法解决目前的问题</i>
<i>We need a solution right now for the current situation.</i>

541
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,519
另一个人的生活完全依赖于我
It's kind of like a pressure that I have never experienced before

542
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,559
这是我从未有过的巨大压力
to have someone's life depending on what you're doing.

543
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:28,360
<i>你知道的  我面临着安全威胁</i>
<i>You know,I'm facing security threats</i>

544
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,400
<i>有些人在追杀我</i>
<i>with people trying to kill me.</i>

545
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,039
如果他没办法用银行卡、出了岔子  他就会陷入危险的境地
If he couldn't use the card, if something went wrong, he could be in danger.

546
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,760
如果连我都不帮他  那他该怎么办？
And if I didn't help him,what might happen?

547
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,599
早上好
Morning.

548
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:48,880
你为我做的事情和我们正在共渡的难关
<i>The things you're doing for me,the things we're going through together,</i>

549
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,840
<i>都是为了日后的安稳生活</i>
<i>it's for life.</i>

550
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,639
<i>经过这些事情  我知道你注定是我生命里的唯一</i>
<i>This is what is making me see that you are the one.</i>

551
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,480
在Monobank贷2万刀  在北欧联合银行贷15000刀
$20,000, Monobank. $15,000, Nordea.

552
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,679
我们给对方来了个大大的拥抱
We all give each other a big hug

553
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:02,079
纷纷同意应该在不久后再次见面
and say that we should meet again soon,

554
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,159
比如在这个令人惊叹的夏季之后
after just like an amazing summer, really.

555
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,679
你借了多少钱？
How much had you taken?

556
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,679
25万美元  我没想到会走到这一步
$250,000. That's not what I signed up for.

557
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,400
-很大一笔钱  -确实
- A lot.  - It is a lot of money.

558
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,800
<i>我知道你</i>
<i>I know you have done, uh, too much,</i>

559
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,519
<i>为我做了许多事</i>
<i>for me, for us, for everything.</i>

560
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,920
<i>我也知道你累了  只想跟我安心在一起</i>
<i>I know you're tired and you want to be together,</i>

561
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,679
<i>我也想</i>
<i>which, of course, I do want as well.</i>

562
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,719
<i>我很理解你的感受  一切都会变好的</i>
<i>I understand.Everything will be all right.</i>

563
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:50,039
当他让我去阿姆斯特丹  说可以把支票给我时
I was getting so tired and annoyed and I just needed some kind of money.

564
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:54,639
我很疲惫也烦了  只想把钱要回来
That's when he says, "You can come to Amsterdam and I can give you a check."

565
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,239
他变得有些冷酷   对我的爱不似从前
He seemed colder.Wasn't the same kind of affection.

566
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,440
他仿佛被厚厚的乌云笼罩着  我无法看透他的眼睛
There was almost a cloud across his eyes that I couldn't pierce through.

567
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:20,679
当我们走进公寓  支票已经放在那了
When we get into the apartment, the check is already there.

568
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,519
支票的金额远超我目前的负债数量
The check is worth much more than the debt I have now.

569
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:34,039
我们尝试变回从前那样  但我们中间出现了裂缝
We're trying to be together.But I can just feel a distance.

570
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,360
那个夜晚很难熬
It wasn't a good night.

571
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,960
我从阿姆斯特丹回来后的干的第一件事就是把支票兑现
The first thing I do when I come back from Amsterdam is cash this check.

572
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,599
我真的需要靠这张支票渡过难关
I really needed that check to go through.

573
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,480
我在八九个地方欠下了债
I had eight, nine creditors, you know.

574
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,199
同时还有一大堆邮件要处理
That's a lot of emails coming down on you at the same time.

575
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:18,119
我每天都要查询我的银行账户
I check my bank account every single day.

576
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,280
四天后我给银行打了电话
When four days have passed,I just know that I need to call the bank.

577
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:36,199
<i>请问有什么可以帮到您的吗？</i>
<i>How can I help you today?</i>

578
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,679
她说这张支票无法兑现
She says, "We won't cash it."

579
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,480
而且不能告诉我原因
And she couldn't tell me why.

580
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:45,320
听到这句话时
And that's when I was just standing on the phone, like,

581
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,480
我几乎快要窒息
feeling that I had hard to breathe.

582
00:45:57,639 --> 00:45:59,416
<i>塞西莉  我不明白</i>
<i>Cecilie, I don't understand.We have...</i>

583
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,000
我质问他为什么支票没办法兑现
I was asking about the check,like, "It didn't work."

584
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,000
他说  去他的吧  我给过你钱了  
He says, "Well, fuck it.I gave you the money, so..."

585
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,920
反正我该做的都做了
"I did my deal."

586
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,079
<i>你自己看着办</i>
<i>I already done it.</i>

587
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:11,400
我从未听过他如此冷酷的声音
Never hear him so cold in my life.

588
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,519
正在跟我通话的这个人听起来就像是陌生人
It was like that person on the phone was no longer my boyfriend.

589
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:18,679
他再也不是我的男朋友了
Was no longer my boyfriend.

590
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,039
只有黑暗
I... It was just a, uh... just a darkness.

591
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,880
我知道我现在的处境跟屎一样
I know I was in deep shit.

592
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,440
如果是你在九家银行同时欠债 你该怎么办？
Like, what do you do when you have nine creditors on you?

593
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:48,440
我打通了美国运通的帮助热线
I called the Amex helpline.

594
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,519
他们听得出来我现在压力爆棚
They can hear how stressed I am.

595
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:54,880
他们说  呆在原地别动  我们会来找你的
They just said,"Stay put. We will come to you."

596
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:01,840
我怕得要死  我以为他们马上就要上门来逮捕我
I was shit scared they were gonna come and handcuff me

597
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
把我带进警察局
and take me away.

598
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,599
我邮去的文件资料
The documents that I sent over.

599
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:09,480
我在电话里撒的谎
The lies I told on the phone.

600
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,400
我给西蒙的卡
I gave him my card.

601
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,320
我把这些一五一十全告诉了他们
I tell them everything.

602
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,440
他们问我有没有西蒙的照片
They said, "Do you have a picture of him?"

603
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,840
他们一看见照片就认出了他
That moment when they look at each other and they say that's the guy.

604
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,679
卧槽绝了
Fuck. Shit. You know?

605
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,320
他还用过什么名字？  我说西蒙列维夫
"What kind of name did he use?"And then I said Simon Leviev.

606
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,679
他们说这是他无数个曾用名之一
And they said, "Well, that's one of many names that he's been using."

607
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:51,559
无数个名字？
"Many names"?

608
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,519
跟我同床共枕过的这个人到底是谁？
Who is this guy I've been sharing the same bed with?

609
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:59,000
他是个以此为生的专业骗子  
"He's a professional.He does this for a living."

610
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,800
一切都是谎言
Everything's a lie.

611
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,039
他既不是所谓的"钻石王子"  也不是亿万富翁
He's not a prince of diamonds.He's not the son of a billionaire.

612
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,840
我爱的那个男人从来就没存在过
The man I loved was never real.

613
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,679
他编造了一切
He faked everything.

614
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:21,159
这太恐怖了
It was horrible, you know.

615
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,039
因为我
'Cause I still...

616
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,920
某种程度上还爱着他
In a sense, I still loved him, you know?

617
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,280
或者说我爱着曾经的他  即使知道一切都是谎言
Or the person I thought that he was.Like, you know everything is a lie,

618
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,280
但当你看到你手机里那些仍然存在的童话故事...
but then you still have this fairy tale that's going on, on your phone.

619
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,320
西蒙和那颗真心仿佛依然在跳动
Simon, with still the heart behind it,'cause I couldn't remove it.

620
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,800
我依然希冀着他是真实的
'Cause I still wanted him to be true.

621
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,239
我真他爹的不懂为什么会有这么恶毒的人
I don't understand how someone can be so fucking evil.

622
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:52,920
我曾感觉他是懂我的
I felt that he knew me.

623
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,800
他们走后我和我妈妈打了电话
The minute they're gone,I want to speak to my mom.

624
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,559
她说  你需要回到挪威来
She just told me,"You need to get back home to Norway."

625
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:10,079
跟我待在一起
"I need you to be with me."

626
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,679
我正在浏览短信
I was going through the messages in the text.

627
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,960
我问他  我们什么时候把钱的问题解决好？
I was still asking,"When are we going to fix the money?"

628
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,880
他给我发的最后一条消息是  我在解决了
The last messages between the two of us is like, "I'm working on it."

629
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,199
然后我就把他拉黑了
And then I blocked him.

630
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,840
没什么好说的了
There was nothing else to say.

631
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,239
我想起来他还存过我妈妈的电话
That's when I remember he has my mom's number.

632
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,039
<i>我不明白你为什么要拉黑我</i>
<i>Hey, you blocked me,I don't know what is your reason.</i>

633
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,119
<i>我要去找你  反正你也不想跟我说话</i>
<i>I'm trying to reach you.You don't want to talk anyway.</i>

634
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,559
<i>我要找你说事情  你最好识相点</i>
<i>I want to tell you something.Take my advice.</i>

635
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,159
<i>等着吧</i>
<i>Just watch out.</i>

636
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,519
<i>只有我真正行动了你才会有反应</i>
<i>Because with every action there will be a reaction.</i>

637
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,559
我吓坏了
I got super scared.

638
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:22,920
但我妈妈比我还要害怕
But my mom got even more scared.

639
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,320
我们向挪威警察局报了警  因为他有我的全部信息
We call the police in Norway,because he knows everything about me.

640
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,960
他有我护照的详细信息  关于我住在哪、我妈妈住在哪
He has all my passport details, where I was living, where my mom is living.

641
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,199
他给我妈妈打过电话  他知道我在哪
He's spoken to her on the phone.He knows where I am.

642
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,480
但似乎警察对此毫不在意
But the police didn't seem to care.

643
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,000
我不知道他会做出什么事情
I don't know what he is capable of.

644
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,719
我好几天都过着提心吊胆的日子
I've been on the edge for several days.

645
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,119
我必须把这件事告诉我所有的负债银行
I had all these creditors.I had to let them know, each one of them.

646
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,559
不仅仅是其中一两家  必须每家都通知到
It wasn't just two banks.There were, like, nine of them.

647
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,920
对于利息如此高额的贷款来说  这些银行简直要把我生吞活剥掉
For this kind of loan, the interest is so high, that they would just eat me alive.

648
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,360
我正在掉进万劫不复的深渊
I felt that I was just drowning.

649
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,039
而且有人一个劲地把我往下拽
It was like someone was just dragging me to the bottom.

650
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:36,719
我正沿着这条路开  看见一辆向我驶来的拖车
I was driving down this road,and I saw a trailer coming towards me,

651
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,920
我想
and I was thinking...

652
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,400
我直接撞上去会怎样呢？
"What if I just take the car over," you know?

653
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,880
会出车祸 
And just hit...  just hit the trailer, you know?

654
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,639
但至少这些乱七八糟的事就没了  那时真的很绝望
Then at least it's done, you know?And that's when I got scared.

655
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:54,440
感觉看不到盼头了
That's when I got really scared.

656
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,800
我把自己送进了精神病院  因为我不知道该怎么办
I put myself into a psychiatric ward because I didn't know what to do.

657
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:14,280
我当时在家里  看到手机屏幕在发亮
I was at home, and I could see the phone started flashing.

658
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,199
是西蒙  他给我发来了新闻
I see it's Simon,and he has sent me news articles.

659
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,119
因为一起大型钻石走私案
Simon's father is gonna be questioned by the police

660
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,360
西蒙的爸爸将被警察审问
in a big diamond smuggling case.

661
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:37,199
西蒙的家人被捕了  俄罗斯也参与其中
Members of Simon's family have gotten arrested. Russia is involved.

662
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,840
我给他打了电话
I give him a call.

663
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,079
<i>听起来很让人害怕</i>
<i>That sounds really scary...</i>

664
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,440
他听起来一团糟
He sounds all over the place.

665
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,800
他说警察进他家了  并且会冻结他们所有账户和信用卡
He says police went in. They have shut down all accounts, all credit cards.

666
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,800
办公室有个女孩跳楼自杀了
One girl in the office literally jumped from the building and killed herself.

667
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,239
但西蒙不相信这个女孩是自己跳下去的
But Simon says he doesn't believe that this lady jumped off a building.

668
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,159
他认为是有人把她丢下去的
He believes that someone went in and threw her out.

669
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:05,719
<i>我们别无选择</i>
<i>We don't have the options,you know, the...</i>

670
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,480
我很害怕  我问他到底怎么回事
And I'm getting so scared.I'm like, "What is really going on?"

671
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:13,840
他说目前安全形势不容乐观
And he says that the security situation right now is really bad.

672
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,519
<i>这是我这辈子最糟糕的夜晚</i>
<i>I have the worst night in my life.</i>

673
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:21,199
几天后我的手机响个不停
A few days later,I can feel my phone buzzing.

674
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:24,639
西蒙发了很多短信
Simon is sending a lot of messages.

675
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,039
<i>我的天啊昨晚到底怎么了？</i>
<i>Oh, my God, what happened last night?</i>

676
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,639
<i>有人想捅我刀子</i>
<i>Someone tried to stab me, and</i>

677
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:35,519
<i>彼得的手也骨折了</i>
<i>so Peter broke his hand.</i>

678
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,679
<i>天呀  怎么会有人想捅你？</i>
<i>Jesus.What do you mean tried to stab you?</i>

679
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,119
<i>发生什么事了？</i>
<i>What is going on?</i>

680
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,760
西蒙说  这是潜伏在他背后的敌人干的
Simon said,"This is my enemies behind this."

681

他很担心有人在跟踪他

682
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:51,800
他发来一条语音信息

683
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,199
<i>我想请你帮我一个忙</i>
<i>I want to ask you, uh, a favor.</i>

684
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:59,159
佩妮拉 我其实还挺不好意思找你帮忙
"Pernilla, I am really embarrassed to even ask you."

685
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,760
能麻烦你借我3万美元吗？
"Would it be possible for me to borrow $30,000?"

686
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,840
<i>这将会极大地帮到我</i>

<i>Please let me know if you can do something. Thank you so much.</i>

688
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,119
我没有3万的闲钱
I didn't have $30,000 to spare.

689
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:20,400

apartment where I'm supposed to live.

692
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,159
但我朋友的生命安全和买一间公寓
But, what is more important,

693
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,920
哪件事更重要呢？

694
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:43,016
<i>感谢你为我做的一切</i>
<i>Thank you for everything you've done...</i>

他真的很感激能有我这样值得信任的朋友
He's really grateful to have such a good friend as me that he really can trust.

697
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,039

和专业人士讨沟通更多细节
going through more details with the people that I had met.

那个保镖彼得
Peter, the bodyguard.

701
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,159
如果一切都是假的  那他也是骗局的其中一员？
If it wasn't real,then did he lie to me as well?

702
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:22,000
带着孩子的女人是谁？
Who is the woman with the kid?

703
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,000
西蒙的女儿哪来的？

704
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,760
我给美国运通写了封信

我想知道更多细节

他们让我搜索希蒙海尤特
They tell me to Google Shimon Hayut and that I will find some answers.

707
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,880
我找到一篇芬兰语的文章
There's an article in Finnish.

708
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,760
我用翻译软解翻译了它

709
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,400
一个专门诈骗女人的以色列千万富翁
Israeli multi-millionaire that cheated on women.

710
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:00,679
啥玩意？

711
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,360
早在2015年他就诈骗过三名芬兰女性
Back in 2015, he had been defrauding three Finnish women.

712
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,480

They don't give names. They are protected.

713
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,960
他对其中一位受害者说他在武器行业工作

714
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,079
他对另一个受害者说自己是以色列情报探员
To another woman,he said he was a Mossad agent.

715
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,559
他就是个疯子  进了监狱后变得更糟糕了
That's insane. He goes to prison.He becomes even worse.

716
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,800
他们放走了一个在谋划新犯罪事件的家伙
They let out a guy that has almost been,like, cooking up a new plan.

717
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,480
他会不停地犯罪

718
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,639
谁能阻止他？

719

我
I had to stop him.

720
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,239
我得联系挪威最大的媒体VG
I needed to go to the biggest newspaper in Norway, VG.

721
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:04,920
我祈祷他们会报道他的犯罪事件
I was just praying, you know,that they would take this on.

722
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:15,840
这是个不可置信的故事
This was really like an unbelievable story.

723
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,360
一个假装是拥有亿万家产钻石王老五的儿子的家伙
A guy who had pretended to be a son of a diamond billionaire.

724

Private jets, a luxury lifestyle. It, uh,sounds almost like a fairy tale or movie.

725
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,920
作为一名记者你首先要问的是
First thing you ask as a journalist is

726
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,719
你能提供任何证明资料吗？

727
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:37,119
毕竟不能发表未经证实的文章
You can't print it without documentation.

728
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,519
我打开之前的聊天软件
Of course, I have WhatsApp.

729
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,760
我想象着陌生人一点点地读我内心的想法、我的恐惧
I then imagine strangers reading through my inner thoughts, my fears,

730
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,920
还有我对这家伙的爱

731
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,599
这本是很私人的东西  还有床上的自拍照
It's super private. It's selfies in bed.

732

It's astounding.

739
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,039
就像是在解剖这段关系
It's like looking into the anatomy of the relationship.

740
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:22,639
我们可以一分钟一分钟地追踪这段关系的发展过程
We can follow how this developed minute by minute.

741

他真的很专业

742
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,800
初次约会
The first date was a good way

743
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,119
是诱使她相信他是成功人士的好办法
to lure her to believe that he was really successful.

744
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,880
这是一个情感骗局
This is an emotional con.

745
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:43,440
他承诺了很多
He was promising so much...

746
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,599
比如同居
an apartment together,

747
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,039
共同度假
vacations,

748
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,119
建立属于自己的甜蜜家庭
building a family together.

749
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:55,320
<i>我想请你帮我一个忙</i>
<i>I wanted to ask you a favor.</i>

750
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,360
他们约会了个把月后
The first request for money

751
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,239
他的第一个需求就是钱
comes after they've been dating for over a month.

752
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:06,000
他花费了一个月让她全身心爱上他
And he has been using that month to make her fall in love with him,

753
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:12,159
相信他是富豪  并恐惧他的敌人
prove that he is really rich, and make her afraid of his enemies.

754
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,360
没有理由不相信西蒙将会为她偿还贷款
There's no reason to believe that Simon is not able to pay her back,

755
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,119
因为她已经见过他的阔绰程度
because she has seen how wealthy he is.

756
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:23,320
西蒙被人群环绕着
Simon is surrounded by a lot of people,

757
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,400
尤其是他的保镖和商业伙伴
especially his bodyguard and his business partner.

758
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:33,440
我们不知道谁在和西蒙合作   也不知道这场阴谋到底到了什么程度
We don't know who is working with Simon and how far this conspiracy actually goes.

759
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:40,199
塞西莉也给我们发了这篇芬兰文章
Cecilie was also sending us this Finnish article.

760
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,480
希蒙海尤特和西蒙列维夫是同一个人吗？
Is Shimon Hayut and Simon Leviev the same guy?

761
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,079
我们与当局取得了联系
We all got in touch with the authorities

762
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,639
得知了15年三名受害者的名字
and found out the names of the three Finnish women.

763
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:02,000
我问塞西莉对这些名字有没有印象
I ask Cecilie, does she recognize the victims' names?

764
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:10,559
我搜索了她们的名字
I Google these women.

765
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,840
我一个也不认识
I don't recognize anyone.

766
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:30,400
然后一张非常熟悉的脸出现了
And then a face pops up that is very familiar.

767
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:37,280
我在私人飞机上见过她
It's the same woman that was on the jet with me.

768
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,199
那个抱着西蒙孩子的女人
The same woman that has a child with Simon.

769
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,239
你他爹的怎么可能是受害人？
How on the fucking Earth were you a victim?

770
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,280
你在2016年参加了审判
You were standing at the trial back in 2016.

771
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,239
把他送进了监狱
Putting him to jail,

772
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,800
明明知道他诈骗过你
knowing that he had lied to you,

773
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,480
结果三年过去你也成了西蒙的犯罪同伙
and suddenly, three years later, you're sitting on a private jet with Simon.

774
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:07,920
那些她在车里告诉我的事情
The things that she told me in that car

775
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,760
让我相信他真的是个很棒的人
made me really believe that he was a great guy.

776
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,960
她为什么不警告我？
Why didn't she warn me?

777
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,639
这真是非同寻常
That was extraordinary,

778
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:31,280
这让事情变得复杂  因为不知道谁还值得信任
and it made it hard because we didn't know who to trust.

779
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:40,920
但我们必须向警方证明
But we still had to prove to the police that Shimon Yehuda Hayut and Simon Leviev

780
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,280
希蒙耶胡达海尤特和西蒙列维夫是同一个人
was the same person.

781
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,440
起诉书上有他的出生日期
In the indictment,we have his date of birth.

782
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,079
当我们搜索希蒙海尤特时
So when we typed in "Shimon Hayut" in Google,

783
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,679
基本上没搜出来什么
that didn't give us much,basically nothing.

784
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,480
但西蒙列维夫和希蒙海尤特有一个共同点
But there's one thing that Simon Leviev and Shimon Hayut has in common.

785
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:04,960
他们都来自以色列
They're both from Israel.

786
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:11,199
我们需要一个懂希伯来语和了解以色列的人
We needed someone who knew Hebrew and knew the country of Israel.

787
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,480
所以我们联系了一名叫乌里的记者
So we contacted this journalist called Uri.

788
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,840
乌里找到了希蒙海尤特的最后一个已知地址   我们需要到以色列去
Uri finds out the last known address for Shimon Hayut. We need to go to Israel.

789
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,280
我们开车去市郊
We're driving towards the outskirts of the city,

790
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,360
看到了很多狭窄的街道
we see more narrow streets,

791
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,360
小型公寓  以及大量极端正统犹太人
smaller apartment buildings,and a lot of ultra-Orthodox Jews.

792
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,039
这和他社交软件上展现出的生活相比
This was the total opposite

793
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,760
是两个世界
of how he wanted to present his life in social media.

794
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:00,079
是这里吗？
Is it here?

795
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:01,920
停车吧
So let's park, uh...

796
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,360
-我请求他不要走得太远  -好的
- I asked him to stay very near. - Okay.

797
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,800
以防万一我们还能逃跑
In case we need to escape.

798
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,079
乌里、娜塔莉和我下车了
Uri, Natalie, and I go out.

799
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,639
我的工作是用摄像机记录下一切
My job is to be the cameraman that documents everything that happens.

800
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:18,719
就是这个名字
That's the name.

801
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,960
对  就这个
That's the name. This one.

802
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,280
嗯
Hmm.

803
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,760
上面说了什么？
What's it says?

804
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,639
这是给他的信
It's a letter for him.

805
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:43,320
-给希蒙的吗？  -是的  给希蒙海尤特的
- For Shimon?  - Shimon Hayut.

806
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,679
对  就这
Yeah, this one.

807
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,119
他可能还在这里
So he might actually be staying here.

808
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,719
这是当局寄来的信
So this is a letter from the authorities

809
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,679
当你欠钱时他们会向你要账
that ask money back from people when you owe money.

810
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,320
明白了
Oh, okay.

811
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
你好
Hello.

812
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:06,159
你是谁？
Who are you?

813
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:07,760
我们是记者
We're journalists.

814
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,239
我们想找西蒙
We're looking for Simon.

815
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,480
那是谁？
Who is it?

816
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:14,920
-你不应该来这  -没事的  妈妈  让他们进来吧
- You are not allowed to be here.- But, Mom, come in.

817
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,440
请问您是西蒙的妈妈吗？
So, you're Simon's mother.

818
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:19,079
-他在哪里？-他在哪里？
- Where is he? - Where is he?

819
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:21,400
你在找他是吧  我也在找他
You're looking for him,I'm looking for him.

820
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:26,199
他在挪威诈骗了一名女性25万美元
He's swindled a woman in Norway for a quarter of a million dollars.

821
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,679
显然我也联系不到他  对于他我无可奉告
I have absolutely no contact with him.I have nothing to do with him.

822
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,599
从他18岁开始我就跟他断联了
I've not had contact with him since he was 18 years old.

823
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:38,239
-但他登记的地址是这里   -他改名换地了
- But his registered address is here.- He changed his name and address.

824
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,159
他早就不姓海尤特了
He is not Hayut anymore.

825
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,800
-那他姓什么？ -列维夫
- So who is he? - Leviev.

826
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,320
走吧
Let's go.

827
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,880
为了证实西蒙和希蒙是同一个人
To confirm that Simon and Shimon was the same person,

828
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,039
我们需要拜访当地警局
we need to see the local police.

829
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:56,480
你对他的长相有印象吗？
Is this face familiar to you?

830
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,079
有的
Yes.

831
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:07,920
他在2017年把姓名改成了西蒙列维夫
In 2017, he changed his name to Simon Leviev.

832
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,480
在那之前他一直都叫希蒙海尤特
Before that, he was known as Shimon Hayut.

833
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,480
警察证实了
The police confirmed

834
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,239
西蒙列维夫和希蒙海尤特是同一个人
that Simon Leviev and Shimon Hayut

835
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,280
也就是那个15年在芬兰犯诈骗罪的人
is the same guy convicted in Finland.

836
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,599
他用过很多名字
He uses many names.

837
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:27,760
他从十几岁起就是个诈骗犯
He has been a fraudster since his late teens.

838
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,119
拼图被一片片拼凑出来
You start to piece together some more of the puzzle.

839
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:45,000
早在2011年西蒙被怀疑偷了雇主的支票
Back in 2011, Simon was suspected of stealing a check from his employer.

840
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:51,159
并开始偷窃其他支票并伪造支票
He moves on to other stolen checks and forged checks.

841
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,480
西蒙本应出席法庭  但他逃离了这个国家
Simon was supposed to meet in court, but he fled the country.

842
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,039
他离开了以色列
But then he left Israel.

843
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:02,440
他伪造了护照  远走高飞
He forged a passport and left the country.

844
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:05,039
所以他现在是通缉犯？
So he's wanted by the police?

845
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,119
没错
Yes.

846
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,360
以色列当局要求找到他
The Israeli authorities demand that he be found

847
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:16,000
以继续对他的审判
so the trial against him can continue.

848
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,960
我们尽可能地寻找他  好让他进监狱
And we're doing what we can to find him and bring him in.

849
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,039
在以色列之行后
We got a lot of new and really good information

850
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:25,599
我们获取了大量新的、有用的信息
after the trip to Israel,

851
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,679
但我们仍然不知道他在哪
but we don't know where he is right now.

852
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,920
我会随时通知你的
Well, I will keep you posted.

853
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,239
每个人都拿到了自己那份钱  你也会的
Everybody else got their money, so you should too.

854
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,599
我会给银行打电话看看发生什么事了  
I will see what's going on.I will call the bank.

855
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:44,239
爱你  拜拜
Love you. Miss you. Bye-bye.

856
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:50,800
他真诚地表达歉意  并表示需要再借一点
He really apologizes and says that he needs to borrow a little bit more.

857
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,639
我说  西蒙  你应该在一两周后
I told him, "Simon, you were supposed to transfer back this money you borrowed

858
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,119
尽快还钱
a week or two after."

859
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:58,639
你确定一切顺利？
"Are you sure everything is gonna be okay?"

860
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:01,280
他说是的
He's like,"Yeah, everything is gonna be okay."

861
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,559
于是我又给他转了1万美元
So I transfer him another $10,000.

862
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:09,679
<i>我向你保证我下周一定还钱</i>
<i>I guarantee you I will make payment next week.</i>

863
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:20,159
第二周他给我发了一张10万美元的银行收据
The next week,he texts me a bank receipt for $100,000.

864
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,440
西蒙又变回阔绰的样子  他现在只欠我4万美元了
Simon is being very generous.He only owes me 40,000.

865
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,159
<i>认真的吗  西蒙你太棒了</i>
<i>Oh, seriously, Simon,that is so nice of you.</i>

866
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:34,039
<i>感激不尽</i>
<i>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you so, so much.</i>

867
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:35,400
亲亲
Kisses.

868
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,360
<i>尽管那些时刻如此艰难</i>
<i>Through the most difficult moments,</i>

869
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,719
<i>你也一直陪伴我</i>
<i>you have been there for me.</i>

870
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:42,480
<i>我打心底里感谢你</i>
<i>So that's why I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart.</i>

871
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,679
但钱款迟迟没有到账
And then the money just don't arrive.

872
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,119
<i> 很不幸的是银行希望我亲自到那去一趟</i>
<i>Unfortunately,the bank want me there physically</i>

873
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:55,280
<i>并让我的律师签署一些文件</i>
<i>with my lawyer to sign some few other papers.</i>

874
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,920
<i>我要去那里让事情回到正轨  我能请你帮个忙吗？</i>
<i>I need to fly and I need to fix it up.I want to ask you a favor.</i>

875
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,760
我用自己的运通卡为他的机票买了单
So I pay for these flights on my American Express card.

876
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,280
<i> 钱已经从我们的银行账户出去了</i>
<i>The money has left our bank account</i>

877
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,280
<i>所以你无需担心</i>
<i>so you have nothing to worry about.</i>

878
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,840
他又让我为他的其他机票买单
He asked me to help him with another flight.

879
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,680
一张又一张
And then another flight,and then another flight.

880
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,520
但随着时间流逝  我并没有收到应收的钱款
So with time just passing,money doesn't come in.

881
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,840
<i> 我刚才在银行   他们查询不到任何转账记录</i>
<i>I was just at the bank and they can't find any transfer.</i>

882
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,079
<i>但我必须要支付自己的账单了  我现在很担心</i>
<i>And that I need to pay my bills.I'm really freaking out.</i>

883
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:34,439
<i> 我惹了很多麻烦  现在很恐慌  </i>
<i>I'm panicking. Like, I got myself in so, so much trouble right now.</i>

884
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,640
<i>他们冻结了我的账户</i>
<i>They put a stop on my account.</i>

885
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:41,640
<i>我可以给你一块手表</i>
<i>Of course I can give you one of my watches.</i>

886
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,159
<i>我有块手表价值超过10万</i>
<i>I have a watch worth over 100K.</i>

887
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,319
他告诉我他会帮我预定一张到他那去的机票
So he tells me he will book me a flight to wherever he is

888
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,680
让我几天内能拿到手表
within a couple of days to collect the watch.

889
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,680
我们有如此多的新消息  但仍然找不到他
We have a lot of new information,but we still haven't found him.

890
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,960
所以现在应该回头研究当初塞西莉发来的的资料
So what we have to do is go back into the documentation we got from Cecilie.

891
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,640
塞西莉用她的美国运通卡做了很多交易
Cecilie gave us a lot of transactions done with her Amex card.

892
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,880
我们在其中看到了机票购买记录
In these transactions, we see flight tickets.

893
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:30,960
那里也有其他名字
There are also names.

894
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,199
比如事业伙伴
The business partner.

895
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,920
保镖
The bodyguard.

896
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,199
我们还看到了其他女性的名字
But we could also find names of different women.

897
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,079
其中一个叫佩妮拉斯霍姆
So one of the names is Pernilla Sjoholm.

898
01:09:55,079 --> 01:10:00,000
我在脸书上找到了佩妮拉的账号并给她发了私信
So I find Pernilla on Facebook and write a message to her.

899
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,159
我慌了
I... panic.

900
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:26,880
差点昏过去
I thought I was gonna pass out.

901
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,800
我把信息直接转发给西蒙
I forward the message straight over to Simon.

902
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,199
<i>我不会...</i>
<i>I would not...</i>

903
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:39,920
他让我不必担心
He says I shouldn't worry,

904
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,840
这只是他的敌人的小伎俩
that this is his enemies trying to get information.

905
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,439
他安慰我让我冷静下来  在挂断电话后
He really tries to calm me down and even just, like, after hanging up the phone,

906
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,960
我逐渐意识到这不可能是编造的
I'm starting to realize, like,this can't be made up.

907
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:55,880
电话响了  是厄伦德
My phone rings. It is Erlend.

908
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,640
我问她   我能来斯德哥尔摩和你面谈吗？
So I asked her, "Can I come to Stockholm to meet you to talk through your story?"

909
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,600
我坐飞机去了那里   并在第二天会面
I get on a plane.We were meeting up the next day.

910
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,279
他把一切都告诉了我
He tells me everything.

911
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,000
我非常气愤  西蒙怎么能这样对我？
I am furious.Why would Simon do this to me?

912
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,640
他是我很在乎、很爱的朋友
This was a friend who I really cared about, who I loved.

913
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:25,439
他真的凭空创造出了一个我会喜欢
He really created this person that I would like,

914
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:29,119
会成为我真正的好朋友的人
someone who would be a really good friend.

915
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:37,359
所以如果他不仅仅是通过爱情来诈骗
So, if it's not only through romantic relationships that he's pursuing scams,

916
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:39,039
还有什么其他手段呢？
what else could there be?

917
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,760
我告诉了厄伦德
I tell Erlend about all the travels

918
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,680
关于西蒙的旅行以及他挥霍金钱的夸张程度
and the amount of money he has been spending,

919
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,880
还有所有我遇到的人
and all the other people that I have met.

920
01:11:54,439 --> 01:11:57,800
当他告诉我有关于那个挪威女孩的事情时
When he tells me about this Norwegian girl,

921
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,600
我意识到西蒙从她那诈骗的钱
I'm starting to realize that the amount of money she has lost

922
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,119
不足以支付他的奢侈生活
doesn't add up to the lifestyle that he's been living,

923
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:08,760
因为被花掉的金额过于高昂
because there is an extreme amount of money that has been spent.

924
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,279
这肯定只是冰山一角
This must just be the tip of the iceberg.

925
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:19,920
在查看了佩妮拉的银行账户后  我意识到这可能是一个庞氏骗局
After looking at Pernilla's bank accounts,I realize this may be a Ponzi scheme.

926
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,600
他在佩妮拉的身上用塞西莉的钱
He uses Cecilie's money on Pernilla,

927
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,479
又在其他人身上用佩妮拉的钱
and he uses Pernilla's money on somebody else.

928
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:39,880
他永远不用自己的信用卡  所以他有合理的借口
It's never his name on the credit card, so he has plausible excuse.

929
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,119
他永远都会说  我只是借点钱
He can always say,"I was just borrowing the money."

930
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,319
这简直是完美骗局
It's almost like the perfect scam.

931
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,720
通过花费上一个受害者的信用卡
Of course, by using one woman's credit card

932
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,079
为下一个受害者买机票   带下下个受害者吃大餐
to buy plane tickets to a second woman and to buy a dinner to a third,

933
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:03,079
他当然能够四处旅游  而且永远不会在同一个城市停留过长时间
he was able to travel a lot,and he never stayed long in one place.

934
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,960
这使得预算较低的地方警察很难追捕一个
That made it very hard for local police authorities with low budgets

935
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:14,079
对当地来说只能算是小骗子的人
to go after a man that,in their world, was like a small scam.

936
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,039
我们点了所有的菜
Hey, we order all the menu.

937
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:20,239
我问佩妮拉   你能告诉我他在哪吗？
I ask Pernilla,"Can you tell me where he is?"

938
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,399
我不仅仅知道他在哪
I don't just only know where he is.

939
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:28,159
我明天还要去见他呢
I am booked on a flight to go and see him tomorrow.

940
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:29,600
他在慕尼黑
He's in Munich.

941
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,039
我们需要在10小时内赶到慕尼黑
In less than 10 hours, we need to be in Munich.

942
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:49,159
我们在慕尼黑的目标是拍摄他
Our goal in Munich was to film him

943
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:52,840
以向警方证明有机会找到他
to prove to the police that he was possible to find.

944
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,600
我们真的很专心
You're really focused.

945
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,640
因为你知道你只有一次机会逮到他
You know you have this one chance to get what you want.

946
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,760
你也要对佩妮拉负责
Also you have responsibility for Pernilla.

947
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,520
西蒙绝对不知道他们在那里   也不知道我干的事情
Simon can absolutely not find out that they are there or that I have done this,

948
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,960
如果他发现我背着他做的事情
because I don't know if it's dangerous for me

949
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:16,960
我也不知道这会不会给我带来危险
if he does find out that I'm doing this behind his back.

950
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:21,760
我要去破坏他的美好生活
I'm going in there trying to sabotage his fabulous life.

951
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,720
这个计划是为了保持安全距离
The plan is to keep a safe distance,

952
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,119
为了做到这一点  娜塔莉要追踪佩妮拉的手机定位
and to do that, Natalie is tracking Pernilla's where abouts on the iPhone.

953
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,960
以防西蒙查看佩妮拉的手机
In case Simon should look at Pernilla's phone,

954
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,079
佩妮拉用另一个名字存了我的电话号码
Pernilla saves my number as a different name.

955
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:39,119
这使得佩妮拉能一直和我保持联系
That makes it possible for Pernilla to have constant contact with me.

956
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,720
她说她刚刚着陆
She writes that she's just landed.

957
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,560
我们的摄影师在机场外等着准备拍照
We have a photographer outside the airport who may be able to get pictures.

958
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,239
她发来  我的朋友会接我
She writes, "My friend is picking me up."

959
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:55,880
那肯定就是西蒙
That must be Simon.

960
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:00,640
现在我们从摄影师那收到了照片
I've now received a picture from the photographer.

961
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:08,359
他在慕尼黑
Wow, he's in Munich.

962
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:10,720
我的心砰砰直跳
My heart is pounding.

963
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:14,880
这是我第一次看到他的合作伙伴  阿维谢
This is the first time I meet his business partner, Avishay,

964
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,000
他曾经告诉我许多关于这个人的事情
that he had told me so much about.

965
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:21,800
我开始有些恐慌
I'm starting to become very, very paranoid

966
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,359
因为我不知道车里的人的真实身份
because who am I in the car with?Who are they really?

967
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,199
我看着他  想起他曾经编造的那些谎言  估计阿维谢也是谎言的一环
I'm looking at him, and I know the truth,like everything that he has done.

968
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,880
他对我来说再也不算是朋友了
These former feelings that I had that this was my friend just got erased.

969
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,159
我从来没这么恨过一个人
I don't think I ever hated a person my entire life

970
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:47,439
直到我坐进车里
until that second when I was sitting in that car

971
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,840
看到他的那一瞬间
and just looking at him.

972
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,000
佩妮拉给我发了短信
Pernilla texted me

973
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:56,640
他们要去文华东方酒店
that they were going to Mandarin Oriental Hotel.

974
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,279
那是家内设餐厅的豪华酒店
That's a fancy hotel with a restaurant inside.

975
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:02,239
好的
Okay.

976
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,079
我在那最重要的工作
The most important job I had in there

977
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:08,600
就是给克里斯托弗发消息并继续拍摄
was to text Kristoffer and the still photographer

978
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,439
无论他们何时离开餐厅
whenever they were leaving the restaurant.

979
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,439
对面有一个停车场
Opposite,there's a parking garage.

980
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,600
就在墙上的缝隙后面
Just behind gaps in the wall,

981
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,960
我们可以在那安置相机并拍摄西蒙离开的画面
we can place our lenses to capture Simon as he walks out.

982
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:28,199
每个人都认识他  会对他说  欢迎再次光临  列维夫先生
Everyone knew about him."Welcome back, Mr. Leviev."

983
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:30,319
看到这一幕真让我生气
And that gets me going.

984
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,880
你在慕尼黑又干了什么？你又祸害了多少人？
What have you been doing in Munich? How many victims are here?

985
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,199
他说他因为钱的事很抱歉
He tells me he's sorry about the situation with the money

986
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:40,840
然后把表给我了
and he gives me the watch.

987
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,760
他点了菜单上的所有菜
He orders everything on the menu,

988
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,479
当我们享用晚餐时我感到非常不爽
and I feel so bad even sitting there when we're having this dinner,

989
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,039
因为我脑子里只能想到一件事
'cause the only thing that goes in my head is,

990
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:53,640
谁为这顿晚餐买单？
"Who's paying for this dinner?"

991
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:58,560
我们一直在等娜塔莉发消息过来
We're just waiting and waiting for a text from Natalie.

992
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,640
西蒙看向我们所在的方向  我们赶紧躲起来
Simon looks in our direction, and we hide.

993
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,800
西蒙开始讲希伯来语  他俩看起来非常不安
Simon starts speaking in Hebrew and getting very upset to Avishay.

994
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,479
我问发生什么事了？
And I'm like, "What's going on?"

995
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,239
他们说  那边有个偷拍的家伙
And they were like,"There's a camera guy over there."

996
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:38,399
然后他开始叫喊  快进车里！
And he started screaming, like,"Get into the car!"

997
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,680
一路开车狂飙穿过了慕尼黑
Driving around so fast through Munich.

998
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:56,079
我听不懂他们在说什么  他们知道是我把他们摆了一道吗？
I don't know what they're saying. Do they know that I have set them up to do this?

999
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,720
他们会对我做什么？
What are they really gonna do with me?

1000
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:05,399
他们会不会说  佩妮拉  这是你这辈子干的最大的一件事
Just think, like, "Pernilla, you play your biggest act you have ever done

1001
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:08,600
因为你这辈子就到此为止了
your entire life, because otherwise you are never coming home."

1002
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,079
我试图扭转情况
I'm trying to twist everything around.

1003
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,279
我朝他尖叫  那是你的敌人吗？他们现在在追杀我吗？西蒙？
I'm screaming at him, like, "Is this your enemies? Are they after me now, Simon?"

1004
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:22,239
他试图稳住局面  他说  不  那些人在追杀他
He's trying to calm down the situation,like, "No, it's me they're after."

1005
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:25,600
我说  快让我下车
I'm telling him, "Just drop me off."

1006
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,159
我这辈子从来没这么快地开过车门
I never opened a car door as fast in my entire life.

1007
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:41,680
我们很担心佩妮拉
We were very concerned about Pernilla.

1008
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,319
我们意识到我们没办法在那里与他对质
We realized we wouldn't be able to confront him there.

1009
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:50,840
我们得回奥斯陆  研究下一步该怎么走
We need to go back to Oslo and work out our next step.

1010
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,439
我把手表拿到当铺
I take the watch to a pawn shop,

1011
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,880
他们告诉我这是块假表
and they tell me it is fake.

1012
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:05,239
我猜到了  毕竟他身上没有真东西
Of course it is,because nothing about him is real.

1013
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:09,880
我真的很想跟他对质以获取真相
I really want to confront him and at least tell me the truth.

1014
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:14,239
你总是想从每个人身上得知真相
That's what you want from all people. Just tell me the truth, how it is.

1015
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,600
佩妮拉真的很想跟他对话
Pernilla really wants to talk to him,

1016
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,199
我们记录了全程
and we are filming that call.

1017
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:23,279
你好
Hello.

1018
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,199
<i>嗨  你还好吗  早安</i>
<i>Hey, what's up? Good morning.</i>

1019
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:26,119
早上好
Morning.

1020
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:27,319
<i>中午好  我很抱歉</i>
<i>Good afternoon. Sorry.</i>

1021
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,199
没事  你这会儿在干什么？
It's okay. What are you doing?

1022
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:31,399
<i>挺好的  你呢</i>
<i>I'm all right, and you?</i>

1023
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
嗯
Um...

1024
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:35,800
我一点也不好  西蒙
I'm not so good, Simon.

1025
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:38,079
<i>怎么了？</i>
<i>What is it?</i>

1026
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,199
你能告诉我真相吗？
Can you just tell me the truth?

1027
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,199
<i>我已经告诉过你了</i>
<i>I told you the truth.</i>

1028
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,279
你从来都没有
No, you haven't told me the truth.

1029
01:19:44,359 --> 01:19:47,199
你能告诉我全部真相吗？我有资格知道
Can you give me the entire truth? At least I deserve that.

1030
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,760
<i>可是我告诉过你了  我不理解这是...</i>
<i>I told you the entire truth,I don't understand what is the...</i>

1031
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,199
西蒙  我失去了一切
Simon. Simon, I lost everything I have.

1032
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:56,960
你能至少告诉我一次真相吗
Can you please tell me the truth for once. It's a little...

1033
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:02,399
<i>佩妮拉你不懂  我的敌人尝试...</i>
<i>Pernilla, you have no idea.My enemies are trying to...</i>

1034
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:07,479
西蒙！ 听我说  我已经全部都知道了
Simon! Simon! Simon!Simon, listen to me. I know.

1035
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:09,239
<i>知道什么？</i>
<i>What do you know?</i>

1036
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:10,159
我知道...
I know about...

1037
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,880
<i>知道我不知道的？</i>
<i>Something that I don't know?</i>

1038
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,000
<i>你到底知道什么？</i>
<i>What do you know?</i>

1039
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:15,079
我得知了一切  西蒙
I know everything. Simon, I know...

1040
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:19,359
我知道你设下的骗局  我知道你在芬兰蹲过监狱
I know you're doing this fraud thing.I know you've been in jail in Finland.

1041
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:20,279
我知道你是个...
I know you're...

1042
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:22,760
<i>你他爹的到底在说什么？</i>
<i>What the fuck is this bullshit?</i>

1043
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,279
我知道你还骗了其他人
I know about the other people that you have frauded.

1044
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:27,159
<i>你竟然骗我</i>
<i>You double-cross me...</i>

1045
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,520
<i>我现在告诉你</i>
<i>I can tell you right now,</i>

1046
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,920
<i>你将用余生为此付出代价</i>
<i>you will pay for this for the rest of your life.</i>

1047
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,319
我正在用余生付出代价  你夺走了我的一切
I am paying for the rest of my life.You took everything I have.

1048
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:40,520
<i>这是你自己的错  如果你想指控我</i>
<i>This is your mistake. If you want to make some claims against me,</i>

1049
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,359
<i>那就有本事给出对我不利的证据</i>
<i>give me the evidence you have against me.</i>

1050
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:46,520
以色列警方已经用你的照片指认了你
The Israeli police have confirmed you with your picture.

1051
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:49,199
<i>没人指认任何事情  你在撒谎</i>
<i>Nobody has confirmed anything.That's not true.</i>

1052
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:50,159
是的
Yes.

1053
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,079
我有一趟去阿姆斯特丹的航班  对吗
I had a flight to Amsterdam, right?

1054
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,760
<i>对</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

1055
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,000
谁付的钱？
Yeah, who paid for that?

1056
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,359
<i>我自己！</i>
<i>I paid for it!</i>

1057
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:57,319
不是你
No, you didn't.

1058
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:01,479
机票的交易记录表明这是另一位女性付的钱
I have the transaction for the ticket,and it's paid by another woman.

1059
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,960
<i>因为敌人我没办法用自己的...</i>
<i>Because of my enemies I couldn't use my own...</i>

1060
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:06,119
<i>但我用现金偿还他们</i>
<i>I have paid these people in cash.</i>

1061
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:07,439
<i>我确实给了他们钱</i>
<i>I did give them money.</i>

1062
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,760
西蒙  你不能再继续这么干了
Simon, you can't keep doing this.

1063
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,880
这太疯狂了
Like, it's crazy.

1064
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,560
<i>亲爱的  那你做的一切又是为了什么？</i>
<i>Honey, what have you done this all for?</i>

1065
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,520
<i>一切都是有代价的  我保证这比你花费的金钱还要高</i>
<i>There will be a price,and I promise it'll be bigger than money.</i>

1066
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,199
你说代价是什么意思？
What do you mean, the price?

1067
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,600
<i>你骗我 你将为此付出代价</i>
<i>You double-cross me,you're gonna pay for it.</i>

1068
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:30,319
我吓坏了  我都做了什么？
I really got scared,because what have I done?

1069
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,279
我们唯一能做的事情就是让VG增加事件热度
The only thing that we can do is to make the VG piece as big as possible

1070
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,800
好逼他露面
to get his face out there,

1071
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,800
因为如果民众知道他的真实身份与长相
because if people would know who he is and recognize his face,

1072
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,079
就不会被他诈骗了
he can't do this anymore.

1073
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,680
提供这样的故事需要很大的勇气
Coming forward with a story like this takes a lot of courage.

1074
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:55,319
我感到很焦虑  因为VG是挪威最大的报纸
I was feeling anxious, you know.VG is the biggest newspaper in Norway.

1075
01:21:55,399 --> 01:21:57,880
我的脸会出现在头条版面
Like, my face would be on the front cover.

1076
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,279
将会有一个大型在线特别节目
There would be this big online special.

1077
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,079
我知道人们会审判我  我得为此做好准备
I know that people were gonna judge me.Am I ready?

1078
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:10,239
你的人生从此会走上不同轨道
Your entire life is never gonna be the same again.

1079
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:23,239
这一切就像熊熊燃烧的野火  像是深夜的噩梦
Everything just, like, went wildfire.It felt like a nightmare.

1080
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:29,159
社会媒体是残忍的  他们会生生吃掉你
Social media is brutal, you know.They'll eat you alive.

1081
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:33,159
人们会骂你是个拜金女  说你活该
People are saying what a gold digger you are or, "She deserved this."

1082
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:36,520
可拜金女永远不会自己掏钱
A gold digger would never give out a penny.

1083
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,439
我真的不理解为什么总会有人责怪受害者
I never understood this,how you can blame a victim.

1084
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:46,279
我所做的只是为了帮助他人
All I did was just trying to help people.

1085
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:49,680
我不希望有人受伤
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

1086
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,560
但我很乐于看到人们发表善意的评论
But it was kind of nice to just see

1087
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,199
并关注这些积极向上的东西
and try to focus on the positive things that people were writing.

1088
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:09,880
我看到无数大家分享的故事
I could see the amount of shares.

1089
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:12,520
各种各样的评论
Comment after comment after comment.

1090
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,119
看看这个  简直疯了
"Look at this story," you know."It's just insane."

1091
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,199
我们只是坐着  看到热度正在狂增
We were sitting there watching the numbers go up and up.

1092
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:27,319
每个人都想看《诈骗王》 这个故事在不断地传播开来
Everybody wanted to read
<i>The Tinder Swindler. </i>It was going viral.

1093
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,840
这就是我想要的效果  他的脸和他的名字不断出现在公众视野
This is what I wanted.His face is there. His name is there.

1094
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,800
无论他遇见谁  只要他介绍自己是西蒙列维夫
No matter who he meets and he says,"Hi. My name is Simon Leviev,"

1095
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,680
别人一搜索就知道他的狗屎事了
the moment they Google him now,it will be there.

1096
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,640
我遇到了佩妮拉  我们很快就有了感应
I met Pernilla.Immediately, we had a bond.

1097
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:53,159
这是唯一一个真正理解我的遭遇的人
This is the only person who really understands what I am going through.

1098
01:23:54,359 --> 01:23:56,479
我们想保持良好势头
We wanted to keep the momentum up.

1099
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,239
我们联手了
We joined forces.

1100
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:01,439
我们俩有了目标
Both of us had a goal that this needed to come out

1101
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,359
需要让更多国家的新闻杂志报导此事件
in as many newspapers in as many countries as possible.

1102
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:06,800
<i>-你好  -嗨</i>
<i>- Hello.- Hi.</i>

1103
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:09,720
首先我想表达歉意
First of all,I wanted to apologize

1104
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:14,920
想让你们知道  并不是所有的以色列男人都是这样的骗子
and let you know that not all Israeli men are such crooks.

1105
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,520
美国、英国、荷兰和德国的脱口秀节目和通讯社都在报道这件事
Talk shows and news agencies in the US,UK, Netherlands, Germany as well.

1106
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:24,880
我们需要更多曝光量  需要更多国家在他们内部进行调查
We needed more exposure and more countries to make their own investigations.

1107
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,159
比如  他在我们国家干了什么？这里也有他的受害者吗？
Like, "What did he do in our country?Do we have any victims here?"

1108
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,359
另一件事是让警察真正感受到
But another thing was to actually get the police

1109
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:35,439
来自媒体和公众的压力
to feel the pressure from the media,the pressure from the public,

1110
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,960
并付出实际行动着手调查
and do something about this.

1111
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,840
公众回应超出了我们的预计
The response was really overwhelming.

1112
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,399
世界各地的受害者联系到我们
We were contacted by victims all over the world.

1113
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,479
<i> 2015年的时候我在Tinder上刷到他  然后在哥本哈根见面...</i>
<i>I met him on Tinder in 2015.we met up Copenhagen...</i>

<i>- His name was Mordechay Tapiro.- His name was Simon Leviev.</i>

<i>我和我的妻子雇佣西蒙当我们五岁儿子的看护</i>
<i>My wife and I hired Simon to babysit our five-year-old son.</i>

1119
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,199
<i>他那时20岁</i>
<i>He was 20 years old at the time.</i>

1120
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:14,439
<i> 我们知道他的父亲是一位犹太教经师  他来自一个非常...</i>
<i>We knew that his father was a rabbi and he came from a very...</i>

1121
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,655
<i> 他告诉我他是一家以色列航空公司的继承人</i>
<i>He told me he was heir to an Israeli airline.</i>

1122

<i> 他租了很多昂贵的车</i>

<i>He told me that he was a Mossad agent</i>

1127
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,560
<i>伪装成飞行员当卧底</i>

<i>I'm still not over it,six years later.</i>

1133
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,279
<i>我很害怕他</i>

我们得到了所有这些信息
We got all this information,

1135
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,199
但他依然逍遥法外
but nothing happened to him.

1136
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:06,319
他依然在行骗  在监狱的高墙外肆意犯罪
He was still on the run,he was still a free man,

1137
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:09,920
尽管我们知道他被举报给了
even though we knew that he was reported to the police

1138
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,479
至少七个不同的国家

1139
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:23,000
我当时在布拉格机场

1140
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:26,119
拜访我的男朋友

1141
01:26:26,199 --> 01:26:29,319
在等待飞机起飞时
While I was waiting for my plane to leave,

1142
01:26:29,399 --> 01:26:35,760
我在Instagram上看到了我男朋友的照片

我点了进去

1144
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:40,760
"诈骗王"?
"The Tinder Swindler"?

1145
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:43,439
这啥玩意？
What the fuck is this?

1146
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,479
我完全震惊了

1147
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:52,119
我把新闻发给西蒙  他打来电话
I sent the article to Simon,and he started calling me.

1148
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:55,119
我们即将起飞
We were about to take off,

1149
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:59,600
所以我下载了这篇新闻并把手机设为了飞行模式
so I downloaded the article and put my phone on airplane mode.

1150
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:07,039
我看见那个在Tinder上遇见他的女孩塞西莉
I saw that this girl Cecilie met him on Tinder.

1151
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:09,279
我也是在Tinder上遇见他的
I also met him on Tinder.

1152
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:14,640
他也在第一次约会就带我去了五星酒店
He also took me to a five-star hotel on the first date.

1153
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,640
我跟他约会了差不多14个月
I was already dating Simon for 14 months.

1154
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:30,479
我认为这是一段很认真的关系

1155
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,560
我如此爱他

1158
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:51,399
我们开始讨论如何安定下来  建立家庭

1159
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,800
我感觉我们对彼此来说都很重要
I really felt we were meant for each other.

1160
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,880
我不断地往下滑动  看到了那些视频
I was scrolling through the article.I saw these videos coming up.

1161
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,119
塞西莉  我的爱人  我等不及要见你了
Cecilie, my love, I love you.I miss you. I can't wait to see you.

1162
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,319
他也给我发过一模一样的视频
He sent me the same video.

1163
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:16,680
艾琳 亲爱的

1164
01:28:18,039 --> 01:28:19,039
我想你
I miss you.

1165
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:20,079
彼得
Peter.

1166
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:25,960
我打开我的Whats聊天历史开始比较聊天记录
I went through my WhatsApp history,and I started to compare.

1167
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,680
他的确给她发过对我说过的话
He was sending exactly the same words to her as he did to me.

1168
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:36,319
早上好  我爱你  你还好吗？ 我很想你
"Good morning, love. How are you?I love you. I miss you."

1169
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:37,880
想和你一起生孩子
"I wanna have babies with you."

1170
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,760
他带塞西莉去了阿姆斯特丹  也就是我的家乡
He took Cecilie to Amsterdam, my hometown.

1171
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:47,359
那段时间我正在跟他约会
Exactly the same period as we were dating,

1172
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:52,479
她在伦敦为他们未来的生活看房子
she was looking for houses to start living with him in London.

1173
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,800
我也在阿姆斯特丹为我们的未来看房子
I was also looking for houses in Amsterdam.

1174
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:02,520
在同一天他因为商业事务飞到了奥斯陆
The same day, he was flying to Oslo for a business trip,

1175
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,039
他正要出去看她
he was just going out to see her.

1176
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:10,199
同时还给我发短信  "我累成狗了"  呵呵是啊
He texted me, "I'm tired as fuck."Yeah, of course.

1177
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:13,359
他一整晚都跟塞西莉在一起
He was with Cecilie all night.

1178
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:18,760
他告诉我他在慕尼黑的单子出问题了
He told me that this business deal in Munich went wrong.

1179
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:23,199
但那时他其实在跟佩妮拉见面
But he was meeting Pernilla.

1180
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,239
<i>彼得中伤了！</i>
<i>Peter is down!</i>

1181
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:32,359
他也给我发过这张照片
He sent exactly the same pictures to me,

1182
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,800
说他的敌人把彼得打惨了
telling me that his enemies had beaten Peter up.

1183
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,600
收到照片时我很害怕
When I got those pictures, I was terrified.

1184
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,520
这让我变得多疑  不停地回头看
It made me paranoid,constantly looking over my shoulder.

1185
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:53,520
几年前我被两个家伙跟踪  他们打了我
A few years ago, I was followed by two guys and they beat me up.

1186
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,199
我给西蒙说了这件事
I told Simon about this.

1187
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:03,399
当西蒙说我被跟踪了  我非常焦虑
When Simon said I was being followed,I was full of anxiety all the time.

1188
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,119
文章说他是个逃犯
I'm reading that he is a fugitive.

1189
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,840
一个被判有罪的罪犯
A convicted criminal.

1190
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:17,880
他从女性身上诈骗了几百万
He swindled women for millions.

1191
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,680
我几乎要心脏骤停  因为我也借了他钱
My heart almost stopped beating,because I also lent him money.

1192
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,560
一开始还只是小钱
It started off small.

1193
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:38,000
后来他说他的敌人在追踪他的手机  让我去买一些SIM卡
His enemies were tracking his phones,so he asked me to get some SIM cards.

1194
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,039
所以我在付那些账单
So I was paying off those bills.

1195
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:43,840
然后他索要的越来越多
But it became more and more and more.

1196
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:50,119
我给了他14万美元  如此巨款
I gave him $140,000. So much money.

1197
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:58,199
品牌时装、为其他女人订的机票、奢侈晚餐
Designer clothes, flight tickets for other women. Fancy dinners.

1198
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:03,600
现在我懂了  我的钱基本上等于喂狗了
Now I see,my money he spent on basically bullshit.

1199
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,359
我一时间悲愤交加
I had so many emotions.

1200
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:12,520
他出轨、还向我要钱
The cheating part, the money part.

1201
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,199
在这架小小的飞机上  我失去了一切
On one small flight, I lost everything.

1202
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,560
我不希望飞机降落
I didn't want the plane to land,

1203
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:27,840
那样的话我就会被迫面对屎一样的现实
because I needed to face reality,and that reality was terrifying.

1204
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:36,560
我一落地到阿姆斯特丹  他就给我打电话了
The moment I land in Amsterdam,I knew he would call me.

1205
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,159
<i>...一趟愉悦的航班</i>
<i>...an enjoyable flight.</i>

1206
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,840
<i>感谢您与我们一起飞行  并度过了一个愉快的夜晚</i>
<i>Thank you for flying with us,and have a pleasant evening.</i>

1207
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,239
<i>我不知道这篇垃圾是哪来的</i>
<i>I mean, I don't know where this shit came from.</i>

1208
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:00,840
他说新闻是假的
He says the article was fake.

1209
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:05,079
他的敌人花钱雇佣塞西莉和佩妮拉
Cecilie and Pernilla would have been paid by his enemies

1210
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:07,239
捏造假新闻
to create this article.

1211
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,520
我知道我被骗了  他才是假的
I knew I was defrauded.I knew that he was fake.

1212
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,439
<i>我爱你  我真的很在意你...</i>
<i>I love you. I care about you...</i>

1213
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,319
我报了警
I talked to the police.

1214
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:26,239
他们说他们需要时间来立案
They said they needed time to build this case,

1215
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:28,760
但我没有那么多时间
but it was something I didn't have,

1216
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,079
因为西蒙是个逃犯
because I knew that Simon was a fugitive.

1217
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:34,840
一有机会他就会溜掉  绝对的
The moment he was able to get away, he would.

1218
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:40,119
我不希望他逃脱审判
I didn't want him to get away with this.

1219
01:32:43,479 --> 01:32:47,000
我想跟新闻里的人取得联系
I wanted to talk to someone who was in the article.

1220
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,600
我在Instagram上找到了佩妮拉
I found Pernilla on Instagram.

1221
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:58,840
我从这个荷兰女孩艾琳那收到了私信
So I get a message from this Dutch girl, Ayleen,

1222
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,279
她说他是西蒙的女朋友
saying that she's the girlfriend of Simon,

1223
01:33:02,359 --> 01:33:04,239
她看见了这个故事
and she has seen the story

1224
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:05,600
感觉自己
and says that it feels like

1225
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,199
正在出演一部恐怖片
she is in the middle of a horror movie right now.

1226
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:11,199
<i>嗨</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

1227
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:13,960
艾琳说她会帮我们逮住他
Ayleen says she's going to help us catch him,

1228
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:17,520
但她要先做一些事情
but there's something she needs to do first.

1229
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:26,079
我要把我的钱搞回来  但要怎么做呢？  我需要制定计划
I needed to get my money back. But how?I had to come up with a plan.

1230
01:33:29,079 --> 01:33:33,920
突然间我意识到我处在绝对优势的地位
Suddenly I realized I was in a quite powerful position.

1231
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:42,800
他再也没办法从Tinder上钓女人了
He wasn't able to get any women on Tinder anymore

1232
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,920
因为全网都认识他的脸了
because his face was all over Google.

1233
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,239
他躲在布拉格
So he was hiding in Prague

1234
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:51,880
除了我这他无处可去
and he had absolutely nowhere else to go besides me.

1235
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:58,560
他总是告诉我要亲近你的朋友和敌人
He always told me keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

1236
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,399
为了使他相信我和他仍然是一条战线上的
To make him believe I was still on his side,

1237
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:09,720
我告诉他我仍然爱他  我相信他所说的一切
I told him I still love him,that I believed everything he said.

1238
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,560
我甚至把那些受害者称为贱人
I even called these girls bitches.

1239
01:34:15,159 --> 01:34:17,840
我一直在给西蒙发消息
I'm texting Simon all the time,

1240
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,439
比如  早上好 我爱你 你怎么样？
saying, "Good morning, love. How are you?"

1241
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,520
晚上好  睡个好觉  我爱你
"Good night. Sleep well.I love you. I miss you."

1242
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:28,560
他继续编造故事  毕竟他是大骗子嘛
And he keeps on telling me,and, of course, it's Simon,

1243
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,560
他需要钱来逃离敌人
that he needed money to escape from his enemies.

1244
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,720
他需要假护照
He needed fake passports.

1245
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,840
他想让我当掉我的车
He wanted me to pawn my car.

1246
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,159
他想让我把房子卖了
He wanted me to sell my house.

1247
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:50,680
就在那时我有了主意   我要去骗诈骗王
That's when I got my idea. I was going to swindle the Tinder Swindler.

1248
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,880
西蒙全身都只穿名牌时装  
Simon only wears designer clothes.He's covered in it.

1249
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,880
范思哲、古驰、路易斯威登、杜嘉班纳
Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton,Dolce & Gabbana.

1250
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:06,760
我在一家奢侈品牌时装厂工作
I work in the luxury fashion industry,

1251
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,840
所以我知道他的衣柜很值钱
so I know his wardrobe is worth a fortune.

1252
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,439
我告诉他  求你了  让我帮你把那些衣服卖了
I said to him,"Please, let me sell those clothes for you

1253
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,359
这样我们就能赚到钱了
so we can generate some money."

1254
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:22,640
西蒙带着他所有衣服
Simon has all of these clothes with him.

1255
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,239
我需要去布拉格
I needed to go to Prague.

1256
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,960
在我离开阿姆斯特丹之前  西蒙给了我一张信用卡
Before I leave Amsterdam,Simon had a credit card delivered to me.

1257
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,199
上面写着"大卫沙龙"
It says, "David Sharon."

1258
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:37,760
我拍了照片并发给警方
I take a picture and send it to the police,

1259
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:42,159
告诉他们西蒙正在捏造新身份
telling them Simon is creating a new identity.

1260
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,479
他的住址在无关紧要的地方
His address was in the middle of nowhere.

1261
01:35:57,119 --> 01:36:00,399
随着一步步靠近  我的心脏简直要跳出嗓子眼了
As I'm getting closer,my heart is pounding.

1262
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:06,720
我想  天哪  我怎么能想出这么蠢的计划？
I thought, "Oh, my God, how can I come up with such a stupid plan?

1263
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,119
因为我现在要跟他面对面
Because now I need to face him."

1264
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,880
他不是我的男朋友  也不是列维夫家族之子
He's not my boyfriend.He's not the son of Lev Leviev.

1265
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,920
他不为LLD钻石公司工作
He's not working for LLD Diamonds.

1266
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,479
他是个诈骗犯
He is a fraud,

1267
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:23,359
而且我不知道他到底有多大能耐
and I have absolutely no idea what he's capable of.

1268
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,279
他已经站在外面等我了
He was already standing outside waiting for me,

1269
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:32,520
他拥抱了我 亲吻了我的双唇
and he hugged me and he kissed me on the lips,

1270
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,840
我只感觉恶心
and I felt disgusting.

1271
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,399
我如此生气几乎要喊出来
I was so angry and I wanted to scream,

1272
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:43,479
但我只说了一句  我爱你 想你了
but the only thing I said was,"I love you and I missed you."

1273
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,760
他在布拉格市中心有个预约
He made an appointment in the center of Prague,

1274
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,079
他想让我和他一起去
and he wanted me to come along with him.

1275
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,159
我们在一位整形外科医生的总部办公室外停了下来
We stopped outside this head office of a plastic surgeon.

1276
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:01,359
我想 我的天这是要做什么？
I was like, "Oh, my God,what are we going to do here?"

1277
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:09,720
他想对颧骨、鼻子、嘴唇、也许还有下巴整形
He wanted to change his cheekbones,his nose, his lips, maybe his chin,

1278
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:12,479
整形外科医生说
and the plastic surgeon says,

1279
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,439
我很抱歉  但我不会做这个手术的
"I'm sorry,but I'm not going to do this surgery

1280
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,119
因为通常情况下只有逃犯会这样做
because only criminals want this."

1281
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,119
我差点没绷住
I almost spit out my water

1282
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,920
因为我真的很想告诉这位整形医生
because I really wanted to say to this surgeon,

1283
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,239
他确实是
"But he is a criminal."

1284
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:34,720
当我看着这个可悲的男人因为做不了整形手术而哭泣时
As I'm watching this pathetic man crying for not getting his plastic surgery,

1285
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,800
我想
I thought,

1286
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:42,279
如果你没做过那么多破事的话   我可能会稍稍同情一下你
"If you weren't such... a piece of shit,I would feel sorry for you."

1287
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:48,600
到了下午  我们仍然在玩着扮演男女朋友的游戏
In the afternoon,we played boyfriend and girlfriend,

1288
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:51,279
牵手、一起吃饭
holding hands, having dinner together.

1289
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:58,000
但我还需要睡在他旁边
But then I needed to still sleep next to him.

1290
01:38:02,119 --> 01:38:08,600
幸好他没打算对我做什么  但我依然僵硬地躺在床上
He didn't make any move, thank God,but I was just in bed, frozen,

1291
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:12,199
整夜注视着天花板
looking at the ceiling all night.

1292
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:23,439
清晨终于到来了  我收拾出了三个大箱子
Morning finally comes,I pack up three massive suitcases.

1293
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:30,960
西蒙甚至没有来帮我收拾
Simon didn't even help me with it.

1294
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,159
我离开前他给了我一封信
Right before I was leaving,he hands over this letter.

1295
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:44,600
他说  请在飞机上读   我没办法快速离开那里
He said, "Please read it in the plane."I cannot get out of there fast enough.

1296
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:54,000
我记得我保留了这封信
I remember that I had this letter.

1297
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,800
在这里
I have it here.

1298
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:02,039
亲爱的艾琳  你也知道这是我生命中最艰难的日子
"Dear Ayleen, well, as you know, this is the most difficult time of my life,

1299
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:06,000
我想感谢你一直陪在我身边
and I want to thank you that you are standing by my side

1300
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:08,159
坚定守候我们的爱情
and that you don't give up on our love."

1301
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:14,359
你是我的梦中情人  是我想要共建未来的人
"You are the woman of my dreams,and I want to build a future together."

1302
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,720
与你结婚是我的荣幸
"To marry you will be an honor for me."

1303
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:23,000
你是我想要建立家庭并生育孩子的女人
"And to make a family with kids together, you are the woman I see it with."

1304
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:27,760
你尽你所能地帮助了我
"You've got to help me with everything you can."

1305
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,720
为了你  为了你的父母  为了你的未来 这一切都是值得的
"It's for you, for your parents,for our future. I'm worth it."

1306
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:36,199
是时候让不可能变为可能了
"Now it's time to do the impossible possible."

1307
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:40,199
我祈祷能在余生里遇到像你一样的女人
"I'm blessed to have a woman like you in my life

1308
01:39:40,279 --> 01:39:43,239
并从此过上幸福的生活
to live in happy ever after."

1309
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:45,760
你是我的挚爱
"I love you like I never loved before."

1310
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,039
我信任你
"I trust you."

1311
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,520
不要放弃
"Don't give up."

1312
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,760
永远爱你的西蒙
"Love you forever, yours, Simon."

1313
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:57,279
一堆狗屎屁话
Just a piece of shit.

1314
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,039
我在不停地转卖
I'm on Operation Sell, Sell, Sell.

1315
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:22,520
西蒙一直在给我发短信
Simon is texting and calling me all the time.

1316
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:27,479
你卖了什么？我的钱呢？你得搞快点了
"What have you sold?Where's my money? You need to be quick."

1317
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:31,720
我一直跟他说我还什么都没卖出去
I keep on telling him I haven't sold anything.

1318
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:44,039
但实际上我一直都在出售  而且打算永远都不给他钱
I was selling, selling, selling. I was never going to send him the money.

1319
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:55,279
我刚收到通知说我收到了西蒙的一件物品的报价
I just got a notification that I got an offer for one of Simon's items.

1320
01:40:55,359 --> 01:40:56,920
这真是说曹操曹操到
Speaking of the Devil.

1321
01:40:58,279 --> 01:41:00,840
你仍然在卖这些东西吗？
So you're still selling his things now?

1322
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,800
是的
Yes, I'm still selling his things.

1323
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:11,239
当然这和我给他的一切承诺都不相符
Of course it wasn't in line with everything that I gave him,

1324
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:14,920
但我稍稍地感觉到钱回来了一点
but it felt like a little bit of payback.

1325
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:24,920
<i> 我们星期一需要钱</i>
<i>We need the money on Monday.</i>

1326
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,760
<i> 一天又一天  你是在争取时间吗？</i>
<i>Another day, another day.Are you trying to buy time?</i>

1327
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:32,439
<i> 你他爹的拖了三个星期   这根本不需要三个星期</i>
<i>You're dragging it over three fucking weeks. It doesn't take three weeks.</i>

1328
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:39,680
几周后他知道我把钱留下来了
After a few weeks, he knows that I was keeping the money for myself.

1329
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,439
这时他就原形毕露了
That's when he turned around completely.

1330
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:48,039
<i>你最好不要再玩我了！立刻停下来！</i>
<i>You stop playing game with me now! Stop!</i>

1331
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:53,239
他用如此具有攻击性的短信轰炸我
He bombs me with all these messages, and they were so aggressive.

1332
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:57,680
<i>如果你还活着就听好了！立刻把钱给我！</i>
<i>If you're active, listen to me!You're gonna give it today.</i>

1333
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,760
<i>你的末日要来了</i>
<i>You don't know where the fuck you're going.</i>

1334
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,399
差不多20分钟的录音
Voice memos of, like, 20 minutes.

1335
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:04,536
<i>我为我的失礼感到抱歉  但到此为止了</i>
<i>I'm sorry about what I said,but that's it.</i>

1336
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,439
<i>你确实在挑战我的底线</i>
<i>But you're taking the piss out of me.</i>

1337
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,319
这使我看到了他的多重人格
This is where I saw his several personalities.

1338
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:12,239
<i>我爱你也很在意你</i>
<i>I love you and I care about you.</i>

1339
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:13,760
<i>我他爹的问了你上千次了</i>
<i>I ask a thousand fucking times.</i>

1340
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,039
<i>我的语气那么和善  我是如此和善地跟你说话</i>
<i>I ask nicely. I'm speaking to you nicely.</i>

1341
01:42:16,119 --> 01:42:18,760
<i>我尝试给予你尊重  但看起来你根本不把我当回事</i>
<i>I try to respect you,but it's like you're fucking with me.</i>

1342
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
<i>你不知道我有多爱你</i>
<i>You have no idea how much I love you.</i>

1343
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,760
<i>你必须再信我最后一次</i>
<i>You just need to trust me one last time.</i>

1344
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:30,760
<i> 我明天需要答复  信我准没错的</i>
<i>I need an answer tomorrow. Believe in me.Have a leap of faith for one time. Do it.</i>

1345
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,159
<i>不要向我撒谎  我能看得出来</i>
<i>Don't send me lies.I know how to lie.</i>

1346
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:34,640
<i>我可以教你如何撒谎</i>
<i>I can teach you how to lie.</i>

1347
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,960
<i>我需要这些钱来助我一臂之力</i>
<i>I need this money to succeed.</i>

1348
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,880
<i> 帮帮我  我再没有其他人了  我只有你</i>
<i>Help me out here.I don't have nobody else. I have only you.</i>

1349
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,359
<i>真的求你了</i>
<i>I'm begging from you, please.</i>

1350
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,239
<i>我给了你建议  你自己选！</i>
<i>I give you advice. Choose it!</i>

1351
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:54,319
<i> 你消失了  没有人能看到你的消息</i>
<i>You disappear.Nobody can see your messages.</i>

1352
01:42:54,399 --> 01:42:56,439
<i>我不是站在你对立面的敌人</i>
<i>I'm not your enemy. I'm not fighting you.</i>

1353
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:01,479
<i>如果你跟你的狗屎家人胆敢玩弄我</i>
<i>And you will get the worst fucking enemy you have ever seen in your life</i>

1354
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,479
<i>你会遇到你这辈子见过的最可怕的人</i>
<i>for you and for your fucking family if you will ever play with me!</i>

1355
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,039
<i>今天之内给我</i>
<i>Give it today.</i>

1356
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:14,399
<i>艾琳  我对一切都感到抱歉</i>
<i>Look, Ayleen,I'm sorry about everything.</i>

1357
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:17,399
<i>这他爹的是最后的警告！限你今天之内给钱  你真的想要挑起战火？</i>
<i>I give you the last fucking warning! Today. You want war?</i>

1358
01:43:17,479 --> 01:43:20,760
<i>那你将如愿以偿！你他爹的等着战争找上门来吧！</i>
<i>You will get fucking war!You will get fucking war!</i>

1359
01:43:27,079 --> 01:43:29,079
这是非常可怕的经历
It was a horrible experience.

1360
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:36,520
但我的一部分其实很享受看到他惴惴不安
But part of me was actually enjoying seeing him "swerm."

1361
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,279
就像蛆一样不停蠕动
Squirm. No.

1362
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:45,600
<i>艾琳  能麻烦你帮我个忙吗？</i>
<i>Ayleen, can I ask you a favor?</i>

1363
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,479
<i>你能给我一张让我自己选择号码的彩票吗？</i>
<i>Can you put me one lottery ticket with numbers that I can choose?</i>

1364
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:54,000
你还能多可悲？ 我以为你是个亿万富翁
How pathetic can you be?I thought you were a billionaire.

1365
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:05,079
他没有钱进账  也没有人可以投靠
He has no money coming in.He had no one to go to.

1366
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,920
他甚至给我发了照片和短信
He even sent me pictures and texts

1367
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,600
说他在购物中心吃剩菜
that he was eating leftovers in a shopping mall.

1368
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:21,079
他长出了大胡子
He grew himself, like, this big beard.

1369
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:26,159
住在一晚12美元的旅馆
He was sleeping in hostels of $12 a night.

1370
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:37,760
这一刻我看到了真正的西蒙
At this moment, I see the real Simon,

1371
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:43,920
没了其他人的钱  他屁都不是
because without other people's money,he was nobody, and he's nothing.

1372
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:56,319
他甚至给自己取外号"流浪之王"
He even called himself"the homeless king."

1373
01:44:57,479 --> 01:45:00,960
从"钻石王子"堕落成了"流浪之王"
The prince of diamonds to this homeless king.

1374
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:04,119
铁窗泪
Cry me a river.

1375
01:45:11,479 --> 01:45:13,880
一个早晨他给我发了短信
One morning, I get a text from him.

1376
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:32,760
其实在几周前他提到他想去希腊
A few weeks before, he was just mentioning he wanted to go to Greece.

1377
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:38,720
我回消息时发现我的消息无法被接收
When I text him back, my message wasn't receiving.

1378
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,159
只有一个感叹号
I just saw one tick.

1379
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:45,720
那时我才意识到他在飞机上
That's when I realized that he was on a flight,

1380
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,239
因为一般来说西蒙永远是秒回状态
because Simon is always on his phone.

1381
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:56,920
我查询了从布拉格到雅典的航班
I'm searching for flights from Prague to Athens.

1382
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:05,479
查到了一趟跟他对得上时间的航班
I found a flight exactly the same time as he went offline.

1383
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:13,680
我把详情截图下来直接发给警方
I took a screenshot of the details, and I sent it directly to the police.

1384
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:20,840
他不会顶着西蒙列维夫的名头旅行  这个名字因为欺诈被通缉
He wouldn't travel under Simon Leviev because he was wanted for fraud.

1385
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:28,359
我还确认了上面有我之前在信用卡上看到的名字  大卫沙龙
I also make sure they had the name that I saw on the credit card, David Sharon.

1386
01:46:33,239 --> 01:46:35,680
现在他成了瓮中之鳖
Now, it was in the hands of the police.

1387
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:01,239
这是我这辈子最爽的时刻
It was one of the best moments of my life.

1388
01:47:02,439 --> 01:47:04,239
他甚至说...
He even says...

1389
01:47:09,479 --> 01:47:13,800
因为使用名为大卫沙龙的假护照
He got arrested by Interpol on a fake passport,

1390
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,600
他被国际刑警组织逮捕
under the name David Sharon.

1391
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,800
对
Yeah.

1392
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,199
艾琳告诉我  我们逮到他了！
Ayleen tells me, "We got him!"

1393
01:47:25,159 --> 01:47:27,359
我立刻给塞西莉打电话
I just wanted to call Cecilie.

1394
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:32,960
我说  你他爹的在跟我开玩笑吗？他真的被逮捕了？现在？就今天？
I was like, "Are you fucking kidding me?He's really caught? Now? Today?"

1395
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,960
这种喜悦甚至无法用语言表达出来
I can't even describe the joy it is.

1396
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:43,920
我就想要这个  想看到他戴上手铐
This is what I wanted.I wanted to see him in handcuffs.

1397
01:47:44,439 --> 01:47:46,720
我需要为自己伸张正义
I needed justice for myself.

1398
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,359
他知道你把那个信息交给警察了吗？
Does he know you gave that information to the police?

1399
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,119
不 他永远不会相信我能做出这些事情
No. He never believed that I was capable of doing this.

1400
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:57,199
他现在知道了
He knows now.

1401
01:47:59,319 --> 01:48:00,520
嗨 西蒙 
Hi, Simon.

1402
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,359
我们的努力没有白费
Everything that we did did have an effect.

1403
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:06,640
我们至少避免了一个新受害者的出现
We helped at least one person,

1404
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,720
而且确实逮捕了他
and we did get him arrested.

1405
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:12,920
也许没有完全符合我们的心意   但他确实被捕了
Maybe not for everything that we wanted, but he did get arrested.

1406
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,720
我们的行动卓有成效
So our action had a reaction.

1407
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:32,720
西蒙列维夫因在以色列犯下的罪行被判处15个月监禁

1408
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:37,920
并于5个月后被释放

1409
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:43,920
自从他获释后  西蒙推出了一个免费提供商业建议的网站

1410
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:59,920
西蒙的保镖彼得和商业伙伴阿维谢从未被指控与西蒙有关的任何非法活动

1411
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:07,920
西蒙孩子的母亲否认有任何不当行为

1412
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:12,920
波琳娜发现西蒙一直在骗她后就跟他分手了

1413
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,420
西蒙与以色列亿万富翁列夫列维夫或列维夫家族都没有任何关系

1414
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:22,220
没有证据表明LLD Diamonds或列维夫家族因走私钻石而受到任何正式指控

1415
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:27,920
西蒙目前正以自由之身的身份住在以色列

1416
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:34,119
刚买了新的iPhone 12 Pro  新鞋也到了  一切都是如此完美
Just got my new iPhone 12 Pro.Just received the new shoes. Perfect.

1417
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:42,119
他不再有经济问题

1418
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,479
这才是真正的交易  买辆宾利或者法拉利
This is the real deal.The Bentley or the Ferrari.

1419
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:55,679
塞西莉、佩妮拉和艾琳仍然需要偿还她们的债务

1420
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,379
西蒙从未被指控诈骗她们

1421
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:10,079
据估计他从全球各地的受害者那里诈骗了1000万美元

1422
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:16,079
自从西蒙被释放后他又回到了Tinder

1423
01:50:17,239 --> 01:50:20,359
祝你度过一个美好的夜晚
I wish you a great and magnificent evening.

1424
01:50:21,039 --> 01:50:25,359
他目前正在和一名以色列模特交往

1425
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:36,059
我们曾邀请西蒙参演这部影片

1426
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:39,770
他发来了这条信息

1420
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,399
<i> 我将会因为你们对我的诽谤和谎言</i>
<i>I will proceed with the lawsuit against you</i>

1421
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:44,239
<i>继续对你们提起诉讼</i>
<i>for defam-in-ation and lies</i>

1422
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:47,560
<i>你知道的  一切都建立在谎言之上</i>
<i>and, you know, that everything is based,basically, on a lie.</i>

1423
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:50,079
<i>这是你应得的  这就叫天道好轮回</i>
<i>And that's it, this is how it's gonna be.</i>

1424
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,359
塞西莉目前仍然单身

1424
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:57,119
从那以后你一直在使用Tinder吗？
Have you been on Tinder since?

1425
01:50:57,199 --> 01:51:00,000
是的  我知道你的意思
Yes. Oh, tons. Yeah, I know.

1426
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:02,680
每个人都在问我这件事  但Tinder是无辜的
Everyone is asking me.Tinder has nothing to do with this.

1427
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,399
我很快又开始玩Tinder
I was on Tinder immediately.

1428
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:07,800
-你仍在寻找真爱吗？   -是的
- You're still looking for love?- I'm still looking for love. So...

1429
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:10,039
我会一直寻找下去
Always.
