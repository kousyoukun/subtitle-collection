1
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,420
<i>Hey, pass the bottle over.</i>

2
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,060
<i>- A little busy back here. Okay?
- Yeah, we can see that, David.</i>

3
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,740
<i>Yeah, you can get un-busy.</i>

4
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,150
<i>Come on, Mama. I mean,
you know, we skipped graduation for this.</i>

5
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,460
<i>You are not graduating down there,
David Brody.</i>

6
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,260
<i>Hey, you better not be filming us.</i>

7
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,860
<i>No, just checking messages.</i>

8
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,150
<i>Your Trojan's in my head</i>

9
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,230
What was that?

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,350
- Do you see that?
- What?

11
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,230
Man. You guys seeing this?

12
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,220
- Whoa. Hey, Billy.
- Whoa. Ho-ho-ho.

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,920
Hang on.

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,150
- We should go.
- I gotta get this. Hang on.

15
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,580
- Can we go?
- Come on, let's go.

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,260
- Yeah. Hold on.
- Get in!

17
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,220
I will! Just give me one minute!

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,500
- Come on!
- Are you seeing this?

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,200
- Whoa!
- Billy, get in!

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,190
Shit! Tornado!

21
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,220
My God!

22
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,630
Get us out of here. Go!

23
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,500
<i>The tornado that struck Oklahoma last night...</i>

24
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,580
<i>...took the lives
of four high school students...</i>

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,630
<i>...when it picked up their car
and tossed it into the air.</i>

26
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,590
<i>Tornadoes in this region of the Midwest
are common, but it only took a glance...</i>

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>...to know this was different.</i>

28
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,820
<i>Not so much a twisting column
but a behemoth.</i>

29
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,350
Great. We missed another one.

30
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,860
Hey, you guys know
the goal of a documentary...

31
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,900
...is to actually document something, right?

32
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,470
<i>Copy that.</i>

33
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,820
We need a tornado.

34
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,320
That's it. We need a tornado. Yeah.
When was the last time we shot one, Lucas?

35
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,220
That EF4 that we shot a year ago.

36
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,500
Right. A year ago. So we're 0 for 365.

37
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,620
Let's figure that average.
Hey, Jacob, you play baseball. Right?

38
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,060
- Hockey, actually.
- Yeah? I played lacrosse.

39
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,950
- Really? No way.
- This is fun. It's like a family road trip.

40
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,460
- Did I miss something?
- Yeah, Jacob.

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,550
You missed everything.

42
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,900
No. Except we do have 200 hours
of cloud sunsets...

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,670
...and us going to every drive-through
from Idaho to Texas.

44
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,710
Which makes this the most expensive
home movie ever.

45
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,470
Just to be clear...

46
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,680
...we're gonna get paid
whether we see a tornado or not, right?

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,310
Right?

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,030
<i>Where do you wanna go, boss?</i>

49
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,500
I have no idea, Daryl.
My job is to shoot them...

50
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,870
<i>...not find them.</i>

51
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,140
- He's upset.
- What else is new?

52
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,020
Three months of that broken record.
I'm over it.

53
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,350
Just be thankful we're in here
and not in the Titus.

54
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,550
- Must be brutal in there.
<i>- You left the radio on, genius.</i>

55
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,590
Shit.

56
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,020
That probably didn't help his mood.

57
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,260
Screw his mood.
We've got other problems.

58
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,860
There's no way we could have known
that tornado was gonna hit.

59
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,540
<i>The National
Weather Service has issued a tornado watch...</i>

60
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,460
<i>...throughout Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri.</i>

61
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,780
Pete. National Weather posted
a tornado watch across five states.

62
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,460
Front's growing and moving fast.

63
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,700
I think this thing's gonna hit
about 200 miles north of here.

64
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,060
<i>Then we better haul ass.</i>

65
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,430
<i>If you're in the path of this storm,
you could be in for a very long day.</i>

66
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,060
Hey. So today is June 16th...

67
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,590
...and this is my time capsule message
to the future me.

68
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,180
Um... This is gonna be recorded
and stored for 25 years...

69
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,280
...when you, the 41-year-old
Donnie Fuller, will...

70
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,510
...I don't know,
see how life's panned out, I guess.

71
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,540
By now Dad is 65.

72
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,470
So Mom would have been...

73
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,340
Mom would have been 63.

74
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,040
Um...

75
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,420
What else?
You're a junior at Silverton High School.

76
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,600
You're head of the Video Club,
which is awesome.

77
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,630
And...

78
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,420
And that's pretty much it.

79
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,780
So this is Casa de Donnie...

80
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,260
Where you spend most your time...

81
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,100
...staring at the photo
of Kaitlyn Johnston and doing nothing.

82
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,100
- This is Trey, your annoying brother.
- Respect to you too.

83
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,900
By the time you see this,
Trey's gonna be in the state pen.

84
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,060
Heh. No way. I will be playing lead guitar
to 100,000 fans in Madison Square Garden.

85
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,430
But you will be stuck right here,
moaning over her.

86
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,420
This is Dad. He's the vice principal
at Silverton High School...

87
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,300
...which is not the greatest for me.

88
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,660
Dad?

89
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,840
Hey, come on. I'm having breakfast here.

90
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,740
- Trey, I am leaving in five, ready or not.
- Relax!

91
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,900
Wanna say something
to the future you, Dad?

92
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,340
Not now, Donnie, okay?
Busy day. Can't you see that?

93
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,700
Dad, you're the one...

94
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,540
...that wanted these video-time-capsule
pieces in the first place.

95
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,980
This weather's gonna kill the graduation
ceremony.

96
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,500
We should postpone it.

97
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,990
Okay. This is time-capsule interview,
version number two.

98
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,900
What kind of man am I?
That's a hard question to answer.

99
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,340
I mean, how do you describe perfection?

100
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,420
I thought you did your interview already.

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,660
I did. Yesterday.

102
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,710
But then I remembered I look way better
in the morning light.

103
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,660
Lift with your legs, Dad.

104
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,460
Come on, guys, I could use some help.

105
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,940
Man, I can't.
That old soccer-injury thing with my back.

106
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,860
- Yeah? You get all that?
- I did.

107
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,180
Good. Get in.

108
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,470
Shotgun!

109
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,900
- Donnie, let's go.
- I'm taking my bike.

110
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,020
Dude. Chill. If you want shotgun, just take it.

111
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,820
Hey, I'm sorry. With the storm
and graduation today, I got a lot on my plate.

112
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,900
- I know. It's always something. I'm used to it.
- What does that mean?

113
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,380
It means you're either ignoring me
or on my case.

114
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,700
- That's not true.
- If it's not my room, it's my grades.

115
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,070
Or it's this time capsule,
which I'm working my ass off to get done.

116
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,990
No. What's the point?
Nothing's ever good enough for you.

117
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,660
Stop for second. Let's talk.

118
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,630
No. Busy day, Dad. Can't you see that?

119
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,060
All right, Dad. Dad.

120
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,300
Right at this moment... Don't even think
about it before you answer. Just blurt it out.

121
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,750
...who is your favorite son?

122
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,230
Get in the car.

123
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,110
Well.

124
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,220
I know we missed it last night.
We couldn't get there in time.

125
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,240
Yeah. I know. I know.

126
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,350
Well, if you pull my funding, that's it for me.

127
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,590
And we're onto a big one.

128
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,740
I don't know how big. It's a tornado.

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,380
They don't call to tell me
how big they're gonna be.

130
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,030
There's a massive storm front moving
through the area.

131
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,960
We're gonna get it.
We just don't have it yet.

132
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,270
Well, she was your idea.

133
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,740
I wanted David Sinclair, remember?

134
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,150
Yeah. Well, I was getting a lot closer
without Allison and her data.

135
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,180
It's an instinct game.

136
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,190
And she ain't got it.

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,940
Hey, Jacob. A little help?

138
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,140
- I can't. If I stop filming, Pete's gonna fire me.
- Dude.

139
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,980
Don't you dare let him bully you.

140
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,100
Easy for you to say.
You're not the one sitting next to him.

141
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,430
You having fun yet?

142
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,180
Yeah, dude.
This is so much better than Cancan.

143
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,460
I'm telling you,
last year we got within 100 yards.

144
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,750
It's like nothing you've seen before.
Trust me.

145
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,070
Okay, so larger system is moving
toward Riverside as predicted.

146
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,470
I think we should go here.

147
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,620
The wind and precipitation readings
in the trailing cell look better for a funnel.

148
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,180
Exactly what you said
about Morristown and Osgood.

149
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,860
This one's different. It's not following
the pattern. It's growing faster.

150
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,060
It's growing faster.

151
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,420
Every storm chaser
this side of Hawaii is going to Riverside.

152
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,340
Which, by the way,
is where I think we should go.

153
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,510
But you want us to go where? Silverton?

154
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,430
If you would like, consider this
an instinct thing instead of a data thing.

155
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,310
If you heard that,
then you also heard that Steve cut us off.

156
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,540
- And it's on my dime now.
- I heard that.

157
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,820
This is months on the road.
And guess what.

158
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,190
We got nothing you can't get on YouTube.
Worst season I've ever had.

159
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,740
You think this is instinct. I think it's data.

160
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,860
The fact is,
it's neither without a big fat dose of luck.

161
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,310
And there is nothing I can do about that.
Okay?

162
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,020
So back off of me.

163
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,900
I just want you and your data
to find me a goddamn tornado.

164
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,470
Then Silverton's our best chance.

165
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,550
What do you think?

166
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,830
She's the one with all the degrees.

167
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,430
My money's on her.

168
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,800
Silverton it is.

169
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,060
You better be right about this.

170
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,630
- It's your last chance.
- Wow.

171
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,260
Yeah, okay. Hang on. Okay. It's okay.

172
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,860
All right. We recording?

173
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,150
- We're good?
- You ready?

174
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,340
- Hell, yeah, man!
- Yeah! Get fired up!

175
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,980
- I'm ready!
- You ready for this shit?

176
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,540
Maybe we should get some girls
to watch this stunt?

177
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,420
That's what I'm talking about.
Get fired up! Let's go for real! It's go time!

178
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,540
- Let's go, let's go!
- Safety first.

179
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,540
Okay, just do a test run first, all right?
Move, jackass!

180
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,070
- Get out of the way. Here we go.
- Come on. Yeah. You got it, buddy.

181
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,140
- Come on, buddy!
- Come on, Donk! Let's go, boy!

182
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,270
He's gonna check the speed on this one.

183
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,380
Yeah! Do it, Bro!

184
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,300
- Let's go!
- Test drive!

185
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,080
Let's go for the test drive!

186
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,660
There you go, Donkie!

187
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,470
Well, that looked pretty good to me.
What do you think?

188
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,020
What? You wanna
nail some tail or what, dog?

189
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,220
- I'm always up for nailing tail!
- That's what I'm talking about.

190
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,140
Once this hits the Internet, you'll
be beating them off with a stick.

191
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,420
- Fours? Fives? All kinds?
- I'm talking fives, sixes.

192
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,980
Fives, for sure. Come on!

193
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,390
- Bam!
- Trust me, buddy!

194
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,470
Yeah! All right! Hang on.

195
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,350
- Richie! Record this, son.
- Are you drunk?

196
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,340
- Yeah.
- I'm just getting started.

197
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,780
Hang on! Wait!
We're gonna light the pool on fire.

198
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,980
- Light that thing, Richie!
- Yeah! Light it up!

199
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,420
Light that puppy up.

200
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,620
- Whoa!
- My God!

201
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,910
The Flaming Pool of Death!

202
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,430
You ready to go?

203
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,900
Let's do this!

204
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,140
Action!

205
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,350
That's right! Come on, Donk!
You got this!

206
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,790
Oopsie daisy!

207
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,180
That was awesome.

208
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,940
That was awesome, Donk.

209
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,910
- A million hits, easy!
- A million?

210
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,630
- Maybe more!
- Hell, yeah, dude! We're gonna be famous!

211
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,430
- Shit, my pool!
- Dude, your mom. Your mom.

212
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,100
What the hell are you two idiots doing?

213
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,940
- I thought you were at work!
- That makes any difference?

214
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,190
Look!

215
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,390
- That's the <i>Titus!</i> I've seen it on TV! Come on!
- Bye, Ma!

216
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,260
Let's take a tour of the ultimate
storm-chasing vehicle, the Titus.

217
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,900
She's equipped with 24 surveillance cameras,
so we have eyes from every angle.

218
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,190
Bulletproof Lexan windows.

219
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,980
A gyroscopic stabilized camera.

220
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,390
A five-ton winch.

221
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,100
Four-millimeter solid steel armor.

222
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,820
Now, back here, we have
a mini weather center, complete with...

223
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,790
...an anemometer, humidity sensor
and potentiometer.

224
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,110
But the thing that makes her really special
are these grappling claws.

225
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,260
They can stabilize us in winds
up to 170 miles an hour.

226
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,670
We're not going anywhere
with those suckers dug in.

227
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,560
Clear!

228
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,320
This is the culmination of my life's work.

229
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,820
What about the turret, Pete?

230
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,790
Right. The turret is up here.

231
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,470
Which gives us a 360-degree view
of outside.

232
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,660
It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that
will, when we find one of these bad boys...

233
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,790
...give us the shot of the century.

234
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,640
A sight nobody but God has witnessed:

235
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,840
the eye of the tornado.

236
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,790
That means "cut," Jacob. Cut it.

237
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,260
Let's get some B roll.

238
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,940
Get shots of the claws, the instruments
on the back, panel stuff.

239
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,270
- Just give me stuff I can use. Okay?
- Got it.

240
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,270
My storm's expanding.

241
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,710
That means it's going to be really big
by the time it gets here.

242
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,590
Hey.

243
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,630
How's my bug?

244
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,430
Well, listen, um...

245
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,580
I know I was gonna try
and make it home this weekend...

246
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,190
...but we got a real big storm coming,
and Mama's gotta work.

247
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,190
No. No. I'm gonna need you to tell Grandma
and Grandpa that we're...

248
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,340
I know.

249
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,030
I know, sweet girl. I'm sorry.

250
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm really sorry.

251
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,950
Gracie...

252
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,830
Grace...

253
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,870
Hey, hey.

254
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,790
Did you get all that?

255
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,220
We can't postpone this, Gary.
There's not enough room inside for everyone.

256
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,700
- The weather's gonna be fine.
- It's your call.

257
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,780
There's Dad taking shit
from Principal Walker.

258
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,230
I will do that.

259
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,630
Did you get the last of the interviews?

260
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,820
I still got a few to do.

261
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,340
But what I did get was a nice shot
of Miss Bell's cleavage. Wanna see?

262
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,590
Trey.

263
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,660
What? You don't get many teachers
with a rack like that.

264
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,620
Cut it out. We need to start editing
right after graduation.

265
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,100
Dad wants the clips online
by the end of next week.

266
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,580
What's the point of doing
a video time capsule?

267
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,150
Video won't even exist in 25 years.

268
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,980
What? Let's just get it finished. Okay?

269
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,270
Fine.

270
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,860
Did you see the weather report?
Supposed to be a big storm coming.

271
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,540
Maybe they'll cancel the whole...

272
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,300
Whoa. There's your girl.

273
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,700
If I don't get it by the end of the day,
you'll not get the internship.

274
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,100
It's as simple as that.

275
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,300
Dude. Now's your chance, man.
Vulnerable girl.

276
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,460
Comforting guy. Right?
Just go talk to her and see if she's okay.

277
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,940
- We have work to do.
- Chickenshit. Come on.

278
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,780
I need to get the last of the interviews,
and Dad's, like, on my case about it.

279
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,940
Screw Dad.
Go do something for yourself for once.

280
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,150
Bro, I am literally begging you.
Just go talk to her.

281
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,670
All right?

282
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,980
All right.

283
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,460
Yeah?

284
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,220
- Stop.
- Heh.

285
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,110
Have fun.

286
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,630
He's really doing it.
I gotta film this train wreck.

287
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,580
And he's pulling into the station.

288
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,440
Hey, Kaitlyn?

289
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,460
Hey.

290
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,980
It's Donnie.

291
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,630
Yeah. I know.

292
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,590
Strike one.

293
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,260
Are you okay?
I saw you outside with Miss Blasky.

294
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,510
Right.

295
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,500
I had this application for an apprenticeship,
and it had to be submitted by the weekend.

296
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,100
And Miss Blasky checked it for me,
and it's just completely corrupted.

297
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,550
I don't know what happened to it.

298
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,070
It was fine yesterday.

299
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,660
Yeah. Yeah, that's toast. What was it about?

300
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,460
The abandoned factory on Garner.

301
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,300
- The paper mill?
- Yeah.

302
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,620
Yeah.

303
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,060
When they shut it down,
the state never paid for an official cleanup.

304
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,630
So there's all these chemicals
and hazardous materials sitting there...

305
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,110
...contaminating the soil
and probably running off into the water.

306
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,340
- That's what the film's about.
- Pretend to be interested.

307
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,140
Anyway, the submission doesn't make
any sense at all without it.

308
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,670
- So I'm screwed.
- Come on, man. Take a swing.

309
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,590
- You're into all this environmental stuff?
- Come on, man. Just ask her out.

310
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,860
Gotta take care of the planet, right?

311
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,780
Or else the planet
will take care of us, right? Heh.

312
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,260
That was awkward.

313
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,070
Heh. Yeah. Well, some of us care,
or at least are trying to.

314
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,340
No. I'm sorry.

315
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,060
I can help. I have all these cameras
and this editing software and...

316
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,670
Well, this will be easy.
We can reshoot this.

318
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,830
- It'd have to be today.
- Today?

319
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,060
You're filming the graduation.
No, it's fine.

320
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,190
No. No. My brother, Trey,
he's good with all this stuff too.

321
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,780
- He can get that.
- No way.

322
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,900
- Like, he can get that footage.
- Really?

323
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,390
- It's not a problem.
- Sure?

324
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,950
- Yes, it's a problem.
- I'm sure. Yeah.

325
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,900
Thank you so much.

326
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,860
No. You have no idea what this means
for me. I owe you so big for this.

327
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,670
No. Well, you know,
me and the planet go way back, so...

328
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,910
Thank you.

329
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,220
- I'll see you later.
- Cool.

330
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,740
- Thank you.
- Okay, no.

331
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,910
This is so not cool.

332
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,990
You are kidding me.

333
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,120
What are you doing?

334
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,340
What are you doing?

335
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,060
You're gonna skip the ceremony?

336
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,820
Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,550
You said do something for yourself,
so I'm doing something for myself.

338
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,230
Yeah. And leaving me to do all the filming?

339
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,790
You can handle it. Right?

340
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,870
You can handle it, right?

341
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,660
- Yes.
- Heh.

342
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,900
Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Hey. You go for it, Bro.

343
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,740
But get some skin on camera.
E-mail it to me.

344
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,060
- Just get the interviews, all right?
- All right, all right, I'm going.

345
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,310
Okay.

346
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,070
Yo, Todd. We're rolling.

347
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,940
Yo, what's up, me?
How's life in the future, Bro?

348
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,940
So I just know by now you are playing
for the NBA, you're super loaded...

349
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,860
...and you got a super-smoking-hot
cheerleader wife.

350
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,270
So why the hell are you watching this
right now?

351
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,310
Why don't you get up to your penthouse
and bang her good, right?

352
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,180
That's your time-capsule message, Todd?

353
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,420
Why not?

354
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,260
A message?

355
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,150
Too late for me. Too late for these guys.
But my kids? Grandkids? Simple.

356
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,780
Study. Get good grades.

357
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,860
Or else you're gonna hang around this
group of losers shoveling shit all day. Sorry.

358
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,140
Please marry a rich guy.
Please marry a rich guy.

359
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,350
We're rolling.

360
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,070
So, what would you like to say
to yourself in 25 years?

361
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,980
That was it.

362
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,620
Twenty-five years' time? My guess is
we'd have blown up the world by that time.

363
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,820
All right.

364
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,100
High school sucked.

365
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,470
Hopefully, it was all worth it.
You've got your Ph.D. from Brown.

366
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,300
You're doing research
and using your skills to help...

367
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,000
Douche-rocket!

368
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,430
Sorry, man.

369
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,780
- Radio check.
- Yes, sir.

370
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,620
<i>Copy that.</i>

371
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,160
Camera's good.

372
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,540
Hey, guys. So you think we'll get to see
a tornado today or what?

373
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,030
You never know.

374
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,830
Jacob, did you bring
all the camera batteries? I only saw four.

375
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,870
I, left them back at the hotel on charge.

376
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,060
Today is not a good day to run out of power.
We gotta go get them.

377
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,740
Let's get moving. This system's
supposed to hit within the hour.

378
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,180
If that.

379
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,710
Come on, dude, get your shit together, man.
You're making me look bad.

380
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,820
Mike check. One, two, three.

381
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,340
- Where's Donnie?
- Mike check.

382
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,280
- Yeah, it's good.
- I don't know. Around.

383
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,220
- He knows what time we're starting?
- Yeah, sure.

384
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,230
Anyway, I can run the cameras.

385
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,790
All three?

386
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,030
Well, yes, Dad.
That's why they invented tripods.

387
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,430
Trey, this is important.

388
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,420
And I can't do it, right?

389
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,750
I didn't say that.

390
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,030
You kind of did.

391
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,700
Hey, Mom. How's Gracie? She still mad?

392
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,060
<i>She's 5 years old. She'll be fine.</i>

393
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,950
I know, but I've been gone for months.
That's too long to be away from her.

394
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,980
I keep thinking it was a mistake coming here.

395
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,710
<i>Allison, we're fine.</i>

396
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,460
<i>This is your job.
What you're doing is important.</i>

397
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,660
I can't stop thinking
about those kids that died.

398
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,110
<i>What kids?</i>

399
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,260
Nothing, sweetie. Grandma
and Mama were just talking. But listen.

400
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,990
I am sorry about our call earlier, okay?
I don't want you mad at me.

401
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,780
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

402
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,100
Real soon. The season's almost over.

403
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,980
<i>Why can't you just come now?</i>

404
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,870
I wish I could. I really do. I miss you.

405
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,350
Allison!

406
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,300
Listen, I gotta go. But I'm gonna check in
every couple hours, okay?

407
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,390
<i>Promise me you'll be home soon?</i>

408
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,630
I promise.

409
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,320
Allison!

410
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,020
I gotta go. I love you, bug.

411
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,780
<i>I love you too.</i>

412
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,980
I'm coming, boss!

413
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,780
<i>We have now confirmed
that a tornado has hit Riverside.</i>

414
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,460
<i>All of Shaw County remains
under a severe thunderstorm warning.</i>

415
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,190
<i>Chuck, what do you see on radar?</i>

416
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,700
<i>What we're watching now is this very rapid...</i>

417
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,300
- Data?
- Shit.

418
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,830
Maybe we'll catch the tail end of it.

419
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,110
- What's going on in Silverton?
- Give me a minute.

420
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,980
Um, it's dissipating. There's some scattered
thunderstorms and that's about it.

421
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,870
Thunderstorms? Thunderstorms.

422
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,860
Put everything in the van.
We're moving now.

423
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,340
Where do you wanna go?

424
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,300
You're not going anywhere.
We are going to Riverside.

425
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,300
- How about...?
- We'll catch the next one.

426
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:38,070
Look. There's not gonna be a next one.

427
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,720
Let's go.

428
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,950
Look at the size of them!

429
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,380
- I thought you said it was dissipating.
- It was.

430
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,660
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna check the <i>Doppler!</i>

431
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,440
Right behind you, Allison.

432
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,900
Whoa, wait! Wait up!

433
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,020
You see these, Allison? These are huge!

434
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,390
Yeah!

435
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,910
Son of a bitch!

436
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,990
My God! Look at these, guys!
They're bigger than golf balls!

437
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,230
Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

438
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,380
- What do we got?
- It's regenerating.

439
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,630
And?

440
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,220
Silverton.

441
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,510
It's coming.

442
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,830
Great.

443
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,060
Great.

444
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,540
To all the students
of this year's graduating class...

445
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:48,670
...who have dedicated themselves to
the hard work necessary to reach this day...

446
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,110
...you are now standing on the threshold
of adult life.

447
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,270
You are free to take your own path...

448
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,580
...and that path will be different for all of you.

449
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,900
But it's now time to create your own lives.

450
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,790
To create your own destiny.

451
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,900
I mean, look at this place.

452
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,580
They should tear it down. Decontaminate it.

453
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,900
Plant some trees or a garden or something.

454
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,950
They should totally build a skate park here.

455
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,100
No, a garden. Definitely a garden.

456
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,340
Yeah.

457
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,990
So you wanna just
put the tripod down over there?

458
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,820
Wow.

459
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,550
- Watch your step.
- Yeah.

460
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,820
I look okay?

461
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,070
Yeah. You look beautiful.

462
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,910
I wasn't saying... I was, like, for the...

463
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,460
I don't know. I'm rolling here.

464
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,590
- So whenever you're ready to...
- Thanks, Donnie. You're really sweet.

465
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,510
Right.

466
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,420
<i>Pete, where are you?</i>

467
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,310
I'm coming right up.

468
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,900
- Got wall cloud to the east.
- Whoa.

469
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,460
Yeah, but no vortex.

470
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,140
- Jacob. I got some circulation over here.
- Over here, got it.

471
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,940
It's heading towards those trees.

472
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,620
<i>I'm on Oakwood Road.</i>

473
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,660
<i>If you're in Shaw County, you need
to get yourself to a safe place now.</i>

474
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,540
<i>This thing is going to track right,
almost towards town.</i>

475
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,820
<i>There it is now.
You can see the wall cloud.</i>

476
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,110
<i>It's lower as it transitions to the east.</i>

477
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,260
- Just south. Right behind the base.
- Wow. Look at that.

478
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,860
Come on, baby.

479
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,230
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

480
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,990
What are those idiots doing?

481
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,620
- Aw, this is a beauty!
- Whoo!

482
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,060
Yeah! Twista Hunterz, baby!

483
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,990
Get in the field! Get in the field!

484
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,980
Look at that funnel.

485
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,080
We got a vortex. Come on.
Here we go, guys. Here we go.

486
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,340
There's debris.

487
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,180
- Jake, you getting this?
- Yeah.

488
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,430
<i>There it is.</i>

489
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,420
<i>This tornado just touched down.
We can see it from here.</i>

490
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,390
<i>It's ripping up trees.
It's ripping up everything in sight.</i>

491
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,510
<i>If you're above ground, you need to get
to a storm shelter or a safe place right now.</i>

492
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,150
I leave you with John Updike's words:

493
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,070
"You cannot help but learn more
as you take the world into your hands."

494
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,390
"Take it up reverently..."

495
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,120
"...for it is an old piece of clay,
with millions of thumbprints on it."

496
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,380
Great.

497
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,220
I guess we should...

498
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,670
I guess we should start finishing up, then.

499
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,060
Whoo! Look at the size of that sucker!

500
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,680
Look how fast it's spinning, man!

501
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,220
Shit! Man, that was close!

502
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,060
Dude. My arm hairs.

503
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,140
No. Dude, it's your "hairs" hairs!

504
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,390
They're standing up on your head, Bro!

505
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,740
Come on. Come on.

506
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,100
- That's the vorticity stretching.
- We're on, we're on. Let's move!

507
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,340
- I wanna report a tornado on the ground.
- Let's go.

508
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,940
There's no damage yet,
but it's in a semi-residential area.

509
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,100
About 15 miles to the north of Silverton,
Oklahoma.

510
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,910
Seniors! Stand up!

511
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,280
Stand up!

512
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,630
We salute you!

513
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,280
All right!

514
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,620
Go inside, guys.

515
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,380
- Stay calm! Move inside in an orderly fashion!
- Everybody, back inside.

516
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,420
- To the main building.
- Dude, come on.

517
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,390
Quickly as you can.

518
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,470
Shit!

519
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,230
Here we go! Quickly! Come on!

520
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,350
Here we go! Come on, this way.

521
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,980
<i>Pete, give me an update.</i>

522
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,460
I'm gonna find the intercept
near Grant and Malcolm.

523
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,700
- Approach it from the east.
<i>- Jake, you're out of focus. Tighten up.</i>

524
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,500
<i>You need to position yourself.
This thing is moving fast.</i>

525
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,180
I need a clear path.

526
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,300
I got a field coming up on your right
that should have access.

527
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,460
<i>Give me a second to calculate rotation speed.</i>

528
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,430
Make it fast.

529
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,260
<i>- Wind speed is 140.</i>
- Direction?

530
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,510
Southeast.

531
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,140
- Lucas, we good?
- Yeah. We good. We good.

532
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,820
You getting this, Jacob?

533
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,230
Yeah. Sure.

534
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,300
Okay. Ready for intercept.

535
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,710
Daryl, pull over.

536
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,820
- Get out there, dog! Get out there!
- Look at me!

537
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,470
- I'm in a tornado! I'm in a tornado!
- Whoo!

538
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,390
- Yeah!
- My God!

539
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,310
We're in the path! We're in the path!

540
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,550
Okay. Anchor down. How we looking?

541
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,830
- It's heading right for you.
- Get ready, guys.

542
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,070
Shit.

543
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,820
Shit! My God!

544
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,470
Jacob! Don't you lose it on me, you hear?

545
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,870
Hold on, boys!

546
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,390
Shit! You guys, come on, now!

547
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,590
This is crazy, you guys. This is nuts.

548
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,030
Come on, come on! God!

549
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,190
Shit, that thing is crazy!

550
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,790
Hang on!

551
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,310
It's coming right! Go! Go on!

552
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,900
Damn it!

553
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,830
<i>It dodged to our left.</i>

554
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,030
Shit.

555
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,670
It's headed for the school.

556
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,190
Everybody! Okay, go!

557
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,390
Here we go. Here we go. Keep moving.
All the way down the hall.

558
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,710
Keep this door open. Come on.

559
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,940
- Move on in, folks. Move in.
- Come on.

560
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,310
Jesus.

561
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,550
Everybody into the storm shelter area.

562
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,630
- Keep this hallway clear.
- Come on.

563
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,260
- Make sure nobody's behind us.
- All the way down!

564
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,700
Go on, all the way in.

565
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,620
Trey! Where's Donnie?

566
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,830
I don't exactly know.

567
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,670
Get away from the window.

568
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,660
Tornado!

569
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,440
Get going! Run!

570
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,030
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go!

571
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,660
It's okay!

572
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,300
All the way down the hall! Keep going!

573
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,430
All the way down! Keep moving.
Come on. Fast as you can!

574
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,510
Okay, get down!

575
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,140
Let's go. Come on.

576
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,510
Face the wall! Cover your heads!
Stay down!

577
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,950
Heads down, everybody!
Everyone stay down!

578
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,470
Get your heads down!

579
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,710
Get your head down.

580
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,230
Stay against the wall!

581
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,910
No, no! My God!

582
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,750
Trey!

583
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,270
Dad!

584
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,380
Anybody hurt?

585
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,270
We're all right.

586
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,440
- Trey?
- Yeah. I'm good.

587
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,750
You ready?

588
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,920
Hey, can you hold this? You got it?

589
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,900
- My dad.
- Are you gonna answer it?

590
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,740
No. You kidding me?
I missed the whole grad ceremony. No.

591
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,580
Is he gonna be pissed at you?

592
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,780
Nah. You know what?
Trey will have filmed it.

593
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,870
Come on, pick up.

594
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,270
- Trey, give me your phone.
- Yeah.

595
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,070
- Trey?
- Donnie, you okay?

596
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,580
Dad? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

597
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,780
<i>Where are you?</i>

598
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:44,630
Dad, Trey can handle all the filming and stuff.
It's not, like, a problem.

599
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,980
Never mind about that. Are you safe?
Tell me where you are.

600
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,630
<i>Safe? Yeah. I'm at the old paper mill.</i>

601
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,300
- On Garner?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

602
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,260
Listen, it's really important that you...

603
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,820
<i>- Dad? Dad?</i>
- Donnie?

604
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,620
- Dad?
<i>- Stay where you are...</i>

605
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,870
Donnie?

606
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,420
- Donnie!
- What happened?

607
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,550
It just cut out. Here.

608
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,110
Whoa.

609
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,430
- Maybe we should go.
- Heh. Yeah.

610
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,430
- What is that?
- I don't know.

611
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,030
Come on!

612
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,340
It's all right. It's all right.

613
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,390
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get my son. He's out there.

614
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,950
My God.

615
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,500
<i>From our vantage point...</i>

616
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,620
<i>...the damage could have been
a whole lot worse.</i>

617
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,790
<i>The tornado just narrowly grazed
the school...</i>

618
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,300
Daryl, are you hearing this?

619
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,180
<i>...as you can see from this footage.</i>

620
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,070
<i>The National Weather Service is currently
tracking a second supercell...</i>

621
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,940
<i>...moving in our direction.
I know it's hard to imagine...</i>

622
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,100
A second cell.

623
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,070
- This is gonna be bad.
- How can there be another system?

624
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,870
I've never seen anything like this.
These updrafts are insane.

625
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,070
Got downed power lines.

626
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,740
- We're stuck.
- It's all right. I'm about to make his day.

627
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,020
<i>We're gonna send it
back to Don Lemon in the studio.</i>

628
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,070
Heads up, Lucas. Live wire.

629
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,660
What else we got?

630
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,060
Activity heading toward the center of town.

631
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,260
Second cell?

632
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,580
It's organized. The hook echo is huge.

633
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,620
I wanna set up
as close to the perimeter as possible.

634
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,020
I wanna be in the middle.

635
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,780
- I'm not gonna miss it.
- I hear you.

636
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,340
- Jake, how you doing?
<i>- Never better.</i>

637
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,900
You hang in there, honey.
That was nothing. Here you go.

638
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,380
Send that to my GPS. Let's roll. Come on.

639
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,390
You want a coffee with that, boss?

640
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,110
Kaitlyn?

641
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,270
Kaitlyn!

642
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,540
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah. My leg.

643
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,110
Okay. Your leg?

644
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,260
Here, let me see it.

645
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,220
It really hurts.

646
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,790
Hold on.

647
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,750
Okay. All right, hang on.

648
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,230
Don't touch it.

649
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,990
I'm gonna tie this, okay?

650
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,990
- Be careful.
- Sorry.

651
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,670
- All right?
- Yeah.

652
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,100
What was Donnie doing there
in the first place?

653
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,150
He's with Kaitlyn.
He's been in love with her forever.

654
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,380
Johnston?

655
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,180
Yeah. He's shooting this video project
thing for her.

656
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,780
Why didn't he just tell me?

657
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,100
I don't know, Dad. You're so easy to talk to.

658
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,670
I'm just saying.

659
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,270
Whoa.

660
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,590
My God.

661
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,590
Hey, boy.

662
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,940
Hey.

663
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,990
Dad, that's Chester's dog.

664
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,390
Chester?

665
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,630
Chester?

666
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,350
Chester!

667
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,270
Dad, be careful!

668
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,780
- You okay?
- Had to go looking for shelter.

669
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,030
Was gonna drive.

670
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,260
Let me see.

671
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,880
- You hurt?
- Get the door.

672
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,460
The belt's stuck.

673
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,710
I gotta cut him out.

674
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,790
Hey, can I get some help over here?

675
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,400
Here.

676
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,960
- I know, I'm not supposed to have that.
- We'll talk about that later. Hang on.

677
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,540
- Put this under him.
- Yep.

678
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,550
- Right there.
- Put him down.

679
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,340
Can you get everybody to the high school?

680
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,390
They've got a storm shelter.

681
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,860
- You wanna go with them?
- No way.

682
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,070
- Make sure he's okay.
- You got it.

683
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,070
Shit.

684
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,710
Come on.

685
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,270
Try your phone again.

686
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,110
Come on, come on, come on.

687
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,260
- Anything?
- There's no signal.

688
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,960
Damn it.

689
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,760
There are those idiots.

690
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,380
Pull over.

691
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,900
Hey, Pete, you can pass us.

692
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,380
<i>- Allison, we don't have time to waste.</i>
- Yeah, we'll catch up to you.

693
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,950
Hello! Your main man Reevis here.

694
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,950
- I'm with my buddy Donk.
- Badonkadonk! Heh.

695
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,580
- What just happened?
- All right, so check this out.

696
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,940
I was in a tornado, right?
And let me tell you. One word:

697
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,860
- "It sucked."
- That's two words, jackass.

698
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:25,260
I know. Two words, but I was, like,
getting sucked up in the thing.

699
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,260
It was smart back there with the knife.

700
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,310
Thanks. I thought you'd be mad.

701
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,030
I am. Hand it over.

702
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,750
We should turn left on Main.

703
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm gonna take the highway.

704
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,700
Dad, if we cut through Main,
we can take Rosewood all the way.

705
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,950
We save like 20 minutes.

706
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,830
All right.

707
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,460
Hey, guys!

708
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,240
Gentlemen!

709
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,030
It's gonna be damn head.

710
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,220
Hey.

711
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,180
- You two need to go inside and stay there.
- Whoa.

712
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,700
You guys actually get paid to do this shit?

713
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,540
I'm in the wrong damn job, man.

714
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,260
- You don't have a job.
- Heh.

715
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,750
Let's go, Allison!

716
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,420
Grab a brew.
It's like a zombie apocalypse out here.

717
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,900
- We're wasting time.
- I don't think we can leave them.

718
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,660
- Look. They're not our responsibility.
- They're drunk.

719
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,820
- Guys.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You getting this?

720
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:20,670
- Look, look. Donk, Donk.
- Hell, yeah!

721
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,660
Hell, yeah.

722
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,440
Look at it.

723
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,030
- Whoa, shit! Where did it go?
- Where'd it go? What?

724
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,380
Where is it...?

725
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,350
- It's moving, it's moving, it's moving.
- Whoa.

726
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,830
Hey, Allison, what's happening?

727
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,000
Keep filming.

728
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,700
- Whoa!
- Guys! Look at that!

729
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,220
Reevis! My God! My God!

730
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,950
- Yeah!
- You getting it?

731
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,300
No! No! Holy shit!

732
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,110
- My truck!
- My God!

733
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,750
Dad!

734
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,240
Get out and run for the bank!

735
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,300
Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry!

736
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,590
Shit!

737
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,710
- My God!
- Dad! Hurry!

738
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,950
Go inside!

739
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,910
Trey!

740
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,870
God!

741
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,860
Hang on!

742
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,540
- My God! No, no, no!
- Hang on!

743
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,270
Dad, hold on!

744
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,590
- God!
- I've got you!

745
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,740
Hold on!

746
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,630
I won't let you go!

747
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,350
Grab the door!

748
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,260
No. Dad, no!

749
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,990
My God! My God!

750
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,700
Are you okay?

751
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,240
Yeah.

752
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,900
- Allison, you okay?
- Come on, Trey. Let's get in the car.

753
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,460
- Everyone here?
- Yeah.

754
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,320
This is crazy, guys.

755
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,070
Shit.

756
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,840
Whoa.

757
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,380
Hey, can I use your cell?
My son's out there. I got no signal.

758
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,420
I don't either.

760
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,620
Where is he?

761
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,100
He said he was at an industrial park
on Garner Road.

762
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,460
Is that north of here?

763
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,140
- This is crazy.
- This is what we're paying you for.

764
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,820
Give me one second.

765
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,750
Guys, what's going on?

766
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,630
Daryl, can you believe this?
Your buddy here wants to quit.

767
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,300
Hey. No one's quitting here.
Just give us a minute, Pete.

768
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,030
You got a minute.

769
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,240
You'll be okay. Right?

770
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,740
This is crazy, man, all right?
I mean, a truck almost fell on us.

771
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,980
Relax.

772
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,190
Make it through today, and by next week...

773
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:15,340
...you got cash and you are sitting on a beach
sipping margaritas...

774
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:19,230
...with that beautiful girlfriend of yours.
All right?

775
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,620
- I don't even like margaritas.
- Heh. Trust me.

776
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,260
Come on, we're wasting time.
Daryl, just take his damn camera from him.

777
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,460
He's got this.

778
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,980
- Let's get ready for the next system.
- All right.

779
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,340
Another system?

780
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,670
Wait a minute. That was going north, right?

781
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,520
That's toward the paper mill.

782
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,700
I gotta get there. Can you take us?
My car is totaled.

783
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:42,020
- Sorry. No time.
- His son's out there.

784
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,800
Pete.

785
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,900
Just stay out of the way.

786
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,940
You guys can come in the van with me.

787
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,980
- I can take the kid with the camera.
- Really? Sweet.

788
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,070
No, no, Trey, you're staying with me.

789
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,070
Look, the <i>Titus</i> is the safest place for him.

790
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,380
He's right. It's a tank.
We'll be right behind him.

791
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,070
- Just as far as Garner, okay?
- Right.

792
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:09,140
Keep that camera rolling. When this is over,
I'll give you 3 grand for your tape.

793
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,340
- Three grand?
- Yeah.

794
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,340
- Heh. You got it.
- Now we're talking.

795
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,880
Let's move!

796
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,950
How's your leg?

797
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,150
It's a bit better.

798
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,710
Here.

799
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,110
All right?

800
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,870
Okay.

801
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,700
Where'd you learn that?

802
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,640
My mom was a nurse...

803
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,790
...so when we were kids, instead of
story time, we'd have, like, CPR lessons.

804
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,780
At the time I was kind of lobbying
for <i>Cat in the Hat,</i> but now...

805
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,640
Yeah, thanks, Mom.

806
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,110
- Okay?
- Yeah.

807
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,870
Thanks.

808
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,750
I told my parents I was going to the library.

809
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,190
Your dad is coming, right?

810
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,750
Someone will find us.

811
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,990
You okay?

812
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,510
Look, I waited my whole life
for a storm like this.

813
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,550
Please don't let me down.

814
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,190
Who you trying to reach?

815
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,940
My little girl, Gracie.

816
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,180
I've never been away from her
this long before.

817
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,100
Where is she?

818
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,590
She's with my parents about 200 miles
to the south.

819
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,710
They'll make sure she's safe.

820
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:20,630
Yeah. It just really feels wrong
to be away from her right now. You know?

821
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,340
How old is Gracie?

822
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,590
She just turned 5.

823
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,550
Wow.

824
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,340
- They're a real handful at that age.
- She's a really good kid.

825
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,390
How old is your other son?

826
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,350
Donnie? He's 17.

827
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,750
He'll be all right.
He knows everything at that age.

828
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,070
After his mom died,
I kind of lost him for a while.

829
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,990
We'll find him.

830
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,590
So is this what you guys do for a living?
Go around chasing trouble?

831
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,870
They chase. I study.

832
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,750
Makes me the grown-up. Right, Daryl?

833
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,140
I've never heard
of this many tornadoes before.

834
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,540
It's a freak occurrence.
Two storm fronts taking the same path.

835
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,140
It's not freak anymore.
Not after Katrina. Not after Joplin.

836
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,900
What used to be once-in-a-lifetime
seems to be happening about once a year.

837
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,900
Look what happened with Hurricane Sandy.

838
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,980
Whatever it is, we have to figure it out...

839
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,740
...before they start shifting to places
they've never been before.

840
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,510
- Like where?
- Like Los Angeles. Or Chicago.

841
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,230
Even London.

842
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,700
<i>Tree blocking the road.</i>

843
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,350
- We got a problem.
- Can you get around that?

844
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,900
No.

845
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,620
<i>Moorpark. Right, Dad?</i>

846
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,540
<i>It's about three miles west.
It might be clear that far out.</i>

847
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,740
Good call.

848
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,110
Doubling back to Moorpark.

849
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,030
That's a great boy you've got.

850
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,150
Do you ever think about the last thing
you said to your mom?

851
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:53,070
I think about it every day.

852
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,000
Um...

853
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:59,660
Because I was pissed at her.

854
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,900
I was always pissed at her for something.

855
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,350
For leaving Dad. For leaving me and Trey.

856
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:11,670
We used to spend the weekends with her,
so she was...

857
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,950
She was dropping us back, and she tried
to kiss me goodbye, and I just...

858
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,790
I barely looked at her,
and she walked away.

859
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,840
Yeah, that was it. That was the last time.

860
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,870
What happened?

861
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,030
It was a car accident.

862
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,500
- I'm sorry.
- No.

863
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,150
It's...

864
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,580
You hear that?

865
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,780
Hello?

866
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,660
Hey! Hey, we're down here!

867
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,670
- Hello?
- Please help us!

868
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,060
- What happened?
- I think a pipe burst!

869
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:57,510
My God!

870
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,500
Get on it, Donk. You see anything yet?

871
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:06,190
- I think the twister cloud's up ahead.
- Twister cloud?

872
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,100
Shit! Slow down, Donk!
You're busting my balls!

873
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,300
- Straight over this hill! You'll be fine!
- No! Not the hill!

874
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,920
Hey! Moron!

875
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,660
My God!

876
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,660
Damn! You dumb-ass!

877
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,980
- What the hell, man?
- Whoo! Yeah!

878
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:26,310
- You all right, man?
- Yes!

879
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,150
Whoa.

880
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,390
Aw. This thing's awesome.

881
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,670
- She's a beast.
- Absolutely.

882
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,110
Wow, this is so cool.

883
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,070
You gonna be all right?

884
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,560
Look, I know I yell at you a lot. But listen.

885
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,390
When I first started,
I was scared shitless too.

886
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,460
We got a lot riding on this.
But when the moment comes...

887
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,630
...trust me, you're gonna be fine.

888
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,880
Yes, sir.

889
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,420
You getting this on radar?

890
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,860
I see it. It's headed fast in this direction.

891
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,340
<i>I got three small hook echoes. Maybe four.</i>

892
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,100
- D, you getting any visual on this?
- No. Nothing.

893
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:21,340
I'm not seeing anything, you guys.

894
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,100
What's happening up top, kid?

895
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,670
I got nothing up here. Just clouds.
Wait, there it is. Right there on the left!

896
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,380
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

897
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,160
We got movement to the northeast.

898
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:36,630
Take a look at that!

899
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,630
Guys, it's splitting.

900
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:44,950
<i>- We're gonna have another funnel.</i>
- Something's happening behind us.

901
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,100
There's another one.

902
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,230
There's one to our right!

903
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,390
Two.

904
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,260
There are three. Four!
Shit, they're everywhere!

905
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,230
We have multiple vortices touching down.

906
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,110
These systems are too erratic.
We gotta get out of here.

907
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,030
No, no, no!

908
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,820
Look at that thing!

909
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,360
My God!

910
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,910
God!

911
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,780
Look at the size of that thing!

912
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,540
We're gonna be YouTube stars
for the rest of our lives!

913
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,060
Better than sex, Donk!

914
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:46,350
How would you know?

915
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,860
Dad!

916
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,270
Behind us!

917
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,150
Is everybody all right?

918
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,390
- Yeah.
- I'm okay.

919
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,190
Shit.

920
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,220
- Keep filming!
- Yeah, I got it!

921
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,180
This is unbelievable!

922
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,310
- Dad!
- Are you all right?

923
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,580
I can't get out the side.
We're gonna go through the back.

924
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,950
- Trey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

925
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,110
Let's go!

926
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:05,990
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on. Come on.

927
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,510
- Trey!
- Over here!

928
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,300
We gotta take cover! Everybody in the <i>Titus!</i>
Run! Let's move! Move!

929
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,220
- Come on!
- Let's go!

930
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:18,920
Look out!

931
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,550
Come on!

932
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,300
Everybody head for the church!

933
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,550
- Come on, Trey, stay with me!
- Look out!

934
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,790
Holy shit!

935
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,590
My God!

936
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,350
This is amazing! I gotta get this!

937
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,470
Jake, forget it!

938
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,910
Jake, come on!

939
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,750
Allison!

940
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,100
- Jake!
- Jacob!

941
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,980
- My camera!
- Leave it!

942
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,780
But I gotta get the footage!

943
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,660
Jake, come on! Let's go!

944
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,790
Shit!

945
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,510
- No! No, no, no!
- Come on!

946
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,870
Help me! No, no, no!

947
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,460
- No! Jacob!
- No! He's gone! Allison, he's gone!

948
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:24,860
- Get inside!
- Shut the door!

949
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,480
Come on, come on, come on!

950
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,020
Get down!

951
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:35,720
Okay.

952
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,150
Shit.

953
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,350
Trey. Trey!

954
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,230
I'm here, Dad.

955
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,910
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

956
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:07,030
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting my son.

957
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,420
Please, wait. It isn't safe out there.

958
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,430
What if it was your daughter?

959
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,350
Um...

960
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,980
If we can get the van back on the road, we'll
be safer than we would be on foot. Okay?

961
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:21,030
Pete, can you hook up...?

962
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,160
Is that all you care about?

963
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,740
No. No.

964
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,270
Jacob's dead, Pete.

965
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,760
He'd probably still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

966
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,870
You think what happened is my fault?

967
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,030
I mean, he wasn't out there shooting
for himself, was he?

968
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,860
He was getting your shot for your movie...

969
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:51,500
...because you told him nothing else matters,
and you wouldn't let him go.

970
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,950
No.

971
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,190
It wasn't Pete.

972
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,560
It was me.

973
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,460
I brought him here. It was my fault.

974
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,100
No. No. None of this should have happened.

975
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,060
You gotta help him find his son.

976
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,230
I will. What about you?

977
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,230
I'm gonna stay here.

978
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,110
I'll see if I can find Jacob's parents.
Get in contact with them.

979
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,520
Okay.

980
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,980
Help me close up the gap!

981
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,310
Help me close it up!

982
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,670
- Can you stop it coming in?
- I'm trying!

983
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,350
Lucas, you coming?

984
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,060
Pete...

985
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,750
Suit yourself. I gotta finish this.

986
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,940
Trey, come on. Get in.

987
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,230
- Let's go find your brother.
- All right.

988
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,990
Come on, baby.

989
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,390
Come on.

990
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,500
That's my girl.

991
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,830
Dad, it's getting worse out there.

992
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,870
Still no signal.

993
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:25,180
My phone. It's not working.

994
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,390
Try yours.

995
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,190
No, there's no signal.

996
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,740
- Try it through the gap right there.
- Okay.

997
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,070
Your arm can fit.

998
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:38,780
- My God. There's a bar, there's a bar.
- Put it on speakerphone!

999
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,860
<i>This is Gary. Leave a message.</i>

1000
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,180
Dad! Dad! Please help us!

1001
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,420
The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring in...

1002
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,700
...and I don't know how long we've got!

1003
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,150
Dad!

1004
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:53,300
Shit!

1005
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,430
Shit.

1006
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,300
I'm sorry. It's dead.

1007
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,230
I'm sorry.

1008
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:10,820
Are you folks all right?
I'm taking these people to the shelter.

1009
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:14,300
- You been by the industrial park?
- Sure have. Whole place has been flattened.

1010
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:17,700
- Did you see anyone? A boy? A girl?
- I didn't see anybody. I'm sorry.

1011
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,860
- Maybe he made it to the school.
- What if he didn't? We gotta go.

1012
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,860
Listen. I heard on the radio,
all the warning sirens are down.

1013
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,350
If a tornado's coming,
you're not gonna know it.

1014
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,630
Okay.

1015
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,900
Mom.

1016
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,550
Dad.

1017
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,520
I just wanna thank you for everything.

1018
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:48,360
I was gonna come down the stairs
this morning to say goodbye...

1019
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:51,060
...but when I came you were already gone.

1020
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,420
I got a message.

1021
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,060
<i>Dad! Dad! Please help us!</i>

1022
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,100
<i>The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring in...</i>

1023
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,470
<i>- ...and I don't know how long we've got!</i>
- My God.

1024
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,310
You should know I'm not alone.

1025
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,710
Donnie's here.

1026
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,350
He's been really sweet.

1027
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:23,950
So it's kind of okay.

1028
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,030
I love you so much.

1029
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,630
Guess what.

1030
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:44,350
I spent the last week filming time capsules
about people's futures...

1031
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,790
...and now it looks like I don't have one.

1032
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:51,590
So...

1033
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,270
...if there's no future...

1034
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,350
...we should talk about the past.

1035
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,150
Um...

1036
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,260
Some bad shit happened along the way.

1037
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,470
You know, like it does to everybody, I guess.

1038
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,080
And...

1039
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,830
And I didn't move on, Dad. I blamed you.

1040
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:18,510
I really gave you shit, and I wish I hadn't.

1041
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:23,310
I so wish I hadn't.

1042
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,270
No point in wishing now?

1043
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,310
What do I wanna say? Um...

1044
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,950
Go easy on Trey.

1045
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:39,310
He's gonna tell you that this is all his fault.

1046
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:42,380
This was his idea. But it wasn't.

1047
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,560
It's just Trey. His attention-seeking behavior.

1048
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,710
My idea.

1049
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,750
My fault.

1050
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:58,150
Trey, you should be the person you always
were, dude, because you're awesome.

1051
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,260
You're awesome and I'm proud of you...

1052
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,260
...and just live every day like it's your last.

1053
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,710
Because, shit, someday it will be.

1054
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,230
And for once, I know what I'm talking about.

1055
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,840
And, Dad...

1056
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,310
Dad, I love you.

1057
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:24,550
I really love you and I'm sorry.

1058
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,590
Okay, I'm sorry.

1059
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,830
Okay. Sorry.

1060
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,190
Sorry.

1061
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,620
Come here.

1062
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,140
Okay.

1063
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,390
All right.

1064
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,870
Come on.

1065
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,760
Take a left here.

1066
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,040
Donnie!

1067
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:20,500
Donnie!

1068
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,780
Trey!

1069
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:23,830
Look!

1070
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,380
Hello?

1071
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,000
It's Donnie's!

1072
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,140
Donnie!

1073
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,390
Donnie!

1074
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,100
Where are you?

1075
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,500
Kaitlyn!

1076
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,670
Over here!

1077
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,620
He said there was water pouring in, right?

1078
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,540
Dad! Over here!

1079
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,020
Listen! Nobody move!

1080
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,220
We're over here!

1081
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:48,030
- Donnie!
- Dad!

1082
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,660
- Where is he?
- It's okay.

1083
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,950
- Donnie, I'm here!
- We got you.

1084
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,300
It's okay! I'm here! I got you!
It's Dad! Can you hear me?

1085
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,790
Dad! Trey!

1086
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:00,500
Dad!

1087
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:03,100
Dad, you've gotta help him!

1088
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:05,260
Can you swim through? There's a gap here!

1089
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,590
Now you hold on!

1090
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:07,870
Donnie!

1091
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,900
Gary, I can't move it!

1092
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:15,350
We gotta move this! We gotta move
this I-beam! Come on, push it!

1093
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,310
- It's not gonna move.
- Dad!

1094
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,300
- Donnie, you're okay.
- Help me get her out.

1095
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,500
You're doing good.

1096
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,910
We're gonna get you out.

1097
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,150
Trey, what are you doing?

1098
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,780
Watch out!

1099
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,420
Okay, I need you to duck down!

1100
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:32,380
We're gonna move this beam!
You understand?

1101
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,750
Got it!

1102
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,310
You guys Okay?

1103
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,350
I got it. I got it. All right.

1104
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,140
- Kaitlyn, come on.
- Are you okay?

1105
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,670
- I got you, I got you.
- Let's go, let's go. Get her out.

1106
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,920
Donnie!

1107
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:08,160
Donnie!

1108
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,580
- Donnie!
- I got him.

1109
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,900
Pull him up!

1110
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,380
I got his head.

1111
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,950
Get him up.

1112
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:48,300
Donnie?

1113
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,940
Right here. Here we go.

1114
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,620
Donnie!

1115
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,110
Donnie?

1116
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:55,310
Put this under his head.

1117
01:03:56,110 --> 01:03:57,860
He's not breathing!

1118
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,480
God!

1119
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,230
- Donnie!
- My God.

1120
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,710
Donnie!

1121
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,510
Breathe!

1122
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,280
Come on!

1123
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:36,910
Go on. Cough it up. There you go.
Come here.

1124
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,270
There you go, son. Cough it up.

1125
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,710
Here. It's okay.

1126
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,140
I got you.

1127
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:46,180
- Kaitlyn.
- It's okay. She's here.

1128
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,910
It's okay.

1129
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,780
I love you, son.

1130
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,380
We got him now. We got him now.

1131
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:53,780
Come here.

1132
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,740
- I love you both.
- Donnie.

1133
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,830
So much.

1134
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,900
I thought you might need some help.

1135
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:16,270
Never thought I'd be happy
to see your face again.

1136
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,580
Getting my hard drives.

1137
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:22,620
- You were down there?
- Yeah.

1138
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,910
Camera rolling?

1139
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:28,350
Yeah, there's the guy I know.

1140
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,420
- Guys, we gotta get out of here.
- Come on.

1141
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,040
Everybody in the <i>Titus.</i>

1142
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,510
<i>We are tracking a massive tornado.</i>

1143
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,860
Pete, you seeing this?

1144
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,180
<i>- There's a second tornado formation.</i>
- I see it.

1145
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,340
<i>This storm is heading northwest.
There. And it just touched down.</i>

1146
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:51,340
<i>We now have two very large tornadoes
moving towards the town of Silverton.</i>

1147
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:54,820
<i>All residents of Shaw County
should seek shelter immediately.</i>

1148
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:58,300
<i>They are converging, which could
generate wind speeds of up to a...</i>

1149
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,990
<i>There! There they go!
They just converged.</i>

1150
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:05,340
<i>We are looking at wind speeds inside
the funnel of over 300 miles per hour.</i>

1151
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:07,790
<i>This is definitely an EF5.</i>

1152
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:10,310
This is the biggest tornado I've ever seen.

1153
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,860
- The school.
- The whole town's in there.

1154
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:20,150
Warning systems are out.

1155
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,470
They're sitting ducks.

1156
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:38,150
Okay, everybody out. Now. Let's go.

1157
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:39,340
Hurry! Get out! Go!

1158
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,420
What are you doing? You out of your mind?

1159
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:45,180
- There is another tornado heading this way.
- And you want us to go outside?

1160
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,060
- You don't understand.
- You have to.

1161
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,220
This is the storm shelter, for chrissake.

1162
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,140
- Not for this.
- Would you believe us?

1163
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:53,140
We've been out there.
We know what this can do.

1164
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:56,220
I am not going to risk it.
I've got hundreds of people here.

1165
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:58,510
You will have hundreds of dead people
if you stay.

1166
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,860
Sir. I've studied storms all my life,
all right?

1167
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:04,180
This is bigger than any storm
that has ever been. Can you hear that?

1168
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,180
- It will flatten this building in seconds.
- Exactly.

1169
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,550
With or without you, we're getting
these people onto those buses.

1170
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,550
- Trey, stay with me. Stay close.
- Okay.

1171
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,840
Come on, everybody!
Get on the buses! Move!

1172
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,390
We gotta go.

1173
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:26,990
That one! That one over there!

1174
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,710
- Stay with us!
- Let's go! Let's go!

1175
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:31,660
Come on, move!

1176
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,750
Trey, put the camera down
and get on the bus.

1177
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,860
- I'm coming.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

1178
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:37,230
Come on, folks.

1179
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,710
Come on! Let's go!

1180
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:44,700
Everybody on. Move, move, move.

1181
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,150
Come on, get in there.

1182
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:47,630
Trey, get in.

1183
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:52,430
- Come on, Trey, come on, come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

1184
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,870
Hold on.

1185
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,380
Holy shit. Lucas, you getting this?

1186
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,350
Yeah. We good.

1187
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,950
- How we looking?
- It's still picking up speed.

1188
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:44,110
Dad! Dad, the tower's coming down!

1189
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:50,400
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look out!
- Hang on!

1190
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:08,780
Dad, be careful!

1191
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:12,140
- We can't get through. There's no way around.
- We don't have any time.

1192
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:14,830
- We gotta go back.
- Okay.

1193
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:17,860
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1194
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:21,350
Come in the bus.
Come in the bus with us.

1195
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:26,120
You guys, we gotta back up!
We gotta go back and find a road!

1196
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,870
Gary, we need cover.
We can't stay in the open.

1197
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,990
It's moving too fast.
We're not gonna outrun it.

1198
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:39,430
<i>The road's blocked. We gotta turn around.</i>

1199
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:42,140
- No, Dad, pull over up here.
- What?

1200
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:46,510
Dad, trust me, okay? I filmed here.
There's a storm drain. Right over there.

1201
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,760
- Okay, everybody get off.
- All right, come on! Come on!

1202
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,670
All right, this way!

1203
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:00,720
Come on, you guys. Let's go. Let's go.

1204
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:03,340
- Come on!
- Follow me this way!

1205
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:07,030
Dad! Dad! We can't get in this way!

1206
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,580
- Go in through the manhole!
- Manhole?

1207
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,630
- You got a crowbar?
- Yeah.

1208
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,430
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Lucas!

1209
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,310
Come on.

1210
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:18,910
Here we go.

1211
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:31,830
- Okay, everybody in.
- Everybody in!

1212
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:34,700
- Come on. Let's go. Go! Go!
- Okay. Okay. Donnie!

1213
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,750
Get in.

1214
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:40,750
Jesus!

1215
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:44,430
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

1216
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,190
Come on!

- Now! Hurry up!
- Come on, come on!

1218
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:56,910
Lucas, get in! Go, move! Go!

1219
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,350
- Right behind me, guys!
- Yeah, go!

1220
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,870
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1221
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:11,200
- Give me a hand.
- I got it.

1222
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:15,190
- Close it!
- Come on!

1223
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:14,580
Shit!

1224
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:18,390
- You guys all right?
- The truck opened the other end! Hang on!

1225
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:21,100
It's gonna be a wind tunnel in here!
Hold on tight!

1226
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:23,300
- My God, the grate's loose!
- Hold on!

1227
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:26,510
- We're gonna get sucked out!
- Keep your head down!

1228
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:34,340
Hey, this footage and data
could save lives one day!

1229
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,630
What are you doing?

1230
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,160
Pete?

1231
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:41,780
- No, no! Wait!
- Allison!

1232
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,110
Pete!

1233
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,830
Pete!

1234
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:51,990
Lucas! Give me that!

1235
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,750
Peter, please, come back!

1236
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,700
Gary!

1237
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:34,150
No! Allison! I can't reach!

1238
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,870
Give me your hand!

1239
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:47,750
Come on!

1240
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,380
Come on. Come here!

1241
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:54,230
Allison! Here. Come on.

1242
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,820
You okay?

1243
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,360
Yeah.

1244
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,190
Okay, anchor down.

1245
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:10,030
- What's he doing?
- He's trying to plug the hole!

1246
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,720
Damn it. She won't stay anchored.

1247
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,750
Allison! Allison!

1248
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,060
<i>Can you hitch the winch to something solid?</i>

1249
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,430
- The truck!
- Yeah.

1250
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,790
- The release.
- Here.

1251
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,630
Okay, I got it.

1252
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:04,100
- We're good!
- All right, Pete, we're set.

1253
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:05,960
<i>You can tighten her up.</i>

1254
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:30,660
Okay, then.

1255
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:33,840
<i>Titus</i> versus tornado.

1256
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:41,230
- Dad, hang on!
- Gary!

1257
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:56,230
Hang on!

1258
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,860
Is that it? Is it over?

1259
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:39,910
Pete, what's happening? Did it pass us?

1260
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:49,540
It's not gonna last.

1261
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,400
We're in the eye.

1262
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:54,070
God.

1263
01:16:56,430 --> 01:17:00,110
Guys, the trailing winds will be
even stronger! You've gotta hang on!

1264
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,350
Okay.

1265
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:05,310
Hold on tight.

1266
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,640
Hold on!

1267
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,790
Donnie! Get down!

1268
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,940
It's not gonna hold!

1269
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:57,310
Peter!

1270
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,150
No!

1271
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,830
Grab my hand! No!

1272
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,830
- No!
- Gary!

1273
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:41,540
<i>And let's see. We're gonna stay right here.</i>

1274
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:43,100
<i>We're gonna see if it re-cycles.</i>

1275
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,540
<i>It's becoming more of a barrel-shaped.</i>

1276
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:49,860
<i>The wedge has decreased a little bit, and it
looks like it's roping out at Air Depot Road.</i>

1277
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:51,500
<i>Look at the rope on that thing.</i>

1278
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:55,460
<i>Feeder band looks like it's pretty low
to the ground. It's way</i> lower <i>than we</i> are.

1279
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:58,190
<i>There it is. It's gone, Mike.</i>

1280
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:08,380
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.

1281
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:11,110
- Yeah, we're good.
- You're okay.

1282
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:15,680
Trey?

1283
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:48,420
<i>This was a storm that was on
the ground for at least 10 miles before it hit.</i>

1284
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:51,820
<i>...assault by giant tornadoes.
And look how powerful they are.</i>

1285
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:55,140
<i>One tornado is already
being called the largest tornado in history.</i>

1286
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,340
<i>The intense storm that set off the twisters...</i>

1287
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,350
<i>...dropped golf ball to baseball-sized hail.</i>

1288
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:03,980
<i>There's no denying the tragedy
that we've all endured here today.</i>

1289
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:05,820
<i>But you know...</i>

1290
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:09,670
<i>...our faith will carry us through,
and we will rebuild.</i>

1291
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,870
I'm sorry about Pete.

1292
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,220
Hey, little bug.

1293
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:31,980
Hey.

1294
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:34,260
No, Mama's okay. I'm okay.

1295
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:35,860
I am. I promise.

1296
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:38,020
I'm coming home.

1297
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:40,540
Yeah, Mama's coming home.

1298
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,830
I love you too.

1299
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:51,910
<i>In 25 years?</i>

1300
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:56,300
It doesn't matter, you know?

1301
01:21:56,310 --> 01:22:00,300
Just taking it one day at a time.

1302
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:02,790
Every day's just fine.

1303
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:05,940
Because I'm alive.

1304
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,580
That's it.

1305
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,200
Nothing else matters.

1306
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:14,380
Sometimes I think the human race
as a species is crazy.

1307
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:17,220
But when the chips are down...

1308
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:20,100
...ordinary people, like you and me...

1309
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:21,660
...are good.

1310
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,230
I like that.

1311
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:26,110
You know, Pete and I had our moments...

1312
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:30,460
...but I know why he got up every morning.

1313
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:32,580
And I know why he gave up his life.

1314
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:35,150
He wanted to make a difference and...

1315
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,030
Um...

1316
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:41,550
Well, hopefully this film
will help accomplish that.

1317
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:50,500
To be honest,
it didn't look good back there.

1318
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:51,940
But we made it.

1319
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:54,940
We stuck together, and here we are.

1320
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,670
Alive.

1321
01:22:56,990 --> 01:23:00,660
I'm just grateful that we'll be able
to look back on this in 25 years.

1322
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:04,620
Twenty-five years?
Wow. You are gonna be so old.

1323
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:06,100
- Heh.
- And probably bald too.

1324
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,500
All right, you're cut off.

1325
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:10,150
Donnie, you have something
you wanna say?

1326
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:16,300
I don't think we really have
to say anything, you know?

1327
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:19,030
We're all here now. Together.

1328
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,460
And that's all that matters.

1329
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,470
Yeah, it is.

1330
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:26,910
Okay. Let's get back to work.

1331
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:34,220
<i>Hey! Donk!</i>

1332
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:36,380
<i>Donk, where are you?</i>

1333
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:38,350
Over here!

1334
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,820
Hey, you're upside down!

1335
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:43,630
No, you're upside down! And you're in a tree!

1336
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:45,540
Well, so are you!

1337
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:46,740
Yeah.

1338
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,820
That camera still working?

1339
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:51,020
Yeah, it is!

1340
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:54,310
Man, we are gonna be so rich!

1341
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,810
<i>Shit! Donk!</i>
