1
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,990
The future

2
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,390
The polar ice caps have melted

3
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,190
covering the Earth with water

4
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,750
Those who survived have adapted...

5
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,750
to a new world.

6
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,030
Bad luck, English.

7
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,550
But the Slavers are producing a good grade of poxy these days.

8
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,510
Cost you a handful of dirt... or maybe that wind chime.

9
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,390
- What are you doin' here? - Just waiting.

10
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,430
Take your hand off the sail.

11
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,070
Take it off!

12
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,830
I've seen your boat before. Haven't seen you.

13
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,670
Took it legal.

14
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,710
Previous owner was dead on the tiller when I found it.

15
00:05:57,745 --> 00:06:00,670
You had another hour before I traded up again.

16
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,390
Just improving my means.

17
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,270
- Well, I owe you then. - No, thanks.

18
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,510
I got all the supplies I need. Just came from an atoll.

19
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,550
Eight days east, if you're interested.

20
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,430
- Two drifters meet, something needs to be exchanged. - I know the code.

21
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,150
But I'll give you this one for free.

22
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,590
Nothing's free in Waterworld.

23
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,910
Ha-ha. Yeah.

24
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:30,150
Ha-ha. Yeah.

25
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,790
Smokers.

26
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,870
Just enough wind to get away clean.

27
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,790
Forget the bag.

28
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,710
It's not worth it. You'll never make it with your sails down.

29
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,350
Hey!

30
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,390
What can I say?

31
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,830
- Joe, he's goin' for it. - What the hell?

32
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,910
Never seen that before.

33
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,990
Here we go! Go! Drive! Drive!

34
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,270
Faster! Faster! Whoo!

35
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,350
Come on! He's gonna get it! He's gonna get it!

36
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,310
- Pick her up! - Get it! Get it!

37
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,750
Oh, no!

38
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,910
Inbound! Straight out from the gates.

39
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,430
English.

40
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,030
Flag's down, drifter. We got enough traders.

41
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,430
Dirt.

42
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,430
Open the gates!

43
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,070
Bones to berries.

44
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,390
Veins to vine.

45
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,630
These tendons to trees. This blood to brine.

46
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,390
Too old she was.

47
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,210
This woman does leave us

48
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,870
ecycled and enshrined in the presence of Him who leads us.

49
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,510
What is that?

50
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,470
You know me?

51
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,470
I know what you are.

52
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,190
Good. Then you know if you look for trouble while you're here,

53
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,470
you'll find more than you can handle.

54
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,190
You got two hours.

55
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,830
I'll only need one.

56
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,510
He's comin' over here.

57
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,870
- Me. - You each get one...

58
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,510
if everything's here when I get back.

59
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,070
Pure dirt.

60
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,630
3.2 kilos.

61
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,830
How'd you come by so much of it?

62
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,710
Another atoll 30 horizons west of here.

63
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,870
Where'd they get it?

64
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,110
- They didn't say. - We heard about that place...

65
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,790
that they was all killed.

66
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,790
- That's why they didn't say. - Smokers?

67
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,030
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.

68
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,230
So what's the word? We tradin' or not?

69
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,110
We'll tally it like, uh, pure hydro.

70
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,710
Works out to... 62 chits.

71
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,630
I want twice that.

72
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,350
- I just want one sip of hydro! - No, not 'til you tell me.

73
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,790
She got inkings on her back. I seen her.

74
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,990
They say if you read the marks on the child,

75
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,590
they'll lead ya all the way to Dryland.

76
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,750
- Dryland's a myth. - Some still believe.

77
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,870
They say the Smokers even got an eye out for her.

78
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,670
Well, then, we'd better keep it to ourselves.

79
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,190
- Help you? - Yeah.

80
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,670
- Where's the store? - You found it.

81
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,230
You don't have much.

82
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,110
You the man with the dirt?

83
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,190
Skoal.

84
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,350
- One more. - Make it two.

85
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,230
A man this rich will buy for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

86
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,750
One.

87
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,990
That's an interesting pair of boots you got.

88
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,190
- Trade? - No.

89
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,350
Shame.

90
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:46,770
That's her

91
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,070
Enola. Hey, what are you doing?

92
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,390
No, you can't do that.

93
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,670
I need another piece.

94
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,950
I want to draw some more.

95
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,710
I'll get it to you. Just stay in the back.

96
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,870
With all those chits, you could order up a bath.

97
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,210
Have you ever had a freshwater bath?

98
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,470
Why are you talkin' to me?

99
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,470
Just being friendly.

100
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,150
- Is that a tomato plant? - Yeah.

101
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,390
You have a keen eye.

102
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,470
Saw one in a picture. How much?

103
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,790
Half your chits.

104
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,310
- I'll take them too. - Take what?

105
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,390
- You bought everything. - I'll take them shelves.

106
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,390
So, what did you see out there in your 15 months?

107
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,030
- Such as? - An end to all this water.

108
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,710
Askin' the wrong person.

109
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,790
The one they buried today?

110
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,270
She found the only end there is.

111
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,350
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.

112
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,963
I'm not staying. 

113
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,616
We're not asking you to.

114
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,270
All we want is your seed.

115
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,470
We can look to our own for impregnation,

116
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,990
but too much of that sort of thing gets... undesirable.

117
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,030
When she's pregnant

118
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,790
you go on your way with all the supplies you need.

119
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,830
You don't have anything. You're dying.

120
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,150
No man stays out that long and turns down a woman.

121
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,830
- He's hiding something. - Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

122
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,350
When the elders say so, you can leave,

123
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,350
and not before.

124
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,430
Gills.

125
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,510
- Mutation! - He's a mutant!

126
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,390
My hand!

127
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,070
Throw the nets!

128
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,470
By what right...

129
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,910
You pay me to keep the peace.

130
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,910
This isn't it.

131
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,310
- He has killed one of ours. - He was defending himself.

132
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,643
He needs to be destroyed!

133
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:35,896
Kill him. Let's kill him.

134
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:37,150
That may be,

135
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,470
but not here and not like this.

136
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,470
What is it?

137
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,470
Damn.

138
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,950
It's tied. I can't get it off.

139
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,630
Open the gate.

140
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,310
Is it a map?

141
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,110
You'd tell me if you knew, wouldn't you, Enola?

142
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,390
- What are you drawing? - I don't know.

143
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,310
Helen, look. Look at the prodigal child's latest vision.

144
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,610
How soon before we can leave?

145
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,150
I don't have any idea yet where we can go.

146
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,510
I haven't figured out the tattoo on her back.

147
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,230
I'm a stupid man. The answer's right there.

148
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,310
It's just beyond me.

149
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,390
Maybe he knows.

150
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,550
Oh, yes, I see. They are webbed.

151
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,530
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

152
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,430
eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.

153
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,470
They tell me, too, that you have gills.

154
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,270
Isotropic gills. Are they merely vestigial or are they functional now?

155
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,750
My name is Gregor. I've just come to pay you a little vi... vi...

156
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,590
Oh, my God.

157
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,750
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.

158
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,830
I'm excited. Your gills. They're functional.

159
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,590
Icthyus sapien. You can breathe in the water.

160
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,550
How deep can you go? Look, I'm only here...

161
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,230
Look, l'm only here because I want to learn more about you.

162
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,390
I can't say that I blame you. But tell me:

163
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,150
- I have no "kind." - Oh, fish rot.

164
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,590
I'd be surprised if there weren't others, and if there aren't,

165
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,110
there will be eventually.

166
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,470
Anyway, I've come here because I need to ask you a question.

167
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,470
Where... Where did your dirt come from?

168
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,870
Is it from Dryland?

169
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,190
Do you know what this is?

170
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,510
The ancients... They did something terrible, didn't they?

171
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,350
To cause all this water. Hundreds... Hundreds of years ago.

172
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,430
If I tell you, will you open this lock?

173
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,750
I haven't a key.

174
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,590
- There's a mooring cleat down there. - What?

175
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,670
- Good as any key. - A mooring cleat?

176
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,550
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.

177
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,310
What's your business there?

178
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,470
- Move along! - I'm not a brave man.

179
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,750
If you know anything about Dryland, please tell me. Please!

180
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,190
Don't let it die with you.

181
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,830
No, no, no, no. Stop!

182
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,270
it is our decision that this mute-o...

183
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,550
does, indeed, constitute a threat.

184
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,590
Therefore, in the interest of public safety,

185
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,230
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled...

186
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,190
in the customary fashion.

187
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,990
Proceed.

188
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,790
I'm sorry.

189
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,710
Bones to berries.

190
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,430
Veins to vines.

191
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,270
His tendons to trees. His blood to brine.

192
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,430
Too strange for life he was.

193
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,910
This mute-o now does leave us,

194
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,830
recycled and entombed, in the presence of him who leads us.

195
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,790
Smokers! Dead out of the sun!

196
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,470
To your posts!

197
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,990
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

198
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,030
- Kill! - There!

199
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,950
We are safe behind these walls.

200
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,470
Aren't we?

201
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,390
Let me out!

202
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,430
Let me out! I'll fight!

203
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,750
Give me the key to the city now.

204
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,870
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

205
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,510
Floor it! Floor it! Floor it!

206
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,030
Swab it! Swab it!

207
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,790
Goddamn! More ammo!

208
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,150
Break down the door!

209
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,070
My God!

210
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,630
Ha!

211
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,830
We'll have this atoll in no time.

212
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,990
Crank it! Crank it!

213
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,430
Look!

214
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,150
Look out!

215
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,750
Oh, no!

216
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,510
You get that goin'! Fill 'em up!

217
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,750
Helen, come quickly!

218
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,910
Helen!

219
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,310
You're not supposed to go yet!

220
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,830
Infernal machine!

221
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,070
Gregor. Gregor, wait!

222
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,870
Helen, I tried. There was an accident.

223
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,590
I can't make it stop. Hurry!

224
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,990
You can make it if you try. Run! Up those stairs. Run! Quickly!

225
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,230
- Wait! Wait! - I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly!

226
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,310
- Throw the rope now. Run, Enola. - Slow down! Wait!

227
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,310
- Throw the rope. No! No! - Wait!

228
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,110
- Gregor, don't leave us! - Oh, no!

229
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,310
I'm sorry! It was an accident!

230
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:46,630
Helen! Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!

231
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,950
Shoot him. Shoot him.

232
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,190
If I let you out of here, you're taking us with you.

233
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,390
Sure.

234
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,350
Enola, get down.

235
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,230
Here. Get over here. Get down.

236
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,230
Hurry! Come on!

237
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,670
Get the gate.

238
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,190
Run!

239
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,390
Hurry up!

240
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,390
Kamikazes. Come on!

241
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,110
That made a hole.

242
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,230
Find her! Get the girl!

243
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,390
There!

244
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,590
Go get that guy! Go! Kill him!

245
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,190
- Wow! - Enola!

246
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,590
- You're too slow! - Run to the other side.

247
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,630
Come on!

248
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,030
Grab on! Hold on, hold on.

249
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,110
I'm stuck! I can't make it through!

250
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,950
Let her go!

251
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,990
Just drop her!

252
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,470
Turn the wheel. The wheel! Turn it!

253
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,390
That! Come on! Push it!

254
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,150
- I am! - Hurry! Now pull!

255
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,190
Push it! Push it hard! Push it hard!

256
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,230
Okay, okay! Now pull this! Pull this!

257
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,670
Pull! Pull it! Hurry!

258
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,230
Enola, jump.

259
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,030
- Look at me. Jump! Now! - Okay!

260
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,110
Well, excuse me!

261
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,550
Did I say anybody could leave before the battle was over?

262
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,550
- Did I? - No! No!

263
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,110
Well, do somethin'. I hate sails.

264
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,550
Hey! Can you steer?

265
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,550
Can I trust you?

266
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,630
Answer me this, somebody. Why is that boat still firin'?

267
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,430
- What's that cousin's name? - Chuck.

268
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,630
- Hey, Chuck! - He's pulling him right into us.

269
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,970
Maybe he doesn't answer to "Chuck."

270
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,230
Call him "Charles." Charles!

271
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,350
Stop him! Stop him!

272
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,790
Charles!

273
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,590
Adios, cousins.

274
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,630
She's here somewhere. Keep lookin'.

275
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,350
Stop it!

276
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,570
What you got?

277
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,390
Couple of heartbeats over there. Aren't sayin' much.

278
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,890
If you'll notice the arterial nature of the blood

279
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,510
comin' from the hole in my head,

280
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,870
you can assume that we're all havin' a real lousy day.

281
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,790
So here it is: I need to know about that tattooed girl.

282
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,670
First one that tells me lives.

283
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,150
I saw a girl. I saw, I saw...

284
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,550
It was... Sh-She had a big tattoo on her.

285
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,715
You won. Start over.

286
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,910
I saw a girl. I'm not sure,

287
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,790
but I think she got on that boat with three hulls.

288
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,250
The boat that cost me a thousand G's of go-juice?

289
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,390
Yeah, the mute-o's boat.

290
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,390
- Mute-o? - Yeah. He got these slits here.

291
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,750
Like... Like fish gills.

292
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,190
He wasn't really a man.

293
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,830
A fluke of evolution.

294
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,750
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of, uh...

295
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,310
- Evolution. - I know!

296
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,270
- No! No, you said you wouldn't kill me! - Did I say that?

297
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,430
- Witnesses, anybody, did I? - Yes, yes, yes! You said...

298
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,950
- You said it. - Oh, I may have.

299
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,910
I may have.

300
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,390
tank up that sky boat; send it out on patrol.

301
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,350
We gotta keep an eye out...

302
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,750
for that ichthy-freak.

303
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,630
You been there, haven't you?

304
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,950
Dryland?

305
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,310
You know where it is.

306
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,310
Yeah, I know where it is.

307
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,950
And, uh... And we're going?

308
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,990
You and I are.

309
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,750
The kid we gotta pitch over the side.

310
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,630
- What? - My boat's tore up.

311
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,270
I'm takin' on water.

312
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,710
I'd be lucky to get half a hydro ration out of that.

313
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,470
You know... I said I won't drink.

314
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,990
For 12 days?

315
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,590
No. It's better one of you dies now...

316
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,710
than both of you die slow.

317
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,910
Wait. Wait.

318
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,550
We saved your life. We got you out.

319
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,670
No, you got me out so you could get out. We're even.

320
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,750
She can cook. She can fish.

321
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,030
- So can I. - Then take my necklace. Take my necklace.

322
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,470
- I got better ones below. - No, look!

323
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,430
Oh.

324
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,550
After what you went through back there on the atoll,

325
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,710
I can understand why you would want to.

326
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,790
But she's a child.

327
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,350
Is there something else then?

328
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,350
Enola! Go below.

329
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,430
Enola.

330
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,950
Yeah. You said so yourself.

331
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,670
Been out there a long time.

332
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,430
Couple hours ago, I was potential dirt to you.

333
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,870
- We're not like that. - You all are.

334
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,750
Know what I was really thinkin'?

335
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,950
Why I don't drop both of you in my wake right now.

336
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,830
You got nothin' I need.

337
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,070
You're taking us to Dryland.

338
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,390
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

339
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,790
- Believe me. I'm not the one to start on. - Both of us!

340
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,870
How long you plan to hold that on me?

341
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,070
As long as it takes.

342
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,750
- Okay. - No!

343
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,590
Let me out of here!

344
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,510
Where the hell are you? Don't you touch my child.

345
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,550
Come here!

346
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,470
Okay, now don't move, okay? There.

347
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,870
Ohh. Oh, lookin' real good, yeah.

348
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,230
There. There.

349
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,230
All done.

350
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,270
Now, there may be some small problem in depth perception.

351
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,230
Well, it better not screw up my short game.

352
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,150
- Well? - Looks good. I like it. Yeah.

353
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,270
- I like it better than your real eye. - Much better.

354
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,950
- What do you say, Toby? The truth. - Looks like shit.

355
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,910
That's why I love children. No guile.

356
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,710
It does look like shit.

357
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,710
And it feels like cold shit!

358
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,190
Deacon? What...

359
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,790
I'm sorry. L-lt's just that there's a problem in the pit.

360
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,790
Maybe you should come.

361
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,710
Let's drive.

362
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,950
The pit. Don't bother with the scenic route.

363
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,950
Drive!

364
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,230
Hey, it's drivin' better.

365
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,590
Get off!

366
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,990
Get over there. Get out of the way.

367
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,150
All right, all right, all right. Okay, okay.

368
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,910
You guys are great. Bless all you cousins over there.

369
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,390
Keep up the good work. Growth is progress. Growth is progress.

370
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,070
Somebody! Hey, up there!

371
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,110
Take it off!

372
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,910
- Yes. - Your Deaconship.

373
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,950
Hello. Good morning. Or night,

374
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,590
whichever the case may be.

375
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,390
- What is it? I'm a busy man. - I thought you should know.

376
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,150
We're down to exactly...

377
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,190
four feet, nine inches of black stuff.

378
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,630
Thank you, sir.

379
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,030
How many G's is that after refinin'?

380
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,390
Maybe three refuelers.

381
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,110
- We'll burn through that in two lunars. - Sweet Joe!

382
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,870
Will somebody please tell me what's happened to this place?

383
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,950
We outgrowed it.

384
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,910
All right, the only thing that is important is the tattooed girl.

385
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,310
We don't spare any go-juice findin' her.

386
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,910
We don't waste it anywhere else.

387
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,430
You cancel all those tractor pulls...

388
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,390
and all that stuff until later.

389
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,430
You got it?

390
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,910
Dryland is the mother lode.

391
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,030
On your toes.

392
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,390
Excellent.

393
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,230
- Hi. - Move.

394
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,750
Enola! Enola, come here!

395
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,950
Come on!

396
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,910
Enola, come over here.

397
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,150
Hey!

398
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,990
- What are ya doin'? - Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

399
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,230
- Where did you get this? - From down below.

400
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,030
This is mine! You don't touch anything of mine.

401
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,000
I drew it for you. 

402
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,430
You don't draw on anything. You understand?

403
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,990
What...

404
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,190
This is my boat. I got it the way I like it.

405
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,070
You take up space and you slow me down.

406
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,550
You know, she's just a little girl.

407
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,870
- She doesn't know your rules. - You wanna stay?

408
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,910
You teach her.

409
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,430
Enola, what'd I tell you?

410
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,190
You're not so tough. You know that?

411
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,390
How many people have you killed?

412
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,110
Ten? Twenty?

413
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,550
- You talk a lot. - I talk a lot 'cause you don't talk at all.

414
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,590
Now how many?

415
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,230
- Including little girls? - I'm not afraid of you.

416
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,310
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly if you cut your hair.

417
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,350
In fact, you talk all the time.

418
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,510
- It's like a storm when you're around. - Enola!

419
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,230
Hey! What are you doing?

420
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,390
- Helen! - You bastard! She can't swim!

421
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,390
Help me! Helen!

422
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,030
Helen, help me!

423
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,590
Helen!

424
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,830
Helen, help me!

425
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,990
Helen! Helen!

426
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,510
Hold on!

427
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,070
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

428
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,110
Oh, please, come back. Please!

429
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,590
Please! Oh, please!

430
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,110
Hey!

431
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:06,070
Hold on. Okay, almost...

432
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,510
there.

433
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,670
Thanks. I swear,

434
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,630
if you ever touch her again...

435
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,990
You son of a bitch. Look at me.

436
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,510
You will go to bed that night, and you will never wake up.

437
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,310
- Shut up. - What?

438
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:35,030
- Smokers? - Yeah.

439
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,310
Can't we outrun them?

440
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:41,310
Not with my sail down.

441
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,510
- What are you thinkin' about? - That's a nice touch.

442
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,510
That's them.

443
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,550
Don't hit the kid.

444
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,990
Hey!

445
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,990
Coward!

446
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,470
Fuck!

447
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,630
No!

448
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,470
Cut it!

449
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,550
Come on! Come on!

450
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,550
All right. Okay.

451
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,750
Oh, I'm really sorry.

452
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,910
I'm sorry. But you didn't give me much choice.

453
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,950
Oh, I know.

454
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,790
But you ran away. L... What?

455
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,750
What are you do... No! Please, no! No!

456
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:58,230
Don't ever touch anything on my boat again.

457
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,550
She said she was sorry!

458
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,390
That means you're supposed to say something back!

459
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,590
Did you say somethin'?

460
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,750
The child... did he have the girl with him?

461
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,270
- Uh-huh. - Seems to me if we launch now,

462
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,390
we can cut him down just about here.

463
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,630
- If he doesn't change course. - Ah, it's not likely.

464
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:15,350
He's a wily one, that ichthy-demon.

465
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,910
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,

466
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,790
he'll expect us to expect him to change course,

467
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:25,510
which is exactly why he'll keep his heading.

468
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,750
The important question is, where's he heading?

469
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:32,430
And does he know how precious his cargo is?

470
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,790
I say that he's headed here, and we take him here.

471
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,910
- Drifter? - Mm-hmm.

472
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,910
Are we gonna stop?

473
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,910
- Look at the flag! - His flag's up.

474
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,070
I thought you all stopped for each other.

475
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,030
Well... maybe he has some food!

476
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,310
Don't find many who follow the rules anymore.

477
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:13,030
Well, make it quick. What's your business?

478
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,030
Trade.

479
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,950
You got any resin?

480
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:30,670
Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind. He's out of his mind. I don't have any resin.

481
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,150
You been outwater a long time, haven't you?

482
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,510
Must be jokin' me, man. Resin! You don't got enough.

483
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,750
How 'bout food?

484
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,790
Could you say that again, please?

485
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,830
- How 'bout food? - Ah, yeah, food.

486
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,470
Yeah, that'd be good, eh?

487
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,550
I haven't eaten in, well, you know, forever.

488
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,110
Which one of you two is a cook?

489
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,910
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress.

490
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,990
Like you said, I don't have much.

491
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,390
Now listen, eh? Let's see. What do I have to do?

492
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,150
We can start with that wee orchard you got over there.

493
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:12,110
All right, hold it there.

494
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,710
- We can talk. - Fair enough.

495
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,990
It's a nice rod, isn't it?

496
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,030
I like that rod. It's a nice rod.

497
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,190
Got yourself a wee harem goin' here now, do ya?

498
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,910
What you want for the women?

499
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:46,510
We're not for sale.

500
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,150
Not for sale? There's no such thing as not for sale.

501
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,590
"Not for sale"! Not for sale, eh?

502
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,030
- Are they a pair or would you consider sellin' 'em separate? - No.

503
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:01,030
Our business is done here unless you got some resin for sale you can part with.

504
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,530
I told you once already, I don't have it.

505
01:02:03,565 --> 01:02:05,950
I- I-I don't have it. Don't have it. Don't have it.

506
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:10,110
Haven't seen neither for trade in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

507
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,750
I do have somethin' that'll make you change your mind.

508
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:20,630
Somethin' that you can't pass on.

509
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:24,990
I took it off an Atoller refugee camp.

510
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,990
The life savings of the entire clan.

511
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,950
Paper.

512
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:43,590
It's paper. Have you ever seen paper? Look at it.

513
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,590
Smell it.

514
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,470
I been savin' it for a special trade.

515
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,110
Don't you do it.

516
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,070
You know, maybe I'm talkin' to the wrong person here.

517
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,270
Whose boat is this? Is it your boat or your boat?

518
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,990
No. No, it's his boat. But he doesn't own us.

519
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,030
Half an hour.

520
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,710
Out of his mind somethin' there.

521
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:20,750
I got two pages in here, man! I mean, I'd get half a dozen girls with this, you know.

522
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,550
Half an hour.

523
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,710
- You tradin' or not? - Don't.

524
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,750
Shut up.

525
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:31,310
Okay.

526
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,230
Forty-five minutes with the wee one right there.

527
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,790
I like to do the talkin', if you know what I mean.

528
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,510
No!

529
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,630
Fair. Come, come, come, come, come!

530
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,990
No. My boat.

531
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,270
- Fair enough. Fair enough. Good, good, good. Aye. - Helen.

532
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,950
- Sit down. - Enola, just do as he says.

533
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,190
It's been a while for me now.

534
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:49,910
Guess it's been more than a while, actually.

535
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,990
I've only got half an hour.Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour...

536
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,030
Great, great, great...

537
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:05,910
Ooh! You're so beautiful. Aye! Anyone ever told you that?

538
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,910
Give me that. What are you doin'? It's just a game.

539
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,230
Oh, I, um... I, uh... We was just playin'.

540
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:20,350
The trade's off.

541
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,310
I changed my mind.

542
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:26,350
Well, um... Well, you can't do that.

543
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,990
I mean, a deal's a deal, eh?

544
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,910
I just did.

545
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:33,110
Hey!

546
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:37,790
She's mine. Aye. No. No, no I own her. But... No.

547
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,790
- Go on. - Get, get, get. Go, go, go. Good, good.

548
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:45,190
But don't go too far now. This won't take but a minute.

549
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:55,750
I hate this boat. I hate this boat!

550
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:58,390
You bastard.

551
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:07,670
You... You're pretty stingy for a man who's got everything, aren't ya now?

552
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,350
Ah, you bastard!

553
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:39,910
Where's me boat?

554
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,190
Where's me boat?

555
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,430
Help me to me boat.

556
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:57,150
Ow! Me boat.

557
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,030
Me boat.

558
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,950
What the... No!

559
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,510
Never catch anything with this. It's useless.

560
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,990
Look, I'm sorry. You were right about the pole.

561
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,830
You were right, but we have to eat.

562
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,390
Now I know you can hear me!

563
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,990
Now we can fish for ourselves. You show us what to do.

564
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:03,310
You must know how. Even you gotta eat!

565
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,870
You just sit there.

566
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,310
- What... - I don't know.

567
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:10,150
Happy now?

568
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,190
You don't like my singing, do you?

569
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:37,150
Helen says you don't like my singing 'cause you can't sing.

570
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:45,990
- Ever try and listen? - To what?

571
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,270
The sound of the world.

572
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:58,350
- I don't hear anything. - That's because you're too loud,

573
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,390
and you're movin' around all the time.

574
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,230
Try sittin' still.

575
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,310
Eyeball?

576
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,630
I wish I had feet like his.

577
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,670
Then maybe I could swim.

578
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,430
Enola.

579
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,230
Sorry.

580
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,390
Never met a person couldn't swim before.

581
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:48,070
I can't.

582
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,550
People say I was weird.

583
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,550
Maybe they were right.

584
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,510
Maybe they were right about you too.

585
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,350
Enola wanted to give you this.

586
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:36,310
And this.

587
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,510
She won't take it again.

588
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,790
You don't look much like her.

589
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:51,376
Well, I'm not her mother,

590
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:52,722
if that's what you're asking.

591
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:54,070
You act like it.

592
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,070
What are those marks on her back?

593
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,630
Nothing. They're just fanciful things.

594
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,190
- Like what she draws? - She draws what she sees.

595
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,110
She's like a mirror.

596
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,230
People on the atoll thought she was a...

597
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,630
Freak?

598
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:20,190
Uh-huh. Yeah.

599
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,230
I just thought she was special.

600
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:33,670
I'm not givin' it to her. It's just...

601
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,510
A loan.

602
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:38,550
Yeah. I'm not givin' it to her.

603
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:47,550
Is Dryland beautiful?

604
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:51,510
You'll see.

605
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,670
Enola?

606
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,710
Enola, what are you doing?

607
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:25,310
- Those monsters'll kill her! - No, they're asleep now.

608
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:30,430
Hands around my neck.

609
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:35,910
Let the water tell your arms and legs how to move.

610
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:37,190
We're goin' down. Hold your breath.

611
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:19,630
- What is it? - What is it?

612
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,750
Barter outpost.

613
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,830
You said we'd get to Dryland today.

614
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:28,950
Today. Tomorrow. What's it matter?

615
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,630
I need resin.

616
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:47,670
- What is that? - It's PortuGreek. Their own language.

617
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,910
Or so I thought.

618
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:21,630
Ah.

619
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:25,030
- There's my girl. - Yeah.

620
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,750
Howdy, darlin'. Come on in here now.

621
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:00,670
- What's going on? - Smokers.

622
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,990
What the hell?

623
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:12,550
He's spotted us. Sound it!

624
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:16,510
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!

625
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:30,030
Yahoo!

626
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:40,910
Enola!

627
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:54,550
Starboard side! Now!

628
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:57,550
Get in the chair!

629
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:06,710
Watch it. He's clearin' the net.

630
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,190
Go to the helm.

631
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,510
- Get the centerboard! - Centerboard?

632
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:27,190
What centerboard? I don't know what to do!

633
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,950
It's too late. Over here!

634
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,550
No!

635
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:14,670
Gimme that rifle. Boy, if you wanna do somethin' right,

636
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,470
you've got to do it yourself.

637
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:19,510
All right.

638
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:27,910
- I winged him. - I say we load...

639
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:31,110
all the go-juice onto one boat and run the freak down.

640
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:34,590
You can't catch him in ten boats, and you wanna send just one?

641
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:37,150
Well, I pray that you're jokin'.

642
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,710
Bring me the trackers.

643
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:55,910
He's hurt.

644
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:58,270
It's not what you think. They weren't after her.

645
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,030
- I saw what I saw. - What?

646
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,270
No more lies.

647
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:12,030
What are the marks on her back?

648
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:14,790
People say it's the way to Dryland.

649
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:17,550
Dryland's a myth!

650
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:20,590
No! You said so yourself that you know where it is.

651
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,630
You did.

652
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:29,950
You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen before.

653
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:32,290
I've seen it. I've touched it! 

654
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,550
Dirt that was richer and darker than yours.

655
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,550
It was in the basket we found Enola in!

656
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:39,110
- It doesn't exist! - Well, how can you be so sure?

657
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:43,950
Because I've sailed farther than most have dreamed, and I've never seen it.

658
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:48,750
But the things on your boat!

659
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:51,110
"Things on my boat" what?

660
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:54,710
There are things on your boat that nobody has ever seen!

661
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,910
What are these shells?

662
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:00,070
And that reflecting glass?

663
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:04,630
And th-the music box? That...

664
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:08,270
Well, if not from Dryland, then where? Wh-Where?

665
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:13,110
You wanna see Dryland?

666
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,830
You really wanna see it?

667
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,590
I'll take you to Dryland.

668
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:29,870
Get in.

669
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,910
- Well, what about Enola? - There's only air for one.

670
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:41,270
- Get in the water. - It'll be all right.

671
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,990
Don't touch anything.

672
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:55,790
Okay?

673
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,830
I didn't know.

674
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,510
All this time...

675
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,550
I didn't know.

676
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,550
Nobody does.

677
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:47,590
Can you get us outta here?

678
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:51,190
I'd say there're two chances o' that.

679
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,630
- Hey! - No way and no how.

680
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:57,430
Shoulda bought me that drink. Come on!

681
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,350
This way. Come on!

682
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:08,350
Proper introductions first.

683
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,990
I'm the Deacon.

684
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:18,670
If you don't recall the face, perhaps it's

685
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,030
'cause I didn't always look like this.

686
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:27,670
Now, ahem, I suspect she's somewhere real close.

687
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:30,790
So we can tear this boat apart lookin' for her,

688
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:33,670
but I'd rather somebody tell me where she is.

689
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,550
And the first one that does that, lives.

690
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:41,110
And the runner-up... Well, actually, there are no runners-up.

691
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:46,310
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.

692
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:49,270
Choose 'em. One, two. Live or die.

693
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:53,990
You know, personally,

694
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:57,030
I'd rather shoot the sperm-of-the-devil here.

695
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:00,230
Huh? But you know somethin'?

696
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:02,710
I don't think you're gonna tell me, are ya?

697
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,710
Huh? Too bad.

698
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:09,430
Come on, eh? What do you say?

699
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:11,430
She's not your kind.

700
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:15,390
You don't even have a kind.

701
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:19,550
If you say it, he'll still kill us both.

702
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,990
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

703
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,950
If you don't tell me,

704
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:32,470
I swear to Poseidon I will torch your boat.

705
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:42,510
Refresh my memory. What happens when neither of 'em talks?

706
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,470
- Never happened before. - Never happened before.

707
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:48,230
All right!

708
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:53,350
If they won't tell us where she is, do 'em! Both of 'em! Kill 'em now!

709
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:56,350
- No! - No!

710
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,350
So gullible! Bring her here.

711
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:03,590
Take and ye shall receive! - No! Leave her!

712
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:06,390
So ends your daily sermonette!

713
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:10,310
All we gotta do is figure out this map. Turn her upside down.

714
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:13,670
- Does that mean anything to you? - No.

715
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:17,310
We'll figure it out back at the 'Deez. Back at the 'Deez, boys.

716
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,670
Careful with her. Careful with her!

717
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,630
- What about them? - Do 'em both.

718
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,350
Torch the boat.

719
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,670
We have to go under!

720
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:34,670
No, I can't breath like you!

721
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,670
I'll breathe for both of us.

722
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,310
Helen!

723
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:12,790
Helen, help! Helen! Helen!

724
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,070
My boat.

725
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:57,390
Enola.

726
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,550
What is this? Get those chains off her.

727
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,590
What are we, barbarians here?

728
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,150
Goodness gracious. Sakes alive.

729
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,590
Come on. Outta here, you big, nasty animal, you!

730
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,630
Well rub-a-dub-dub.

731
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:19,910
You wanna come over here and sit on my lap?

732
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:22,710
No? Ahem.

733
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:25,790
How 'bout a cigarette?

734
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:29,390
Nothin' like a good smoke if you miss your mom.

735
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:31,390
Never too young to start.

736
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,390
No. Well, I got somethin' right here I know you'd like.

737
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:40,630
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

738
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:46,790
Huh? Now they're yours...

739
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,230
if you help me with just one problem, all right?

740
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:57,750
Now, ahem... Now that tattoo on your back... Ahem.

741
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:03,910
I've been told that, uh... that's actually a map?

742
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,550
It's the way to Dryland.

743
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:11,550
Now we're gettin' someplace.

744
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,190
Could you teach me how to read that?

745
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,870
Setback.

746
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:27,310
Well, have you ever heard any of your friends talk about it?

747
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:32,470
You know, like your mommy or your pet fish? Did he say anything?

748
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:34,910
You shouldn't make fun of him. He wouldn't like it.

749
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:40,510
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like. He took out my eye.

750
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:46,470
And if I ever see him again, I'm gonna cut open his head and eat his brains!

751
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,750
You think he'd like that?

752
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:52,630
Can't kill him. He's even meaner than you are.

753
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:55,750
But he's not here.

754
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:57,750
And he ain't comin'.

755
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:59,710
And no one's gonna save you.

756
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,990
He'll come for me. He will.

757
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:07,270
Then you better tell me what I wanna know

758
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:09,470
or he can see what's left of you in a goddamn jar.

759
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,030
We're going to die here, aren't we?

760
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,910
Aren't we?

761
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:55,990
After the atoll,

762
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,790
when I offered myself to you,

763
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,830
why didn't you take me?

764
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,670
'Cause you didn't really want me.

765
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,630
Not really.

766
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:10,750
Have I been asleep long?

767
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,470
I was dreaming.

768
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,870
It's funny.

769
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:26,710
I always thought Dryland floated.

770
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:28,430
That it drifted with the wind.

771
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:30,110
That's why it was so hard to find.

772
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:32,550
Why did you believe in it so much?

773
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:36,430
Because we weren't made for the sea.

774
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:40,910
Got hands... and feet.

775
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:43,670
We're supposed to walk.

776
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,630
I miss her sound.

777
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:53,070
Don't you?

778
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:58,510
Helen!

779
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,710
He... No, no, no. Helen, up here. Above you!

780
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:04,230
Gregor!

781
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:11,510
Smart thinking to burn your boat.

782
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:15,190
Without the smoke, I never would have found you.

783
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,270
Who's that with you?

784
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:21,070
Ichthyus Sapien, is that really you?

785
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:25,110
I'll throw the rope down. You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

786
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:30,870
Helen. Where's Enola?

787
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:36,310
Smokers took her. They'd have me too if it weren't for him.

788
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:40,670
My friend, thank you. Very human of you.

789
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,190
Go grab your things quickly. Quickly. Come.

790
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:55,110
You see? Right down there.

791
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,190
There's several of us survivors. We'll just start over again.

792
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,190
You can't ask us to go get her!

793
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,630
Enola's the reason we're in all this trouble.

794
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:09,310
They don't have any reason to kill her. They need to find Dryland just like we do.

795
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:13,310
- Of course. - If the Mariner's willing to go, why not us?

796
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:15,630
If he wants to go, then let him!

797
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:18,910
We don't want you here! You or the girl!

798
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:23,350
Helen. The papers the Mariner brought you...

799
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:28,070
It's the same language the tattoo is written in. They're numbers.

800
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:31,550
- Gregor, you're as crazy as she is! - We can't stay here!

801
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:32,790
We're wasting valuable time.

802
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:33,950
More Smokers will come.

803
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,110
We need to be moving now!

804
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:39,630
My friends, don't you see we need this child if we want to find Dryland?

805
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,675
- I'm not goin'. - Nobody is.

806
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:44,070
We've seen their smoke on the horizon!

807
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,910
- Know what that is yet? - The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

808
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:52,590
It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location: Latitude, longitude.

809
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:57,390
It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something.

810
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:59,710
- It's upside down. - The world?

811
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,310
The poles have reversed themselves?

812
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:04,750
I've been mappin' the cities below.

813
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,910
The world wasn't created in a deluge. It was covered by it.

814
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:14,190
- That's blasphemy! - No, it's true.

815
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:18,990
I've seen it with my own eyes. There is land. It's right under our keel.

816
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:21,110
- None of it's dry anymore. - Some is.

817
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:27,190
Enola's been there. I know that now. I saw what she drew.

818
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:31,110
So that's why he's going after Enola... to find Dryland.

819
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:33,910
I don't care about Dryland.

820
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,830
This is ridiculous. Going after the Smokers?

821
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:39,110
He doesn't even know which direction they came from.

822
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:44,070
- I say let him go. - We're better off without them anyway!

823
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:47,910
If she's alive, I'll bring her back to you.

824
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:52,430
Forget the mute-o, Helen. If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

825
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:56,230
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him. I can't ask him to do this alone.

826
01:38:56,310 --> 01:39:00,310
Oh, don't worry, my dear. You're not going to have to.

827
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:09,190
You got that tattoo figured out yet?

828
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:11,910
It would be easier if it was flat... big and flat.

829
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:14,870
- It needs to be flat. - What you got in mind?

830
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:19,190
Well, you cut it off her back. You stretch it, mount it.

831
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:22,950
- Give us a proper look. - Take her down below until I holler.

832
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:25,230
Saint Joe, we're close.

833
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:29,910
After centuries of shame.

834
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:03,950
- They're gettin' ugly. - Don't I know it.

835
01:41:04,812 --> 01:41:06,812
Announce me, cousin.

836
01:41:10,932 --> 01:41:12,972
Hey. Here he is.

837
01:41:13,012 --> 01:41:14,972
Deacon!

838
01:41:15,052 --> 01:41:17,652
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

839
01:41:19,212 --> 01:41:22,732
Turn your eyes and open your hearts...

840
01:41:22,812 --> 01:41:25,172
to your humble benefactor,

841
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:29,092
your spiritual shepherd and dictator for life,

842
01:41:29,172 --> 01:41:32,172
the Deacon of the 'Deez.

843
01:41:53,812 --> 01:41:56,892
- Look out! - It's mine! It's mine!

844
01:42:03,612 --> 01:42:06,892
- Deacon! - Wahoo!

845
01:42:06,972 --> 01:42:12,772
Children. Children of the provider.

846
01:42:12,852 --> 01:42:16,732
Citizens of the good ship. Please now, hear me speak.

847
01:42:20,772 --> 01:42:23,812
- I've had a vision. - Yeah, we're tired of your visions!

848
01:42:23,892 --> 01:42:26,172
What about the land you promised us?

849
01:42:26,252 --> 01:42:29,052
Yeah! Yeah!

850
01:42:29,132 --> 01:42:31,252
Oh ye of little faith.

851
01:42:31,332 --> 01:42:33,732
I've had a vision so great...

852
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:37,132
that as it came to me, I wept.

853
01:42:37,172 --> 01:42:41,252
- And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder, - Is that Bone's ride?

854
01:42:41,332 --> 01:42:43,412
- Is that blood on the seat? - I saw...

855
01:42:43,652 --> 01:42:47,372
And you know what it is that I saw.

856
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:51,332
I saw... the land.

857
01:43:24,452 --> 01:43:26,732
Horse, that you?

858
01:43:31,332 --> 01:43:34,412
Look, just bring it in slow, okay? I don't have all day.

859
01:43:34,492 --> 01:43:37,972
Horse!

860
01:43:38,052 --> 01:43:40,452
Just bring it up slow.

861
01:43:41,492 --> 01:43:44,452
I said slow!

862
01:43:49,092 --> 01:43:53,252
Shouldn't be doing that. You're gonna get in trouble.

863
01:43:53,332 --> 01:43:55,492
Ha. That's right.

864
01:43:55,732 --> 01:43:59,772
You're not afraid. You've got your pet freak comin' to rescue you.

865
01:43:59,852 --> 01:44:04,332
He's not a freak, and he can take you anytime.

866
01:44:04,372 --> 01:44:08,452
He's killed dozens of people, and he doesn't have any mercy or anything.

867
01:44:08,532 --> 01:44:10,812
He even kills little girls.

868
01:44:12,532 --> 01:44:14,172
Haven't we all?

869
01:44:16,252 --> 01:44:18,212
Shit.

870
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:20,452
It's Horse.

871
01:44:21,892 --> 01:44:24,332
- Find him. Find him! - Come on!

872
01:44:24,412 --> 01:44:28,812
Yes! Yes! Yes!

873
01:44:28,892 --> 01:44:32,412
- Come on. - Gettin' nervous, aren't you?

874
01:44:36,852 --> 01:44:38,772
I don't get nervous.

875
01:44:40,052 --> 01:44:42,492
And if there's a river, we'll dam it.

876
01:44:42,572 --> 01:44:47,092
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it.

877
01:44:47,172 --> 01:44:50,252
'Cause I'm talkin' progress here.

878
01:44:50,332 --> 01:44:53,372
Yes, sir. I'm talkin' development.

879
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:57,452
- Yeah! - For we shall suck and savor...

880
01:44:57,492 --> 01:45:02,052
the sweet flavor of Dryland.

881
01:45:02,092 --> 01:45:03,972
Face is all red.

882
01:45:04,052 --> 01:45:09,132
Helen said with anybody that has a face that red,

883
01:45:09,172 --> 01:45:11,332
he's had too much sun or too much to drink.

884
01:45:11,412 --> 01:45:14,432
All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn your face.

885
01:45:14,432 --> 01:45:15,452
Almost time.

886
01:45:15,532 --> 01:45:19,572
- What's up? - We're just talkin' about our friend.

887
01:45:22,052 --> 01:45:24,932
- What's his name? - He doesn't have a name.

888
01:45:25,012 --> 01:45:27,492
So death can't find him.

889
01:45:32,932 --> 01:45:36,852
Doesn't have a home or people to care for.

890
01:45:36,932 --> 01:45:39,852
He's not afraid of anything, men least of all.

891
01:45:39,932 --> 01:45:43,412
He's fast and strong like a big wind.

892
01:45:43,492 --> 01:45:46,852
He can hear a hundred miles and see a hundred miles underwater.

893
01:45:46,932 --> 01:45:50,972
He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun.

894
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:54,932
He could be right behind you, and you won't even know it 'til you're dead!

895
01:45:57,412 --> 01:45:59,412
Give it a rest.

896
01:46:00,852 --> 01:46:02,852
He'll come for me. He will.

897
01:46:02,892 --> 01:46:05,412
- We are the people... - Yeah?

898
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:09,012
- Well, I hope he does. - The Lord's creation.

899
01:46:10,252 --> 01:46:12,172
Remember you said that.

900
01:46:13,332 --> 01:46:16,132
Look at us.

901
01:46:16,172 --> 01:46:18,852
- Look at us here today. - Yeah!

902
01:46:18,932 --> 01:46:22,452
Dryland is not just our destination,

903
01:46:22,492 --> 01:46:24,572
but it is our destiny!

904
01:46:34,092 --> 01:46:36,492
Find him. Find him!

905
01:46:36,532 --> 01:46:38,652
How can I find...

906
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,012
this glorious place?

907
01:46:42,052 --> 01:46:44,892
And he said to me:

908
01:46:44,932 --> 01:46:48,892
"A child shall lead you."

909
01:46:50,332 --> 01:46:52,412
A child.

910
01:46:52,492 --> 01:46:54,892
- And behold! - It's time.

911
01:46:54,972 --> 01:46:58,012
The instrument of our salvation!

912
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:07,972
Our guide in the wild.

913
01:47:08,052 --> 01:47:10,372
Our beacon in the darkness.

914
01:47:10,412 --> 01:47:12,372
Turn her around, Nord.

915
01:47:12,412 --> 01:47:15,252
She has shown me the path!

916
01:47:19,652 --> 01:47:23,172
And before the holy-most moment is upon us,

917
01:47:23,252 --> 01:47:26,652
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe.

918
01:47:29,972 --> 01:47:33,452
And let's get this tub of shit up to speed.

919
01:47:39,532 --> 01:47:41,492
Yep.

920
01:48:19,532 --> 01:48:21,452
Pull!

921
01:48:21,532 --> 01:48:24,252
- Pull! - Pull!

922
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:26,412
- Pull. - Pull!

923
01:48:41,012 --> 01:48:42,812
Ow.

924
01:48:46,412 --> 01:48:49,652
- So which way we rowin'? - I don't have a goddamn clue.

925
01:48:49,692 --> 01:48:51,652
Don't worry.

926
01:48:51,732 --> 01:48:54,692
They'll row for a month before they figure out I'm fakin' it.

927
01:48:54,732 --> 01:48:57,492
But, um, wh-wh...

928
01:48:57,532 --> 01:49:00,652
Oh, you want details. Well, I'm not tellin' these savages...

929
01:49:00,692 --> 01:49:03,012
that we haven't solved the map yet.

930
01:49:03,092 --> 01:49:08,452
I promised them results, and I'll get 'em if I gotta cut 'em out of her goddamn back.

931
01:49:09,772 --> 01:49:13,212
Who is that? Who is that?

932
01:49:14,332 --> 01:49:16,732
Maybe one of the spare rowers?

933
01:49:24,652 --> 01:49:27,412
Why aren't you rowin'?

934
01:49:36,092 --> 01:49:38,132
- It's him. - It is him.

935
01:49:39,492 --> 01:49:42,212
You guys are in so much trouble.

936
01:49:45,092 --> 01:49:49,412
Well, I'll be damned. It's the gentleman guppy.

937
01:49:49,452 --> 01:49:53,252
You know, he's like a turd that won't flush.

938
01:49:53,332 --> 01:49:56,052
I want the girl.

939
01:49:58,412 --> 01:50:03,532
You know, I thought you were stupid, friend.

940
01:50:03,612 --> 01:50:06,532
But I underestimated you.

941
01:50:06,612 --> 01:50:09,612
You're a total freakin' retard.

942
01:50:12,812 --> 01:50:16,172
I want the girl. That's all.

943
01:50:16,212 --> 01:50:20,892
Well, what on this screwed-up Earth makes you think you're gonna get her?

944
01:50:29,292 --> 01:50:31,252
You know what this is?

945
01:50:35,532 --> 01:50:38,092
I drop it, you burn.

946
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:41,932
- We all burn. - Now wait, wait, wait, wait.

947
01:50:42,172 --> 01:50:45,812
Ahem. Let's not do anything rash here.

948
01:50:45,892 --> 01:50:49,212
I mean, uh, are you sure she's worth all this?

949
01:50:49,292 --> 01:50:52,412
She never does stop talkin'. She never shuts up.

950
01:50:52,492 --> 01:50:54,772
- I noticed. - What is it then?

951
01:50:54,852 --> 01:50:57,252
Huh? It's the map.

952
01:50:58,692 --> 01:51:01,452
She's my friend.

953
01:51:01,532 --> 01:51:04,332
Golly gee. A single tear rolls down my cheek.

954
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:07,332
I mean, you're gonna die for your friend.

955
01:51:08,732 --> 01:51:10,652
If it comes to that.

956
01:51:12,892 --> 01:51:15,152
He's bluffing. I'll kill him.

957
01:51:15,152 --> 01:51:17,412
He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.

958
01:51:17,492 --> 01:51:18,652
Shut up!

959
01:51:19,932 --> 01:51:25,212
I don't... l-l... I don't think you're gonna drop that torch, my friend.

960
01:51:25,292 --> 01:51:28,852
- Why not? - Because you're not crazy.

961
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:35,292
No!

962
01:51:42,252 --> 01:51:44,852
Oh, thank God.

963
01:52:01,812 --> 01:52:04,212
Look out!

964
01:52:04,252 --> 01:52:06,692
Get him!

965
01:52:06,732 --> 01:52:10,332
Let's go, goddamn it!

966
01:52:10,412 --> 01:52:15,012
Don't just stand there! Kill somethin'!

967
01:52:18,332 --> 01:52:20,292
Was this your big vision?

968
01:52:28,852 --> 01:52:32,812
Oh, yeah! I've always wanted to drive this monster.

969
01:52:36,052 --> 01:52:39,372
There he is! There he is!

970
01:52:42,452 --> 01:52:44,732
That's him! There!

971
01:52:57,652 --> 01:53:01,332
No! Let go!

972
01:53:10,892 --> 01:53:13,412
Let go!

973
01:53:16,732 --> 01:53:19,372
- Let me go! Let go! - Pilot!

974
01:53:19,452 --> 01:53:21,812
- Pilot! - Let me go!

975
01:53:21,892 --> 01:53:23,812
Let go!

976
01:53:23,892 --> 01:53:25,852
Let go-o-o-o!

977
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:31,012
You should've stayed underwater.

978
01:53:40,852 --> 01:53:45,292
Now you know how to fly an airplane? You're lucky I do.

979
01:53:45,332 --> 01:53:48,332
Ow! Now you stop it! You behave yourself now!

980
01:55:20,772 --> 01:55:22,692
It's going down.

981
01:55:22,772 --> 01:55:27,892
- You can see it sinking. - Gregor, bring us right down on top of it.

982
01:55:27,972 --> 01:55:30,092
- Hurry, Gregor! - Don't worry.

983
01:55:30,172 --> 01:55:32,092
Hurry.

984
01:55:43,932 --> 01:55:47,052
Enola! Up here!

985
01:55:47,132 --> 01:55:49,092
Grab on!

986
01:55:54,172 --> 01:55:56,132
Are they on yet?

987
01:55:59,652 --> 01:56:02,452
- What is it? - I don't know!

988
01:56:02,492 --> 01:56:04,172
No!

989
01:56:13,572 --> 01:56:18,932
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip your cute little lungs out.

990
01:56:33,172 --> 01:56:35,772
Pull! Almost.

991
01:57:14,812 --> 01:57:16,572
No!

992
01:57:16,652 --> 01:57:19,572
No! Enola!

993
01:57:20,932 --> 01:57:23,252
Saint Joe. Hole in one.

994
01:57:23,332 --> 01:57:27,172
- Helen! - No! Enola! - Helen!

995
01:57:27,212 --> 01:57:29,932
Hey! Hey!

996
01:57:36,572 --> 01:57:40,612
Ohh. Oh, no! Quick! What are we gonna do?

997
01:57:43,892 --> 01:57:46,332
Tie this off.

998
01:57:49,852 --> 01:57:52,692
- Hurry! - Tie it!

999
01:57:57,172 --> 01:57:59,772
- Got it! - Ah!

1000
01:58:12,652 --> 01:58:15,092
Get 'em up now.

1001
01:58:25,172 --> 01:58:28,692
- Of course! North is south. - What?

1002
01:58:28,772 --> 01:58:32,092
- South is north. - I was swimming.

1003
01:58:32,132 --> 01:58:34,332
- I saw. - My friends.

1004
01:58:34,412 --> 01:58:36,612
My friends, look.

1005
01:58:36,692 --> 01:58:39,052
If I take a bearing from the sun

1006
01:58:39,052 --> 01:58:41,412
and reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,

1007
01:58:43,612 --> 01:58:46,772
then Dryland is that way!

1008
02:00:48,132 --> 02:00:51,132
It's fresh!

1009
02:00:51,212 --> 02:00:53,892
All of this! It's fresh!

1010
02:01:01,092 --> 02:01:03,052
No!

1011
02:01:07,492 --> 02:01:09,932
Whoo! Whoo!

1012
02:01:10,012 --> 02:01:12,292
I found something!

1013
02:01:25,012 --> 02:01:28,492
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.

1014
02:01:28,572 --> 02:01:30,492
I think it was their way.

1015
02:01:32,892 --> 02:01:34,892
They must have known they were dying.

1016
02:02:05,412 --> 02:02:07,332
I'm home.

1017
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:20,892
- Where's the Mariner? - He was outside.

1018
02:02:26,212 --> 02:02:28,892
Wait. Wait! I want to show you this.

1019
02:03:41,332 --> 02:03:44,052
First time in your life you got nothin' to say?

1020
02:03:58,932 --> 02:04:01,372
Enola, I have to go now.

1021
02:04:01,452 --> 02:04:03,412
But you came back for me.

1022
02:04:05,492 --> 02:04:07,452
I like you.

1023
02:04:12,572 --> 02:04:14,532
Why are you leaving?

1024
02:04:17,372 --> 02:04:21,092
- I don't belong here. I belong out there. - You belong here.

1025
02:04:24,372 --> 02:04:27,292
It's too strange here. It doesn't move right.

1026
02:04:27,332 --> 02:04:30,172
Helen said that it's only land sickness.

1027
02:04:31,372 --> 02:04:34,972
We're all feeling it. It'll go away soon.

1028
02:04:35,052 --> 02:04:36,972
It's more than that.
