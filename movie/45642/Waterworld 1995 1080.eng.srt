What you got?

00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,990
Couple of heartbeats over there.
Aren't saying much.

lf you'll notice the arterial
nature of the blood

328
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:33,604
coming from the hole in my head,

329
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,875
you can assume that we're
all having a real lousy day.

So here it is, l need to know
about that tattooed girl.

-l saw a girl. l saw... lt was...
-She had a big tattoo on her.

l saw a girl.

335
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,024
l'm not sure, but l think she got on
that boat with three hulls.

The boat that cost me
1,000 G's of go-juice?

Yeah, the mute-o's boat.

-Mute-o?
-Yeah. He got these slits here.

He wasn't really a man.

341
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,626
A fluke of evolution.

-Witnesses, anybody, did l?
-Yes, yes, yes! You said...
