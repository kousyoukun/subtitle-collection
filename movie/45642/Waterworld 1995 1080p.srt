How many G's

On your toes.

659

Why don't you
use sea hydro?

660
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:56,233
SaIt's harder
on the fiIters.

661
01:05:18,828 --> 01:05:20,489
Can we have some?

662
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,731
It's for her, not me.

663
01:05:36,913 --> 01:05:38,437
Here, come on.

664
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:42,274
Is he going to take

01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:44,635
Where did you get this?
From down beIow.

678
01:07:44,707 --> 01:07:47,733
This is mine!
You don't touch
anything of mine.

679
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:48,970
I drew it for you.

680
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:51,536
You don't draw on anything.
You understand?

681
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:03,917
This is my boat.
I got it the way I Iike it.

682
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:07,189
You take up space

She doesn't know
your ruIes.

You wanna stay?

686

What happens when
neither of them taIks?

1107
01:54:15,595 --> 01:54:17,927
Never happened before.

Bring her here.

01:54:53,166 --> 01:54:54,463
Stunning.

I don't have words
to even begin to...

1123
01:54:57,671 --> 01:54:59,332
It's magnificent!

1124
01:54:59,606 --> 01:55:01,096

AII we gotta do is
figure out this map.
Turn her upside down.

Does that mean
anything to you?

What's happening, cousin?

1150
01:57:32,592 --> 01:57:35,652
Not a word. She just
sits there and Ieaks.

This'II make her give up
aII her secrets, huh?

Yeah, or kiII her.

you big, nasty animaI, you!

You wanna come over here
and sit on my Iap?

1160
01:58:09,329 --> 01:58:13,060
No. WeII, I got something
right here I know you'd Iike.

1161
01:58:14,567 --> 01:58:16,432
Like to draw, don't you?

1162
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:22,498
Now, they're yours,

one probIem, aII right?

Good parish. Large parish.

aII the time, in fact.

1167

Now, you know,
I just don't have
enough faith

1168
01:58:47,133 --> 01:58:48,566
for aII these peopIe.

1169

Why don't you
make Iess peopIe?

1170
01:58:51,204 --> 01:58:52,432

onIy when there's room.

That way, there's food
and hydro for everyone.

1173
01:59:01,347 --> 01:59:04,339
WeII, that's
a quaint suggestion.

1174
01:59:05,485 --> 01:59:07,749
But it don't
reaIIy pIay here,

1175
01:59:07,987 --> 01:59:12,083
considering we are, in fact,
the Church of EternaI Growth.

1176
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:18,859
See, what we need is
more Iand, for more peopIe.

1177
01:59:18,932 --> 01:59:22,527
Now, that tattoo
on your back.

1178
01:59:22,602 --> 01:59:27,505
I've been toId that
that's actuaIIy a map?

1179
01:59:30,043 --> 01:59:32,307
It's the way to DryIand.

1180
01:59:32,378 --> 01:59:34,209
Now we're getting somepIace.

1181
01:59:36,349 --> 01:59:39,546
CouId you teach me
how to read that?

1182
01:59:41,955 --> 01:59:43,149
Setback.

1183
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:47,754
WeII, have you ever
heard any of your
friends taIk about it?

1184
01:59:47,827 --> 01:59:51,456
You know, Iike your mommy
or your pet fish?

1185
01:59:51,531 --> 01:59:53,021
Did he say anything?

1186
01:59:53,099 --> 01:59:55,590
You shouIdn't make
fun of him.
He wouIdn't Iike it.

1187
01:59:55,668 --> 01:59:57,795
He took out my eye.

1188
01:59:57,871 --> 01:59:59,361
And if I ever see him again,

1189
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:03,808
I'm gonna cut open his head
and eat his brains!

1190
02:00:03,877 --> 02:00:06,107
You think he'd Iike that?

1191
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:10,047
Can't kiII him.
He's even meaner
than you are.

1192
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:13,114
But he's not here.

1193
02:00:13,186 --> 02:00:15,177
And he ain't coming.

1194
02:00:15,255 --> 02:00:17,382
And no one's gonna save you.

1195
02:00:18,591 --> 02:00:20,525
He'II come for me.
He wiII.

1196
02:00:20,593 --> 02:00:23,118
Then you better teII me
what I wanna know

1197
02:00:23,196 --> 02:00:26,688
or he can see what's
Ieft of you in a jar.

1198
02:00:29,869 --> 02:00:32,429
Now, I'm gIad
we had this IittIe taIk.

1199
02:00:33,673 --> 02:00:35,004
Chain her.

1200
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:39,000
Chain her up.

1201
02:00:40,113 --> 02:00:43,173
He'II come for me!
He'II take me away!

1202
02:00:55,028 --> 02:00:57,155
We're going to die here,
aren't we?

1203
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:18,512
Aren't we?

1204
02:01:28,461 --> 02:01:30,292
After the atoII,

1205
02:01:31,297 --> 02:01:33,390
when I offered myseIf to you,

1206
02:01:36,603 --> 02:01:38,366
why didn't you take me?

1207
02:01:40,873 --> 02:01:42,898
'Cause you didn't
reaIIy want me.

1208
02:01:45,078 --> 02:01:46,443
Not reaIIy.

1209
02:02:52,612 --> 02:02:54,307
Have I been
asIeep Iong?

1210
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:02,087
I was dreaming.

1211
02:03:05,258 --> 02:03:06,555
It's funny.

1212
02:03:08,227 --> 02:03:10,320
I aIways thought
DryIand fIoated.

1213
02:03:10,997 --> 02:03:14,865
That it drifted
with the wind. That's why
it was so hard to find.

1214
02:03:15,068 --> 02:03:17,332
Why did you beIieve
in it so much?

1215
02:03:18,638 --> 02:03:20,970
Because we weren't
made for the sea.

1216
02:03:22,508 --> 02:03:25,773
Got hands and feet.

1217
02:03:25,845 --> 02:03:27,574
We're supposed to waIk.

1218
02:03:31,517 --> 02:03:33,109
I miss her sound.

1219
02:03:35,788 --> 02:03:36,982
Don't you?

1220
02:03:37,924 --> 02:03:40,893
Might be abIe to get
some hydro out of this.

1221
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:42,584
I can't go on.

1222
02:03:44,497 --> 02:03:47,057
Not without her,
or DryIand.

1223
02:03:48,301 --> 02:03:51,327
I don't want to Iive
if there's nothing Ieft.

1224
02:03:52,171 --> 02:03:53,798
There's no hope.

1225
02:03:54,674 --> 02:03:56,369
You're stiII here.

1226
02:04:03,716 --> 02:04:05,650
Thank you for saving me.

1227
02:04:05,718 --> 02:04:07,845
You can thank the ancients.

1228
02:04:09,489 --> 02:04:11,389
This is what they had.

1229
02:04:12,325 --> 02:04:14,555
This is what
they made of it.

1230
02:04:15,194 --> 02:04:17,253
That's why
I am what I am.

1231
02:04:17,597 --> 02:04:20,225
I may not be human,
but I don't quit.

1232
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,199
Never have.

1233
02:04:23,136 --> 02:04:25,161
No matter what
they throw at me, I...

1234

Very human of you.
