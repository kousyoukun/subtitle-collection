00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,990
未來
The future

3
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,390
南北極冰水徹底融化
The polar ice caps have melted

4
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,190
地球被淹沒在海洋中
covering the Earth with water

5
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,750
倖存者逐漸建立一個新世界
Those who survived have adapted...

6
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,750
"水世界"
to a new world.

7
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:14,000
我沒上你船[印地語]

8
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,264
我不會幹那種事的

9
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,208
你下去了很長時間

10
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:20,370
我的船出了點問題

11
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:26,285
破了一個大洞 幸好還有地方讓我呼吸

12
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,030
夠倒霉的 說英語吧
Bad luck, English.

13
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,550
最近那些販奴商生產出了一種效果很好的氧化劑
But the Slavers are producing a good grade of poxy these days.

14
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,510
跟你換一把泥土 或是那個風鈴
Cost you a handful of dirt... or maybe that wind chime.

15
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,390
- 你來這媟F嘛? - 等你唄
- What are you doin' here? - Just waiting.

16
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,430
你的臭手別碰船帆
Take your hand off the sail.

17
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,070
手拿開
Take it off!

18
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,830
我之前見過你的船 卻沒見過你
I've seen your boat before. Haven't seen you.

19
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,670
是合法的先占
Took it legal.

20
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,710
我發現這船的時候船主已經死了
Previous owner was dead on the tiller when I found it.

21
00:05:57,745 --> 00:06:00,670
我高價轉賣之前你還有一個小時的時間考慮
You had another hour before I traded up again.

22
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,390
賺得更多是我的宗旨
Just improving my means.

23
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,270
- 好吧 算我欠你個人情 - 謝啦 不用了
- Well, I owe you then. - No, thanks.

24
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,510
我的裝備已經補足了 我才從一個環礁基地出來
I got all the supplies I need. Just came from an atoll.

25
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,550
你想去的話 向東航行八天
Eight days east, if you're interested.

26
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,430
- 海行者碰面通常都要交換 - 我知道規矩
- Two drifters meet, something needs to be exchanged. - I know the code.

27
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,150
但是這次我就免費給你
But I'll give you this one for free.

28
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,590
在這片汪洋中絕不會有免費午餐的
Nothing's free in Waterworld.

29
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,910
是啊
Ha-ha. Yeah.

30
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:30,150
是啊
Ha-ha. Yeah.

31
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,790
是掠海者
Smokers.

32
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,870
風勢正好助我順利開溜
Just enough wind to get away clean.

33
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,790
就別管那包東西了
Forget the bag.

34
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,710
那不值得你一搏 更何況你連帆都沒拉起來
It's not worth it. You'll never make it with your sails down.

35
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,350
Hey!

36
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,390
祝你好運啦
What can I say?

37
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,830
- 喬 他要開溜 - 搞什麼鬼?
- Joe, he's goin' for it. - What the hell?

38
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,910
真是大開眼界啊
Never seen that before.

39
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,990
快啟動 快啊 快踩油門
Here we go! Go! Drive! Drive!

40
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,270
快點 再快點
Faster! Faster! Whoo!

41
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,350
快點 要被他搶走了
Come on! He's gonna get it! He's gonna get it!

42
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,310
- 快逮他 - 上呀! 上呀!
- Pick her up! - Get it! Get it!

43
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,750
不 別
Oh, no!

44
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,910
有船接近 到門外了
Inbound! Straight out from the gates.

45
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:14,799
你講什麼話?

46
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,430
英文
English.

47
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,030
已經收市了 海行者 今天已經不再交易了
Flag's down, drifter. We got enough traders.

48
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,287
他拿的是什麼?

49
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,430
泥土
Dirt.

50
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,430
開門
Open the gates!

51
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,070
化骨為漿
Bones to berries.

52
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,390
抽脈為藤
Veins to vine.

53
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,630
肢骨化為大樹 血漿變鹽水
These tendons to trees. This blood to brine.

54
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,390
歲月奪走了她的生命
Too old she was.

55
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,210
但她卻恩澤予我們
This woman does leave us

56
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,870
我們在上帝面前收下她的恩澤並銘記她
ecycled and enshrined in the presence of Him who leads us.

57
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,510
那是什麼?
What is that?

58
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,470
你認識我嗎?
You know me?

59
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,470
我知道你是誰
I know what you are.

60
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,190
很好 那你自然知道在這兒鬧事
Good. Then you know if you look for trouble while you're here,

61
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,470
只會讓你吃不完兜著走
you'll find more than you can handle.

62
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,190
我給你兩個小時
You got two hours.

63
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,830
我只需要一小時
I'll only need one.

64
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,510
他走過來了
He's comin' over here.

65
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,870
- 給我 - 賞你們一人一個
- Me. - You each get one...

66
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,510
只要能在我回來前幫我看好船
if everything's here when I get back.

67
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,070
純泥土
Pure dirt.

68
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,630
3.2公斤
3.2 kilos.

69
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,830
你從哪兒找來這麼多泥土?
How'd you come by so much of it?

70
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,710
從這兒向西差不多30個海平線遠的另一個環礁基地那兒
Another atoll 30 horizons west of here.

71
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,870
那他們是在哪兒弄到的呢
Where'd they get it?

72
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,110
- 他們沒有透露 - 聽說那地方的人
- They didn't say. - We heard about that place...

73
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,790
全都被殺光了
that they was all killed.

74
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,790
- 那就是他們不透露的原因 - 掠海者干的?
- That's why they didn't say. - Smokers?

75
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,030
也許是掠海者 也有可能是販奴商
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.

76
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,230
怎麼樣?要交易嗎?
So what's the word? We tradin' or not?

77
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,110
我們就把它當成是 純淨水的價值交易
We'll tally it like, uh, pure hydro.

78
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,710
給你62塊錢
Works out to... 62 chits.

79
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,630
我要加倍
I want twice that.

80
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,350
- 我只想喝一點水罷了 - 不行 除非你告訴我
- I just want one sip of hydro! - No, not 'til you tell me.

81
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,790
她背上有圖案 我看過
She got inkings on her back. I seen her.

82
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,990
傳說只要你能解開那孩子身上圖案之謎
They say if you read the marks on the child,

83
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,590
那就能指引你到達陸地
they'll lead ya all the way to Dryland.

84
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,750
- 陸地只是神話 - 但還是有人相信
- Dryland's a myth. - Some still believe.

85
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,870
他們還說掠海者在找這小女孩
They say the Smokers even got an eye out for her.

86
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,670
是嗎 那麼 我們最好還是保密
Well, then, we'd better keep it to ourselves.

87
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,591
挺壯嘛

88
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,190
- 需要幫忙嗎 - 是的
- Help you? - Yeah.

89
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,670
- 商店在哪? - 就你眼前
- Where's the store? - You found it.

90
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,230
東西不多
You don't have much.

91
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,110
你就是帶著泥土的那個人?
You the man with the dirt?

92
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,190
乾杯
Skoal.

93
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,350
- 再來一杯 - 來兩杯
- One more. - Make it two.

94
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,230
一個這麼有錢的人會請陸上的朋友喝一杯的 我確定
A man this rich will buy for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

95
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,750
就一杯
One.

96
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,990
你腳上這雙鞋挺有趣的
That's an interesting pair of boots you got.

97
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,190
- 想交換嗎? - 不想
- Trade? - No.

98
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,350
真可惜
Shame.

99
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:46,770
就是她
That's her

100
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,070
埃諾拉 你在幹嘛?
Enola. Hey, what are you doing?

101
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,390
不行 你不能這樣
No, you can't do that.

102
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,670
我還需要一塊兒
I need another piece.

103
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,950
我想多畫點
I want to draw some more.

104
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,710
我會拿給你的 去後面呆著去
I'll get it to you. Just stay in the back.

105
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,870
用這筆錢 你能好好沖個澡
With all those chits, you could order up a bath.

106
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,210
你用淡水洗過澡嗎?
Have you ever had a freshwater bath?

107
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,470
你為什麼找我說話?
Why are you talkin' to me?

108
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,470
我只想交個朋友
Just being friendly.

109
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,150
- 那是蕃茄樹嗎? - 對
- Is that a tomato plant? - Yeah.

110
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,390
你很有眼光啊
You have a keen eye.

111
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,470
曾經在圖片上見過 怎麼賣的?
Saw one in a picture. How much?

112
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,790
你一半的錢
Half your chits.

113
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,310
- 那些我也要 - 還要什麼?
- I'll take them too. - Take what?

114
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,390
- 東西全被你買了 - 那些架子我也要
- You bought everything. - I'll take them shelves.

115
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,390
你在海上那15個月堻ㄗㄗ儦L什麼
So, what did you see out there in your 15 months?

116
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,030
- 比如呢? - 這片水域的盡頭
- Such as? - An end to all this water.

117
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,710
你問錯人了
Askin' the wrong person.

118
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,790
他們今天不是埋葬了一個人嗎?
The one they buried today?

119
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,270
她就是這兒的唯一盡頭
She found the only end there is.

120
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,350
航海人 我給你一個建議
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.

121
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,963
我不會留下來
I'm not staying. 

122
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,616
我們沒要你留下來
We're not asking you to.

123
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,270
我們要的是你的後裔
All we want is your seed.

124
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,470
找自己人雖然也行
We can look to our own for impregnation,

125
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,990
但是長此以往必會導致孩子的基因不良
but too much of that sort of thing gets... undesirable.

126
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,030
只要她懷了孕
When she's pregnant

127
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,790
你就可以帶上你所需的所有補給繼續你的行程
you go on your way with all the supplies you need.

128
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,830
別費神了 你們已經無藥可救了
You don't have anything. You're dying.

129
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,150
沒有人會在漂泊那麼久之後竟對女人無動於衷的
No man stays out that long and turns down a woman.

130
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,830
- 他一定在隱瞞什麼 - 說不定他是個掠海者間諜
- He's hiding something. - Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

131
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,350
只有長老讓你走 你才能走
When the elders say so, you can leave,

132
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,350
否則別想走
and not before.

133
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,430
有鰓
Gills.

134
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,510
- 變種人 - 他是變種人
- Mutation! - He's a mutant!

135
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,390
我的手
My hand!

136
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,070
快撒網
Throw the nets!

137
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,470
你憑什麼?
By what right...

138
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,910
憑你雇我來維持這堛滲揮
You pay me to keep the peace.

139
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,910
絕不是這樣的秩序
This isn't it.

140
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,310
- 他已經殺了我們一個人了 - 他只是自衛
- He has killed one of ours. - He was defending himself.

141
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,643
他必須被處決
He needs to be destroyed!

142
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:35,896
宰了他 我們得宰了他
Kill him. Let's kill him.

143
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:37,150
也許吧
That may be,

144
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,470
但絕不是在這兒更不是用這種方式
but not here and not like this.

145
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,470
那是什麼?
What is it?

146
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,470
該死的
Damn.

147
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,950
他們看得太緊了 我沒機會下手
It's tied. I can't get it off.

148
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,630
開門
Open the gate.

149
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,310
那是地圖嗎?
Is it a map?

150
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,110
如果你知道就告訴我 好嗎 埃諾拉?
You'd tell me if you knew, wouldn't you, Enola?

151
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,390
- 你在畫什麼? - 我不知道
- What are you drawing? - I don't know.

152
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,310
海倫 你看 看這小天才的最新幻想
Helen, look. Look at the prodigal child's latest vision.

153
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,610
我們什麼時候才能走? 
How soon before we can leave?

154
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,150
我還不知道幾時能走?
I don't have any idea yet where we can go.

155
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,510
我搞不懂她的刺青
I haven't figured out the tattoo on her back.

156
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,230
我真是個蠢蛋 答案看似近在眼前
I'm a stupid man. The answer's right there.

157
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,310
實則遠在天邊
It's just beyond me.

158
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,390
也許他知道
Maybe he knows.

159
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,550
是的我看到了那是蹼
Oh, yes, I see. They are webbed.

160
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,530
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

161
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,430
8 9 有10個趾頭 真不可思議
eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.

162
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,470
他們說你有鰓
They tell me, too, that you have gills.

163
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,270
排列整齊的鰓 是已經退化還是真的有用?
Isotropic gills. Are they merely vestigial or are they functional now?

164
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,750
我叫葛雷格 我是說過來給你點
My name is Gregor. I've just come to pay you a little vi... vi...

165
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,590
老天啊
Oh, my God.

166
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,750
抱歉 我不是笑你
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.

167
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,830
只是有點興奮 你的鰓能用
I'm excited. Your gills. They're functional.

168
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,590
大自然的鬼斧神工啊 你能在水堜I吸
Icthyus sapien. You can breathe in the water.

169
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,550
你能潛多深?
How deep can you go? Look, I'm only here...

170
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,230
我來這兒只是想來好好瞭解下你
Look, l'm only here because I want to learn more about you.

171
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,390
我也不怪你 告訴我
I can't say that I blame you. But tell me:

172
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,150
- 我沒有同族 - 噢 那就是魚式退化
- I have no "kind." - Oh, fish rot.

173
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,590
我好奇地是之前沒有 還是現在沒有呢
I'd be surprised if there weren't others, and if there aren't,

174
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,110
還是最終會有呢
there will be eventually.

175
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,470
唔 我來是因為有個問題要問你
Anyway, I've come here because I need to ask you a question.

176
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,470
你的泥土從哪兒來的?
Where... Where did your dirt come from?

177
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,870
從陸地來的嗎?
Is it from Dryland?

178
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,190
你看得懂這個嗎?
Do you know what this is?

179
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,510
古時候的人做了壞事 是不是
The ancients... They did something terrible, didn't they?

180
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,350
才導致了這個滿是水的世界 就在幾百 好幾百年前
To cause all this water. Hundreds... Hundreds of years ago.

181
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,430
如果我告訴了你 你肯開鎖嗎?
If I tell you, will you open this lock?

182
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,750
我沒鑰匙
I haven't a key.

183
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,590
- 這下面有一個繫纜耳 - 什麼?
- There's a mooring cleat down there. - What?

184
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,670
- 那勝過任何鑰匙 - 繫纜耳?
- Good as any key. - A mooring cleat?

185
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,550
我不會傷害任何人 我只想離開
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.

186
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,310
你在那媟F嘛?
What's your business there?

187
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,470
- 快走吧 - 我不是個有膽識的人
- Move along! - I'm not a brave man.

188
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,750
如果你真知道陸地的事 請告訴我 求你了
If you know anything about Dryland, please tell me. Please!

189
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,190
別把它帶進墳墓
Don't let it die with you.

190
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,830
不 別 別 別 停下來!
No, no, no, no. Stop!

191
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,270
我們決定這名變種人
it is our decision that this mute-o...

192
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,550
的確對我們造成威脅
does, indeed, constitute a threat.

193
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,590
因此為了公共安全
Therefore, in the interest of public safety,

194
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,230
他被判處回收之刑
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled...

195
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,190
遵照慣例執行
in the customary fashion.

196
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,990
行刑
Proceed.

197
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,790
抱歉了
I'm sorry.

198
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,710
化骨為漿
Bones to berries.

199
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,430
抽脈為藤
Veins to vines.

200
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,270
肢骨化為大樹 血漿變鹽水
His tendons to trees. His blood to brine.

201
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,430
他的生命詭異而怪誕
Too strange for life he was.

202
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,910
變種人即將離我們而去
This mute-o now does leave us,

203
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,830
我們在神明面前收下他的恩澤並銘記他
recycled and entombed, in the presence of him who leads us.

204
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,790
是掠海者 正從太陽的方向攻過來了
Smokers! Dead out of the sun!

205
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,470
大家各就各位
To your posts!

206
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,990
老天啊 偶滴神啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

207

- 大開殺戒 - 進攻
- Kill! - There!

208
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,950
在城牆內很安全
We are safe behind these walls.

209
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,470
是吧?
Aren't we?

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,390
放我出來!
Let me out!

211

把門撞開來
Break down the door!

218
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,070
老天爺啊!
My God!

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,630
Ha!

220

速戰速決拿下這座環礁基地
We'll have this atoll in no time.

Well, excuse me!

270
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,550
我是不是說過攻擊結束前絕不能放任何人走?
Did I say anybody could leave before the battle was over?

271
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,550
- 是不是? - 是的 是的

275
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,630
誰能告訴我 為什麼那艘船還在不停地開火
Answer me this, somebody. Why is that boat still firin'?

276
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,430
- 那夥計叫啥名來著? - 查克
- What's that cousin's name? - Chuck.

277
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,630
- 嘿 查克 - 他正把他的槍口拖向我們這邊
- Hey, Chuck! - He's pulling him right into us.

278
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,970
也許他對查克這個叫法沒反應
Maybe he doesn't answer to "Chuck."

279
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,230
叫他查爾斯 查爾斯
Call him "Charles." Charles!

280
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,350
讓他停下來!叫他停下來
Stop him! Stop him!

281
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,790
查爾斯
Charles!

282
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,590
再見了 夥計們
Adios, cousins.

283
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,630
她一定在這兒 繼續找
She's here somewhere. Keep lookin'.

284
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,350
停止!
Stop it!

285
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,570
你搞什麼鬼啊?
What you got?

286
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,390
還留了幾個活口在那邊 但卻問不出什麼
Couple of heartbeats over there. Aren't sayin' much.

287
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,890
如果你們有注意到這鮮紅的血
If you'll notice the arterial nature of the blood

288
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,510
都是從我頭上這個窟窿流出來的
comin' from the hole in my head,

289
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,870
你們就應該想到我們今天真得過得很不爽
you can assume that we're all havin' a real lousy day.

290
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,790
所以現在 我要知道有紋身小女孩在哪兒
So here it is: I need to know about that tattooed girl.

291
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,670
誰先說誰就能活命
First one that tells me lives.

292
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,150
我看到一個女孩 我看到
I saw a girl. I saw, I saw...

293
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,550
是 她身上有一個很大的紋身
It was... Sh-She had a big tattoo on her.

294
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,715
你贏了 重新來
You won. Start over.

295
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,910
我看到一個女孩 雖然不是很肯定
I saw a girl. I'm not sure,

296
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,790
但我想她上了那艘有三個船身的船
but I think she got on that boat with three hulls.

297
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,250
就是那艘浪費了我1000千克汽油的船嗎
The boat that cost me a thousand G's of go-juice?

298
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,390
是的 那個變種人的船
Yeah, the mute-o's boat.

299
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,390
- 變種人? - 是的 他身上有一些裂縫
- Mute-o? - Yeah. He got these slits here.

300
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,750
就像是魚鰓一樣
Like... Like fish gills.

301
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,190
他不算是地道的人類了
He wasn't really a man.

302
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,830
應該是一個偶然的進化
A fluke of evolution.

303
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,750
噢 抱歉 一個偶然的
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of, uh...

304
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,310
- 進化 - 我知道
- Evolution. - I know!

305
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,270
- 不!不要 你說過不會殺我的 - 我說過那話?
- No! No, you said you wouldn't kill me! - Did I say that?

306
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,430
- 有誰聽到我說過嗎? - 是的 沒錯 你說過
- Witnesses, anybody, did I? - Yes, yes, yes! You said...

307
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,950
- 你確實說過 - 噢 我可能是說過
- You said it. - Oh, I may have.

308
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,910
可能是說過
I may have.

309
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,390
給飛機加滿油 讓它出去巡邏
tank up that sky boat; send it out on patrol.

310
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,350
我們得睜大眼
We gotta keep an eye out...

311
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,750
好好留意那個人魚怪物
for that ichthy-freak.

312
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,630
你到過那兒 對吧?
You been there, haven't you?

313
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,950
陸地?
Dryland?

314
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,310
你知道它的方位
You know where it is.

315
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,310
對 我知道它的方位
Yeah, I know where it is.

316
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,950
那麼 我們要去那兒嗎?
And, uh... And we're going?

317
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,990
你和我可以
You and I are.

318
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,750
那孩子我們得讓她下船
The kid we gotta pitch over the side.

319
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,630
- 什麼? - 我的船破了
- What? - My boat's tore up.

320
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,270
我剛堵上了漏洞減少了進水
I'm takin' on water.

321
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,710
幸好我還有那東西能過濾二次淡化水
I'd be lucky to get half a hydro ration out of that.

322
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,470
你知道 我說了我不會喝的
You know... I said I won't drink.

323
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,990
可以堅持整整12天?
For 12 days?

324
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,590
算了吧 最好犧牲你們其中一個
No. It's better one of you dies now...

325
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,710
免得你們死得很痛苦
than both of you die slow.

326
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,910
等一下 等等
Wait. Wait.

327
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,550
我們救了你一命 幫助你逃出生天
We saved your life. We got you out.

328
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,670
不 助我是為了幫你們自己罷了 我們算是扯平了
No, you got me out so you could get out. We're even.

329
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,750
她會煮飯 也會抓魚
She can cook. She can fish.

330
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,030
- 我也會 - 那我的項鏈給你 拿著
- So can I. - Then take my necklace. Take my necklace.

331
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,470
- 我在下面能找到更好的 - 別 聽著
- I got better ones below. - No, look!

332
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,430
哦
Oh.

333
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,550
在環礁基地經歷的一切後
After what you went through back there on the atoll,

334
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,710
我完全明白你想這麼做的原因
I can understand why you would want to.

335
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,790
但她還只是個孩子啊
But she's a child.

336
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,350
那還有其他問題了嗎
Is there something else then?

337
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,350
埃諾拉 到下面去
Enola! Go below.

338
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,430
埃諾拉
Enola.

339
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,950
是啊 你自己也說了
Yeah. You said so yourself.

340
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,670
出海漂泊很長時間了
Been out there a long time.

341
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,430
幾小時之前 我不過是你們眼中值得回收成泥土的傢伙
Couple hours ago, I was potential dirt to you.

342
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,870
- 我們並不像那些人 - 你們沒差別
- We're not like that. - You all are.

343
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,750
知道我當時真正的想法嗎?
Know what I was really thinkin'?

344
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,950
為什麼我不趁自己清醒時把你們都扔下海呢
Why I don't drop both of you in my wake right now.

345
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,830
我對你沒任何興趣
You got nothin' I need.

346
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,070
你立馬帶我們到陸地去
You're taking us to Dryland.

347
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,390
殺人可沒那麼簡單
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

348
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,790
- 相信我 要殺我就更不容易了 - 我們也是
- Believe me. I'm not the one to start on. - Both of us!

349
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,870
你打算用那玩意兒指著我多久?
How long you plan to hold that on me?

350
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,070
需要多久就多久
As long as it takes.

351
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,750
- 那好吧 - 不!
- Okay. - No!

352
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,590
放我出去
Let me out of here!

353
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,510
該死的你在哪兒呢 別碰我的孩子
Where the hell are you? Don't you touch my child.

354
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,550
過來啊
Come here!

355
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,470
好了 現在別動了 明白嗎?很好
Okay, now don't move, okay? There.

356
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,870
看起來真不錯 真的
Ohh. Oh, lookin' real good, yeah.

357
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,230
好了 好了
There. There.

358
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,230
搞定了
All done.

359
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,270
就現狀而言 在視覺的深度上可能會有一點小問題
Now, there may be some small problem in depth perception.

360
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,230
是嗎 它最好別影響到我擊近球技術[高爾夫]
Well, it better not screw up my short game.

361
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,150
- 怎麼樣? - 很酷 我喜歡 是啊
- Well? - Looks good. I like it. Yeah.

362
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,270
- 我覺得它比你的真眼還好看 - 好看多了
- I like it better than your real eye. - Much better.

363
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,950
- 你覺得呢 多碧? - 說實話像狗屎一樣
- What do you say, Toby? The truth. - Looks like shit.

364
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,910
這就是我喜歡孩子的原因 不會說謊
That's why I love children. No guile.

365
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,710
真的像狗屎一樣
It does look like shit.

366
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,710
感覺更像冰狗屎
And it feels like cold shit!

367
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,190
帝剛?什麼事?
Deacon? What...

368
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,790
抱歉 只是深井那邊出了點狀況
I'm sorry. L-lt's just that there's a problem in the pit.

369
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,790
可能需要您擺駕前去看看
Maybe you should come.

370
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,710
起駕
Let's drive.

371
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,950
到深井 別驚動了沿途的那些美景
The pit. Don't bother with the scenic route.

372
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,950
走啦!
Drive!

373
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,230
嘿 這開起來順手多了
Hey, it's drivin' better.

374
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,590
滾開點兒
Get off!

375
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,990
閃開 別占道
Get over there. Get out of the way.

376
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,150
好吧 行了 行了 好吧 好吧
All right, all right, all right. Okay, okay.

377
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,910
祝福你們 兄弟們 祝福你們 祝福所有的兄弟們
You guys are great. Bless all you cousins over there.

378
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,390
繼續努力 有成長就有進步 繼續努力 繼續努力
Keep up the good work. Growth is progress. Growth is progress.

379
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,070
有人嗎? 嘿 上面的
Somebody! Hey, up there!

380
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,110
把井蓋打開
Take it off!

381
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,910
- 什麼事? - 帝剛大人
- Yes. - Your Deaconship.

382
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,950
你好 早上好 或者該晚上好
Hello. Good morning. Or night,

383
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,590
管它的
whichever the case may be.

384
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,390
- 有什麼事?我是大忙人 - 我想應該通知您了
- What is it? I'm a busy man. - I thought you should know.

385
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,150
準確算來我們只剩下
We're down to exactly...

386
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,190
4尺9寸深的柏油了
four feet, nine inches of black stuff.

387
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,630
十分感謝 老大
Thank you, sir.

388
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,030
經過提煉之後能有多少千克?
How many G's is that after refinin'?

389
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,390
可能能灌滿三個加油器
Maybe three refuelers.

390
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,110
- 夠我們用上兩個月 - 親愛的喬
- We'll burn through that in two lunars. - Sweet Joe!

391
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,870
誰能告訴我這個地方到底怎麼了
Will somebody please tell me what's happened to this place?

392
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,950
供需太不平衡了
We outgrowed it.

393
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,910
好了 現在最重要的就是那個有紋身的小姑娘
All right, the only thing that is important is the tattooed girl.

394
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,310
我們不可能為了省油而不去找她
We don't spare any go-juice findin' her.

395
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,910
那麼在其他地方就別再浪費了
We don't waste it anywhere else.

396
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,430
你們去關掉所有的牽引車
You cancel all those tractor pulls...

397
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,390
和其他耗油的東西
and all that stuff until later.

398
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,430
聽懂了嗎?
You got it?

399
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,910
陸地可是塊沃土啊
Dryland is the mother lode.

400
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,030
打起精神來
On your toes.

401
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,390
太好了
Excellent.

402
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,230
- 嗨 - 閃開
- Hi. - Move.

403
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,750
埃諾拉 埃諾拉 過來
Enola! Enola, come here!

404
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,950
快點
Come on!

405
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,910
埃諾拉 到這邊來
Enola, come over here.

406
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,150
嘿
Hey!

407
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,990
- 你在幹嘛呢? - 給你船好好打扮一下 它太醜了
- What are ya doin'? - Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

408
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,230
- 你在哪兒拿來的? - 下面拿來的
- Where did you get this? - From down below.

409
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,030
這是我的 別碰我的東西
This is mine! You don't touch anything of mine.

410
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,000
我是為你畫的
I drew it for you. 

411
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,430
不需要你畫任何東西 聽明白了嗎?
You don't draw on anything. You understand?

412
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,990
什麼?
What...

413
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,190
這是我的船 就得按我的喜好來
This is my boat. I got it the way I like it.

414
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,070
你們佔了我的空間還拖慢了我的速度
You take up space and you slow me down.

415
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,550
她只是個小姑娘而言
You know, she's just a little girl.

416
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,870
- 還不懂你的規矩 - 想留在船上?
- She doesn't know your rules. - You wanna stay?

417
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,910
就好好教教她
You teach her.

418
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,430
埃諾拉 我對你說過什麼來著?
Enola, what'd I tell you?

419
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,190
你根本不是這麼鐵石心腸的 你自己清楚?
You're not so tough. You know that?

420
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,390
你殺過多少人?
How many people have you killed?

421
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,110
12?還是20個?
Ten? Twenty?

422
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,550
- 你很聒噪啊 - 我聒噪是因為你幾乎都一言不發的
- You talk a lot. - I talk a lot 'cause you don't talk at all.

423
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,590
多少個?
Now how many?

424
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,230
- 包括小女孩嗎? - 我才不怕你
- Including little girls? - I'm not afraid of you.

425
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,310
我跟海倫說過如果你剪剪頭髮就不會這麼難看了
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly if you cut your hair.

426
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,350
知道嗎 你老是說個不停
In fact, you talk all the time.

427
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,510
- 讓人就像陷入了風暴堣@樣 - 埃諾拉
- It's like a storm when you're around. - Enola!

428
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,230
嘿 你在幹嘛?
Hey! What are you doing?

429
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,390
- 海倫 - 你這渾球 她不會游泳
- Helen! - You bastard! She can't swim!

430
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,390
救救我!海倫
Help me! Helen!

431
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,030
海倫 救救我
Helen, help me!

432
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,590
海倫
Helen!

433
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,830
海倫 救救我
Helen, help me!

434
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,990
海倫!海倫
Helen! Helen!

435
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,510
堅持住
Hold on!

436
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,070
看著我 看著我 看著我
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

437
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,110
求求你 回來 拜託了
Oh, please, come back. Please!

438
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,590
拜託!噢 拜託了!
Please! Oh, please!

439
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,110
嘿!
Hey!

440
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:06,070
堅持住 行了 沒事了
Hold on. Okay, almost...

441
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,510
那
there.

442
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,670
謝謝 我發誓
Thanks. I swear,

443
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,630
如果你在碰她的話
if you ever touch her again...

444
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,990
渾球 轉過來
You son of a bitch. Look at me.

445
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,510
只要你會上床睡覺那你永遠也別想醒了
You will go to bed that night, and you will never wake up.

446
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,310
- 閉嘴 - 怎麼了?
- Shut up. - What?

447
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:35,030
- 是掠海者嗎 - 對
- Smokers? - Yeah.

448
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,310
我們能避開他們嗎?
Can't we outrun them?

449
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:41,310
除非我沒收帆
Not with my sail down.

450
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,510
- 你犯什麼傻呢? - 多友好地揮手啊
- What are you thinkin' about? - That's a nice touch.

451
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,510
是他們
That's them.

452
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,550
別傷了那孩子
Don't hit the kid.

453
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,990
嘿!
Hey!

454
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,990
你個懦夫
Coward!

455
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,470
可惡
Fuck!

456
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,630
住手
No!

457
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,470
切斷它
Cut it!

458
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,550
加油 加油啊
Come on! Come on!

459
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,550
好吧 好吧
All right. Okay.

460
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,750
真的很抱歉
Oh, I'm really sorry.

461
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,910
真抱歉 你讓我別無選擇
I'm sorry. But you didn't give me much choice.

462
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,950
我知道
Oh, I know.

463
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,790
你開溜了 我 要幹嘛?
But you ran away. L... What?

464
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,750
你要幹嘛 別 求你了 不要啊
What are you do... No! Please, no! No!

465
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:58,230
永遠別再碰我船上的任何東西了
Don't ever touch anything on my boat again.

466
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,550
她已經向你道歉了
She said she was sorry!

467
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,390
意味著你應該有所回應才對
That means you're supposed to say something back!

468
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,590
你在說話嗎?
Did you say somethin'?

469
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,750
那個孩子 他帶著那個女孩嗎?
The child... did he have the girl with him?

470
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,270
- 對 - 如果我們馬上出發的話
- Uh-huh. - Seems to me if we launch now,

471
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,390
我們大概可以在這媞I住他
we can cut him down just about here.

472
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,630
- 只要他不改變航道的話 - 那不可能
- If he doesn't change course. - Ah, it's not likely.

473
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:15,350
他很狡猾的 那個臭魚人
He's a wily one, that ichthy-demon.

474
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,910
如果他知道自己已經被發現了
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,

475
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,790
他可能推測我們必定認為他改變了航向
he'll expect us to expect him to change course,

476
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:25,510
所以他一定不會改變航向
which is exactly why he'll keep his heading.

477
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,750
重點是 他這是要去哪兒
The important question is, where's he heading?

478
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:32,430
以及他清楚自己船上的貨物價值嗎
And does he know how precious his cargo is?

479
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,790
他正向這兒趕 我們就在這兒攔截他
I say that he's headed here, and we take him here.

480
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,910
- 浪人? - 對
- Drifter? - Mm-hmm.

481
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,910
我們要停下來嗎?
Are we gonna stop?

482
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,910
- 看那旗子 - 他升起旗子
- Look at the flag! - His flag's up.

483
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,070
我以為你們都互相幫助
I thought you all stopped for each other.

484
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,030
也許他有食物
Well... maybe he has some food!

485
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,310
大家都不守規矩了
Don't find many who follow the rules anymore.

486
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:13,030
有話快說 你想幹嘛?
Well, make it quick. What's your business?

487
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,030
交換東西
Trade.

488
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,950
你有樹脂嗎?
You got any resin?

489
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:30,670
樹脂?那是我的 全是我的
Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind. He's out of his mind. I don't have any resin.

490
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,150
你在海上很久了 對吧?
You been outwater a long time, haven't you?

491
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,510
是取笑我吧 哈 樹脂 你的東西可不夠換啊
Must be jokin' me, man. Resin! You don't got enough.

492
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,750
有食物嗎?
How 'bout food?

493
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,790
能請你再說一次嗎
Could you say that again, please?

494
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,830
- 有食物嗎? - 啊 有 食物
- How 'bout food? - Ah, yeah, food.

495
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,470
是啊 要有食物就好了
Yeah, that'd be good, eh?

496
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,550
我都沒吃過 知道嗎 已經好長時間了
I haven't eaten in, well, you know, forever.

497
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,110
你們哪個是廚子?
Which one of you two is a cook?

498
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,910
因為我通常喜歡泡女服務生
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress.

499
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,990
像你說的 我沒多少東西
Like you said, I don't have much.

500
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,390
聽著 讓我看看 那邊那些植物如何?
Now listen, eh? Let's see. What do I have to do?

501
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,150
我們可以從你那邊那個迷你的小果園開始
We can start with that wee orchard you got over there.

502
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:12,110
好了 呆在那兒別動
All right, hold it there.

503
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,710
- 咱們談談 - 可以
- We can talk. - Fair enough.

504
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,990
真是漂亮的竹竿 不是嗎?
It's a nice rod, isn't it?

505
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,030
我很喜歡 釣竿很棒
I like that rod. It's a nice rod.

506
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,190
你這兒可真是妻妾成群啊 不是嗎
Got yourself a wee harem goin' here now, do ya?

507
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,910
這女人怎麼賣?
What you want for the women?

508
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:46,510
我們不是拿來賣的
We're not for sale.

509
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,150
非賣品?根本不存在非賣品
Not for sale? There's no such thing as not for sale.

510
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,590
非賣品 是非賣品嗎
"Not for sale"! Not for sale, eh?

511
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,030
- 成雙賣 還是分開賣 - 不
- Are they a pair or would you consider sellin' 'em separate? - No.

512
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:01,030
除非你能有樹脂或船帆可以交換
Our business is done here unless you got some resin for sale you can part with.

513
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,530
我已經告訴你了 我沒有那些
I told you once already, I don't have it.

514
01:02:03,565 --> 01:02:05,950
我沒有 沒有 沒有
I- I-I don't have it. Don't have it. Don't have it.

515
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:10,110
已經好幾個月沒見到半個人來交意了 等等 先等等
Haven't seen neither for trade in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

516
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,750
我確實有些能讓你改變想法東西
I do have somethin' that'll make you change your mind.

517
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:20,630
讓你無法抗拒的東西
Somethin' that you can't pass on.

518
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:24,990
我從一個難民環礁基地弄來的
I took it off an Atoller refugee camp.

519
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,990
是整個氏族一輩子的積蓄
The life savings of the entire clan.

520
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,950
紙張
Paper.

521
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:43,590
這可是紙啊 你見過紙嗎?你看看
It's paper. Have you ever seen paper? Look at it.

522
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,590
聞聞看
Smell it.

523
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,470
我一直珍藏著就是為了特別交易
I been savin' it for a special trade.

524
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,110
別這麼做
Don't you do it.

525
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,070
我是不是找錯談判對象了啊
You know, maybe I'm talkin' to the wrong person here.

526
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,270
這艘船到底是誰的?究竟是你的船還是你的呢?
Whose boat is this? Is it your boat or your boat?

527
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,990
不 不 船是他的 但我們不是他的
No. No, it's his boat. But he doesn't own us.

528
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,030
半小時
Half an hour.

529
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,710
他瘋啦還是怎麼了
Out of his mind somethin' there.

530
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:20,750
我用這個至少能換個半打姑娘 你知道嗎?
I got two pages in here, man! I mean, I'd get half a dozen girls with this, you know.

531
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,550
就半小時
Half an hour.

532
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,710
- 要不要隨你 - 別這樣
- You tradin' or not? - Don't.

533
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,750
閉嘴
Shut up.

534
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:31,310
好吧
Okay.

535
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,230
不然換45分鐘跟那邊那個幼齒吧
Forty-five minutes with the wee one right there.

536
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,790
我更中意調教幼齒 你該明白的?
I like to do the talkin', if you know what I mean.

537
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,510
不行
No!

538
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,630
好吧 快過來 來 來 來 來啊
Fair. Come, come, come, come, come!

539
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,990
不 就在我的船上
No. My boat.

540
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,270
- 可以 可以 好的 好的 當然沒問題 - 海倫
- Fair enough. Fair enough. Good, good, good. Aye. - Helen.

541
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,950
- 坐下來 - 埃諾拉 乖乖聽他的話
- Sit down. - Enola, just do as he says.

542
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,190
這對現在的我而言只算得上一小會兒
It's been a while for me now.

543
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:49,910
但事實上 那卻又不止一小會兒
Guess it's been more than a while, actually.

544
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,990
我只有半個小時 半個小時 半個小時啊
I've only got half an hour.Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour...

545
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,030
對了 對了 很好
Great, great, great...

546
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:05,910
你好美 有人這麼稱讚過你嗎?
Ooh! You're so beautiful. Aye! Anyone ever told you that?

547
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,910
少來這套 你這是在幹嘛?不就是睡一覺嘛
Give me that. What are you doin'? It's just a game.

548
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,230
我 我 我們剛剛只是想跟她玩玩
Oh, I, um... I, uh... We was just playin'.

549
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:20,350
不換了
The trade's off.

550
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,310
我改變主意
I changed my mind.

551
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:26,350
你不能反悔
Well, um... Well, you can't do that.

552
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,990
都已經成交了啊
I mean, a deal's a deal, eh?

553
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,910
我說了反悔了
I just did.

554
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:33,110
嘿
Hey!

555
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:37,790
她已經是我的了 不 不 我還沒碰到她呢 不行
She's mine. Aye. No. No, no I own her. But... No.

556
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,790
- 走吧 - 行啊 行啊 走吧 走吧 很好 很好
- Go on. - Get, get, get. Go, go, go. Good, good.

557
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:45,190
別走得太遠 這耽擱不了一分鐘
But don't go too far now. This won't take but a minute.

558
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:55,750
我恨這艘船 我恨透了這條船
I hate this boat. I hate this boat!

559
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:58,390
你這渾球
You bastard.

560
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:07,670
對於擁有這麼多東西的人來說你真是摳到家了
You... You're pretty stingy for a man who's got everything, aren't ya now?

561
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,350
你這渾球
Ah, you bastard!

562
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:39,910
我的船在哪兒啊?
Where's me boat?

563
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,190
我的小船呢?
Where's me boat?

564
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,430
帶我到船上
Help me to me boat.

565
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:57,150
我的船
Ow! Me boat.

566
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,030
我的船
Me boat.

567
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,950
想幹嘛 別!
What the... No!

568
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,510
用這個根本抓不到任何東西 就是個廢物
Never catch anything with this. It's useless.

569
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,990
聽著 我道歉 你說得很對 那竿子是廢物
Look, I'm sorry. You were right about the pole.

570
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,830
你說得對是對 但我們還是得吃東西啊
You were right, but we have to eat.

571
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,390
嘿 別裝聾作啞的
Now I know you can hear me!

572
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,990
我們可以自己抓魚來吃 但至少你得告訴我們該怎麼做
Now we can fish for ourselves. You show us what to do.

573
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:03,310
你要知道 即使是你也要吃東西的
You must know how. Even you gotta eat!

574
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,870
你們倆乖乖給我坐著
You just sit there.

575
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,310
- 什麼玩意?... - 我不知道
- What... - I don't know.

576
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:10,150
滿足了?
Happy now?

577
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,190
你不喜歡我哼歌 對吧?
You don't like my singing, do you?

578
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:37,150
聽海倫說你之所以討厭我唱歌是因為你不能唱
Helen says you don't like my singing 'cause you can't sing.

579
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:45,990
- 你試著聆聽過嗎? - 聽什麼?
- Ever try and listen? - To what?

580
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,270
世界之音
The sound of the world.

581
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:58,350
- 我什麼也聽不到 - 那是因為你整天都吵個不停
- I don't hear anything. - That's because you're too loud,

582
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,390
你老是動個不停
and you're movin' around all the time.

583
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,230
靜下來試試
Try sittin' still.

584
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,310
來顆魚眼?
Eyeball?

585
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,630
我也想要他那樣的腳
I wish I had feet like his.

586
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,670
也許我就能游泳了
Then maybe I could swim.

587
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,430
埃諾拉
Enola.

588
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,230
抱歉
Sorry.

589
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,390
我之前還從來沒有見過不會游泳的人
Never met a person couldn't swim before.

590
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:48,070
我就不會
I can't.

591
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,550
別人都說我是個怪胎
People say I was weird.

592
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,550
也許確如他們所說
Maybe they were right.

593
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,510
也許你也確如他們所說
Maybe they were right about you too.

594
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,350
埃諾拉要把這個還給你
Enola wanted to give you this.

595
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:36,310
還有這個
And this.

596
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,510
她以後不會再拿了
She won't take it again.

597
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,790
你跟她長得不太像
You don't look much like her.

598
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:51,376
我不是她的生母
Well, I'm not her mother,

599
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:52,722
如果你想知道的是這個的話
if that's what you're asking.

600
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:54,070
你卻視她如親生一樣
You act like it.

601
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,070
她背上那些圖是什麼?
What are those marks on her back?

602
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,630
沒什麼 只是好看而已
Nothing. They're just fanciful things.

603
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,190
- 她畫的那些也是嗎? - 她只畫她見過得的東西
- Like what she draws? - She draws what she sees.

604
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,110
她就如一面鏡子
She's like a mirror.

605
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,230
大家一度認為都認為她是…
People on the atoll thought she was a...

606
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,630
怪胎?
Freak?

607
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:20,190
對
Uh-huh. Yeah.

608
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,230
我卻認為她很特別
I just thought she was special.

609
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:33,670
我並不是要給她 只是...
I'm not givin' it to her. It's just...

610
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,510
借她用
A loan.

611
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:38,550
對 我不是給她
Yeah. I'm not givin' it to her.

612
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:47,550
陸地很美嗎?
Is Dryland beautiful?

613
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:51,510
你會親眼所見的
You'll see.

614
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,670
埃諾拉
Enola?

615
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,710
埃諾拉 你在幹嘛?
Enola, what are you doing?

616
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:25,310
- 那些怪物會殺了她的 - 它們都在睡覺
- Those monsters'll kill her! - No, they're asleep now.

617
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:30,430
抱住我的脖子
Hands around my neck.

618
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:35,910
讓你的手和腳在水的帶領下動起來
Let the water tell your arms and legs how to move.

619
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:37,190
我們要潛下去 憋住呼吸
We're goin' down. Hold your breath.

620
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:19,630
- 怎麼了? - 那是什麼?
- What is it? - What is it?

621
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,750
易物交易的前哨站
Barter outpost.

622
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,830
你說我們今天會到達陸地的
You said we'd get to Dryland today.

623
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:28,950
今天 明天 都無所謂
Today. Tomorrow. What's it matter?

624
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,630
我需要樹脂
I need resin.

625
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:47,670
- 那是什麼話? - 是葡希文 他們自己的語言
- What is that? - It's PortuGreek. Their own language.

626
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,910
不然就是如我所料
Or so I thought.

627
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:21,630
呃
Ah.

628
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:25,030
- 那就是我要的小姑娘 - 是啊
- There's my girl. - Yeah.

629
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,750
您好啊 小可愛 快到我們懷抱堥荍a
Howdy, darlin'. Come on in here now.

630
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:00,670
- 怎麼回事? - 是掠海者
- What's going on? - Smokers.

631
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,990
搞什麼鬼?
What the hell?

632
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:12,550
穿幫了快發信號
He's spotted us. Sound it!

633
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:16,510
發信號快發信號快發信號
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!

634
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:30,030
噢哦
Yahoo!

635
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:40,910
埃諾拉
Enola!

636
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:54,550
到右舷去馬上
Starboard side! Now!

637
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:57,550
站到椅子上
Get in the chair!

638
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:06,710
注意他入網了
Watch it. He's clearin' the net.

639
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,190
你去掌舵
Go to the helm.

640
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,510
- 把舯板打開 - 舯板?
- Get the centerboard! - Centerboard?

641
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:27,190
- 舯板是啥? - 到底是要我做什麼?
What centerboard? I don't know what to do!

642
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,950
太遲了 快過來
It's too late. Over here!

643
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,550
不是吧
No!

644
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:14,670
來福槍拿來 想做好一件事
Gimme that rifle. Boy, if you wanna do somethin' right,

645
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,470
自己動手才能豐衣足食
you've got to do it yourself.

646
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:19,510
好的
All right.

647
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:27,910
- 我打到他了 - 我說我們...
- I winged him. - I say we load...

648
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:31,110
快點派一艘船去逮那怪物
all the go-juice onto one boat and run the freak down.

649
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:34,590
你派了十艘都沒能抓住他 你還想一艘就能得逞
You can't catch him in ten boats, and you wanna send just one?

650
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:37,150
你是在講冷笑話吧
Well, I pray that you're jokin'.

651
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,710
把追蹤器給我拿來
Bring me the trackers.

652
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:55,910
他受傷了
He's hurt.

653
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:58,270
他們不是來抓她
It's not what you think. They weren't after her.

654
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,030
- 我是親眼所見 - 什麼意思?
- I saw what I saw. - What?

655
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,270
別再跟我撒謊了
No more lies.

656
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:12,030
她背上的究竟是什麼
What are the marks on her back?

657
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:14,790
大家都說那是通往陸地的指示
People say it's the way to Dryland.

658
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:17,550
陸地只是個神話
Dryland's a myth!

659
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:20,590
不可能 你自己說過你知道它在哪兒的
No! You said so yourself that you know where it is.

660
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,630
你說過
You did.

661
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:29,950
你居然蠢得去相信見都沒見過的東西
You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen before.

662
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:32,290
我不光見過 我更摸過
I've seen it. I've touched it! 

663
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,550
那泥土比你帶來的更肥沃 色澤更深
Dirt that was richer and darker than yours.

664
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,550
就在發現埃諾拉的那個籃子
It was in the basket we found Enola in!

665
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:39,110
- 那根本就不存在 - 你憑什麼那麼肯定?
- It doesn't exist! - Well, how can you be so sure?

666
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:43,950
因為我的航程早已遠過了那些夢想之地 而我卻從未見到過
Because I've sailed farther than most have dreamed, and I've never seen it.

667
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:48,750
但你船上的那些東西呢
But the things on your boat!

668
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:51,110
我船上的東西 指什麼?
"Things on my boat" what?

669
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:54,710
你船上那些個沒人見過的東西
There are things on your boat that nobody has ever seen!

670
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,910
像這些貝殼吶?
What are these shells?

671
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:00,070
還有那個反光鏡啊
And that reflecting glass?

672
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:04,630
以及那個音樂盒 那個
And th-the music box? That...

673
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:08,270
那不是陸地來的 那是哪兒來的呢?哪兒來的?
Well, if not from Dryland, then where? Wh-Where?

674
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:13,110
你想看陸地嗎?
You wanna see Dryland?

675
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,830
你真的那麼想看嗎?
You really wanna see it?

676
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,590
我就帶你到陸地
I'll take you to Dryland.

677
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:29,870
下水
Get in.

678
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,910
- 埃諾拉怎麼辦? - 這兒的空氣只夠一個人用
- Well, what about Enola? - There's only air for one.

679
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:41,270
- 快下來 - 沒事的
- Get in the water. - It'll be all right.

680
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,990
別亂來啊?
Don't touch anything.

681
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:55,790
好了嗎?
Okay?

682
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,830
真沒想到
I didn't know.

683
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,510
這麼久以來
All this time...

684
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,550
真沒想到
I didn't know.

685
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,550
沒有人知道
Nobody does.

686
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:47,590
我們逃得掉嗎?
Can you get us outta here?

687
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:51,190
要我說倒是兩種可能性
I'd say there're two chances o' that.

688
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,630
- 嘿! - 那就是無處可逃 無計可施
- Hey! - No way and no how.

689
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:57,430
早就叫你請我喝一杯的 上來
Shoulda bought me that drink. Come on!

690
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,350
上來 快
This way. Come on!

691
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:08,350
首先正式地自我介紹一下
Proper introductions first.

692
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:11,990
我就是帝剛
I'm the Deacon.

693
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:18,670
如果不記得我這張臉了 可能是
If you don't recall the face, perhaps it's

694
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,030
因為之前我的臉可並不是這個樣子
'cause I didn't always look like this.

695
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:27,670
我一直在猜她到底躲在哪
Now, ahem, I suspect she's somewhere real close.

696
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:30,790
為了找到她 我們不得不痛心地拆了這艘船
So we can tear this boat apart lookin' for her,

697
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:33,670
但是我更希望有人能告訴我她躲在哪兒
but I'd rather somebody tell me where she is.

698
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,550
誰先說誰就能活下來
And the first one that does that, lives.

699
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:41,110
而亞軍就 事實上 壓根就不會有亞軍
And the runner-up... Well, actually, there are no runners-up.

700
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:46,310
哦 親愛的喬 這可是我的最愛
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.

701
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:49,270
自己挑吧 第一名還是第二 生還是死
Choose 'em. One, two. Live or die.

702
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:53,990
就我個人而言
You know, personally,

703
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:57,030
我更喜歡留下你來好好享用
I'd rather shoot the sperm-of-the-devil here.

704
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:00,230
但就算你知道
Huh? But you know somethin'?

705
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:02,710
我想你也不會告訴我的 對嗎?
I don't think you're gonna tell me, are ya?

706
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,710
真遺憾
Huh? Too bad.

707
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:09,430
好了 有什麼要說的嗎
Come on, eh? What do you say?

708
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:11,430
她又不是你同類
She's not your kind.

709
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:15,390
你根本就沒有同類吧
You don't even have a kind.

710
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:19,550
你告訴了他 他還是會殺了我們倆
If you say it, he'll still kill us both.

711
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,990
咱就別相互為難彼此了
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

712
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,950
如果你不說
If you don't tell me,

713
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:32,470
我以波塞冬海神之名起誓我一定燒了你的船
I swear to Poseidon I will torch your boat.

714
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:42,510
提醒我一下 之前遇到這種情況時是怎麼做的來著?
Refresh my memory. What happens when neither of 'em talks?

715
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,470
- 從沒遇到過 - 從沒遇到過
- Never happened before. - Never happened before.

716
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:48,230
好啊
All right!

717
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:53,350
如果他們不說 就幹掉他們
If they won't tell us where she is, do 'em! Both of 'em! Kill 'em now!

718
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:56,350
- 不要 - 不要
- No! - No!

719
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,350
真好騙 把她帶過來
So gullible! Bring her here.

720
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:03,590
- 到手了 - 不 放開她!
Take and ye shall receive! - No! Leave her!

721
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:06,390
今天的布道就到此結束啦
So ends your daily sermonette!

722
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:10,310
我們只要能搞懂這個地圖就成了 把她倒過來衣服揭開
All we gotta do is figure out this map. Turn her upside down.

723
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:13,670
- 你看得明白嗎? - 不明白
- Does that mean anything to you? - No.

724
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:17,310
回帝斯號去慢慢琢磨 兄弟們 打道回府了
We'll figure it out back at the 'Deez. Back at the 'Deez, boys.

725
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,670
好好看著她 小心點
Careful with her. Careful with her!

726
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,630
- 他們呢? - 兩個都幹掉
- What about them? - Do 'em both.

727
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,350
船也燒了
Torch the boat.

728
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,670
我們得潛下水
We have to go under!

729
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:34,670
不行 我不像你能在水下呼吸
No, I can't breath like you!

730
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,670
我可以讓我們倆同時呼吸
I'll breathe for both of us.

731
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,310
海倫
Helen!

732
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:12,790
海倫 救救我!海倫 海倫
Helen, help! Helen! Helen!

733
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:46,070
我的船
My boat.

734
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:57,390
埃諾拉
Enola.

735
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,550
這算什麼?把她的鐐銬解開
What is this? Get those chains off her.

736
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,590
怎麼?我們是野蠻人嗎?
What are we, barbarians here?

737
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,150
我的老天啊 太沒人性了
Goodness gracious. Sakes alive.

738
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,590
快滾 滾出去 你這個又肥又討厭的東西
Come on. Outta here, you big, nasty animal, you!

739
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,630
Well rub-a-dub-dub.

740
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:19,910
要過來坐我的大腿上嗎?
You wanna come over here and sit on my lap?

741
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:22,710
不要?
No? Ahem.

742
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:25,790
來根香煙如何?
How 'bout a cigarette?

743
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:29,390
抽根香煙快樂似神僊
Nothin' like a good smoke if you miss your mom.

744
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:31,390
多小開始抽都沒關係
Never too young to start.

745
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,390
不要 好吧 有些東西我知道你一定喜歡
No. Well, I got somethin' right here I know you'd like.

746
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:40,630
你很喜歡畫畫 對吧?
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

747
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:46,790
他們都可以給你
Huh? Now they're yours...

748
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,230
只要你幫我一個忙 行嗎?
if you help me with just one problem, all right?

749
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:57,750
你背上的那個紋身
Now, ahem... Now that tattoo on your back... Ahem.

750
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:03,910
我聽說那似乎是一份地圖是嗎 聽說那其實是地圖
I've been told that, uh... that's actually a map?

751
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,550
那是通向陸地的指示
It's the way to Dryland.

752
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:11,550
看來我們找到地方了
Now we're gettin' someplace.

753
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,190
你能教我怎麼看嗎?
Could you teach me how to read that?

754
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,870
功虧一簣啊
Setback.

755
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:27,310
那你曾聽你的哪位朋友討論過那個紋身嗎
Well, have you ever heard any of your friends talk about it?

756
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:32,470
比如你媽媽或者是你的寵物魚叔叔 他說過什麼嗎?
You know, like your mommy or your pet fish? Did he say anything?

757
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:34,910
你不該嘲笑他的 他會不高興的
You shouldn't make fun of him. He wouldn't like it.

758
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:40,510
我才不管他喜不喜歡 他弄瞎了我的一隻眼
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like. He took out my eye.

759
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:46,470
如果再讓我看到他 我一定要開他的腦吸乾他的腦髓
And if I ever see him again, I'm gonna cut open his head and eat his brains!

760
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,750
他會喜歡那樣嗎
You think he'd like that?

761
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:52,630
根本殺不了他他可比你狠多了
Can't kill him. He's even meaner than you are.

762
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:55,750
但他不在這兒
But he's not here.

763
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:57,750
更不會來這兒
And he ain't comin'.

764
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:59,710
所以根本沒人會來救你
And no one's gonna save you.

765
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,990
他一定會來救我的 一定會
He'll come for me. He will.

766
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:07,270
那你最好乖乖地從實招來
Then you better tell me what I wanna know

767
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:09,470
否則他能救到的只會是個屍骨無存的你
or he can see what's left of you in a goddamn jar.

768
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,030
我們死定了 對不對?
We're going to die here, aren't we?

769
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,910
是嗎?
Aren't we?

770
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:55,990
逃出環礁基地後
After the atoll,

771
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,790
我曾要獻身給你
when I offered myself to you,

772
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,830
你當時為什麼會拒絕呢?
why didn't you take me?

773
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,670
因為你並不是真得想要我
'Cause you didn't really want me.

774
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,630
你不是自願的
Not really.

775
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:10,750
我睡了很久嗎?
Have I been asleep long?

776
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,470
我做了個夢
I was dreaming.

777
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,870
很奇怪
It's funny.

778
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:26,710
我一直以為陸地是漂浮著的
I always thought Dryland floated.

779
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:28,430
它會隨風而動 所以才那麼難找
That it drifted with the wind.

780
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:30,110
為什麼你會如此地深信不疑
That's why it was so hard to find.

781
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:32,550
你為什麼深信有陸地?
Why did you believe in it so much?

782
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:36,430
因為我們根本無法在海洋中生存
Because we weren't made for the sea.

783
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:40,910
看看我們的手和腳
Got hands... and feet.

784
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:43,670
那是用來行走的
We're supposed to walk.

785
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,630
我好想念她的聲音
I miss her sound.

786
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:53,070
你呢?
Don't you?

787
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:58,510
海倫
Helen!

788
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,710
不 不對 不對 海倫 抬頭 你頭上
He... No, no, no. Helen, up here. Above you!

789
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:04,230
葛雷格
Gregor!

790
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:11,510
很機靈啊 燒了你們的船
Smart thinking to burn your boat.

791
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:15,190
要不是看到了濃煙 我永遠都無法找到你們
Without the smoke, I never would have found you.

792
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,270
和你一起的那傢伙是誰
Who's that with you?

793
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:21,070
那個魚神?真的是你嗎?
Ichthyus Sapien, is that really you?

794
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:25,110
我把繩子扔給你們 抓牢了 我把你們拉上來
I'll throw the rope down. You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

795
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:30,870
海倫 埃諾拉呢?
Helen. Where's Enola?

796
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:36,310
被掠海者抓走了 幸好有他在 我才倖免於難
Smokers took her. They'd have me too if it weren't for him.

797
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:40,670
我的朋友 謝謝你 你非常地有人性
My friend, thank you. Very human of you.

798
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,190
快把你們的東西拿上 動作快 快
Go grab your things quickly. Quickly. Come.

799
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:55,110
看到了嗎?就在這下面
You see? Right down there.

800
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,190
那是基地的一些倖存者 我們正準備重新開始
There's several of us survivors. We'll just start over again.

801
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,190
你不能要求我們都去救她
You can't ask us to go get her!

802
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,630
埃諾拉正是這場劫難的根源
Enola's the reason we're in all this trouble.

803
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:09,310
反正他們又不會殺了她 他們跟我們一樣在找陸地
They don't have any reason to kill her. They need to find Dryland just like we do.

804
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:13,310
- 毫無疑問 - 連那個浪行者都願意去了 我們怎麼能無動於衷呢
- Of course. - If the Mariner's willing to go, why not us?

805
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:15,630
他願意就讓他去呀
If he wants to go, then let him!

806
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:18,910
我們根本不想收留你們 你和那個女孩都是
We don't want you here! You or the girl!

807
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:23,350
海倫 那個航海人給你的這些紙紙
Helen. The papers the Mariner brought you...

808
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:28,070
上面的文字和紋身上面的文字是同一種語言 上面有號碼
It's the same language the tattoo is written in. They're numbers.

809
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:31,550
- 葛雷格 你和她一樣瘋狂 - 我們不能呆在這兒
- Gregor, you're as crazy as she is! - We can't stay here!

810
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:32,790
我們再不抓緊時間
We're wasting valuable time.

811
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:33,950
更多的掠海者就會追來了
More Smokers will come.

812
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,110
我們需要馬上轉移
We need to be moving now!

813
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:39,630
我的朋友們 你們還不明白嗎 想要找到陸地我們就需要那個孩子
My friends, don't you see we need this child if we want to find Dryland?

814
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,675
- 我才不會去呢 - 誰都不去
- I'm not goin'. - Nobody is.

815
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:44,070
我們遠遠就看到他們的煙
We've seen their smoke on the horizon!

816
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,910
- 搞懂那個是什麼了嗎? - 這些數字嗎?當然 我想我搞懂了
- Know what that is yet? - The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

817
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:52,590
這看起來應該是過去的地理坐標 是緯度和經度
It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location: Latitude, longitude.

818
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:57,390
不過 有點不合理 這些數字 似乎是顛倒的還是怎麼了
It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something.

819
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:59,710
- 確實是顛倒的 - 整個世界嗎?
- It's upside down. - The world?

820
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,310
兩級也是顛倒的?
The poles have reversed themselves?

821
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:04,750
我一直在勘測水下的城市
I've been mappin' the cities below.

822
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,910
世界並不是在水中建起的 而是被水淹沒了
The world wasn't created in a deluge. It was covered by it.

823
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:14,190
- 那話簡直是褻瀆神靈 - 不 那是事實
- That's blasphemy! - No, it's true.

824
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:18,990
我親眼所見那些土地就在我們身下這片海底
I've seen it with my own eyes. There is land. It's right under our keel.

825
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:21,110
- 根本就沒有干地 - 有些是
- None of it's dry anymore. - Some is.

826
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:27,190
埃諾拉確實曾到過那兒 在看到她畫得那些畫之後 我很肯定
Enola's been there. I know that now. I saw what she drew.

827
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:31,110
所以你是為了陸地找她
So that's why he's going after Enola... to find Dryland.

828
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:33,910
我才不管陸地
I don't care about Dryland.

829
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,830
真是太荒謬可笑了 要怎麼找掠海者啊
This is ridiculous. Going after the Smokers?

830
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:39,110
他連他們打哪兒來的都不知道
He doesn't even know which direction they came from.

831
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:44,070
- 我說讓他走吧 - 沒有他更好
- I say let him go. - We're better off without them anyway!

832
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:47,910
只要她還活著 我就一定把她帶回來
If she's alive, I'll bring her back to you.

833
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:52,430
得了 別管那個變種人了 海倫別 如果他帶她回來我們都會死
Forget the mute-o, Helen. If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

834
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:56,230
我不能袖手旁觀 我們得去幫幫他 不能讓他一個人冒險
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him. I can't ask him to do this alone.

835
01:38:56,310 --> 01:39:00,310
噢 放心吧 親愛的 你想去的話簡單得多
Oh, don't worry, my dear. You're not going to have to.

836
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:09,190
你們搞懂紋身的涵義了嗎?
You got that tattoo figured out yet?

837
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:11,910
如果再平整點就容易多了 最好又大又平整
It would be easier if it was flat... big and flat.

838
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:14,870
- 這得攤平了來看 - 你到底想幹嘛?
- It needs to be flat. - What you got in mind?

839
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:19,190
最好能從她背上割下來 就可以攤平了 甚至裱起來
Well, you cut it off her back. You stretch it, mount it.

840
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:22,950
- 我們就能慢慢研究了 - 把她帶下去等我叫她
- Give us a proper look. - Take her down below until I holler.

841
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:25,230
偉大的喬 就要到頭了
Saint Joe, we're close.

842
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:29,910
在經歷了幾世紀的屈辱之後
After centuries of shame.

843
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:03,950
- 他們開始有點暴躁了 - 聽出來了
- They're gettin' ugly. - Don't I know it.

844
01:41:04,812 --> 01:41:06,812
可以開始了 兄弟
Announce me, cousin.

845
01:41:10,932 --> 01:41:12,972
注意了 他來了
Hey. Here he is.

846
01:41:13,012 --> 01:41:14,972
帝剛
Deacon!

847
01:41:15,052 --> 01:41:17,652
熱情點 兄弟姐妹們起來
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

848
01:41:19,212 --> 01:41:22,732
睜開你們的雙眼打開胸襟
Turn your eyes and open your hearts...

849
01:41:22,812 --> 01:41:25,172
你們仁慈的佈施者
to your humble benefactor,

850
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:29,092
你們靈魂的引導者 命運的依托者
your spiritual shepherd and dictator for life,

851
01:41:29,172 --> 01:41:32,172
帝斯號的帝剛
the Deacon of the 'Deez.

852
01:41:53,812 --> 01:41:56,892
- 當心! - 是我的!是我的!
- Look out! - It's mine! It's mine!

853
01:42:03,612 --> 01:42:06,892
- 帝剛 - 哇
- Deacon! - Wahoo!

854
01:42:06,972 --> 01:42:12,772
孩子們 我可愛的孩子們
Children. Children of the provider.

855
01:42:12,852 --> 01:42:16,732
帝斯號的好船民 安靜下來聽我說
Citizens of the good ship. Please now, hear me speak.

856
01:42:20,772 --> 01:42:23,812
- 我見到了一個幻象 - 我們已經受夠了你的那些幻象了
- I've had a vision. - Yeah, we're tired of your visions!

857
01:42:23,892 --> 01:42:26,172
你對我們許諾過的土地在哪兒呢
What about the land you promised us?

858
01:42:26,252 --> 01:42:29,052
是啊!是啊
Yeah! Yeah!

859
01:42:29,132 --> 01:42:31,252
你們對信仰太不堅定了
Oh ye of little faith.

860
01:42:31,332 --> 01:42:33,732
我看到的這個幻象如此美好
I've had a vision so great...

861
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:37,132
美好到讓我感激涕零
that as it came to me, I wept.

862
01:42:37,172 --> 01:42:41,252
- 讓我以為那只是南柯一夢 - 這不是波恩的摩托艇嗎?
- And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder, - Is that Bone's ride?

863
01:42:41,332 --> 01:42:43,412
- 座位上是血跡嗎 - 我見到的
- Is that blood on the seat? - I saw...

864
01:42:43,652 --> 01:42:47,372
你知不知道我看到了什麼
And you know what it is that I saw.

865
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:51,332
我看到...陸地
I saw... the land.

866
01:43:24,452 --> 01:43:26,732
霍斯 是你嗎?
Horse, that you?

867
01:43:31,332 --> 01:43:34,412
慢慢的開進來 別浪費時間
Look, just bring it in slow, okay? I don't have all day.

868
01:43:34,492 --> 01:43:37,972
霍斯
Horse!

869
01:43:38,052 --> 01:43:40,452
慢慢開進來
Just bring it up slow.

870
01:43:41,492 --> 01:43:44,452
慢慢開進來!
I said slow!

871
01:43:49,092 --> 01:43:53,252
你不應該這樣 你會惹麻煩
Shouldn't be doing that. You're gonna get in trouble.

872
01:43:53,332 --> 01:43:55,492
是啊 是啊
Ha. That's right.

873
01:43:55,732 --> 01:43:59,772
而你沒有害怕 因為你在期盼著你那可愛的怪物叔叔來救你
You're not afraid. You've got your pet freak comin' to rescue you.

874
01:43:59,852 --> 01:44:04,332
他才不是怪物呢 他隨時都能要了你的命
He's not a freak, and he can take you anytime.

875
01:44:04,372 --> 01:44:08,452
他殺人無數 冷血無情 更不會心慈手軟
He's killed dozens of people, and he doesn't have any mercy or anything.

876
01:44:08,532 --> 01:44:10,812
他連小女孩都殺
He even kills little girls.

877
01:44:12,532 --> 01:44:14,172
難道我們就會嗎
Haven't we all?

878
01:44:16,252 --> 01:44:18,212
該死的
Shit.

879
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:20,452
是霍斯
It's Horse.

880
01:44:21,892 --> 01:44:24,332
- 去找他 去找他 - 快
- Find him. Find him! - Come on!

881
01:44:24,412 --> 01:44:28,812
是的!是的!是的!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

882
01:44:28,892 --> 01:44:32,412
- 快來 - 有點緊張了 是嗎?
- Come on. - Gettin' nervous, aren't you?

883
01:44:36,852 --> 01:44:38,772
我不會緊張
I don't get nervous.

884
01:44:40,052 --> 01:44:42,492
如果有河 我們就建壩蓄水
And if there's a river, we'll dam it.

885
01:44:42,572 --> 01:44:47,092
如果有樹 我們就大興土木
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it.

886
01:44:47,172 --> 01:44:50,252
因為此刻我說的可是發展
'Cause I'm talkin' progress here.

887
01:44:50,332 --> 01:44:53,372
是的 我說的是開拓
Yes, sir. I'm talkin' development.

888
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:57,452
- 是的 - 因為我們馬上就能盡情地舔吸
- Yeah! - For we shall suck and savor...

889
01:44:57,492 --> 01:45:02,052
陸地的沁人芬芳
the sweet flavor of Dryland.

890
01:45:02,092 --> 01:45:03,972
你的臉已經都紅了
Face is all red.

891
01:45:04,052 --> 01:45:09,132
海倫說過如果有人的臉紅得已經成了關公那樣
Helen said with anybody that has a face that red,

892
01:45:09,172 --> 01:45:11,332
那他不是曬得太久就是喝多了
he's had too much sun or too much to drink.

893
01:45:11,412 --> 01:45:14,432
行了 我受夠了 看我不毀了你的小臉蛋兒
All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn your face.

894
01:45:14,432 --> 01:45:15,452
時間剛剛好
Almost time.

895
01:45:15,532 --> 01:45:19,572
- 怎麼了? - 只不過是剛剛聊起了她朋友
- What's up? - We're just talkin' about our friend.

896
01:45:22,052 --> 01:45:24,932
- 他叫什麼名字? - 她沒有名字
- What's his name? - He doesn't have a name.

897
01:45:25,012 --> 01:45:27,492
所以死神無法找到他
So death can't find him.

898
01:45:32,932 --> 01:45:36,852
他無親無故 沒有任何後顧之憂
Doesn't have a home or people to care for.

899
01:45:36,932 --> 01:45:39,852
他渾身是膽 無所畏懼
He's not afraid of anything, men least of all.

900
01:45:39,932 --> 01:45:43,412
他就像颶風一樣強大而迅猛
He's fast and strong like a big wind.

901
01:45:43,492 --> 01:45:46,852
在水下他更是來去自如
He can hear a hundred miles and see a hundred miles underwater.

902
01:45:46,932 --> 01:45:50,972
他能躲在太陽陰影下
He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun.

903
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:54,932
他可以潛伏在你身後 你死了都不知道
He could be right behind you, and you won't even know it 'til you're dead!

904
01:45:57,412 --> 01:45:59,412
讓你的嘴歇歇
Give it a rest.

905
01:46:00,852 --> 01:46:02,852
他會來救我的 一定會
He'll come for me. He will.

906
01:46:02,892 --> 01:46:05,412
- 我們就是開拓先鋒 - 是嗎?
- We are the people... - Yeah?

907
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:09,012
- 希望如此 - 這是神的恩澤
- Well, I hope he does. - The Lord's creation.

908
01:46:10,252 --> 01:46:12,172
記住你說過這句話
Remember you said that.

909
01:46:13,332 --> 01:46:16,132
瞧瞧我們
Look at us.

910
01:46:16,172 --> 01:46:18,852
- 好好看看今天還在這堛漣畯 - 是的
- Look at us here today. - Yeah!

911
01:46:18,932 --> 01:46:22,452
陸地不僅僅是我們的夢之地
Dryland is not just our destination,

912
01:46:22,492 --> 01:46:24,572
也是我們的命運
but it is our destiny!

913
01:46:34,092 --> 01:46:36,492
快去找他 把她找出來!
Find him. Find him!

914
01:46:36,532 --> 01:46:38,652
我該怎麼找到
How can I find...

915
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,012
這片樂土
this glorious place?

916
01:46:42,052 --> 01:46:44,892
他對我說
And he said to me:

917
01:46:44,932 --> 01:46:48,892
你將遇見一個孩子
"A child shall lead you."

918
01:46:50,332 --> 01:46:52,412
一個孩子
A child.

919
01:46:52,492 --> 01:46:54,892
- 看哪 - 是時候了
- And behold! - It's time.

920
01:46:54,972 --> 01:46:58,012
我們的救星
The instrument of our salvation!

921
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:07,972
我們迷途上的嚮導
Our guide in the wild.

922
01:47:08,052 --> 01:47:10,372
黑暗堛獄滽餈O
Our beacon in the darkness.

923
01:47:10,412 --> 01:47:12,372
把她的背轉過來 諾德
Turn her around, Nord.

924
01:47:12,412 --> 01:47:15,252
她已經給我展示了路徑
She has shown me the path!

925
01:47:19,652 --> 01:47:23,172
在最神聖的時刻來臨之際
And before the holy-most moment is upon us,

926
01:47:23,252 --> 01:47:26,652
讓我們為了偉大的老喬徹底瘋狂一把
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe.

927
01:47:29,972 --> 01:47:33,452
把我們這蛈p廢鐵的破船開動起來 全速前進
And let's get this tub of shit up to speed.

928
01:47:39,532 --> 01:47:41,492
Yep.

929
01:48:19,532 --> 01:48:21,452
快劃
Pull!

930
01:48:21,532 --> 01:48:24,252
- 快劃 - 快劃
- Pull! - Pull!

931
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:26,412
- 快劃 - 快劃
- Pull. - Pull!

932
01:48:41,012 --> 01:48:42,812
Ow.

933
01:48:46,412 --> 01:48:49,652
- 我們要往哪個方向劃? - 我他媽的也毫無頭緒
- So which way we rowin'? - I don't have a goddamn clue.

934
01:48:49,692 --> 01:48:51,652
別緊張
Don't worry.

935
01:48:51,732 --> 01:48:54,692
等他們察覺被騙時起碼也過了一個月了
They'll row for a month before they figure out I'm fakin' it.

936
01:48:54,732 --> 01:48:57,492
但是為什麼呢
But, um, wh-wh...

937
01:48:57,532 --> 01:49:00,652
你想知道實情 不能告訴這些人
Oh, you want details. Well, I'm not tellin' these savages...

938
01:49:00,692 --> 01:49:03,012
我們還沒搞懂地圖
that we haven't solved the map yet.

939
01:49:03,092 --> 01:49:08,452
我向他們保證有結果 我會不擇手段得到結果的
I promised them results, and I'll get 'em if I gotta cut 'em out of her goddamn back.

940
01:49:09,772 --> 01:49:13,212
那是誰?那是誰?
Who is that? Who is that?

941
01:49:14,332 --> 01:49:16,732
也許是個划槳的後備吧?
Maybe one of the spare rowers?

942
01:49:24,652 --> 01:49:27,412
你怎麼不去划槳呢?
Why aren't you rowin'?

943
01:49:36,092 --> 01:49:38,132
- 是他 - 確實是他
- It's him. - It is him.

944
01:49:39,492 --> 01:49:42,212
你們麻煩可大了
You guys are in so much trouble.

945
01:49:45,092 --> 01:49:49,412
真的想不到 是那個魚人
Well, I'll be damned. It's the gentleman guppy.

946
01:49:49,452 --> 01:49:53,252
他好像洗不掉的狗屎
You know, he's like a turd that won't flush.

947
01:49:53,332 --> 01:49:56,052
把那小姑娘給我
I want the girl.

948
01:49:58,412 --> 01:50:03,532
知道嗎?我以為你只是很蠢 老兄
You know, I thought you were stupid, friend.

949
01:50:03,612 --> 01:50:06,532
不過我確實太低估你了
But I underestimated you.

950
01:50:06,612 --> 01:50:09,612
你簡直就是個低能兒
You're a total freakin' retard.

951
01:50:12,812 --> 01:50:16,172
我只要那個女孩兒
I want the girl. That's all.

952
01:50:16,212 --> 01:50:20,892
哦 在這荒涼殘敗的地球上 你憑什麼認為你辦得到?
Well, what on this screwed-up Earth makes you think you're gonna get her?

953
01:50:29,292 --> 01:50:31,252
你知道這是什麼嗎?
You know what this is?

954
01:50:35,532 --> 01:50:38,092
我丟下去你就毀了
I drop it, you burn.

955
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:41,932
- 大家都會毀了 - 等等 等等 先等等
- We all burn. - Now wait, wait, wait, wait.

956
01:50:42,172 --> 01:50:45,812
都別衝動
Ahem. Let's not do anything rash here.

957
01:50:45,892 --> 01:50:49,212
你確定她真的值得你這麼做嗎?
I mean, uh, are you sure she's worth all this?

958
01:50:49,292 --> 01:50:52,412
她總是嘮叨個沒完沒了 從不閉嘴
She never does stop talkin'. She never shuts up.

959
01:50:52,492 --> 01:50:54,772
- 我清楚得很 - 那你是為什麼?
- I noticed. - What is it then?

960
01:50:54,852 --> 01:50:57,252
是為了地圖?
Huh? It's the map.

961
01:50:58,692 --> 01:51:01,452
她是我的朋友
She's my friend.

962
01:51:01,532 --> 01:51:04,332
我真是感動得熱淚直流
Golly gee. A single tear rolls down my cheek.

963
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:07,332
你居然要為了你的朋友準備慷慨就義
I mean, you're gonna die for your friend.

964
01:51:08,732 --> 01:51:10,652
如果真有必要的話
If it comes to that.

965
01:51:12,892 --> 01:51:15,152
只不是虛張聲勢罷了 我要殺了他
He's bluffing. I'll kill him.

966
01:51:15,152 --> 01:51:17,412
他不是虛張聲勢 他從不會那麼做
He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.

967
01:51:17,492 --> 01:51:18,652
給我閉嘴
Shut up!

968
01:51:19,932 --> 01:51:25,212
我打賭你絕不會扔的 我的朋友
I don't... l-l... I don't think you're gonna drop that torch, my friend.

969
01:51:25,292 --> 01:51:28,852
- 為什麼? - 因為你又不是瘋子
- Why not? - Because you're not crazy.

970
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:35,292
不
No!

971
01:51:42,252 --> 01:51:44,852
哦 真是感謝上帝
Oh, thank God.

972
01:52:01,812 --> 01:52:04,212
當心
Look out!

973
01:52:04,252 --> 01:52:06,692
逮住他
Get him!

974
01:52:06,732 --> 01:52:10,332
快點 可惡
Let's go, goddamn it!

975
01:52:10,412 --> 01:52:15,012
別淨站著 給我上
Don't just stand there! Kill somethin'!

976
01:52:18,332 --> 01:52:20,292
這就是你偉大的幻景嗎?
Was this your big vision?

977
01:52:28,852 --> 01:52:32,812
我一直渴望能開開這玩意兒
Oh, yeah! I've always wanted to drive this monster.

978
01:52:36,052 --> 01:52:39,372
是他 在那
There he is! There he is!

979
01:52:42,452 --> 01:52:44,732
在那
That's him! There!

980
01:52:57,652 --> 01:53:01,332
不 放手
No! Let go!

981
01:53:10,892 --> 01:53:13,412
放手
Let go!

982
01:53:16,732 --> 01:53:19,372
- 放手 放手 - 飛行員
- Let me go! Let go! - Pilot!

983
01:53:19,452 --> 01:53:21,812
- 飛行員 - 放了我
- Pilot! - Let me go!

984
01:53:21,892 --> 01:53:23,812
放了我!
Let go!

985
01:53:23,892 --> 01:53:25,852
放了我!
Let go-o-o-o!

986
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:31,012
你乖乖呆在水下就沒事了
You should've stayed underwater.

987
01:53:40,852 --> 01:53:45,292
你知道怎麼駕駛飛機嗎?幸好我懂 真慶幸對吧
Now you know how to fly an airplane? You're lucky I do.

988
01:53:45,332 --> 01:53:48,332
別這樣 給我聽話點兒
Ow! Now you stop it! You behave yourself now!

989
01:55:20,772 --> 01:55:22,692
它正在下沉
It's going down.

990
01:55:22,772 --> 01:55:27,892
- 你能看見它在下沉 - 葛雷格 降到那艘船上方
- You can see it sinking. - Gregor, bring us right down on top of it.

991
01:55:27,972 --> 01:55:30,092
- 快點 葛雷格 - 別擔心
- Hurry, Gregor! - Don't worry.

992
01:55:30,172 --> 01:55:32,092
快點
Hurry.

993
01:55:43,932 --> 01:55:47,052
埃諾拉 快上來
Enola! Up here!

994
01:55:47,132 --> 01:55:49,092
抓住繩子
Grab on!

995
01:55:54,172 --> 01:55:56,132
他們倆都抓住了嗎
Are they on yet?

996
01:55:59,652 --> 01:56:02,452
- 怎麼回事兒? - 不知道
- What is it? - I don't know!

997
01:56:02,492 --> 01:56:04,172
不
No!

998
01:56:13,572 --> 01:56:18,932
抓到你了 我要好好地收拾你一頓
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip your cute little lungs out.

999
01:56:33,172 --> 01:56:35,772
用力 差不多了
Pull! Almost.

1000
01:57:14,812 --> 01:57:16,572
不
No!

1001
01:57:16,652 --> 01:57:19,572
不 埃諾拉
No! Enola!

1002
01:57:20,932 --> 01:57:23,252
偉大的喬啊 這一桿進洞真漂亮啊
Saint Joe. Hole in one.

1003
01:57:23,332 --> 01:57:27,172
- 海倫 - 不 埃諾拉 - 海倫
- Helen! - No! Enola! - Helen!

1004
01:57:27,212 --> 01:57:29,932
嘿!嘿
Hey! Hey!

1005
01:57:36,572 --> 01:57:40,612
哦 不 快想辦法啊 該怎麼辦
Ohh. Oh, no! Quick! What are we gonna do?

1006
01:57:43,892 --> 01:57:46,332
把這頭綁緊
Tie this off.

1007
01:57:49,852 --> 01:57:52,692
- 快點 - 綁緊這頭
- Hurry! - Tie it!

1008
01:57:57,172 --> 01:57:59,772
- 好了 - 噢
- Got it! - Ah!

1009
01:58:12,652 --> 01:58:15,092
快拉他們上來
Get 'em up now.

1010
01:58:25,172 --> 01:58:28,692
- 當然 北是南 - 什麼
- Of course! North is south. - What?

1011
01:58:28,772 --> 01:58:32,092
- 南是北 - 我會游泳了
- South is north. - I was swimming.

1012
01:58:32,132 --> 01:58:34,332
- 我看到了 - 我的朋友們
- I saw. - My friends.

1013
01:58:34,412 --> 01:58:36,612
朋友們 快來看看
My friends, look.

1014
01:58:36,692 --> 01:58:39,052
只要我測出來太陽高度角
If I take a bearing from the sun

1015
01:58:39,052 --> 01:58:41,412
再顛倒一下埃諾拉背上的那些數據
and reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,

1016
01:58:43,612 --> 01:58:46,772
那麼 陸地就應該是在那個方向
then Dryland is that way!

1017
02:00:48,132 --> 02:00:51,132
是淡水
It's fresh!

1018
02:00:51,212 --> 02:00:53,892
是淡水 全是淡水
All of this! It's fresh!

1019
02:01:01,092 --> 02:01:03,052
不!
No!

1020
02:01:07,492 --> 02:01:09,932
哇哦
Whoo! Whoo!

1021
02:01:10,012 --> 02:01:12,292
我發現了點東西
I found something!

1022
02:01:25,012 --> 02:01:28,492
也許我們應該讓他們入土為安
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.

1023
02:01:28,572 --> 02:01:30,492
我想那是他們的風俗
I think it was their way.

1024
02:01:32,892 --> 02:01:34,892
他們一定早就知道自己將不久於人世了
They must have known they were dying.

1025
02:02:05,412 --> 02:02:07,332
我到家了
I'm home.

1026
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:20,892
- 航海人在哪? - 在外面
- Where's the Mariner? - He was outside.

1027
02:02:26,212 --> 02:02:28,892
等等 先等等!我想讓你看看這個
Wait. Wait! I want to show you this.

1028
02:03:41,332 --> 02:03:44,052
這可能是你有生以來第一次隻字不說吧?
First time in your life you got nothin' to say?

1029
02:03:58,932 --> 02:04:01,372
埃諾拉 我不得不馬上離開
Enola, I have to go now.

1030
02:04:01,452 --> 02:04:03,412
但你曾為了我去而復返
But you came back for me.

1031
02:04:05,492 --> 02:04:07,452
我喜歡你
I like you.

1032
02:04:12,572 --> 02:04:14,532
你為什麼要走?
Why are you leaving?

1033
02:04:17,372 --> 02:04:21,092
- 我不屬於這 我屬於外面的世界 - 你屬於這
- I don't belong here. I belong out there. - You belong here.

1034
02:04:24,372 --> 02:04:27,292
呆在這兒讓我覺得很彆扭 因為一切都是靜止的
It's too strange here. It doesn't move right.

1035
02:04:27,332 --> 02:04:30,172
海倫說那只不過是還沒有適應腳踏實地的感覺罷了
Helen said that it's only land sickness.

1036
02:04:31,372 --> 02:04:34,972
我們都有這種感覺 但很快就能適應了
We're all feeling it. It'll go away soon.

1037
02:04:35,052 --> 02:04:36,972
不只是如此
It's more than that.
