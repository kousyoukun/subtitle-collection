00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,837
(Narrator) 'The future.

00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,298
'The polar ice caps have melted,

00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,508
'covering the earth with water.

'Those who survived

00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:56,140
'have adapted to a new world.'

00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,309
Ah!

00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,022
(Speaking PortuGreek)

13
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,411
Bad luck, English.

14
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,708
But the Slavers are producing
a good grade epoxy these days.

15
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,087
Cost you a handful of dirt
or maybe that wind chime.

16
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,174
- What are you doing here?
- Just waiting.

17
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,343
Take your hand off the sail.

18
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,304
Take it off!

19
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,767
I've seen your boat before.
Haven't seen you.

20
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:51,935
Took it legal.

21
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:57,524
The previous owner was dead
on the tiller when I found it.

22
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,652
You had another hour
before I traded up again.

23
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:05,032
- Just improving my means.
- Well, I owe you, then.

24
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,619
No, thanks. I got all the supplies I need.

25
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,954
Just came from an atoll.

26
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,333
Eight days east, if you are interested.

27
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,712
Two Drifters meet.
Something needs to be exchanged.

28
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,925
I know the code,
but I'll give you this one for free.

29
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,428
Nothing's free in Waterworld.

30
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,888
(Chuckles) Yeah.

31
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,275
Smokers.

32
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,779
Just enough wind to get away clean.

33
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,701
(Drifter) Forget the bag!

34
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,543
It's not worth it.
You'll never make it with your sails down.

35
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:58,669
Hey!

36
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,213
Ha-ha-ha!

37
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,226
What can I say?

38
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,914
Joe, he's going for it.

39
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,708
What the hell...?

40
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,798
Never seen that before.

41
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,888
Here we go! Go! Drive! Drive!

42
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,769
Faster! Faster!

43
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:58,979
Whoo!

44
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,127
Come on! He's gonna get it!

45
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,066
- Go!
- Get him! Get him!

46
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,203
(Chuckles)

47
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,630
Oh, fuck! Shit!

48
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,930
No!

49
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,432
No! Argh!

50
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,939
(Smokers yell)

51
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,985
- (Gunfire)
- Argh!

52
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,988
(Drifter cries out)

53
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:05,230
(Man) Inbound!
Straight out from the gates!

54
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,198
InglÃªs!

55
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,914
Flags down, Drifter.
We've got enough traders.

56
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,881
(Murmuring)

57
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,051
- (Woman) What does he have?
- (Man) What's he got?

58
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,055
Dirt!

59
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,141
(Man) Open the gates!

60
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,974
(Chattering)

61
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,312
(Elder)
Bones to berries, veins to vine.

62
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:32,442
These tendons to trees,
this blood to brine.

63
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,738
Too old she was.
This woman does leave us,

64
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,742
recycled and enshrined
in the presence of him who leads us.

65
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,588
(Children chattering)

66
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,638
My eyes! That hurts!

67
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,349
(Child) What is that?

68
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,188
You know me?

69
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,984
- I know what you are.
- Good.

70
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,612
Then you know
if you look for trouble here,

71
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:22,075
you'll find more than you can handle.
You've got two hours.

72
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,664
I'll only need one.

73
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,927
He's coming over here.

74
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,768
- Me!
- You each get one

75
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,312
if everything's here when I get back.

76
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,443
(Man) Look at that.

77
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,406
- Pure dirt.
- (Gasps)

78
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,616
3.2 kilos.

79
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,079
How d'you come by so much of it?

80
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,500
Another atoll 30 horizons west of here.

81
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,337
- Where'd they get it?
- They didn't say.

82
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,424
(Man) We heard about that place.
Heard they was all killed.

83
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,637
- That's why they didn't say.
- Smokers?

84
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,932
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.

85
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,186
So what's it worth? We trading or not?

86
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,522
We'll tally it like...

87
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,525
pure hydro.

88
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,531
Works out to...62 chits.

89
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,411
- I want twice that.
- (People gasp)

90
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:55,252
- I just want one sip of hydro.
- No, not till you tell me.

91
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,672
She's got inkings on her back. I seen her.

92
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,342
They say if you read the marks
on the child,

93
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,428
they'll lead you all the way to Dryland.

94
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,557
- Dryland's a myth.
- Aw, some still believe.

95
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,852
They say the Smokers even got
an eye out for her.

96
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,773
Well, then,
we better keep it to ourselves.

97
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,507
- Help you?
- Yeah.

98
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,427
- Where's the store?
- You found it.

99
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,518
You don't have much.

100
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,563
You the man with the dirt?

101
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,082
<i>Skol.</i>

102
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,297
- One more.
- Make it two.

103
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,967
A man this rich will buy
for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

104
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,510
One.

105
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,351
That's an interesting pair of boots
you've got.

106
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,103
- Trade?
- No.

107
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,564
Shame.

108
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,862
(Whispers) That's her.

109
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,448
Enola, hey, what are you doing?

110
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,786
- No, you can't have that.
- I need another piece to draw some more.

111
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,497
I'll give it to you.
Just stay in the back.

112
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,125
With all those chits,
you could order up a bath.

113
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,921
- Why are you talking to me?
- Just being friendly.

114
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,012
- Is that a tomato plant?
- Yeah.

115
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:15,433
- You have a keen eye.
- I saw one in a picture. How much?

116
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,608
Half your chits.

117
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:39,374
- I'll take them, too.
- Take what? You bought everything.

118
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,334
I'll take them shelves.

119
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,465
So, what did you see out there
in your 15 months?

120
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,884
- Such as?
- An end to all this water.

121
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,262
You're asking the wrong person.

122
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,598
- The one they buried today.
- Uh-huh?

123
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,934
She found the only end there is.

124
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,275
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.

125
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,029
I'm not staying.

126
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,157
Oh, we're not asking you to.
All we want is your seed.

127
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:16,369
(Man) We can look to our own
for impregnation,

128
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:21,458
but too much of that sort of thing gets...
undesirable.

129
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:26,671
When she's pregnant, you go on your way
with all the supplies you need.

130
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,884
You don't have anything. You're dying.

131
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:40,101
No man stays out that long
and turns down a woman.

132
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,271
He's hiding something.

133
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,732
Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

134
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,152
(Whistles)

135
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,455
When the Elders say so, you can leave.
And not before.

136
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,309
Ah. Gills.

137
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,523
- Mutation!
- He's a Muto!

138
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,860
(Grunting)

139
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,698
Aaargh!

140
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,453
(Man) All of you, get him!

141
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,918
(Man) Throw the nets!

142
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,816
(Yelling)

143
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,778
(Man) He's a murderer!

144
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,783
Aargh!

145
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,412
By what right?

146
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,999
You pay me to keep the peace.

147
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,628
- This isn't it.
- No! He has killed one of us.

148
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,381
- He was defending himself.
- He needs to be destroyed!

149
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,508
- Kill him!
- That may be.

150
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,596
- Kill him!
- But not here, and not like this.

151
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,349
(Metal gears turning)

152
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,338
(Boy) What is it?

153
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,381
Hey!

154
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,802
(Man) Too tight! I can't get it off.

155
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,849
(Man) Open the gate!

156
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,480
(Chuckling)

157
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,242
(Humming)

158
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,842
Is it a map?

159
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,931
- You'd tell me if you knew, eh, Enola?
- Mm-hm.

160
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,312
- What are you drawing?
- I don't know.

161
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:17,110
Helen, look. Look at
the prodigal child's latest vision.

162
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,781
(He chuckles)

163
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:28,121
- How soon before we can leave?
- I have no idea yet where we can go.

164
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:31,708
I haven't figured out
the tattoo on her back.

165
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,169
I'm a stupid man.
The answer's right there. It's...

166
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,297
It's just beyond me.

167
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,302
Maybe he knows.

168
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,229
Ah, yes, I see.

169
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,189
They are webbed.

170
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,652
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.

171
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,740
They tell me, too, that you have gills.
Isotropic gills.

172
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:07,035
Are they merely vestigial or functional?

173
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,164
My name is Gregor. I've just come
to pay you a little vi...vi...

174
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,625
Oh, my God.

175
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,797
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm excited.

176
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:24,510
Your gills, they are functional. Ichthys
sapien. You can breathe in the water.

177
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,929
How deep can you go?

178
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:32,185
Look, I'm only here because I want
to learn more about you.

179
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,895
(Mariner spits)

180
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,401
You don't like humans very much, do you?

181
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,112
I can't say that I blame you.

182
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,491
But, tell me, are all of your kind
as bad-tempered as you?

183
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,997
- I have no kind.
- Oh, fish rot.

184
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:57,835
I'd be surprised if there weren't others.
If there aren't, there will be eventually.

185
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,883
Anyway, I come here
because I need to ask you a question.

186
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,679
Where... Where did your dirt come from?
Is it from Dryland?

187
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,058
Do you know what this is?

188
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,897
The Ancients, they did something terrible,
didn't they? To cause all this water.

189
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:22,276
- Hundreds, hundreds of years ago.
- If I tell you, will you open this lock?

190
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,865
I haven't a key.

191
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,494
- There's a mooring cleat down there.
- What?

192
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,622
- As good as any key.
- A mooring cleat?

193
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,460
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.

194
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,090
- I'll be right back.
- (Man) Gregor!

195
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:48,761
- What's your business there? Move along!
- I'm not a brave man.

196
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,723
If you know anything about Dryland,
please, tell me.

197
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,977
Please. Don't let it die with you.

198
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,645
No, no, no.

199
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,980
Stop!

200
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,815
(Man) Gregor?

201
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,733
Move along!

202
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:42,440
(Elder) After considerable deliberation
of the evidence at hand,

203
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:48,446
it is our decision that this Muto
does indeed constitute a threat.

204
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:52,617
Therefore,
in the interest of public safety,

205
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,995
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled

206
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,539
in the customary fashion.

207
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,999
Proceed.

208
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,424
I'm sorry.

209
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,058
Bones to berries, veins to vines,

210
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,355
these tendons to trees,
this blood to brine.

211
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,274
Too strange for life he was,

212
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:29,362
this Muto now does leave us,

213
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,989
recycled and entombed,

214
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:36,035
in the presence of him who leads us...

215
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,755
Smokers!

216
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,716
Dead out of the sun!

217
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,847
To your posts!

218
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,029
(Alarmed yelling)

219
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,240
(Woman) Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

220
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,377
Kill!

221
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,004
There!

222
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,172
Aaah! Aaah!

223
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,058
We are safe, behind this wall!

224
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,353
Aren't we?

225
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,531
Let me out! Let me out! I'll fight!

226
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,627
Get those bullets loaded!

227
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,648
Give me the key to the city now.

228
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,737
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

229
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,409
Floor it! Floor it! Go on!

230
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,135
(Woman screaming)

231
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,974
Swab it! Swab it!

232
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,769
Goddamn! More ammo!

233
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,161
Burn down the door!

234
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,667
Burn it down!

235
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,714
Argh!

236
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,718
We'll have this atoll in no time.

237
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,306
Crank it! Crank it!

238
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,186
Look!

239
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,524
Oh, no!

240
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,163
Keep that gas going! Fill 'em up!

241
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,593
Aaargh!

242
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,651
Aargh!

243
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,621
Helen! Come quickly! Helen!

244
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,456
Helen!

245
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:06,740
You're not supposed to go yet!
Infernal machine!

246
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,872
Gregor? Gregor! Wait!

247
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:16,417
Helen, I tried. There was an accident.
I couldn't make it stop. Hurry!

248
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,920
You can make it if you try!
Up those stairs! Run!

249
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,965
- Wait!
- Quickly! I'll throw you a rope!

250
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,260
- Run quickly!
- Throw the rope now!

251
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,096
Throw the rope! No!

252
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,307
- No!
- Wait!

253
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,019
- Don't leave us!
- No!

254
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:37,313
I'm sorry! It was an accident!

255
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,152
Helen!

256
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,487
Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!

257
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,875
Shoot him. Shoot him.

258
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,302
Aaargh!

259
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:28,405
If I let you out of here,
you're taking us with you.

260
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,366
Sure.

261
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,996
Enola, get down.

262
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,041
Come here. Get down.

263
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,168
Hurry! Come on!

264
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,464
Get the gate!

265
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,784
Argh!

266
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,724
Argh!

267
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,401
(Mariner) Hurry up!

268
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,361
Kamikaze! Come on!

269
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,059
That made a hole.

270
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,399
(Constant gunfire continues)

271
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,199
Find her! Get the girl!

272
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,371
There!

273
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,633
Go! Get that guy! Go! Kill him!

274
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,139
- Wow!
- Enola!

275
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:12,611
- You're too slow!
- Run to the other side.

276
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,864
Come on!

277
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,915
Grab on! Hold on, hold on.

278
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,548
It's stuck! I can't make it through!
Let her go!

279
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,969
- (Bullets fly)
- Just drop her!

280
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,819
Turn the wheel! The wheel! Turn it.

281
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,950
That!

282
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,619
- Come on, push it!
- I am!

283
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,038
Hurry! Push it hard!

284
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,166
Push it hard!

285
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,251
OK, OK!

286
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:12,754
Now pull it! Pull it! Go! Go!

287
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,715
Pull it!

288
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,354
- Enola, jump.
- (Bullets hit hull)

289
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,900
- Just look at me! Jump!
- OK!

290
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,376
Well, excuse me!

291
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:55,505
Did I say anybody could leave
before the battle was over? Did I?

292
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:59,009
- No!
- Well, do something! I hate sails.

293
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:09,811
Hey!

294
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:13,649
- Can you steer?
- Can I trust you?

295
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,104
Answer me this, somebody.
Why is that boat still firing?

296
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,357
- What's that cousin's name?
- Chuck.

297
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,652
- Hey, Chuck!
- He's pulling him right into us!

298
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,115
Maybe he doesn't answer to Chuck.
Call him Charles. Charles!

299
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:09,288
- Stop him! Stop him!
- (Machine gun roars)

300
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,794
(Men cry out)

301
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:17,838
Charles!

302
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,843
Adios, cousins.

303
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,640
She's here somewhere. Keep looking.

304
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:15,062
(Woman) Put me down! Put me down!

305
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,155
- What you got?
- A couple of heartbeats.

306
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,282
Aren't saying much.

307
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:32,788
If you notice the arterial nature
of the blood from the hole in my head,

308
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:36,875
you can assume we're all having
a real lousy day.

309
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,004
So here it is. I need to know
about that tattooed girl.

310
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:47,052
- First one that tells me lives.
- I saw a girl! I saw her!

311
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,179
She had a big tattoo on her.

312
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,847
She was...

313
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,683
You won. Start over.

314
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,895
I-I saw a girl. I'm not sure,

315
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,732
but I think she got on that boat
with three hulls.

316
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:04,778
The boat that cost me a thousand Gs
of go-juice?

317
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,322
- The Muto's boat.
- Muto?

318
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,283
Yeah, he's got these slits here,

319
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,787
like...like fish gills.

320
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,123
He wasn't really a man.

321
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,875
A fluke of evolution!

322
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,796
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of...

323
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,257
- Evolution.
- I know!

324
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:30,971
- No! You said you wouldn't kill me!
- Did I say that? Witnesses? Anybody?

325
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,558
- Yes, yes, yes, you did.
- Ah, I may have!

326
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,812
I may have.

327
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,314
Aaaah!

328
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,696
We get to the 'Dez,

329
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,826
take up that sky boat,
send it out on patrol.

330
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:58,790
We got to keep an eye out
for that ichthy freak!

331
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:25,025
You've been there, haven't you?

332
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,363
Dryland?

333
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,492
You know where it is.

334
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:38,413
- Yeah, I know where it is.
- Oh...

335
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,291
And...

336
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,170
- And we're going?
- You and I are.

337
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:50,050
The kid we've got to pitch over the side.

338
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,472
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

339
00:41:56,723 --> 00:42:01,728
I'm taking on water. I'll be lucky to get
half a hydro ration out of that.

340
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,315
You know, I said I won't drink.

341
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,984
For 12 days?

342
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:15,700
No. It's better one of you dies now
than both of you die slow.

343
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,619
Wait, wait.

344
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,455
We saved your life. We got you out.

345
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,584
No, you got me out so you could get out.
We're even.

346
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,920
She can cook. She can fish.

347
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,047
- So can I.
- Take my necklace.

348
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,467
- I got better ones below.
- No, look! Oh.

349
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,847
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

350
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,767
I can understand why you would want to.

351
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,811
But she's a child.

352
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,523
(Humming)

353
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:56,283
Is there something else, then?

354
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,291
Enola, go below.

355
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:06,876
Enola.

356
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,014
Yeah.

357
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,057
You said so yourself.

358
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,603
Been out there a long time.

359
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,861
A couple of hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

360
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,864
- We're not like that.
- You all are.

361
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:25,914
Know what I was really thinking?

362
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,668
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

363
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,754
You got nothing I need.

364
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:52,273
You're taking us to Dryland.

365
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:58,947
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

366
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:02,909
- Believe me, I'm not the one to start on.
- Both of us!

367
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:12,127
- How long do you plan to hold that on me?
- As long as it takes.

368
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:16,840
OK.

369
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,258
Ah!

370
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,554
Let me out! Let me out of here!

371
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:27,267
You coward! Don't you touch my child!

372
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,561
Come here! I...

373
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,564
(She grunts)

374
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,152
Oh...

375
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,567
OK.

376
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,861
Now don't move, OK?

377
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,490
There. Oh, looking real good, yeah.

378
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,783
There.

379
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,619
There. All done.

380
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:31,664
Now there may be some small problem
in depth perception.

381
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:35,376
It better not screw up my short game.

382
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,670
Well?

383
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:41,090
- (Woman) Looks good.
- It's better than your real eye.

384
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:45,053
- Much better.
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.

385
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:49,390
- Looks like shit.
- That's why I love children. No guile.

386
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,729
It does look like shit!

387
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,943
- And it feels like cold shit!
- Deacon?

388
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:03,696
- What...?
- I'm sorry.

389
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:08,409
It's just there's a problem in the pit.
Maybe you should come.

390
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,624
Let's drive.

391
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,927
To the pit.
Don't bother with the scenic route.

392
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,428
Drive!

393
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,266
(Deacon) Hey, it's driving better.

394
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,896
(âª "Peter Gunn Theme")

395
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,110
(Rowdy yelling)

396
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,529
Get off!

397
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,032
Get off! Get out the way!

398
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:52,120
- Get out the way!
- All right, all right. OK, OK.

399
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:58,376
Bless you, cousins.
Bless all you cousins over there.

400
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:02,422
Keep up the good work!
Growth is progress, growth is progress.

401
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,257
(Man) Somebody!

402
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,759
Hey, up there!

403
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:10,054
Take it off!

404
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,642
- Yes?
- Your Deaconship.

405
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,144
Hello!

406
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:20,565
Good morning. Or night.
Whichever the case may be.

407
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,359
What is it? I'm a busy man.

408
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:27,238
I thought you should know
you're down to exactly

409
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,326
four feet nine inches of black stuff.

410
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:39,000
- Thank you, sir.
- How many Gs after refining?

411
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:43,129
- Maybe three refuelers.
- We'll burn through that in two lunars.

412
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,090
Sweet Joe! What's happening to this place?

413
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:51,012
- We outgrowed it.
- All right.

414
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:54,557
The only thing that is important
is the tattooed girl.

415
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,393
We don't spare any go-juice finding her.

416
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:02,106
We don't waste it anywhere else. Cancel
all those tractor pulls and all that stuff

417
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,734
until later. You got it?

418
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,863
Dryland is the mother lode.

419
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,115
Ha-ha! On your toes.

420
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,202
Excellent.

421
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,359
- Hi.
- Move.

422
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,821
(Helen) Enola! Enola, come here!

423
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,491
Come on!

424
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,121
Enola, come over here.

425
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,219
Hey!

426
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:20,351
- What are you doing?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

427
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:27,025
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

428
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,069
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

429
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:34,198
- I drew it for you.
- Don't draw on anything! Understand?

430
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:40,246
What?

431
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,252
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

432
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,589
You take up space
and you're slowing me down.

433
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:57,138
You know, she's just a little girl.
She doesn't know your rules.

434
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,058
You wanna stay? You teach her.

435
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,747
Enola, what did I tell you?

436
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,129
You're not so tough, you know that?

437
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,511
How many people have you killed?

438
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,766
Ten? Twenty?

439
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,937
You talk a lot.

440
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:48,523
I talk a lot cos you don't talk at all.

441
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:50,566
So how many?

442
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:57,323
- Including little girls?
- I'm not afraid of you.

443
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:04,038
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly
if you cut your hair.

444
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:11,045
In fact, you talk all the time!
It's like a storm when you're around!

445
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,923
(Helen) Enola! Hey, what are you doing?

446
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:17,635
- Helen!
- You bastard! She can't swim!

447
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,638
(Enola) Help me! Helen!

448
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,015
Helen, help me!

449
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,144
Help!

450
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:28,813
Helen, help me!

451
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,323
Helen! Help!

452
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,242
Hold on.

453
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,078
Look at me, look at me.

454
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,749
Oh... Wait. Come on.

455
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,168
Please!

456
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:51,294
Please!

457
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:53,212
Oh, please!

458
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,298
(Helen coughs)

459
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,178
Hey!

460
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,433
Hold on. OK... Almost.

461
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,476
(Gasping)

462
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,236
(Enola gasps)

463
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:23,659
Thanks. But I swear,
if you ever touch her again,

464
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:28,789
you sonofabitch... Look at me! You'll go
to bed that night and never wake up.

465
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,000
- Shut up.
- What?

466
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,003
- (Helen) Smokers?
- Yeah.

467
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,088
Well, can't we outrun them?

468
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:40,384
- (Plane engine hums)
- Not with my sail down.

469
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:02,365
- What are you thinking about?
- That's a nice touch.

470
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,283
That's them!

471
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:13,000
Don't hit the kid!

472
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,382
(Laughing)

473
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:29,892
Hey!

474
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,191
Coward!

475
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,157
(Laughs)

476
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,368
- (Gun jams)
- Fuck!

477
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:17,857
No!

478
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:23,237
Hey! Urgh!

479
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:31,454
Joe?

480
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,796
Cut it!

481
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,640
Come on! Come on!

482
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:13,871
(Mast creaking)

483
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,967
Come on!

484
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,823
(Helen) Oh...I'm really sorry.

485
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,160
I'm sorry! You didn't give me much choice.

486
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,122
I know. But you ran away.

487
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,124
I... What?

488
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:43,085
What are you do...? No! Please, no!

489
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,217
(Grunting)

490
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:57,516
Don't ever touch anything
on my boat again.

491
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,147
She said she was sorry!

492
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,403
That means you're supposed to
say something back!

493
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:35,095
- Did you say something?
- (Enola) Mm-mm.

494
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,579
(Deacon) The child.
Did he have the girl with him?

495
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,541
- Uh-huh.
- Seems to me if we launch now,

496
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,252
we can cut him down just about here.

497
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:09,964
- If he doesn't change course.
- That's not likely.

498
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:13,050
He's a wily one, that ichthy demon.

499
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,762
If he knows he's been spotted,

500
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:20,307
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

501
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:24,228
which is exactly why
he'll keep his heading.

502
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:27,439
The important question is
where's he heading?

503
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:31,110
Does he know
how precious his cargo is?

504
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:35,281
I say that he's headed here
and we take him here.

505
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,457
(Drifter calls out)

506
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:48,919
- Drifter?
- Mm-hm.

507
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,838
Are we going to stop?

508
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,923
- (Drifter) Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

509
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,676
I thought you all stopped for each other.

510
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:04,101
Maybe he has some FOOD!

511
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:08,188
Don't find many who follow the rules
any more.

512
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:12,067
Make it quick. What's your business?

513
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,241
Trade.

514
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:23,037
Got any resin?

515
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:29,627
Resin? He's out of his mind.
He's out of his mind completely. Resin?

516
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:33,380
You've been outwater a long time,
haven't you?

517
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,468
Don't be joking me, man! Resin!
You don't got enough.

518
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:40,804
- How about food?
- Could you say that again, please?

519
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:43,807
- How about food?
- Well, yeah, food.

520
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,893
That'd be good, eh?

521
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:49,438
I haven't eaten in, well, you know,
forever.

522
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:55,444
Which one of you two is the cook, then?
I usually fall for the waitress.

523
01:00:57,071 --> 01:01:00,658
- Like you said, I don't have much.
- I'll decide.

524
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:05,204
Look at you. We could start
with that wee orchard over there.

525
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,331
Woo!

526
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,584
(Mariner) All right. Hold it there.

527
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,712
- We can talk.
- Fair enough.

528
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,715
(Muttering)

529
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:23,472
It's a nice rod, isn't it?
I like that rod. It's a nice rod.

530
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,099
My favorite.

531
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:34,233
Got yourself a wee harem going here,
don't you now?

532
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:44,410
- What do you want for the women?
- We're not for sale.

533
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:48,414
Not for sale? I mean, there's
no such thing as not for sale.

534
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:50,499
Not for sale, not for sale. Aye.

535
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:56,004
Are they a pair
or would you sell them separate?

536
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,217
Our business is done here, unless
you've got some resin you can part with.

537
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:04,638
I told you once already, I don't have any.
I don't have it, don't have it.

538
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:09,143
Haven't seen any for trade in lunars now.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

539
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:15,858
I do have something
that'll make you change your mind.

540
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:18,193
Something you can't pass on.

541
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:22,823
I took it off an atoller refugee camp.

542
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,952
Life savings of the entire clan.

543
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,920
Paper! Look at my wee paper.

544
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:43,177
Paper! Have you ever seen paper?
Look at it, smell it.

545
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:48,390
I'm saving it for a special trade.

546
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,395
Don't you do it.

547
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:58,484
Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person.
Whose boat is this anyway?

548
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:03,197
- Is it your boat or your boat?
- It's his boat, but he doesn't own us.

549
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:14,500
- Half an hour.
- He's obviously out of his mind.

550
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:17,461
I've got two pages in here, man!

551
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:21,173
- I'd get half a dozen girls with this.
- Half an hour.

552
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:24,635
- You trading or not?
- Don't!

553
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,762
Shut up.

554
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:28,931
OK.

555
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:35,813
45 minutes with the wee one. I like to do
the talkin', if you know what I mean.

556
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,525
No!

557
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,319
Fair enough.

558
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,530
Come, come, come, come, come.

559
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,949
No. My boat.

560
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,036
That's fair enough.
Good, good, good, good, good.

561
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,287
Helen...

562
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:55,999
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

563
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,089
It's been a while for me now.

564
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:48,969
Guess it's been more than a while,
actually, but...

565
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,473
I've only got half an hour.

566
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,561
Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour,
half an hour, half an hour.

567
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,730
OK, right, right, right.

568
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:05,110
You're so beautiful.
Anyone ever told you that?

569
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:08,906
Give me that! What are you doing?
It's just a game!

570
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,992
Oh, I...

571
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,202
I... We was just playing.

572
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:19,374
Trade's off.

573
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,335
I changed my mind.

574
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,337
Well, um...

575
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:27,925
Well, you can't do that.
I mean, a deal's a deal. Aye.

576
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,260
I just did.

577
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,766
She's mine, aye. No, no, no.
I won't have it.

578
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,601
- No.
- Go on.

579
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:41,438
Go, go, go, good. Aye, aye.
Don't go too far now!

580
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,399
This won't take but a minute.

581
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,572
I hate this boat.

582
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,450
I...hate...this...boat!

583
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,578
You bastard!

584
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,584
You...

585
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:07,965
You're pretty stingy for a man
who's got everything, aren't you?

586
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,061
Aargh!

587
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:23,188
(Crashing and yelling)

588
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,315
(Drifter) Ya bastard!

589
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,620
Where's me boat?

590
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,623
Where's me boat?

591
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,835
(Mutters to himself)

592
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:51,383
Help me to the boat.

593
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:55,137
Ah! The boat...

594
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:30,005
Wait... No!

595
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:35,052
You'll never catch anything with this.
It's useless.

596
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,601
(Helen) Look, I'm sorry!

597
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:45,270
You were right about the pole.

598
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,272
You were right!

599
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,399
But we have to eat.

600
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,323
I know you can hear me!

601
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:59,951
We can fish for ourselves.
Just show us what to do.

602
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:03,997
- You must know. Even you've got to eat!
- You just sit there.

603
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:29,689
What...?

604
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,638
(Muffled explosion)

605
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,354
Happy now?

606
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,819
(Enola cheerily hums)

607
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,416
You don't like my singing, do you?

608
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:37,424
Helen says you don't like my singing
cos you can't sing.

609
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:44,931
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

610
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,227
The sound of the world.

611
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,069
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud.

612
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:01,364
And moving around all the time.
Try sitting still.

613
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,285
Eyeball?

614
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,718
I wish I had feet like his.

615
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:28,433
- Then maybe I could swim.
- Enola...

616
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,064
(Belches) Sorry.

617
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:42,239
I never met a person
who couldn't swim before.

618
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,450
I can't.

619
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,538
People said I was weird.

620
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,624
Maybe they're right.

621
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,713
Maybe they were right about you, too.

622
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:28,326
Enola wanted to give you this.

623
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:35,125
And this.

624
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,754
She won't take it again.

625
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:48,013
You don't look much like her.

626
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:51,308
I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.

627
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:52,976
You act like it.

628
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:59,899
- What are those marks on her back?
- Nothing.

629
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:03,945
- They're just fanciful things.
- Like what she draws?

630
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:08,366
She draws what she sees.
She's like a mirror.

631
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,454
People on the atoll thought she was a...

632
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,874
Freak?

633
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:21,171
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I just thought she was special.

634
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:32,682
I'm not giving it to her. It's just...

635
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,517
A loan.

636
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,562
Yeah. I'm not giving it to her.

637
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,570
Is Dryland beautiful?

638
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,491
You'll see.

639
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,303
(Enola giggles)

640
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:17,435
Enola?

641
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,647
Enola! What are you doing?

642
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:24,234
- Those monsters will kill her!
- They're asleep now.

643
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,322
Hands around my neck.

644
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:36,162
Let the water tell your arms and legs
how to move. Going down. Hold your breath.

645
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,681
- What is it?
- What is it?

646
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:22,477
Barter outpost.

647
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:28,107
- You said we'd get to Dryland today.
- Today, tomorrow. What does it matter?

648
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:31,694
We need resin.

649
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,281
(Speaks PortuGreek)

650
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:44,082
- What is that?
- It's PortuGreek.

651
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,044
Their own language.

652
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,756
That's what I thought.

653
01:16:18,783 --> 01:16:20,326
Ah.

654
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,704
There's my girl.

655
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:24,122
Yes.

656
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:27,834
Howdy, darling.
Come on in here now.

657
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:59,866
- What's going on?
- Smokers.

658
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,079
What the hell...?

659
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,460
He's spotted us!

660
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:13,338
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!

661
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:15,506
Sound it! Sound it!

662
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:29,145
Woo-hoo!

663
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,613
Enola!

664
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:53,544
Starboard side! Now!

665
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,547
Get in the chair!

666
01:18:02,929 --> 01:18:05,765
Watch it! He's clearing the net!

667
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:19,320
Go to the helm!

668
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,616
- Get the centerboard!
- Centerboard?

669
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,327
What centerboard? I don't know what to do!

670
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:31,332
It's too late! Over here.

671
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:45,471
Aaah!

672
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,561
No!

673
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,538
Give me that rifle.

674
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:15,209
Boy, if you want to do something right,
you've got to do it yourself.

675
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,212
All right.

676
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:20,840
Ugh!

677
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,387
I winged him.

678
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:30,349
Load all the go-juice onto one boat
and run the freak down.

679
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:33,561
You can't catch him with ten boats
and you want to send just one?

680
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,272
Well, I pray that you're joking.

681
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,115
Bring me the Trackers.

682
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,624
He's hurt.

683
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,668
It's not what you think.
They weren't after her.

684
01:19:57,794 --> 01:20:00,087
- I saw what I saw.
- What?

685
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,426
No more lies.

686
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:10,139
- Ah!
- What are the marks on her back?

687
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:14,143
People say it's the way to Dryland.

688
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,521
- Dryland's a myth!
- No!

689
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:20,608
You said so yourself that you know
where it is. You did.

690
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:29,033
You're a fool to believe in something
you've never seen before.

691
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:33,538
I've seen it. I've touched it. Dirt
that was richer and darker than yours.

692
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:35,498
In the basket we found Enola in!

693
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:38,459
- It doesn't exist!
- How can you be so sure?

694
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:43,005
I've sailed farther than most have
dreamed. And I've never seen it.

695
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:49,470
- But the things on your boat.
- Things on my boat? What?

696
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:53,724
There are things on your boat
that nobody has ever seen!

697
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,852
What are these shells?

698
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:58,563
And that reflecting glass?

699
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:01,732
And...and...and the music box.

700
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:07,363
If not from Dryland, then where? Where?

701
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:11,784
You want to see Dryland?

702
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:15,872
You really want to see it?

703
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,584
I'll take you to Dryland.

704
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,843
Get in.

705
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:37,977
- Well, what about Enola?
- There's only air for one.

706
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:40,897
- Get in the water.
- It'll be all right.

707
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,154
Don't touch anything.

708
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:54,035
OK?

709
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:27,456
I didn't know.

710
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,460
All this time?

711
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,923
- I didn't know.
- Nobody does.

712
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:49,728
- Can you get us out of here?
- I'd say there's two chances of that.

713
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:52,773
- Hey!
- No way and no how.

714
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:56,277
Should have bought me that drink.
Come on!

715
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,279
This way. Come on!

716
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,615
(Celebratory whooping)

717
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,367
(Man) Yeah!

718
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:09,582
Proper introductions first.
I'm the Deacon.

719
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,960
(Laughing)

720
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:20,092
If you don't recall the face, perhaps
it's cos I didn't always look like this.

721
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:26,849
Now, I suspect
she's somewhere real close.

722
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,019
So we could tear this boat apart,

723
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:33,063
but I'd rather somebody just tell me
where she is.

724
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,524
The first one that does that lives.

725
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:40,154
And the runner-up...
Well, actually, there are no runners-up.

726
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:45,409
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.

727
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,537
Choose 'em. One, two. Live or die.

728
01:26:49,914 --> 01:26:51,916
You know, personally,

729
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:56,712
I'd rather shoot
the sperm of the devil here. Huh?

730
01:26:56,837 --> 01:26:58,839
But you know something?

731
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:03,886
I don't think you're going to tell me,
are you? Huh? Too bad.

732
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:06,680
Come on. Eh?

733
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,850
What do you say? She's not your kind.

734
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:13,520
You don't even have a kind.

735
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:15,648
If you say it,

736
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:18,234
he'll still kill us both.

737
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,074
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

738
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,494
If you don't tell me,

739
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:32,039
I swear to Poseidon
that we'll torch your boat.

740
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:41,674
Refresh my memory -
what if neither one of them talks?

741
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:44,843
- Never happened before.
- Never happened before.

742
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:50,599
All right! If they won't tell us
where she is, do 'em! Both of them!

743
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,935
- Just kill 'em now!
- No!

744
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:57,398
So gullible! Ha-ha! Bring her here.

745
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:02,361
- (Smokers cheer)
- Seek and ye shall receive!

746
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:06,490
So ends your daily sermonette!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

747
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:11,287
Now figure out this map. Turn her upside
down. Does that mean anything to you?

748
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:12,788
No.

749
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:18,085
All right. We'll figure it out
back at the 'Dez, boys. Careful with her.

750
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:22,464
- What about them?
- Do 'em both. Torch the boat.

751
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,883
Aargh!

752
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:28,762
We have to go under!

753
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:33,183
No! I can't breathe like you!

754
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:35,602
I'll breathe for both of us.

755
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:01,503
Woo!

756
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,218
(Enola) Helen, help!

757
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:10,095
Helen!

758
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,972
Helen!

759
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:44,588
My boat.

760
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,016
Enola...

761
01:29:58,394 --> 01:30:01,939
What is this? Get those chains off her!

762
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:04,274
What are we, barbarians here?

763
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:07,319
Goodness gracious. Snakes alive.

764
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:10,406
Come on, out of here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

765
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:13,742
Rub-a-dub-dub. (Chuckles)

766
01:30:15,536 --> 01:30:19,039
You want to come over here
and sit on my lap?

767
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,165
No?

768
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,503
How about a cigarette?

769
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:30,426
Nothing like a good smoke if you miss
your mom. Never too young to start.

770
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:32,803
No.

771
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:35,431
Well, I got something right here
I know you'd like.

772
01:30:36,849 --> 01:30:40,060
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

773
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:45,482
Now they're yours,

774
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:50,279
if you help me
with just one problem. All right?

775
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:56,452
Now... Now that tattoo on your back.

776
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:00,622
I've been told that that...

777
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:04,251
that's actually a map?

778
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:07,629
It's the way to Dryland.

779
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,882
Now we're getting someplace.

780
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:15,179
Could you teach me how to read that?

781
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,974
Setback.

782
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:26,356
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

783
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:31,487
You know, like your mommy
or your pet fish? He say anything?

784
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:34,072
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

785
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:39,119
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like!
He took out my eye!

786
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:42,414
And if I ever see him again,
I'm gonna cut open his head

787
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:47,169
and I'm gonna eat his brain!
You think he'd like that?

788
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:51,673
You can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

789
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:54,635
But he's not here.

790
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,637
And he ain't coming.

791
01:31:56,762 --> 01:31:58,847
And no one's gonna save you.

792
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:02,184
He'll come for me. He will.

793
01:32:02,309 --> 01:32:04,478
Well, you better tell me
what I wanna know

794
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:09,358
or he can save what's left of you
in a goddamn jar!

795
01:32:18,325 --> 01:32:20,702
We're going to die here, aren't we?

796
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:43,058
Aren't we?

797
01:32:52,401 --> 01:32:54,278
After the atoll,

798
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:56,947
when I offered myself to you,

799
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:02,035
why didn't you take me?

800
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:06,790
Cos you didn't really want me.

801
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:10,502
Not really.

802
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,329
Have I been sleeping?

803
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:17,129
I was dreaming.

804
01:35:20,132 --> 01:35:21,883
It's funny.

805
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:25,303
I always thought Dryland floated.

806
01:35:25,429 --> 01:35:29,307
Or drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

807
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:31,768
Why did you believe in it so much?

808
01:35:32,978 --> 01:35:35,355
Cos we weren't made for the sea.

809
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,693
We've got our hands and our feet.

810
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:42,154
We're supposed to walk.

811
01:35:45,866 --> 01:35:47,826
I miss her sound.

812
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:52,581
Don't you?

813
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,419
(Gregor) Helen!

814
01:35:57,544 --> 01:36:00,839
No, no, no, no! Helen, up! Above you!

815
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:03,467
(Helen) Gregor!

816
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,595
(Gregor laughs)

817
01:36:07,846 --> 01:36:10,557
Smart thinking to burn your boat!

818
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:14,478
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

819
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:19,191
Who's that with you?
Ichthys sapien! Is that really you?

820
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:24,321
I'll throw the rope down.
You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

821
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:27,616
Helen!

822
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:31,995
- Where's Enola?
- Smokers took her.

823
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:35,290
They'd have me, too,
if it weren't for him.

824
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:36,792
My friend,

825
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:39,753
thank you. Very human of you.

826
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:43,381
Grab your things quickly. Quickly.

827
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:44,508
Come.

828
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:54,434
You see? Right down there.

829
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:58,355
There's several other survivors.
We'll just start over again.

830
01:36:59,356 --> 01:37:01,566
(Man) You can't ask us to go and get her.

831
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:04,694
(Woman) Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble. Forget it!

832
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:08,532
(Helen) They need to find Dryland
just like we do.

833
01:37:08,657 --> 01:37:09,825
Of course.

834
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:13,954
(Helen) If the Mariner's willing to go
after her, then why not us?

835
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:16,748
(Woman) We don't want you here!
You or the girl!

836
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:19,459
Helen...

837
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:22,504
The papers the Mariner brought you.

838
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:26,508
It's the same language
the tattoo is written in.

839
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:30,178
- There are numbers.
- (Man) You're as crazy as she is!

840
01:37:30,303 --> 01:37:34,724
We're wasting valuable time. More Smokers
will come. We need to be moving now.

841
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:39,771
- We need this child to find Dryland!
- I'm not going.

842
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,232
- (Man) Nobody is.
- (Woman) They're on the horizon!

843
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:46,069
- Know what that is yet?
- The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

844
01:37:46,194 --> 01:37:50,115
It seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location.

845
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,702
Latitude, longitude.
It doesn't make sense, though.

846
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:56,496
The numbers,
they seem to be backwards or something.

847
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:59,833
- It's upside down.
- The world?

848
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:04,004
- The poles have reversed themselves?
- I've been mapping the cities below.

849
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:10,051
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

850
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:12,929
- (Man) That's blasphemy!
- No, it's true.

851
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:16,474
I've seen it with my own eyes.
There's land.

852
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:20,312
- Right under our keel. None of it's dry.
- Some is.

853
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:24,482
Enola's been there. I know that now.

854
01:38:24,608 --> 01:38:28,820
- I saw what she drew.
- That's why he's going after Enola!

855
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:33,033
- To find Dryland.
- I don't care about Dryland.

856
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:37,287
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

857
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:41,416
- (Man) I say let him go.
- (Woman) We're better off without them!

858
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:46,087
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

859
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:51,635
(Woman) Forget about the Muto, Helen!
If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

860
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,388
We've got to go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.

861
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:59,601
Don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

862
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:10,153
- You got that tattoo figured out yet?
- It'd be easier if it was flat.

863
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:12,864
Big and flat. It needs to be flat.

864
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:17,202
- What have you got in mind?
- Well, you cut it off her back,

865
01:39:17,327 --> 01:39:19,871
stretch it, mount it,
give us a proper look.

866
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,207
(Deacon)
Take her down below until I holler.

867
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,918
Saint Joe, we're close.

868
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:28,713
After centuries of shame.

869
01:40:16,011 --> 01:40:18,054
(Distant echoing voices)

870
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,672
(Laughter and yelling)

871
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:03,099
- They're getting ugly.
- Don't I know it.

872
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,727
Announce me, cousin.

873
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:12,901
- Hey, here he is.
- (Crowd roars)

874
01:41:13,026 --> 01:41:16,613
Rise up, brothers and sisters,

875
01:41:18,073 --> 01:41:20,075
turn your eyes

876
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,870
and open your hearts
to your humble benefactor,

877
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:27,582
your spiritual shepherd
and dictator for life,

878
01:41:27,707 --> 01:41:30,335
the Deacon of the 'Dez!

879
01:41:30,794 --> 01:41:32,879
(Crowd roars)

880
01:42:05,495 --> 01:42:07,288
(Deacon) Children,

881
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:09,833
children of the provider,

882
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:15,547
citizens of the good ship,
please now, hear me speak.

883
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,262
- I've had a vision.
- (Man) We're tired of your visions!

884
01:42:22,387 --> 01:42:24,681
What about the land you promised us?

885
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:26,516
(Crowd cheers)

886
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:28,601
- Yeah!
- (Deacon) Oh, ye of little faith.

887
01:42:29,978 --> 01:42:32,147
I've had a vision so great,

888
01:42:32,272 --> 01:42:35,150
that as it came to me, I wept.

889
01:42:35,275 --> 01:42:40,822
- And in this splenditudinous...
- (Smoker) Is that Bone's vehicle?

890
01:42:40,947 --> 01:42:45,118
(Deacon) I saw - and you know
what it is that I saw.

891
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:47,620
I saw...

892
01:42:48,872 --> 01:42:51,291
- the land.
- (Cheering)

893
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,534
- Horse, is that you?
- (Jet ski engine revs)

894
01:43:29,412 --> 01:43:33,082
Look, just bring it in slow, OK?
I don't have all day.

895
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:34,792
(Engine revs)

896
01:43:34,918 --> 01:43:36,377
Horse!

897
01:43:36,502 --> 01:43:39,380
Just bring it up slow.

898
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,841
I said slow!

899
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:51,601
You shouldn't be doing that.
You're going to get in trouble.

900
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,645
Huh! That's right.

901
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:58,149
You're not afraid. You've got
your pet freak coming to rescue you.

902
01:43:58,274 --> 01:44:00,735
He's not a freak
and he can take you any time!

903
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:07,116
He's killed dozens of people.
He doesn't have any mercy or anything.

904
01:44:07,242 --> 01:44:09,202
He even kills little girls.

905
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,664
Haven't we all?

906
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:15,708
Shit!

907
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:18,002
It's Horse.

908
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:22,840
Find him! Find him!

909
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:27,178
Yes! Yes! Yes!

910
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:30,932
- Come on.
- Getting nervous, aren't you?

911
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:36,896
I don't get nervous.

912
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:41,192
(Deacon)
And if there's a river, we'll dam it!

913
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:44,988
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it!

914
01:44:45,989 --> 01:44:48,658
Cos I'm talkin' progress here!

915
01:44:48,783 --> 01:44:50,159
Yes, sir!

916
01:44:50,285 --> 01:44:53,288
- I'm talkin' development!
- Yeah!

917
01:44:53,413 --> 01:44:57,792
We shall suck and savor
the sweet flavor

918
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:00,461
of Dryland.

919
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:02,422
(Enola) Your face is all red.

920
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:08,636
Helen said anybody that has a face
that red has either had too much sun

921
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:11,973
- or too much to drink.
- All right, that's it.

922
01:45:12,098 --> 01:45:15,018
- I'm gonna burn your face!
- All right.

923
01:45:15,143 --> 01:45:19,147
- What's up?
- We're just talking about her friend.

924
01:45:20,565 --> 01:45:23,359
- What's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

925
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:27,864
- So Death can't find him.
- (Mocking noises)

926
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:34,412
He doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

927
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:38,207
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

928
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:41,294
He's fast and strong like a big wind.

929
01:45:42,295 --> 01:45:46,090
He can hear 100 miles
and see 100 miles underwater.

930
01:45:46,215 --> 01:45:49,218
He can hide in the shadow
of a noon sun.

931
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:53,556
He could be right behind you and you won't
even know it till you're dead!

932
01:45:55,767 --> 01:45:57,643
Give it a rest.

933
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:02,440
- He'll come for me. He will.
- Yeah?

934
01:46:03,775 --> 01:46:05,735
Well, I hope he does.

935
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,656
Remember you said that.

936
01:46:12,075 --> 01:46:14,535
(Deacon) Look at us.

937
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,871
Look at us here today.

938
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:20,541
Dryland is not just our destination,

939
01:46:21,376 --> 01:46:24,337
but it is our destiny!

940
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:27,632
(Speech continues)

941
01:46:32,595 --> 01:46:34,972
Find him! Find him!

942
01:46:35,098 --> 01:46:39,435
How can I find this glorious place?

943
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:42,563
And he said to me,

944
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,400
"A child

945
01:46:45,525 --> 01:46:48,027
"shall lead you."

946
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:50,822
A child.

947
01:46:50,947 --> 01:46:53,282
- And behold...
- It's time.

948
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:56,494
The instrument of our salvation!

949
01:46:58,413 --> 01:47:00,331
(Crowd roars)

950
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:06,379
Our guide in the wild!

951
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:08,840
Our beacon in the darkness!

952
01:47:08,965 --> 01:47:11,134
Turn her around, Nord.

953
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:13,719
She has shown me the path!

954
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:21,644
And before the holy-most moment
is upon us,

955
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:25,189
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe!

956
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:31,988
And let's get this tub of shit
up to speed!

957
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:33,948
(Chaotic yelling)

958
01:47:37,869 --> 01:47:38,995
Yep.

959
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:19,494
Stroke!

960
01:48:22,497 --> 01:48:23,664
Stroke!

961
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:29,003
Stroke!

962
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,133
(Galley master) Stroke!

963
01:48:35,927 --> 01:48:37,512
Stroke!

964
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:48,648
- So which way are we rowing?
- I don't have a goddamn clue!

965
01:48:48,773 --> 01:48:53,277
Don't worry. They'll row for a month
before they figure out I'm faking it.

966
01:48:53,402 --> 01:48:57,406
- But, um... Why?
- Oh, you want details?

967
01:48:57,532 --> 01:49:01,702
Well, I'm not telling these savages
we haven't solved the map yet.

968
01:49:01,827 --> 01:49:06,916
I promised results and I'll get 'em if I
gotta cut 'em out of her goddamn back!

969
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:11,754
Who is that? Who is that?

970
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,299
(Man) Maybe one of the spare rowers?

971
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:25,977
Why aren't you rowing?

972
01:49:34,569 --> 01:49:36,946
- It's him!
- It is him.

973
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:40,908
You guys are in so much trouble.

974
01:49:43,578 --> 01:49:47,039
Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.

975
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,959
He's like a turd that won't flush.

976
01:49:51,168 --> 01:49:53,045
I want the girl.

977
01:49:57,216 --> 01:50:01,637
You know,
I thought you were stupid, friend.

978
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:05,266
But I underestimated you.

979
01:50:05,391 --> 01:50:08,394
You are a total, freakin' retard!

980
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:10,438
(Deacon cackles)

981
01:50:11,606 --> 01:50:14,650
I want the girl. That's all.

982
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:18,487
What on this screwed-up earth
makes you think you're going to get her?

983
01:50:27,872 --> 01:50:29,874
You know what this is?

984
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:36,505
I drop it, you burn.

985
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:38,799
We all burn.

986
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:40,885
No, wait, wait, wait.

987
01:50:41,636 --> 01:50:44,221
Let's not do anything rash here.

988
01:50:44,347 --> 01:50:47,683
I mean, are you sure she's worth all this?

989
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:51,145
She never does stop talking.
She never shuts up.

990
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:53,314
- I noticed.
- What is it, then?

991
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:55,733
Huh? It's the map.

992
01:50:56,734 --> 01:50:58,402
She's my friend.

993
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:03,324
Golly gee.
A single tear rolls down my cheek.

994
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:06,035
You're gonna die for your friend.

995
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:09,205
If it comes to that.

996
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:13,167
He's bluffing! I'll kill him.

997
01:51:13,292 --> 01:51:17,171
- He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.
- Shut up!

998
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:22,343
You know, I don't think you're going to
drop that torch, my friend.

999
01:51:23,344 --> 01:51:27,139
- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

1000
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,728
No!

1001
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:42,571
Oh, thank God.

1002
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:48,744
Aargh!

1003
01:51:55,251 --> 01:51:57,253
(Heavy gunfire)

1004
01:52:00,423 --> 01:52:02,633
(Man) Look out!

1005
01:52:02,758 --> 01:52:05,219
Get him!

1006
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:07,555
Let's go, goddamn it!

1007
01:52:08,848 --> 01:52:10,266
(Man screams)

1008
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:13,644
Don't just stand there - kill something!

1009
01:52:16,647 --> 01:52:18,733
Was this your big vision?

1010
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,366
Aaargh!

1011
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:28,951
Ah!

1012
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:31,370
I've always wanted to drive this monster!

1013
01:52:33,748 --> 01:52:36,584
(Man) There he is! There he is!

1014
01:52:40,963 --> 01:52:42,715
That's him there!

1015
01:52:45,551 --> 01:52:46,552
Aargh!

1016
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:52,266
Aaaargh!

1017
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:58,230
(Enola) Let me go!

1018
01:52:58,355 --> 01:53:00,357
Let go!

1019
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:07,615
(Explosion)

1020
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:10,868
Let me go!

1021
01:53:15,206 --> 01:53:17,833
(Enola) Let me go! Let go!

1022
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:19,627
Let me go!

1023
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:23,255
Let go! Let go!

1024
01:53:26,759 --> 01:53:29,929
(Laughs)
You should have stayed on the water.

1025
01:53:30,054 --> 01:53:31,847
(Clicks)

1026
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:42,983
You know how to fly an airplane?
You're lucky I do.

1027
01:53:43,108 --> 01:53:46,821
Ow! Now you stop it!
You behave yourself now!

1028
01:54:41,917 --> 01:54:43,043
Up!

1029
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:14,533
(Explosion)

1030
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:22,750
It's going down. It's sinking!

1031
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:27,463
- Gregor, bring us right down on top.
- Hurry, Gregor!

1032
01:55:27,588 --> 01:55:29,715
- (Gregor) Don't worry!
- Hurry.

1033
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36,639
(Hull creaks)

1034
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:46,649
Enola! Up here! Grab on!

1035
01:55:52,947 --> 01:55:54,740
Are they on yet?

1036
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:00,913
- What is it?
- I don't know!

1037
01:56:01,997 --> 01:56:03,916
No!

1038
01:56:12,925 --> 01:56:17,471
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip
your cute little lungs out!

1039
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:23,102
Aaaah!

1040
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,190
Aaargh!

1041
01:56:31,777 --> 01:56:34,279
Pull! Almost!

1042
01:56:39,034 --> 01:56:41,036
(Gregor laughs)

1043
01:56:42,162 --> 01:56:43,789
(Explosion)

1044
01:57:13,402 --> 01:57:14,403
No!

1045
01:57:14,528 --> 01:57:17,072
- Aaaaargh!
- No! Enola!

1046
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:21,869
Saint Joe! Hole in one.

1047
01:57:21,994 --> 01:57:24,788
- Helen!
- Enola!

1048
01:57:24,913 --> 01:57:26,957
- (Gregor) Helen!
- Hey!

1049
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:28,500
Hey!

1050
01:57:35,132 --> 01:57:39,094
Oh... Oh, no, quick!
What are we going to do?

1051
01:57:42,473 --> 01:57:43,599
Tie this off!

1052
01:57:48,437 --> 01:57:50,189
Hurry! Tie it!

1053
01:57:55,819 --> 01:57:58,322
- Got it!
- Ah!

1054
01:58:01,492 --> 01:58:03,368
Aaaargh!

1055
01:58:11,293 --> 01:58:13,212
Get them up now!

1056
01:58:20,302 --> 01:58:22,096
(Straining)

1057
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:28,268
(Gregor) Of course!
North is south, south is north!

1058
01:58:28,393 --> 01:58:31,396
- I was swimming.
- I saw.

1059
01:58:31,522 --> 01:58:34,108
(Gregor) My friends, my friends, look!

1060
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:40,114
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the co-ordinates on Enola's back,

1061
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:43,659
then Dryland is that way!

1062
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:45,285
(He chuckles)

1063
01:59:53,187 --> 01:59:55,272
(Seagulls cry)

1064
02:00:47,241 --> 02:00:50,953
- (Helen laughs)
- It's fresh! All of this!

1065
02:00:51,078 --> 02:00:52,871
It's fresh!

1066
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:57,542
(Gregor laughs)

1067
02:00:59,044 --> 02:01:01,046
(Helen) Come on!

1068
02:01:06,218 --> 02:01:07,302
Woo!

1069
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:11,223
I've found something!

1070
02:01:22,901 --> 02:01:26,154
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.

1071
02:01:27,155 --> 02:01:29,157
I think it was their way.

1072
02:01:31,285 --> 02:01:33,370
(Gregor)
They must have known they were dying.

1073
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,372
(Helen laughs)

1074
02:01:57,936 --> 02:02:00,105
(Music box plays)

1075
02:02:04,109 --> 02:02:05,944
I'm home.

1076
02:02:16,747 --> 02:02:20,042
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

1077
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:27,382
Wait! Wait, I want to show you this.

1078
02:02:48,737 --> 02:02:50,530
(Whinnying)

1079
02:02:59,664 --> 02:03:01,917
(Chorus of bird calls)

1080
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:42,582
First time in your life you got nothing
to say?

1081
02:03:56,638 --> 02:03:59,057
Enola, I have to go now.

1082
02:04:00,058 --> 02:04:02,352
But you came back for me.

1083
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:05,564
I like you.

1084
02:04:10,861 --> 02:04:12,821
Why are you leaving?

1085
02:04:16,324 --> 02:04:20,245
- I don't belong here. I belong out there.
- You belong here.

1086
02:04:22,247 --> 02:04:25,625
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

1087
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:29,087
Helen said that it's only landsickness.

1088
02:04:29,754 --> 02:04:32,174
We're all feeling it. It'll go away soon.

1089
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:35,760
It's more than that.

1090
02:06:12,649 --> 02:06:14,693
(Panting)
