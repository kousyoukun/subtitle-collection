because I need to ask you a question.

181
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,470
Where... Where did
your dirt come from?

182
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,870
Is it from Dryland?

183

Do you know what this is?

terrible, didn't they?

To cause all this water.
Hundreds... Hundreds of years ago.

If I tell you,
will you open this lock?

I haven't a key.

188
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,590
- There's a mooring cleat down there.
- What?

189
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,670
- Good as any key.
- A mooring cleat?

190
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,550
I won't hurt anyone.
I'll just leave.

- I'll be right back.
- [Man] Gregor!

After considerable deliberation
of the evidence at hand,

199
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,270
it is our decision
that this mute-o...

200
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,550
does, indeed,
constitute a threat.

Too strange for life he was.

00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,670
First one that
tells me lives.

319
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,550
- I saw a girl. I saw, I saw...
- It was... Sh-She had
a big tattoo on her.

320
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,710
[Indistinct]

321
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,750
You won.
Start over.

322
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,910
I saw a girl.
I'm not sure,

323
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,790
but I think she got on that boat
with three hulls.

324
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,870
But I think she got on that boat
with three hulls.

325
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,390
- The boat that cost me
a thousand G's of go-juice?
- Yeah, the mute-o's boat.

326
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,390
- Mute-o?
- Yeah. He got these slits here.

327
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,750
Like... [Laughing]
Like fish gills.

328
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,190
He wasn't really a man.

329
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,830
A fluke of evolution.

330
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,750
Oh, I'm sorry.
A fluke of, uh...

331
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,310
- Evolution.
- I know!

332
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,270
- No! No, you said
you wouldn't kill me!
- Did I say that?

333
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,430
- Witnesses, anybody, did I?
- Yes, yes, yes! You said...

334
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,950
- You said it.
- Oh, I may have.

335
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,910
I may have.

336
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,350
- [Gasping, Screaming]
- [Gunshot]

337
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,750
We get to the 'Deez,

338
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,390
tank up that sky boat;
send it out on patrol.

339
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,350
We gotta keep an eye out...

340
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,750
for that ichthy-freak.

341
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,630
You been there, haven't you?

342
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,950
Dryland?

343
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,310
You know where it is.

344
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,310
Yeah, I know where it is.

345
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,950
And, uh... And we're going?

346
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,990
You and I are.

347
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,750
The kid we gotta pitch
over the side.

348
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,630
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

349
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,270
I'm takin' on water.

350
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,710
I'd be lucky to get
half a hydro ration out of that.

351
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,470
You know...
I said I won't drink.

352
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,990
For 12 days?

353
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,590
No. It's better
one of you dies now...

354
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,710
than both of you die slow.

355
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,910
Wait. Wait.

356
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,550
We saved your life.
We got you out.

357
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,670
No, you got me out so you
could get out. We're even.

358
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,750
She can cook.
She can fish.

359
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,030
- So can I.
- Then take my necklace.
Take my necklace.

360
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,470
- I got better ones below.
- No, look!

361
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,430
Oh.

362
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,550
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

363
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,710
I can understand
why you would want to.

364
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,790
But she's a child.

365
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,510
?? [Enola Humming]

366
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,350
Is there something else then?

367
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,350
Enola! Go below.

368
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,430
Enola.

369
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,950
Yeah. You said so yourself.

370
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,670
Been out there a long time.

371
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,430
Couple hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

372
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,870
- We're not like that.
- You all are.

373
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,750
Know what I was really thinkin'?

374
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,950
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

375
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,830
You got nothin' I need.

376
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,070
You're taking us to Dryland.

377
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,390
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

378
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,790
- Believe me. I'm not
the one to start on.
- Both of us!

379
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,870
How long you plan
to hold that on me?

380
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,070
As long as it takes.

381
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,750
- Okay.
- No!

382
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,590
Let me out of here!

383
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,510
Where the hell are you?
Don't you touch my child.

384
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,550
Come here!
[Indistinct Shouting]

385
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,950
[Groaning]

386
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,470
Okay, now don't move, okay?
There.

387
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,870
Ohh. Oh, lookin'
real good, yeah.

388
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,230
There. There.

389
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,230
All done.

390
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,270
Now, there may be some small problem
in depth perception.

391
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:35,230
Well, it better not
screw up my short game.

392
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,150
- Well?
- [Smokers] Looks good.
I like it. Yeah.

393
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,270
- I like it better than your real eye.
- Much better.

394
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,950
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.
- Looks like shit.

395
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,910
That's why I love children.
No guile.

396
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,710
It does look like shit.

397
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,710
And it feels like cold shit!

398
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:02,190
Deacon? What...

399
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:06,790
I'm sorry. L-lt's just that
there's a problem in the pit.

400
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,790
Maybe you should come.

401
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,710
- Let's drive.
- [Chattering]

402
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,950
The pit. Don't bother
with the scenic route.

403
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,950
[Deacon] Drive!

404
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,230
Hey, it's drivin' better.

405
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,590
Get off!

406
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,990
Get over there.
Get out of the way.

407
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,150
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.

408
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,910
You guys are great.
Bless all you cousins over there.

409
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,390
Keep up the good work.
Growth is progress. Growth is progress.

410
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,070
Somebody!
Hey, up there!

411
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,110
Take it off!

412
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,910
- Yes.
- Your Deaconship.

413
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,950
Hello. Good morning.
Or night,

414
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,590
whichever the case may be.

415
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,390
- What is it? I'm a busy man.
- I thought you should know.

416
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,150
We're down to exactly...

417
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,190
four feet, nine inches
of black stuff.

418
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,630
- [Spitting]
- Thank you, sir.

419
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,390
- How many G's is that after refinin'?
- Maybe three refuelers.

420
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,110
- We'll burn through that in two lunars.
- Sweet Joe!

421
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,870
Will somebody please tell me
what's happened to this place?

422
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,950
We outgrowed it.

423
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,910
All right, the only thing
that is important is the tattooed girl.

424
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,310
We don't spare any go-juice
findin' her.

425
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,430
We don't waste it anywhere else.
You cancel all those tractor pulls...

426
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,390
and all that stuff
until later.

427
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,430
You got it?

428
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,910
Dryland is the mother lode.

429
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,030
[Laughing]
On your toes.

430
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,390
Excellent.

431
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,230
- Hi.
- Move.

432
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,750
Enola!
Enola, come here!

433
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,950
Come on!

434
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,910
Enola, come over here.

435
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,150
Hey!

436
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,990
- What are ya doin'?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

437
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,230
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

438
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,030
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

439
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,430
- I drew it for you.
- You don't draw on anything.
You understand?

440
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,990
What...

441
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,190
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

442
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,070
You take up space
and you slow me down.

443
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,550
You know, she's just a little girl.

444
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,870
- She doesn't know your rules.
- You wanna stay?

445
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,910
You teach her.

446
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,430
Enola, what'd I tell you?

447
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,190
You're not so tough.
You know that?

448
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,390
How many people
have you killed?

449
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,110
Ten? Twenty?

450
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,550
- You talk a lot.
- I talk a lot 'cause
you don't talk at all.

451
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,590
Now how many?

452
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,230
- Including little girls?
- I'm not afraid of you.

453
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,310
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly
if you cut your hair.

454
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:10,350
In fact, you talk all the time.

455
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,510
- It's like a storm
when you're around.
- Enola!

456
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,230
Hey! What are you doing?

457
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,390
- [Enola] Helen!
- [Helen] You bastard!
She can't swim!

458
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,390
Help me! Helen!

459
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,030
Helen, help me!

460
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,590
Helen!

461
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,830
[Sobbing]
Helen, help me!

462
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,870
[Gasping]

463
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,990
Helen! Helen!

464
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,510
Hold on!

465
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,070
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

466
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,110
Oh, please, come back.
Please!

467
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,590
Please! Oh, please!

468
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,630
[Choking]

469
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,110
Hey! [Gasping]

470
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:06,070
Hold on.
Okay, almost...

471
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,510
there.

472
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,670
Thanks. I swear,

473
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,150
Thanks. I swear,

474
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,630
if you ever touch her again...

475
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,990
You son of a bitch.
Look at me.

476
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,510
You will go to bed that night,
and you will never wake up.

477
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,030
- Shut up.
- What?

478
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,030
- [Helen] Smokers?
- Yeah.

479
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,310
Can't we outrun them?

480
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:41,310
- [Engine Humming]
- Not with my sail down.

481
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,510
- What are you thinkin' about?
- That's a nice touch.

482
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,510
That's them.

483
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,550
Don't hit the kid.

484
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,390
[Cackling]

485
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,990
Hey!

486
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,990
Coward!

487
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,110
[Laughing]

488
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,470
Fuck!

489
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,630
No!

490
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,710
[Groaning]

491
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,390
[Indistinct]

492
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,470
Cut it!

493
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,550
Come on! Come on!

494
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,550
[Yells]
All right. Okay.

495
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,590
[Gunfire]

496
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,750
[Helen]
Oh, I'm really sorry.

497
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,910
I'm sorry.
But you didn't give me much choice.

498
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,950
Oh, I know.

499
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,790
But you ran away.
L... What?

500
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,750
What are you do...
No! Please, no! No!

501
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,590
[Grunting]

502
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:58,230
Don't ever touch
anything on my boat again.

503
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,550
She said she was sorry!

504
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,390
That means you're supposed
to say something back!

505
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,590
- Did you say somethin'?
- [Enola] Mm-mmm.

506
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,750
[Deacon] The child...
did he have the girl with him?

507
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,270
- [Pilot] Uh-huh.
- Seems to me if we launch now,

508
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,390
we can cut him down
just about here.

509
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,630
- If he doesn't change course.
- Ah, it's not likely.

510
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:15,350
He's a wily one,
that ichthy-demon.

511
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,910
Yeah, if he knows
he's been spotted,

512
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,790
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

513
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:25,510
which is exactly why
he'll keep his heading.

514
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,750
The important question is,
where's he heading?

515
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:32,430
And does he know
how precious his cargo is?

516
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,790
I say that he's headed here,
and we take him here.

517
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:47,670
[Drifter Shouting]

518
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,910
- Drifter?
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,910
- [Shouting Continues]
- [Helen] Are we gonna stop?

520
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,910
- Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

521
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,070
I thought you all
stopped for each other.

522
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,030
Well... maybe he has some food!

523
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,310
Don't find many who follow
the rules anymore.

524
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:13,030
Well, make it quick.
What's your business?

525
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,030
Trade.

526
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,950
You got any resin?

527
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:30,670
Resin? He's gotta be out of
his mind. He's out of his mind.
I don't have any resin.

528
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,150
- [Babbling]
- You been outwater
a long time, haven't you?

529
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,510
Must be jokin' me, man.
Resin! You don't got enough.

530
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,750
How 'bout food?

531
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,790
Could you say that again, please?

532
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,830
- How 'bout food?
- Ah, yeah, food.

533
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,470
Yeah, that'd be good, eh?

534
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:50,550
I haven't eaten in, well,
you know, forever.

535
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:54,110
Which one of you two is a cook?

536
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,910
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress.
[Chuckling]

537
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,990
Like you said,
I don't have much.

538
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,390
Now listen, eh? [Mumbles]
Let's see. What do I have to do?

539
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,150
We can start with that wee orchard
you got over there.

540
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:12,110
- [Whooping]
- All right, hold it there.

541
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,710
- [Mariner] We can talk.
- [Drifter] Fair enough.

542
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,750
[Babbling]

543
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,990
It's a nice rod, isn't it?

544
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,030
I like that rod.
It's a nice rod. [Babbles]

545
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,190
Got yourself a wee harem
goin' here now, do ya?

546
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,910
What you want for the women?

547
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:46,510
We're not for sale.

548
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,150
Not for sale?
There's no such thing as not for sale.

549
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,590
"Not for sale"!
Not for sale, eh?

550
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,030
- Are they a pair or would you
consider sellin' 'em separate?
- No.

551
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:01,030
Our business is done here unless you got
some resin for sale you can part with.

552
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,110
I told you once already,
I don't have it.

553
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:05,950
I-I-I don't have it.
Don't have it. Don't have it.

554
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:10,110
Haven't seen neither for trade
in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

555
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,750
I do have somethin' that'll
make you change your mind.

556
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:20,630
Somethin' that you can't pass on.
[Giggles]

557
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:24,990
I took it off
an Atoller refugee camp.

558
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,990
The life savings
of the entire clan.

559
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,950
Paper.
[Babbles]

560
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:43,590
It's paper. Have you ever
seen paper? Look at it.

561
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,590
Smell it.

562
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,470
I been savin' it
for a special trade.

563
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,110
Don't you do it.

564
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,070
You know, maybe I'm talkin'
to the wrong person here.

565
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,270
Whose boat is this?
Is it your boat or your boat?

566
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,990
No. No, it's his boat.
But he doesn't own us.

567
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,030
Half an hour.

568
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:16,710
[Mumbling, Babbling]
Out of his mind somethin' there.

569
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:20,750
I got two pages in here, man!
I mean, I'd get half a dozen
girls with this, you know.

570
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,550
Half an hour.

571
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,710
- You tradin' or not?
- Don't.

572
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,750
Shut up.

573
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:31,310
Okay.

574
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,230
Forty-five minutes
with the wee one right there.

575
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,790
I like to do the talkin',
if you know what I mean.

576
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,510
No!

577
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,630
Fair. Come, come,
come, come, come!

578
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,990
No. My boat.

579
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:53,270
- Fair enough. Fair enough.
Good, good, good. Aye.
- Helen.

580
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,950
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

581
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,190
[Chuckling]

582
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,190
It's been a while for me now.

583
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:49,910
Guess it's been
more than a while, actually.

584
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,990
I've only got half an hour.
[Repeating] Half an hour,
half an hour, half an hour...

585
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,030
[Mumbles]
Great, great, great...

586
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:05,910
[Gasps] Ooh! You're so beautiful.
Aye! Anyone ever told you that?

587
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,910
Give me that. What are you doin'?
It's just a game.

588
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,230
Oh, I, um... I, uh...
We was just playin'.

589
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:20,350
The trade's off.

590
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,310
I changed my mind.

591
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:26,350
Well, um... Well,
you can't do that.

592
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,990
I mean, a deal's a deal, eh?

593
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,910
I just did.

594
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:33,110
Hey!

595
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:37,790
She's mine. Aye. No. No, no
I own her. But... No.

596
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,790
- Go on.
- Get, get, get.
Go, go, go. Good, good.

597
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:45,190
But don't go too far now.
This won't take but a minute.

598
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:55,750
I hate this boat.
I hate this boat!

599
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:58,390
You bastard.

600
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:07,670
You... You're pretty stingy for a man
who's got everything, aren't ya now?

601
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,750
Oh-h-h. Ohh.

602

- [Yells]
- [Crashing]

Ah, you bastard!

[Banging, Crashing Continue]

605
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:39,910
Where's me boat?

606
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,190
Where's me boat?

607
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:47,350
[Mumbling]

608
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,430
Help me to me boat.

609
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:57,150
Ow! Me boat.

610
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,030
Me boat.

611
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,950
[Helen]
What the... No!

612
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,510
Never catch anything
with this. It's useless.

613
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,390
[Helen Gasps]

614
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,990
Look, I'm sorry.
You were right about the pole.

615
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,830
You were right,
but we have to eat.

616
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,390
Now I know
you can hear me!

617
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,990
Now we can fish for ourselves.
You show us what to do.

618
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:03,310
You must know how.
Even you gotta eat!

619
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,870
You just sit there.

620
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,310
- What...
- [Mumbling] I don't know.

621
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:10,150
Happy now?

622
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:19,030
?? [Humming]

?? [Humming Continues]

624
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,190
You don't like my singing,
do you?

625
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:37,150
Helen says you don't like my singing
'cause you can't sing.

626
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:45,990
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

627
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:51,270
The sound of the world.

628
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:58,350
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud,

629
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,390
and you're movin' around
all the time.

630
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,230
Try sittin' still.

Eyeball?

01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,630
I wish I had feet like his.

633
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,670
Then maybe I could swim.

Enola.

635
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,230
[Burps] Sorry.

636
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,390
Never met a person
couldn't swim before.

637
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:48,070
I can't.

638
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,550
People say I was weird.

639
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,550
Maybe they were right.

640
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:59,510
Maybe they were right
about you too.

641
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,350
Enola wanted to give you this.

642
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:36,310
And this.

643
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,510
She won't take it again.

644
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,790
You don't look much like her.

645
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:54,070
- Well, I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.
- You act like it.

646
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,070
What are those marks
on her back?

647
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,630
Nothing.
They're just fanciful things.

648
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,190
- Like what she draws?
- She draws what she sees.

649
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,110
She's like a mirror.

650
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,230
People on the atoll
thought she was a...

651

Uh-huh. Yeah.

653
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,230
I just thought
she was special.

654

I'm not givin' it
to her. It's just...

655
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,510
A loan.

656
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:38,550
Yeah. I'm not
givin' it to her.

657
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:47,550
Is Dryland beautiful?

You said we'd get
to Dryland today.

Today. Tomorrow.
What's it matter?

670
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,630
I need resin.

- It's PortuGreek. Their own language.

No! You said so yourself

You did.

- It doesn't exist!
- Well, how can you be so sure?

Because I've sailed farther than most

787
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,590
What are we, barbarians here?

788
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,150
Goodness gracious.
Sakes alive.

789
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,590
Come on. Outta here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

790
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:14,630
Well, rub-a-dub-dub.
[Chuckles]

791
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:19,910
You wanna come over here
and sit on my lap?

792
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:22,710
No? Ahem.

793
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:25,790
How 'bout a cigarette?

794
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:29,390
Nothin' like a good smoke
if you miss your mom.

795
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:31,390
Never too young to start.

796
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,390
No. Well, I got somethin'
right here I know you'd like.

797
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:40,630
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

798
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:46,790
Huh?
Now they're yours...

799
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,230
if you help me with just
one problem, all right?

800
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:57,750
Now, ahem... Now that tattoo
on your back... Ahem.

801
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:03,910
I've been told that, uh...
that's actually a map?

802
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,550
It's the way to Dryland.

803
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:11,550
Now we're gettin' someplace.

804
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,190
Could you teach me
how to read that?

805
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,870
Setback.

806
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:27,310
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

807
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:32,470
You know, like your mommy or
your pet fish? Did he say anything?

808
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:34,910
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

809
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:40,510
Girl, I don't give a shit
what he'd like. He took out my eye.

810
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:46,470
And if I ever see him again, I'm gonna
cut open his head and eat his brains!

811
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,750
You think he'd like that?

812
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:52,630
Can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

813
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:55,750
But he's not here.

814
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:57,750
And he ain't comin'.

815
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:59,710
And no one's gonna save you.

816
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,990
He'll come for me. He will.

817
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:07,270
Then you better tell me what I wanna
know or he can see what's left of you...

818
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:09,470
in a goddamn jar.

819
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,030
We're going to die here,
aren't we?

820
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,910
Aren't we?

821
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:55,990
After the atoll,

822
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,790
when I offered myself to you,

823
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,830
why didn't you take me?

824
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,670
'Cause you didn't really want me.

825
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,630
Not really.

826
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:10,750
Have I been asleep long?

827
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:18,470
I was dreaming.

828
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,870
It's funny.

829
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:26,710
I always thought Dryland floated.

830
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:30,110
That it drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

831
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:32,550
Why did you believe in it so much?

832
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:36,430
Because we weren't made for the sea.

833
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:40,910
Got hands... and feet.

834
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:43,670
We're supposed to walk.

835
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,630
I miss her sound.

836
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:53,070
Don't you?

837
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:58,510
[Gregor] Helen!

838
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:01,710
He... No, no, no.
Helen, up here. Above you!

839
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:04,230
- [Chuckling]
- [Helen] Gregor!

840
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:08,630
[Chuckling Continues]

841
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:11,510
Smart thinking
to burn your boat.

842
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:15,190
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

843
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,270
Who's that with you?

844
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:21,070
Ichthyus Sapien,
is that really you?

845
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:25,110
I'll throw the rope down.
You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

846
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:30,870
Helen. Where's Enola?

847
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:36,310
Smokers took her. They'd have me too
if it weren't for him.

848
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:40,670
My friend, thank you.
Very human of you.

849
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,190
Go grab your things quickly.
Quickly. Come.

850
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:55,110
[Gregor] You see?
Right down there.

851
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,190
There's several of us survivors.
We'll just start over again.

852
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,190
[Man] You can't ask us
to go get her!

853
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,630
[Woman] Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble.

854
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:09,310
[Helen] They don't have any
reason to kill her. They need
to find Dryland just like we do.

855
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:13,310
- Of course.
- [Helen] If the Mariner's
willing to go, why not us?

856
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:15,630
[Woman]
If he wants to go, then let him!

857
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:18,910
[Woman #2] We don't want you here!
You or the girl!

858
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:23,350
Helen. The papers
the Mariner brought you...

859
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:28,070
It's the same language the tattoo
is written in. They're numbers.

860
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:31,550
- [Man] Gregor,
you're as crazy as she is!
- [Woman] We can't stay here!

861
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:35,110
We're wasting valuable time.
More Smokers will come.
We need to be moving now!

862
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:39,630
My friends, don't you see we need
this child if we want to find Dryland?

863
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,710
- I'm not goin'.
- Nobody is.

864
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:44,070
[Woman] We've seen their smoke
on the horizon!

865
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,910
- Know what that is yet?
- The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

866
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:52,590
It seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location:
Latitude, longitude.

867
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:57,390
It doesn't make sense, though.
The numbers, they seem
to be backwards or something.

868
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:59,710
- It's upside down.
- The world?

869
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,310
The poles have reversed themselves?

870
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:04,750
I've been mappin' the cities below.

871
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,910
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

872
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:14,190
- [Man] That's blasphemy!
- [Helen] No, it's true.

873
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:18,990
I've seen it with
my own eyes. There is land.
It's right under our keel.

874
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:21,110
- None of it's dry anymore.
- Some is.

875
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:27,190
Enola's been there.
I know that now. I saw what she drew.

876
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:31,110
So that's why he's going after Enola...
to find Dryland.

877
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:33,910
I don't care about Dryland.

878
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,830
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

879
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:39,110
He doesn't even know
which direction they came from.

880
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:44,070
- [Man] I say let him go.
- [Woman] We're better off
without them anyway!

881
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:47,910
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

882
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:52,430
[Woman] Forget the mute-o, Helen.
If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

883
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:56,230
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.

884
01:38:56,310 --> 01:39:00,310
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

885
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:09,190
[Deacon] You got that tattoo
figured out yet?

886
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:11,910
It would be easier if it was flat...
big and flat.

887
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:14,870
- It needs to be flat.
- What you got in mind?

888
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:19,190
Well, you cut it off her back.
You stretch it, mount it.

889
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:22,950
- Give us a proper look.
- Take her down below until I holler.

890
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:25,230
Saint Joe, we're close.

891
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:29,910

- [Man] Yeah, we're
tired of your visions!

914
01:42:23,892 --> 01:42:26,172
What about the land
you promised us?

I've had a vision so great...

918
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:37,132
that as it came to me, I wept.

919
01:42:37,172 --> 01:42:41,252
- And in this splenditudinous

- Is that Bone's ride?

920
01:42:41,332 --> 01:42:43,412
- Is that blood on the seat?

And you know
what it is that I saw.

Ha. That's right.

He's not a freak,
and he can take you anytime.

01:44:16,252 --> 01:44:18,212
Shit.

939
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:20,452
It's Horse.

940
01:44:21,892 --> 01:44:24,332
- Find him. Find him!
- Come on!

941
01:44:24,412 --> 01:44:28,812
- [Crowd Chanting]
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

942
01:44:28,892 --> 01:44:32,412
- Come on.
- Gettin' nervous, aren't you?

943
01:44:36,852 --> 01:44:38,772
I don't get nervous.

944
01:44:40,052 --> 01:44:42,492
[Deacon]
And if there's a river, we'll dam it.

945
01:44:42,572 --> 01:44:47,092
And if there's a tree,
we'll ram it.

946
01:44:47,172 --> 01:44:50,252
'Cause I'm talkin' progress here.

947
01:44:50,332 --> 01:44:53,372
Yes, sir. I'm talkin' development.

948
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:57,452
- [Man] Yeah!
- For we shall suck and savor...

949
01:44:57,492 --> 01:45:02,052
the sweet flavor of Dryland.

950
01:45:02,092 --> 01:45:03,972
- [Crowd Whistling]
- [Enola] Face is all red.

951
01:45:04,052 --> 01:45:09,132
- [Deacon Continues Faintly]
- Helen said with anybody
that has a face that red,

952
01:45:09,172 --> 01:45:11,332
he's had too much sun
or too much to drink.

953
01:45:11,412 --> 01:45:15,452
- All right, that's it.
I'm gonna burn your face.
- Almost time.

954
01:45:15,532 --> 01:45:19,572
- [Clanging]
- What's up?
- We're just talkin' about our friend.

955
01:45:22,052 --> 01:45:24,932
- [Doctor] What's his name?
- [Enola] He doesn't have a name.

956
01:45:25,012 --> 01:45:27,492
So death can't find him.

957
01:45:27,572 --> 01:45:29,492
Nah-nah.

958
01:45:32,932 --> 01:45:36,852
Doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

959
01:45:36,932 --> 01:45:39,852
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

960
01:45:39,932 --> 01:45:43,412
He's fast and strong
like a big wind.

961
01:45:43,492 --> 01:45:46,852
He can hear a hundred miles
and see a hundred miles underwater.

962
01:45:46,932 --> 01:45:50,972
- [Gagging]
- He can hide in the shadow
of the noon sun.

963
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:54,932
He could be right behind you, and you
won't even know it 'til you're dead!

964
01:45:57,412 --> 01:45:59,412
Give it a rest.

965
01:46:00,852 --> 01:46:02,852
He'll come for me. He will.

966
01:46:02,892 --> 01:46:05,412
- [Deacon Addressing Crowd]
We are the people...
- Yeah?

967
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:09,012
- Well, I hope he does.
- [Deacon] The Lord's creation.

968
01:46:10,252 --> 01:46:12,172
Remember you said that.

969
01:46:13,332 --> 01:46:16,132
[Deacon Continues]
Look at us.

970
01:46:16,172 --> 01:46:18,852
- Look at us here today.
- [Man] Yeah!

971
01:46:18,932 --> 01:46:22,452
Dryland is not just
our destination,

972
01:46:22,492 --> 01:46:24,572
but it is our destiny!

973
01:46:24,652 --> 01:46:27,052
[Cheering, Whistling]

974
01:46:34,092 --> 01:46:36,492
Find him. Find him!

975
01:46:36,532 --> 01:46:38,652
How can I find...

976
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,012
this glorious place?

977
01:46:42,052 --> 01:46:44,892
And he said to me:

978
01:46:44,932 --> 01:46:48,892
"A child shall lead you."

979
01:46:50,332 --> 01:46:52,412
A child.

980
01:46:52,492 --> 01:46:54,892
- And behold!
- It's time.

981
01:46:54,972 --> 01:46:58,012
The instrument of our salvation!

982
01:46:58,052 --> 01:47:01,932
[Crowd Cheering]

983
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:07,972
[Deacon]
Our guide in the wild.

984
01:47:08,052 --> 01:47:10,372
[Deacon]
Our beacon in the darkness.

985
01:47:10,412 --> 01:47:12,372
Turn her around, Nord.

986
01:47:12,412 --> 01:47:15,252
She has shown me the path!

987
01:47:15,332 --> 01:47:17,932
[Cheering]

988
01:47:19,652 --> 01:47:23,172
And before the holy-most moment
is upon us,

989
01:47:23,252 --> 01:47:26,652
let's sacrifice one
to old Saint Joe.

990
01:47:29,972 --> 01:47:33,452
And let's get this
tub of shit up to speed.

991
01:47:39,532 --> 01:47:41,492
Yep.

992
01:47:49,252 --> 01:47:52,172
[Wild Cheering]

993
01:48:19,532 --> 01:48:21,452
Pull!

994
01:48:21,532 --> 01:48:24,252
- Pull!
- Pull!

995
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:26,412
- Pull.
- Pull!

996
01:48:41,012 --> 01:48:42,812
Ow.

997
01:48:46,412 --> 01:48:49,652
- So which way we rowin'?
- I don't have a goddamn clue.

998
01:48:49,692 --> 01:48:51,652
[Laughs]
Don't worry.

999
01:48:51,732 --> 01:48:54,692
They'll row for a month
before they figure out I'm fakin' it.

1000
01:48:54,732 --> 01:48:57,492
But, um, wh-wh...

1001
01:48:57,532 --> 01:49:00,652
Oh, you want details.
Well, I'm not tellin' these savages...

1002
01:49:00,692 --> 01:49:03,012
that we haven't
solved the map yet.

1003
01:49:03,092 --> 01:49:08,452
I promised them results,
and I'll get 'em if I gotta
cut 'em out of her goddamn back.

1004
01:49:09,772 --> 01:49:13,212
Who is that?
Who is that?

1005
01:49:14,332 --> 01:49:16,732
Maybe one of
the spare rowers?

1006
01:49:24,652 --> 01:49:27,412
Why aren't you rowin'?

1007
01:49:36,092 --> 01:49:38,132
- It's him.
- It is him.

1008
01:49:39,492 --> 01:49:42,212
You guys are in
so much trouble.

1009
01:49:45,092 --> 01:49:49,412
Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.

1010
01:49:49,452 --> 01:49:53,252
You know, he's like
a turd that won't flush.

1011
01:49:53,332 --> 01:49:56,052
I want the girl.

1012
01:49:58,412 --> 01:50:03,532
You know, I thought you
were stupid, friend.

1013
01:50:03,612 --> 01:50:06,532
- [Gun Cocking]
- But I underestimated you.

1014
01:50:06,612 --> 01:50:09,612
You're a total freakin' retard.

1015
01:50:09,692 --> 01:50:12,732
[Laughing]

1016
01:50:12,812 --> 01:50:16,172
I want the girl. That's all.

1017
01:50:16,212 --> 01:50:20,892
Well, what on this screwed-up Earth
makes you think you're gonna get her?

1018
01:50:29,292 --> 01:50:31,252
You know what this is?

1019
01:50:35,532 --> 01:50:38,092
I drop it, you burn.

1020
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:41,932
- We all burn.
- Now wait, wait, wait, wait.

1021
01:50:42,172 --> 01:50:45,812
Ahem. Let's not do
anything rash here.

1022
01:50:45,892 --> 01:50:49,212
I mean, uh, are you sure
she's worth all this?

1023
01:50:49,292 --> 01:50:52,412
She never does stop talkin'.
She never shuts up.

1024
01:50:52,492 --> 01:50:54,772
- I noticed.
- What is it then?

1025
01:50:54,852 --> 01:50:57,252
Huh? It's the map.

1026
01:50:58,692 --> 01:51:01,452
She's my friend.

1027
01:51:01,532 --> 01:51:04,332
Golly gee.
A single tear rolls down my cheek.

1028
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:07,332
I mean, you're gonna
die for your friend.

1029
01:51:08,732 --> 01:51:10,652
If it comes to that.

1030
01:51:12,892 --> 01:51:17,412
- He's bluffing. I'll kill him.
- He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.

1031
01:51:17,492 --> 01:51:18,652
Shut up!

1032
01:51:19,932 --> 01:51:25,212
I don't... l-l... I don't think
you're gonna drop that torch, my friend.

1033
01:51:25,292 --> 01:51:28,852
- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

1034
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:35,292
No!

1035
01:51:42,252 --> 01:51:44,852

Let's go, goddamn it!

- Don't just stand there!
Kill somethin'!

01:58:21,772 --> 01:58:25,132
- [Enola Grunting]
- [Gregor Laughing]

1094
01:58:25,172 --> 01:58:28,692
- [Gregor] Of course!
North is south.
- What?

1095
01:58:28,772 --> 01:58:32,092
- South is north.
- I was swimming.

1096
01:58:32,132 --> 01:58:34,332
- I saw.
- [Gregor] My friends.

1097
01:58:34,412 --> 01:58:36,612
My friends, look.

1098
01:58:36,692 --> 01:58:41,412
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,

1099
01:58:43,612 --> 01:58:46,772
then Dryland is that way!

1100
01:59:54,692 --> 01:59:57,372
[Sea Gull Chattering]

1101
02:00:48,132 --> 02:00:51,132
- [Helen Laughing]
- It's fresh!

1102
02:00:51,212 --> 02:00:53,892
All of this!
It's fresh!

1103
02:00:53,972 --> 02:00:55,932
[Helen Shrieks]

1104
02:00:56,012 --> 02:01:01,012
[Laughing]

1105
02:01:01,092 --> 02:01:03,052
No!
[Laughing]

1106
02:01:07,492 --> 02:01:09,932
[Helen]
Whoo! Whoo!

1107
02:01:10,012 --> 02:01:12,292
I found something!

1108
02:01:25,012 --> 02:01:28,492
Maybe we should put them
under the dirt.

1109
02:01:28,572 --> 02:01:30,492
I think it was their way.

1110
02:01:32,892 --> 02:01:34,892
[Gregor] They must have known
they were dying.

1111
02:01:34,932 --> 02:01:36,892
[Helen Laughing]

1112
02:01:57,612 --> 02:01:59,532
[Winding Key]

1113
02:02:05,412 --> 02:02:07,332
I'm home.

1114
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:20,892
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

1115
02:02:26,212 --> 02:02:28,892
Wait. Wait!
I want to show you this.

1116
02:02:28,972 --> 02:02:31,892
[Birds Chirping Loudly]

1117
02:02:44,092 --> 02:02:47,412
[Hoofbeats]

1118
02:02:50,132 --> 02:02:54,052
[Whinnying]

1119
02:03:03,412 --> 02:03:06,612
[Birds Twittering, Chirping]

1120
02:03:41,332 --> 02:03:44,052
First time in your life
you got nothin' to say?

1121
02:03:58,932 --> 02:04:01,372
Enola, I have to go now.

1122
02:04:01,452 --> 02:04:03,412
But you came back for me.

1123
02:04:05,492 --> 02:04:07,452
I like you.

1124
02:04:12,572 --> 02:04:14,532
Why are you leaving?

1125
02:04:17,372 --> 02:04:21,092
- I don't belong here.
I belong out there.
- You belong here.

1126
02:04:24,372 --> 02:04:27,292
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

1127
02:04:27,332 --> 02:04:30,172
Helen said that
it's only land sickness.

1128
02:04:31,372 --> 02:04:34,972
We're all feeling it.
It'll go away soon.

1129
02:04:35,052 --> 02:04:36,972
It's more than that.
