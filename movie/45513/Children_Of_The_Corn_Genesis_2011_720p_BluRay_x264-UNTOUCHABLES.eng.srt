1
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:35,803
Hello?

2
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:55,959
I'm home!

3
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,268
Mom!

4
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,534
Dad!

5
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:16,278
Bethany?

6
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,111
Ah!

7
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,420
Mom?

8
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:56,377
Beth?

9
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,044
Bethany?

10
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:04,149
It's me, Cole.

11
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,515
Ahh!

12
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,157
Did you do this?

13
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,361
Who did?

14
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:16,762
He who walks behind the rows.

15
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,895
He said to slay
the righteous with the wicked.

16
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,565
Where is he? Just tell me where he is.

17
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,072
Don't move!

18
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:37,487
Don't make me do it.
Baby killer.

19
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,920
Get back!
Baby killer.

20
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,459
You're a baby killer. Baby killer.

21
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,392
Don't make me do it, not again.

22
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,895
Baby killer!

23
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,162
Baby killer.

24
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,222
Baby...

25
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:53,994
Baby killer. Baby killer!

26
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,532
Get a grip on yourself, soldier.

27
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,498
Baby killer.

28
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:00,932
Baby killer.

29
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,808
Baby killer.

30
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,973
Guilty.

31
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:06,139
And a child shall lead them.

32
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm so hot.

33
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:52,176
And not in a good way.

34
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,509
It shouldn't be much longer.

35
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:57,019
It's been over an hour,
and not a single car has passed by.

36
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,612
We're still in California,
there have to be cars.

37
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,386
Nice bit of deductive reasoning.
Well done.

38
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,595
What if we pour the rest of the
water in the radiator?

39
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,928
Which will get us,
what, 40 feet maybe?

40
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,260
Then we'd be stranded
and without water.

41
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,637
Here.

42
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:16,900
Stay hydrated.

43
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,638
You're drinking for two now, baby.

44
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:26,173
Oh, God.

45
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:28,242
I'm gonna puke.

46
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,754
And so much for hydration.

47
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:37,682
Oh, God.

48
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,324
There's some telephone poles,
maybe a house.

49
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:42,092
Stay here, I'll run up
and call for a tow.

50
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:44,997
You kidding? I'm not gonna
stay here and fried like an egg.

51
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,262
You sure you can handle the walk?

52
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,399
I'm pregnant, I'm not dying.

53
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:53,098
All right, then.
Let's go make some friends.

54
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,287
Thanks, by the way.
For what?

55
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:17,424
For not telling me what a limp
dick I am for taking the scenic route.

56
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,696
I'm still allowed to think it, right?

57
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,362
Oh, yeah, it's cool.

58
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,245
I like it. Meth-lab chic.

59
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:36,718
Let's be nice. Definitely do not
want to antagonize the natives.

60
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:40,751
If the worst should happen,

61
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:43,383
tell Little Bubba that his father
was a great but flawed man.

62
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,428
Our kid's gonna be named Lil' Bubba?
Mm-hmm.

63
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:46,484
OK.

64
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:17,649
Howdy.

65
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,691
I'm Tim Gleason
and this is my wife, Allie.

66
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:27,464
We hate to bother you, sir,
but our car broke down in the heat

67
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,732
and we were wondering...
Can't help you.

68
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:33,401
We don't need any help, just the
use of your phone to call for a tow.

69
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,536
Ain't got no phone.

70
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:41,616
Thanks anyway. Sorry to bother you.

71
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,415
Excuse me, just one more thing.
Since we're without wheels,

72
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,956
can you tell us how far it is
to your nearest neighbor

73
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:48,013
or nearest...

74
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:51,650
...anything?

75
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,830
It be very far.

76
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:58,695
You sure you don't have a phone?
He just said he didn't.

77
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,294
That sure looks a lot like
a phone line to me.

78
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,002
Let's go, Allie.
Don't make a big deal out of this.

79
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:06,599
It's cool, we'll find another way.
It's all good.

80
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,576
It's not all good, it's 120 degrees.

81
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,306
We'll find a ride, OK? Let's go.

82
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,575
Just let me talk to him.
No, you heard him. We're going.

83
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:14,139
Why? 'Cause he might
be a tweaker with a shotgun?

84
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,242
Could you say that any louder?

85
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:20,255
Sir? Hi.
We both know you have a phone...

86
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,790
Asshole!
Take it easy.

87
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,486
What is his problem?
Let it go.

88
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,928
If I have a miscarriage,
it's your fault!

89
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:30,489
Let's go. We're sorry!
No, we're not!

90
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:42,542
All right,
you get yourself on in here.

91
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,349
It wouldn't be right to
leave a woman in

92
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,243
your condition out here in the heat.

93
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,312
Wouldn't be Christian.

94
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,690
So I'm Tim and this is Allie.

95
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,334
Helen.

96
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,345
And this is my husband, Cole.

97
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,949
But everyone around calls
him Preacher.

98
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,783
Your accent. Um, Romanian?

99
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,189
Ukraine.

100
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,361
How long have you been in the States?

101
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,800
Six years, almost.

102
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:19,773
Pretty cool flat-screen you got there.

103
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:21,674
You folks own dish or cable out here?

104
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,076
We ain't got neither.

105
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,240
Just watch videos, huh?

106
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:28,966
That's pretty much all
you need now that

107
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,944
The Sopranos is dead and buried.

108
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,017
I better make that call.
Uh, where's your phone?

109
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,622
I will show you.

110
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:55,867
Thanks.

111
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:59,711
I imagine everything's long distance
from here, so here,

112
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,808
let me leave a little...
Hundred.

113
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,011
Dollars?

114
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:05,452
That's a bit steep for
a phone call, no?

115
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,280
Fifty, whatever you have spare.

116
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,002
Please don't tell my husband.
OK, sure.

117
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:28,807
Do you have any pot?
What? No.

118
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:32,076
Cigarette?
I don't smoke.

119
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,304
We're going to see Tim's grandfather.
He lives in Victorville.

120
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,537
Well, just north of Victorville.

121
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:02,604
He's not doing well.

122
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,481
Tim thought it would be a cool idea
if we took the scenic route.

123
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,213
Always a good idea, right?

124
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:21,595
So... you're pregnant?

125
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:27,194
Yeah... first time.

126
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:31,331
Well, second time, really,
but the first time didn't take.

127
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:34,673
Although I hardly thought of it
as a first time.

128
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,143
More like a false start.

129
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:39,174
But this time it just feels...

130
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:43,551
It just feels kind of... different.

131
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,121
Yeah, we're out on Salt Valley Road.

132
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,785
It's about 140 miles
east of Victorville.

133
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,262
No, Salt Valley.

134
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,561
I don't see Salt Valley...
Sorry?

135
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:58,999
It's not for service here.

136
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,968
Sure you got that right?
I'm...

137
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,769
Is there another name?

138
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:08,038
Old Mine Road.
Nobody calls it Salt Valley any more.

139
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,542
Old Mine Road.
That's quite a ways from here.

140
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:20,017
Sure love the quiet.
There's nothing like it in LA.

141
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:43,306
I... I just thought I saw...
The heat'll do that to you.

142
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,321
Hello?
Take me with you.

143
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,381
Mead's Auto Service?
Mm-hmm.

144
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:00,893
Is...
What can I help you with?

145
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:06,230
We're broken down on Old Mine Road.
Old Mine?

146
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,865
Out past where
the road turns to dirt there?

147
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:16,337
Uh, yeah.
What seems to be the problem?

148
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,947
Radiator. Yeah.

149
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:24,646
It's shot?
The hose is busted for sure.

150
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,913
Be a while before we
can get someone over there.

151
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,861
Late evening, early morning.

152
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:38,329
How much?
Nine hundred plus road tax.

153
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,027
You have AAA ?
No...

154
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,031
No, I'll have to get back to you.

155
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:45,267
We're here 'til six.

156
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,486
You know, it's really hard to get
sweet iced tea in LA.

157
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,292
You have to especially ask for it.

158
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,207
Well?

159
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:29,979
OK, two options.

160
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,578
We catch a tow out of Inyokern.

161
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:37,023
Three hours each way, 900 dollars.
Nine hundred dollars?

162
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:40,551
Plus service cost at double-time
since it's a Sunday.

163
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,064
Extortion, yeah, I know.

164
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:44,957
Not only that,
their one car is on a run

165
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,659
and won't be back until this evening,

166
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:49,330
which means he can't even get here
until 2:00am at the earliest,

167
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,100
and possibly not at all.

168
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,573
All because of one stupid hose.

169
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:58,942
And the good option?

170
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:00,677
That was a good option.

171
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:05,414
Burrelson's Garage, which is less than
an hour away, is closed on Sundays.

172
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:07,183
As luck would have it.

173
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:12,285
What about our Mr. Pritchett?

174
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:17,389
He's coming in the morning. He
could give them a ride to Burrelson's.

175
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,135
All right.

176
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,168
Pritchett?

177
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,443
He comes every Monday morning
around seven.

178
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,745
I'm sure he would be happy
to give you a ride.

179
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,511
A very nice man.

180
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:40,317
We could pick up a
radiator hose at Burrelson's,

181
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:44,224
hitch back and save on the tow.
Get away for pocket change.

182
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:47,127
I'd hate to be a burden.

183
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,596
It's not a burden.

184
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,764
That's what our Lord commands.

185
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,210
Well, now, that was perfect.

186
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:17,621
Actually, I became a vegan
about a year ago,

187
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:20,663
and I plan on staying that way
through the pregnancy.

188
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:24,723
And probably even
as long as I'm nursing.

189
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:39,871
Did you hear that?

190
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,275
The wind gets very strong here.

191
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:10,508
Now, the spare room, such as it is,

192
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,946
is right through that door, there.

193
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm sure it'll be fine.

194
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:15,944
More than fine.

195
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:19,245
Please let me do the dishes,
it's the least...

196
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,817
You let Helen do that.

197
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,898
Please, it's how I relax.

198
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,927
OK, if you insist.

199
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,270
The outhouse is outside
through the front door.

200
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:47,949
If you need running water,
you can get that at the kitchen sink.

201
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,006
Got it.

202
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,616
We are very private people here.

203
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:59,955
And we expect that
you will respect that privacy.

204
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:01,325
Of course.
Absolutely.

205
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:06,164
So don't go wandering around outside
except to go to the outhouse.

206
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:11,833
And do not go anywhere
that you are not invited.

207
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:14,208
Understood.

208
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:38,190
OK, tell me if I'm off here,

209
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:42,635
but freaky old hermit buys himself
a Russian wife off of the Internet

210
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:45,264
and she thinks, "Woo-hoo,
California, here I come,"

211
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:48,367
but winds up so far off the grid
that she might as well be on Mars.

212
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:50,742
Then she hits on a stranded motorist
in the kitchen

213
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,839
while his pregnant wife is getting
the evil eye from freaky hermit guy.

214
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:55,975
Are you kidding? Are you sure she...

215
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,986
Gave me a reach around
while I was on the phone?

216
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:01,387
And sitting on the kitchen table,
skirt hiked up, legs open,

217
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:04,119
blouse open to her nipples? Yeah.

218
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,592
But who am I to judge? Maybe that's
how people cool off around here.

219
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,096
Jesus Christ.

220
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:12,066
No, I think that's freaky
hermit guy's department.

221
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:14,059
That is when he's not
making porn videos

222
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,900
with his wife doing stranded motorists

223
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,271
and selling them on the Internet.
You really think that he's...

224
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,004
Why would he have all that video
equipment with no TV hook-up?

225
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,570
Dude's not making a living
growing tumbleweeds

226
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,980
or selling corn-husk dolls.
I know. That is so freaky, right?

227
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:35,182
Ooh, I'm really getting
creeped out here.

228
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:42,590
OK, and that doesn't help either.
This really, really sucks.

229
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:44,599
I'm not the one
who insisted on coming inside.

230
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:47,568
Really, then why am I pregnant?

231
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:58,372
Even the cracks are little crosses.
Stop it.

232
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:03,047
Damn.
What?

233
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:05,109
Shouldn't have drank all
that iced tea.

234
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:02,167
You gotta be kidding me.

235
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,759
All right...

236
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:30,604
Are you all right?

237
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:33,877
Don't be afraid.

238
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,649
I'm not going to hurt you.

239
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:42,851
What's your name?

240
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,491
Mine's Allie.

241
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:45,847
Grant me one hour
and I will till the soil.

242
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:51,724
Grant me one day
and I will plant the seeds.

243
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:56,591
Grant me one year
and I will reap thy harvest.

244
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:01,526
It's worse. it's way worse
than we thought, OK?

245
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,238
He's got a kid locked
up in the storage shed

246
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,596
and he's out in the garage.

247
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,038
The kid?
No, Preacher.

248
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:09,043
He's out in the garage, which he
turned into a church or a sex den,

249
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,865
just chanting weird shit
about planting

250
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:12,410
and harvesting like some freaky...

251
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:13,074
Slow down.

252
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:15,143
No, listen, we gotta get out of here.

253
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,617
Tonight. But we gotta
take that kid with us.

254
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:20,245
We can't leave him here
with that sick bastard.

255
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,880
I want to kill him,
I just wanna kill him!

256
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:24,687
Hang on, slow down. Deep breaths.
Don't patronize me.

257
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:26,989
He's some fucking psycho
fucking pervert

258
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,052
like those other
sick fucks you read about.

259
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,101
911, OK? We gotta call 911.
I'll do it.

260
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:35,432
Just... We need to get
our shit together first.

261
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:38,405
You think I'm imagining this?

262
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:39,532
I'm just saying...

263
00:31:40,163 --> 00:31:43,804
Remember that time you heard the bears
attacking the tent in Kings Canyon?

264
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,210
Yeah, what does that have
to do with this?

265
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:47,044
Turned out they were squirrels.

266
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:52,482
You don't believe me.
I do, but we need to be specific.

267
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:56,684
They're gonna ask me questions.
Did you... Did you see the kid?

268
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:59,921
No, but I heard him.
I definitely heard him.

269
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,088
Yeah, but actually see him?
Did you see who was in the shed?

270
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:04,598
It was padlocked, OK?
OK! OK, so maybe...

271
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:07,295
Maybe what?
Could it have been...? I mean...

272
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:08,768
What did you hear?
Crying.

273
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:09,580
Helen.

274
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:12,602
No, it wasn't a woman crying in there,

275
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:15,234
it was a little boy
or little girl, a child.

276
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,769
Imagine if it was our child.

277
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:21,213
What if it was our child?
OK, OK, OK. I'll call for help.

278
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:23,251
Thank you.
You say Preacher's in the garage?

279
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:24,945
He was, I don't know about now.

280
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:27,454
You stay here, watch the window.
If you see him coming back...

281
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,512
What?

282
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,826
Never mind, just stay put.
I'll take care of it.

283
00:32:31,882 --> 00:32:34,123
No, what if he catches you?
I can take him if I have to.

284
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:37,131
You don't know that, he's big.
I took a judo class in high school.

285
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,631
Tim...

286
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,895
Oh, shit.

287
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,471
Goddamn it.

288
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:47,417
Ahh!

289
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,655
You scared the shit out of me.

290
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:53,598
Did you see him?
Did you see the little kid?

291
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:57,469
Yeah, all it is is little close-ups.
No, he was just in here.

292
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:58,528
What?

293
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,203
Holy shit, what's with the blood?

294
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,307
There's all sorts of broken glass
and rusty nails out there.

295
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:07,109
He might still be in here.

296
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:16,788
Oh, God, he's coming.
You did make the call, right?

297
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:17,917
Right?

298
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:21,019
No, not yet, I...
Un-fucking-believable.

299
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,963
Where are you going?
Just make the call.

300
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,241
Hey, I...

301
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:38,006
I was wondering if you could wait on
the porch while I go to the outhouse.

302
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:41,379
It's dark and I'm a bit scared
to be out there by myself.

303
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,484
Ain't you already been out there?
No.

304
00:35:51,548 --> 00:35:53,323
I've been kind of holding it.

305
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:02,030
Last time I was in
an actual outhouse, I was a kid

306
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,901
and we were visiting a state park...

307
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:09,500
My brother pulled open the door and
shoved me inside and held it closed,

308
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:12,240
so you can see why I'm still a bit...

309
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:14,772
...freaked by...

310
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:22,850
I... I was out once... already.

311
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:29,892
Why? Did you go to the shed?

312
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:30,988
I didn't.

313
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:35,193
I just.. went to the outhouse and...
Oh...

314
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:40,541
Ain't no water out there,
except where that hose leaks,

315
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:44,602
and that's right... by the shed.

316
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:50,146
Stop.

317
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:52,950
I didn't mean to, I was...

318
00:36:54,377 --> 00:36:58,052
I... There were these noises,
and I just...

319
00:36:58,114 --> 00:37:00,424
What noises were there?

320
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,991
I... I don't know, I...

321
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,694
I don't know.

322
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:10,329
I thought I heard something,
but I went to check, and... ow.

323
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:14,568
What did I tell you...

324
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,879
...about sneakin' around?!

325
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:36,094
You have no idea.

326
00:37:37,587 --> 00:37:40,329
I know there's a kid
you keep in the shed back there.

327
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,199
And you film him, I know that much.

328
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,457
But you're right.
I don't know any more

329
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,435
than that and I really don't
want to know.

330
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,443
I just want to get through the night

331
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:52,036
and be on our way when the
delivery guy shows up, that's all.

332
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:54,173
I don't believe you.

333
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:57,377
We go "don't ask, don't tell."

334
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,249
And, in the morning,
the second we're gone,

335
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:01,414
you make sure that kid
is out of the shed.

336
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:04,220
You delete these cards,
throw some bleach on the floor there

337
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,158
and it's our word against yours.
Tim.

338
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:10,164
Our word against yours,
and not a stitch of evidence.

339
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,996
You think I'm in the grip of evil.

340
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,363
I didn't say that.

341
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:18,635
I'm fighting evil.

342
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:26,438
And you...

343
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:30,977
You go back to your room... right now.

344
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:39,382
Her real name is Oksana.

345
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,622
And she deceived me.

346
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:48,503
She told me that she could tell
from my letters that I was a good man,

347
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:54,167
and there were very
few good men in her country.

348
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,940
But she didn't tell me
that she was pregnant.

349
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:04,117
That all she wanted was the chance

350
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:07,747
for her son to be born
on American soil.

351
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:12,189
Evil finds evil.

352
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:14,922
Your wife and her son,
you think they're evil?

353
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:17,523
Oh, no, she was just a mother

354
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:23,162
and like every mother, she wanted
what was best for her child.

355
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:28,767
But I have forgiven her deceit
as God commands.

356
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:33,112
How can you condemn her child
when he's only five years old?

357
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:35,444
He's not her child.

358
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,780
Not any more.
I thought you said he...

359
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:40,079
Oh.

360
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:43,420
I'm from Gatlin, Nebraska.

361
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,319
The people in Gatlin,

362
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:50,559
they know more about certain things...

363
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:56,097
...certain unspeakable things

364
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,900
than you could even imagine.

365
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:07,171
Things like how easy it is
to corrupt a poor child's soul

366
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:12,050
or even just to
steal that soul outright.

367
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:17,750
If I hadn't been in the Army
and stationed overseas

368
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:21,193
when the massacre happened,
I'd be dead now

369
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:26,257
like all the rest of my friends
and my family.

370
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:30,636
Every single adult in Gatlin...

371
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:35,670
...was slaughtered by children.

372
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:41,111
Good children. Christian children.

373
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:43,310
You tell me, Mr. Gleason.

374
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:49,286
What could make a child
do something like that?

375
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:57,456
911, what's the emergency?
Hi, we've been...

376
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:04,361
Well, it seems that uh...

377
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:08,569
...you too, have a deceitful wife.

378
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,648
What happened?
The phone, it just...

379
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:21,245
How?
I don't know.

380
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,053
Did you get through?
I don't know. I don't think so.

381
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,260
It's alright, it's OK, it's OK.

382
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:28,626
Why the hell didn't you make the call?
You had the time.

383
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,961
I was trying to put the camera
on the stand so he wouldn't know.

384
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:33,896
Now it's too late.
I'm sorry.

385
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:37,837
One thing.. You had one thing to do.
I know, I know.

386
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:40,135
Let's go. Let's just go.
It's the middle of the night.

387
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:43,006
Where are we gonna go?
I don't know. I don't care,

388
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,672
just... Please, let's just go.
All right, come on.

389
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:54,247
Ah!

390
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,311
Tim.

391
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:57,681
Don't try and stop us.

392
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:02,555
Oh, God...

393
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:07,068
Who's doing this?
I told you, but you didn't listen.

394
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:09,025
Come on.

395
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:14,274
They never do.

396
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:21,010
What the fuck?!
Something in this house

397
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,380
doesn't want us to leave.
Damn it, like what?

398
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,851
A poltergeist? A ghost?
I don't know!

399
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:33,961
The same thing happened with the
phone, it just jerked out of my hand.

400
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:35,360
This house is rigged.

401
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,763
Pastor thinks he's
David fucking Blaine.

402
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:41,927
That's not it.
Well, what is it then?

403
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,164
You won't believe me.
Try me.

404
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:47,697
Someone in this house is
psychokinetic, like off the charts.

405
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:48,765
Who? The kid?

406
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:53,507
Or Preacher or Helen/Oksana or whoever
someone we don't even know about yet.

407
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:58,808
Tim!

408
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:02,051
Oh, my God!
I'm OK.

409
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:04,819
It wants you to return to your room.

410
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:10,262
You, the deceitful wife and you,
the cheating husband.

411
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:15,030
Don't worry,
it'll release you at dawn.

412
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,529
I hope.

413
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:29,406
"I hope?" "I hope?"
What the hell does that even mean?

414
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:33,913
I'm sorry, we'll get through this.
I promise you, we'll get through...

415
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,584
Allie?

416
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,427
You lied to me.
What?

417
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:44,363
No, what are you talking about?
You fucked her, didn't you?

418
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:49,970
How can you say that? Because of what
that lunatic said? You believe him?

419
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:53,371
Just tell me yes or no.

420
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:57,172
Did you fuck her in the kitchen?
I told you what happened.

421
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:58,678
And that's all?

422
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:01,210
I know that everything's
going insane right now,

423
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,683
but that's no reason for us
to start doubting each other, OK?

424
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:07,813
My God, all we have is each other
right now. You gotta hang on to that.

425
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:12,087
You didn't touch her?
God, no!

426
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:25,897
You fucking pig.
You spineless fucking pig!

427
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:27,635
How could you do this to me?!

428
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:30,701
I don't know what you think you know
or saw, but you gotta believe me...

429
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:31,802
Fuck you!

430
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:38,242
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

431
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:56,053
Wait.

432
00:45:57,954 --> 00:45:59,228
Wait.

433
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,939
The police. You got through!

434
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:26,004
Hey! Officer!
Help us!

435
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:33,306
Officer, please look over here!
Hey!

436
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:34,370
Hello!

437
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,660
Hey! Over here!
Officer! Hello!

438
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:48,753
Look over here!
What are you doing?

439
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:50,957
Why can't he hear us?
I don't know...

440
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:56,969
Here! Hey!
Please!

441
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:59,632
What the hell's wrong with you?
Look over here, damn it!

442
00:49:59,695 --> 00:50:03,040
Please! Mr. Police Officer!
Hey! Look over here, we're here!

443
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,839
Hey, cop!

444
00:50:27,823 --> 00:50:31,202
This isn't happening.
It's not happening.

445
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,399
Did you see them slip anything
into our food or the tea?

446
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:36,375
A hallucinogenic or something?
No, not that I could tell.

447
00:50:36,432 --> 00:50:38,969
Think. Anything odd or out-of-place
when we first got here?

448
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,345
Everything was odd and out-of-place.

449
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:48,387
What if... what if we're dead?
What if we never got out of the car?

450
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:52,358
Like what? We're still dead on the
roadside? From what?

451
00:50:52,415 --> 00:50:54,656
I don't know. Accident?
Heat stroke? I don't know.

452
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:56,318
No, I'm not going there.
There's gotta be a better explanation

453
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,028
than that. There has to be.

454
00:50:58,087 --> 00:51:02,229
We pounded on the window. The cop,
he should have heard us, seen us.

455
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:03,968
I mean, there's no way he
could've missed us.

456
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,295
If he was even really there at all.

457
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:08,501
You saw what happened. That shit
just does not happen in waking life.

458
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:12,774
So we're dreaming.
Asleep and dreaming.

459
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:14,178
No, I didn't say that.

460
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:18,283
No, we're not dreaming.
How can you know for sure?

461
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,378
Look, we can sit here and run through
every pop-culture explanation you want

462
00:51:21,444 --> 00:51:24,391
but that is not gonna help us.
That is not gonna get us out of here.

463
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:27,554
Helen. We gotta talk to Helen.

464
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:28,993
We gotta get her side of this.

465
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:31,497
We gotta get her away from Preacher,
she's a completely...

466
00:51:31,987 --> 00:51:34,024
I'm just trying to get us out of here.

467
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:39,005
No. I'll talk to her, you just
get her away from her husband.

468
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,775
Preacher, I need to talk to you.

469
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:49,377
I know you're in there,
I need to talk to you now.

470
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:54,411
I need to talk to your husband.
He doesn't want to speak with you.

471
00:51:54,477 --> 00:51:55,956
I don't give a shit.

472
00:51:58,447 --> 00:52:00,688
You're only going to make it angry.

473
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,153
I already made it angry,
and I'm still here.

474
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:10,599
Not for long.
Is that a threat, or a premonition?

475
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:12,935
Or are you just trying
to fuck with my head again?

476
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:14,838
Not to mention my wife's.

477
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:29,588
Come here.
What do you want?

478
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:31,318
Don't play innocent with me.

479
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:36,796
I know you want me to think it's the
kid that's somehow doing all this.

480
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:41,631
You know it is. You saw the tape.
I don't know what I saw.

481
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:49,034
Evil's just another kind of life,
and like all life,

482
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:52,875
it doesn't come into
this world fully formed.

483
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:54,278
It's uh...

484
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:59,342
it's like a seed,
floating in the wind.

485
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:04,016
That's where the Bible got it wrong.

486
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:10,995
I'm gonna skip, for the moment,
what you did to my husband or why.

487
00:53:11,053 --> 00:53:15,900
But, believe me, I'll come
back to it and it won't be pretty.

488
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:24,006
Why do you keep your little boy
locked up in that shed?

489
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,509
Look, I know you're afraid
of your husband,

490
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:33,384
but whatever it is you think
that he can do to you,

491
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:37,584
is nothing compared with
25 years to life

492
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:41,924
in a prison full of homicidal mothers
who would love to carve you up

493
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:46,490
like a Christmas goose for
what you're doing to your own child.

494
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:50,037
You saw the signs.

495
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,306
Maybe if you hadn't been looking for
them, you wouldn't have noticed them.

496
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:58,238
But you saw them.

497
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,077
Just like you, I had to be sure.

498
00:54:03,138 --> 00:54:06,176
I studied those images for weeks.

499
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:08,180
I don't know what I saw.

500
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:17,030
It's growing inside of him.

501
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:23,499
Learning, developing.
Rapidly, like a child.

502
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:27,469
At first it started out
with just simple things

503
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:30,032
like rattling the dishes

504
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:33,478
and fluttering little pieces of paper.

505
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:40,047
But then it moved on to other things.

506
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:49,820
My husband is not a man of God.

507
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:54,494
He pretends to be, but he's not.

508
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:57,560
He brought me over here
to be his wife.

509
00:54:58,761 --> 00:55:00,468
And to bear his child.

510
00:55:01,063 --> 00:55:05,273
Wait... That's... That is his child?

511
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:07,007
Of course.

512
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:10,550
Why would he lock
his own child in that shed?

513
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:11,880
He didn't.

514
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,378
I did.

515
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:18,885
The children in Gatlin,

516
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:24,795
they called it,
"He who walks behind the rows."

517
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:31,867
So it kills a cop
and it keeps us here hostage.

518
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:34,305
For what?
It wants your wife.

519
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:38,507
That means you're the expendable one.

520
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:43,277
Of course, all the men are expendable
once the seeds are sewn.

521
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:48,413
How do you even know any of this?

522
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:51,113
I see things.

523
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:55,524
It puts pictures in my head,
I don't know why.

524
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:57,564
Like what?

525
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:01,761
Like your wife's abortion after
her first pregnancy.

526
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:08,237
It was a miscarriage.
That's what she says to you.

527
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:12,736
I don't believe this. Any of it.

528
00:56:12,801 --> 00:56:16,010
She was unsure.
Of what?

529
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:18,881
Of you.

530
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:23,389
I was trying to protect him
from my husband.

531
00:56:23,445 --> 00:56:25,356
I locked him in a shed.

532
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:28,153
I didn't know what else to do.

533
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:29,130
Call the cops?

534
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:31,528
You saw what he did to that policeman.

535
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,423
Your husband did that?

536
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:36,868
He will blame our son,
but it's not true.

537
00:56:37,326 --> 00:56:40,773
Our son is innocent,
like all children.

538
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:43,773
The evil is in him.

539
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:50,009
You know, I can make the case
that you're behind all of this.

540
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:51,210
You could.

541
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:54,554
And that's the misery of it.

542
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,146
I have to go.

543
00:56:57,813 --> 00:57:00,225
What does this thing want
with my wife?

544
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:03,562
What does it want?

545
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:09,025
It's a seed.

546
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:13,233
A seed that lives inside
of other seeds.

547
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,434
It wants her baby.

548
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:22,214
Why?

549
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:27,516
It lives inside of children,
but children, they grow up.

550
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:30,056
They become adults.

551
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:34,322
And adults can become... unwilling.

552
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:37,130
To what?

553
00:57:37,886 --> 00:57:39,388
To kill.

554
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:45,261
I provide it with whatever it needs,

555
00:57:45,327 --> 00:57:50,367
and what it needs the most
are children.

556
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,375
Little lambs.

557
00:57:55,437 --> 00:58:00,250
To replace those that
were sacrificed to adulthood.

558
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:04,086
Just tell me one thing.
How do we get out of this house?

559
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:06,524
When it's asleep.

560
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:10,428
Great. How do we know if it's asleep?

561
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:13,360
You won't.

562
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:17,666
You'll only know when it's awake.

563
00:58:27,836 --> 00:58:29,873
We don't even know what to watch for.

564
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:31,779
Everything.

565
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:36,049
Don't lean against the door.
Why?

566
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:38,955
I don't know why, just don't do it!

567
00:58:40,082 --> 00:58:41,152
All right.

568
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:58,840
When you had the miscarriage,
it was a miscarriage, right?

569
00:59:00,035 --> 00:59:01,036
Not a...

570
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:06,145
Not what? Not what, Tim?

571
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:10,055
Nothing.

572
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:51,355
It's the delivery guy.

573
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:07,277
Not yet, not yet. Wait.
What?

574
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:54,052
Howdy.

575
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:58,259
Got everything there.

576
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,357
You're about a month early
on that acorn squash,

577
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:02,663
so I had to swap that
out for zucchini.

578
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:05,603
You got your sweet corn,
that's nature's candy.

579
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:06,935
What do you think?
Shh!

580
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:09,532
I got you two little hams
instead of the one big one,

581
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:12,602
but it's about the same weight, so..
Fine, fine.

582
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:16,741
And what's this here?

583
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:19,149
Well, that there is...

584
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:22,884
...something special
for one lucky little boy.

585
01:01:22,944 --> 01:01:26,323
No, no, I did not
order anything for any boy.

586
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,554
It was me.

587
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:48,541
I had something like that
when I was a little boy.

588
01:01:48,603 --> 01:01:50,583
I run that thing into the ground.

589
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:55,588
Gonna need you to do us a favor.

590
01:01:55,644 --> 01:02:00,389
We got a couple of young people
got stranded out here last night.

591
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:02,690
Yeah, I seen the car broke down.

592
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:07,091
Think you could give them a
lift into Burrelson's Garage?

593
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:11,601
Sure, yeah.
That's on my way and everything.

594
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:16,008
Here, let me help you
get this stuff inside, there.

595
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:20,376
Oh, no, everything's fine,
just leave them right where they are.

596
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:23,180
Okey-dokey.

597
01:02:23,238 --> 01:02:26,185
Well, y'all...
Y'all keep a cool stool.

598
01:02:34,883 --> 01:02:37,625
I see you got a visit from
the police, there.

599
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:45,162
None of my business.

600
01:02:45,227 --> 01:02:49,539
Hey, tell your guests I gotta be
rolling in about five minutes.

601
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:50,941
Appreciate it.

602
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:30,679
I don't like this.

603
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:39,782
Hey, y'all, come on over.
I don't bite.

604
01:03:42,184 --> 01:03:45,529
Mr. Pritchett, I'm Tim Gleason,
this is my wife, Allie.

605
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:47,157
It's real nice to meet you.

606
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:51,099
I appreciate you helping us out.
You know what?

607
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:54,706
I know what it's like
to get stuck out in the boonies.

608
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:57,710
I've been stuck out here,
like, 33 years.

609
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:03,855
Here you go.

610
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:06,316
You got room up there for both of us?

611
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:09,082
No, I just...
I barely got room for one,

612
01:04:09,144 --> 01:04:11,454
you're gonna have to
ride in the back, there.

613
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:13,959
I'll get you to Burrelson's
as quick as I can.

614
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:16,586
You know,
before it gets too heated-up.

615
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:21,197
I got some blankets and stuff in here
if it'd make you more comfortable.

616
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,074
Let's go.

617
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:43,354
OK, come on, let's go.

618
01:04:45,814 --> 01:04:48,624
What's wrong?
He left the lights on.

619
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:51,930
Come on, come on, come on.

620
01:04:57,859 --> 01:05:00,601
It's a more comfortable ride,
I'll give you that, but...

621
01:05:01,997 --> 01:05:07,777
...I wouldn't recommend stealing,
or borrowing, a police car.

622
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:10,476
Please. Please.
Please, please, please.

623
01:05:16,778 --> 01:05:17,779
Come on.

624
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:23,221
Go, go, go, go, go!

625
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,042
Hell, I... I reckon that takes care
of our little police problem.

626
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:55,386
Oh, God.

627
01:05:57,786 --> 01:05:59,026
Yes.

628
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:13,306
I brought you something.

629
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:21,415
I hope you like it.

630
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,591
Please don't be angry with me.

631
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,662
I will take you away from all of this.

632
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,692
I promise.

633
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:37,998
Soon, very soon.

634
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,373
Mommy loves you.

635
01:06:51,806 --> 01:06:53,979
Mommy will always love you.

636
01:06:57,345 --> 01:06:59,325
No matter what.

637
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:10,595
What really happened back there?

638
01:07:10,658 --> 01:07:13,264
I mean, taking away
all the he said, she said?

639
01:07:13,328 --> 01:07:14,773
It was some kind of a cult.

640
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:18,208
And that kid, if he's even a kid
at all, is at the center of it.

641
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:25,078
What if he's just an innocent child?

642
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:28,212
Then he'll be taken away from those
freaks and given to a good home.

643
01:07:56,137 --> 01:07:58,139
One thing seems pretty clear.

644
01:07:58,873 --> 01:08:03,344
Whoever, or whatever did all that,
was playing with our perceptions,

645
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:05,254
getting inside our heads.
Yeah.

646
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:06,724
So, I have to admit

647
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:10,092
it's got me wondering now
just what was real back there

648
01:08:10,151 --> 01:08:12,222
and what wasn't.

649
01:08:14,422 --> 01:08:17,426
Including what really went on
between you and Helen.

650
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:21,463
Come on, when Preacher said
what he said, he was baiting me.

651
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:24,305
He knows his wife,
he knows what she's capable of.

652
01:08:24,365 --> 01:08:25,708
He doesn't know me.

653
01:08:32,474 --> 01:08:35,148
OK. You're forgiven.

654
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:39,556
Forgiven? I didn't do anything!
Forgiven just in case you did.

655
01:08:41,316 --> 01:08:42,818
I think I can live with that.

656
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:07,577
Honey, I don't like the looks of that.

657
01:09:07,642 --> 01:09:09,883
Yeah, that top one
seems loose, doesn't it?

658
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:12,015
Yeah, speed up and go around it.

659
01:09:13,848 --> 01:09:16,692
Wait, no. Just slow down
and let it get ahead of you.

660
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:19,231
Make up your mind.
Slower.

661
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:22,032
Wait, never mind. You know,
it looks like it's gonna hold.

662
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:24,366
For Chrissakes, Allie!
I'm sorry, I don't like it!

663
01:09:24,425 --> 01:09:25,927
Just go around it!

664
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,401
What are you doing?

665
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:35,914
You wanted me to go around it, I'm
making sure it gets out of the way.

666
01:09:42,043 --> 01:09:43,716
Oh, my God, Tim, look out!

667
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:45,380
Oh, my God!
Ahh!

668
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:51,119
Oh, my God!
Hold on.

669
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:52,529
Come on!

670
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:56,161
Be careful! Oh, my God!

671
01:09:56,891 --> 01:09:58,802
Ahhh!
Watch out!

672
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:04,133
What is going on?
Tim, I love you.

673
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:53,014
Tim.

674
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:55,350
Tim?

675
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,492
No...

676
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:07,331
No...

677
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:23,648
Poor thing.

678
01:11:25,113 --> 01:11:27,855
Got yourself in quite
a pickle here, don't you?

679
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:33,124
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'll get you fixed up good as new.

680
01:11:34,455 --> 01:11:36,298
I'm sorry about your hubby.

681
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:40,929
Looks like he's in
the arms of Jesus now.

682
01:12:43,991 --> 01:12:45,402
Here we go.

683
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:47,695
Come on.

684
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:09,284
There she is.

685
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:12,920
Little worse for the wear, but...

686
01:13:13,821 --> 01:13:15,528
...she's still pretty as a peach.

687
01:13:16,791 --> 01:13:21,069
I don't know how you do it. Each one
of them's sweeter than the last.

688
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:24,167
Whoever receives the child...

689
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:25,973
Do not despise the little ones,
for they are...

690
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:29,503
Blessed children do not
follow the rules of their fathers...

691
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:34,047
And a child shall lead them.
