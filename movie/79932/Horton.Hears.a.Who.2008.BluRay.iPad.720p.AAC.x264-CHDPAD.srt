2
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:10,921
耶!
Yeah!

3
00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:14,057
五月十五这一天 在丛林里的某个角落
On the 15th of May, in the jungle of Nool,

4
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:17,433
夏日炎炎，在清凉的水池里
in the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool,

5
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,940
大象荷顿正在玩水 享受丛林生活最棒的时刻
he was splashing, enjoying the jungle's great joys,

6
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:27,769
这时他突然听到一个细微的声音
when Horton the Elephant heard a small noise.

7
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:39,791
-荷顿! -荷顿!
- Horton! - Horton!

8
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:42,694
早，同学们，准备上课了？
Good morning, class. Are you ready?

9
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:44,923
-对! -那就上来吧!
- Yeah! - Jump on board!

10
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,528
下面的注意!
Look out below!

11
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,433
汤米上来了，凯蒂，你呢？
Tommy's on board. Katie, you there?

12
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,897
很好
Okay.

13
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,244
就是那个
There it is.

14
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:03,510
这是丛林里最奇特的生物之一 拟叶虫
This is one of the jungle's most amazing creatures, the leaf bug.

15
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:08,280
为了让自己不被掠食者嗑掉 它们会伪装成一片片的叶子
In order to protect itself from predators, it disguises itself as a leaf.

16
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:17,426
这个小家伙有点固执 来吧，小家伙
This one's got quite a grip. Come on, little buddy.

17
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,192
别害羞嘛
Don't be shy.

18
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:24,033
我想我可能弄错了
I guess I was mistaken, kids.

19
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:27,662
很明显地，这里根本没有拟叶虫
There are obviously no leaf bugs in this area. Even if...

20
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:29,742
它们在我身上!
No, they're on me!

21
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,606
我好像吸到一只了!
I think I swallowed one!

22
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,807
汤米!把它抓出来!
Tommy! Pull it out!

23
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,546
好吧
Uh, okay.

24
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,560
哼哼叫的是只坏脾气的袋鼠
Then humpfing a '"humpf'" was a sour Kangaroo,

25
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,687
她自以为自己无所不知
the type who's convinced she knows better than you.

26
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,961
她制订规矩也执行法律
She made every law and enforced every rule

27
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:58,299
以努尔森林的领导者自居
as self-proclaimed head of the jungle of Nool.

28
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,604
为什么我不能和其他小孩玩？
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?

29
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:03,164
我说过，在丛林里
How many times have I told you that

30
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:06,508
言行绝不能像只野生动物
the jungle is no place to act like a wild animal.

31
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,814
那个叫荷顿的还真是个怪胎
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.

32
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:22,794
孩子们从他身上学到很多东西
And the children are learning so much from him.

33
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:26,059
学会怎么变成一群愚蠢的笨蛋!
Learning to be a bunch of harebrained half-wits!

34
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,234
所以我的小袋鼠都由我亲自教育
And that's why my Rudy is pouch-schooled.

35
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:32,366
就在袋鼠妈妈冷嘲热讽的时候…
So while Kangaroo stood there, sneering a sneer...

36
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,440
荷顿，今天真是太精采了!
Horton, that was the best time I've ever had in my life!

37
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,297
你下次要带我们看什么？
What are you gonna show us next?

38
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:40,210
…那粒小灰尘再度飞过荷顿的耳旁
...once again, the speck floated right by Horton's ear.

39
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:44,415
他又听到一个极为细小的声音
Then he heard it again, just a very faint yelp,

40
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,985
听来像是个很小的生物在求救
as if some tiny person were calling for help.

41
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:52,122
你知道他怎么想吗？
And you know what he thought?

42
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,022
他认为在那一粒小小的微尘上
Why, he thought that there must be someone

43
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:56,994
一定有人!
on top of that small speck of dust!

44
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,395
或许是一家人，很有可能
Or even a family, it just might be so,

45
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:02,229
一个有几个孩子要养的家庭
a family with children just starting to grow.

46
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,330
我想活下去!
I want to live!

47
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,772
我先闪 了，凯蒂，换你接手!
I gotta go. Katie, you're in charge!

48
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,346
等一等!
Wait!

49
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,510
-回来! -小心点!
- Come back! - Watch it!

50
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:47,940
再一根!再一根!再一根!
One more! One more! One more!

51
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,918
-我听见有人靠近! -香蕉给我!
- I hear someone coming! - Give me those!

52
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:00,421
-等一等! -快拉警报!
- Wait! - Sound the alarm!

53
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,362
原谅我的大象腿!
Excuse me. Pardon my stampede!

54
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:10,625
抱歉，猴子家族 我等一下会来帮忙整理!
Sorry, Wickershams! I promise I'm gonna clean all this up later!

55
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,637
把弹药拿来!
Bring the ammo!

56
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:23,905
早晨的香蕉味让我心旷神怡
I love the smell of bananas in the morning.

57
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:27,286
香蕉炸弹发射!
Banana in the hole!

58
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:30,412
别这样!我们都是哺乳类耶!
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

59
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:36,761
我想外交策略完全没用
I feel the diplomatic process is beginning to break down.

60
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,228
你在这里，我接住你了!
There you are! I got you!

61
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,638
你好，孩子们
Hi, kids!

62
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,573
好险
Wow.

63
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,712
好了
There.

64
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:05,189
这下你安全了
Now you're safe.

65
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,450
我确定我听到你说了些什么 我很确定
I know I heard you say something. I just know it.

66
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:13,060
你在哪里？
Where are you?

67
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:21,798
荷顿!
Horton!

68
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:23,501
对不起
Sorry!

69
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:29,180
都是这粒小灰尘啦! 它向我求救
I just... There was this speck, and it called out for help.

70
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:31,876
-我就… -这粒小灰尘向你求救？
- And I was... - The speck called out for help?

71
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:35,351
不是灰尘在求救啦，那太扯了
Well, not the speck. I mean, that's ridiculous.

72
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,491
你以为我是那个意思喔？ 灰尘怎么可能会求救
Is that what you thought I meant? No, the speck can't call out for help.

73
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:42,788
拜托，别闹了
Come on, get real.

74
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:48,131
是灰尘上的小小人需要我帮助
No, there's a tiny person on that speck that needs my help.

75
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:52,293
乱讲，根本没有那么小的人!
Absurd. There aren't people that small!

76
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,870
可能并不是他们小
Well, maybe they aren't small.

77
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:57,640
-也许是我们比较大 -荷顿
- Maybe we're big. - Horton.

78
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,170
仔细想想，要是真有人正在那上面
No, really, think about it. What if there was someone way out there

79
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,147
低头看着我们的世界
looking down on our world right now?

80
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,516
对他们来说，我们就是灰尘
And to them, we're the specks.

81
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:09,516
这时有人说
And then, maybe someone else will come along and say,

82
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:12,056
“根本没那么小的人” 第一个人就说
"Oh, there can't be people that small", and the first guy would say,

83
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,387
“你是说我说谎？”
"Are you calling me a liar?"

84
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:15,984
另一人就说：“敢说谎就要承认”
And the second guy would say, "If the shoe fits, wear it!"

85
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,530
接着两个人打了起来
And now the fists are flying, and the first guy picks up a brick,

86
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:21,327
接下来的对话小孩子不大适合听
and you might want to zip up the pouch for this next part.

87
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,265
“死胖子，你欠揍吗？”
"All right, fat boy, you want some of this..."

88
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:24,564
-荷顿! -怎样？
- Horton! - What?

89
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:27,003
那粒灰尘上什么都没有
There is nothing on that speck.

90
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:30,339
-可是我听到了 -你有吗？
- But I heard. - Did you?

91
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,741
真的？天哪
Really? Oh, my.

92
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,841
那为什么我什么也没听到？
Then how come I don't hear anything?

93
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,444
这个嘛…
Well...

94
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:43,485
看不到、听不到或感觉不到
If you can't see, hear or feel something,

95
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:45,285
那东西就绝对不存在
it doesn't exist.

96
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:48,418
还有相信那些幻想出来的小小人
And believing in tiny, imaginary people

97
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:52,726
在努尔森林这个地方
is just not something we do or tolerate,

98
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:54,823
是我们不该做，也不会容忍的事
here in the jungle of Nool.

99
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:59,361
是吗？可是我敢说只要我去试 我一定可以找到
Really? Because I bet if I really tried, I could find somebody who'd believe

100
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,167
-愿意相信的人 -你什么也不许做
- what I've been saying. - You will do nothing of the sort.

101
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,337
不准你对任何人说这无聊的谎言 特别是对小孩子
You will not breathe a word of this lie to anyone else, especially the children.

102
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:10,246
不准用这些谎言毒害他们的心灵
I do not want you poisoning their minds with this nonsense.

103
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:13,742
我们的社区可是有规范的，荷顿
Our community has standards, Horton.

104
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:17,949
如果你还想继续待下去 我劝你还是遵守规范
If you want to remain a part of it, I recommend you follow them.

105
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,459
祝你今天愉快
Have a nice day.

106
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:28,264
好吧，我会好好思考你说的话
All right, then, I'll take that under advisement.

107
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,925
十分感激你的建议
Certainly appreciate your input.

108
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:36,039
真搞不懂，我明明就有听到啊
I don't understand. I know I heard you.

109
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,073
声音很明显从我面前飘过去
It was as plain as the nose on my face.

110
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:42,504
对了，也许你听不到我
That's it. Maybe you can't hear me.

111
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:47,618
当然啦，你们的耳朵一定也很小 所以我要大声点
Of course! Your ears must be tiny. I need to speak up.

112
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:53,355
哈!
Hello!

113
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:56,088
有些动物…我想我知道有谁
Now some people out there, I think I know who,

114
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,221
或许也会认同刻薄的袋鼠妈妈
may find they agree with that sour Kangaroo.

115
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,198
认为不可能有跟虱子一样小的人
'"There can't really be people as small as a mite. '"

116
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,070
或许有可能…真的有… 因为荷顿说对了
Well, there can, and there are, because Horton was right.

117
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,449
哈!
Hello!

118
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,085
这一声“哈”一路传下来
That single '"hello'" traveled all the way down

119
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:30,390
进入灰尘，穿过了云层 直到传到了这座小镇
to the speck, through the clouds, until it found a small town.

120
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:34,226
这里叫呼呼镇，呼呼族就住这
A town known as Whoville, for there lived the Whos,

121
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,633
平安快乐过活，只知道好消息
feeling happy and safe, knowing only good news,

122
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:41,264
不知道自己的世界只是一粒灰尘
unaware that their world was a speck on a clover,

123
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,400
也没发现快乐的生活正面临危险
unaware that the sweet life they knew might be over.

124
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,445
-跳过! -钻过!
- Over! - Under!

125
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,807
呼呼镇的镇长名叫麦克当奈德
The Mayor of Whoville, a man named McDodd,

126
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,512
做事认真又正直，只是有点无厘头
was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.

127
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:16,130
镇长夫妇有一群孩子要照顾
The Mayor and his wife, they had children to spare,

128
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:19,643
九十六个女儿 有些坐在这里、有些坐在那里
96 daughters, some here and some there.

129
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,413
有九十六个女儿要爱 有九十六个女儿要教
96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach,

130
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,781
不过镇长只能给每个女儿几秒钟
but the Mayor had only a few seconds for each.

131
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,690
爸爸!我呼呼族历史考试满分
Daddy, I got better than best on my Who-story test.

132
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,919
呼呼族历史，我最熟了
Who-story. I remember it well.

133
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,552
真是我的好女儿
That's one of my girls.

134
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,826
-海达偷用我的梳子! -荷莉才偷用我的梳子!
- Hildy's been using my hairbrush! - Holly's been using my hairbrush!

135
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,695
快看那边!
Look! Over there!

136
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,226
好多了
There. All better.

137
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:48,034
能帮我买一支呼呼手机吗？ 我们班上每一个同学都有
Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad? Everyone else in my class has one.

138
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,108
是吗？每个都有？
Oh, really? Everyone?

139
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,702
我会好好考虑的
I will think about it.

140
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,941
爸，快看!爸，快看!
Daddy, look! Daddy, look!

141
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:02,813
牙“此”
Toof.

142
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:04,822
是牙“齿”，亲爱的，要陨
It's a "T-H", sweetheart. It's "tooth."

143
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,882
呼呼族的传统，和你我的不同
In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,

144
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:10,689
他们镇长的职位由长子代代相传
the Mayor's oldest is next in the Mayoral line.

145
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,196
谁是长子？接下这家的棒子？
And who was the oldest? To lead and stand tall?

146
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,462
乔乔，他儿子，最矮小的一个
It was JoJo, his son, the smallest Who of all.

147
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:21,666
说吧，乔乔，你今天好不好？ 发生了什么事？有什么新闻？
So, JoJo, what's shaking? What's happening? What's the word?

148
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:25,203
相信现在你我都非常清楚
Now, to you or to me, it's abundantly clear

149
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,371
乔乔根本不想接他父亲的职务
that JoJo did not want his father's career.

150
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:32,214
只见镇长一情愿的构思计划
But the Mayor pressed forward, completely deluded,

151
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,820
乔乔却若有所思的坐在那里
while JoJo just sat there in silence and brooded.

152
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,087
乔乔!
Oh, JoJo!

153
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,521
-为什么他的时间比较长？ -不公平
- Hey, why does he get more time? - That's not fair.

154
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,032
儿子!
Son! Hey!

155
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,624
他为什么不说话呢？
And why didn't he speak?

156
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:54,469
我想他是怕说了会让他爸难过
Well, I think that the lad was afraid if he did, he might let down his dad.

157
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,775
你知道什么最正点吗？
You know what's awesome?

158
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,707
这些就很正点
This is awesome.

159
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:03,339
看看这些墙壁上的祖先肖像
Just look at the men and women hanging on these walls.

160
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:09,348
你，乖儿子 你是百年家族杰出菁英的一份子
You, my boy, are part of a family legacy that spans centuries.

161
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:14,586
知道吗？你爷爷曾是呼呼镇镇长
You know what? Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville,

162
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:20,264
还有你的曾曾祖母，没有错
and your great-grandmother, that's right,

163
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,327
现在来看看这一路
all the way down to your

164
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,037
伟大的…伟大的…伟大的… 没那么伟大的
great-great-great-great-not-so-great-

165
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:33,442
伟大的…伟大的…伟大的 曾曾曾…
great-great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-great-

166
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,139
祖父
grandfather.

167
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,683
我希望有一天能加入他们
Someday I hope to join them.

168
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:44,385
成为家族的伟大菁英之一
Be one of the greats.

169
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:48,917
我告诉你，乔乔 没有比当镇长更赞的了
I tell you, JoJo, there is nothing like being Mayor.

170
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:52,896
镇长能签署决议案 批准法条、核准预算
I get to sign resolutions, approve ordinances, submit budgets,

171
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:57,732
而且在美食嘉年华会上 超级大肉丸上坐的一定是镇长
and in the Edible Parade, I'm the one sitting on top of the giant meatball.

172
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:03,232
有一天坐在上面的也会是你
Someday, that can be you, too, JoJo.

173
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:08,440
有一天你也会别上镇长徽章
Someday you'll be the one wearing the Mayoral Crest.

174
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,380
你只要…你只需要…
You just... You just need to...

175
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,788
你懂我的意思吗？
You know what I mean?

176
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,647
好吧，聊天愉快
Okay. Good chat.

177
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:24,055
我很高兴我们谈了这么多
I'm glad that we had this talk

178
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:29,267
接下来我就讲给自己听吧，也好
that I'm continuing now by myself. Good.

179
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:38,907
好了，很舒服吧
There. That ought to be comfy.

180
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:47,252
不要放在心上，摩登 一点也不用担心
Nothing wrong with this, Morton. Nothing wrong with this.

181
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,219
只有你我和小灰尘，一起聊天
Just you, me and the speck, shooting the breeze.

182
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:56,925
我们同国的 高兴的话，还可以办个公投
We're a club. We're a group. We can take a vote on the issues.

183
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:01,057
也能搞秘密组织，维护世界和平
We can be a secret society that controls the balance of power in the world.

184
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,600
-荷顿 -谁都不能加入
- Horton. - And no one else can join,

185
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,932
除非他头戴怪帽
unless they wear funny hats.

186
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,901
荷顿，听好!
Listen, Horton!

187
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,499
我的兄弟摩登是当然会员
The Chair recognizes Brother Morton.

188
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,137
我很高兴你找到这个小灰尘
I am really happy you found this speck and all,

189
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:20,179
不过你最好不要让别人知道此事
but you might want to think about keeping it to yourself.

190
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:22,754
什么？为什么？
What? Why?

191
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,817
因为你对着一支花讲话 正常人不会这样
Well, you're talking to a clover. That doesn't look good.

192
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,386
你知道有问题的是谁？
You know what doesn't look good?

193
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:34,660
你的口气好像这灰尘完全不存在
You talking about the speck like the speck isn't even there.

194
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:37,702
人家可没有在你背后说你坏话
The speck never said anything bad about you.

195
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:40,863
不过这显现了你的幻想力很强
But, hey! Good luck with your illusion of superiority.

196
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:45,501
它爱怎么想我随便它 它只是一粒灰尘
You know, the speck can think anything it wants about me. It's a speck.

197
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,777
我知道你在不爽什么了
I see what's going on here.

198
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:53,484
摩登，不管我和这粒灰尘多要好
Morton, no matter how tight the speck and I get,

199
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,446
它永远也取代不了你
the speck could never replace you.

200
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:00,020
我以为我不用解释你就会明白
I'm only sad that I would have to explain that, at this point.

201
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,856
你真够朋友，荷顿 谢谢你的安慰
Well, that's awesome, Horton. That really helps.

202
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:07,322
别把秘密告诉别人
Just try to keep this to yourself.

203
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,828
待会儿见吧，别乱说话
I'll see you later. Try.

204
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,398
荷顿，你手上拿的是什么？
Hey, Horton! What you got there?

205
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:19,341
什么？哪有？
What? Nothing!

206
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,538
我们什么也没做啊!
We're not doing anything.

207
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,948
-我们没有…根本没人？ -“我们”是谁？
- We're totally alone. - Who's "we"?

208
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,383
什么？我们？我刚有说吗？
"We"? What? "We"? Did I say that? I just... Oh.

209
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,181
没，那样说就代表我和谁在一起
No, I would never say that, because that would imply that

210
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:31,814
不是只有一个人
I was with someone, and not alone.

211
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:40,859
我说真的，这绝对不能说出去
Okay, seriously, you can't tell anybody. I mean it.

212
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:44,868
要是这秘密被人发现 事情会变得非常非常糟
If anybody finds out about this, it could be very, very bad.

213
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,899
我也不大明白是为什么
I'm not sure why.

214
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,639
我们绝对不会说
We won't tell anyone.

215
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,405
要是我们说了 我们也会叫他们不要跟别人说
And if we do, we'll tell them not to tell anyone.

216
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:55,513
太好了
Perfect!

217
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,105
好，我本来正在洗澡
Okay, I'm taking a bath, right,

218
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,241
因为我的肤质偏干…
'cause my skin gets kind of dry and a little bit ashy.

219
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:02,081
当荷顿详细说明他如何找到灰尘
While Horton came clean about the speck that he'd found

220
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,417
与如何拯救它免于被淹没命运时
and how he had saved it when it nearly drowned,

221
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,287
镇长也正好准备出发去上班
the Mayor set off on his morning commute

222
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:09,589
虽然他发现好像有点怪怪的
and noticed things weren't quite the same on his route.

223
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:14,098
但是请别怪罪荷顿 他根本不知道，上面一个小碰撞…
But please don't blame Horton, for he didn't know that a small bump above...

224
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,190
…我就往水里跳下去
...and I dove in the water like this!

225
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,931
…会造成下面的大地震
...was a big bump below.

226
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,671
阿乔，不要太拼命了
Hey, Joe, don't work too hard.

227
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:27,007
豪华地宝又不会自己盖好
These luxury condos, they don't build themselves.

228
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:34,116
真的假的!它自己盖好了耶!
Hey, look at that! I guess they do build themselves.

229
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,619
好吧，那也没什么
Okay, that happened.

230
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,617
镇长知道他负责的工作 就是要报告每天发现的异状
Now, the Mayor knew it was his job to convey the unusual things

231
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:47,256
不过问题是
that he'd noticed that day, but there was one problem.

232
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,197
虽然他有强烈预感…
Though his will was strong...

233
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:51,202
-你迟到了 -麻烦你了，叶波小姐
- You're late. - Thank you, Miss Yelp.

234
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,803
…但是呼呼镇看来一切都很正常
...nothing in Whoville had ever gone wrong.

235
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:58,240
该有的我们都有
We have all that we need. We need all that we've got.

236
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,474
我们都爱呼呼镇，住了不想走
We like it in Whoville. We like it a lot!

237
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:06,449
大家都忙着准备 呼呼镇即将到来的百年庆
We're all very busy with the Who-Centennial coming up,

238
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:09,248
所以请遵照会议程序进行
so let's bring this meeting to order.

239
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:12,816
镇长先生，我想你有好消息要说
Mr. Mayor, I presume you have some good news for us.

240
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:13,983
好消息
Well, it's news.

241
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,452
是有个消息啦

242
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:21,090
我不知道这件事情 到底算是好消息还是坏消息
I don't know if we need to go labeling it "good" or "bad" or anything like that.

243
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:26,399
事情就是… 我发现镇上出现了一些怪现象
The thing is, I have noticed some odd goings-on in Whoville lately.

244
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:28,440
是好的怪现象吗？
Good "odd goings-on"?

245
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:32,271
这个嘛…地震、天上旋转的云
Well, you know, tremors, clouds swirling in the sky.

246
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,175
在我看来，为了安全起见
And it seems to me, just to be safe,

247
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:37,147
也许可以考虑延后呼呼镇百年庆
we might want to consider postponing the Who-Centennial.

248
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:39,012
考虑什么？
Consider what?

249
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,683
腌后虎虎百年青
Postponing the Who-Centennial.

250
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:42,084
什么？腌后虎虎百年青
What? Speak up, man!

251
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,985
大声一点!

252
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:48,192
延后呼呼镇百年庆!可以吗？
Postponing the Who-Centennial! All right?

253
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:13,850
全体镇民正忙着庆祝 呼呼镇百年来幸福和谐的日子
We are about to celebrate 100 years of Whoville happiness and harmony,

254
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,147
而你竟然想延后这场活动？
and you want to postpone the celebration?

255
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,813
要是呼呼镇不安全呢？
Well, what if Whoville's not safe?

256
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,882
呼呼镇从来没有出过差错
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville,

257
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:25,487
从前没有，未来也不会有 你这个乱七八糟的笨蛋
never has and never will, you blathering boob!

258
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,069
呼呼镇百年庆照计划进行
The Who-Centennial will proceed as planned!

259
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,404
镇长只是一时短路秀逗
The Mayor was merely being an idiot.

260
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:40,410
从现在起请记得笑口常开
It will be all smiles from now on.

261
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:45,377
噢!噢!会痛!
That hurt!

262
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,849
小姐，我的点阅率早破百万了
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.

263
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,822
什么叫照片不像？
What? What do you mean, it don't look like me?

264
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,520
那照片绝对是我! 十年前的我，等等，你先别挂
That looks just like me 10 years ago. Wait a minute. Hold on for a second.

265
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,859
居然说我是笨蛋，我才不是笨蛋
Treats me like an idiot. I am not an idiot.

266
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,263
我看起来像笨蛋吗？
Do I look like an idiot?

267
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,835
-你不会想听到答案的 -我不是笨蛋
- You don't want me to answer that. - I am not an idiot.

268
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:17,075
竟敢叫我笨蛋？ 我不会骂人是笨蛋
Has the nerve to call me a boob? I would never call somebody a boob.

269
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,343
他才是笨蛋，你看看你
He's a boob! Look at you.

270
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,319
恶心!
Yuck!

271
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,286
看到你那张脸
Look at your face.

272
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:27,448
我让你尝尝被叮满头包的滋味
And I bet you don't look so good with a stapler in your head!

273
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,369
哗!哗
Whoa! Whoa.

274
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,805
-谢了，叶波小姐 -别客气
- Thank you, Miss Yelp. - You're welcome.

275
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:48,470
哈？
Hello?

276
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:52,380
走开!不然我揍扁你!
Who said that? Back off! I'll punch you!

277
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:03,219
哈？
Hello?

278
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:07,591
哈
Hello.

279
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:16,636
你是谁啊？
Who's there?

280
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:17,933
我是镇长
This is the Mayor.

281
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,771
镇长？镇长!
The Mayor? The Mayor!

282
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,707
我在跟镇长说话耶!
I'm talking to the Mayor!

283
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:28,978
我就知道 我就知道有人住在这粒灰尘里
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew there was life on this speck.

284
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:31,313
灰尘？什么灰尘啊？
"This speck"? What speck?

285
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:36,157
我不大知道该怎么告诉你，但是…
Well, I don't exactly know how to tell you this, but...

286
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:39,720
你住在一粒灰尘里
You're living on a speck.

287
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,428
不是我想吐你槽啦! 排水管里的老兄
Well, I hate to disagree with you, O voice from the drainpipe,

288
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,494
但是我住在呼呼镇
but I live in Whoville.

289
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:49,100
那呼呼镇就是一粒灰尘
Well, then, Whoville's a speck.

290
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,232
才怪
Right.

291
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,142
不要闹了，你到底是谁？
Okay, seriously, who is this?

292
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:55,076
你是会计部的伯特？
Is this Burt from accounting?

293
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:59,116
错，我叫荷顿，我是只大象
No. This is Horton. I'm an elephant.

294
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:02,515
好吧，荷顿
Okay, "Horton."

295
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,919
真爱演，你在哪啊？
Fake name. Where are you?

296
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,326
从你站的位置来看 我猜我是…在天空上吧？
Well, from where you're standing, I guess I'm in the sky.

297
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:12,528
跟你比起来，我超大的
Compared to you, I'm enormous.

298
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:15,157
不过我已经瘦了很多
Which is saying something, because I've slimmed down quite a bit.

299
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,894
我游泳
I swim.

300
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:21,267
你的世界就在我们的一朵花上
Your whole world fits on a flower in my world.

301
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,304
伯特，你讲的冷笑话比我还冷
Oh, man, this is even pushing it for you, Burt.

302
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:27,512
看我把你放在阴影下会怎样？
Don't believe me? Watch what happens when I put you in the shade.

303
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,842
根本就不会怎样…
This is absolutely impossible...

304
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:31,506
天黑
Dark.

305
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:33,607
天亮
Light.

306
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,243
天黑
Dark.

307
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:38,845
天亮、天黑、天亮、天黑
Light. Dark, light, dark, light, dark, light, dark.

308
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:41,550
天亮
Light!

309
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,152
看到没？
Don't you see?

310
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:47,992
我们在神奇的机缘巧合中相遇
We're in the middle of some kind of amazing cosmic convergence.

311
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:52,865
两个完全不同的世界 出乎意料交会在一起
Two vastly different worlds, miraculously crossing paths!

312
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:55,663
我这边有够大，你那边有够小
Mine, colossal! Yours, miniscule.

313
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,539
而我们居然能搭上线
Yet somehow we've managed to make contact.

314
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:01,736
仔细想想，这真的很神奇
If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.

315
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,715
你们那边都没事吧？
Is everything okay down there?

316
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:13,248
你说咧？我们的世界在你手上!
I don't know. You tell me. You're the one holding the speck.

317
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,558
你们的世界在我手上
I'm the one holding the speck.

318
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:18,519
你们的世界在我手上
I'm the one holding the speck.

319
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,258
你不用担心，镇长先生
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

320
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,026
先等我一下
Hold, please!

321
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:29,866
这是怎么回事？镇长一头雾水
What did all of this mean? The Mayor hadn't a clue.

322
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:35,345
所以他跑进拉鲁博士的办公室 她是呼呼大学里最聪明的博士
So he ran to the office of Dr. Larue, the brainiest brain on the staff at Who U.

323
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:37,177
拉鲁博士!
Dr. Larue!

324
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,380
我大概是疯了
This is crazy.

325
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:42,147
镇长先生
Mr. Mayor.

326
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:44,949
有什么需要我服务吗？
How may I be of assistance?

327
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:47,514
我不知道，我想问你一件事
I don't know. Hey, you know, I was just wondering

328
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:52,359
如果我们的世界 是一粒飘在空中的小灰尘
if our world were, say, a tiny speck floating through space,

329
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:53,489
我们怎么知道？
how would we know?

330
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:55,328
为什么你会问这种问题？
Well, why would you ask something like that?

331
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,597
没事，我都忘记我问什么了
No reason. No reason at all. I don't even remember.

332
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:00,762
对，我是问了
Yes, I do. You know what?

333
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:02,840
其实是有人告诉我的
Some guy was talking to me.

334
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:05,706
不是什么天空里的大象，是邻居
Not an elephant in the sky. A guy on the ground.

335
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:08,143
本来就有成千上万种可能
There would be several ramifications.

336
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:10,271
是好的“可能”吗？
Good ramifications?

337
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,816
一粒小灰尘？
A tiny speck?

338
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,147
对，小灰尘
Yeah. Tiny speck.

339
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,915
飘来飘去
Floating around.

340
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:23,318
最近是有一些无预警的地震 气候上也有不寻常的变化
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors, dramatic changes in the weather,

341
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:27,829
如果我们没办法稳定这个世界
and if we didn't eventually achieve some sort of stability,

342
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:31,425
我们可能就会面临…世界末日!
our world would be destroyed!

343
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,303
世界末日？世界末日
Destroyed? Destroyed. Oh, destroyed.

344
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:42,444
荷顿!
Horton!

345
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:44,948
不，我是…阿宝
No, this is Benny.

346
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:48,152
荷顿他现在正在忙
Horton is busy right now.

347
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,154
开玩笑的啦!
No. I'm joking.

348
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:52,049
我在这
That's me.

349
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:53,924
我们完了
We're doomed.

350
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:58,122
荷顿，我想我需要你帮点小忙
Listen, Horton, turns out I need your help a little bit.

351
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:00,528
很明显地，要是这粒小灰尘乱飞
Apparently, if that speck keeps moving around,

352
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,295
我们的世界可能就会毁灭
our whole world could be obliterated.

353
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:09,001
所以我需要你帮我们找一个 更安全更稳定的新家
So I need you to find us Whos a safer, more stable home,

354
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:10,165
要快
and fast.

355
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,371
没问题，镇长先生，我看看…
No problem, Mr. Mayor. Let's see...

356
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,442
那里视野真好
Wow, that's a nice view.

357
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:23,044
一切都没问题吧？
Hello. Is everything okay?

358
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:33,988
上面怎么了？
What's going on up there?

359
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:51,940
这里简直是生死一瞬间现场版!
This entire jungle is a house of death!

360
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,183
等等，那里看来不错
Oh, wait. There's a good spot.

361
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,785
就在此时，荷顿看到努尔山顶
And it's then Horton saw at the top of Mount Nool,

362
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:02,122
有个看来宁静祥和又酷的小山洞
a small cave that looked peaceful and quiet and cool,

363
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:05,288
一朵向日葵高高盛开在洞穴里
where a sunflower grew proud and tall from the ground.

364
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:09,527
他知道呼呼族到了那里 绝对会平安无事
There, he knew every Who would be safe, would be sound.

365
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:13,001
我找到了，镇长，最完美的地点
I found it, Mayor. The perfect place.

366
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,200
就在那上面
Right up there,

367
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,570
-那座山顶上 -镇长先生
- on the top of Mount Nool. - Mr. Mayor?

368
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,710
我希望你能…
I wish you could...

369
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:23,006
亮晶晶
Shiny.

370
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,579
呼呼镇百年庆委员会正在等你
The Who-Centennial Committee is waiting for you

371
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,814
勘验美食游行要用的超级肉丸
to look over the giant meatball for the Edible Parade.

372
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:32,721
接着你要找牙医做呼呼根管治疗
And then you're due at the dentist for your Who-root canal.

373
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:37,022
在根管治疗前加上呼呼的名号 治疗时并不会比较舒服
You know, sticking "Who" in front of everything doesn't make it hurt less.

374
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:39,029
那是浪费时间
Just wastes time!

375
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:40,928
我才不要去
I don't want to go.

376
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,095
荷顿，我先走了
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go.

377
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,364
我得先去处理那颗超级大肉丸
Apparently, there's a problem with the giant meatball.

378
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:52,234
您尽管去处理那颗肉丸吧 这件特殊的任务就交给我
You just take care of that meatball, sir, and leave the freaking out to me.

379
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:55,245
荷顿展开危机重重的长途旅程
So then Horton began his long, perilous trek,

380
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,612
他决心拯救灰尘上的小小世界
determined to save the small world on the speck.

381
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:02,111
荷顿抱着坚定信念与仁慈的心
Horton was faithful and stalwart and kind.

382
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,687
我抓好你了
I got you.

383
00:26:03,755 --> 00:26:05,689
他是无惧的勇士…
He was a brave hero...

384
00:26:05,757 --> 00:26:06,815
我会保护你
I'll protect you!

385
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:08,290
…至少他心里是这么想的
...at least in his mind.

386
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,954
我们得小心谨慎，悄悄的前进
We must become invisible. Travel silently.

387
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:13,895
因为敌人搞不好正要暗算我们
For there are forces that would seek to destroy us.

388
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:17,091
(尖叫)

389
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:23,306
你以为你偷袭得了我？
So you think you can sneak up on me, huh?

390
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:28,443
显然你的功夫跟我差远了
It is clear that you are no match for my technique.

391
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,570
(痛)

392
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:35,277
你还真会用暗器来偷袭啊 看我的前空翻!
I see you have mastered the way of the snapping branch. Watch me tumble!

393
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,320
飞天鼠摩登!
Morton Mouse, go!

394
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,325
荷顿，真俐落 可是袋鼠妈妈有猴子军团
You are fast, Horton, but the Kangaroo has monkeys.

395
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:45,226
我会好好教训这群臭猴子 这是我们的使命
I will make monkeys of these monkeys. It is their destiny.

396
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,193
象派气功!
More clover!

397
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,625
荷顿是全世界最伟大的英雄!
Horton is the greatest hero of them all!

398
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:52,829
-荷顿! -摩登!
- Horton! - Morton!

399
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:54,462
上!
Go!

400
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,572
但是努尔山在那边
But Mount Nool is that way.

401
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:02,977
朝努尔山顶前进!快如闪 电!
To the top of Mount Nool! As fast as lightning! Away, I go.

402
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:07,183
抱歉，小家伙
Sorry, little fellow.

403
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,782
你不会有事的 只要专心冥想自己恢复健康
You'll be fine. Just think healing thoughts.

404
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:17,427
-荷顿!荷顿! -荷顿!你看，你看!
- Horton! Look! - Horton! Look, look, look!

405
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,492
我们全都有载着小世界的苜蓿花
We've all got our own clovers with worlds on them!

406
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,089
对
Yeah.

407
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,530
我的小世界里，全部都是迷你马
In my world, everyone's a pony,

408
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:30,870
他们都吃彩虹，然后便便是蝴蝶
and they all eat rainbows and poop butterflies.

409
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:34,941
那真是太赞了，凯蒂
That's beautiful, Katie.

410
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,175
虽然有点怪怪的
In a really weird way.

411
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,153
我的世界叫洁西卡王国 大家都超崇拜洁西卡女王
My world is called Jessica-land, and everyone worships Queen Jessica

412
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:45,985
因为洁西卡很漂亮
because Jessica is so beautiful.

413
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:48,890
洁西卡，那听起来棒呆了
Jessica, that was awesome.

414
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,126
-路迪! -小心点!
- Rudy! - Mom, be careful!

415
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,599
我好朋友席克住那上面
My best friend Thidwick lives on that.

416
00:27:56,668 --> 00:28:00,695
路迪，没人住在这上面 这是不可能的
Rudy, no one lives on this. It's not possible.

417
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,801
那个荷顿真可恶
That Horton is a menace.

418
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,069
妈!拜托，别这样
Mom, Mom! Please, you're so weird. Don't do this to me.

419
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,734
给我进房去
Honey, go to your room.

420
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,438
荷顿!
Horton!

421
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:12,945
射门得分!
It's good!

422
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:14,848
你到底在干嘛？
What do you think you're doing?

423
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,477
你们有大麻烦了!
You guys with worlds are in trouble!

424
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:20,752
-你忘了我们之前讨论过什么？ -记得，我是大象
- Have you forgotten what we discussed? - Oh, no. I'm an elephant,

425
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:23,191
大象从不忘记，这是个诅咒!
and elephants never forget. It's a curse, really.

426
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:24,990
我记得你哼了一声
I remember I was on my head, and you said "Humpf,"

427
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:27,031
我抬头看你，然后你说 “你到底在干麻？”
and I looked up, and you said, "What are you doing?"

428
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:28,190
我说了灰尘的事
And I said the thing about the speck.

429
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,359
你拉我耳朵，又戳我的额头…
Then you pulled my ears and you poked me in the forehead...

430
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:32,460
-荷顿! -没错，你动手了
- Horton! - Well, you did.

431
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:35,597
把那朵苜蓿花给我，马上给!
Give me that clover, Horton. Now!

432
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:38,633
不要
No.

433
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:43,340
不要？
No?

434
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:45,343
对
Yeah.

435
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:48,614
你确定你要跟我作对？
Are you sure you want to fight this fight, Horton?

436
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,384
我可以跟你保证 到时候场面一定很难看
Because I promise you it will get very ugly, very fast.

437
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,892
没多久你就会开始问自己
And you need to ask yourself,

438
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,396
我干嘛要把自己搞成这样？
"Do I really want to put myself through all this?

439
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:01,523
“就为了一朵苜蓿花？”
"For a clover?"

440
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,499
注意听我说，荷顿
Take it from me, Horton.

441
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,297
你没注意听
You don't.

442
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,338
快把它交出来!
So hand it over!

443
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:12,402
不要!我不能把它给你
No! I can't give it to you.

444
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,039
这粒灰尘上有住人
There are people on this speck.

445
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:16,876
虽然他们个子非常小
Granted, they're very small people,

446
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:19,815
但万物生而平等 不论他们有多渺小
but a person's a person, no matter how small.

447
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:29,252
你太离谱了，荷顿 我会让你付出代价的
You just crossed the line, Horton, and I'm gonna make you pay.

448
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,394
那个荷顿太危险了
That Horton is a menace.

449
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:39,937
他害这群孩子整天胡思乱想
He has those kids using their imaginations.

450
00:29:40,004 --> 00:29:41,062
太可恶了
It's sick.

451
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:45,940
好吧!我得快点把这粒灰尘 放到山顶去，要“快马加鞭”
All right, I gotta get this speck up to the top of Mount Nool, ASAP,

452
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:50,743
虽然我不是马 但人家说飞象也能过河
whatever that means. Probably, "Act Swiftly, Awesome Pachyderm."

453
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:53,079
那有什么困难的？
I mean, how hard can that be?

454
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,483
只不过是条…保证摔死大象的桥
It's just a straight plummet to certain death.

455
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:07,427
这看起来有点…不太坚固
This looks kind of precarious.

456
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,628
先不要吓自己
Well, no need to worry.

457
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:12,892
他们当初建这条桥的时候
Obviously, when they build a bridge like this,

458
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:16,839
一定有想过有一天会有大象走过
they take into account that elephants will be crossing here.

459
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:22,641
很好，还不错 我就稍微给它…试试看!
All right. Feels good. I'll just get the feel of it!

460
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,190
勇气
That's true.

461
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,825
没错

462
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:52,470
噢，天啊
Oh, God.

463
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:55,536
你好，今天好吗，镇长先生？
Hello. And how are we today, Mr. Mayor?

464
00:30:57,448 --> 00:30:59,211
说：“啊”
Say, "Ah."

465
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,190
请漱漱口
Rinse, please.

466
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:19,633
这里有些木板也早该换了吧
I think a few of these boards could stand to be replaced.

467
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,310
我要想像我很轻 我轻得像…羽毛
I just need to think light. I'm light as a feather.

468
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:36,250
轻飘飘的…羽毛!
I'm light as a feather!

469
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:44,861
好重的羽毛
Heavy feather.

470
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:49,197
这针只会有一点点痛
Okay, this will just pinch a little.

471
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:54,368
我得比羽毛还轻 有什么比羽毛还轻？
I'm lighter than a feather. What's lighter than a feather?

472
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,841
空气!没有比它轻的了 所以这就表示
Air! There's nothing lighter. So it stands to reason

473
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,773
只要我吸入愈多空气
that the more air I have,

474
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,846
我就能…变更轻
the lighter I'll be.

475
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,155
下一位，请进
Next, please.

476
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,226
真是吓死人了
All right, that was absolutely terrifying.

477
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:59,462
现在我得把自已拉上去
If I just pull myself up!

478
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:03,804
不要太紧张
Try not to panic.

479
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:26,195
刚刚差一点就锉起来
That could've been a disaster.

480
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:34,327
“脚踏实地”的感觉还真棒 让我有股想跳舞的冲动
Wow. I feel really good right now. Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.

481
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,490
没事了
All right.

482
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:05,035
乔乔!我需要你帮忙，有空吗？
Hey, JoJo! I need your help. Can you help me?

483
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:09,095
很好 首先，你先去姐妹们的房间
Okay, great. Okay. First, I need you to go to the girls' room.

484
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,566
把汉娜的陶瓷娃娃拿下来
Take down Hanna's china doll collection and then...

485
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:12,768
别盯着我的手看
Stop looking at my arm.

486
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,402
再把荷莉L集的灯泡收好
Put away Holly's light bulb collection, and then...

487
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:18,779
把容易坏或容易碎的东西全收好
You know what? Just take care of anything that might break or shatter.

488
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,781
好吧，我就让你一次看个够
Okay, take a good long look.

489
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,180
看够了吧？谢啦!儿子
Got it? Thanks, JoJo!

490
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:36,896
这些…还有那个…
Here. And... Take that. And...

491
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,233
老公，今天比较晚喔
Hi. You're home late.

492
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:51,848
抱歉老婆，我刚是去牙医那里 处理我的…手
Sorry, hon. I was just having some dental work done on my arm.

493
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,008
发生什么…
So, what was...

494
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:54,711
奈德!
Ned!

495
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,920
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

496
00:34:58,022 --> 00:34:59,421
你指的是？
What do you mean?

497
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,482
我不是侦探，不过你煸诘醯粕
Well, I'm no detective, Ned, but you are hanging from the chandelier.

498
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,993
我只是想把它移远一点
I just thought it might look better

499
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:07,258
免得我们晚上睡觉时被砸到
somewhere it can't fall on us and crush us in our sleep.

500
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,902
到底怎么回事？
What is going on?

501
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,601
老婆
Hey, hon,

502
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,944
你有没有过一种感觉 好像有人盯你看？
did you ever get the feeling that you were being watched?

503
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:27,874
对啊，我想是有吧
Yeah, sure. I suppose.

504
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:32,184
要是你知道一直盯着你看的那家伙
And then you get the feeling that maybe that thing watching you is

505
00:35:33,624 --> 00:35:35,785
是只…超大的大象呢？
a giant elephant?

506
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,229
要是有人跟你说你的世界
And you know how you get that weird feeling

507
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:42,289
居然是在一粒小灰尘上呢？
that your world is actually a tiny speck?

508
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,635
而我刚才提到的那只大象 它把灰尘放一朵花上
And that the elephant that I talked about earlier is carrying it around on a flower.

509
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:52,971
虽然你很清楚你要是说出来 大家一定会认为你疯了
And you realize that if you tell anybody, they'd think you were crazy.

510
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:57,741
但你还是觉得 你有责任保障大家的安全
But you still feel a responsibility to keep everyone safe.

511
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,307
你知道那种感觉吗？
You know that feeling?

512
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:04,083
我想我应该不知道
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.

513
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:06,282
你知道那种感觉吗？
Do you know that feeling?

514
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:11,120
才不咧
No.

515
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,667
真累，我想我该上床睡觉了
Yawn. Wow. I am beat. Time to hit the hay, I guess.

516
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:20,301
亲爱的，我知道你最近压力很大
Sweetheart, I know you're under a lot of stress,

517
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:25,266
所以就算你看到了大象和几朵花 那也不错啊
and if you're seeing elephants and flowers, then fine.

518
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:28,437
只是不要把这些事告诉别人
Just don't tell anyone else that story, okay?

519
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:31,504
别忘了，这并不是世界末日
And remember, it's not the end of the world.

520
00:36:33,851 --> 00:36:35,751
“世界末日”
"The end of the world."

521
00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:39,948
呼叫镇长，听到请回答，完毕
Horton to Mayor. Horton to Mayor. Come in, Mayor. Over.

522
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,920
荷顿？
Horton?

523
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,926
我这里收讯不太好
I get terrible reception here.

524
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:50,931
这样呢？我用力喊，你听得到吗？
How about this? If I get up real close, can you read me?

525
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:56,197
有!收到了
Yep! Roger that.

526
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:58,468
我们到安全的地方了吗？
Are we at that safe place yet?

527
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:02,201
就快到了 我想最困难的关卡已经过了
Almost. I'm pretty sure the worst part's over.

528
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:04,110
这是大象荷顿的报告
This is your elephant speaking.

529
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,708
我将带各位前往努尔山 请好好享受这趟旅程
Just sit back, enjoy the ride, and we'll have you to Mount Nool in no time.

530
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:09,786
不行，不能拿冰淇淋当早餐
No, you can't have ice cream for breakfast.

531
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:10,912
-拜托 -拜托
- Please. - Please.

532
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:12,216
那是谁？
Who's that?

533
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,780
那里还有别人吗？
Is there someone else there?

534
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,053
那是我太太…还有小孩
Well, that's my wife and kids.

535
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,684
你还有家人
You have a family.

536
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:24,059
没错，我有个漂亮老婆 九十六个女儿，还有一个儿子
I do, indeed. A beautiful wife, 96 daughters, and one son.

537
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:25,859
你还真行啊
Oh, busy guy.

538
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:28,828
我们还共用一间厕所，你懂吧
And we all share one bathroom. You know how that is.

539
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:31,366
当然，共用厕所嘛!
Yeah. Don't I know it.

540
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:33,935
厕所？
Bathroom?

541
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,273
-奈德! -什么？
- Ned! - What?

542
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:38,804
亲爱的，你知道你在屋顶上吧？
Sweetheart, you know you're on the roof, right?

543
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,316
-拜托，妈妈 -什么？
- Please, Mom. - What's that?

544
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,614
不行，快上床睡觉 爸爸今天精神不好
No, you need to go to bed. Daddy's having a breakdown.

545
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,848
奈德，你现在又怎样了？
Ned, what are you up to now?

546
00:37:44,922 --> 00:37:48,255
我正打算下去哄孩子睡觉
I was just about to put the kids to bed when I got off the roof.

547
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,192
事情就是这样，没错
And that's what happened. Right.

548
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:09,612
-爸爸？ -什么？
- Daddy? - Yes.

549
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,376
-你能不能帮我倒杯水？ -没问题
- Can I have a glass of water? - Of course.

550
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,418
-我也要 -我也要
- Me, too. - Me, three.

551
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:17,879
我也要
Me, 28.

552
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:19,183
好吧
Okay.

553
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:26,255
乔乔!
Hey, JoJo!

554
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:31,294
好多好多杯水啊 还遇见我想要遇见的人
A lot of liquid. A lot of liquid. Just the person I wanted to see.

555
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:36,271
最近我们父子意见总是相左
Yeah, I realize that we have not been seeing eye-to-eye lately,

556
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,308
大部份都是我不对
and most of it is my fault.

557
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:39,467
没错
It's true.

558
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:41,340
我一直都一意孤行
You know what I've been trying to do?

559
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:45,439
要你照我的想法去规划你的未来
I have been trying to impose my vision of your future on you.

560
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,449
让我好好跟你解释清楚
Let me make this perfectly clear.

561
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:53,080
乔乔，你想当什么样的镇长都行
JoJo, you can be whatever kind of Mayor you want to be.

562
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,887
积极、稳重、直率 哪一种都行
Hands-on, strong and silent, outspoken, it's up to you.

563
00:38:56,961 --> 00:39:00,089
很好，我感觉好多了
Well, good. I feel so much better.

564
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:04,190
我期待看到你有所成就，儿子
I am expecting big things from you, young man. Big things.

565
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:06,099
晚安
All right. Good night.

566
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:08,137
很好，就这样
Good stuff. Good talk.

567
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,087
接着乔乔溜出去，他孤单又难过
Then JoJo snuck out, feeling lonely and sad,

568
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,058
难过父亲竟然这么不了解自己
and tragically misunderstood by his dad.

569
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,278
他这么晚了要去哪里呢？
And where was he going at such a late hour?

570
00:39:50,748 --> 00:39:53,945
他跑到呼呼镇废弃弃的天文台上头
Up to Whoville's abandoned Star-Studying Tower,

571
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:58,617
这里让他感到自在又满足
a place where the boy felt contented, free.

572
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,658
这里让他能随心所欲
A place he could be what he wanted to be.

573
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:06,926
那里头有什么，先让我卖个关子
And what was inside there, I'd say if I could.

574
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:10,694
But up above, the Kangaroo was up to no good.

575
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,696
这时在外头 袋鼠妈妈正在进行邪恶的计划

576
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,801
我可以出来吗？
Can I come out now, Mom?

577
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,936
不行，路迪，待在你的房间里
No, Rudy. Stay in your room.

578
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:24,173
-但是… -在里头待好
- But, Mom... - Stay inside.

579
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,725
维拉考夫先生
Mr. Vladikoff?

580
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:52,035
吃饭，滚
Eating. Go.

581
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:56,341
我知道你在吃大餐 但是我需要你帮忙
Yes, I realize you're busy, but I need your help.

582
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,178
那个荷顿
It's Horton.

583
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:01,013
他最近被一朵苜蓿给迷昏了
He's become obsessed with a clover.

584
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:04,646
他还幻想那上面有住人
And he actually thinks there are little people on it.

585
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:09,184
我要你把苜蓿给做了
I want that clover destroyed.

586
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,423
小事，杀鸡需要用牛刀吗？ 你自己动手吧
Sure. What a big deal this is for you, bro.

587
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:18,858
我本来想自己动手 但身为贵妇，我才不想弄脏手
I'd do it myself, but being a lady, I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

588
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:22,404
不过我听说你从不嫌手脏
But I hear you have no problem with that.

589
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:25,264
对
No.

590
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:28,209
没问题，简单得很
No problem. Easy peazy.

591
00:41:28,712 --> 00:41:32,239
但那也得看你的诚意
But I will only do this for a price.

592
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:35,113
最起码要给我一对全新的…
In exchange for a brand new pair of...

593
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,276
不
No.

594
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:40,713
我要这只小袋鼠
This little kangaroo.

595
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,557
-妈! -安静，妈咪正在想事情
- Mom! - Quiet, Rudy. Mommy's thinking it over.

596
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,397
谢了，经过我仔细考虑
Well, thanks, but on second thought,

597
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:52,924
我还是找猴子军团
I think I'm going to have the Wickersham brothers

598
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:54,299
帮忙好了
take care of this for me.

599
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:57,272
很好，找他们，他们人多势众
Yeah, of course, Wickersham. I mean, they're a classy operation.

600
00:41:57,374 --> 00:42:00,366
不!你不能找他们!
You know, they do... Wait! No! You can't go with Wickersham!

601
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:04,642
不、不、不… 这件事让猴子们来处理最适合
No, no, no, the Wickershams would be perfect for this job.

602
00:42:04,748 --> 00:42:08,275
那群笨猴子，连吓都吓不死人
But they're monkeys! Is not scary!

603
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:12,151
还是谢谢你，下次再说吧
Thanks, anyway. Maybe next time.

604
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,814
等等!
Wait!

605
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:16,917
我会这样对付那朵苜蓿花
Here is what I will do to precious clover.

606
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:20,327
先逮住它，然后压扁它
I will take it, I will crush it,

607
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:23,229
最后再一口吞掉它
and I will devour it.

608
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:31,874
这比想像的大
Bigger than it look.

609
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:33,637
等一下!
One second.

610
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:37,075
我的妈呀!
Holy moly.

611
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:39,710
先等一等
Hang on.

612
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,250
之后我再把它吐出来
Then I regurgitate it.

613
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:48,087
然后我会再把它给吞下去!
Then I'm going to devour it second time!

614
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,316
所以总共是吞了两次
So, two times devoured.

615
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:55,192
听起来不错 但是我想先找猴子们谈谈
Sounds nice, but I think I'll talk to the Wickershams.

616
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:57,126
等等!
Wait!

617
00:42:57,835 --> 00:42:59,598
现在刚好在做促销
Here is best part.

618
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,970
我愿意…免费奉送
I do all gratis.

619
00:43:04,942 --> 00:43:06,842
这可是免费的
That's free, bro.

620
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:09,411
你觉得如何？
What do you think?

621
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,107
成交
Deal.

622
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:17,119
好耶!搞定，感谢你 这次是做口碑的
Yes! Score. Thanking you. You won't regret.

623
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,614
镇长!
Mayor!

624
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:55,989
镇长!
Mayor!

625
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,427
快开门，镇长先生!
Open up, Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

626
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:03,594
下雪了!现在是夏天!
It's snowing! In the summer!

627
00:44:08,706 --> 00:44:10,901
没错，真的下雪了
Yes. Yes, it is.

628
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:13,169
气候出现戏剧性的变化
It's a dramatic change in the weather,

629
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:15,837
我们就像一粒空中的小灰尘
as if we were a speck, floating through space.

630
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:19,610
我不知道你是怎么知道的 但全被你说中了
I don't know how you knew, but somehow you did,

631
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:24,745
现在呼呼镇即将面临一场大灾难
and Whoville is headed for disaster.

632
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,984
天哪，荷顿
Horton.

633
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:28,149
什么？
What?

634
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:30,125
没事，我来处理
Nothing. I'm on it.

635
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:33,254
该是我们拯救呼呼镇的时候了
It's up to us to save the people of Whoville.

636
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:40,102
你们虽然还小，但人很多耶!
You're small, but there are a lot of you!

637
00:44:40,904 --> 00:44:42,531
真是的
That's it.

638
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,066
好了，后面还有吗？
Okay, anybody else?

639
00:44:46,543 --> 00:44:48,101
很好
Good.

640
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:53,273
这不好玩，这是末日的征兆!
No, no. No enjoyment. This is not fun. It is a sign of doom!

641
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:56,844
亲爱的，真是…
Aw, sweetie, that's...

642
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,480
不!危险!危险!
No, no, no! Danger! Danger!

643
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:04,553
立刻停止一切玩乐的行为!
Stop having fun immediately!

644
00:45:04,628 --> 00:45:06,994
这样真的很危险!
This is dangerous! Okay!

645
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:11,260
停止!
Stop it!

646
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,136
荷顿!
Horton!

647
00:45:27,985 --> 00:45:29,543
镇长
Hey, Mayor.

648
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:31,618
代志大条了啦
We're in big trouble down here.

649
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,486
夏天才过一半居然下雪了
It's happening! It's snowing in the middle of summer.

650
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,593
世界末日到了!
It's the end of the world!

651
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:43,099
等等，我大概知道问题出在哪里
Hold on, Mayor. I think I know what your problem is.

652
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:55,979
现在好一点没？
There. That better?

653
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:00,175
效果还蛮不错的
That seems to have worked.

654
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:02,979
好像有花生的味道？
Do I smell peanuts?

655
00:46:03,053 --> 00:46:06,819
对，那是我最爱吃的点心 但味道会散不掉
Yeah, they're my favorite snack, but they tend to linger.

656
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:13,621
鱼宝宝，不!
Finwick, no!

657
00:46:15,332 --> 00:46:18,324
等一下，镇长先生 我想有人来找碴了
Hang on, Mr. Mayor. I may have to put up a fight.

658
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,700
一只受惊的大象是很恐怖的
A frightened elephant can be very dangerous!

659
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:24,638
这可是你自己找的喔，老兄!
All right! You've called down the thunder, buddy!

660
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:29,304
想找碴？我可是加足马力了! 有种来吧!
You hungry for trouble? I'm an "All you can eat" salad bar! Take a bite!

661
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:33,911
我讨厌跑步
I hate running.

662
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:35,349
摩登!
Morton!

663
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:37,717
不要吓我
Don't do that.

664
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:39,448
荷顿!
Horton!

665
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,654
荷顿!你在这里!
Horton! There you are!

666
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:45,251
有麻烦了!你有听说吗？
We got trouble! Wait, stay, wait! Did you hear that?

667
00:46:45,362 --> 00:46:50,561
不，听我说 袋鼠妈妈，已经发疯，脑袋坏了
No, I'm here, okay. Listen. No! Go! Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

668
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,500
她告诉大家要把你踢出努尔森林
She's telling everyone that you should be kicked out of Nool.

669
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,334
她那样说？我还以为我们是朋友
She said that? I thought we were her friends.

670
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:58,533
听说她去找了维拉!
Word is she's gone to Vlad!

671
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:01,942
我认识两个维拉
Vlad? Vlad? I know two Vlads.

672
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:06,038
是那个坏的维拉 还是会烤饼干的兔子维拉？
Is it the bad Vlad or the bunny Vlad that makes the cookies?

673
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:09,677
她最好是会派兔子送饼干给你
Yeah, Horton, she's sending you a bunny with cookies.

674
00:47:09,753 --> 00:47:12,688
用膝盖想也知道是坏的维拉
I think we can assume it's the bad Vlad.

675
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:14,220
对，那样才合理
Yeah, that's a good call.

676
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:19,388
所以除非你能忍受 那双心狠手辣凶残的臭爪子
So unless you're cool with giant, razor-sharp claws

677
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:23,194
把你的身体撕成碎片… 快把花给丢掉吧
ripping the flesh off your body, I'd get rid of the clover!

678
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:26,259
不可以!我答应过镇长
I can't! I promised the Mayor.

679
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,271
我说到做到…做不到就不说
I meant what I said, and I said what I meant,

680
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,933
我们大象的忠诚度是百分百
and an elephant's faithful, 100%.

681
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:37,241
拜托，为了我，就这么一次 忠诚度做到九十九分就好了
Please. For me, just this once. Be faithful 99% of the time.

682
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:41,751
我从来没拿过九十九分 但我还是很棒的!
I've never gotten 99% on anything, and I think I'm awesome! So, come on!

683
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:45,584
我遵守承诺，一言既出驷马难…
I meant what I said, and I said what I meant.

684
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,283
那我就不追了
I'm not gonna say it.

685
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:51,384
不过你瞎忙一整天也没用
You can do that all day, it's not happening.

686
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:53,393
大象的忠诚…
An elephant's faithful, 100%.

687
00:47:53,463 --> 00:47:58,127
没错，那是我的原则、座右铭 谢谢你提醒我
That's right. That's my code, my motto. But thanks for the warning.

688
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:00,503
座右铭，好吧
Motto. Okay.

689
00:48:00,604 --> 00:48:02,504
但是要留意天上
But watch the skies.

690
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:05,770
一定要紧盯着天空!
Keep watching the skies!

691
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:12,577
镇长，快通知所有人躲好
Mayor, you need to get everyone underground.

692
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:14,207
快!
Now!

693
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:16,348
我并不想发出警报
I don't want to sound the alarm,

694
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,445
但我们极有可能会遭到一只
but there's a good possibility we may be attacked

695
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:21,491
-大型肉食性鸟类攻击 -什么？
- by a giant carnivorous bird. - What?

696
00:48:21,592 --> 00:48:24,925
也有可能是会遇上送饼干的兔子 但我想机会不大
There's a small chance it could be a bunny with cookies, but I wouldn't count on it.

697
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:28,564
那真是太可怕了
They are formidable.

698
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:30,623
镇长，你在吗？
Mayor? Are you there?

699
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:34,093
在，那真是个好主意，只是…
Yeah. No. That's a great idea. It's just...

700
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:38,369
如果要让大家动起来 我必须取得镇议会批准
In order to get everyone mobilized, I'd need the okay of the City Council,

701
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:41,035
但他们从不肯听我说
and they never listen to me.

702
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:43,169
他们还叫我笨蛋!
I've been called a boob,

703
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,111
叫了好几次，我办不到!
several times. I can't do it!

704
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:48,111
你必须警告他们，镇长!
You have to talk to them, Mayor! Okay. Listen.

705
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:52,078
坏的维拉!
Bad Vlad!

706
00:48:52,155 --> 00:48:53,918
坏的维拉!
Bad Vlad!

707
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,820
坏的维拉!
Bad Vlad!

708
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:05,224
那绝对不是送饼干的兔子
That is definitely not a bunny.

709
00:49:13,043 --> 00:49:17,309
甩掉他了 我想甩掉他，就甩掉他了
Lost him. Meant to lose him, and I lost him. Good.

710
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:24,348
这树真碍事!
Is this tree for real? Come on!

711
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:27,413
抓紧了呼呼镇!这下麻烦大了!
Hang on, Whoville! This is gonna get rough!

712
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:40,699
准备好受死吧!
Now you're going to get it!

713
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:43,763
让你见识一下高手!
Get ready for the best!

714
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,410
离我远一点!
Leave me alone!

715
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:54,810
荷顿!
Horton!

716
00:50:06,263 --> 00:50:08,026
他一定会从某个地方跳出来
I just know he's gonna jump out somewhere.

717
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:09,656
哈
Hello.

718
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:31,413
投降吧
Chess mate.

719
00:50:31,955 --> 00:50:34,321
现在让我把苜蓿花拿过来
Now it's time for me to take clover

720
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:37,154
毁了上面所有的小小人…
and crush all the little people on it, who are saying...

721
00:50:37,294 --> 00:50:40,661
抱歉，我们先从这里下去了
Sorry. This is where we get off.

722
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,067
鼻子歪了啦!
Right in the beak!

723
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:50,934
漂亮!我的头脑还真灵光
Cool line. Usually I can't think of those things till later.

724
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:53,575
-镇长 -荷顿
- Mayor? - Horton.

725
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:54,902
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

726
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:04,253
还好，怎么回事？那鸟呢？
Well, more or less. What happened? The bird?

727
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:08,522
他啊，他居然攻击我 镇长，你的镇民现在有危险
Yeah, it attacked me. Mayor, your people are in danger.

728
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:12,019
我打算这么做
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

729
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:15,360
我要告诉大家发生了什么事
I'm going to go out there and tell them what is going on.

730
00:51:15,465 --> 00:51:17,626
太好了! 快，事不宜迟
Perfect. Now, quick. Get going.

731
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,801
镇长先生!不太对劲啊!
Hey! Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!

732
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:29,141
-我的地下室变成阁楼了 -科学博物馆全毁了
- My basement's in the attic. - The Science Museum is history.

733
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:33,046
-失物招领处不见了 -到底怎么了，镇长先生？
- The lost and found is missing. - What's going on, Mr. Mayor?

734
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,482
我要宣布进入紧急状态
I'm declaring a state of emergency!

735
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:38,544
没事的!别担心!
Don't worry! Don't worry!

736
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:41,215
镇长他只是在耍白痴
The Mayor is just being a moron.

737
00:51:41,324 --> 00:51:44,691
等等，呼呼镇现在非常危险
No, wait! Whoville is in terrible danger!

738
00:51:44,795 --> 00:51:48,697
所有人都该立刻躲进地下室避难
Everyone needs to get down to the underground storage area immediately.

739
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:50,699
好吧!好吧!
Fine! Fine!

740
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:53,395
我们就用民主的方式解决
Let's do this democratically.

741
00:51:54,304 --> 00:51:57,796
有谁希望看到呼呼镇 伟大光荣的百年庆
Who wants the joy and glory and festivity

742
00:51:57,874 --> 00:52:01,571
照计划进行？
of the Who-Centennial to proceed as planned?

743
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:03,809
好耶!
Yeah!

744
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:07,477
又有谁和镇长一样
And who, like the Mayor,

745
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,248
认为最好能在黑漆漆的地下室里
thinks it would be better to spend the Who-Centennial

746
00:52:11,354 --> 00:52:14,721
度过呼呼镇百年庆呢？
in an underground storage area?

747
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:17,019
好耶!
Yeah!

748
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:20,429
等等，大家听我说
Wait! You've gotta listen to me!

749
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,522
我们的世界可能会爆炸毁灭
Our whole world could explode!

750
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:29,997
比这快多了
Much more quickly!

751
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:33,371
也不会发出这种怪声
And our world wouldn't make that noise.

752
00:52:34,778 --> 00:52:37,713
人民已经作了决定，镇长先生
The people have spoken, Mr. Mayor.

753
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:42,111
你已经完蛋了，没有人相信你
You're finished. No one believes you.

754
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:44,346
也没人支持你
No one supports you.

755
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:48,215
荷顿就相信我
Horton believes me.

756
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,918
荷顿？
Horton?

757
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:52,692
谁是荷顿？
Who's Horton?

758
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:58,526
荷顿是…在天上的一只大象
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky!

759
00:52:59,402 --> 00:53:00,801
不用找了，他是隐形的
Don't bother looking, he's invisible.

760
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:04,568
他正冒着生命危险拯救我们
And he's the one risking his life to get Whoville,

761
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:09,374
让落在花朵上小灰尘里的呼呼镇 得到安全
which, by the way, is a speck on a clover, to safety!

762
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:22,391
我可以证明
I can prove it!

763
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:25,451
荷顿的声音会从这喇叭传出来
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.

764
00:53:30,066 --> 00:53:31,090
荷顿!
Horton!

765
00:53:32,302 --> 00:53:35,567
我已召集所有人民到广场集合
I have all the Whos gathered in town square!

766
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:37,573
让他们听听你的声音
Let them know you're there!

767
00:53:38,575 --> 00:53:42,136
天，原来当公众人物压力这么大
Gee. This is kind of a high-pressure situation, then.

768
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:47,944
我还真不知道该说什么
Wow. I am really drawing a blank here.

769
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,713
我知道了
I know!

770
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,048
荷顿
Horton!

771
00:53:55,425 --> 00:53:57,359
荷顿，快点啊!
Horton, we're waiting!

772
00:53:58,094 --> 00:54:00,392
是时候该向大家证明你的存在
Time to show everyone that you exist,

773
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:04,763
顺便说明白…我绝对不是笨蛋
and by extension, what a non-boob I am.

774
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:12,970
等等!
Wait!

775
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:17,980
大家看那个风 你们以为那代表了什么？
Everyone, look at the wind. What do you think that that means?

776
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:20,416
那是代表…
It means...

777
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:23,213
那很明显地是代表…
It means, obviously...

778
00:54:24,054 --> 00:54:27,217
放风筝大赛现在开始
Let the kite-flying race begin!

779
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:47,376
看看你有多丢脸，荷顿
What a burn on you, Horton!

780
00:55:44,868 --> 00:55:46,768
啊…有够冰的
Brain freeze.

781
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:57,312
把花还给我
Give me back my speck!

782
00:55:57,414 --> 00:55:59,382
就差一点，可惜
Not this time, guy.

783
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:11,418
我真的很抱歉让你失望 但是这比我自己重要多了
I am so sorry that I let you down, but this... This is bigger than me.

784
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:14,657
带孩子们找个安全的地方躲好
Get the family together and get somewhere safe.

785
00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:18,096
我会的!我相信你
I will! I believe you.

786
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:26,439
这下看你怎么玩，大笨象
I've got you now, elephant.

787
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:30,379
不要丢…不要!
No, no, no!

788
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:43,315
不
Oh, no!

789
00:57:10,854 --> 00:57:12,481
镇长？
Mayor?

790
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,622
有人在家吗？
Anybody there?

791
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,085
哈？
Hello?

792
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:19,422
有人吗？
Anyone?

793
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:22,889
荷顿他找过了一朵又一朵
But clover by clover by clover, he found

794
00:57:22,999 --> 00:57:26,400
却怎么也找不到他要找的那一朵
that the one he sought for was just not around.

795
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,097
镇长？
Mayor?

796
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,798
哈？
Hello?

797
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:35,470
直到中午，可怜的荷顿精疲力尽
And by noon, poor Horton, more dead than alive,

798
00:57:35,545 --> 00:57:39,845
他找过的九千零五朵花 已堆成许多花堆
had picked, searched and piled up 9,005.

799
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:42,477
哈？
Hello?

800
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:44,987
抱歉打扰到你了
Sorry to bother you,

801
00:57:45,054 --> 00:57:46,612
没人
nobody.

802
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,520
敲敲门
Knock, knock.

803
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:56,321
这时候你该说 系“象”啦？
This is where you'd say, "Who's there?"

804
00:57:56,399 --> 00:57:59,596
如果你在的话
If there were any Whos there.

805
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:03,705
听懂没？系“象”啦!
Get it? "Whos there."

806
00:58:07,944 --> 00:58:11,277
他整天不停的找
All day he looked, looked on and on,

807
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:15,074
直到他已几乎放弃希望
until his hope was almost gone.

808
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:18,544
不…拜托，不要!
No, no, no! Please, no!

809
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:21,757
这样不公平啦!
This isn't fair!

810
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:28,591
等一下，难道会是这一朵吗？
But, wait, could this one be the one?

811
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:31,428
他千辛万苦要找的就是这朵？
Was all his searching finally done?

812
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:34,264
是的，皇天不负苦心人
Ah, yes, for this was the hour.

813
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,601
荷顿终于找到了 就在这三百多万朵花之中
Horton had found them on the three millionth flower.

814
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:40,107
镇长!镇长!

815
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,075
我找到你了!
I found you!

你在吗？
Are you there?

818
00:58:48,284 --> 00:58:49,911
镇长？
Mayor?

819
00:58:53,556 --> 00:58:55,114
镇长
Mayor.

820
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,731
镇长？
Mayor, are you there?

821
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:08,396
镇长？
Mayor!

822
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,168
镇长？
Mayor?

823
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:19,608
镇长？
Mayor?

824
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:24,453
镇长!
Mayor!

825
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:34,623
不，我是佛洛德
No, this is Floyd.

826
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:37,865
你要留话吗？
Can I take a message?

827
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:44,798
镇长!你没事了!
Mayor! You're okay!

828
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:50,279
荷顿!别乱动!停下来!
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!

829
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,043
抱歉
Sorry.

830
00:59:55,118 --> 00:59:58,849
你们下面刚刚一定很惨 真高兴你们没事
It must have been rough down there. I can't believe I found you.

831
00:59:58,955 --> 01:00:01,048
我都快担心死了
You really had me worried.

832
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:04,390
老天!镇长先生是对的!
Say! The Mayor was right!

833
01:00:04,494 --> 01:00:06,792
爸爸!爸爸!爸爸!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

834
01:00:06,863 --> 01:00:09,957
好了，我没事了 宝贝女儿你们也是
Okay, I'm all right, and so are you.

835
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:17,530
呼呼镇的镇民们!
Citizens of Whoville!

836
01:00:19,676 --> 01:00:23,874
见过我们的朋友荷顿
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.

837
01:00:28,051 --> 01:00:29,985
他会帮助我们
He's going to help us!

838
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:33,682
交给我吧
I've got this.

839
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:36,020
我是议会主席…
This is the Chairman...

840
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:37,184
白痴!
Idiot!

841
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,229
你完蛋了!听见没？废弃物!
You're finished in this town! Is that understood? Finished.

842
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,025
大笨蛋!
You boob!

843
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:45,367
跟你开玩笑的啦
I'm just joking.

844
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,031
很好笑
Good one.

845
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:53,200
荷顿，这位是我太太，莎莉
Horton, this is my wife Sally.

846
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:54,607
你真的存在!
You exist!

847
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:57,077
这就表示我的老公没发疯
This means my husband isn't crazy.

848
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,772
好耶!
Hooray!

849
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:03,080
还有我几个女儿… 海莉、荷莉、胡莉、海达和海蒂
And a few of my daughters, Haley, Holly, Hooly, Hilda and Hedy.

850
01:01:03,186 --> 01:01:04,346
-你好 -你好
- Hi! - Hi!

851
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,947
还有叶波小姐，我最得力的助手
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.

852
01:01:08,057 --> 01:01:10,685
-接着是拉鲁博士 -你救了我们!
- And here's Dr. Larue. - You saved us!

853
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,227
会计部的伯特
And Burt from accounting,

854
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:15,025
梅洁莉寇迪太太和法福根先生
and Mrs. McGillicuddy, and Mr. Farfoogan

855
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:17,032
他来自克鲁格法福根
from the Clugan Farfoogans,

856
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,863
还有在浴缸泡澡的老头
and the old man in the bathtub.

857
01:01:18,935 --> 01:01:20,698
别折磨他了
Let's not overwhelm the poor fellow.

858
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,533
他不可能记得所有名字的
He's never gonna remember all these names.

859
01:01:22,605 --> 01:01:25,540
我尽量试试看
Well, I'll try my best.

860
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:28,774
莎莉、主席
Sally, Chairman,

861
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:31,073
海莉、胡莉、荷莉…叶波小姐

01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:34,082
拉鲁博士、会计部的伯特 梅洁莉寇迪太太、法福根先生
Dr. Larue, Burt from accounting, Mrs. McGillicuddy, Mr. Farfoogan

863
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,314
是不是有个老头在洗澡？
of the Clugan Farfoogans, and wasn't there an old guy in a shower?

864
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:39,718
泡澡
Bathtub.

865
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:41,882
-噢，差一点! -我们全都在这里，荷顿
- Yeah! - We're all here, Horton,

866
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:46,254
还有…我们全都相信你
and we all believe in you.

867
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:49,088
那真是太棒了
Wow. That's awesome.

868
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:51,998
我对于你们的承诺绝对不打折
And it's a responsibility I do not take lightly.

869
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:56,265
我保证你们会有一个 安稳又健全的未来
I promise you a future that is safe, sound and stable.

870
01:01:56,339 --> 01:02:01,641
我们要开创一个世界 让大家都有国民年金跟老农津贴
We will create a world where every Who is endowed with three inalienable rights,

871
01:02:01,744 --> 01:02:03,268
这是我们接下来必须做的
to be determined at a later date.

872
01:02:04,781 --> 01:02:09,650
我们要把这粒小小的灰尘 在十年之内放到努尔山上去
And we will put a speck on Mount Nool before the end of this decade.

873
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,661
这只大象疯了!我的老天爷
This elephant is crazy! Oh, my goodness.

874
01:02:19,762 --> 01:02:23,459
我得告诉大家，我要找袋鼠妈妈
I gotta tell everybody. I need to get to the Kangaroo.

875
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,434
等到他们发现就…
Wait till they find out about...

876
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:30,261
你该看看当时我有多猛 我狠狠教训了那只大象
You should have been seeing me. I really let elephant have it.

877
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:35,106
我追击他、折磨他 把那只大象撕烂成几百万个碎片
I chase him, I torment him, I break him into million little elephant pieces.

878
01:02:35,678 --> 01:02:39,546
我这次干得漂亮，真的 最俐落的一次，维拉代表作
It was thing of beauty, really. My best work. Classic Vlad.

879
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:40,775
那朵苜蓿花呢？
And the clover?

880
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:44,684
它早毁了!荷顿别想找到它!
Clover is finished! No way in million years Horton find it.

881
01:02:44,787 --> 01:02:48,518
读我的鸟嘴，苜蓿花已经氐淄甑傲
Read my beak. Clover is gone forever.

882
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,796
我刚看到荷顿还在跟那朵花说话
I just saw Horton, and he is still talking to that clover!

883
01:03:01,804 --> 01:03:02,930
大饭桶!
Idiot!

884
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:07,704
我是你兄弟，你谈心的好对象 我们都是老朋友了
Whoa! Come on, I'm your bro! It's me you're talking to. We have history!

885
01:03:08,478 --> 01:03:11,538
别忘了这一切还是免费服务
Come on, let's not forget, I did this for free!

886
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:15,678
努尔森林到底出了什么问题？
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?

887
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:19,416
这里以往都是居民归居民
There once was a time when people were people

888
01:03:19,522 --> 01:03:21,513
小灰尘归小灰尘
and specks were specks.

889
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:26,352
那看不到、听不到或感觉不到的
Well, I say, "If you can't see it, hear it or feel it,

890
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:28,397
根本就不存在!
"it doesn't exist!"

891
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:32,033
我们的生活模式正受到破坏
Our way of life is under attack!

892
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:35,593
这是谁造成的？荷顿!
And who is leading that attack? Horton!

893
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:38,333
哗!哗!哗!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

894
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:40,807
先等一等!现在说的是荷顿吗？
Wait a minute! This is Horton we're talking about.

895
01:03:40,877 --> 01:03:43,846
我们都认识他，他连屁都不乱放
You all know him, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

896
01:03:43,913 --> 01:03:48,179
除了那次把学生熏昏之外 但他绝对不是故意的
Except for that fly city he sat on. But he didn't do that on purpose.

897
01:03:48,251 --> 01:03:50,219
闭嘴，臭老鼠!
Shut up, mouse!

898
01:03:50,753 --> 01:03:54,587
当我没说，我的蛋糕快烤焦了 我该闪 了
That's weird. My brownies are burning. I gotta go!

899
01:03:55,758 --> 01:04:01,219
我们真的要让荷顿这个惹祸精 毒害孩子们的心灵吗？
Are we going to let troublemakers like Horton poison the minds of our children?

900
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:03,265
孩子是无辜的!
Not the children!

901
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:08,432
当荷顿告诉孩子们 关于丛林以外的世界
When Horton tells our children about worlds beyond the jungle,

902
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:10,768
就是在质疑家长的权威
he makes them question authority!

903
01:04:10,873 --> 01:04:14,900
导致孩子们的叛逆 导致社会陷入混乱
Which leads to defiance! Which leads to anarchy!

904
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:17,468
没错，荷顿要付出代价!
Yeah! Horton must pay!

905
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,047
都是小灰尘惹的祸
It's that speck!

906
01:04:19,115 --> 01:04:21,015
我们必须采取行动
We have to do something!

907
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,414
为了孩子们!
For the children!

908
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:23,884
为了孩子们!
For the children!

909
01:04:23,953 --> 01:04:28,890
我们要让他就此逍遥法外吗？
Are we going to let him get away with this?

910
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,983
不
No!

911
01:04:31,227 --> 01:04:32,956
我们去抓他
Let's go!

912
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:00,011
摩登!我说过，大象最讲信用!
Morton! I told you! 100%!

913
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,850
荷顿!
Horton!

914
01:05:01,924 --> 01:05:04,324
摩登，脚步声轻一点，真是的
Morton, pick up your feet! Jeez.

915
01:05:04,427 --> 01:05:06,327
我没那么重!
It's not me!

916
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,696
我知道了，是一群暴民 抱歉，摩登
I see. It's an angry mob. Sorry, Morton.

917
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:14,201
我还以为是你…
I thought it was you that was making all the...

918
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:15,964
不过这个…
But it's...

919
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:17,596
天啊
Oh, darn.

920
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:20,704
荷顿，快跑
Run, Horton!

921
01:05:21,344 --> 01:05:23,107
他在那里!
There he is!

922
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,445
把他绑起来!
Let's rope him!

923
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:27,414
把他关起来!
Let's cage him!

924
01:05:28,517 --> 01:05:31,543
不!不!不!
No! No! No!

925
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,684
停!
Stop!

926
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:40,288
各位，大家好
Hey, fellas. Good to see you,

927
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:41,990
全都到齐了
all at once.

928
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,554
你们还真声势浩大啊
You look really great as a horde.

929
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:45,624
荷顿、荷顿、荷顿
Horton, Horton, Horton,

930
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:49,398
看你为自己制造了多大的麻烦
look at the mess you've created for yourself.

931
01:05:49,505 --> 01:05:53,236
全都是为了那朵小蠢花
All this hullabaloo over a silly little flower.

932
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:55,572
是一粒灰尘
It's a speck.

933
01:05:55,811 --> 01:06:00,578
随便，这真是笨透了 这蠢东西害你被五花大绑
Right. I mean, it's silly, really, all this talk of roping you,

934
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:05,052
还要被关起来…不用说那么清楚
and caging you, and, well, we don't need to go into the details.

935
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:10,251
重点是，这群愤怒的群众 还有你制造的一切麻烦
The point is, this angry mob, all the trouble you're in,

936
01:06:10,359 --> 01:06:12,384
全都能一笔勾消
it can all go away.

937
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,563
-真的？ -当然
- Really? - Of course.

938
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:23,165
你只需要向大家认错 承认那粒小小的灰尘上
All you have to do is admit to everyone that there are no little people

939
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:25,070
并没有住人
living on that speck.

940
01:06:25,174 --> 01:06:28,610
承认你是错的，而我是对的
That you were wrong and I was right.

941
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:34,944
照我说的去做，一切就能回归正轨
You do that and things can go right back to the way they were.

942
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:41,887
但如果你不肯，你就准备付出代价吧
But if you don't, you're going to have to pay the price.

943
01:06:49,565 --> 01:06:52,227
只要说一切都是假的就行了？
So, I just have to say it isn't true?

944
01:06:57,406 --> 01:07:01,536
动手吧，绑我、关我 你们想怎样都行
Go ahead. Rope me, cage me. Do whatever you want.

945
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:04,002
但是灰尘上真的有住人
But there are people on this speck.

946
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:08,574
他们还有镇长，他有96个女儿 和一个叫乔乔的儿子
And they have a Mayor, who has 96 daughters and one son named JoJo,

947
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:11,711
他们共用一间厕所…管它是什么
who all share a bathroom, whatever that is,

948
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:16,582
虽然你们听不到也看不到他们
and even though you can't hear or see them at all,

949
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:19,992
万物生而平等，不论他们有多渺小
a person's a person, no matter how small.

950
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,835
说得可真动听，荷顿
That was beautiful, Horton.

951
01:07:30,306 --> 01:07:32,206
绑住他!关起来!
Rope him! Cage him!

952
01:07:32,274 --> 01:07:36,506
把那粒蠢灰尘丢到滚烫的热油里去
And burn that speck in a pot of boiling Beezlenut oil!

953
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,941
他们不相信我们在这里
They don't believe we're here.

954
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:45,179
我们必须制造点声音!
We've got to make some noise!

955
01:07:45,287 --> 01:07:47,551
我们在这、我们在这、我们在这
We are here! We are here! We are here!

956
01:07:47,623 --> 01:07:49,750
我们在这、我们在这
We are here! We are here! We are here!

957
01:07:49,825 --> 01:07:51,452
我们在这
We are here! We are here! We are here!

958
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:53,222
大声叫!
Come on!

959
01:07:53,496 --> 01:07:56,056
-大家一起叫! -我们在这!我们在这!我们在这!
- Everybody! - We are here! We are here! We are here!

960
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:58,327
我们在这!我们在这!我们在这!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

961
01:08:06,842 --> 01:08:10,835
这次教训是要告诉你 不要编那种灰尘上有人的故事
This will teach you not to make up stories about people on specks!

962
01:08:10,946 --> 01:08:13,312
你们听!他们在这里!
Listen! There they are!

963
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,187
-绑住他 -关起来
- Rope him. - Cage him!

964
01:08:19,622 --> 01:08:21,522
声音还不够大
It's not working.

965
01:08:21,624 --> 01:08:24,058
我听得到，但他们听力不够好
I can hear you, but their ears aren't strong enough.

966
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,821
我们必须大声一点
We need to be louder!

967
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:29,023
大家都来制造噪音，一起来!
Get every Who to make noise! Everyone!

968
01:08:29,131 --> 01:08:32,726
我们在这!我们在这!我们在这!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

969
01:08:32,835 --> 01:08:34,962
乔乔!你要去哪里？
JoJo! Where are you going?

970
01:08:35,137 --> 01:08:38,231
我们需要所有人的声音!乔乔!
We need every voice! JoJo!

971
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:46,078
声音必须再大一点 不然我们都完了!
You need to make some noise down there, or we'll all be destroyed!

972
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:50,352
镇长抓起了一对鼓槌 开始用力的打起来
The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom and started to smack it,

973
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:54,886
呼呼镇上上下下 全都卯足全力呼喊
and all over Whoville, they whooped up a racket.

974
01:08:57,059 --> 01:08:59,721
他们拿出锡锅、敲打黄铜平底锅
They rattled tin kettles! They beat on brass pans!

975
01:08:59,829 --> 01:09:02,320
脚踩垃圾桶和破铁罐
On garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans!

976
01:09:02,398 --> 01:09:05,367
他们吹奏低音喇叭和大喇叭
They blew on bazookas and blasted great toots.

977
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:08,870
还有竖笛、巴松和长笛
On clarinets, oompahs, and boompahs, and flutes!

978
01:09:11,674 --> 01:09:13,301
荷顿!
There!

979
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,343
他们现在听得到吗？
Can they hear us now?

980
01:09:16,879 --> 01:09:21,009
快听啊，求求你们 这是我听过最美妙的声音
Listen, please. It's the most beautiful thing ever.

981
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:23,051
我什么也没听到
I don't hear nothing!

982
01:09:23,419 --> 01:09:26,013
我想是没听到，继续试下去
I don't think so. But keep trying.

983
01:09:27,223 --> 01:09:29,123
我绝对不放弃
I'll never give in!

984
01:09:33,195 --> 01:09:37,291
你确定每个呼呼镇民 都有尽力制造声音吗？
Are you sure that every Who down in Whoville is trying?

985
01:09:44,406 --> 01:09:45,805
我们在这!我们在这…
We are here! We are here!

986
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,399
乔乔人呢？
Where's JoJo?

987
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:49,876
大概又跑到旧天文台去了
Probably at the old observatory.

988
01:10:03,425 --> 01:10:05,325
不要太过份了
Hey! There's a limit!

989
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:15,435
我的鼻子弹性没那么好
That's not supposed to stretch that far!

990
01:10:24,947 --> 01:10:26,574
乔乔!
JoJo!

991
01:10:26,782 --> 01:10:28,750
这些是你做的？
You built this?

992
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:22,293
我们在这!我们在这!我们在这!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

993
01:11:22,371 --> 01:11:25,499
我们在这!我们在这!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

994
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:30,637
我们在这!我们在这!我们在这!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

995
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:39,554
你大错特错了
You're making a mistake.

996
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:42,949
但是，妈!
But, Mom!

997
01:11:43,025 --> 01:11:45,858
这不干你的事，回你房间去!
This doesn't concern you, sweetie. Back in your pouch!

998
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,468
大家注意!别停!
Everybody! Don't stop!

999
01:11:56,171 --> 01:11:58,571
大家继续，这次一定有用!
Keep going! This is gonna do it!

1000
01:11:58,674 --> 01:12:03,008
我们在这!我们在这!我们在这!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1001
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:04,272
他们听到没？
Can they hear?

1002
01:12:04,346 --> 01:12:05,904
没!
No!

1003
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:17,718
不管最后结果如何 你都是我最棒的儿子
No matter what happens, I couldn't ask for a better son.

1004
01:12:21,397 --> 01:12:23,058
乔乔!
Hey, JoJo!

1005
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,860
继续，不要放弃!
Come on! Keep going!

1006
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:32,400
不!
No!

1007
01:12:37,379 --> 01:12:40,974
我在这里!我在这里!我在这里!…
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1008
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:46,211
不!
No!

1009
01:12:52,227 --> 01:12:54,627
唷!
Yopp!

1010
01:13:00,469 --> 01:13:05,907
我们在这!我们在这!我们在这!
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1011
01:13:07,109 --> 01:13:09,270
我听到了!我听到了!
I hear it! I hear it!

1012
01:13:09,445 --> 01:13:10,673
他们在那里!
They are there!

1013
01:13:10,746 --> 01:13:15,479
而那一声呼喊 那一声小小的呼喊冲破天际
And that Yopp, that one small extra Yopp put it over,

1014
01:13:15,584 --> 01:13:18,417
所有呼呼族的声音从花上传出来
and all the Who noises burst out of the clover.

1015
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:20,512
-我听到了 -我也是
- I hear it! - Me, too!

1016
01:13:22,324 --> 01:13:24,815
儿子，把花给我!拿来…
Rudy. Give me that! Come...

1017
01:13:27,329 --> 01:13:30,662
儿子，快回到袋子里，听话
Rudy. Get back in the pouch. Now!

1018
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:35,063
不要，妈
No, Mom.

1019
01:13:36,805 --> 01:13:39,035
猴子们，把那朵花拿来
Wickershams! Get that clover!

1020
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:44,806
谁都可以!把花拿过来!
Anybody! Take it from him!

1021
01:13:56,358 --> 01:13:58,986
你成功了，镇长，你成功了
You did it, Mayor. You did it.

1022
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:02,295
我们成功了!
We did it!

1023
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,391
耶!
Yeah!

1024
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,040
干得好，儿子
Well done, son.

1025
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,942
干的好，镇长
All right, Mayor!

1026
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:18,839
老爸，你进入名人堂了
Dad, you're one of the greats!

1027
01:14:22,985 --> 01:14:25,647
大家别激动，慢慢来
Whoa. Easy, everyone! Easy!

1028
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:28,985
你好，维拉
Hi, Vlad.

1029
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,755
其实我在减肥，管他的
Well, I shouldn't, but...

1030
01:15:03,392 --> 01:15:05,622
这一刻可真感人
Oh, man, that is nice touch.

1031
01:15:06,395 --> 01:15:10,957
我想我太感动了，对吗？ 我太情绪化，眼泪要决堤了
I am a mess with this, right? Emotional! Here come the waterslide.

1032
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:14,864
我要感谢很多人
There's so many people to thank.

1033
01:15:14,937 --> 01:15:16,700
谢谢努尔的好居民
The good people of Nool,

1034
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:18,899
把我关进牢里还用棍子戳我
who put me in a cage and poked me with sticks.

1035
01:15:18,974 --> 01:15:20,168
戳他的就是我!
That was me!

1036
01:15:20,242 --> 01:15:23,405
我的兄弟摩登，一直支持着我
My buddy Morton, for being the only one who stood by me.

1037
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:24,672
也不算支持啦
Well, not right by me.

1038
01:15:24,746 --> 01:15:28,409
他躲在草丛里帮我出主意，他很小
He hid in the bushes, sending me good thoughts. He's small.

1039
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:30,713
老兄，你还真是文武全才
Dude, you are a warrior poet.

1040
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,919
最重要的是，我要感谢呼呼镇长
And most of all, I'd like to thank the Mayor of Whoville,

1041
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,514
他从一开始就相信我
who believed in me from the beginning.

1042
01:15:36,592 --> 01:15:40,153
荷顿，我们会很想念你的
Horton, we're going to miss you.

1043
01:15:42,464 --> 01:15:44,159
荷顿，少了你我们该怎么办？
What are we gonna do without you, Horton?

1044
01:15:44,566 --> 01:15:47,467
别担心，我会永远守护你们
Don't worry. I'll always be around.

1045
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,596
即使我在外流浪
And even as I wander

1046
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:54,141
我仍设法看顾你
I'm keeping you in sight

1047
01:15:54,243 --> 01:15:56,677
你是窗畔的烛火
You're a candle in the window

1048
01:15:56,778 --> 01:15:58,837
照亮冰冷黑暗的冬夜
On a cold, dark winter's night

1049
01:15:58,914 --> 01:16:00,245
真美的比喻
Beautiful metaphor.

1050
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:02,613
而我比我想像中
And I'm getting closer

1051
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:07,451
更靠近你
Than I ever thought I might

1052
01:16:07,956 --> 01:16:10,186
这音调高了一点
That's a little high for me.

1053
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:15,423
我再也无法克制这份情感
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1054
01:16:15,964 --> 01:16:21,197
我已忘记我是在抗拒什么
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1055
01:16:21,803 --> 01:16:24,636
就算我得匍匐在你脚下
And if I have to crawl upon your floor

1056
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:26,037
匍匐在你脚下
Crawl upon the floor

1057
01:16:26,108 --> 01:16:27,541
撞穿你家大门
Come crashing through your door

1058
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:28,871
撞穿你家大门
Crashing through your door

1059
01:16:28,944 --> 01:16:32,277
我再也无法克制…
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1060
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:39,048
我再也无法克制这份情感
I can't fight this feeling anymore

1061
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:47,520
从此荷顿和呼呼族 以及森林里所有动物
And so all ended well, for both Horton and Whos,

1062
01:16:47,629 --> 01:16:50,996
甚至袋鼠妈妈，都过得幸福美满
and for all in the jungle, even kangaroos.

1063
01:16:51,066 --> 01:16:54,331
这件事教导我们每一个人
So let that be a lesson, to one and to all.

1064
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:58,999
万物生而平等，不论他们有多渺小
A person's a person, no matter how small.

1065
01:17:16,558 --> 01:17:19,186
我再也无法克制这份情感
And I can't fight this feeling anymore

1066
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,252
我喜欢这样唱，快一点
Yeah, I like this. Faster, more up-tempo.

1067
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:24,356
我已忘记我是在抗拒什么
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1068
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:26,424
我无法克制这份情感
I can't fight this feeling

1069
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:29,698
是时候该让我这艘船停靠你岸头
It's time to bring my ship into your shore

1070
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:30,829
好比喻!
That's a metaphor!

1071
01:17:30,906 --> 01:17:32,032
抛开船桨
And throw away the oar

1072
01:17:32,107 --> 01:17:33,199
又一个比喻
Another metaphor!

1073
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:35,106
买个引擎
And buy an engine

1074
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,180
我再也无法克制…这份情感
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore

1075
01:17:40,248 --> 01:17:42,182
从头到脚
From the weight of my trunk to my toes

1076
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,117
我已忘记我是在抗拒什么
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1077
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,711
你不该抗拒什么，享受人生
Well, you shouldn't be fighting anything. Enjoy yourself.

1078
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:50,952
就算我得匍匐在你脚下
If I have to crawl across the floor

1079
01:17:51,059 --> 01:17:53,721
-撞穿你家那扇烂门 -撞穿你家大门
- Now, break down your stupid door - Crashing through your door

1080
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:56,628
我再也无法克制这份情感
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1081
01:17:56,732 --> 01:17:58,029
空着肚子怎么克制
On an empty stomach

1082
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,364
我无法克制这份情感
I can't fight this feeling

1083
01:18:00,435 --> 01:18:02,630
我无法克制这份情感
I can't fight this feeling

1084
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,443
我随便乱唱的啦
I'm just saying words.

1085
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:12,880
唱歌的感觉真好，真是太爽了!
That felt so good. Cathartic!

1086
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:14,876
怎样？
What?
