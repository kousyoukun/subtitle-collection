1
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:10,921
Yeah!

2
00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:14,057
On the 15th of May, in the jungle of Nool,

3
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:17,433
in the heat of the day,
in the cool of the pool,

4
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,940
he was splashing,
enjoying the jungle's great joys,

5
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:27,769
when Horton the Elephant
heard a small noise.

6
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:39,586
- Horton!
- Horton!

7
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:42,659
Good morning, class. Are you ready?

8
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:44,787
- Yeah!
- Jump on board!

9
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,494
Look out below!

10
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,433
Tommy's on board. Katie, you there?

11
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,806
Okay.

12
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,244
There it is.

13
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:03,510
This is one of the jungle's most
amazing creatures, the leaf bug.

14
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:08,280
In order to protect itself from predators,
it disguises itself as a leaf.

15
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:17,426
This one's got quite a grip.
Come on, little buddy.

16
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,987
Don't be shy.

17
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:24,033
I guess I was mistaken, kids.

18
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:27,662
There are obviously no leaf bugs
in this area. Even if...

19
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:29,469
No, they're on me!

20
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,606
I think I swallowed one!

21
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,807
Tommy! Pull it out!

22
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,546
Uh, okay.

23
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,560
Then humpfing a '"humpf'"
was a sour Kangaroo,

24
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,687
the type who's convinced
she knows better than you.

25
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,961
She made every law
and enforced every rule

26
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:58,299
as self-proclaimed
head of the jungle of Nool.

27
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,570
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?

28
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:03,164
How many times have I told you that

29
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:06,508
the jungle is no place
to act like a wild animal.

30
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,814
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.

31
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:22,794
And the children are learning
so much from him.

32
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:26,059
Learning to be a bunch
of harebrained half-wits!

33
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,234
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch-schooled.

34
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:32,366
So while Kangaroo stood there,
sneering a sneer...

35
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,406
Horton, that was the best time
I've ever had in my life!

36
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,030
What are you gonna show us next?

37
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:40,076
...once again, the speck floated
right by Horton's ear.

38
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:44,415
Then he heard it again,
just a very faint yelp,

39
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,985
as if some tiny person
were calling for help.

40
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:52,088
And you know what he thought?

41
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,022
Why, he thought that
there must be someone

42
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:56,994
on top of that small speck of dust!

43
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,395
Or even a family, it just might be so,

44
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:02,229
a family with children
just starting to grow.

45
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,330
I want to live!

46
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,772
I gotta go. Katie, you're in charge!

47
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,346
Wait!

48
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,510
- Come back!
- Watch it!

49
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:47,940
One more! One more! One more!

50
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,918
- I hear someone coming!
- Give me those!

51
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:00,182
- Wait!
- Sound the alarm!

52
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,362
Excuse me. Pardon my stampede!

53
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:10,625
Sorry, Wickershams! I promise
I'm gonna clean all this up later!

54
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,295
Bring the ammo!

55
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:23,905
I love the smell of bananas in the morning.

56
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:27,115
Banana in the hole!

57
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:30,412
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!

58
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:36,761
I feel the diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.

59
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,091
There you are! I got you!

60
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,069
Hi, kids!

61
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,175
Wow.

62
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:02,348
There.

63
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:04,916
Now you're safe.

64
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,450
I know I heard you say something.
I just know it.

65
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,821
Where are you?

66
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:21,798
Horton!

67
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:23,136
Sorry!

68
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:29,180
I just... There was this speck,
and it called out for help.

69
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:31,876
- And I was...
- The speck called out for help?

70
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:35,351
Well, not the speck.
I mean, that's ridiculous.

71
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,491
Is that what you thought I meant?
No, the speck can't call out for help.

72
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:42,788
Come on, get real.

73
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:48,131
No, there's a tiny person on that speck
that needs my help.

74
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:52,293
Absurd. There aren't people that small!

75
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,870
Well, maybe they aren't small.

76
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:57,640
- Maybe we're big.
- Horton.

77
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,170
No, really, think about it.
What if there was someone way out there

78
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,147
looking down on our world right now?

79
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,516
And to them, we're the specks.

80
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:09,516
And then, maybe someone else
will come along and say,

81
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:12,022
"Oh, there can't be people that small",
and the first guy would say,

82
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,183
"Are you calling me a liar?"

83
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,988
And the second guy would say,
"If the shoe fits, wear it!"

84
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,530
And now the fists are flying,
and the first guy picks up a brick,

85
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:21,327
and you might want to zip up the pouch
for this next part.

86
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,231
"All right, fat boy,
you want some of this..."

87
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:24,530
- Horton!
- What?

88
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:27,003
There is nothing on that speck.

89
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:30,339
- But I heard.
- Did you?

90
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,741
Really? Oh, my.

91
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,841
Then how come I don't hear anything?

92
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,080
Well...

93
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:43,485
If you can't see, hear or feel something,

94
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:45,251
it doesn't exist.

95
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:48,418
And believing in tiny, imaginary people

96
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:52,726
is just not something we do or tolerate,

97
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:54,823
here in the jungle of Nool.

98
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:59,361
Really? Because I bet if I really tried,
I could find somebody who'd believe

99
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,167
- what I've been saying.
- You will do nothing of the sort.

100
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,337
You will not breathe a word of this lie
to anyone else, especially the children.

101
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:10,246
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.

102
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:13,742
Our community has standards, Horton.

103
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:17,949
If you want to remain a part of it,
I recommend you follow them.

104
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,220
Have a nice day.

105
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:28,264
All right, then,
I'll take that under advisement.

106
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,028
Certainly appreciate your input.

107
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:36,039
I don't understand. I know I heard you.

108
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,073
It was as plain as the nose on my face.

109
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:42,504
That's it. Maybe you can't hear me.

110
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:47,618
Of course! Your ears must be tiny.
I need to speak up.

111
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:53,355
Hello!

112
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:56,088
Now some people out there,
I think I know who,

113
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,221
may find they agree
with that sour Kangaroo.

114
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,198
'"There can't really be people
as small as a mite. '"

115
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,070
Well, there can, and there are,
because Horton was right.

116
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,449
Hello!

117
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,085
That single '"hello'" traveled
all the way down

118
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:30,390
to the speck, through the clouds,
until it found a small town.

119
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:34,226
A town known as Whoville,
for there lived the Whos,

120
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,633
feeling happy and safe,
knowing only good news,

121
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:41,264
unaware that their world
was a speck on a clover,

122
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,400
unaware that the sweet life
they knew might be over.

123
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:45,967
- Over!
- Under!

124
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,807
The Mayor of Whoville,
a man named McDodd,

125
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,512
was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.

126
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:16,130
The Mayor and his wife,
they had children to spare,

127
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:19,643
96 daughters, some here and some there.

128
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,413
96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach,

129
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,781
but the Mayor had only
a few seconds for each.

130
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,690
Daddy, I got better than best
on my Who-story test.

131
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,919
Who-story. I remember it well.

132
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,518
That's one of my girls.

133
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,826
- Hildy's been using my hairbrush!
- Holly's been using my hairbrush!

134
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,593
Look! Over there!

135
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,192
There. All better.

136
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:48,034
Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad?
Everyone else in my class has one.

137
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,005
Oh, really? Everyone?

138
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,679
I will think about it.

139
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,873
Daddy, look! Daddy, look!

140
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:02,813
Toof.

141
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:04,879
It's a "T-H", sweetheart. It's "tooth."

142
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,882
In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,

143
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:10,689
the Mayor's oldest is next
in the Mayoral line.

144
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,196
And who was the oldest?
To lead and stand tall?

145
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,462
It was JoJo, his son,
the smallest Who of all.

146
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:21,666
So, JoJo, what's shaking?
What's happening? What's the word?

147
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:25,203
Now, to you or to me, it's abundantly clear

148
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,371
that JoJo did not want his father's career.

149
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:32,214
But the Mayor pressed forward,
completely deluded,

150
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,820
while JoJo just sat there in silence
and brooded.

151
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,087
Oh, JoJo!

152
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,521
- Hey, why does he get more time?
- That's not fair.

153
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,032
Son! Hey!

154
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,590
And why didn't he speak?

155
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:54,469
Well, I think that the lad was afraid
if he did, he might let down his dad.

156
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,741
You know what's awesome?

157
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,707
This is awesome.

158
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:03,339
Just look at the men and women
hanging on these walls.

159
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:09,348
You, my boy, are part of a family legacy
that spans centuries.

160
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:14,586
You know what?
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville,

161
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:20,264
and your great-grandmother, that's right,

162
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,327
all the way down to your

163
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:29,037
great-great-great-great-not-so-great-

164
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:33,442
great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-

165
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,048
grandfather.

166
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,683
Someday I hope to join them.

167
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:44,385
Be one of the greats.

168
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:48,917
I tell you, JoJo, there is nothing
like being Mayor.

169
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:52,896
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets,

170
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:57,732
and in the Edible Parade, I'm the one
sitting on top of the giant meatball.

171
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:03,232
Someday, that can be you, too, JoJo.

172
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:08,440
Someday you'll be the one wearing
the Mayoral Crest.

173
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,380
You just... You just need to...

174
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,720
You know what I mean?

175
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,647
Okay. Good chat.

176
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:24,055
I'm glad that we had this talk

177
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:29,267
that I'm continuing now by myself. Good.

178
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:38,907
There. That ought to be comfy.

179
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:47,252
Nothing wrong with this, Morton.
Nothing wrong with this.

180
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,219
Just you, me and the speck,
shooting the breeze.

181
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:56,925
We're a club. We're a group.
We can take a vote on the issues.

182
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:01,057
We can be a secret society that controls
the balance of power in the world.

183
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,600
- Horton.
- And no one else can join,

184
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,932
unless they wear funny hats.

185
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,901
Listen, Horton!

186
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,499
The Chair recognizes Brother Morton.

187
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,137
I am really happy you found
this speck and all,

188
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:20,179
but you might want to think
about keeping it to yourself.

189
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:22,151
What? Why?

190
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,817
Well, you're talking to a clover.
That doesn't look good.

191
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,352
You know what doesn't look good?

192
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:34,660
You talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.

193
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:37,702
The speck never said anything bad
about you.

194
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:40,863
But, hey! Good luck
with your illusion of superiority.

195
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:45,501
You know, the speck can think anything
it wants about me. It's a speck.

196
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,777
I see what's going on here.

197
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:53,484
Morton, no matter how tight
the speck and I get,

198
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,446
the speck could never replace you.

199
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:00,020
I'm only sad that I would have
to explain that, at this point.

200
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,856
Well, that's awesome, Horton.
That really helps.

201
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:07,322
Just try to keep this to yourself.

202
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,828
I'll see you later. Try.

203
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,375
Hey, Horton! What you got there?

204
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:19,000
What? Nothing!

205
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,538
We're not doing anything.

206
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,914
- We're totally alone.
- Who's "we"?

207
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,383
"We"? What? "We"? Did I say that?
I just... Oh.

208
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,181
No, I would never say that,
because that would imply that

209
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:31,814
I was with someone, and not alone.

210
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:40,859
Okay, seriously, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.

211
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:44,868
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very, very bad.

212
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,501
I'm not sure why.

213
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,639
We won't tell anyone.

214
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,405
And if we do,
we'll tell them not to tell anyone.

215
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:55,308
Perfect!

216
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,071
Okay, I'm taking a bath, right,

217
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,241
'cause my skin gets kind of dry
and a little bit ashy.

218
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:02,081
While Horton came clean about
the speck that he'd found

219
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,382
and how he had saved it
when it nearly drowned,

220
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,253
the Mayor set off on his morning commute

221
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:09,589
and noticed things weren't quite
the same on his route.

222
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:14,098
But please don't blame Horton, for he
didn't know that a small bump above...

223
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,190
...and I dove in the water like this!

224
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,931
...was a big bump below.

225
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,671
Hey, Joe, don't work too hard.

226
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:27,007
These luxury condos,
they don't build themselves.

227
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:34,116
Hey, look at that!
I guess they do build themselves.

228
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,619
Okay, that happened.

229
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,617
Now, the Mayor knew it was his job
to convey the unusual things

230
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:47,256
that he'd noticed that day,
but there was one problem.

231
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:49,197
Though his will was strong...

232
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:51,202
- You're late.
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.

233
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,803
...nothing in Whoville
had ever gone wrong.

234
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:58,240
We have all that we need.
We need all that we've got.

235
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,474
We like it in Whoville. We like it a lot!

236
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:06,449
We're all very busy with
the Who-Centennial coming up,

237
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:09,248
so let's bring this meeting to order.

238
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:13,488
Mr. Mayor, I presume you
have some good news for us.

239
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,452
Well, it's news.

240
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:21,090
I don't know if we need to go labeling it
"good" or "bad" or anything like that.

241
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:26,399
The thing is, I have noticed
some odd goings-on in Whoville lately.

242
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:28,269
Good "odd goings-on"?

243
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:32,271
Well, you know, tremors,
clouds swirling in the sky.

244
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,141
And it seems to me, just to be safe,

245
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:37,147
we might want to consider
postponing the Who-Centennial.

246
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,773
Consider what?

247
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,649
Postponing the Who-Centennial.

248
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,985
What? Speak up, man!

249
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:48,192
Postponing the Who-Centennial! All right?

250
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:13,850
We are about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness and harmony,

251
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,147
and you want to postpone the celebration?

252
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,813
Well, what if Whoville's not safe?

253
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,882
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville,

254
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:25,487
never has and never will,
you blathering boob!

255
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,069
The Who-Centennial will proceed
as planned!

256
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,404
The Mayor was merely being an idiot.

257
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:40,569
It will be all smiles from now on.

258
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:45,373
That hurt!

259
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,849
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.

260
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,822
What? What do you mean,
it don't look like me?

261
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:56,520
That looks just like me 10 years ago.
Wait a minute. Hold on for a second.

262
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,859
Treats me like an idiot. I am not an idiot.

263
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,263
Do I look like an idiot?

264
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:12,835
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I am not an idiot.

265
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:17,075
Has the nerve to call me a boob?
I would never call somebody a boob.

266
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,241
He's a boob! Look at you.

267
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,012
Yuck!

268
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,115
Look at your face.

269
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:27,448
And I bet you don't look so good
with a stapler in your head!

270
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,369
Whoa! Whoa.

271
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,805
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.
- You're welcome.

272
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:48,470
Hello?

273
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:52,380
Who said that? Back off! I'll punch you!

274
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:03,219
Hello?

275
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:07,591
Hello.

276
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:16,306
Who's there?

277
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:17,933
This is the Mayor.

278
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,771
The Mayor? The Mayor!

279
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,707
I'm talking to the Mayor!

280
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:28,978
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
I knew there was life on this speck.

281
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:31,313
"This speck"? What speck?

282
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:36,157
Well, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, but...

283
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:39,720
You're living on a speck.

284
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,428
Well, I hate to disagree with you,
O voice from the drainpipe,

285
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,494
but I live in Whoville.

286
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:49,100
Well, then, Whoville's a speck.

287
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,232
Right.

288
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,142
Okay, seriously, who is this?

289
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:55,076
Is this Burt from accounting?

290
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:59,116
No. This is Horton. I'm an elephant.

291
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:02,515
Okay, "Horton."

292
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,919
Fake name. Where are you?

293
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,326
Well, from where you're standing,
I guess I'm in the sky.

294
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:12,494
Compared to you, I'm enormous.

295
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:15,157
Which is saying something,
because I've slimmed down quite a bit.

296
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,495
I swim.

297
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:21,267
Your whole world fits on a flower
in my world.

298
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,304
Oh, man, this is even pushing it
for you, Burt.

299
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:27,512
Don't believe me? Watch what happens
when I put you in the shade.

300
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,842
This is absolutely impossible...

301
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:31,108
Dark.

302
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:33,175
Light.

303
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:34,845
Dark.

304
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:38,845
Light. Dark, light, dark, light,
dark, light, dark.

305
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:41,220
Light!

306
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,152
Don't you see?

307
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:47,992
We're in the middle of some kind of
amazing cosmic convergence.

308
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:52,865
Two vastly different worlds,
miraculously crossing paths!

309
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:55,663
Mine, colossal! Yours, miniscule.

310
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,539
Yet somehow we've managed
to make contact.

311
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:01,736
If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.

312
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,715
Is everything okay down there?

313
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:13,248
I don't know. You tell me.
You're the one holding the speck.

314
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,558
I'm the one holding the speck.

315
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:18,519
I'm the one holding the speck.

316
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,258
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.

317
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:24,100
Hold, please!

318
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:29,866
What did all of this mean?
The Mayor hadn't a clue.

319
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:35,345
So he ran to the office of Dr. Larue,
the brainiest brain on the staff at Who U.

320
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:36,745
Dr. Larue!

321
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,380
This is crazy.

322
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:42,010
Mr. Mayor.

323
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:44,915
How may I be of assistance?

324
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:47,514
I don't know. Hey, you know,
I was just wondering

325
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:52,359
if our world were, say, a tiny speck
floating through space,

326
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:53,455
how would we know?

327
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:55,294
Well, why would you ask
something like that?

328
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,597
No reason. No reason at all.
I don't even remember.

329
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:00,762
Yes, I do. You know what?

330
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:02,806
Some guy was talking to me.

331
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:05,706
Not an elephant in the sky.
A guy on the ground.

332
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:08,143
There would be several ramifications.

333
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:10,077
Good ramifications?

334
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,474
A tiny speck?

335
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,113
Yeah. Tiny speck.

336
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,915
Floating around.

337
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:23,318
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors,
dramatic changes in the weather,

338
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:27,829
and if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability,

339
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:31,425
our world would be destroyed!

340
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,303
Destroyed? Destroyed. Oh, destroyed.

341
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:42,307
Horton!

342
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:44,948
No, this is Benny.

343
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:48,152
Horton is busy right now.

344
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,154
No. I'm joking.

345
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,753
That's me.

346
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:53,924
We're doomed.

347
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:58,122
Listen, Horton, turns out
I need your help a little bit.

348
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:00,494
Apparently, if that speck
keeps moving around,

349
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,295
our whole world could be obliterated.

350
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:09,001
So I need you to find us Whos
a safer, more stable home,

351
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:10,165
and fast.

352
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,371
No problem, Mr. Mayor. Let's see...

353
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,442
Wow, that's a nice view.

354
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:23,044
Hello. Is everything okay?

355
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:33,988
What's going on up there?

356
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:51,940
This entire jungle is a house of death!

357
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,183
Oh, wait. There's a good spot.

358
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,785
And it's then Horton saw
at the top of Mount Nool,

359
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:02,122
a small cave that looked peaceful
and quiet and cool,

360
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:05,288
where a sunflower grew proud and tall
from the ground.

361
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:09,527
There, he knew every Who would be safe,
would be sound.

362
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:13,001
I found it, Mayor. The perfect place.

363
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,200
Right up there,

364
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,570
- on the top of Mount Nool.
- Mr. Mayor?

365
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,573
I wish you could...

366
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:22,539
Shiny.

367
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,544
The Who-Centennial Committee
is waiting for you

368
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,814
to look over the giant meatball
for the Edible Parade.

369
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:32,721
And then you're due at the dentist
for your Who-root canal.

370
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:37,022
You know, sticking "Who" in front
of everything doesn't make it hurt less.

371
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:39,029
Just wastes time!

372
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:40,928
I don't want to go.

373
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,061
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go.

374
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,364
Apparently, there's a problem
with the giant meatball.

375
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:52,234
You just take care of that meatball, sir,
and leave the freaking out to me.

376
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:55,245
So then Horton began
his long, perilous trek,

377
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,612
determined to save the small world
on the speck.

378
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:02,111
Horton was faithful and stalwart and kind.

379
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,687
I got you.

380
00:26:03,755 --> 00:26:05,689
He was a brave hero...

381
00:26:05,757 --> 00:26:06,781
I'll protect you!

382
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:08,256
...at least in his mind.

383
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,954
We must become invisible. Travel silently.

384
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:13,895
For there are forces
that would seek to destroy us.

385
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:23,306
So you think you can sneak up
on me, huh?

386
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:28,443
It is clear that you are no match
for my technique.

387
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:35,277
I see you have mastered the way of the
snapping branch. Watch me tumble!

388
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,286
Morton Mouse, go!

389
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,325
You are fast, Horton,
but the Kangaroo has monkeys.

390
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:45,226
I will make monkeys of these monkeys.
It is their destiny.

391
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,920
More clover!

392
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,625
Horton is the greatest hero of them all!

393
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:52,794
- Horton!
- Morton!

394
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:53,928
Go!

395
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,572
But Mount Nool is that way.

396
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:02,977
To the top of Mount Nool!
As fast as lightning! Away, I go.

397
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:07,114
Sorry, little fellow.

398
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,782
You'll be fine. Just think healing thoughts.

399
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:17,427
- Horton! Look!
- Horton! Look, look, look!

400
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,492
We've all got our own clovers
with worlds on them!

401
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,793
Yeah.

402
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,530
In my world, everyone's a pony,

403
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:30,870
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies.

404
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:34,941
That's beautiful, Katie.

405
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,175
In a really weird way.

406
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,153
My world is called Jessica-land,
and everyone worships Queen Jessica

407
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:45,985
because Jessica is so beautiful.

408
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:48,890
Jessica, that was awesome.

409
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,126
- Rudy!
- Mom, be careful!

410
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,565
My best friend Thidwick lives on that.

411
00:27:56,668 --> 00:28:00,695
Rudy, no one lives on this.
It's not possible.

412
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,801
That Horton is a menace.

413
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,069
Mom, Mom! Please, you're so weird.
Don't do this to me.

414
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,700
Honey, go to your room.

415
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,073
Horton!

416
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:12,911
It's good!

417
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:14,848
What do you think you're doing?

418
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,477
You guys with worlds are in trouble!

419
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:20,752
- Have you forgotten what we discussed?
- Oh, no. I'm an elephant,

420
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:23,191
and elephants never forget.
It's a curse, really.

421
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:25,161
I remember I was on my head,
and you said "Humpf,"

422
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,857
and I looked up, and you said,
"What are you doing?"

423
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:28,193
And I said the thing about the speck.

424
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,359
Then you pulled my ears
and you poked me in the forehead...

425
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:32,426
- Horton!
- Well, you did.

426
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:35,597
Give me that clover, Horton. Now!

427
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:38,201
No.

428
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:42,839
No?

429
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:45,343
Yeah.

430
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:48,614
Are you sure you want to fight
this fight, Horton?

431
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,384
Because I promise you
it will get very ugly, very fast.

432
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,892
And you need to ask yourself,

433
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,396
"Do I really want
to put myself through all this?

434
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:01,523
"For a clover?"

435
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,464
Take it from me, Horton.

436
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:04,967
You don't.

437
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,065
So hand it over!

438
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:12,402
No! I can't give it to you.

439
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,039
There are people on this speck.

440
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:16,876
Granted, they're very small people,

441
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:19,815
but a person's a person,
no matter how small.

442
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:29,252
You just crossed the line, Horton,
and I'm gonna make you pay.

443
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,394
That Horton is a menace.

444
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:40,233
He has those kids using
their imaginations.

445
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:41,169
It's sick.

446
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:45,940
All right, I gotta get this speck
up to the top of Mount Nool, ASAP,

447
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:50,743
whatever that means. Probably,
"Act Swiftly, Awesome Pachyderm."

448
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:53,079
I mean, how hard can that be?

449
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,483
It's just a straight plummet
to certain death.

450
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:07,427
This looks kind of precarious.

451
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,628
Well, no need to worry.

452
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:12,892
Obviously, when they build a bridge
like this,

453
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:16,839
they take into account
that elephants will be crossing here.

454
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:22,641
All right. Feels good.
I'll just get the feel of it!

455
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,757
That's true.

456
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:52,470
Oh, God.

457
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:55,536
Hello. And how are we today, Mr. Mayor?

458
00:30:57,448 --> 00:30:59,109
Say, "Ah."

459
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,019
Rinse, please.

460
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:19,633
I think a few of these boards could
stand to be replaced.

461
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,310
I just need to think light.
I'm light as a feather.

462
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:36,250
I'm light as a feather!

463
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:44,861
Heavy feather.

464
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:49,197
Okay, this will just pinch a little.

465
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:54,368
I'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?

466
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,841
Air! There's nothing lighter.
So it stands to reason

467
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,773
that the more air I have,

468
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:09,846
the lighter I'll be.

469
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,155
Next, please.

470
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,226
All right, that was absolutely terrifying.

471
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:59,394
If I just pull myself up!

472
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:03,804
Try not to panic.

473
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:26,195
That could've been a disaster.

474
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:34,327
Wow. I feel really good right now.
Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.

475
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,228
All right.

476
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:05,035
Hey, JoJo! I need your help.
Can you help me?

477
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:09,095
Okay, great. Okay.
First, I need you to go to the girls' room.

478
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,532
Take down Hanna's china doll collection
and then...

479
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:12,768
Stop looking at my arm.

480
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,368
Put away Holly's light bulb collection,
and then...

481
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:18,779
You know what? Just take care of
anything that might break or shatter.

482
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,781
Okay, take a good long look.

483
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,180
Got it? Thanks, JoJo!

484
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:36,896
Here. And... Take that. And...

485
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,073
Hi. You're home late.

486
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:51,848
Sorry, hon. I was just having some
dental work done on my arm.

487
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,008
So, what was...

488
00:34:53,084 --> 00:34:54,244
Ned!

489
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,817
What are you doing?

490
00:34:58,022 --> 00:34:59,387
What do you mean?

491
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,653
Well, I'm no detective, Ned,
but you are hanging from the chandelier.

492
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:03,819
I just thought it might look better

493
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:07,262
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crush us in our sleep.

494
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,697
What is going on?

495
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,601
Hey, hon,

496
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,944
did you ever get the feeling
that you were being watched?

497
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:27,874
Yeah, sure. I suppose.

498
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:32,184
And then you get the feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is

499
00:35:33,624 --> 00:35:35,387
a giant elephant?

500
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,229
And you know how
you get that weird feeling

501
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:42,289
that your world is actually a tiny speck?

502
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,635
And that the elephant that I talked about
earlier is carrying it around on a flower.

503
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:52,971
And you realize that if you tell anybody,
they'd think you were crazy.

504
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:57,741
But you still feel a responsibility
to keep everyone safe.

505
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,250
You know that feeling?

506
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:04,083
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.

507
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:06,282
Do you know that feeling?

508
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:10,619
No.

509
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,667
Yawn. Wow. I am beat.
Time to hit the hay, I guess.

510
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:20,301
Sweetheart, I know
you're under a lot of stress,

511
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:25,266
and if you're seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.

512
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:28,437
Just don't tell anyone else
that story, okay?

513
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:31,504
And remember,
it's not the end of the world.

514
00:36:33,851 --> 00:36:35,682
"The end of the world."

515
00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:39,948
Horton to Mayor. Horton to Mayor.
Come in, Mayor. Over.

516
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,521
Horton?

517
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,926
I get terrible reception here.

518
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:50,931
How about this?
If I get up real close, can you read me?

519
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:56,197
Yep! Roger that.

520
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:58,468
Are we at that safe place yet?

521
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:02,201
Almost. I'm pretty sure
the worst part's over.

522
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:04,110
This is your elephant speaking.

523
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,708
Just sit back, enjoy the ride, and
we'll have you to Mount Nool in no time.

524
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:09,786
No, you can't have ice cream for breakfast.

525
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:10,878
- Please.
- Please.

526
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:12,182
Who's that?

527
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,780
Is there someone else there?

528
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,053
Well, that's my wife and kids.

529
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,684
You have a family.

530
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:24,059
I do, indeed. A beautiful wife,
96 daughters, and one son.

531
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:25,859
Oh, busy guy.

532
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:28,828
And we all share one bathroom.
You know how that is.

533
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:31,366
Yeah. Don't I know it.

534
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:33,674
Bathroom?

535
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,239
- Ned!
- What?

536
00:37:35,346 --> 00:37:38,975
Sweetheart, you know
you're on the roof, right?

537
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,142
- Please, Mom.
- What's that?

538
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,583
No, you need to go to bed.
Daddy's having a breakdown.

539
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,848
Ned, what are you up to now?

540
00:37:44,922 --> 00:37:48,255
I was just about to put the kids to bed
when I got off the roof.

541
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,192
And that's what happened. Right.

542
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:09,578
- Daddy?
- Yes.

543
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,376
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.

544
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,042
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

545
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:17,879
Me, 28.

546
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:19,115
Okay.

547
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:25,959
Hey, JoJo!

548
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:31,294
A lot of liquid. A lot of liquid.
Just the person I wanted to see.

549
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:36,271
Yeah, I realize that we have not
been seeing eye-to-eye lately,

550
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,308
and most of it is my fault.

551
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:39,433
It's true.

552
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:41,306
You know what I've been trying to do?

553
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:45,439
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.

554
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,449
Let me make this perfectly clear.

555
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:53,080
JoJo, you can be whatever
kind of Mayor you want to be.

556
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,887
Hands-on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.

557
00:38:56,961 --> 00:39:00,089
Well, good. I feel so much better.

558
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:04,190
I am expecting big things from you,
young man. Big things.

559
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:06,099
All right. Good night.

560
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:08,137
Good stuff. Good talk.

561
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,087
Then JoJo snuck out,
feeling lonely and sad,

562
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,058
and tragically misunderstood by his dad.

563
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,278
And where was he going
at such a late hour?

564
00:39:50,748 --> 00:39:53,945
Up to Whoville's abandoned
Star-Studying Tower,

565
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:58,617
a place where the boy felt contented, free.

566
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,658
A place he could be what he wanted to be.

567
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:06,926
And what was inside there,
I'd say if I could.

568
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:10,694
But up above, the Kangaroo
was up to no good.

569
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:19,801
Can I come out now, Mom?

570
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,936
No, Rudy. Stay in your room.

571
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:24,173
- But, Mom...
- Stay inside.

572
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,725
Mr. Vladikoff?

573
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:52,035
Eating. Go.

574
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:56,341
Yes, I realize you're busy,
but I need your help.

575
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,178
It's Horton.

576
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:01,013
He's become obsessed with a clover.

577
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:04,646
And he actually thinks
there are little people on it.

578
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:09,184
I want that clover destroyed.

579
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,423
Sure. What a big deal this is for you, bro.

580
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:18,858
I'd do it myself, but being a lady,
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

581
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:22,404
But I hear you have no problem with that.

582
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:24,900
No.

583
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:28,209
No problem. Easy peazy.

584
00:41:28,712 --> 00:41:32,239
But I will only do this for a price.

585
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:35,113
In exchange for a brand new pair of...

586
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,014
No.

587
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:40,713
This little kangaroo.

588
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,557
- Mom!
- Quiet, Rudy. Mommy's thinking it over.

589
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,397
Well, thanks, but on second thought,

590
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:52,924
I think I'm going to have
the Wickersham brothers

591
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:54,265
take care of this for me.

592
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:57,272
Yeah, of course, Wickersham.
I mean, they're a classy operation.

593
00:41:57,374 --> 00:42:00,366
You know, they do... Wait! No!
You can't go with Wickersham!

594
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:04,642
No, no, no, the Wickershams would
be perfect for this job.

595
00:42:04,748 --> 00:42:08,275
But they're monkeys! Is not scary!

596
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:12,151
Thanks, anyway. Maybe next time.

597
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,382
Wait!

598
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:16,917
Here is what I will do to precious clover.

599
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:20,327
I will take it, I will crush it,

600
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:23,229
and I will devour it.

601
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:31,840
Bigger than it look.

602
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:33,341
One second.

603
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:36,643
Holy moly.

604
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:39,175
Hang on.

605
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:44,250
Then I regurgitate it.

606
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:48,087
Then I'm going to devour it second time!

607
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,316
So, two times devoured.

608
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:55,192
Sounds nice, but I think
I'll talk to the Wickershams.

609
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:56,659
Wait!

610
00:42:57,835 --> 00:42:59,598
Here is best part.

611
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,970
I do all gratis.

612
00:43:04,942 --> 00:43:06,637
That's free, bro.

613
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:09,206
What do you think?

614
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,107
Deal.

615
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:17,119
Yes! Score. Thanking you.
You won't regret.

616
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,250
Mayor!

617
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:55,989
Mayor!

618
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,427
Open up, Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

619
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:03,594
It's snowing! In the summer!

620
00:44:08,706 --> 00:44:10,901
Yes. Yes, it is.

621
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:13,169
It's a dramatic change in the weather,

622
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:15,837
as if we were a speck,
floating through space.

623
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:19,610
I don't know how you knew,
but somehow you did,

624
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:24,745
and Whoville is headed for disaster.

625
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,950
Horton.

626
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:28,115
What?

627
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:30,090
Nothing. I'm on it.

628
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:33,254
It's up to us to save
the people of Whoville.

629
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:40,102
You're small, but there are a lot of you!

630
00:44:40,904 --> 00:44:42,303
That's it.

631
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,770
Okay, anybody else?

632
00:44:46,543 --> 00:44:47,703
Good.

633
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:53,273
No, no. No enjoyment. This is not fun.
It is a sign of doom!

634
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:56,810
Aw, sweetie, that's...

635
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,480
No, no, no! Danger! Danger!

636
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:04,553
Stop having fun immediately!

637
00:45:04,628 --> 00:45:06,994
This is dangerous! Okay!

638
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:10,895
Stop it!

639
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:19,737
Horton!

640
00:45:27,985 --> 00:45:29,418
Hey, Mayor.

641
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:31,618
We're in big trouble down here.

642
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,486
It's happening!
It's snowing in the middle of summer.

643
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,149
It's the end of the world!

644
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:43,099
Hold on, Mayor.
I think I know what your problem is.

645
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:55,808
There. That better?

646
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:00,175
That seems to have worked.

647
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:02,809
Do I smell peanuts?

648
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:06,822
Yeah, they're my favorite snack,
but they tend to linger.

649
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:13,689
Finwick, no!

650
00:46:15,332 --> 00:46:18,324
Hang on, Mr. Mayor.
I may have to put up a fight.

651
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,700
A frightened elephant can be
very dangerous!

652
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:24,638
All right!
You've called down the thunder, buddy!

653
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:29,304
You hungry for trouble? I'm an
"All you can eat" salad bar! Take a bite!

654
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:33,877
I hate running.

655
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:35,349
Morton!

656
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:37,717
Don't do that.

657
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:39,049
Horton!

658
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:42,654
Horton! There you are!

659
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:45,251
We got trouble! Wait, stay, wait!
Did you hear that?

660
00:46:45,362 --> 00:46:50,561
No, I'm here, okay. Listen. No! Go!
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.

661
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,500
She's telling everyone that
you should be kicked out of Nool.

662
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,334
She said that?
I thought we were her friends.

663
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:58,533
Word is she's gone to Vlad!

664
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:01,942
Vlad? Vlad? I know two Vlads.

665
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:06,038
Is it the bad Vlad
or the bunny Vlad that makes the cookies?

666
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:09,677
Yeah, Horton, she's sending you
a bunny with cookies.

667
00:47:09,753 --> 00:47:12,688
I think we can assume it's the bad Vlad.

668
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:14,220
Yeah, that's a good call.

669
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:19,388
So unless you're cool
with giant, razor-sharp claws

670
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:23,194
ripping the flesh off your body,
I'd get rid of the clover!

671
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:26,259
I can't! I promised the Mayor.

672
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,271
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant,

673
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,933
and an elephant's faithful, 100%.

674
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:37,241
Please. For me, just this once.
Be faithful 99% of the time.

675
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:41,751
I've never gotten 99% on anything,
and I think I'm awesome! So, come on!

676
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:45,584
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant.

677
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,283
I'm not gonna say it.

678
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:51,384
You can do that all day,
it's not happening.

679
00:47:52,062 --> 00:47:53,393
An elephant's faithful, 100%.

680
00:47:53,463 --> 00:47:58,127
That's right. That's my code, my motto.
But thanks for the warning.

681
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:00,503
Motto. Okay.

682
00:48:00,604 --> 00:48:02,469
But watch the skies.

683
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:05,770
Keep watching the skies!

684
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:12,577
Mayor, you need to get
everyone underground.

685
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:13,673
Now!

686
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:16,314
I don't want to sound the alarm,

687
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,445
but there's a good possibility
we may be attacked

688
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:21,491
- by a giant carnivorous bird.
- What?

689
00:48:21,592 --> 00:48:24,925
There's a small chance it could be a bunny
with cookies, but I wouldn't count on it.

690
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:28,530
They are formidable.

691
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:30,623
Mayor? Are you there?

692
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:34,093
Yeah. No. That's a great idea. It's just...

693
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:38,369
In order to get everyone mobilized,
I'd need the okay of the City Council,

694
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:41,035
and they never listen to me.

695
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:43,169
I've been called a boob,

696
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,180
several times. I can't do it!

697
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:48,112
You have to talk to them, Mayor!
Okay. Listen.

698
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:52,044
Bad Vlad!

699
00:48:52,155 --> 00:48:53,452
Bad Vlad!

700
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,649
Bad Vlad!

701
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:05,224
That is definitely not a bunny.

702
00:49:13,043 --> 00:49:17,309
Lost him. Meant to lose him,
and I lost him. Good.

703
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:24,348
Is this tree for real? Come on!

704
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:27,413
Hang on, Whoville!
This is gonna get rough!

705
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:40,699
Now you're going to get it!

706
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:43,763
Get ready for the best!

707
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,068
Leave me alone!

708
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:54,514
Horton!

709
00:50:06,263 --> 00:50:08,026
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.

710
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:09,292
Hello.

711
00:50:29,786 --> 00:50:31,219
Chess mate.

712
00:50:31,955 --> 00:50:34,321
Now it's time for me to take clover

713
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:37,154
and crush all the little people on it,
who are saying...

714
00:50:37,294 --> 00:50:40,661
Sorry. This is where we get off.

715
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,896
Right in the beak!

716
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:50,968
Cool line. Usually I can't think
of those things till later.

717
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:53,438
- Mayor?
- Horton.

718
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:54,902
Are you okay?

719
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:04,253
Well, more or less. What happened?
The bird?

720
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:08,522
Yeah, it attacked me.
Mayor, your people are in danger.

721
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:11,985
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

722
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:15,360
I'm going to go out there
and tell them what is going on.

723
00:51:15,465 --> 00:51:17,626
Perfect. Now, quick. Get going.

724
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,801
Hey! Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!

725
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:29,141
- My basement's in the attic.
- The Science Museum is history.

726
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:33,046
- The lost and found is missing.
- What's going on, Mr. Mayor?

727
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,482
I'm declaring a state of emergency!

728
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:38,544
Don't worry! Don't worry!

729
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:41,215
The Mayor is just being a moron.

730
00:51:41,324 --> 00:51:44,691
No, wait! Whoville is in terrible danger!

731
00:51:44,795 --> 00:51:48,697
Everyone needs to get down to the
underground storage area immediately.

732
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:50,699
Fine! Fine!

733
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:53,395
Let's do this democratically.

734
00:51:54,304 --> 00:51:57,796
Who wants the joy and glory and festivity

735
00:51:57,874 --> 00:52:01,571
of the Who-Centennial
to proceed as planned?

736
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:03,809
Yeah!

737
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:07,477
And who, like the Mayor,

738
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,248
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-Centennial

739
00:52:11,354 --> 00:52:14,721
in an underground storage area?

740
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:16,882
Yeah!

741
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:20,429
Wait! You've gotta listen to me!

742
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,522
Our whole world could explode!

743
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:29,997
Much more quickly!

744
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:33,371
And our world wouldn't make that noise.

745
00:52:34,778 --> 00:52:37,713
The people have spoken, Mr. Mayor.

746
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:42,111
You're finished. No one believes you.

747
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:44,346
No one supports you.

748
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:48,215
Horton believes me.

749
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,553
Horton?

750
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:52,692
Who's Horton?

751
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:58,697
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky!

752
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:00,593
Don't bother looking, he's invisible.

753
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:04,572
And he's the one risking his life
to get Whoville,

754
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:09,374
which, by the way,
is a speck on a clover, to safety!

755
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:22,391
I can prove it!

756
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:25,451
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.

757
00:53:30,066 --> 00:53:31,090
Horton!

758
00:53:32,302 --> 00:53:35,567
I have all the Whos
gathered in town square!

759
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:37,573
Let them know you're there!

760
00:53:38,575 --> 00:53:42,136
Gee. This is kind of
a high-pressure situation, then.

761
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:47,944
Wow. I am really drawing a blank here.

762
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,315
I know!

763
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,752
Horton!

764
00:53:55,425 --> 00:53:57,359
Horton, we're waiting!

765
00:53:58,094 --> 00:54:00,358
Time to show everyone that you exist,

766
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:04,763
and by extension, what a non-boob I am.

767
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:12,970
Wait!

768
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:17,980
Everyone, look at the wind.
What do you think that that means?

769
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:20,382
It means...

770
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:23,213
It means, obviously...

771
00:54:24,054 --> 00:54:27,217
Let the kite-flying race begin!

772
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:47,376
What a burn on you, Horton!

773
00:55:44,868 --> 00:55:46,301
Brain freeze.

774
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:57,312
Give me back my speck!

775
00:55:57,414 --> 00:55:59,211
Not this time, guy.

776
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:11,418
I am so sorry that I let you down,
but this... This is bigger than me.

777
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:14,657
Get the family together
and get somewhere safe.

778
00:56:15,298 --> 00:56:18,096
I will! I believe you.

779
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:26,439
I've got you now, elephant.

780
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:29,810
No, no, no!

781
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:43,019
Oh, no!

782
00:57:10,854 --> 00:57:12,014
Mayor?

783
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,212
Anybody there?

784
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,618
Hello?

785
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:18,989
Anyone?

786
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:22,889
But clover by clover by clover, he found

787
00:57:22,999 --> 00:57:26,400
that the one he sought for
was just not around.

788
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:28,630
Mayor?

789
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,798
Hello?

790
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:35,470
And by noon, poor Horton,
more dead than alive,

791
00:57:35,545 --> 00:57:39,845
had picked, searched and piled up 9,005.

792
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:42,181
Hello?

793
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:44,850
Sorry to bother you,

794
00:57:45,054 --> 00:57:46,385
nobody.

795
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,383
Knock, knock.

796
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:56,321
This is where you'd say, "Who's there?"

797
00:57:56,399 --> 00:57:59,596
If there were any Whos there.

798
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:03,705
Get it? "Whos there."

799
00:58:07,944 --> 00:58:11,277
All day he looked, looked on and on,

800
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:15,074
until his hope was almost gone.

801
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:18,544
No, no, no! Please, no!

802
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:21,450
This isn't fair!

803
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:28,591
But, wait, could this one be the one?

804
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:31,428
Was all his searching finally done?

805
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:34,264
Ah, yes, for this was the hour.

806
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,601
Horton had found them
on the three millionth flower.

807
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:40,107
Mayor! Mayor!

808
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,075
I found you!

809
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:46,245
Mayor?

810
00:58:46,616 --> 00:58:48,106
Are you there?

811
00:58:48,284 --> 00:58:49,546
Mayor?

812
00:58:53,556 --> 00:58:54,784
Mayor.

813
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,731
Mayor, are you there?

814
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:08,168
Mayor!

815
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,168
Mayor?

816
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:19,141
Mayor?

817
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:24,453
Mayor!

818
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:34,623
No, this is Floyd.

819
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:37,796
Can I take a message?

820
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:44,798
Mayor! You're okay!

821
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:50,279
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!

822
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,009
Sorry.

823
00:59:55,118 --> 00:59:58,849
It must have been rough down there.
I can't believe I found you.

824
00:59:58,955 --> 01:00:01,048
You really had me worried.

825
01:00:02,058 --> 01:00:04,390
Say! The Mayor was right!

826
01:00:04,494 --> 01:00:06,792
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

827
01:00:06,863 --> 01:00:09,957
Okay, I'm all right, and so are you.

828
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:17,530
Citizens of Whoville!

829
01:00:19,676 --> 01:00:23,874
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.

830
01:00:28,051 --> 01:00:29,985
He's going to help us!

831
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:33,682
I've got this.

832
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:36,020
This is the Chairman...

833
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:37,184
Idiot!

834
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,229
You're finished in this town!
Is that understood? Finished.

835
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:41,888
You boob!

836
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:45,367
I'm just joking.

837
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,031
Good one.

838
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:53,200
Horton, this is my wife Sally.

839
01:00:53,276 --> 01:00:54,573
You exist!

840
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:57,077
This means my husband isn't crazy.

841
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,738
Hooray!

842
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:03,080
And a few of my daughters,
Haley, Holly, Hooly, Hilda and Hedy.

843
01:01:03,186 --> 01:01:04,346
- Hi!
- Hi!

844
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,947
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.

845
01:01:08,057 --> 01:01:10,685
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us!

846
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,227
And Burt from accounting,

847
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:15,025
and Mrs. McGillicuddy, and Mr. Farfoogan

848
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:17,032
from the Clugan Farfoogans,

849
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,863
and the old man in the bathtub.

850
01:01:18,935 --> 01:01:20,698
Let's not overwhelm the poor fellow.

851
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,533
He's never gonna remember
all these names.

852
01:01:22,605 --> 01:01:25,540
Well, I'll try my best.

853
01:01:26,476 --> 01:01:28,774
Sally, Chairman,

854
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:31,073
Haley, Hooly, Holly, Hilda,
Hedy, Miss Yelp,

855
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:34,082
Dr. Larue, Burt from accounting,
Mrs. McGillicuddy, Mr. Farfoogan

856
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,314
of the Clugan Farfoogans,
and wasn't there an old guy in a shower?

857
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:39,718
Bathtub.

858
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:41,882
- Yeah!
- We're all here, Horton,

859
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:46,254
and we all believe in you.

860
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:49,088
Wow. That's awesome.

861
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:51,998
And it's a responsibility
I do not take lightly.

862
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:56,265
I promise you a future
that is safe, sound and stable.

863
01:01:56,339 --> 01:02:01,641
We will create a world where every Who
is endowed with three inalienable rights,

864
01:02:01,744 --> 01:02:03,336
to be determined at a later date.

865
01:02:04,781 --> 01:02:09,650
And we will put a speck on Mount Nool
before the end of this decade.

866
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,661
This elephant is crazy! Oh, my goodness.

867
01:02:19,762 --> 01:02:23,459
I gotta tell everybody.
I need to get to the Kangaroo.

868
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,434
Wait till they find out about...

869
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:30,261
You should have been seeing me.
I really let elephant have it.

870
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:35,106
I chase him, I torment him, I break him
into million little elephant pieces.

871
01:02:35,678 --> 01:02:39,546
It was thing of beauty, really.
My best work. Classic Vlad.

872
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:40,775
And the clover?

873
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:44,684
Clover is finished!
No way in million years Horton find it.

874
01:02:44,787 --> 01:02:48,518
Read my beak. Clover is gone forever.

875
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,796
I just saw Horton,
and he is still talking to that clover!

876
01:03:01,804 --> 01:03:02,896
Idiot!

877
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:07,704
Whoa! Come on, I'm your bro!
It's me you're talking to. We have history!

878
01:03:08,478 --> 01:03:11,538
Come on, let's not forget,
I did this for free!

879
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:15,678
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?

880
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:19,416
There once was a time
when people were people

881
01:03:19,522 --> 01:03:21,513
and specks were specks.

882
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:26,352
Well, I say, "If you can't see it,
hear it or feel it,

883
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:28,226
"it doesn't exist!"

884
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:32,033
Our way of life is under attack!

885
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:35,593
And who is leading that attack? Horton!

886
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:38,333
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

887
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:40,773
Wait a minute!
This is Horton we're talking about.

888
01:03:40,877 --> 01:03:43,846
You all know him, he wouldn't hurt a fly.

889
01:03:43,913 --> 01:03:48,179
Except for that fly city he sat on.
But he didn't do that on purpose.

890
01:03:48,251 --> 01:03:49,843
Shut up, mouse!

891
01:03:50,753 --> 01:03:54,587
That's weird. My brownies are burning.
I gotta go!

892
01:03:55,758 --> 01:04:01,219
Are we going to let troublemakers like
Horton poison the minds of our children?

893
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:03,094
Not the children!

894
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:08,432
When Horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,

895
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:10,768
he makes them question authority!

896
01:04:10,873 --> 01:04:14,900
Which leads to defiance!
Which leads to anarchy!

897
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:17,468
Yeah! Horton must pay!

898
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,047
It's that speck!

899
01:04:19,115 --> 01:04:20,980
We have to do something!

900
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,414
For the children!

901
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:23,884
For the children!

902
01:04:23,953 --> 01:04:28,890
Are we going to let him
get away with this?

903
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,983
No!

904
01:04:31,227 --> 01:04:32,956
Let's go!

905
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:00,011
Morton! I told you! 100%!

906
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,816
Horton!

907
01:05:01,924 --> 01:05:04,324
Morton, pick up your feet! Jeez.

908
01:05:04,427 --> 01:05:05,951
It's not me!

909
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,696
I see. It's an angry mob. Sorry, Morton.

910
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:14,201
I thought it was you
that was making all the...

911
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:15,702
But it's...

912
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:17,437
Oh, darn.

913
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:20,431
Run, Horton!

914
01:05:21,344 --> 01:05:22,834
There he is!

915
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,445
Let's rope him!

916
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:27,141
Let's cage him!

917
01:05:28,517 --> 01:05:31,543
No! No! No!

918
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,684
Stop!

919
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:40,288
Hey, fellas. Good to see you,

920
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:41,796
all at once.

921
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,531
You look really great as a horde.

922
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:45,624
Horton, Horton, Horton,

923
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:49,398
look at the mess
you've created for yourself.

924
01:05:49,505 --> 01:05:53,236
All this hullabaloo over a silly little flower.

925
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:55,333
It's a speck.

926
01:05:55,811 --> 01:06:00,578
Right. I mean, it's silly, really,
all this talk of roping you,

927
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:05,052
and caging you, and, well,
we don't need to go into the details.

928
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:10,251
The point is, this angry mob,
all the trouble you're in,

929
01:06:10,359 --> 01:06:12,384
it can all go away.

930
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,563
- Really?
- Of course.

931
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:23,165
All you have to do is admit to everyone
that there are no little people

932
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:25,070
living on that speck.

933
01:06:25,174 --> 01:06:28,610
That you were wrong and I was right.

934
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:34,944
You do that and things can go right back
to the way they were.

935
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:41,887
But if you don't, you're going to
have to pay the price.

936
01:06:49,565 --> 01:06:52,227
So, I just have to say it isn't true?

937
01:06:57,406 --> 01:07:01,536
Go ahead. Rope me, cage me.
Do whatever you want.

938
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:03,968
But there are people on this speck.

939
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:08,574
And they have a Mayor, who has
96 daughters and one son named JoJo,

940
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:11,711
who all share a bathroom,
whatever that is,

941
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:16,582
and even though you can't hear
or see them at all,

942
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:19,992
a person's a person, no matter how small.

943
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,835
That was beautiful, Horton.

944
01:07:30,306 --> 01:07:32,171
Rope him! Cage him!

945
01:07:32,274 --> 01:07:36,506
And burn that speck
in a pot of boiling Beezlenut oil!

946
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,941
They don't believe we're here.

947
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:45,179
We've got to make some noise!

948
01:07:45,287 --> 01:07:47,517
We are here! We are here! We are here!

949
01:07:47,623 --> 01:07:49,750
We are here! We are here! We are here!

950
01:07:49,825 --> 01:07:51,452
We are here! We are here! We are here!

951
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:52,960
Come on!

952
01:07:53,496 --> 01:07:56,021
- Everybody!
- We are here! We are here! We are here!

953
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:58,327
We are here! We are here! We are here!

954
01:08:06,842 --> 01:08:10,835
This will teach you not to make up stories
about people on specks!

955
01:08:10,946 --> 01:08:13,312
Listen! There they are!

956
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,050
- Rope him.
- Cage him!

957
01:08:19,622 --> 01:08:21,283
It's not working.

958
01:08:21,624 --> 01:08:24,058
I can hear you,
but their ears aren't strong enough.

959
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,821
We need to be louder!

960
01:08:25,895 --> 01:08:29,023
Get every Who to make noise! Everyone!

961
01:08:29,131 --> 01:08:32,726
We are here! We are here! We are here!

962
01:08:32,835 --> 01:08:34,962
JoJo! Where are you going?

963
01:08:35,137 --> 01:08:38,231
We need every voice! JoJo!

964
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:46,078
You need to make some noise down there,
or we'll all be destroyed!

965
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:50,352
The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom
and started to smack it,

966
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:54,886
and all over Whoville,
they whooped up a racket.

967
01:08:57,059 --> 01:08:59,721
They rattled tin kettles!
They beat on brass pans!

968
01:08:59,829 --> 01:09:02,320
On garbage pail tops
and old cranberry cans!

969
01:09:02,398 --> 01:09:05,367
They blew on bazookas
and blasted great toots.

970
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:08,870
On clarinets, oompahs,
and boompahs, and flutes!

971
01:09:11,674 --> 01:09:12,868
There!

972
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,343
Can they hear us now?

973
01:09:16,879 --> 01:09:21,009
Listen, please.
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

974
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,948
I don't hear nothing!

975
01:09:23,419 --> 01:09:26,013
I don't think so. But keep trying.

976
01:09:27,223 --> 01:09:29,054
I'll never give in!

977
01:09:33,195 --> 01:09:37,291
Are you sure that every Who down
in Whoville is trying?

978
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,773
We are here! We are here!

979
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,399
Where's JoJo?

980
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:49,876
Probably at the old observatory.

981
01:10:03,425 --> 01:10:05,256
Hey! There's a limit!

982
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:15,435
That's not supposed to stretch that far!

983
01:10:24,947 --> 01:10:26,278
JoJo!

984
01:10:26,782 --> 01:10:28,306
You built this?

985
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:22,293
We are here! We are here! We are here!

986
01:11:22,371 --> 01:11:25,499
We are here! We are here! We are here!

987
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:30,637
We are here! We are here! We are here!

988
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:39,554
You're making a mistake.

989
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:42,915
But, Mom!

990
01:11:43,025 --> 01:11:45,858
This doesn't concern you, sweetie.
Back in your pouch!

991
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,400
Everybody! Don't stop!

992
01:11:56,171 --> 01:11:58,571
Keep going! This is gonna do it!

993
01:11:58,674 --> 01:12:03,008
We are here! We are here! We are here!

994
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:04,238
Can they hear?

995
01:12:04,346 --> 01:12:05,438
No!

996
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:17,718
No matter what happens,
I couldn't ask for a better son.

997
01:12:21,397 --> 01:12:23,058
Hey, JoJo!

998
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,860
Come on! Keep going!

999
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:32,400
No!

1000
01:12:37,379 --> 01:12:40,974
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1001
01:12:44,653 --> 01:12:45,745
No!

1002
01:12:52,227 --> 01:12:54,627
Yopp!

1003
01:13:00,469 --> 01:13:05,964
We are here! We are here! We are here!

1004
01:13:07,109 --> 01:13:08,974
I hear it! I hear it!

1005
01:13:09,445 --> 01:13:10,639
They are there!

1006
01:13:10,746 --> 01:13:15,479
And that Yopp,
that one small extra Yopp put it over,

1007
01:13:15,584 --> 01:13:18,417
and all the Who noises
burst out of the clover.

1008
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:20,284
- I hear it!
- Me, too!

1009
01:13:22,324 --> 01:13:24,815
Rudy. Give me that! Come...

1010
01:13:27,329 --> 01:13:30,662
Rudy. Get back in the pouch. Now!

1011
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:34,699
No, Mom.

1012
01:13:36,805 --> 01:13:39,035
Wickershams! Get that clover!

1013
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:44,806
Anybody! Take it from him!

1014
01:13:56,358 --> 01:13:58,986
You did it, Mayor. You did it.

1015
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:01,726
We did it!

1016
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,391
Yeah!

1017
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,664
Well done, son.

1018
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,737
All right, Mayor!

1019
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:18,839
Dad, you're one of the greats!

1020
01:14:22,985 --> 01:14:25,647
Whoa. Easy, everyone! Easy!

1021
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:28,689
Hi, Vlad.

1022
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,687
Well, I shouldn't, but...

1023
01:15:03,392 --> 01:15:05,622
Oh, man, that is nice touch.

1024
01:15:06,395 --> 01:15:10,957
I am a mess with this, right?
Emotional! Here come the waterslide.

1025
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:14,864
There's so many people to thank.

1026
01:15:14,937 --> 01:15:16,700
The good people of Nool,

1027
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:18,899
who put me in a cage
and poked me with sticks.

1028
01:15:18,974 --> 01:15:20,134
That was me!

1029
01:15:20,242 --> 01:15:23,405
My buddy Morton, for being the only one
who stood by me.

1030
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:24,638
Well, not right by me.

1031
01:15:24,746 --> 01:15:28,409
He hid in the bushes,
sending me good thoughts. He's small.

1032
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:30,781
Dude, you are a warrior poet.

1033
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,919
And most of all, I'd like to thank
the Mayor of Whoville,

1034
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,480
who believed in me from the beginning.

1035
01:15:36,592 --> 01:15:40,153
Horton, we're going to miss you.

1036
01:15:42,464 --> 01:15:44,159
What are we gonna do
without you, Horton?

1037
01:15:44,566 --> 01:15:47,467
Don't worry. I'll always be around.

1038
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,596
And even as I wander

1039
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:54,141
I'm keeping you in sight

1040
01:15:54,243 --> 01:15:56,677
You're a candle in the window

1041
01:15:56,778 --> 01:15:58,803
On a cold, dark winter's night

1042
01:15:58,914 --> 01:16:00,245
Beautiful metaphor.

1043
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:02,613
And I'm getting closer

1044
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:07,451
Than I ever thought I might

1045
01:16:07,956 --> 01:16:10,186
That's a little high for me.

1046
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:15,423
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1047
01:16:15,964 --> 01:16:21,197
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1048
01:16:21,803 --> 01:16:24,636
And if I have to crawl upon your floor

1049
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:26,003
Crawl upon the floor

1050
01:16:26,108 --> 01:16:27,507
Come crashing through your door

1051
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:28,837
Crashing through your door

1052
01:16:28,944 --> 01:16:32,277
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1053
01:16:32,347 --> 01:16:39,048
I can't fight this feeling anymore

1054
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:47,520
And so all ended well,
for both Horton and Whos,

1055
01:16:47,629 --> 01:16:50,996
and for all in the jungle, even kangaroos.

1056
01:16:51,066 --> 01:16:54,331
So let that be a lesson, to one and to all.

1057
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:58,999
A person's a person,
no matter how small.

1058
01:17:16,558 --> 01:17:19,186
And I can't fight this feeling anymore

1059
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,229
Yeah, I like this. Faster, more up-tempo.

1060
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:24,356
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1061
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:26,424
I can't fight this feeling

1062
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:29,698
It's time to bring my ship into your shore

1063
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:30,829
That's a metaphor!

1064
01:17:30,906 --> 01:17:32,032
And throw away the oar

1065
01:17:32,107 --> 01:17:33,199
Another metaphor!

1066
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:35,106
And buy an engine

1067
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,180
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore

1068
01:17:40,248 --> 01:17:42,182
From the weight of my trunk to my toes

1069
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,117
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1070
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,711
Well, you shouldn't be fighting anything.
Enjoy yourself.

1071
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:50,952
If I have to crawl across the floor

1072
01:17:51,059 --> 01:17:53,721
- Now, break down your stupid door
- Crashing through your door

1073
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:56,628
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

1074
01:17:56,732 --> 01:17:58,029
On an empty stomach

1075
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,364
I can't fight this feeling

1076
01:18:00,435 --> 01:18:02,630
I can't fight this feeling

1077
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,443
I'm just saying words.

1078
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:12,880
That felt so good. Cathartic!

1079
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:14,876
What?
