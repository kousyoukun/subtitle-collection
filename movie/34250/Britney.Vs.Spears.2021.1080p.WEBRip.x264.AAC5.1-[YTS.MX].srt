[Britney] When I was 8,
my mom realized I could sing.

14
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,445
I've always wanted to sing.

15
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,572
It's just something
I've always wanted to do.

16
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,908
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…

17
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,660
[woman 1] It's not just luck.
Everybody needs a little bit of luck.

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,330
But it's literally an Olympian level

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,166
of talent and hard work
that goes into that.

20
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,461
[woman 2] Everything about her
was strong and fearless.

21
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,505
I mean, there was no stopping her.

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,760
[woman 3] It all exploded
after Britney became famous.

23
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,638
[woman 4] Suddenly,
she was spiraling out of control,

24
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,557
and it was clear she was having a crisis.

25
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,893
[reporter] Are you concerned
for your daughter, Mr. Spears?

26
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,979
[woman 4] What began
as temporary control over her life

27
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,982
and her money and her business
became permanent.

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,070
[woman 3] They felt they had to do it
to protect Britney.

29
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,364
[man 1]
Britney is no longer a free person.

30
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,950
[woman 2]
She doesn't have basic human rights.

31
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,494
She can't write a check
or have a credit card.

32
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,580
[man 2] If she doesn't behave,
she loses custody of her kids.

33
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,210
[man 3] There's other people that've tried
to help. They've paid a heavy price.

34
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,132
[woman 2] She is limited
on how she can voice her wishes.

35
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,761
[Britney] I just want my life back.
And it's been 13 years and it's enough.

[video call ringing]

00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:45,456
All right, so let's do
our least favorite thing in the world,

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,210
which just means
calling random strangers and saying,

39
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,421
"Hey, can you talk to me
about Britney Spears?"

Hi, Kim, my name is Erin Lee Carr,
and I'm a documentary filmmaker.

43
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,223
I'm directing a project about Britney.

44
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,728
Two years ago, I began making
a movie about Britney Spears

45
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,313
with journalist Jenny Eliscu.

46
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,107

-Hey, this is Jenny Eliscu.

47
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,194
I'm not sure if you remember me
from, uh, years ago.

48
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,239
We met when I was working
on a Rolling Stone article about Britney.

49
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,492
[Carr] The movie was going to be about
her artistry and the media portrayal.

50
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,954
And can someone say wow
to those dance moves?

51
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,416
[emotional music playing]

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,381
But the story was also about power
and control.

53
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,927
Full of conspiracy and rumors.

54
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,637
And no one would talk.

55
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,474
Until they did.

56
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,731
I was 10 when Britney came on the scene.

57
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,111
I remember grabbing the CD with a flower
on it that's Baby One More Time

58
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,780
and putting it into my boombox.

["Sometimes" playing]

60
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,950
You know, my dad would knock on the door.

61
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,662
And he said, "Why are you listening
to this over and over again?"

I love her.

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,555
[Carr] At 16 years old, Britney was
a sensation and she was no one-hit wonder.

68
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,521
From 1998 to 2003, her worldwide
record sales totaled over $73 million.

69
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,150
Britney had a work ethic like none other,

70
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,403
but she's never been motivated by money.

71
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,072
She just was doing something she loved.

72
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:45,118
[woman 5] She was in control
and involved in every process.

73
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,247
I'm open to ideas. If they come up with
something better, then heck, I'll do it.

74
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,916
[woman 5] She was like, "I'm the boss.
I'm gonna do what I want."

I'll be able to support my family,
no matter what.

00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
[woman] Britney Spears!

80
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:14,605
[Carr] By 2004, she was one of the biggest
selling female artists of her generation.

81

Hit after hit.

82

[camera shutters clicking]

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,287
Then, suddenly,
Britney stopped making music.

85
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,957
She fell in love with a backup dancer,
Kevin Federline.

86
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,837
On a transatlantic flight,
Britney proposed to Kevin.

87
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,676
They got married
and quickly had two children.

88
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,307
But two years later, the marriage was over
and Britney had filed for divorce.

89
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,809
It's the biggest news in the country,
ladies and gentlemen.

[Carr] Britney was out on the town,
looking as confident as ever.

94
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,407
Now hopefully,
with her divorce almost finalized,

95
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,868
she would get back to performing for us.

96
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,124
But what seemed like the beginning
of her regaining control…

97
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,127
was really the end.

[pensive music playing]

99
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,723
The very first time
I was assigned Britney,

100
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,018
she was in the middle
of this divorce with Kevin.

101
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,896
I was working for an agency, okay?

102
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,816
They gave me the address.
They said, "Sit outside the house."

103
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,776
"When she comes out, follow her."

104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,656
My job was to take pictures of her, right?

105
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,536
That period, I was a photographer,
and, you know, I was good at it.

106
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,956
I excelled
and I learned the job real quick.

107
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,707
[paparazzi yelling]

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,298
This is a job for adrenaline junkies
and those with a gambling addiction.

109
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,927
There's nothing sexier
than waking up and they say,

110
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,220
"This is your assignment."

111
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,180
You open it up and don't know who it is.

112
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,642
Male, female,
actor, singer, sports celebrity.

113
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,561
So, as a photographer,

114
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,982
you can get a few hundred thousand dollars
for a picture of Britney.

115
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,569
[Eliscu] At the time of the divorce,

116
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,613
Britney was relentlessly chased
by the paparazzi.

117
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,576
At the same time,
she had friendships with some of them.

118
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,953
[Ghalib] Beautiful.

119
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,747
One night, the agency calls me

120
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,958
and tells me
the gas station that Britney's at.

121
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,251
I drive down there.

122
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,379
At the gas station,
everyone's taking pictures.

123
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,591
Twenty dollars' worth of gas.

124
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,093
[Ghalib] She was having problems
with the gas.

125
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,261
You want me to fill it?

126
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,181
I asked Britney, "Can I help you?"

127
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,892
So I start doing it.

128
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,901
And then, one day a photographer calls me
and says, "Britney's asking for you."

129
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,611
"What do you mean, she's asking for me?"

130
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,156
Then another photographer calls me
who doesn't know the first photographer.

131
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,867
And he's like,
"Hey, bro. Britney's asking for you."

132
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,328
-Where's--? You, come here.
-[man] Back it up.

133
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,414

She felt safer.

134
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,041

138
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,924
I'll let him know.

139
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,766
[Ghalib] It was a very simple,
very easy relationship, you know?

140
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,437
But between her fans and everybody else,
it was like I was the bad guy.

141
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,398
Oh, my Lord.

142
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,277
[Ghalib] Like that Disney story,
you always want the Prince Charming to be

143
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,532
as equally as attractive and equally
as beautiful and equally as charming.

144
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,575
We didn't have that balance.

145
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,578
There was this multimillionaire and me.

[indistinct chatter]

147
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,999
And then there was this famous girl,
and then there was me.

There was this white girl,
and there was me.

149
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,091
There were nights where she was up

150
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,718
and I had to stay up with her,
and it's hard.

151
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,679
To stay up for three days, it's hard,

152
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,473
but you have that fear,
it's a very real fear,

153
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,475
that if anything happens to her,

154
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,104
they're just gonna blame you.
It's just so much easier to blame you.

155
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,650
She was taking Adderall.

156
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,988
I'm sure x-amount of millions of people
are taking Adderall.

157
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:37,785
But these are the things
that become volatile and deadly weapons

[dramatic music playing]

162
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,852
[Ghalib] What was apparent to me
during this divorce with Kevin

163
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,522
was, you know, she never had one person
she could trust, not one.

Not Mom, not Dad,
not friends, not her sister.

166
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,197

The hearing this afternoon had to do
with a continued interim,

00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,923
or temporary order,

170
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:37,928
that was based on Mr. Federline's
original request to modify custody.

171
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,514
[man] Hold on. Hey, hey.
Get back. Get back, sir.

172
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,434
-[man 1] You guys have got to get back.
-[man 2] Britney!

173
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,977
[man 3] We love you, Britney!

174
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,440
[Carr] By 2007, Britney's divorce
from Kevin was heating up.

175
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,862
What many thought would be a simple case,
guided by a strong prenuptial agreement,

176
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,906
now seemed to be in question.

177
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:02,036
Ironclad prenup's a little bit like
the Titanic could never sink.

178
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,248
For every ironclad prenup,
there's a group of attorneys out there

179
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,875
that will try to tear it apart.

180
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,253
[Eliscu] Mark Vincent Kaplan,
he's the K-Fed lawyer.

181
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,466
He's like this kind of old guard,
bigtime custody lawyer

182
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,345
you might call
in a contentious divorce custody case.

183
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,306
He seemed to love being the spokesperson

184
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,143
for this high-profile divorce
and custody case.

185
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,814
And he definitely has a flair
for making a public statement.

186
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,985
The ultimate attack is,
how are the children doing?

187
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,029
How safe are the children?

188
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,573
The kids become just pawns.

189
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:44,704
Kevin is concerned that the more time
that the children are with him,

190
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,123
he feels the more insulated
they are from, uh…

191
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,420
risks that would otherwise be
constantly visited upon them.

192
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:57,425
People that care about the children
will provide information

193
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,177
that is relevant to their best interest.

194
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,889
There's nothing new, no new facts,
there's not an emergency?

195
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,433
All of those things are true.

196
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,311
I'd represented high-profile people
and celebrities before,

197
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:14,567
but this was an order of magnitude far
different than anything I'd experienced.

198
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,488
And I had to hit the deck running
and learn how to work with the media

199
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,199
so that they weren't working
against my client.

200
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,912
Kevin had been treated pretty unfairly.

201
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,749
They were saying,
"He's an unconcerned parent."

202
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:34,628
Other people were saying,
"Oh, he's just merely a gold digger."

203
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,381
He was in a position
of not being able to win.

204
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,717
Damned if he did, damned if he didn't.

205
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,553
[Carr] People wanted to sort of speak ill
of him or use him as a joke.

206
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,804
Why'd you think that was?

207
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:49,643
Well, keep in mind when Kevin
and Britney first got married,

208
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:55,149
she was America's sweetheart.
And in many respects, she still is.

209
00:12:55,232 --> 00:13:01,197
And they saw Kevin as someone
who in their view, whoever "their" is,

210
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,951
wasn't worthy of having that unique
relationship with America's sweetheart.

211
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,539
They attempted to penalize him for that
as much as they could and they--

212
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,249
The press was brutal.

213
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,002
But as the case progressed,

214
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,839
um, I think she did certain things

215
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:23,427
that the press found worthy
of a media frenzy.

216
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,513
[eerie music playing]

217
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,563
[Carr] As the custody case was battled out
in court, the media frenzy only grew.

218
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,944
Everyone seemed to have opinion
about Britney Spears.

219
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,363
The media focused less on her music

220
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,782
and more on the way
that she was living her life.

221
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,914
Britney cycled through legal teams,
and became more and more isolated.

222
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,335
There was a period of estrangement
between Britney and both of her parents

223
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,046
by fall of 2007.

224
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,757
I don't know how long
the estrangements were, where--

225
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,968
Whether there was maybe
sporadic communication,

226
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,137
but some sources I spoke to
talked about Britney

227
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,599
having a fear
that her family would barge in,

228
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,979
I think is how it was put,
and take everything.

229
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:20,317
I mean, and that's, you know,
that's how-slash-when Sam Lutfi got in.

230
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,444
[Carr] Who is Sam Lutfi?

231
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,825
[Eliscu] Sam Lutfi is the person
frequently blamed by both of her parents

232
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,244
for her public downfall.

233
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,790
[Carr] There was a lot of controversy
around Sam Lutfi

234
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,002
and what role he played
in this brief period of Britney's life.

235
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,549
First question.
Can you please introduce yourself to us?

236
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,011
-Uh, I'm Sam Lutfi.
-And who are you?

237
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,848
I'm Britney Spears's former manager.

238
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,978
[Carr] But in court documents
newly discovered from Britney's divorce,

239
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,064
she testified that he was
just her "friend sometimes."

240
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,901
Somebody who helped "get groceries."

241
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,534
In that time period,
he went from being the sometimes friend

242
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,953
to somebody calling the shots.

243
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,540
[Lutfi]
We met at a bar. We started talking.

244
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,167
She was very funny.

245
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,419
Uh, we had a great conversation.

246
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:25,007
Um, she had asked me
if I'd seen things that were in the press.

247
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,219
I said, "Of course. Like, who hasn't?"
You know, making light of the situation.

248
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,096
She asked for my phone number.

249
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,183
And then left and I never thought
I was gonna hear from her again.

250
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,561
Then I get a call from her one night
and she tells me,

251
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,646
"I need your help."

252
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,564
[woman] Hey, guys. Just be careful.

253
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,566
[man] Just clear this side for a second.

254
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,237
[Lutfi] You could see
that the divorce was impacting her a lot.

255
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,740
And my question to her the whole time was,

256
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,202
"I think the best thing would be
to have your family around."

257
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,162
"There's nothing
like having your mom around."

258
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:59,792
That's how it is in my life,
but I was just projecting that onto that.

259
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,503
Um, and she would just say,

260
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,423
"My relationship is not like
your relationship with your family."

261
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,343
I thought, "What's the issue?"
And so she would--

262
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,303
We would talk about Lynne,

263
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,681
uh, in depth.

264
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,809
So there was numerous issues
that were going on.

265
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,770
[Carr] And how was
her father Jamie involved?

266
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,605
Not at all.

267
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,817
Was it a short amount of time,
a long amount of time?

268
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,861
Uh, from what I believe, it's been years.

269
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,739
[paparazzi clamoring]

270
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,369
[Carr] In the eye of the storm
that was 2007,

271
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:39,623
Britney was still able to record
and produce an entire studio record.

274
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,505
[Carr] The album was Blackout
and it sold in the millions.

00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,549
It is widely considered her best work.

["Break the Ice" playing]

277
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,555
The music and the videos
from Blackout portrayed a pop-y version

278
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,683
of what had become
the story of Britney's real life.

279
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,645

This would foreshadow
a much darker turn for Britney.

282
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,238
There are paparazzi images
of Britney in 2007

283
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,241
that have been seen millions of times.

284
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,203
These images are often coupled
with headlines like,

285
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,956
"Meltdown" or "Rock Bottom."

286
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,044
Looking back,
you can see she was just a person,

287
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,880
a person who needed help.

[haunting music playing]

289
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,894
Throughout that year, paparazzi continued
to follow Britney aggressively

around Los Angeles.

291
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,985

Oh, my God.

to avoid them,

sometimes running red lights.

295
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,791
There were concerns
that if these car chases continued,

296
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,251
something terrible could happen.

297
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,718
A lot of people argue

298
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,763
that she was crazy, right?

299
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,516
You know, and I fucking hate that word.

300
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,435
Would you say she was upset,
would you say she was angry,

301
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,395
or would you say she was hurt?

302
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,606

[Carr] In January 2008,
police were called to Britney's residence.

307
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,899
She had locked herself in a room,

[Carr] At the hospital there was Kevin,
Mark Vincent Kaplan, his lawyer,

and Britney's father.

317
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,226
Britney's parents had been divorced
since 2002.

318

[Culotta] Britney was so close
with her mother.

When we were on tour,

320
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,483
I mean, she and Lynne talked at least--

321
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,486
Oh, gosh. At the very least,
two or three times a day.

322
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,363
[Carr] And what about her dad, Jamie?

323
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:43,742
Okay, I don't wanna talk about her daddy.
I don't wanna talk about Jamie.

324
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,993
Um…

325
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,790
The reason I don't--
I will tell you this just so we'll know.

326
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,252
Jamie wasn't with us very often,
hardly ever.

327
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,338
Um, so it really was me and Lynne.

328
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,342
[Carr] A few days after Britney
was released from the hospital,

329
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,718
a new figure emerged.

330
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,638
Her name was Louise Taylor.

331
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,850
And she went on The Today Show
as a spokesperson for the Spears family.

332

[Taylor] What I would like to say is that

333
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,941
I really feel like people
just do not know the Spears family.

334
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,278
What they don't know about Jamie
and Lynne Spears is that every day,

335
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,863
Jamie goes to work as a professional chef,

336
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,826
asking the Lord to give him the strength
to honor the people he works for

337
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,496
in the midst of circumstances,
that Lynne Spears is a mother

338
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,874
that is brokenhearted just because
she's apart from her daughter.

339
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,876
She loves her daughter so much.

340
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,880
And again, asking every day
for God to give her strength

341
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,174
and for her to continue to have hope.

342
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,887
I mean, I'm so disturbed, Meredith,
where we've gotten to be as a people,

343
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,808
the morbidity of us watching
the depravity of people suffering,

344
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,060
than to rally around and be hopeful.

345
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,939
So, really, for, I guess, for me
to be self-indulgent for a moment,

346
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,609
that I would really hope that all those
who seek God for strength in their life

347
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:03,155
would be interceding for this family
because Jamie Spears,

348
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,991
Lynne Spears, Bryan, and Jamie Lynn Spears

349
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,201
are all amazing people.

350
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,623
[Carr] From what I'd seen, no one had ever
spoken on behalf of the Spears.

351
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,460
[Carr] Who is Lou Taylor?

352
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,378
I will not touch that one.

353
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,590
Sorry.

354
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,801
She will chew me up
and spit me out. [chuckles]

355
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,721
[paparazzi chattering]

356
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,433
[Carr] The custody suit grew
more contentious

357
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:36,021
when the judge gave Kevin Federline
full custody of the two boys.

358
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,274
Soon thereafter,
Britney would return to the hospital

359
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,361
under another
involuntary psychiatric hold.

360
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,572
[man] Mr. Spears, what's going on?
How's Britney doing?

361
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,576
Can you give us any word,
any news on Britney?

362
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,581
[Carr] Jamie Spears petitioned
the State of California probate court

363
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,375
for a new legal arrangement.

364
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,921
It was called a conservatorship.

365
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,093
[dramatic music playing]

366
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:23,193
[Eliscu] I started working
at Rolling Stone in '99.

367
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,947
Britney was my second-ever cover story.

368
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,325
I didn't give a shit about Britney Spears
or pop music personally.

369
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,078
It's not something
I paid attention to at all.

370
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,418
Then I met her,
and she was just so likable and sweet.

371
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,548
So, in late 2008, when I was assigned
to do another cover story

372
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,508
on Britney for Rolling Stone,

373
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:50,512
I was excited 'cause I love her
and hadn't seen her in a few years.

374
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,556
And in spite of all of the drama,

375
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,267
I was just picturing it the same way
it always would be,

376
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,686
and, you know, went to L.A.

377
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,190
ready to spend some time
and started to get told by the label

378
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,443
that I'd have to submit
my questions ahead of time.

379
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,321
I said to the publicist,
"But it's me, me and Britney."

380
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,992
And she would say, "Oh, you know,
we know Britney loves you,

381
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,036
but we just--
The conservatorship, we've got to."

382
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,373
I was like,
"What the fuck is a conservatorship?"

383
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:29,801
A conservatorship is a legal process
for taking somebody's ability

384
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,304
to make their own decisions away from them

385
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:36,141
and giving them to some third party,
aka their conservator,

386
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,477
or in other states, it's the guardian.

387
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,191
Obviously, any process
to deprive someone of those liberties

388
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,276
and those freedoms would be something

389
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,571
we'd want to impose very rarely,
only as a last resort,

390
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,449
having tried
and exhausted all other alternatives.

391
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,120
Some people have called conservatorship
tantamount to a civil death.

392
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,291
There's conservatorship of the person,

393
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,169
which is allowing someone else
to make your decisions

394
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,463
related to your personal affairs.

395
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:10,342
They lose the ability to decide
anything related to their healthcare,

396
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,678
so their ability to provide
or withhold informed consent

397
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,599
for treatments, including drugs,
is taken away from them.

398
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,559
And, in many cases, they lose their right

399
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,312
to decide who to visit with
or receive visits from.

400
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,482
They lose their right to communicate
with people of their choosing

401
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,400
over the telephone, over the computer.

402
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,529
For a conservatorship of the estate,

403
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,490
which often goes
with the conservatorship of the person,

404
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,659
they're no longer in charge
of their money,

405
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,120
theoretically, even the $10
they might have in their pocket.

406
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,455
[camera shutter clicks]

407
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,875
[Eliscu] Jamie was made
the sole conservator of the person.

408
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,378
He had to share
the conservatorship of the estate

409
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,506
with a court-appointed attorney
named Andrew Wallet.

410
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,304
You had Jamie who had bankruptcy issues

411
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,474
and financial mismanagement
of his own life,

412
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,353
and they said, "We have Andrew Wallet
here as the co-conservator,

413
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,272
and has a fiduciary interest,"

414
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,856
but in court documents,

415
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,569
he talked about the conservatorship
as being a "hybrid business model."

416
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,654
[ominous music playing]

417
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,998
[Eliscu] According to the papers filed
with the court on February 6, 2008,

418
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,917
the conservators have access
to all documents and records

419
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,544
related to Britney's estate.

420
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,506
They can enter and take possession
of her house, kick people out,

421
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,010
they can issue restraining orders,
and employ security guards,

422
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,887
they can use Britney's money
to pay attorneys for matters

423
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,725
involving the estate,
open and operate businesses,

424
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,394
hire people for any position necessary,

425
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,355
and pay them using funds from the estate.

426
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,526
Why was Jamie made the conservator
and not Lynne?

427
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,945
Jamie is intimidating,
and people who have known him

428
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,530
and met him and worked with him,

429
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,616
and even had positive experiences
with him,

430
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,660
will still tell you
that he is very intimidating

431
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,830
and when he's angry,
you don't want to mess with him.

432
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,167
They were really in a moment

433
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,503
where they felt they needed
to keep away certain people,

434
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,840
and he was like the bouncer.
He could keep people out.

435
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,384
[Carr] Here we've got…

436
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,554
[Eliscu] Larry Rudolph,
Britney's longtime manager.

437
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:24,017
He started in 1996 as her attorney
and then grew into her manager.

438
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,187
But, uh, in April of 2007,
Britney fired him.

439
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,734
Larry was the main person
that Jamie Spears brought back

440
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,695
to get things running,
and he's been her manager ever since.

441
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,907
And he often will say
that he's not involved

442
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,202
with the conservatorship
or that he doesn't know what goes on,

443
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,663
that he only knows
what goes on with Britney's work.

444
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,669
Louise Taylor, aka Lou,
led business decisions at times

445
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,712
over the course of the conservatorship.

446
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,507
Louise Taylor's husband, Rob Taylor,

447
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,385
is the pastor
of a church called Calvary Chapel.

448
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,764
[man] Lou Taylor started appearing
around 2008,

449
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,058
before the conservatorship.

450
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,520
And we know this because
there is paparazzi footage of her

451
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,105
with Britney's father, Jamie.

452
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:18,196
And then she somehow managed
to become Britney's business manager.

453
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:24,703
She is a Christian, so they trusted her
a lot more because of that.

454
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,415
[Carr] Lou Taylor,
through her attorney Charles Harder,

455
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,583
sent me a pre-emptive legal letter

456
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:36,339
regarding any mention of Lou Taylor
or her company, Tri Star, in this film.

457
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,758
The letter was extensive.

458
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,708
When I got this notice, I was alarmed.

459
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,378
But receiving a letter
from Lou Taylor or her attorney

460
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,673
was not unusual
for people involved in the story.

461
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,344
While Lou's involvement
with Britney wasn't clear,

462
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,348
what was apparent was
that Jamie and Lou were very close.

463
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,935
Some sleuthing of Instagram
showed Lou and her husband

464
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,355
with Jamie on the day
of his baptism at the Jordan River.

465
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,611
This is paperwork
relating to Britney's condition

466
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,279
at the start of the conservatorship.

467
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,198
It's… It's kind of a standard form

468
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,326
where you indicate
what the person's impairment is

469
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,077
that requires a conservatorship.

470
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,996
Specifically, this is interesting to us

471
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,166
because it's orders
related to dementia placement.

472
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,251
[eerie music playing]

473
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,427
You don't usually see dementia mentioned
with, you know, with a young person.

474
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,938
This is one of the most important filings
in the entire conservatorship

475
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,733
because when someone is being made
a conservatee,

476
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,402
they're entitled to five days' heads-up,

477
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,198
so that if they want to contest it,
or find a lawyer, et cetera,

478
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,825
they have time to do that.

479
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,620
The only reason given
for depriving Britney of five days' notice

480
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:35,291
is that Sam Lutfi is dangerous
and needs to be kept away.

481
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,753
Don't push! Don't push.

482
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,506
Get off! Off! Off!

483
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,757
[camera shutter clicks]

484
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,553
[Craker]
It was total crisis mode with Sam,

485
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:50,515
and that is something that I don't believe
has really been portrayed correctly,

486
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,768
is the level of crisis

487
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,689
at the moment
that the conservatorship began.

488
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,941
Are you going to [bleep] get out?

489
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,443
Oh, my God,
please get the [bleep] out of the way!

490
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,196
Now I'm scared you're gonna drive off
without me.

491
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,740
Now get out of the passenger seat,
get out of the [bleep] car.

492
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,118
Get out, get out, get out. Thank you.

493
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,540
They felt they had to do it
to protect Britney from Sam.

494
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,209
We're sort of alluding to what happened,

495
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,004
that something dangerous
was happening with Sam.

496
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,381
What do you think was going to happen?

497
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,634
He was crushing drugs
and putting them in her food

498
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,138
-and bragging about it to…[Carr] And you 100% believe that?

499
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,765
Yeah.

500
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,521
[Britney] Drive my [bleep] car,
that's what I got to do.

501
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,569
You have a hundred blood tests
and drug tests.

502
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,488
The entire time I was with her,
she passed every single one of them,

503
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,658
which is why the police never came
to my door.

504
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,243
No one called the police.

505
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:56,748
To be char--
Accused of allegations that serious,

506
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:02,295
that you're drugging the world's
biggest star, you call the police.

507
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,589
You call the FBI. You don't call TMZ.

508
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,884
-I was the perfect scapegoat.
-[Carr] Why?

509
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,304
I was new. They didn't know who I was.

510
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,431
I was just an expendable guy.

511
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,434
Like, all right,
if that's what you need to get this done

512
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,811
and waive a five-day notice,
and explain a five-day notice,

513
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:24,317
it means that she would have been notified
that this was gonna happen,

514
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,527
and she would've had
the right to contest to it.

515
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,156
She would have obviously contested it.
They knew that, everyone knew that.

516
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,952
And so they had to do everything
to prevent that from happening.

517
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,079
[horn honks]

518
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,708
[Carr] Sam would later sue Lynne Spears,
Britney's mom,

519
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,337
for defamation based on her account
of his involvement.

520
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,291
[dramatic music playing]

521
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:30,299
Britney went with one
of her dad's appointed security guards…

522
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,136
out to get a hamburger.

523
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,139
As I am told,
they both entered the restaurant,

524
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,266
and Britney sort of did an about-face,

525
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,687
jumped into the car
that he had brought her in and took off.

526
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,359
Uh, she called me
and said that she needed help.

527
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,948
I met her and a friend of hers
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

528
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,117
-[Carr] Adnan Ghalib?
-[Grossman] Correct.

529
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,495
We called Adam.

530
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,875
He was a part of a firm
that I had a relationship with.

531
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,793
[helicopter whirring]

532
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:12,050
We were chased probably by,
I don't know, 50, 75 vehicles.

533
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,553
[paparazzi clamoring]

534
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,138
It is so mean.

535
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,687
[Streisand] We met in my office,
which was crazy,

536
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,524
'cause we had helicopters
swirling over the building.

537
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,902
There must have been a hundred paparazzi.

538
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,613
I sent down my secretary,

539
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,823
who brought a guy from the mailroom

540
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,409
who's like 6'6" and 250 pounds,

541
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,662
to help Britney get up
from the garage to my office.

542
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,747
[Ghalib] Yes.

543
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,334
-[woman] I'm Adam's secretary.
-We gotta go.

544
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,002
[woman] Just follow me.

545
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,088
My secretary, Dolores Gameros,

546
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,674
who's like 5'4",
was elbowing everybody out of the way

547
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,676
and getting her through the crowd

548
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,555
and got her up to the office,
which was just an unbelievable sight.

549
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:05,269
But you can imagine what it is like
for anyone to have to go through that.

550
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,355
[crowd clamoring]

551
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,445
[man] Don't kick me!

552
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:20,368
I can't tell you about what we talked
about, right? Because that's privileged.

553
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,579
But I can tell you what I told the court.

554
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,293
So we walk into court and I said,

555
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,213
"Your Honor, she doesn't want
her father to be the conservator."

556
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,049
"She wants an independent
to be the conservator."

557
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,678
She clearly understood
the concept of a conservatorship.

558
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,721
She understood what was going to happen.

559
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,016
She could make some decisions about it,
and let me say,

560
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,437
I'm not gonna say that in every case,
every conservatorship case,

561
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,233
it's inappropriate to have
a family member as the conservator.

562
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,985
That would be going too far.

563
00:35:54,068 --> 00:36:00,449
But I will say that I generally prefer
to see an independent professional

564
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,784
as the conservator.

565
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:06,622
And the reason is that family
relationships are always complex.

566
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,917
When I told the judge what Britney wanted,

567
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,961
the judge looked at me and said,

568
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:18,259
"Mr. Streisand, I have a report
that says she does not have the capacity

569
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,513
to retain counsel
and have an attorney-client relationship."

570
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,266
"So I'm sorry, Mr. Streisand,

571
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,643
but you're not gonna be able
to represent her

572
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,730
and I need to ask you
to the leave the courtroom." And I did.

573
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,651
[man 1] Can you give us a heads-up
on what happened here today?

574
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,736
No, I'm sorry.

575
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,614
-I've talked to the press.
-[man 2] How's Britney?

576
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,575
There's no law that says that conservatees

577
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,952
have the right
to the attorney of their choice.

578
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,413
It's a hole in the system, for sure,

579
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,750
that allows the courts
to impose their own ideas

580
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,754
of what is the best representation
for the conservatee.

581
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,341
They have what's called
this volunteer panel of lawyers,

582
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,635
which basically means
that the lawyers volunteer.

583
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,930
Doesn't mean they're working for free.
Far from it.

584
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,058
But they volunteer
to get appointed by the court

585
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,684
to represent people like Britney,

586
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,772
people who are conservatees
or proposed conservatees.

587
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:17,568
I can't tell you what happened
in court after I left.

588
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,113
I don't know whether Sam Ingham,

589
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,910
who was appointed as her lawyer,
argued the way that I argued,

590
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,746
that the conservator
shouldn't be Britney's father.

591
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,248
I've got my suspicions.

592
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:36,045
I sure hope Sam Ingham
fought hard against, uh, against it,

593
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,755
but I never heard that he did.

594
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:44,011
[Chicotel] We have very particular
standards for conservatorship.

595
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,722
You have to be unable to meet your needs

596
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,225
for food, clothing, health, and shelter.

597
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,309
So let me put it this way,

598
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,271
I've represented
dozens of conservatees in court,

599
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,439
not one of them has ever had a job.

600
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,527
[ominous music playing]

601
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,529
Somebody called me from People
and they said,

602
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:06,158
"We're gonna write a story
in regards to her father

603
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,744
wanting conservatorship of Britney."

604
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:14,292
They basically, you know,
explained it in one sentence.

605
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,004
"He will be Britney Spears."
That's all they said.

606
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,173
I said, "What do you mean?
Britney Spears is still here."

607
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:27,763
"Nope. She no longer has rights
or say over anything."

608
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,348
"He does."

609
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,601
I'm like,
"Well, why would that be the case?"

610
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,936
"She's functioning."

611
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,399
I watched her write the Blackout album
on a Starbucks napkin

612
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,610
on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City.

613
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,741
I watched her sit there
and put the moves together.

614
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,368
And we're talking about, you know,

615
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,455
what colors to use
and, you know, the scenery,

616
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,875
and the change of scenery,
and the backdrop and costumes.

617
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,878
She did all that, and you're telling me

618
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:03,257
that her father's gonna get
a conservatorship?

619
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,967
It didn't make sense to me.

620
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,178
[journalist] I'm from In Touch magazine.

621
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,139
Let me give you a fucking clue,
I don't talk to no-fucking-body.

622
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,183
[journalist] Why don't you talk to us?

623
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,769
'Cause I never have to talk
to anybody, you dumb fuck.

624
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,289
[suspenseful music playing]

625
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,660
[Carr] The source said,

626
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,455
"This is a confidential report
only a select few have access."

627
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,416
"Most doctors and other professionals

628
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,668
have not been publicly connected
to the case

629
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,378
and would like to remain that way."

630
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:26,924
"The report was produced by a doctor
that resigned from the case in 2013."

631
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,555
Look at this sentence right here.
Read it out loud.

632
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:37,017
[Eliscu] "Britney Spears lacks capacity
to retain and direct counsel."

633
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,398
"Britney Spears lacks the capacity
to understand or manage

634
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:46,861
her own financial affairs
without being subject to undue influence."

635
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,448
What's wild is, at the same time
this report was written,

636
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,199
Britney was back to work.

637
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,660
She was on the set
of How I Met Your Mother.

638
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,329
Sir, please don't yell at me,
because when people yell at me,

639
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,415
I have a tendency to start crying.

640
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:03,461
[Eliscu] The episode was out within two
months of the conservatorship starting.

641
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,713
When they're rude to you,
hang up the phone.

642
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,633
Yet we have paperwork
that says she had dementia.

643
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:15,014
How is someone who is that ill
well enough to go to work?

644
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,231
"Caution should also be exercised

645
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,067
so as not to accelerate her return to work

646
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,987
faster than her emotional recovery allows,

647
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,492
lest she have a relapse that would undo
the progress she has made thus far."

648
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,871
[Carr] The medical team said
that Britney lacked capacity,

649
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,708
but who was the original doctor
that made that decision?

650
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,878
In looking at the publicly available
court documents,

651
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,298
there was only one name
listed in the initial evaluation,

652
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,509
a Dr. J. Edward Spar.

653
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,762
I needed to confirm that he was the doctor

654
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:59,433
that conducted the medical evaluation
that kept the conservatorship in place.

655
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,518
We're ready for slate.

656
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,436
And what the justification was.

657
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,355
[woman] Dr. James, uh…

658
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,856
-Spar.
-[woman] Spar.

659
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,650
Take one, mark.

660
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,734
[man] Thank you.

661
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,279
[Carr] Dr. Spar, tell me about your work.

662
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,533
I am a retired, uh, geriatric psychiatrist

663
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,286
and still do the occasional consultation
for attorneys,

664
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,165
including, you know,
contested conservatorships sometimes.

665
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,918
[Carr] Had you heard of
Britney Spears' music before you met her?

666
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:30,130
You know, uh, I'm not a fan.
I don't listen to music of that ilk.

667
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,174
But, yeah, I know who she is.

668
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,469
-Wait, before I met her?
-Yeah.

669
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,181
Oh, wait, I'm not going to acknowledge
that I've ever met her.

670
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,101
[Carr] Do you specialize in dementia?

671
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,270
Well, I'm a geriatric psychiatrist,

672
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,690
so that's one of the things
that geriatric psychiatrists

673
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,067
spend a lot of time and energy on, yeah.

674
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,571
Is that why you were brought in
to evaluate Britney Spears?

675
00:42:55,114 --> 00:43:00,411
I'm not going to verify that I was ever
brought in to evaluate Britney Spears.

676
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,454
So here is a court document

677
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,249
that said, uh,
"According to Dr. Spar's declaration."

678
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,713
Okay. Again, show me
my signed declaration.

679
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,635
If you show me a public document
with my signature on it,

680
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,013
I will verify my signature.

681
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,850
Other than that, I'm not gonna talk about

682
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:27,187
whether anybody ever retained me
to see anybody, not just Britney Spears.

683
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,440
These are confidential evaluations.

684
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,525
[Carr] But you think, for the most part,

685
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,988
that conservatorships are, um,
mostly to help people?

686
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,617
The ones where I have been involved,

687
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,411
the person who's filing
for the conservatorship

688
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,663
believes that they are acting
in the interests

689
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,665
of their proposed conservatee.

690
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,460
They're trying to protect them
from something.

691
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,129
Usually,
most of the cases I've been involved in,

692
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,173
what they're trying to protect them from

693
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,885
is a predatory individual
after that person's money.

694
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,970
[somber music playing]

695
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,521
[Ghalib]
I get a phone call from her father.

696
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,775
And he's like,
"I need you to come home right now."

697
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,486
I said, "We'll come home
when we come home."

698
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,280
And he said,
"No, you need to bring her home now."

699
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,450
"I'm the conservator of her estate."

700
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,913
You know, he was always so extreme.
You know?

701
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,713
Let me explain to you
how fucking devastating it was

702
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,175
for me to pull up at the gates

703
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,552
and there's her father standing there,

704
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,722
four of the security, and two officers.

705
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,768
And they're standing there,
and she freaks out.

706
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,853
"What are they doing here?
Why are they here?"

707
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,690
"Why is my father at my house? Who are
these people? Why are the cops here?"

708
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,149
And she looks at me.

709
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,112
I'm supposed to be the one
that protects her.

710
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,699
And I'm trying to calm her down. I cannot.

711
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,828
I'm trying to explain to her,
"He is your conservator."

712
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:11,166
"Without his permission,
because he is you, I've kidnapped you."

713
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,502
"And it's that real."

714
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,922
She just looks. She doesn't talk anymore.
She's completely silent.

715
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,178
You know, they escort her into the house.

716
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,266
That's when the realization was,

717
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,227
"Okay, I don't think
things are gonna be the same."

718
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,660
[camera shutter clicking]

719
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,457
[Carr] As 2008 continued,
Britney had reportedly negotiated

720
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,168
50-50 custody of her kids.

721
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,587
The amount of time she spent with them

722
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,299
was subject to the approval
of her dad and conservator, Jamie.

723
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,302
[indistinct chatter]

724
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,182
Britney seemed to be recovering
from the events

725
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,476
that led to her hospitalization.

726
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,562
It was deemed by Britney, Inc.
that it was time to work,

727
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,855
and work she did.

728
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,733
[indistinct chatter]

729
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,071
It started with recording a new album,

730
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,700
and then the idea
of a tell-all documentary was proposed.

731
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,536
This MTV Film would be called
For the Record.

732
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,956
This was a new time
in Britney's professional life,

733
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,126
and it meant those that worked with her
would be carefully selected

734
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,753
by the conservatorship.

735
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,674
It was interesting going through
a lot of this with other creatives

736
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,135
and people who were sort of
from the outside.

737
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,262
I remember at one point talking amongst us

738
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,599
and realizing that, like,
there wasn't a single person

739
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,893
that was involved with that project

740
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,481
that didn't come out
feeling affected emotionally.

741
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,566
Like, not a single person.

742
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,694
[Britney] If I wasn't under the restraints
that I'm under right now,

743
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:08,075
with all the lawyers and doctors
and people analyzing me every day

744
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,576
and all that kind of stuff,

745
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,833
like, if that wasn't there, I'd feel
so liberated and feel like myself.

746
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,127
It's like… It's bad.

747
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,213
[somber music playing]

748
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,346
I'm sad.

749
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,309
[Jamie] The best thing for her is
what she's doing right now.

750
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,646
Let's give her…
She's in her element. She's in her world.

751
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:42,651
And, uh, keeping her busy.
You know, like me, I like to go fishing.

752
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,487
She likes to sing and dance.
She likes to work.

753
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,573
Are they gonna bring
something here or something?

754
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:51,118
-I have no idea what's going on.
-Yes, you do, brat.

755
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,872
-Does everybody know what we're doing?
-[man] Yep.

756
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,456
-Except me.
-[man] Except you.

757
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,666
Is that my car?

758
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,920
[Gallery] I was there that day,
and I remember,

759
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:06,967
like with almost everything, there were
these two polar opposite feelings.

760
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,262
Like, it was so nice for her
to get to drive her car

761
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,682
with the top down
and just feel free for a minute.

762
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,853
But on the other hand, I'm thinking,
like, what is going on with this girl

763
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,397
that we have to arrange…

764
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,066
Thirty people have
to arrange this whole thing

765
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,738
to let her drive her car
to feel free for 30 minutes?

766
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,657
Like, in what context?

767
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:36,496
Like… Like, how is that
how she gets to feel free?

768
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,250
The whole thing is fucked up. I'm sorry.

769
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,713
[crowd cheering]

770
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,342
Britney and I had become close.

771
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:53,138
I could shoot her in a way that not
all the other camera people could.

772
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:57,184
Um, and so then we just developed
this sort of close-knit friendship.

773
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,939
There were times she'd ask me for help,

774
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,983
whether it was questions
about legal issues

775
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:09,237
or, you know,
stuff about conservatorships.

776
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,658
Um, and I would usually try
and deflect these things

777
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,826
because if I didn't have an answer,

778
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,496
I didn't want to give her
any wrong information.

779
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,708
Um, but I know that there were times
that she did want to speak out

780
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,586
and address things
and wasn't really able to.

781
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,342
This People article came out.

782
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:34,221
I think they had interviewed Kevin
and obviously talked about Britney.

783
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,516
And there was stuff
she didn't really agree with.

784
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,477
And it's like she wanted to respond to it.

785
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,564
And so, yeah, she wrote this letter
and she gave it to me

786
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,110
and she was like,
"Can you read this on TV?"

787
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,824
"What happened to Britney was a year ago
and people need to get with the times."

788
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,618
"And as for Kevin
saying Britney divorced him,

789
00:49:56,702 --> 00:50:00,080
she was forced to by her lawyers
because she went to visit him in New York,

790
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,957
and he wouldn't see her and the children."

791
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,919
"And her lawyer said if she doesn't
divorce him, he's gonna do it himself."

792
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,715
"So, Kevin trying to play
the innocent victim is hardly irrelevant."

793
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,717
"He left her and the babies."

794
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,219
"Her going on the mend,
partying two years ago,

795
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,847
has nothing to do with the situation now."

796
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:21,059
"She's a different person, and most
of their fighting was done back then

797
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:25,772
because of his problem waking and baking
to marijuana at 5:00 in the morning."

798
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,943
"No one talks about these things
because no one knows the truth."

799
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,279
"She was lied to and set up."

800
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,699
"Her children were taken away
and she did spin out of control,

801
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,452
which any mother would
in those circumstances."

802
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:44,124
"This year, Britney's been silenced to
speak out about anything that's going on."

803
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:48,295
"The people controlling her life
have made $3 million this year."

804
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,214
"She would love for new eyes
to see her situation,

805
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,633
but if she brings it up,
she's constantly threatened

806
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,470
that the conservators
will take her kids away."

807
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,555
"So how long does this go on for?"

808
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,225
"As long as the people are getting paid
and she has no rights,

809
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:06,021
it could go on for a while,
but it doesn't make it right at all."

810
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:11,276
"Britney's given her brother
a $2 million apartment,

811
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,236
her mother an estate in Louisiana,

812
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,031
and her father
the best job in show business."

813
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:20,911
"She's a very giving person and would love
to get the respect she deserves."

814
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,875
It was an emotional response
to the article coming out,

815
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,711
and it is like her first response.

816
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,380
For me not to read it all on TV
right away was also saying,

817
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,093
why don't you just take a couple days
and cool down from this?

818
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,554
And then a couple days later,
maybe we can revisit it.

819
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,391
Things like this would happen often,
not necessarily like this letter,

820
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,937
but like trying to use my phone
to call people.

821
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,649
Those are the things you had
to look out for and steer her away from.

822
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:54,945
And then, a couple days later,
I got a phone call from the lawyers.

823
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:59,491
The letter had some, you know,
some information that would be really bad

824
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,993
if it came out or something like that.

825
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:06,081
And so, all of a sudden, the letter turned
into a much bigger thing.

826
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:11,128
And then, you know, I just brought it in
and showed it to them, and that was that.

827
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,297
[Carr] But you had enough foresight
to copy the letter?

828
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,424
I wouldn't call it foresight.

829
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:20,345
I think that when she gave it to me,
we took a picture of it

830
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,890
because I didn't want
to actually carry the letter.

831
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,268
And what was that experience like for you?

832
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,022
I mean, again, like,
I always just felt bad for her.

833
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,154
I felt bad that, like,
this was her reality and her world,

834
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,032
where she gave me a letter,
and then, all of a sudden,

835
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,702
this huge fire alarm goes off.

836
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:50,917
It's crazy. All she wanted to do
was respond to an article.

837
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,087
[Carr] How much longer did you work
with Britney after that?

838
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:59,968
It was pretty shortly after that
that I stopped working with her.

839
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:05,849
I think at that point it was obvious that
we were close and pretty good friends.

840
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,017
Um…

841
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,605
I mean, this was coming after I was
her date for her brother's wedding.

842
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:16,735
And, you know, we had developed,
you know, I think just like a good trust.

843
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,530
And maybe we were too close at that point.

844
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,242
And so, yeah,
shortly after that, I got removed.

845
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:31,666
I actually… I don't think
I've spoken to her since.

846
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,591
And Britney had met a bunch of my friends.

847
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:44,721
You know? She had, you know,
like sort of come into my life.

848
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:50,435
And, you know, it was just sad to think
that she was gonna be alone again.

849
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,109
[pensive music playing]

850
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,565
[Eliscu] In January of 2009,
I went to L.A. for the winter,

851
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,318
and I had made contact with Sam Lutfi.

852
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,990
He'd been a good background source
for the Rolling Stone cover story,

853
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,867
and we had kept in touch
even after it came out.

854
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,705
Then he told me about the fact
that he and Adnan had been trying

855
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:55,959
to come up with a plan
to help her find a different lawyer.

856
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:01,631
She still, in January of 2009,

857
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:06,052
still wanted a different lawyer
if she could get one.

858
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,556
This was a full year
of the conservatorship

859
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,766
supposedly having saved her life.

860
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,061
They had been talking to different lawyers

861
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:19,107
who thought that if they could get her
to sign this document

862
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,570
saying why she wanted a new lawyer
and why she wanted the specific lawyer

863
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,740
that that would be something
that would just have to happen then

864
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,868
and there would be no way to refute it.

865
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,456
At that time, Sam and Adnan
were persona non grata.

866
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:38,335
They had been completely forbidden
from having access to Britney.

867
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,463
And within days of me arriving in L.A.,

868
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,883
Sam started talking about trying
to get her to sign this thing

869
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,344
and trying to find someone
who might get her to sign.

870
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:54,059
I can't say there was a specific moment
that convinced me to do it.

871
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,521
Of course, I was concerned about being
a participant in the story

872
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,316
I was trying to cover objectively.

873
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:06,279
But, at that point, I had known
Britney Spears for a decade almost,

874
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:12,660
so I cared about her in a human way that
there was no denying it at that point,

875
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:17,082
that I could be more useful
as a Good Samaritan almost

876
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:21,211
than another journalist trying
to cover the story.

877
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,963
[man] Anything to say
about the conservatorship today?

878
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:28,968
[Eliscu] Sam explained to me
that I would need to go to the Montage

879
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,930
and she would be waiting for me.

880
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,225
And she would know
to come meet me in the bathroom.

881
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,771
I just walked in thinking,
"Pretend I'm a guest."

882
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:45,110
I took the elevator up and I walked out
and I saw Edon, her security guard,

883
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,613
up there and maybe one other,
like, security-looking dude.

884
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:53,952
She was just in the pool by herself.
Just leaning on the edge of the pool.

885
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:58,123
Um, and I kind of gave her
a little side-eye and saw her see me,

886
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:01,084
and then went into this small bathroom.

887
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:05,630
I went into the stall, closed the door,
and got the papers and the pen ready,

888
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:09,217
and saw her tattoo
on her foot or ankle or whatever it is,

889
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:15,140
and opened the door and I showed her
the spots where she needed to sign.

890
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,393
And she signed and looked at me
and said, "Thank you."

891
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,686
And I said…

892
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:33,533
I said, "I'll see you again. Go."

893
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:41,040
Yeah, she definitely seemed scared.
It was hard to tell 'cause I was scared.

894
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,963
But she was appreciative, which was,
like, such classic kind of her vibe to be,

895
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:50,133
in that moment to be scared
but to also be grateful, you know?

896
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,218
[eerie music playing]

897
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,512
I thought the documents were
gonna be delivered right away.

898
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:39,432
I was told there would be
an ex parte hearing to address this,

899
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,808
but then days passed

900
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:45,438
and Britney was supposed
to go on a trip somewhere with her dad.

901
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,775
And we thought that when he sees
that she signed it,

902
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,236
he'll know that things are gonna change.

903
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,615
I couldn't believe it when I found out,
about a week later,

904
00:58:55,698 --> 00:59:01,579
that it was all over and that, similar to
what had happened with Adam Streisand,

905
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,331
that it had been ruled

906
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:07,252
that she lacked
the capacity to choose a lawyer

907
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,881
and that they had cast enough doubt
on to whether that was her signature.

908
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,052
I never heard anything of it again.

909
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,930
No one ever talked about it again,

910
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:23,351
and still no one really talks
about the fact

911
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:27,564
that there was another attempt
to get a lawyer

912
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,399
that somehow didn't work out.

913
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:35,113
[Carr] But someone else knew
about the incident at the Montage.

914
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:39,993
Seven days after Britney signed the papers
saying she wanted new representation,

915
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,413
the court-appointed lawyer
for the conservatorship, Sam Ingham,

916
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,791
stated that Britney told him
she'd met with a reporter

917
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:51,296
from Rolling Stone to sign documents
about acquiring new counsel.

918
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,926
He went on to say,
"Britney does not wish to do that,"

919
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,055
and asked him to do whatever is necessary
to "squash the document."

920
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,099
She further stated that she was,

921
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,728
"Fully satisfied
with my representation of her."

922
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:13,067
That same day, the attorney she had tried
to hire, John Anderson, withdrew, stating,

923
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:17,780
"I can say no more; will do no more."
And, "That is the end for me."

924
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,745
It was another time that Britney had tried
to seek her own representation

925
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,496
and it failed.

926
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:32,211
[Chicotel] It's the conservatee's attorney
is the one person in this system

927
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:36,549
who is tasked with making
the conservatee's best case

928
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,718
for whatever the conservatee wants.

929
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,804
I've seen so many instances
where those attorneys

930
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,057
are not representing
what their clients want.

931
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:50,563
[Streisand] Keep in mind that the only way
that Sam Ingham gets paid

932
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,359
is he has to file a petition
with the court,

933
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,278
and then the conservator have
the right to object

934
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,323
to him getting paid
or the fees he's asking for.

935
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:04,118
Obviously, there is
a natural tendency to say,

936
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:08,081
"Well, I certainly don't want
to be pissing off the people

937
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,793
who are gonna have the ability
to object to me getting paid."

938
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,172
[Carr] What is your reaction to knowing
that a court-appointed attorney

939
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:20,843
is making over 3 million dollars,
like as-- In this position?

940
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:25,973
My reaction is that he's on a gravy train
and he'll ride it all the way to the end.

941
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,896
[man] Are you concerned
for Britney's mental health?

942
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,147
[Carr] By early 2009,

943
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:37,026
Jamie Spears asked that the temporary
conservatorship of his daughter

944
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,403
be made permanent.

945
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,573
And there was a range
of new specific powers and privileges

946
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,826
that would be given
to the conservatorship,

947
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,665
spanning from using funds from the estate
to pay for a car for Jamie…

948
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:56,421
to giving him more complete control
over Britney's personal finances.

949
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,552
Perhaps most importantly, though,
the permanent conservatorship

950
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:07,765
would allow Jamie to pursue professional
opportunities available to Britney

951
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,518
once they're approved by her medical team.

952
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,442
-["Circus" playing over speakers]
-[scatting]

953
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,411
Britney was preparing for a huge tour,

954
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,998
whatever concerns
the conservatorship's medical team had

955
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,710
about her health and overworking
seemed to be forgotten.

956
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,759
[Eliscu] First off, ticket sales
are going phenomenally well.

957
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:47,013
Sales have generated about 40 million.

958
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,684
Second, there seems
to be an opportunity to add two shows

959
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,772
at the end of the U.S. leg
on very attractive financial terms.

960
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,691
So this is before the Circus tour.

961
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,780
They don't even know yet
if she's gonna be, like, okay to tour,

962
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,615
-but they're adding more dates.
-Right.

963
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:09,577
They went from temporary conservatorship
to permanent conservatorship,

964
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,996
and Circus was that year.

965
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,043
So us noting that there was
financial incentives for Larry, for Jamie,

966
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:22,048
for the lawyers to get her working,
A, but get her working more.

967
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,383
[audience cheering]

968
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:29,138
[Carr] The Circus tour was performed
over the course of nine months

969
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,141
and totaled 70 shows spanning the world.

970
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,521
[Eliscu] I've had people tell me
that there were conversations explicitly 

971
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,315
about how quickly she could come back.

972
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,943
They probably felt like it was important

973
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:45,947
to show her looking healthy and okay
as quickly as possible

974
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,909
to prove that what they decided to do
was the right decision.

975
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,160
[man] Britney!

976
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,370
Britney!

977
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,082
[Gallery] There's nothing relaxing
about being on a tour.

978
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,836
Flying all over the world,

979
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,672
being in different countries
every few days.

980
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,924
[reporter] Are you sick
of your dad being conservator?

981
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:09,303
[Gallery] I can only imagine how stressful
and challenging that might be for her.

982
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,144
Was she in the right mental state
to put all that time and energy

983
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:22,316
into doing a whole--? Revamping her
entire career and doing this comeback?

984
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,737
It's like, that's hard.

985
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,994
We've had, on background, conversations
with people who were on the tour.

986
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:37,582
They said it was a mess.
They said it was bad for Britney's health.

987
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:38,833
[audience cheering]

988
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,794
[Carr] The conservatorship stated

"Her main focus,
almost to the point of obsession,

was getting more time with her children."

992

"Her second preoccupation was
whether the conservatorship would end

993

and whether her father Jamie Spears would
be more lenient with her privileges."

Oh, man. She gets an allowance,
she's got "privileges,"

"Britney began to complain
about Jamie's drinking."

about the conservatorship itself."

1051
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:13,339
"In a simple way, she feels that
if she is drug tested, so should he be."

"If she were to suffer a great penalty,
like losing her kids,

"She indicates she would go along
with the conservatorship of the estate,

The conservatorship has maintained
Britney has never once asked for it

she would tell people about it.

1064
01:08:54,713 --> 01:09:00,052
But we have here in evidence that
she wanted out of the conservatorship,

1065
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,097
that she was vocalizing that need,
and that it was ignored.

The medical team thought that X Factor
put undue pressure on Britney,

that withdrawing would be just as bad

the medical team cautiously
approved Britney's participation,

presence was, quote, "mandatory."

1151
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:03,313
He goes, "I don't know
what you just did to her

1152
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:07,151
and what your relationship was like,
but can you come back more?"

1153
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:11,071
"In the nine years I've worked for her,
I've never seen her smile like that."

1154
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,368
There aren't a lot of people in her life
that are from those days.

1155
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,246
It's myself, Felicia
and a couple other people.

1156
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:26,545
I got called back to do Circus Tour,
Femme Fatale,

1157
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,672
and then the four years in Vegas.

1158
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:31,341
I had much less contact with her.

1159
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,720
But I made sure, every show,
she knew I was there.

1160
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,431
[Carr] And then did she continue
to love performing?

1161
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,475
I mean, it's such an intense schedule.

1162
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,269
What was her relationship like
with performing?

1163
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,857
Britney loved performing.

1164
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:50,652
Hands down,
still to this second, loves performing.

1165
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,821
Um…

1166
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,492
I think that's probably as much
as I can say about that.

1167
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:57,993
[softly] Sorry.

1168
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:01,914
I don't want to fight with them.
It's not worth it to me.

1169
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,582
I'm sorry.

1170
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,419
[ominous music playing]

1171
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:11,882
[Carr] The one thing we know for sure
is that Britney worked almost nonstop

1172
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,676
and made other people a lot of money.

1173
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:04,101
[announcer] All right, everyone. We are
here to welcome the new queen of Vegas!

1174
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:08,981
[Carr] In January 2019, Britney announced
a new Vegas residency.

1175
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,275
It would be called Domination.

1176
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,151
[audience cheering]

1177
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,073
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, Britney Spears!

1178
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,576
[Carr]
When she walked down the red carpet,

1179
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:23,620
it felt like she was almost
about to say something.

1180
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:24,997
But then she didn't.

1181
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,960
Three months later, via Instagram,

1182
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:34,172
Britney would cancel the show,
citing family health concerns.

1183
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,134
And the world was watching.

1184
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,932
That was a huge moment when
the fan community began to suspect

1185
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,978
that something weird was going on in 2019.

1186
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:52,899
There was even, like, missing posters
being shared around social media.

1187
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:56,028
Kind of as a joke, but also like
we literally haven't seen her

1188
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,071
in, like, weeks, if not months.

1189
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,949
And cut to April 2019,

1190
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:06,330
we find out that Britney was placed into
a mental health facility against her will.

1191
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:11,043
That's what is believed, and she was being
given medication she did not wanna take.

1192
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:16,506
I know that there are a lot of voices

1193
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:19,343
I've heard from many different quarters

1194
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:24,598
that Britney is being held as a prisoner,
in effect, against her will.

1195
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:29,311
And when I've been asked
do I think that's accurate,

1196
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:33,774
I think you have to say to yourself

1197
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:39,988
it's not as if Los Angeles is
some type of fascist gulag,

1198
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:43,283
where, in order to get a message
to the outside world,

1199
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:47,537
you have to write it down
on a piece of birch bark and in code,

1200
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:51,958
then throw it over an electrified fence
to an unsuspecting gardener.

1201
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,879
If she wanted to get a message out
as far as being held against her will,

1202
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:59,675
I can't even imagine
the numbers of ways she can do that.

1203
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:04,971
[Carr] Eventually, Britney resurfaced
via an Instagram video.

1204
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:09,893
Hi, guys. Just checking in with all of you
who are concerned. All is well.

1205
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:13,021
My family has been going through
a lot of stress and anxiety lately,

1206
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:17,192
so I just needed time to deal.
Don't worry, I'll be back very soon.

1207
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,862
[Carr] The video only increased
public speculation.

1208
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,199
What was going on
inside the conservatorship,

1209
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:27,494
and why was she in one
if she was, quote, "okay"?

1210
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,881
[Eliscu] We know that in summer of 2019,

1211
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:44,511
after there was already beginning to be
some chaos in the conservatorship

1212
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:48,390
for the first time in more than a decade,
that there was an incident

1213
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:52,728
where a confrontation occurred
between Jamie and one of Britney's sons.

1214
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:56,440
And Kevin Federline, you know,
his father and Britney's ex,

1215
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,483
had a restraining order filed
against Jamie,

1216
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,738
such that he's not allowed
to be in the presence of the children

1217
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,699
for a specified period of years.

1218
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:08,827
[Carr] What's been in public record
is there was an altercation,

1219
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,539
a door was broken down,
one of her sons was shaken.

1220
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:19,296
Um, the restraining order was based
on an unauthorized--

1221
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:23,550
Uh, let's just say
it had to do with conduct

1222
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:26,720
that put the children
in fear of their safety.

1223
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,638
How did a door get broken?

1224
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:30,140
Um…

1225
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,311
I think a door was slammed in some regard,

1226
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:38,774
and, uh, it caused the door to come off
the hinge or something in that regard.

1227
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,443
[ominous music playing]

1228
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,743
[Carr] At the end of 2019,

1229
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:53,038
Lou Taylor resurfaced in court documents.

1230
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:56,583
She had e-mailed Jamie,
saying her company, Tri Star,

1231
01:19:56,666 --> 01:20:01,129
had lost $400,000 in billing in 2019

1232
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,799
for work as Britney's business manager.

1233
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:07,761
She requested a minimum of $500,000.

1234
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:12,724
Yet it was a time
when Britney wasn't working.

1235
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,312
When Jamie was sent a bill
the month later,

1236
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:19,231
he paid the funds the next day.

1237
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:27,656
This is what Jamie Spears, in July 2020,

1238
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:30,408
said of Britney Spears,

1239
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,994
of the conservatorship
and the need for it.

1240
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,497
Why don't we do here?

1241
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,293
"James P. Spears respectfully submits
this status update

1242
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:44,381
to provide information in advance of
and regarding some of the topics

1243
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:46,508
that were addressed at the last hearing."

1244
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:51,972
"The conservatee, Britney, has refused
to engage in any business activities,

1245
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:56,017
including making a non-performing
appearance at a local pop-up store

1246
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,312
dedicated to the conservatee,
where minimal effort was required,

1247
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:03,191
resulting in the estate being required
to refund the advance it had received

1248
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,569
in the amount of $1 million."

1249
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,612
[Carr] "The conservatee's lack
of cooperation

1250
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,155
in her own financial well-being

1251
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:12,701
and preservation of her continued stature
as an iconic artist

1252
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:15,036
has deteriorated rather than improved."

1253
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,080
"As a result
of the conservatee's trajectory,

1254
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:19,666
Mr. Spears has been working
to establish a model

1255
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:22,878
where Ms. Spear's
current lifestyle can be preserved

1256
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:26,548
and her needs met
based solely on passive income."

1257
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:28,592
"Given the state of the economy

1258
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:31,094
and this enormous cost
of maintaining her lifestyle,

1259
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:32,929
this is a tall order."

Her lifestyle,
which includes all these legal bills.

1261
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:45,483
All of these interviews
and all of these hours talking to her

1262
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:49,696
and describing her
and criticizing her and limiting her,

1263
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:53,950
and none of this led to anything.

1264
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:55,535
It just all stayed the same.

1265
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:59,998
They could go into court a million times,
keep doing hearing after hearing,

1266
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,918
filing after filing,
and analysis after analysis,

1267
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:06,922
and never change anything,
and she's still in this situation.

1268

-How do you get out?
-I just--

1269
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,928
You don't get out until you scream.

[emotional music playing]

1271
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,866
[Carr] If you were able to speak to her,
what would you tell her?

1272
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,076
What would you say?

1273
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,370
[Gallery] I feel like,
maybe I'd apologize.

1274
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:40,956
I feel like I didn't, you know, do enough,

1275
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,042
and maybe I would just… let her know

1276
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,545
that I felt bad about
not being able to help more.

1277
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:52,217
I don't understand how the legal system
has let this go on for so long.

1278
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,972
Maybe it's like the first one of its kind
and they don't know how to handle it,

1279
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:59,683
but it seems like it's an epic fail
of the legal system

1280
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:02,018
that this has gone on for so long

1281
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,813
and that there's been no resolution even.

1282
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:06,731
It just seems like it keeps getting worse.

1283
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:16,366
It feels like something's gonna happen.
Definitely, something's gonna happen.

At stake is control
of the 39-year-old singer's career

Going through introductions-

1301
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,555
[Britney] I have a lot to say,
so bear with me.

1302
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:26,895
I don't think I was heard on any level
when I came to court the last time.

1303
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:31,107
I brought four sheets of paper in my hand
and wrote in length

1304
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:34,152
what I had been through
the last four months before I came there.

1305
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:38,323
The people who did that to me
should not be able to walk away so easily.

1306
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:39,449
I'll recap.

1307
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:43,119
I was on tour.
My management said if I don't do this,

1308
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,413
I will have to find an attorney,
and by contract,

1309
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:49,542
my own management could sue me
if I didn't follow through with the tour.

1310
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,169
It was very threatening and scary,

and with the conservatorship,
I couldn't even get my own attorney.

1312
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:57,133
So, out of fear,
I went ahead and I did the tour.

1313
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:01,679
When I came off that tour, a new show
in Las Vegas was supposed to take place.

1314
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,140
I started rehearsing early,
but it was hard

1315
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:08,186
'cause I'd been doing Vegas for four years
and I needed a break in between.

1316
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:11,940
But, no, I was told, "This is the timeline
and this is how it's gonna go."

1317
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:15,401
I was basically directing
most of the show.

1318
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:18,947
I taught my dancers
my new choreography myself.

1319
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,866
I wasn't good. I was great.

1320
01:25:22,742 --> 01:25:24,744
[dramatic music playing]

1321
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:32,168
They said, if I don't want to do
the new Vegas show, I don't have to.

1322
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:35,296
It was like lifting,
literally, 200 pounds off of me.

1323
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:40,301
He immediately, the next day,
put me on lithium out of nowhere.

1324
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,971
He took me off my normal meds
I'd been on for five years.

1325
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:46,432
And lithium is a very, very strong
and completely different medication

1326
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:47,976
compared to what I was used to.

1327
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:51,062
Not only did my family not do
a goddamn thing,

1328
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,605
my dad was all for it.

1329
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:55,608
He loved every minute of it.

1330
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:58,945
The control he had over someone
as powerful as me…

1331
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:03,783
100,000% he loved it.

1332
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,038
That's why I'm telling you this again,
two years later,

1333
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:12,500
after I've lied and told the whole world
I'm okay and happy,

1334
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:13,585
it's a lie.

1335
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:17,172
I thought maybe I said that enough,
maybe I might become happy

1336
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,966
because I've been in denial,
I've been in shock.

1337
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:21,676
I am traumatized.

1338
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,179
But now I'm telling you the truth.

1339
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:25,972
I'm not happy. I can't sleep.

1340
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:29,976
I'm so angry, it's insane.
And I'm depressed. I cry every day.

1341
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:32,228
The reason I'm telling you this is
because I don't think

1342
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,565
how the state of California can have
all this written in the court documents

1343
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:37,984
from the time I showed up
and do absolutely nothing.

1344
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:42,113
Ma'am, my dad and anyone involved
in this conservatorship should be in jail.

1345
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:46,034
The last time I spoke to you,
it made me feel like I was dead,

1346
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:47,452
like I didn't matter.

1347
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,788
I'm telling you this again,
so maybe you can understand the depth

1348
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:54,584
and the degree and the damage
that they did to me back then.

1349
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:58,087
It's embarrassing and demoralizing
what I've been through,

1350
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,882
and that's the main reason
I've never said it openly.

1351
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:02,550
And I didn't want to say it openly

1352
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:05,428
'cause I honestly didn't think
anyone would believe me.

1353
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,933
I just want my life back.
It's been 13 years and it's enough.

1354
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:13,061
It makes no sense whatsoever
for the state of California to sit back

1355
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:16,564
and literally watch me make a living
for so many people

1356
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:19,108
and be told I'm not good enough.

1357
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:21,819
But I'm great at what I do.

1358
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:37,126
[audience chanting]
Britney, Britney, Britney!

1359
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,672
[Britney]
I feel ganged up on, and I feel bullied,

1360
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,424
and I feel left out and alone.

1361
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,760
And I'm tired of feeling alone.

1362
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:48,680
I deserve to have the same rights
as anybody does

1363
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:52,475
by having a child,
a family, any of those things.

1364
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:55,186
That's all I wanted to say to you,

1365
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,147
and thank you so much
for letting me speak to you today.

1366
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:09,200
[pensive music playing]

1367
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,632
[pensive music continues]
