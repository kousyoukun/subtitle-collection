00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,166
你们的G98步枪最好干干净净的
And you'd better do it with a clean G98.

150
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,366
你们要细心呵护它
You'll pamper it.

151
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,100
好好爱它
You'll love it.

152
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:07,466
它要像他妈的圣母的大腿一样干净
And damn it, you'll keep it as spotless as the Holy Virgin's thighs.

153
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,133
明白了吗
-Do we understand each other?

154
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,766
遵命
-Yes, sir!

155
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:13,633
欢迎加入第78步兵预备团
Welcome to the 78th Infantry Reserve Regiment.

156
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,033
我们现在在西线
We're on the Western Front now.

157
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,600
欢迎来到巴黎
Welcome to Paris!

158
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,666
太好了
Yes!

159
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,533
妈的 怎么回事
Damn it, what happened?

160
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,366
我有命令要在傍晚6点前把连队送到
I have to deliver the company to the front by 6 p.m.

161
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,866
可以 但您得步行
You can, but on foot.

162
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:59,566
我们需要这辆卡车 中尉
We need the trucks, Lieutenant.

163
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,233
恕我直言 我的命令…
-With all due respect, my orders…

164
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:03,033
我他妈去你的命令
-You can stick your orders up your arse!

165
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,566
我有40个人在泥里奄奄一息
I've got 40 men here dying in the mud.

166
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,866
马上给我下车
Get out right now!

167
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,966
所有人都下车
Everyone out!

168
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,266
快点 赶紧的
Come on. Make it snappy.

169
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:17,166
你们听到军医说的了
You heard the staff surgeon.

170
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,233
快点 士兵们 别在这儿睡着了
Faster, soldiers! Don't fall asleep here!

171
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:26,666
快点
Come on!

172
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:33,966
弗朗茨穆勒 是吗
-Franz Müller, right?

173
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:34,866
对
-Yes.

174
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,500
总指挥官指望你能至少活六个礼拜
The commander-in-chief expects you to survive at least six weeks.

175
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,566
你想六周后还活着吗
-Do you want to be alive in six weeks?

176
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,466
想 中尉
-Yes, sir.

177
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:44,599
那就快走 别给我拖拖拉拉的
Then stop dragging your feet and get a move on!

178
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:46,299
听见没有
-Did you hear me?

179
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,233
是
-Yes.

180
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,233
快点
Hurry up!

181
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,500
这不是休闲茶会
We're not at a tea dance!

182
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,833
毒气
Gas!

183
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,466
-毒气  -毒气
-Gas! -Gas!

184
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,633
毒气
Gas!

185
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,933
毒气
Gas!

186
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,799
快戴上防毒面具
Gas masks on!

187
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,966
各位
That, gentlemen,

188
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,833
刚才那个是个大炮弹
was a fat pig.

189
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,133
如果法国人再瞄准一点的话
If the French could aim better,

190
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,666
他们就可以拿勺子把我们从路边挖走
they'd be scraping us off the road now with a spoon

191
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,699
把我们埋进铁饭盒里了
and burying us in a mess tin.

192
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,366
但有一件事是毋庸置疑的
But one thing is as sure as eggs is eggs.

193
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:26,366
大炮弹是没有毒气的
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

194
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,933
向前看
Eyes front!

195
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,266
你是听不见吗
-Have you got cloth ears?

196
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:45,633
不是 中尉
-No, sir.

197
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,399
我只是忙着戴上防毒面具
I was just trying to put on my mask.

198
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,733
你 保罗博伊默尔 基本上活不过天亮
You, Paul B?umer, will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

199
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:01,966
你他妈的去吃点东西吧
You should eat something, damn it.

200
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,166
听我口令 摘下防毒面具
Attention! Gas masks off!

201
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,300
摘下防毒面具
Gas masks off!

202
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,233
你别摘
Not you.

203
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,833
你戴到今晚值班放哨为止
You keep yours on until guard duty tonight.

204
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,466
和那个笨蛋一起
With that bonehead there.

205
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,833
列队
Line up!

206
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:17,833
行进
March!

207
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,266
大家跟紧点 快走
Stick together and get moving!

208
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,433
抓紧时间 快点
Come on, hurry up!

209
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:42,999
保罗
Paul! Paul,

210
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,966
来 把你的背包给我
come on. Give me your backpack.

211
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,766
下次你可以帮我背
You can carry mine next time.

212
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,199
恭喜你们 士兵们
Congratulations, soldiers.

213
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,200
这是你们的新家
This is your new?home.

214
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,200
摘掉头盔
Helmets off!

215
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,333
看来我不在时这里很热闹 斯坦伯格
I see the men have been enjoying my absence, Steinberger.

216
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,233
我们整晚都被炮火轰炸
There was gunfire all night.

217
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,533
大家都要崩溃了
Their nerves are shot.

218
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,466
干燥的靴子会是一剂良药
Dry boots are a good remedy for that.

219
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,799
你想让我们都淹死吗
Do you want us all to?drown?

220
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,433
大家都出把力 把战壕里的水舀出去
Everyone pitches in! Bail out the trench.

221
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:25,966
你还在等什么 博伊默尔
What are you waiting for, B?umer?

222
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,566
还杵在那儿干什么
Why are you still standing around?

223
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,033
不用站岗的士兵快点舀水

224
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,899
给狗扔一块肉
Throw a dog a bone,

225
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,733
肯定会被叼走
it will always snap it up.

226
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,066
给人一点权力的话
Give a man power…

227
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
他会变得野蛮
Man is a beast.

228
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,700
喝吧
Drink.

229
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,133
凯特因斯基 过来 帮忙舀水
Katczinsky, come over here. Lend a hand.

230
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,933
我们今晚会遭到猛攻
We'll get hit hard tonight.

231
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,033
对不起
Sorry.

232
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,066
别说了
Forget about it.

233
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,033
这跟我想象中的不一样
This isn't how I imagined it.

234
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,499
闭嘴 路德维希
Shut up, Ludwig.

235
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,333
我的手 我的手没知觉了
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

236
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,699
把手伸进内裤里
Stick them down your trousers.

237
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,366
我就是这样做的
That's what I always do.

238
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,533
你觉得这样会有利于射击吗
You think that will make it shoot better?

239
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:49,866
你听到了吗
-Did you hear that?

240
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,800
什么
-What?

241
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:53,299
那个声音 你听
That sound. Listen.

242
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,866
什么都没有
There's nothing there.

243
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:06,933
我们的第一个法国人
Our first Frenchmen.

244
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,666
冷静点 小保罗
Calm down, Paulie.

245
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,633
我也听到了
I hear it now too.

246
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,533
是谁
Who's there?

247
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:30,166
嘿
Hey.

248
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:33,666
现身吧
Show yourself!

249
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,300
不好
No!

250
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,433
我中枪了
I got hit!

251
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,299
不 保罗 不要啊
-No, Paul. No.

252
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,433
怎么回事
-What's going on there?

253
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:00,533
不好了
Oh, no.

254
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:08,933
怎么回事
What is it?

255
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,366
那边的人朝我开枪
They shot at me from over there.

256
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,800
他们看到你的枪口闪光了
They saw your muzzle flash.

257
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,633
低调一点
Keep your heads down.

258
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:26,266
不想接住下一颗子弹 就往左挪10米
Unless you want to catch the next bullet with your teeth, move ten metres.

259
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:29,099
开枪 移动 再开枪 再移动 懂了吗
Shoot, then move. Shoot, then move. Understood?

260
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:31,666
懂了
Yes.

261
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,133
来
Come on.

262
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,933
快找掩护
Take cover!

263
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,066
进来
In here!

264
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,300
博伊默尔 克罗普 你俩快进来 快
B?umer, Kropp! You two, in here. Quick!

265
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
快进地堡
In the bunker!

266
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
快进去
Get in!

267
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,433
“吃东西小心点”
"Watch what you eat."

268
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,066
我母亲是这么叮嘱我的
That's what my mother said.

269
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:22,433
我们不离不弃 对吧
-We'll stick together, Paul.

270
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,799
-对  -不离不弃
-Yeah. -We'll stick together.

271
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,766
对
-Yeah.

272
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,400
我做不到 保罗
I can't do this, Paul.

273
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,566
我做不到 我想回家
I can't do this. I want to go home.

274
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,299
-嘘 -我想回家
I want to go home.

275
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,766
这是徐进弹幕
Creeping barrage.

276
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:58,166
什么
What?

277
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,366
每隔几分钟 炮火就会往前移
Every few minutes, the artillery barrage?moves forward,

278
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,866
而紧随其后的
and directly behind it,

279
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,533
就是前进的步兵
the infantry advances.

280
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,400
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

281
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,133
他们来了
They're coming.

282
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:34,333
你去哪里
-Where are you going?

283
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:35,599
我马上回来
-I'll be right back.

284
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
弹幕就快结束了
The barrage is nearly over.

285
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:41,033
-不 让我走 -冷静
-No. Let me go. -Calm down.

286
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,533
-放我出去 我想离开这里 -冷静
-Let me out. I want to get out of here. -Calm down!

287

288
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:51,433

Food's there every?morning,

437
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,566
要不然就大闹一场
or you raise a stink.

438
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,533
你还有舒服的床
Then you've got your nice bed,

439
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:31,366
每周有新换的床单
fresh sheets every week.

440
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,766
然后
And then…

441
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,233
然后你可以当士官
Then you make NCO.

442
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:38,233
想象一下
Imagine that.

443
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,100
我当了一个乡警
I'll be a police ranger.

444

这里一杯白兰地 那里一杯啤酒
A cognac here, a pint there.

445
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:45,199
每个人都想和乡警搞好关系 每个人
Everyone wants to be friends with a ranger. Everyone.

446
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,066
但有一个问题 贾登
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

447
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:49,399
什么问题
What's that?

448
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,566
你永远都当不上士官
You'll never make NCO.

449
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,399
你净问些莫名其妙的问题
You always ask such nonsense questions.

450
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,300
根本无济于事
It won't change anything.

451

你让我寄一包吃的过来

455
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,266
四份香肠和猪油在路上了

"Make it last because I don't want to have to send more too soon."

463
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:52,799
最好不要跟你的同志们分享
"Better not share it with your comrades."

464
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,600
我亲爱的小胖仔
"My dear dumpling,

465
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,900
我想问你一件事
I have another question for you."

466
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:00,299
你目前存了多少钱
"How much money have you saved so far?"

467
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:03,366
你能寄些回家吗
"Can you maybe send some home?"

468
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,066
他们说战争很快就要结束了
"They say that the war will be?over soon,

469
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:09,833
有余钱的话自然是好的
so it would be good to have some left over."

470
00:47:11,033 --> 00:47:12,033
现在你会想：
"Now you'll think,

471
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,800
‘这个老女人 脸皮真厚’
listen to the old lady, how cheeky!"

472
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,866
但我不介意
"But no offence."

473
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,666
你知道我的 我永远都嫌不够
"You know me, I can't get enough."

474
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:22,633
我总是要更多 不知足是我的座右铭
"Give me an inch and I'll take a mile."

475
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:25,899
所以你不要在终点前倒下

478
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:35,333
他去前线还没满三周呢
He was hardly out there three weeks."

479
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,533
你有风湿 不能因为生病回家吗
"Can't you get off too, with your rheumatism?"

480
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,466
难道你做得还不够多吗 ”
"You've done your bit."

481

要是她现在能看到你就好了

"On Sunday, I'm visiting our little boy's grave."

485
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,533
我会念书给他听 他一直都很喜欢
"I'm going to read to him. He always liked that so much."

486
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,933
明年我们一起去 庆祝他的十岁生日
"Next year, we'll go together and celebrate his tenth birthday."

487

我亲吻你 我的丈夫

490
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,033
我之前都不知道
I didn't know.

491

And all they'll want to know is if we fought in close combat.

496
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,066
我们会像过往风景中的过客一样
We'll walk around like travellers in a landscape from the past.

497
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,466
我问自己

498
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800

00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,600
我刚刚送德国代表团去进行停火谈判

580
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,299
他们正坐火车去贡比涅
to negotiate a ceasefire.

581
00:59:07,033 --> 00:59:08,599
这些人啊 布里克斯多夫
These people, Brixdorf,

582
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,366
他们要出卖我们的祖国
are selling off our fatherland.

583
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,633
我的命令是战争
My order is war.

584
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:18,366
只要这点不变 我必定会全力奋战
And as long as that's the case, I'll fight tooth and nail.

585
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:22,966
我们必须坚持住 等待新来的援军
We have to hold firm and wait for fresh troops.

586
00:59:23,066 --> 00:59:25,866
再过几个月 新兵就要到了
New recruits are due in a few months.

587
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,533
法国人想将那些狗屁条件强加于我们
The French are trying to force their shitty terms on us.

588
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,000
我不会投降
I will not surrender.

589
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,066
我们现在必须出击
We have to strike now

590
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,600
全力出击
with all our might.

591
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,800
是 将军
Sir.

592
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,533
以我们的立场
For our part,

593
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,533
我坚持要求…
I have to insist…

594
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:16,999
我们坚持要求…
we have to insist…

595
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,866
妈的
For God's sake!

596
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,300
真他妈的
Shit.

597
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:55,266
中尉
Sir!

598
01:01:05,433 --> 01:01:07,099
士兵们 快收拾东西
Soldiers, pack your bags,

599
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,866
把铺盖被罩卷好 把炊具餐具洗了
roll up your bedding and wash your mess kits.

600
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,133
整个团都要向前线进发
The entire regiment is being sent to the front line.

601
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:16,033
凡是两只腿可以站起来的人都要去
We're taking anyone who can stand on two legs.

602
01:01:17,733 --> 01:01:19,799
快点排好队 妈的
Line up, damn it!

603
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:23,633
难道法国人会等着你们梳阴毛吗
You think the French will wait for you to comb your pubes?

604
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:24,866
我们又要走了
Here we go again.

605
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,233
-快点  -去哪里
-Move it! -Where to?

606
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:28,033
“去哪里 ”
Where to?

607
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,500
去打仗啊
Into battle.

608
01:03:04,633 --> 01:03:06,833
元帅在等各位过去
Monsieur le Maréchal is expecting you.

609
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:15,433
我很快就回来
I'll be back soon.

610
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,133
嫉妒吧
Jealous?

611
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:51,533
我站在你们面前
I stand before you

612
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,600
是希望你们能将我们的到访
in the hope that you will take our presence as an opportunity

613
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,600
看作暂停一切敌对活动的契机
to suspend all hostilities.

614
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,800
以人性之名
In the name of humanity,

615
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,966
我请你们同意立即停火
I ask you to agree to an immediate ceasefire

616
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,900
在整个谈判期间都不交战
for the duration of our?negotiations

617
01:05:08,733 --> 01:05:11,933
以免我们各自的国家有不必要的损失
in order to spare our nations any unnecessary losses.

618
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,366
马蒂亚斯埃尔兹伯格
Matthias Erzberger,

619
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,400
德国代表团团长
head of the German delegation.

620
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:34,533
福煦元帅问诸位此行的目的是什么
Marshal Foch asks what brings us gentlemen to him.

621
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,500
我们想听听您的建议
We look forward to your suggestions

622
01:05:41,433 --> 01:05:44,999
看看如何达成最终的停火
for bringing about?a permanent ceasefire at sea,

623
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,400
陆 海 空全线停火
on land and in the air.

624
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:53,599
我对你们没有任何建议
I don't have any suggestions for you.

625
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,566
他这是何意
What does he mean?

626
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,533
我觉得他可能不喜欢您的措辞
I think he might not like how you phrased it.

627
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,200
好吧
Yes.

628
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:06,033
那么 这个…
Okay, then…

629
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:10,599
元帅先生
if you please,

630
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,900
如果您愿意
if you please,

631
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:14,333
我们想知道具体条件
we would like to know the conditions…

632
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:25,566
他想让您正式提出请求
He wants you to formally ask for it.

633
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,300
元帅先生
Monsieur le Maréchal,

634
01:06:36,633 --> 01:06:38,733
我请求您停战
I'm asking you for an armistice.

635
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,633
你们有72小时接受我们的条件
You have 72 hours to accept our conditions.

636
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:54,799
没有商量的余地
They are non-negotiable.

637
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,966
-72小时  -战争将持续到您签字为止
-72 hours? -The war will continue until you sign.

638
01:06:58,066 --> 01:06:59,166
元帅先生
Monsieur le Maréchal,

639
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,066
以上帝之名 别让战争再持续72小时
in the name of God, don't let 72 hours go by.

640
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,866
很多人已经丧命
People are dying out there.

641
01:07:12,933 --> 01:07:13,966
那就签字吧
Sign then.

642
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:30,799
明白了
Understood.

643
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:50,866
让士兵们前进
Soldiers, march.

644
01:07:54,733 --> 01:07:55,866
士兵们 前进
Soldiers, march.

645
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,300
前进吧 士兵们
March, soldiers.

646
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,266
士兵们 前进
Soldiers, march.

647
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:04,766
走吧 快上去
Let's go. Out of here!

648
01:08:06,066 --> 01:08:06,999
前进吧 士兵们
March, soldiers.

649
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,666
前进
March.

650
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,733
士兵们 前进
Soldiers, march.

651
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,900
士兵们 前进 快走
March, soldiers. Out of here!

652
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,800
冲啊
Charge!

653
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,933
-快点  -冲啊
-Faster! -Hooray!

654
01:08:32,033 --> 01:08:34,333
-快点  -冲啊
-Faster! -Hooray!

655
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,533
进攻
Onwards, men!

656
01:08:38,066 --> 01:08:39,066
上
Charge!

657
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,700
冲啊
Hooray!

658
01:08:46,533 --> 01:08:48,333
保持队形
Keep ranks!

659
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:49,866
不要停
Keep going!

660
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,000
快
Go, go, go!

661
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,400
我们走 保罗 快
Let's go, Paul. Come on.

662
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,366
保罗
Paul!

663
01:12:10,366 --> 01:12:11,233
快出去
Get out!

664
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,266
开火
Open fire!

665
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:57,299
开火
Open fire!

666
01:13:39,566 --> 01:13:41,133
趴下
Get down!

667
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:42,333
趴下
Get down!

668
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,433
快找掩护
Take cover!

669
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,700
快出去
Get out of here! Get out!

670
01:14:07,266 --> 01:14:09,799
原地不动 紧密作战
Stay where you are and close ranks!

671
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:33,666
手榴弹
Hand grenades!

672
01:14:34,266 --> 01:14:36,399
他们开到上面的时候 瞄准履带
Aim for the tracks when they're above us.

673
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,566
走 兄弟们
Let's go, men!

674
01:15:02,633 --> 01:15:03,466
快走 弗朗茨
Go! Franz!

675
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:04,799
弗朗茨
Franz!

676
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,333
跟我走
Follow me!

677
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:16,466
弗朗茨
Franz!

678
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:17,999
来 跟我来
Come on! Follow me!

679
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,066
弗朗茨
Franz!

680
01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:23,266
保罗
Go! Come on! Paul!

681
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:39,866
冲啊
Charge!

682
01:16:07,366 --> 01:16:08,166
保罗
Paul.

683
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:09,700
保罗
Paul!

684
01:16:25,733 --> 01:16:26,933
开火
Open fire!

685
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:41,966
撤退
Retreat!

686
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,866
撤退
Retreat!

687
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,166
不要 别开枪
No, don't shoot! No!

688
01:18:01,266 --> 01:18:05,066
不要
No! No!

689
01:18:05,766 --> 01:18:08,199
不要 别开枪
Don't! Don't shoot!

690
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,200
阿尔伯特
Albert.

691
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,300
阿尔伯特
-Albert. -Come on!

692
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,466
快走
Come on!

693
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:27,833
别停下
Keep going!

694
01:18:54,133 --> 01:18:55,299
弗朗茨在哪里
Where's Franz?

695
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,633
弗朗茨不见了
I've lost Franz!

696
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:05,199
凯特因斯基
Katczinsky!

697
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,133
拿好机枪就撤退
Secure the machine gun and retreat!

698
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:10,533
然后往东北两公里到伊吉萨克集合
We'll regroup in Eguisac, two kilometres northeast of here.

699
01:19:12,866 --> 01:19:15,566
我想念我的同伴了 中士
I am missing my comrades, Sergeant!

700
01:19:15,633 --> 01:19:17,799
我还想我妈呢 妈的
And I miss my mother, damn it!

701
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,233
拿上手榴弹和弹药 我们走
Grenades! Ammunition! Let's go!

702
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:23,566
保罗 快走
Paul, come on!

703
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:53,899
这些不是谈判条件 而是律令
This isn't a negotiation. This is a diktat.

704
01:19:54,433 --> 01:19:57,666
也许我们应该回斯帕 跟总参谋部商量一下
Maybe we should return to Spa to consult with the general staff.

705
01:19:57,766 --> 01:19:59,266
您觉得那会有什么用
And what good will that do?

706
01:19:59,766 --> 01:20:01,699
就算我们最终输了
Even if we end up losing,

707
01:20:02,233 --> 01:20:04,633
结果也不会比投降更糟
we won't be any worse off than with this surrender.

708
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,633
但是会多死掉几十万人
Besides a few hundred thousand more deaths.

709
01:20:06,733 --> 01:20:08,366
阿尔萨斯洛林 占领莱因河
Alsace-Lorraine, occupation of the Rhine,

710
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,866
大炮 机车 火车
artillery, locomotives, trains.

711
01:20:10,933 --> 01:20:12,999
这是彻彻底底的投降啊
This is total capitulation!

712
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,400
每个月有25万美国人来到欧洲
250,000 Americans are landing in Europe every month.

713
01:20:17,533 --> 01:20:20,933
马恩 坎蒂尼 康布雷 全部输了
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai, all lost.

714
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:25,166
唯一阻碍我们停火的就是虚无的自尊
The only thing separating us from a ceasefire is false pride.

715
01:20:25,766 --> 01:20:29,266
是时候该处理您和将军们的烂摊子了
It's time to deal with the mess you and your generals have left us.

716
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,566
但如果您想离开 那么请便
But if you'd rather leave now, go ahead.

717
01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:33,166
我们会留在这里
We're staying here.

718
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:40,666
现在是冬天
It's winter.

719
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:44,966
没了火车和物资 布尔什维克会击垮我们
Without trains and provisions, the Bolsheviks will overrun us.

720
01:20:45,866 --> 01:20:47,866
士兵们会在回家的路上饿死
The men will starve on the way home,

721
01:20:47,933 --> 01:20:50,233
而不是在战场上光荣战死
instead of dying with honour on the battlefield.

722
01:20:51,566 --> 01:20:52,366
光荣战死
Honour?

723
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:57,166
我儿子战死了 但他并不感到光荣

01:39:22,866 --> 01:39:23,899
你为什么要这么做
Why did you do that?

872
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,300
为什么
Why?

873
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,933
结束了 兄弟们 都结束了
It's over, boys, it's over.

874
01:39:28,033 --> 01:39:29,599
他血快流光了
He's bleeding out!

875
01:39:34,366 --> 01:39:35,233
贾登
Tjaden.

876
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,266
贾登
Tjaden.

877
01:41:15,933 --> 01:41:16,766
怎么了
What is it?

878
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:20,100
我有样东西不见了
I've lost something.

879
01:41:24,933 --> 01:41:26,233
凯特 你会说法语吗
Kat, can you speak French?

880
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:28,966
比如“请”

881
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,866
我母亲当初要我学法语来着
My mother wanted me to learn French.

882
01:41:35,933 --> 01:41:36,799
这样啊

883
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:41,066
还有钢琴
And piano.

884
01:41:43,533 --> 01:41:45,466
她不希望我上战场
She didn't want me to go to war.

885
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:48,166
她说：“那不是你该做的
"It's not for you," she always said.

886
01:41:48,266 --> 01:41:49,666
你没几天就会死”
"You'll be dead in no time."

887
01:41:52,066 --> 01:41:53,666
我想向他们证明我能做到
I wanted to show them I could do it.

888
01:41:54,866 --> 01:41:56,099
结果我们是这种境遇
How does that help us now?

889
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,433
还说什么再过几周就到巴黎了
"In a few weeks, we'll be in Paris."

890
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,566
不断扔手榴弹的这两年
I can't discard two years of hand grenades

891
01:42:05,633 --> 01:42:07,233
可不像臭袜子说脱就脱
like a pair of socks.

892
01:42:07,366 --> 01:42:08,166
保罗
-Paul…

893
01:42:08,266 --> 01:42:10,066
我们永远无法去除这股恶臭
-We'll never get rid of the stench.

894
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,100
-够了 -路德维希死了 弗朗茨死了
-Enough. -Ludwig's dead, Franz,

895
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,800
-阿尔伯特… -这关我们什么事
Albert… What's it to us now?

896
01:42:15,233 --> 01:42:16,299
他们安息了
At least they're at peace.

897
01:42:16,866 --> 01:42:17,733
我们还活着
We're alive.

898
01:42:25,866 --> 01:42:27,466
这里的一切就像发烧一样
All of this is like a fever.

899
01:42:28,266 --> 01:42:30,399
没人真的想要发烧 但它突然就来了
No one actually wants it, but suddenly it's here.

900
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,766
我们不想要 其他人也不想要
We didn't want it, the others didn't want it.

901
01:42:33,866 --> 01:42:36,799
但我们来了 全世界也卷进来一半
And yet, here we are. And yet, half the world is here.

902
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,100
上帝就这样看着
And God watches on

903
01:42:39,766 --> 01:42:40,799
看着我们彼此屠杀
as we slaughter each other.

904
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,466
就是这样
Well…

905
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:51,400
但我又知道什么呢
But what do I know?

906
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:53,033
我什么都不知道
I know nothing.

907
01:42:53,733 --> 01:42:55,466
我是一双带着步枪的靴子
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

908
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,966
去睡吧 我们运气好
Get some sleep. We got lucky.

909
01:42:59,866 --> 01:43:00,666
好
Yes.

910
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,666
凯特
Kat?

911
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,666
嗯

912
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,366
你儿子是怎么死的
What did your son die of?

913
01:43:30,766 --> 01:43:31,566
天花
Smallpox.

914
01:43:39,933 --> 01:43:41,433
我害怕接下来会发生的事
I'm afraid of what's to come.

915
01:43:49,133 --> 01:43:49,966
别怕
Don't be.

916
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,100
亨利
Henri.

917
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:27,800
尝尝
Taste it.

918
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:32,966
这是今天做的吗
Are they fresh?

919
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,833
对不起 先生 应该不是
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think so.

920
01:45:10,866 --> 01:45:12,166
我听着呢
I'm listening.

921
01:45:12,266 --> 01:45:13,999
皇帝已经退位了
The Kaiser has abdicated.

922
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,833
士兵们拒绝服从命令
Soldiers are refusing to obey?orders.

923
01:45:16,933 --> 01:45:18,633
逃兵在乡下游荡
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

924
01:45:18,733 --> 01:45:23,799
新政府将尽全力履行需要担当的职责
The new government will do its utmost to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

925
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:28,266
但是并没有犯错的平民百姓
but the population, through no fault of its own,

926
01:45:28,366 --> 01:45:30,733
却可能面临饥荒和无政府混乱
risks descending into famine?and anarchy.

927
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,000
这是败者的问题 而非胜者的问题
This is a disease of the defeated, not of the victorious.

928
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,466
我不怕
I don't fear it.

929
01:45:35,566 --> 01:45:37,166
我拒绝任何妥协
I reject any compromise.

930
01:45:38,933 --> 01:45:40,999
元帅先生 拜托了

931
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:45,466
请公平对待您的对手 否则和平会令其愤懑
Be fair to your enemy, otherwise he will hate this peace.

932
01:45:45,566 --> 01:45:46,499
公平
Fair?

933
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,833
您还要谈公平
You speak of fairness?

934
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,700
签字吧
Sign it.

935
01:47:11,433 --> 01:47:13,766
会议记录将写明
Let the minutes record

936
01:47:14,266 --> 01:47:17,899

The French are farting into our posts in Latierre,

947
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,933
外面还有一火车的王八蛋
and out there is a train full of horse fuckers,

948
01:48:05,033 --> 01:48:06,666
想要出卖祖国

949
01:48:10,533 --> 01:48:12,333
让所有新兵撤离兵营

几点了
What time is it?

958
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,366

不知道
-I don't know.

971
01:49:51,766 --> 01:49:52,799
我要烤鹅吃

好遥远啊
It's all so far away.

983

其实并不遥远 很快就到了
But it isn't. It's very soon.

984

我们想再要一个孩子

985
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,066
好几个孩子 保罗
Children, Paul.

986
01:50:26,133 --> 01:50:28,733
没有孩子的圣诞节算什么 没意义
Because what's Christmas without children? It's nothing.

987
01:50:29,266 --> 01:50:30,133
对吧

988
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,066

The two of us together, okay?

992

993
01:50:43,733 --> 01:50:44,533
怎么了
What?

994
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,966
我是补鞋匠 保罗
I'm a cobbler, Paul.

995
01:50:47,066 --> 01:50:49,066
我是修鞋的 懂吗
I repair shoes. Yeah?

996
01:50:49,133 --> 01:50:52,199
你懂得读书写字 你有高中文凭

997
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:54,333

998
01:50:55,533 --> 01:50:56,599
那我们做什么
What are we going to do?

999
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:59,166
给鞋子钉鞋底 我们两个
Nail soles on shoes together?

1000
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,833
你是想羞辱我吗
Are you trying to insult me?

1001
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,733
我连我老婆的信都看不懂
I can't even read a letter from my wife.

1002
01:51:05,233 --> 01:51:06,366
你要去读书 保罗
Go to college, Paul.

1003
01:51:07,533 --> 01:51:08,899
不然我现在就毙了你

1004
01:51:11,366 --> 01:51:12,299
我的裤子要掉了

1006
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:20,766
你多吃一点就好了
You'll just have to eat a little.

1007
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:24,400
很快我们就回家了 想吃什么随便吃

随便吃
Whatever we want.

1009
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,400
该你了
It's your turn.

1010
01:51:53,233 --> 01:51:55,099
如果养鹅的再发现我的话
If the farmer catches me again,

1011
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:56,600
他应该会开枪打我
he'll shoot me.

1012
01:52:01,566 --> 01:52:02,833
小心那条臭狗
Watch out for the damn dog.

1013
01:52:03,366 --> 01:52:04,233

01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,100

Shit.

1019
01:54:24,133 --> 01:54:25,233

快看
Look at this.

1026
01:55:10,033 --> 01:55:11,033
怎么了
What is it?

1027
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:12,133
我运气太好了

1030
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,266
-全都倒进去 -好
Come on, get?

1031
01:55:24,033 --> 01:55:24,899
全倒进去
it all in there. All of it.

1032
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:28,966
我们可以煎了吃
We can fry them.

1033
01:55:29,633 --> 01:55:31,366
胡说八道 我们现在就吃
Nonsense. We'll eat them right now.

1034
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,400
这样也行
Like this is fine too.

1035
01:55:51,366 --> 01:55:52,466
这味道简直了
Doesn't get better than that.

1036
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:55,100
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1037
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,400
凯特
Kat?

1038
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,466
凯特
Kat?

1039
01:57:43,933 --> 01:57:44,799
凯特
Kat!

1040
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,033
怎么了
What happened?

1041
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:49,733
我们走
Let's go.

1042
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:52,700
谁开的枪
-Who fired the shot?

1043
01:57:53,233 --> 01:57:54,499
养鹅场的小屁孩
-The little shit from the farm.

1044
01:57:55,633 --> 01:57:56,866
养鹅户的儿子
The farmer's boy.

1045
01:57:58,866 --> 01:57:59,799
凯特
Kat!

1046
01:58:01,233 --> 01:58:02,166
真是一团糟
What a mess.

1047
01:58:10,266 --> 01:58:11,133

How big?

1048

1049
01:58:13,066 --> 01:58:13,966
我把子弹弄出来
I'll get the bullet out.

1050
01:58:14,066 --> 01:58:16,133
不 给我一根烟就好
No, just give me a cigarette.

1051
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:18,566
让医护员来吧
Leave that to the?medic.

1052
01:58:37,366 --> 01:58:39,599
他们让我和七岁的孩子一起上课
They stuck me in a class of seven-year-olds.

1053
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:42,733
我当时已经开始刮胡子了
I had already started shaving.

1054
01:58:44,433 --> 01:58:49,099
找一个跟“骨气”押韵的词
Find a word… that rhymes with trifle.

1055
01:58:52,866 --> 01:58:55,566
没有词和骨气押韵啊 没有
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1056
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:03,566
真他妈的
For Christ's sake!

1057
01:59:04,766 --> 01:59:06,633
为什么要偏偏挑这个时候
Did it have to happen now, of all times?

1058
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:12,466
-来吧 我们得走了 -好
-We have to keep going. -Yeah.

1059
01:59:13,366 --> 01:59:14,366
走吧
Keep going.

1060

武器和骨气押韵
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1064
01:59:37,533 --> 01:59:41,133
回家之后 你得给我做一双新靴子
When we get home, you're going to make me a new pair of boots.

1065
01:59:41,233 --> 01:59:42,866
我的脚都走出血了
I'm walking my feet bloody.

1066

医护员
Medic!

1073
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,533
其实你不用白费力气
You could've saved yourself the trouble.

1074
02:01:33,633 --> 02:01:34,466
啊

1075
02:01:35,733 --> 02:01:36,833
他死了
He's dead.

1076
02:01:42,133 --> 02:01:44,566

对 血都黑了 直接进入了肝脏
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1078
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,933
器官中毒了
His organs are poisoned.

1079
02:01:56,266 --> 02:01:57,366
他是昏过去了
Unconscious.

1080
02:01:58,366 --> 02:01:59,166
不

1081
02:01:59,733 --> 02:02:00,666
他死了
He's dead.

1082
02:02:01,433 --> 02:02:02,999
这个我应该比你懂
I know more about these things.

1083
02:02:05,066 --> 02:02:07,833
不可能 我刚才还跟他说话来着

1084
02:02:08,366 --> 02:02:12,433
他是昏过去了
He's unconscious. He's unconscious.

1085
02:02:19,766 --> 02:02:20,666
你看到了吗
You see?

1086
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:25,366
他很倒霉 眼看就要到终点了
He was just unlucky. So close to the end.

1087
02:03:49,633 --> 02:03:50,866
走吧 士兵
Come along, soldier!

1088
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,833
将军让我们回家了
The General's sending us home!

1089

我们作为兄弟站在这里
we stand here as brothers

1096
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,333
在敌人的世界里
in a world of enemies,

1097
02:04:52,433 --> 02:04:56,333
我们被迫看着德国社会民主党人
forced to watch as German social democrats render

1098
02:04:56,433 --> 02:04:58,633
让我们亲爱的人民毫无还手之力

1099
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:02,800
因为他们接受了卑鄙叛国的停战协议
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1100
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:05,000
同志们
Comrades,

1101

1106
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:25,800
但是 同志们
But, comrades,

1107
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:30,300
你们想被当成战士和英雄受到欢迎
do you want to be welcomed as soldiers and heroes,

1108
02:05:32,266 --> 02:05:36,399
还是被视作在关键时刻退缩的懦夫
or as cowards who chickened out when it really came down to it?

1109
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:38,466
士兵们
Soldiers,

1110
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:43,200
我们要竭尽全力向他们发动进攻
we're going to strike now with all our rigour and might.

1111
02:05:43,933 --> 02:05:46,666
拉蒂尔属于德国人
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1112
02:05:47,633 --> 02:05:50,333
我们要在11点前占领平原
We will seize the plains before 11 a.m.

1113
02:05:50,433 --> 02:05:52,033
让这场战争
and end this war

1114
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,900
以胜利告终
with a victory!

1115
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:55,866
冲啊

1116
02:05:55,933 --> 02:05:57,933
上帝会与我们同在
Onwards with God who will be with us,

1117
02:05:58,033 --> 02:06:00,033
就像他与我们的父辈同在一样
as He was with our fathers.

1118
02:06:01,633 --> 02:06:04,299
我不会回去战斗的 我不干
I'm not going back into battle. Not me!

1119
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:05,566

Shut up!

1120
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:15,400
瞄准
Take aim!

这是勒菲弗的

1130
02:08:05,266 --> 02:08:07,033
那可怜的小子想留到结束时喝的
Poor bastard. He saved it for the end.

1131
02:08:07,766 --> 02:08:08,833
他再也不需要了
-He won't need it any more.

1132
02:08:09,366 --> 02:08:10,366
谢谢长官
-Thank you, sir.

1133
