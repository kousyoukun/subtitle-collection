1
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:46,359
So this is the world, and there are
almost six billion people on it.

2
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,921
When I was a kid, there were three.

3
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,933
It's hard to keep up.

4
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:55,163
There. That's better.

5
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:56,830
That's America.

6
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:59,670
America still sets the tone
for the world.

7
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:06,074
In Indiana, Clark Hodd, 13,
the best point guard in the country.

8
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:08,742
Last week he scored
a hundred points...

9
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,649
in a single game.

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,486
Erica Sorgi.
You'll see her in the next Olympics.

11
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:19,085
In Seattle, Dallas Malloy, 16.

12
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:22,392
Her lawsuit helped pave the way
for women boxers everywhere.

13
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:25,730
She's picturing
her ex-boyfriend right now.

14
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:29,436
In Indio, California, Art Stallings.

15
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:32,235
Check out what pure joy looks like.

16
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:36,335
In Odessa, Texas,
the great Frank Cushman.

17
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:39,677
This April, 26 teams will be
falling all over themselves...

18
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:42,240
to sign him in the next NFL draft.

19
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,878
He's my client,
my most important client.

20
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:47,980
When are you gonna try?
You wanna be a champion?

21
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:51,083
Believe me, there's genius everywhere,
but until they turn pro...

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,253
it's like popcorn in the pan...
some pop...

23
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:56,492
Darn it! You don't know
diddly-squat about golf!

24
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,089
Some don't.

25
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:02,203
I'm the guy you don't usually see.

26
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:05,900
I'm the one behind the scenes.
I'm the sports agent.

27
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:08,876
I'm gonna hurt you this year.

28
00:02:08,944 --> 00:02:10,878
How you doin'? I'm doing fine.

29
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:13,471
The door is always open
if you want a real agent.

30
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,483
You're welcome, Johnnie.

31
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:18,418
I'm gonna go to a meeting now,
and I'm gonna talk about you.

32
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:20,011
I'll kill for you.

33
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:22,649
- We gotta win Super Bowls.
- I hail you.

34
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,193
- Hey, Jerry, how you doin'?
- Good.

35
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,990
How much will this cost me?

36
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,056
We both know there's a number you
can afford. I'll write it down...

37
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,863
and we can move forward from there.

38
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:38,236
- I can't afford that.
- No one said winning was cheap.

39
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:41,242
You know those photos where
the new player holds a team jersey...

40
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,005
and poses with the owner?

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,944
That's me on the left.

42
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,608
Inside that building,
that's where I work.

43
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:50,015
SMI, Sports Management
International.

44
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,383
Thirty-three out-of-shape agents
guiding the careers of...

45
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:58,450
1,685 of the most finely tuned
athletes alive.

46
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:00,859
- You gotta be tough.
- I already have 18 million...

47
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,367
I handle 72 clients and get
an average of 264 phone calls a day.

48
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,061
It's what I do.

49
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,730
I will not rest until I have you
holding a Coke, wearing your own shoe...

50
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:12,399
playing a Sega game featuring you
while singing your own song...

51
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,136
in a new commercial starring you...

52
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,474
broadcast during the Super Bowl
in a game that you are winning.

53
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:18,775
- I will not sleep until that happens.
- It's what I do best.

54
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,338
You get 15 minutes to call me back.

55
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:24,477
I'll be honest. I started noticing it
a few years ago and didn't say a word.

56
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:27,021
Was the girl 16 or 17?

57
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,956
In the quest for the big dollars, a lot
of the little things were going wrong.

58
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,788
There's no proof of anything...

59
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:35,024
except this guy is
a sensational athlete.

60
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,400
Are you Calvin Nack?
Can you sign my card?

61
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm sorry, little fella.
I can't sign this brand of card.

62
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:46,969
Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.

63
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,075
I just wanted an autograph.

64
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,138
Lately, it's gotten worse.

65
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:56,241
Remo with the puck and...
Oh, he goes down!

66
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,120
Hi, baby.

67
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:02,952
You know your name?

68
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,123
Steve Remo.

69
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:12,257
Wait. It's comin'.

70
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,237
- My name is Steve Remo.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:17,067
I play for Chicago.

72
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,630
This lady here is my wife.

73
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,471
Hi, baby.

74
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:24,513
And this is my boy.
And this is...

75
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:28,582
Wait.

76
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,818
My agent. My agent.

77
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:33,582
I gotta play this weekend, Doc.

78
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:37,183
If I play in 65 percent
of my games, I get a bonus.

79
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,692
I gotta get the bonus.

80
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:43,465
Okay, Jesse,
you take care, little guy.

81
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,261
- Mr. Maguire.
- Yeah?

82
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:49,134
This is his fourth concussion.
Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?

83
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:53,508
It would take a tank
to stop your dad.

84
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,635
It would take all five...

85
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:58,612
Super Trooper VRwarriors...

86
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,706
to stop your dad.

87
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:02,375
Right?

88
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,146
Right?

89
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,082
Fuck you.

90
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:15,290
Who had I become?
Just another shark in a suit?

91
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,777
...with the skyrocketing salaries...

92
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,683
and you are one of
the guys responsible.

93
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:41,052
- Fuck you.
- This guy is a sensational athlete.

94
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:46,525
Two days later, at our corporate
conference in Miami, a breakthrough.

95
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:49,029
I already had
18 million on the table...

96
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,566
Breakdown? Breakthrough.

97
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:54,228
- I just wanted an autograph.
- Fuck you.

98
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,895
Do you know your name?

99
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:00,742
I couldn't escape one simple thought.

100
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,540
I hated myself.

101
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:08,177
No, here's what it was.

102
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:11,880
I hated my place in the world.

103
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:21,262
I had so much to say
and no one to listen.

104
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,466
And then it happened.

105
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:33,338
It was the oddest,
most unexpected thing.

106
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,037
I began writing what they call
a mission statement.

107
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,409
Not a memo, a mission statement.

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,506
You know, a suggestion
for the future of our company.

109
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,345
A night like this
doesn't come along very often.

110
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,014
I seized it.

111
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:53,851
What started out
as one page became 25.

112
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:57,194
Suddenly I was my father's son again.

113
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,030
I was remembering
the simple pleasures of this job...

114
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:02,036
how I ended up here
out of law school...

115
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:06,268
the way a stadium sounds when one of
my players performs well on the field...

116
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:10,870
the way we are meant to protect them
in health and in injury.

117
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:15,144
With so many clients,
we had forgotten what was important.

118
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:18,482
I wrote and wrote
and wrote and wrote...

119
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:20,545
and I'm not even a writer.

120
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:23,387
I was remembering even the words
of the original sports agent...

121
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,893
my mentor... the late,
great Dicky Fox... who said:

122
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:29,954
The key to this business
is personal relationships.

123
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,000
Suddenly it was all pretty clear.

124
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,662
The answer was fewer clients,
less money.

125
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,206
More attention. Caring for them.

126
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:40,503
Caring for ourselves.
And the games too.

127
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:44,068
Just starting our lives, really.

128
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,137
I'll be the first to admit it.

129
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,651
What I was writing was
somewhat touchy-feely.

130
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:53,313
I didn't care.
I had lost the ability to bullshit.

131
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,119
It was the me
I'd always wanted to be.

132
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:02,423
I took it to a Copymat
in the middle of the night...

133
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,557
and printed up 110 copies.

134
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,227
Even the cover looked like
The Catcher in the Rye.

135
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,236
I entitled it...

136
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:14,264
The Things We Think and Do Not Say:
The Future of Our Business.

137
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,378
That's how you become great, man.

138
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,582
Hang your balls out there.

139
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:23,849
Thanks.

140
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,784
Everybody got a copy.

141
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:30,086
There are dangerous animals in the world
and some of them walk on two feet.

142
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,389
They don't want peace
and they're not capable of love.

143
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,796
Society... and that means
you and you and you...

144
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,832
need protection
from these warped minds.

145
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,577
Boom.

146
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:57,918
This is Jerry Maguire.

147
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:00,955
- Did those manuscripts get...
- They've all gone out.

148
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:04,220
They did? Oh, no, no, no.

149
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,454
That's fine. Thank you.

150
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:25,109
Front desk.
How may I help you?

151
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,520
- All right!
- Finally, somebody said it.

152
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,025
Good work, Maguire!

153
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,835
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

154
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,680
I was 35.

155
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,446
I'd started my life.

156
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:07,784
How long do you give him?

157
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:09,448
About a week.

158
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:22,164
- So you're with the sports people?
- I'm Jerry Maguire.

159
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:25,331
- SMI.
- Bobbi Fallon, BPI.

160
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,671
I'm producing the Coke commercials
for the play-offs.

161
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,540
Good luck with that.

162
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,238
That'll be four dollars.

163
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:35,682
Hi. My son is really allergic
to the material in the blankets.

164
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,412
That's all we have, okay?

165
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:45,022
I'm sorry if I was rude just then.

166
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:48,358
That's okay.
We're in it together now.

167
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,523
Why is it so easy to talk with you?

168
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,090
- Tell me about your fiancee.
- More champagne?

169
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:55,227
I don't think we're
quite at your pitch yet.

170
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:58,603
- Tell me how you proposed.
- Are you all right? You want some juice?

171
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:02,175
Thank you.

172
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,805
But we're hiking up
through the pools.

173
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:09,476
Got the ring in my pocket,
and I'm a little nervous.

174
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:14,820
I'm lagging, you know,
and she says to me... get this...

175
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,721
"Hurry up, klutz."

176
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:20,023
Well, it bothered me somewhat,
and I got quiet.

177
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,687
Then she got quiet.

178
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,424
And I decide...

179
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,432
I am not gonna propose.

180
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,264
The mood is not right.
Why be impulsive?

181
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,430
At this point, I know she knows...

182
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:33,599
that I was gonna propose and didn't,
and she knows I know.

183
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,439
- We check back into the Pro Bowl Hotel.
- How sad.

184
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,773
But wait.

185
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:42,613
Now, little do I know that my assistant
has assumed that I've now proposed.

186
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:46,245
So she's gotten the lounge band
to play "Here Comes the Bride"...

187
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:48,949
- when we walk back in.
- I love that song.

188
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,458
All the football guys
are in the lobby watching.

189
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:53,960
There's even an ESPN crew.

190
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,760
So I turn to her,
sort of grandly say...

191
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,802
"Well, this is me... klutz...

192
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,737
asking you, goddess of
rock climbing, to marry me."

193
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:08,799
I took out the ring...
I don't much like big scenes...

194
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,811
but...

195
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,746
she said yes right there
in the lobby.

196
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:17,046
Some of the toughest men
in football wept like babies.

197
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,812
I'm getting married in February.

198
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,358
You two are gonna
be married forever.

199
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:24,120
You two are gonna
be married forever.

200
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,194
What's wrong, Mom?

201
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,599
First class is what's wrong, honey.

202
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:39,138
It used to be a better meal.
Now it's a better life.

203
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,346
Ray!

204
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,452
Come on, buddy!

205
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,785
High five!

206
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:56,551
Oh, God. Ray!

207
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,991
Excuse me. Can I help you?

208
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:01,896
Jerry Maguire.

209
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:05,491
I work in your office.
I was on the junket.

210
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,263
I know who you are.
You're Dorothy Boyd in Accounts.

211
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:11,864
You have the side-middle cubicle with
the poster of Albert Einstein's face...

212
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,703
morphed on Shaquille O'Neal's body.

213
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:16,968
That's pretty good.

214
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:19,138
What did you lose here?

215
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,739
My son, my mind.

216
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,341
Your son.

217
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:28,451
While I go look... Dorothy?

218
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,886
While I look for him, why don't you
grab this curious gentleman here?

219
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:37,623
Thank God.

220
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:44,301
You scared me.
You scared me.

221
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:47,900
- Don't do that again, ever.
- Okay, Mommy.

222
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,739
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

223
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,472
- Okay? Ever!
- Dorothy?

224
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,710
- Take care.
- Thank you so much.

225
00:13:58,153 --> 00:14:00,986
I loved your memo, by the way.

226
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:06,057
- You did?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:10,995
Thanks.

228
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:14,092
Actually, it was just
a mission statement.

229
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:17,104
In this age, optimism like that
is a revolutionary act.

230
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:19,538
- You think so?
- Yeah.

231
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,577
I appreciate that because
I didn't know if I should write...

232
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:25,909
I mean, it was 2:00 in the morning.

233
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:29,417
I don't know. Some of the stuff
I just... Whoo! You know?

234
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:31,975
That part about how
we should embrace...

235
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:34,454
"what is still virginal
in our enthusiasm..."

236
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:36,286
Not right now, honey.

237
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,519
"And force open the tightly
clenched fist of commerce...

238
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:41,391
and give a little back
for the greater good."

239
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,296
- Uh-huh.
- God. I was inspired.

240
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:48,063
- And I'm an accountant, you know?
- One, two, three, swing!

241
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:52,004
To respect yourself enough
to say it out loud?

242
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:56,443
To put yourself out there
like that, so openly, so nakedly?

243
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,102
- I don't know.
- Swing!

244
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,842
It got me.

245
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:06,952
Is this bothering you?

246
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,546
No, this is...

247
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,157
great.

248
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:14,059
- This is great.
- One, two, three, swing!

249
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,496
- Do you need a ride? You're okay?
- What?

250
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:21,093
- Do you need a lift?
- Oh, no.

251
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,831
Yeah, I'm sure that
would just make your day...

252
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,066
to drive us all the way
to Manhattan Beach...

253
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:29,770
making that left on Waterloo Street,
playing chicken with oncoming traffic...

254
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,837
your life flashing before your eyes.

255
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:36,315
I've obviously had
too much coffee, huh?

256
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:38,852
It's no problem.

257
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,617
There's my sister Laurel
to pick us up.

258
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,249
- Thank you.
- Sure.

259
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:51,696
A pleasure.

260
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,498
Bye.

261
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:04,441
Hey, Ray. Hey, you.
I'm double-parked. Let's go.

262
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,208
Oh, sorry, honey.

263
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,010
Is this everything?

264
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,018
- These three?
- Come here. Let me see you.

265
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:17,890
Man, whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

266
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:23,595
Don't ever stop fucking me!

267
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,299
Sooner or later
I will have to stop.

268
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,035
Never been better!

269
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,904
Never better!

270
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:40,046
Open your eyes.

271
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:45,075
If you ever want me to be
with another woman for you...

272
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:46,643
I would do it.

273
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:48,484
I'm not interested in it.

274
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:50,752
There was a time
it felt normal for me...

275
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:52,588
but it was a phase...

276
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:55,186
a college thing,
like torn Levi's...

277
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,857
or law school for you.

278
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,163
Want anything from the kitchen?
I'm gonna get some fruit.

279
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:10,976
I don't think we need to do the thing
where we tell each other everything.

280
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,344
Jerry, this is what intimacy is.

281
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:17,511
Don't forget, tomorrow
we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.

282
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,180
I know about the bachelor party.

283
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,849
Your buddy Dooler worked his ass off
to make you a tribute film.

284
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:26,223
All those guys from the office
are coming. Everybody loves you.

285
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,728
Just calm down, relax...

286
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,528
act surprised
and have an amazing time.

287
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:34,228
Oh, no!

288
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,735
Told ya!

289
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:41,405
Oh, my God. All right.

290
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:42,909
You! You!

291
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,412
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Congratulations.

292
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,139
Got you, man!

293
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,649
Got you!

294
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,554
Ethan Valhere.

295
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,420
Old college buddy.

296
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,721
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

297
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,552
- For you.
- Thank you.

298
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,326
And this is for you...
the finest cigar...

299
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,959
my club has to offer.

300
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,299
This is what it's all about, man.

301
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,805
Everybody loves you.

302
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,742
Pisses me off.

303
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:21,172
Whether you're country,
redneck or a freak...

304
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:22,807
young or old...

305
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,546
from Moscow, London or Memphis...

306
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,521
Jerry Maguire will still be
the king of rock 'n'roll to me.

307
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,250
Little black book.

308
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,819
When I think aboutJerry,
my heart starts pounding.

309
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,090
I knowJerry pretty well.

310
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:40,694
Remember me?

311
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,703
- We still on for lunch tomorrow?
- Yeah.

312
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,932
He was no slouch in bed.

313
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,373
This is the funniest thing
I've ever seen. I'll see you later.

314
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:53,005
It's probably a good idea thatJerry
get married. He won't be alone.

315
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:55,641
- He cannot be alone.
- He can't be alone.

316
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,116
He's almost phobic.

317
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,551
Jerry is great at friendship.

318
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,851
He's just really bad at intimacy.

319
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:04,448
- He can't be alone.
- He can't be alone.

320
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,694
- He can't say, "I love you."
- Are you listening, Jerry?

321
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:10,526
Lies, lies, lies.
He's an agent. He lies.

322
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:13,533
- I love you too.
- Hey. Love you too.

323
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,965
- Love you too.
- Love you, Jerry.

324
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,472
- I love you, man.
- I love you.

325
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:23,537
I love you.

326
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:41,823
- Good morning, Jenny.
- Sorry I missed the bachelor party.

327
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:45,388
Good morning. Marcee's already
in your office, and she's late...

328
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,765
for her plane back to Phoenix.

329
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:54,335
I'm glad you finally made it.
Rod is very upset. Tyson!

330
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:56,274
- No.
- Okay, Mommy.

331
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:59,745
- Tyson, hello.
- Hello, Jerry. Long time no see!

332
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:03,443
- What did I say, Tyson?
- How can I make your life better?

333
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,681
This is humiliating, and I'm
pregnant and incapable of bullshit.

334
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:08,689
Where is our offer from Arizona?

335
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:10,349
Cronin's okay for lunch?

336
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:13,952
This is one of our agent's, Bob Sugar,
and he needs to learn to knock.

337
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:15,791
You called our house, right?

338
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,025
I'm sorry to interrupt you guys.

339
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:20,932
I don't know what you do
for your four percent...

340
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,937
but my husband has
a whole plan, an image.

341
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,805
And when you put him in a Waterbed
Warehouse commercial... excuse me...

342
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:31,209
you're making him common when you
know we deserve the big four:

343
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,180
Shoe, car, clothing line,
soft drink.

344
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,116
I know about the four jewels
of the celebrity endorsement dollar.

345
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:38,550
Wow.

346
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,215
I majored in marketing, and so did
my husband. We came to play.

347
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,781
The Dirty Man is back!

348
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,926
Hey, buddy.

349
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,567
You okay?

350
00:20:58,139 --> 00:20:59,731
Fine. What's up?

351
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,571
Came here to let you go.

352
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:07,336
- Pardon me?
- Came here to fire you, Jerry.

353
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,120
It's real.
You should say something.

354
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:24,397
- Happy birthday to you
- Oh, shit.

355
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:30,334
A crowded restaurant
so there won't be a scene.

356
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:42,180
You...

357
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,810
ungrateful, unctuous...

358
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,548
You did this to yourself.
You said fewer clients, on paper.

359
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,216
Jesus Christ. What about me?

360
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,885
You know what I went through,
knowing I had to fire my mentor?

361
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:54,792
Carrying that around for a week?

362
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:57,229
Could you get past yourself
for a second?

363
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,699
You'll lose.

364
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,394
- You wanted smaller.
- I'm over it.

365
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:04,495
Now I want all my clients
and yours too.

366
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,073
Whatever.

367
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:26,726
Bring me my numbers.

368
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:44,970
- This is Cush.
- Cush! It's Sugar.

369
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:48,641
I'm calling you first 'cause you're
the most important guy in sports.

370
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:51,480
I want to know one thing.
How does it feel to be a legend?

371
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:55,580
I just want to play football.
Dad! It's one of the agents.

372
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:57,887
Wendy, Cushman's line is busy!

373
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,918
Keep calling him till you get through!
And please bring me my numbers!

374
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:03,486
J.J., what's up, kid?

375
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,999
Yeah, boy.
Have you talked to Maguire?

376
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,557
Homeboy had a meltdown.

377
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:11,435
I was talking to Doritos about you,
and they're very interested in you.

378
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,667
Hold on. Talk to Rick, okay?
Martinez.

379
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:18,812
Right now you're paying 25 percent
of your endorsements to SMI.

380
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,474
I would cut my commission
by seven percent.

381
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:25,212
I don't wanna say if it was
drug-induced, but the guy freaked out.

382
00:23:25,286 --> 00:23:27,948
I don't know if you want a guy like that
representing you going into the draft.

383
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:29,614
There. I said my piece.

384
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:32,854
I'm gonna make this decision
easy for you, okay?

385
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:35,418
Just what does your heart tell you?

386
00:23:37,932 --> 00:23:39,593
I'm sorry to hear that.

387
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,269
I can't believe they fired him.
He's gone.

388
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:46,100
What's going on?

389
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,575
They fired Jerry Maguire.
Did it at Cronin's.

390
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,771
SMI. This is Cleo.

391
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:00,320
I think you're making a big mistake.

392
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:03,323
I'm concerned about
your family and your future.

393
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:05,484
If you stay here,
I don't know what's gonna happen.

394
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,018
I'm sorry. I have a longstanding
relationship with SMI.

395
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:11,930
Do you think Maguire knows
what it's like to be a black guy?

396
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,729
Bob Sugar? He's...

397
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,266
He's an entertaining, funny...

398
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:20,535
I don't know what it's like to be
a black person? I'm Mr. Black People!

399
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:24,135
Like I say, don't make it
harder than it is.

400
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,146
I've gotta be honest with you.

401
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,774
This is very personally
distressing for me.

402
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,751
I haven't seen you since we were
with that stripper. Remember her name?

403
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,753
I do. It was April.
That's my job...

404
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:36,517
to remember the names of skanks
you bang on the road.

405
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:38,559
It's not about the money.
I do it all for you.

406
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:41,527
This is Jerry Maguire
still holding for Katarina.

407
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:43,154
I'm talking about money.

408
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,859
I gotta tell ya,
it's been a great day.

409
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:49,198
Are you in or out? It's not
show friends. It's show business.

410
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:51,871
You are in.

411
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:54,134
- He can't do shit.
- That's good.

412
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,700
I want to cry for what
they did to you at SMI.

413
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,942
If we weren't right in
the middle of the Acura deal...

414
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,074
you know I'd go with you.

415
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,752
Oh, God!

416
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,549
Call waiting.
Who could be calling me now?

417
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:15,095
Hi. Kathy Sanders.

418
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:16,357
It's still me.

419
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,860
Kathy... Why are you crying?

420
00:25:24,405 --> 00:25:25,838
So you're in.

421
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,008
Rod? Jerry Maguire.
How're you doin'?

422
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:34,147
- How're you doin'?
- I'll tell you how I'm doin'.

423
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:36,911
I'm sweatin', dude!
I'm sweatin' my contract.

424
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:40,886
I'm sweatin' Bob Sugar telling me I'm
missing endorsements by being with you.

425
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:43,287
That's how I'm doin'.
You know what I'm sayin'?

426
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:45,291
I hear you.
That's why I'm calling.

427
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,455
I hear that you hear what I'm saying,
but do you truly hear what I'm saying?

428
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,589
I hear what you're saying, Daddy.

429
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,430
Maybe the best thing is that
we get together in person.

430
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:57,027
Would you mind holding?
I just got someone...

431
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,471
Didn't you tell my wife,
"More personal attention"?

432
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,271
Did you not tell my wife,
"More personal attention"?

433
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:06,140
I said, "More personal attention."

434
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:09,650
Good, 'cause we're just getting started
on my list of things you need to know.

435
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:11,275
You can take notes.

436
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:14,253
I will kill for you, maim for you,
rape and pillage for you.

437
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,519
I am a valuable commodity.
I go across the middle.

438
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:21,255
I see a dude coming at me,
trying to kill me, I tell myself...

439
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,194
"Get killed. Catch the ball."

440
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:26,324
Touchdown.
I make miracles happen.

441
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,391
Are you in, or are you out?

442
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:32,166
I'm from Arizona.
I broke Arizona records.

443
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,641
I went to Arizona State.
I'm a Sun Devil, man.

444
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,143
Now you want Arizona dollars.

445
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:39,304
- Exactly.
- I understand what you're saying.

446
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,644
I'm sitting here
with an ant problem.

447
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:44,310
I got ants going up
and down my hallway.

448
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:47,081
My brother Tee Pee's room
is flooded with...

449
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:51,592
We got a flood in Tee Pee's room.
Hang on. Say hello toJerry Maguire.

450
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,627
Hello, Brother Maguire.

451
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:56,663
- Hello, Tee Pee.
- My house is falling apart!

452
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:58,995
Nobody's looking out for Rod Tidwell.

453
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,000
We don't know where
we're gonna live in a year.

454
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:04,128
And I'm supposed to be
a superstar, man!

455
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,639
I need your decision.
Are you in or out?

456
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:10,541
You're gonna be happy you stayed with
Bob Sugar 'cause I am the Terminator!

457
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:15,776
I am a role model!
I have a family to support. Hear me?

458
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,683
I wanna stay in Arizona.
I want my new contract.

459
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:21,813
But I like you.
Yes, I like you, Jerry.

460
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:23,857
My wife likes you.

461
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:27,258
You're good to my wife.
I will stay with you.

462
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:29,262
That's great.
I'm very happy.

463
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,763
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

464
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:32,800
That's what I'm gonna do for you.

465
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:36,462
God bless you. But this is
what you're gonna do for me.

466
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:40,906
What can I do for you?
Just tell me.

467
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:42,909
What can I do for you?

468
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:46,208
It's a very personal,
very important thing.

469
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,214
Hell, it's a family motto.

470
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:50,079
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

471
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:52,085
Just wanna make sure you're ready.

472
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:53,848
Here it is.

473
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,614
Show me the money.

474
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:01,389
Show...

475
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,858
me...

476
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:05,523
the...

477
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,534
money!

478
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,594
Doesn't it make you feel good
just to say that?

479
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:14,573
- Say it with me one time.
- Show you the money.

480
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:18,009
You can do better than that.
Say it with meaning, brother.

481
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,775
I got Bob Sugar on the other line.
I better hear you say it.

482
00:28:20,848 --> 00:28:22,281
Show you the money.

483
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,875
Not show "you."
Show "me" the money.

484
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:27,580
- Show me the money.
- Yeah! Louder!

485
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:29,247
Show me the money.

486
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:32,087
- You got to yell that shit!
- Show me the money!

487
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,627
- I need to feel you!
- Show me the money!

488
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:36,185
You better yell!

489
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,133
- Do you love this black man?
- I love this black man!

490
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:48,107
Show me the money!

491
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:51,576
- I love black people!
- I love black people!

492
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,638
- Who's your motherfucker, Jerry?
- You're my motherfucker!

493
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:58,744
- What you gonna do?
- Show me the money!

494
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:03,046
Congratulations.
You're still my agent.

495
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,721
Well, don't worry.

496
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,449
Don't worry.

497
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:42,622
I'm not gonna do what you all think
I'm gonna do, which is just flip out.

498
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:50,794
Let me just say as I...

499
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,370
ease out of the office...

500
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:56,342
I helped build...

501
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,344
I'm sorry, but it's a fact...

502
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,072
that there is
such a thing as manners.

503
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:07,387
A way of treating people.

504
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,323
These fish have manners.

505
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:15,521
These fish have manners.

506
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:19,589
In fact, they're coming with me.
I'm starting a new company...

507
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,760
and the fish will come with me.

508
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:26,136
You can call me sentimental.

509
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:28,175
The fish, they're coming with me.

510
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:33,908
Come on. Come on.
You come on.

511
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,209
Come here. How is that?

512
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:44,318
If anybody else...

513
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,560
wants to come with me...

514
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:52,122
this moment will be the moment
of something real...

515
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:54,360
and fun and inspiring...

516
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,461
in this godforsaken business...

517
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:00,098
and we will do it together.

518
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:05,873
Who's coming with me?
Who's coming with me?

519
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:15,921
Who's coming with me besides...

520
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,423
Flipper here?

521
00:31:23,764 --> 00:31:26,062
This is embarrassing.

522
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,671
All right.

523
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:37,740
- Shall we?
- I'm...

524
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:41,446
I'm three months away
from the pay increase.

525
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,962
I will go with you.

526
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:03,927
Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

527
00:32:11,345 --> 00:32:12,744
Right now?

528
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,506
Don't do it.

529
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:26,151
Bye.

530
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:37,032
We'll see you all again.

531
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:38,765
Sleep tight.

532
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,101
Bye.

533
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:44,168
Let's see how they do without us.

534
00:32:57,424 --> 00:32:58,914
Thank you.

535
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:03,358
I know this is a bad time,
but you will have a medical program?

536
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,920
Sure, yes, medical.

537
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:09,869
I don't know what l...

538
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:13,202
When you think about
what you did there, don't panic.

539
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:16,471
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be great.

540
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,205
We're gonna be...

541
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,940
great.

542
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:22,710
Yes.

543
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:55,748
I wonder what he said.

544
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:58,478
My favorite aunt
is hearing impaired.

545
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:01,214
He just said, "You complete me."

546
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,838
We've all got a problem.

547
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:22,273
We're all stuck
in some kind of pattern.

548
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:25,403
- It's true.
- She was making an excellent point.

549
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:28,073
We have come here
to support one another...

550
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:30,946
and we don't even listen
to one another.

551
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:35,387
Women are taught not to see
each other as good people.

552
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:39,483
We see each other as the enemy.
We're competition for men.

553
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,326
It's true. We have this terrible
competition thing going on.

554
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:46,798
I really, really hated women,
and then I met you guys...

555
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,131
and you're like, you know, me.

556
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:53,731
And it's important because I know
that you can be my friends.

557
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:57,140
- What about medical?
- Of course medical.

558
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:00,578
You are a single mother. You have
given up the right to be frivolous.

559
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:03,481
If you had read what he wrote,
you would have left with him too.

560
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,484
I can always take
that job in San Diego.

561
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:07,747
Do you know how much
those Well-Child exams cost?

562
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,686
- $150.
- Yes, that's right.

563
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:11,782
And that's just when he's well.

564
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,451
Where is Ray?

565
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,654
- Asleep in the living room.
- That's wonderful.

566
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,788
The next time
you decide to lecture me...

567
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,766
don't leave my boy
with that divorced women's group.

568
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,662
So I finally got in touch
with my anger.

569
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:27,331
Yeah! You go, Alice!

570
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:35,578
- What's her problem?
- Quit her job.

571
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:37,742
My God, what did I do?

572
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,650
Function, function, function.

573
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,417
Forward motion is everything.

574
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,015
Cush saves all.

575
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:47,856
You go to Texas.

576
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:50,761
You keep one superstar,
and they'll all follow.

577
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,662
- There's no real loyalty.
- None.

578
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,998
And the first person
who told me that was you.

579
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,937
I think I was trying
to sleep with you at the time.

580
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:02,339
Well, it worked.
And I will not let you fail.

581
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:05,435
You areJerry Ma-fuckin'-guire!

582
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:08,504
- That's right.
- King of the house calls.

583
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,379
Master of the living room.

584
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,242
This is working.

585
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,515
You are not a loser.

586
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:20,186
- Who said anything about loser?
- Mistake.

587
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,127
I meant something else.
When do you want to leave?

588
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,484
- Matt?
- I'm in the back den, Jer.

589
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,958
You like a bloody beer?

590
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:01,557
- I'm fine.
- Beer and tomato juice.

591
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,395
I'm fine.

592
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:07,565
I'm here today.
We spent a lot of time together.

593
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:10,906
You know how much I care
about you and your son.

594
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:14,414
I'm quite concerned because
if you stay with SMI, your son...

595
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,574
We decided to stay with you.

596
00:37:23,757 --> 00:37:26,749
I'm not really a hugger, and yet...

597
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,455
I can't let go.

598
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,591
I told myself,
"He shows up, we stick with him."

599
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:37,396
Hey, Jerry, how's it goin'?

600
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:42,364
How are you, Cush?
How are you?

601
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:44,741
- You remember Keith?
- Keith, how you doin'?

602
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,679
I want him to go
number one in the draft...

603
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,579
and I want him to play.

604
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,279
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.
He'll go number one.

605
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:57,289
- I'll either surf or ski. I don't care.
- Denver's where he should be.

606
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:58,984
I'll give it everything.

607
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:01,960
You know I don't do contracts...

608
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,793
but what you do have is my word...

609
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:08,167
and it's stronger than oak.

610
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,673
I was so tired

611
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:18,711
Can't understand it

612
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,877
Just call me angel

613
00:38:28,322 --> 00:38:29,846
Breaking her heart

614
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:32,892
And I'm free

615
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:38,256
Free fallin'

616
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:44,531
yeah, I'm free

617
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:50,033
Free fallin'

618
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:00,918
Hello?

619
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,722
Is Avery there?

620
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,690
She had to fly to Atlanta.

621
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,751
- She had a meeting at the NFL office.
- The Playhouse rocks.

622
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:11,229
Wait. Oh, God. Sweetheart...

623
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:14,028
- Hello?
- Go sit by Chad. Sorry.

624
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,093
That was my son and the nanny.

625
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,900
- What are they all doing in our office?
- Nanny?

626
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:22,032
I prefer "child technician."

627
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,103
I had the calls transferred to my house
so I could go over some of your stuff.

628
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,740
That's fine.
Dorothy, we are back.

629
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:33,217
We are so very, very back.

630
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,448
I re-signed Cush. We're set.

631
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:37,786
I am so happy for you.

632
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:40,383
- Happy for us.
- Happy for us.

633
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,724
Okay, happy for us.

634
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:45,521
Rod, being at the draft
with me is a good idea.

635
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,036
- Just get on the plane and meet us.
- Why not?

636
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:52,936
- Good. We'll see you there.
- God bless you.

637
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:56,339
Avery will meet you at the "B" gate
at 4:15. Don't be late.

638
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,208
Do you know the human head
weighs eight pounds?

639
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:03,975
Did you know that Troy Aikman,
in only six years, has passed...

640
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,451
for 16,303 yards?

641
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,419
Do you know bees and dogs
can smell fear?

642
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,254
I put Tidwell on the same floor
at the Marriott Marquis.

643
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,887
- He doesn't smoke, does he?
- I don't know.

644
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:18,989
Did you know the career record
for most hits is 4,256...

645
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:21,967
by Pete Rose who is not
in the Hall of Fame?

646
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:24,799
Do you know that my next-door neighbor
had three rabbits?

647
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:29,308
I can't compete with that.

648
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:33,079
So did we go over everything?

649
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:34,579
- Yes?
- Yep.

650
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:36,912
- Back on Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

651
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:43,313
Ray, have a good time at school.
Wish me luck.

652
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,948
Luck!

653
00:41:05,912 --> 00:41:07,880
How're you doin', Jerry?

654
00:41:09,616 --> 00:41:11,049
Cush!

655
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:15,015
- How are you, man?
- We should really be sellin' these.

656
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:19,548
Terrific. This is my agent.
You might want to get his autograph.

657
00:41:19,626 --> 00:41:21,491
Man, my hand's getting tired.

658
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:23,051
Excuse me.

659
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,563
What's happenin'?

660
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:26,030
Are you Hootie?

661
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:29,461
No, I am not Hootie.

662
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:31,561
No, punk.

663
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,870
Is it gonna be San Diego or Denver?

664
00:41:39,379 --> 00:41:41,370
Surf or ski.

665
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:47,919
- He'll either surf or ski.
- Go to Denver!

666
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:51,686
- I'll either surf or ski.
- Right here!

667
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:58,862
At last, I find you.

668
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:02,368
What am I doing here? I feel like
I'm five years late for the prom.

669
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,530
- Come with me.
- Nobody cares about me being here.

670
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,597
We're gonna go downstairs
and walk through this lobby.

671
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:11,872
I want every media guy,
every player's rep, everybody...

672
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:14,277
to see you for what you are...

673
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:16,713
the best-kept secret in the NFL.

674
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:20,713
The most commanding
wide receiver in the game.

675
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:23,950
You are fast, fierce,
wildly charismatic.

676
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:26,959
You are the man.
You are the man. You ready?

677
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:28,927
- Let's go.
- Let's walk.

678
00:42:28,995 --> 00:42:32,226
You are the greatest, fiercest.

679
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,130
You are the man.

680
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,431
Let's do it.

681
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:38,596
- How are you?
- How's it goin'?

682
00:42:38,672 --> 00:42:40,105
- Where's Cush?
- He's upstairs.

683
00:42:40,173 --> 00:42:42,232
It's good you were able
to hang onto Cushman.

684
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,676
- Will it be San Diego or Denver?
- We'll know tomorrow. Meet Rod Tidwell.

685
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:50,149
- How're you doin', my man?
- 110 receptions, 1,550 yards last year.

686
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,549
I'd like you to meet Rod Tidwell.

687
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,143
What's up, man?

688
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,156
- 110 receptions, 1,550 yards last year.
- That's right.

689
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:11,136
Now I'm going to talk
about Rodney Tidwell who is...

690
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:13,798
the fiercest wide receiver
in the NFL.

691
00:43:24,284 --> 00:43:27,276
I came all that way
just to walk the lobby.

692
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,118
Yeah. Might have even worked too.

693
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,125
Yeah? Shit, let's do
that shit again.

694
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:37,594
They're shooting a Reebok ad.

695
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:40,656
Where are my endorsements?
You know what I'm saying?

696
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:42,759
I didn't get no love from Chevy.

697
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:45,100
I didn't get no love from Pepsi.

698
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:47,766
I didn't even get no love
from that Energizer bunny.

699
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:49,775
I ain't getting no love from Nike.

700
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:52,107
Obviously I ain't gettin'
no love from Reebok.

701
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,113
Did I ever tell you my Reebok story?

702
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:56,206
Gotta get back to Cushman.

703
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:59,480
You gotta get back
to your golden paycheck.

704
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,147
I'll boil it down for you.

705
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,883
Fuck Reebok.

706
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:06,721
All they do is ignore me.
Always have.

707
00:44:06,793 --> 00:44:08,385
Always have.

708
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:10,895
You know what was great
about you down there?

709
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:14,400
For about five minutes,
you unloaded that rather large chip...

710
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:16,901
that resides right there
on your shoulder.

711
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,835
You let people in.

712
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:22,464
You were brilliant.

713
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,772
- Brilliant?
- Brilliant.

714
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:27,871
- Really?
- Now take care. I'll see you tomorrow.

715
00:44:27,948 --> 00:44:30,508
You're loving me now, aren't you?

716
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,109
I'm not about love.
I'm about showing you the money.

717
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:35,120
I was just testing you, Jerry.

718
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:38,851
But to hear you say that
makes me love you, baby!

719
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:41,917
You know? Jerry, come back!

720
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:46,399
- How was your flight?
- Good, man. How was yours?

721
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:48,128
- How was your flight?
- Good, man. How was yours?

722
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,533
- What size are you?
- Twelve and a half.

723
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,505
Grab a couple pairs of
them new shoes by the door.

724
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:57,734
It's okay to eat fish

725
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:01,178
'Cause they haven't got

726
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:02,943
- No feelings
- Cush. Matt.

727
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:04,984
We have a decision to make.

728
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,922
San Diego just came in with
a last minute scenario. It's big.

729
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:13,858
Well, he's got to go number one.

730
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:16,327
He goes number one, but San Diego
wants to trade him up with Denver...

731
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:17,886
and they want him bad.

732
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:19,955
What happened to Denver?

733
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:22,900
This stuff tends to happen
the night before a draft.

734
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:27,235
Let me tell you something.
San Diego is crazy to the tune of...

735
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,935
seven years for 30,
signing bonus of eight.

736
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,841
Should I unplug the phone?

737
00:45:31,912 --> 00:45:33,880
Reporters.
They've been calling all night.

738
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:37,474
Just be friendly and say, "No comment."
We'll tell the world in 12 hours.

739
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:41,486
Talking and saying nothing, man...
it is an art I have not mastered.

740
00:45:41,554 --> 00:45:44,455
Well, let me do it. Wait.

741
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,255
For you, it's a pleasure.

742
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,761
This is Cush.

743
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:54,931
It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?
Just sniff if he's there.

744
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:58,869
All right, buddy. Just remember,
you're swimming with the big boys now.

745
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:02,739
Let your dad do all the talking.
I got you the deal you needed.

746
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:04,800
This is business, not friendship.

747
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:09,281
You gotta be strong 'cause
you're global now, worldwide.

748
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,010
Okay, buddy?

749
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:13,382
I'll see you later. Bye.

750
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:19,351
No comment.

751
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:29,135
- He's got it all wrong.
- It's Cush on the big TV again.

752
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:32,137
I'm sick of me already.
I've got "Cushlash."

753
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:34,298
Cushlash

754
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,717
Now, Matt, before I
go back to Denver...

755
00:46:46,786 --> 00:46:48,981
we should put something
down on paper.

756
00:46:49,055 --> 00:46:51,489
Something that says,
"I'm with Jerry Maguire."

757
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,991
Not right now.

758
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,999
Do I know everything
there is to know here?

759
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,839
You fellas aren't talking
with Bob Sugar, are you?

760
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:15,210
Apparently, Denver wanted
to deal with him instead of you.

761
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:18,913
Said who? Sugar?

762
00:47:18,985 --> 00:47:21,249
I'm learning as I go here.

763
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:25,883
So you empowered Bob Sugar
to deal with Denver behind my back?

764
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,428
I'm sorry.

765
00:47:31,064 --> 00:47:34,261
- I love my son.
- I love your son. I love your son!

766
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:38,737
I brought Denver to 20 million.
Denver deals with me all the time.

767
00:47:38,805 --> 00:47:40,295
You listened to Sugar.

768
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:44,036
Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child.

769
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,601
You let that snake in the door?

770
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:53,010
This is a rookie mistake.

771
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:56,055
You want Denver.
I'll fix this whole thing up for you.

772
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:58,556
You didn't sign anything
with Sugar, right?

773
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:06,098
Tell me you didn't sign.

774
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:09,567
Tell me you didn't sign
'cause I'm still sort of moved...

775
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,094
by your " My word
is stronger than oak" thing.

776
00:48:15,408 --> 00:48:17,638
We signed an hour ago.

777
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:23,308
You were in the lobby
with the black fella.

778
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:29,013
I'm sorry, Jerry.
I just wanna play football.

779
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:35,321
What do I do?
How do I spin this?

780
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:37,488
Honey, it's spun.

781
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:39,998
What did I do to you?

782
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:42,034
It's all about you, isn't it?

783
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:44,935
- "Soothe me, save me, love me."
- Stop moving.

784
00:48:45,004 --> 00:48:47,438
- Could you stop moving?
- I have to finish my job.

785
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,998
Everything is on
the fucking run with us.

786
00:48:50,076 --> 00:48:53,477
Jerry, you and I are salespeople.
We sell.

787
00:48:53,546 --> 00:48:55,138
It's not "Love me."

788
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:56,978
It's not "Trust my handshake."

789
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:00,816
It's "Make the sale," "Get it signed."
There shouldn't be confusion about that.

790
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:03,685
Just jump right into my nightmare.
The water is warm.

791
00:49:03,756 --> 00:49:06,850
So honesty is outlawed here?
I can't be honest?

792
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:08,450
I would prefer loyalty.

793
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,429
What was our deal
when we first got together?

794
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:13,659
Brutal truth, remember?

795
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:16,560
I think you added the "brutal."

796
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:21,234
There is a sensitivity thing
that some people have.

797
00:49:21,307 --> 00:49:24,538
I don't have it.
I don't cry at movies.

798
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:26,374
I don't gush over babies.

799
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:28,710
I don't start celebrating Christmas
five months early.

800
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:32,182
And I don't tell a man who just
screwed up both our lives, "Poor baby."

801
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,880
That's me, for better or worse.

802
00:49:36,055 --> 00:49:38,114
But I do love you.

803
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:43,494
- Avery?
- No.

804
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,554
- It's over.
- Didn't hear it.

805
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:48,624
There's something missing here,
don't you think?

806
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:50,965
- You have never been alone.
- Listen to me.

807
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:54,404
- And you can't be alone.
- It's over.

808
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,845
No one has ever dumped me.

809
00:50:02,015 --> 00:50:04,313
I'm not trying to make history here.

810
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:07,251
I did the 23-hour nose route...

811
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,483
to the top of El Capitan
in 18 hours and 23 minutes.

812
00:50:10,557 --> 00:50:12,320
I can make this work.

813
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:17,357
No.

814
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:32,067
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

815
00:50:41,921 --> 00:50:44,014
I won't let you hurt me.

816
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,684
I'm too strong for you, loser.

817
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:50,928
Fuck.

818
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:56,192
Roll with the punches.
Tomorrow's another day.

819
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:59,467
Taxi!

820
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:01,564
You lovin' me now, aren't you?

821
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,536
Very much. Taxi!

822
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:09,412
Is it my imagination,
or didn't we arrive in a limo?

823
00:51:09,482 --> 00:51:11,416
The question I have is this...

824
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:15,079
I hope this doesn't come off
too much like I'm a shrink.

825
00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:17,145
What's wrong?

826
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:20,818
- Man, I'm just a big disappointment.
- Look at this.

827
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:22,326
Can't change it.

828
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:24,090
Everybody cries on this show.

829
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:25,755
Can't change it.

830
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,426
You mad you tested positive?
Quit doing blow.

831
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,526
Upset about your baby girl?

832
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,466
Why'd you leave her mother?
I knew her. She was all right.

833
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,474
People, like the media,
don't understand...

834
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:39,511
what kind of problems and pressures
54 million come with.

835
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:43,015
- This is some bullshit.
- What are you doing with me, Rod?

836
00:51:43,082 --> 00:51:45,175
I'm still poor in life.

837
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:47,344
- What?
- Don't you even see?

838
00:51:48,521 --> 00:51:50,682
I'm finished.

839
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:52,691
I am fucked.

840
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,923
Twenty-four hours ago,
man, I was hot.

841
00:51:56,996 --> 00:51:59,021
Now...

842
00:51:59,098 --> 00:52:00,861
I'm a cautionary tale.

843
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:03,663
See this jacket I'm wearing?
You like it?

844
00:52:03,736 --> 00:52:06,796
'Cause I don't really need it
because I'm cloaked in failure!

845
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,673
I lost the number one draft pick
the night before the draft!

846
00:52:10,743 --> 00:52:12,836
Why? Let's recap.

847
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:17,679
Because a hockey player's kid
made me feel like a superficial jerk.

848
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,982
I had two slices of bad pizza,
went to bed and grew a conscience!

849
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,456
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.

850
00:52:28,594 --> 00:52:31,427
I got a shelf life
of ten years, tops.

851
00:52:31,497 --> 00:52:34,091
My next contract's
gotta bring me the dollars...

852
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,931
that'll last me and mine
a very long time.

853
00:52:37,003 --> 00:52:39,597
Shit, I'm out of this sport
in five years.

854
00:52:39,672 --> 00:52:42,106
What's my family gonna live on?

855
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:43,608
Huh?

856
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:47,578
You get me?
So I don't wanna hear your shit.

857
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:52,641
I don't wanna hear your
"Oh, I lost Cush, Avery" and shit.

858
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,586
Can I have another drink, please?

859
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:58,590
Anybody else
would've left you by now...

860
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:00,523
but I'm sticking with you.

861
00:53:00,593 --> 00:53:02,424
I said I would.

862
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:06,693
And if I got to ride your ass like
Zorro, you gonna show me the money.

863
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,859
You gonna show me the money.

864
00:53:10,036 --> 00:53:11,560
Shit.

865
00:53:11,637 --> 00:53:14,231
We together on this.
You know what I'm sayin'?

866
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:15,899
We gonna be one.

867
00:53:17,744 --> 00:53:21,145
The both of us. You know?

868
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:23,682
Oh, my God.

869
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,681
You have no messages.

870
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:58,283
- He's coming over.
- Tonight?

871
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:01,548
He just lost his best client.
I invited the guy over.

872
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:03,213
Dorothy, this is not a guy.

873
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:07,191
It's a syndrome: Early-midlife-
hangin'-on-to-the-bottom-rung...

874
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,887
dear-God-don't-let-me-be-alone...

875
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:11,862
I'll-call-my-long-suffering-assistant-
without-medical-for-company syndrome.

876
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:14,991
Lf, knowing all that, you still want him
to come over, I'm not saying a thing.

877
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:17,001
Honey, he's engaged.

878
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:21,597
For the first time in my career,
I'm part of something I believe in.

879
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:25,041
Okay. But he better
not be good-looking!

880
00:54:30,683 --> 00:54:33,015
I'm Jerry Maguire.

881
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:38,049
You are just the way
I pictured you.

882
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,025
I'm her disapproving sister,
Laurel.

883
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:45,125
Honesty. Thank you.

884
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,458
Thank you.

885
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,471
Your boss is here.

886
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:03,873
- Be careful.
- Hey, you.

887
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:07,481
- God, thanks for inviting me over.
- Sure.

888
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:11,319
Where's... Where's the little guy?

889
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,290
- He's sleeping.
- Yeah, sleeping.

890
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:17,828
I'm so glad you're home.

891
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,424
That alone thing
is not my specialty.

892
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:22,991
Oh, my God.

893
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,902
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

894
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:30,101
Well, I broke up with Avery.

895
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,345
It's just...

896
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:38,147
Gosh, you know, that's too bad.

897
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:41,015
No, it's better because...

898
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:44,523
we're still gonna be friends,
and it's better now than later.

899
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,023
Sure. Sure.

900
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:51,696
- I'm dying here, aren't I?
- Yeah, it's a really bad cut.

901
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:55,256
Well, just think if I'd got her
the ring she really wanted.

902
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,738
- Yeah.
- Why don't you have a seat?

903
00:56:05,044 --> 00:56:07,069
I'll...

904
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,637
I'll get some aloe vera
for that cut.

905
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:14,711
- Do you have something to drink?
- Sure.

906
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:22,560
- I heard.
- No kidding.

907
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:26,359
I looked over and saw the shadow of two
curious shoes in the kitchen doorway.

908
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:29,230
This guy would go home with a gardening
tool right now if it showed interest.

909
00:56:31,504 --> 00:56:34,166
Don't use those.
Use the frosted glasses.

910
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,935
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

911
00:56:36,008 --> 00:56:37,999
I warmed up some of that
chicken with salsa for you.

912
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:39,567
That's the girl I love.

913
00:56:39,645 --> 00:56:42,170
I'm not gonna say anything.
I'm just gonna say this.

914
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:45,012
You have always been
very responsible with Ray.

915
00:56:45,084 --> 00:56:48,850
It's not right for him to wake up and
hear a strange man's voice in the house.

916
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:52,084
- Some drunken stranger.
- As opposed to ten angry women?

917
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:57,860
Lean forward. Okay, I've got it.

918
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,864
Still edible.
Change your shirt.

919
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:01,524
Everything's fine.

920
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:16,048
Aren't you supposed to be in bed?

921
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:18,106
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

922
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:22,587
I won't tell.

923
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:27,058
The human head weighs eight pounds.

924
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,934
I think it's this one.

925
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,938
You should be dreamin'
about me, baby.

926
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:48,242
I should be on your mind constantly.
My agent should be thinking Rod Tidwell.

927
00:57:48,314 --> 00:57:52,580
That's when big dollars are gonna flow,
when we truly will materialize the kwan.

928
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:55,086
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

929
00:57:55,154 --> 00:57:58,123
You are speaking to the Rod Tidwell.
I need to speak with my agent.

930
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,250
I need to be my agent.
My agent and I should be one.

931
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:04,763
- Are you a football player?
- Am I a football player?

932
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,492
I'm a schoolteacher
about to whomp your ass!

933
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:09,431
PutJerry Maguire on the phone!

934
00:58:09,502 --> 00:58:11,129
I'm not saying anything else.
Just one more thing.

935
00:58:11,203 --> 00:58:13,797
You don't have the luxury of falling
for some drowning man. Be practical.

936
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:15,238
Practical?

937
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:17,502
Which top, high turtleneck sensible
or low V-neck sexy?

938
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:20,739
- Turtleneck, turtleneck. Come on.
- Don't tell me to be practical.

939
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:23,941
Do you know what other women my age
are doing right now?

940
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:28,282
They're out partying in clubs,
trying to get a man, keep a man.

941
00:58:28,354 --> 00:58:31,846
Not me, Laurel.
I'm trying to raise a man.

942
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:33,118
This one.

943
00:58:33,192 --> 00:58:37,788
I've got a 24-hour-a-day reminder
of Roger for the rest of my life.

944
00:58:37,863 --> 00:58:41,663
I've had three lovers
in four years.

945
00:58:41,734 --> 00:58:43,099
Not bad.

946
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:46,332
All of them ran a distant second
to a good book and a warm bath.

947
00:58:46,405 --> 00:58:48,464
Look at me, Laurel.

948
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:51,635
I'm the oldest 26-year-old
in the world.

949
00:58:51,711 --> 00:58:54,043
- Now, how do I look?
- Good.

950
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,104
Yeah? Thanks.

951
00:58:56,182 --> 00:58:58,343
Seventy-two percent of new buyers
are African-American.

952
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:00,647
I am African-American.
Make the connection.

953
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,119
You talk too much.

954
00:59:02,188 --> 00:59:05,055
Talking is only a primitive form
of communication!

955
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,558
Fun talking to you.
Bye, Rod.

956
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:10,657
Make a sandwich.

957
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,290
Good idea.
I just want to say one thing.

958
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:15,299
You do listen to me.

959
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:17,835
- Well, I love you. Mayo?
- Yeah.

960
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:21,031
Oppression as a religion.

961
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:23,234
My daddy worked for the United Way
for 38 years.

962
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,334
You know what he said
when he retired?

963
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:28,539
He said, " I wish they'd given me
a more comfortable chair."

964
00:59:28,614 --> 00:59:30,548
- Wait, wait.
- Thirty-eight years he sat in that.

965
00:59:30,616 --> 00:59:32,345
Then my dad died.

966
00:59:32,418 --> 00:59:36,684
My mom took me to the zoo,
and I love the zoo, but...

967
00:59:36,756 --> 00:59:38,223
No, wait, wait.

968
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,224
I want to tell you more
about my dad.

969
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,226
No, let's go to the zoo.

970
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,422
Okay.

971
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,160
No, you're right.

972
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:50,964
I don't know. It's just my whole life
I've been trying to talk.

973
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:55,439
I mean, really talk.

974
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:59,239
But no one wants to listen to me.
You know that feeling?

975
00:59:59,311 --> 01:00:01,040
They just look at you.

976
01:00:01,113 --> 01:00:03,707
Let's go right now.
Let's go to the zoo.

977
01:00:03,783 --> 01:00:05,273
Ray, the zoo, you know...

978
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,514
The fucking zoo's closed, Ray.

979
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,788
You said "fuck."

980
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,788
Yeah, I did. Is that...

981
01:00:17,863 --> 01:00:19,694
I won't tell.

982
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,631
Well.

983
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,797
Now I'm gonna have to
take you to the zoo.

984
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:30,868
I gotta go to bed.

985
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:33,741
My mom's coming.
I gotta go to bed.

986
01:00:34,814 --> 01:00:37,749
I hear my mom.
I gotta go to bed.

987
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:40,308
- Hey, thanks for listening.
- Sure.

988
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:44,412
Okay.

989
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,653
Drinks, food,
and I called you a cab.

990
01:00:49,995 --> 01:00:51,394
Good idea.

991
01:00:51,463 --> 01:00:54,057
We should keep our voices down.
I have a little boy asleep.

992
01:00:56,135 --> 01:00:57,295
Right.

993
01:00:57,369 --> 01:00:59,269
Our company.

994
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:02,106
Yeah.

995
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:04,665
Okay, okay. Look.

996
01:01:04,743 --> 01:01:07,576
A little speech before I go.

997
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:16,951
Do not worry...

998
01:01:17,022 --> 01:01:18,649
about your future.

999
01:01:18,724 --> 01:01:21,284
You and your son...

1000
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,296
We are just fine.
You still have a job.

1001
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:31,528
But let me tell you something
aboutJerry Maguire, okay?

1002
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:36,098
You come after me,
and you will lose.

1003
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:39,975
Because I am a survivor.

1004
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:41,535
I'm a survivor.

1005
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,105
Dorothy Boyd...

1006
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:47,710
you are with the lord
of the living room...

1007
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:49,515
the king...

1008
01:01:49,588 --> 01:01:53,046
of the Kingdome, and I am...

1009
01:01:57,162 --> 01:01:58,493
drunk.

1010
01:02:07,806 --> 01:02:09,740
We meet again.

1011
01:02:24,189 --> 01:02:25,315
Here.

1012
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:36,162
The truth?

1013
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:41,335
- Sure.
- I care about the job...

1014
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,341
of course...

1015
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:47,004
but mostly
I just wanna be inspired.

1016
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:49,939
Me too.

1017
01:02:50,783 --> 01:02:52,546
What you wrote inspired me.

1018
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:58,590
I'm working with you
because of that memo.

1019
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,928
I loved that memo.

1020
01:03:06,265 --> 01:03:08,199
It was a mission statement.

1021
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:24,240
Well.

1022
01:03:24,316 --> 01:03:26,250
Sorry about the hand.

1023
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:33,854
Do you know that feeling...

1024
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:35,359
you're not...

1025
01:03:36,996 --> 01:03:39,123
completely embarrassed yet,
but you glimpse...

1026
01:03:39,198 --> 01:03:41,257
tomorrow's embarrassment?

1027
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,801
Don't worry about it, boss.

1028
01:03:45,004 --> 01:03:47,404
Oh, shit. You said "boss."

1029
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:49,270
Yeah, I did.

1030
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:51,002
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

1031
01:03:51,076 --> 01:03:53,306
Don't feel like Clarence Thomas.

1032
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:55,677
I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas.

1033
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,182
I'm, like, harassing you right now.

1034
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,616
Well, I may not sue.

1035
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:14,629
Good evening.

1036
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,928
Good evening.

1037
01:04:18,737 --> 01:04:21,968
Look, don't worry, okay?
I mean, don't...

1038
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:25,165
We're gonna be okay...

1039
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:27,974
because I am gonna take
my one client...

1040
01:04:29,381 --> 01:04:32,282
and we are gonna go
all the way.

1041
01:04:33,685 --> 01:04:35,812
'Cause, hey...

1042
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:37,549
I'm back.

1043
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:41,553
Don't worry.

1044
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:47,629
Frisco! Razor! Razor!

1045
01:04:57,409 --> 01:05:00,173
Way to go, Rod.
Good catch, man. Good catch.

1046
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:05,016
All right. Good job.

1047
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,081
We gotta talk
about his contract, Dennis.

1048
01:05:10,155 --> 01:05:13,215
Meet me at the Crocodile, 8:00.

1049
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:16,492
You bet.

1050
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,277
Thank you.

1051
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:40,910
Tell me you got lost last night, because
I know you wouldn't do that to a friend.

1052
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:43,318
- Something came up.
- Well, it's okay.

1053
01:05:43,388 --> 01:05:45,447
- Ten million dollars for four years.
- It's early.

1054
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:48,789
- You're still dreaming.
- Ten for four, it's a deal.

1055
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:52,457
The guy has got
an attitude problem.

1056
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:55,125
He listens to me.
I can help you with that.

1057
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,360
He's a shrimp.

1058
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:59,802
Shrimp? Rod Tidwell broke every
receiving record you had last year.

1059
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:04,070
I want a prototypical wide receiver,
somebody who's 6'3", 220...

1060
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:07,408
not some guy who's 5'10"
and bitches in the locker room.

1061
01:06:07,479 --> 01:06:10,141
I'm asking you...

1062
01:06:12,618 --> 01:06:13,880
for a favor.

1063
01:06:13,952 --> 01:06:16,477
I introduced you to your wife.

1064
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,547
We've spent Christmases together.

1065
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,786
Holiday cheer, Dennis.

1066
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,055
Jerry, you're reaching.

1067
01:06:24,129 --> 01:06:26,324
I'm asking you for a favor!

1068
01:06:26,398 --> 01:06:28,889
Don't do this to me.
We have history, Dennis.

1069
01:06:28,967 --> 01:06:31,026
We got history, all right.

1070
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:33,936
You drove the prices up
on me for years.

1071
01:06:34,006 --> 01:06:36,770
Now it's your turn to spend some time
at the back of the line.

1072
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:39,810
Dennis, don't...

1073
01:06:43,882 --> 01:06:47,841
I started talking with Dennis Wilburn
about your renegotiation this morning.

1074
01:06:52,691 --> 01:06:54,488
Talking?

1075
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,994
Jerry Rice. Andre Reed.

1076
01:06:57,062 --> 01:06:58,586
Chris Carter.

1077
01:06:58,664 --> 01:07:01,030
- I smoke all these fools!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:04,000
Yet they are makin'
the big, sweet dollar.

1079
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:06,697
They are makin' the kwan.

1080
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:09,332
And you're talkin'.

1081
01:07:12,144 --> 01:07:14,135
Kwan? That's your word?

1082
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:16,113
Hell, yeah, that's my word.

1083
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:20,208
Some dudes might have the coin,
but they'll never have the kwan.

1084
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:21,547
What is...

1085
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,054
It means love, respect...

1086
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:27,216
community, and the dollars too...
the entire package.

1087
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:30,386
The kwan.

1088
01:07:31,463 --> 01:07:32,623
Great word.

1089
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:35,632
Towel?

1090
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:37,635
No, I air dry.

1091
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:40,197
Listen, Rod.

1092
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,708
I say this with
great respect for you...

1093
01:07:45,777 --> 01:07:48,041
but those players
you mentioned, Rod...

1094
01:07:48,113 --> 01:07:51,139
they're marquee players...

1095
01:07:51,216 --> 01:07:52,547
and this deal...

1096
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:55,246
- You know, we...
- Marquee?

1097
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,016
Here's what I'm saying.
This is a renegotiation.

1098
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,251
We want more from them,
so let's give them more.

1099
01:08:00,325 --> 01:08:02,816
Let's show them
your pure joy of the game.

1100
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:05,863
Let's bury the attitude
a little bit and show them...

1101
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:07,592
Wait.

1102
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:10,396
- You're telling me to dance.
- No.

1103
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:13,336
I'm saying
to get back to the guy...

1104
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:15,669
who first started
playing this game.

1105
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:18,471
Remember way back when,
when you were a kid?

1106
01:08:18,543 --> 01:08:20,568
It wasn't just about the money,
was it?

1107
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:24,582
Was it?

1108
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,015
Was it?

1109
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:29,045
Do your job.

1110
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:31,715
Don't you tell me to dance.

1111
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,758
Fine. Fine!

1112
01:08:33,825 --> 01:08:37,386
I am an athlete.
I am not an entertainer!

1113
01:08:37,462 --> 01:08:40,192
- Fine!
- These are the ABC's of me, baby.

1114
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:44,298
I do not dance, and I do not
start preseason without a contract.

1115
01:08:44,369 --> 01:08:46,735
Fine! Fine! Fine!

1116
01:08:46,805 --> 01:08:48,204
Jerry, talk to me.

1117
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:50,640
Breathe.

1118
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,108
Breathe, Jerry.

1119
01:08:54,379 --> 01:08:57,041
I am out here for you.

1120
01:08:57,115 --> 01:09:00,744
You don't know what it's like
to be me out here for you.

1121
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:05,256
It is an up-at-dawn,
pride-swallowing siege...

1122
01:09:05,324 --> 01:09:08,316
that I will never fully
tell you about, okay?

1123
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:13,993
Just... God, help me!

1124
01:09:15,033 --> 01:09:18,161
Help me, Rod.
Help me help you.

1125
01:09:19,338 --> 01:09:22,171
Help me help you.

1126
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:26,733
Help me help you.

1127
01:09:33,518 --> 01:09:34,951
I'm sorry.

1128
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:39,847
You are hanging on
by a very thin thread.

1129
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:43,623
I dig that about you!

1130
01:09:45,364 --> 01:09:48,026
No contract?
"Help me, help me!"

1131
01:09:49,901 --> 01:09:52,131
That's my man!

1132
01:09:52,204 --> 01:09:54,638
Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

1133
01:09:54,706 --> 01:09:57,140
Help me! Help me!

1134
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,635
I'll see you in Los Angeles.

1135
01:10:00,712 --> 01:10:03,272
Come on, man.

1136
01:10:03,348 --> 01:10:06,317
Hey, see, that's
the difference between us.

1137
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:10,287
You think we're fightin',
and I think we're finally talkin'.

1138
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:19,126
Unless you love everybody,
you can't sell anybody.

1139
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,672
Dennis Wilburn called
from Arizona to say...

1140
01:10:30,742 --> 01:10:33,404
he's faxing in the new offer
for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

1141
01:10:33,478 --> 01:10:35,878
And he said you'd be happy.
Glad.

1142
01:10:35,947 --> 01:10:38,006
Did he say "happy" or "glad"?

1143
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:42,377
Glad. He said glad. Glad.

1144
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,547
Glad is good.

1145
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:48,218
- Glad's good.
- We could sure use that commission.

1146
01:10:48,293 --> 01:10:51,524
Here, I did a rundown
on where you stand financially.

1147
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,434
I sunk most of what I had
into this condo.

1148
01:10:57,502 --> 01:11:00,960
- You don't have to explain.
- It devalued and...

1149
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:04,873
Look, the other night...
I want to apologize.

1150
01:11:04,943 --> 01:11:07,036
Yeah, what happened there?

1151
01:11:07,112 --> 01:11:10,513
We're two people working together.
We can't have atmosphere.

1152
01:11:10,582 --> 01:11:13,107
No, I'm really relieved
that you said that.

1153
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:16,677
The other night, I was lonely...

1154
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:19,189
and I felt you understood something.

1155
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:23,027
- But we've got a company to think about.
- Yes.

1156
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:26,291
I will never take advantage
of you in that way again.

1157
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:28,229
- Good.
- You walked out on a job for me.

1158
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,134
This is how I repay you?
Can this be right?

1159
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,304
Exactly.

1160
01:11:35,607 --> 01:11:39,668
This is one of those times when you need
to be alone with your thoughts...

1161
01:11:39,744 --> 01:11:42,406
and think about everything
that's gone wrong and how to fix it...

1162
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:44,745
and, you know, just be alone.

1163
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:49,076
Alone. Alone, alone, alone.

1164
01:11:50,555 --> 01:11:52,318
Alone.

1165
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:57,784
- You wanna go out to dinner?
- I know a great place.

1166
01:11:57,863 --> 01:12:00,229
The guy's an utter loser,
so I broke up with him.

1167
01:12:00,298 --> 01:12:02,562
Then he started stalking me.

1168
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:04,602
What's the current
definition of stalking?

1169
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:07,103
Coming over uninvited.

1170
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:11,165
Coming over uninvited.
So Romeo under the balcony is a stalker?

1171
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:13,768
- Exactly.
- Oh, stop!

1172
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:18,582
I love guys like that.
I would date somebody that way.

1173
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:20,584
I would too. I would date anybody,
for that matter.

1174
01:12:20,652 --> 01:12:23,177
They're always just
coming over uninvited anyway.

1175
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:26,622
Excuse me. Ladies? Ladies?

1176
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:28,682
Good evening.

1177
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,854
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

1178
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,262
She's in the kitchen.

1179
01:12:34,332 --> 01:12:36,459
- Laurel.
- Jerry. Hi.

1180
01:12:37,836 --> 01:12:39,701
So where are you taking her tonight?

1181
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,497
You're the nanny?

1182
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:45,869
- Au pair.
- Au pair, is it?

1183
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:47,468
Yeah.

1184
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:52,677
He likes you.

1185
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:57,449
My goodness.
Look, I got some gifts for you.

1186
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,383
Do you like presents?
Good. All right.

1187
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,153
Here's the Arizona Cardinals.

1188
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,629
It's the team that Rod plays for.

1189
01:13:06,698 --> 01:13:08,563
Dropping your laundry off?

1190
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:11,898
- Would you like a hat? Steelers?
- For me? Wow.

1191
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,302
Got some things.
Got it in gray too.

1192
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:16,101
Thanks, Jerry.

1193
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:19,735
You're very welcome. Oh, my goodness.
Look what I've got here.

1194
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:22,644
This is an energy bar.
This will keep you up all night.

1195
01:13:22,714 --> 01:13:25,376
See, that's not a good idea.
I'll take that, yeah.

1196
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,748
Aunt Laurel
will eat that for you.

1197
01:13:30,589 --> 01:13:32,523
Looks like you've got a fan.

1198
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:37,987
Wow.
That's more than a dress.

1199
01:13:38,063 --> 01:13:40,327
That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

1200
01:13:40,398 --> 01:13:43,925
I guess I got revved up at the idea
of an evening among adults.

1201
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:46,095
- No offense, buddy.
- Jerry, did you meet Chad?

1202
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,368
- Chad, Jerry. Jerry, Chad.
- Yeah, we did. Am I dressed okay?

1203
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:50,738
I didn't realize...

1204
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,675
Chad, don't let him
stay up too late.

1205
01:13:56,748 --> 01:14:01,549
Tonight I'm going to teach
Ray here about jazz.

1206
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,589
Good. That'll put him
to sleep early.

1207
01:14:06,157 --> 01:14:08,955
- I wanna go too.
- Oh, no, sweetheart.

1208
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,621
You stay here with Chad,
okay, and be good?

1209
01:14:11,696 --> 01:14:14,221
Give me a kiss.

1210
01:14:14,299 --> 01:14:16,631
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

1211
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:18,965
Okay. Good night.

1212
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,197
Good night.

1213
01:14:20,271 --> 01:14:21,738
Give me a hug.

1214
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:06,216
Go ahead.
I'll meet you at the car.

1215
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:09,151
- Okay.
- Just forgot the keys. No big deal.

1216
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:14,351
That is the first time I have ever
seen him kiss a man just like a dad.

1217
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,418
- Wasn't that just thrilling?
- Yeah, it was.

1218
01:15:17,495 --> 01:15:19,258
- He must really have needed that.
- Take it easy.

1219
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:22,493
Don't cry at the beginning of a date.
Cry at the end, like I do.

1220
01:15:22,567 --> 01:15:24,933
- You all right?
- Okay.

1221
01:15:25,003 --> 01:15:28,302
Don't be a shoulder for him to cry on.
That's all I'm gonna say. Nothing else.

1222
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:31,171
- Keys, keys.
- Oh, keys. Okay.

1223
01:15:32,544 --> 01:15:34,512
Oh, dear.

1224
01:15:59,804 --> 01:16:02,796
Ever since you've met me,
I've been...

1225
01:16:04,242 --> 01:16:05,675
Right?

1226
01:16:08,246 --> 01:16:11,238
It was laziness, you know...
my breakup with Avery.

1227
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:15,013
You say, "It's nobody's fault."
It's one of the great lies, right?

1228
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:17,919
Somebody is always to blame.

1229
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:20,082
You go for it like you do a job.

1230
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:22,149
Work at it.

1231
01:16:22,227 --> 01:16:26,664
But maybe love shouldn't be
such hard work.

1232
01:16:27,732 --> 01:16:29,359
Yeah, maybe so.

1233
01:16:31,002 --> 01:16:34,699
It's not every day you say good-bye
to a woman like that.

1234
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,768
A song for the lovers?

1235
01:16:39,844 --> 01:16:41,607
No, thank you.

1236
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,011
No, we work together.

1237
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:47,848
Really, guys, this is like
an office meeting, but thank you.

1238
01:16:47,919 --> 01:16:49,181
But I know what you mean.

1239
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:55,051
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger
was any good, even before...

1240
01:16:58,263 --> 01:16:59,355
Before?

1241
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:04,600
What?

1242
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:07,900
Let's not tell our sad stories.

1243
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:16,808
I'll be back
in just a second, okay?

1244
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:47,600
- I realize you're seeing someone new
- They sting.

1245
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,909
Let Chad catch the bee
in the glass.

1246
01:17:49,981 --> 01:17:52,381
No, he won't hurt him.

1247
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:55,146
You've got such a good heart, buddy.
I love you.

1248
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,916
Your temperamental, moody side

1249
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:01,288
The one you've always
tried to hide from me

1250
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,943
Well, this would be good night.

1251
01:18:27,385 --> 01:18:29,546
Good night.

1252
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:32,317
- I'll see you tomorrow. Big day.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1253
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:00,145
Well, good night.

1254
01:19:01,586 --> 01:19:03,383
Good night.

1255
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:36,547
Oops.

1256
01:19:41,025 --> 01:19:43,050
Let me fix this.

1257
01:19:43,127 --> 01:19:44,560
Good idea.

1258
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,409
I think you should not come in.

1259
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:45,786
Or come in.

1260
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,791
Depending on how you feel.

1261
01:20:52,163 --> 01:20:54,097
- Same to you.
- No.

1262
01:20:56,034 --> 01:20:58,468
I have to go in.

1263
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,571
I live here.

1264
01:21:09,514 --> 01:21:10,947
Right.

1265
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,554
I'll come in.

1266
01:21:19,257 --> 01:21:20,349
Good.

1267
01:21:30,068 --> 01:21:32,332
Are you sure we wanna do this?

1268
01:21:36,908 --> 01:21:39,172
- Oh, hell, yes.
- Yeah.

1269
01:21:48,419 --> 01:21:50,353
How is he?
Did he have a good night?

1270
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:52,355
- Yeah, he's asleep.
- Good.

1271
01:21:52,423 --> 01:21:55,415
- How'd it go with sport boy?
- Still going.

1272
01:21:57,628 --> 01:21:59,061
All right.

1273
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:06,102
How are you?

1274
01:22:09,273 --> 01:22:10,740
Treat her right.

1275
01:22:10,808 --> 01:22:13,208
- Yeah.
- She's...

1276
01:22:15,012 --> 01:22:18,243
- She's great.
- Yeah.

1277
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,218
And...

1278
01:22:21,285 --> 01:22:26,746
I know this might be a little awkward,
but I want you to use this.

1279
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:29,418
Oh, look. God, Chad.

1280
01:22:30,962 --> 01:22:34,557
This is Miles Davis...

1281
01:22:34,632 --> 01:22:35,963
and John Coltrane.

1282
01:22:36,033 --> 01:22:39,059
Stockholm, 1963.

1283
01:22:39,137 --> 01:22:42,129
Two masters of freedom
playing at a time...

1284
01:22:42,206 --> 01:22:44,140
before their art was corrupted...

1285
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:47,200
by a zillion cocktail
lounge performers...

1286
01:22:47,278 --> 01:22:52,045
who destroyed the legacy
of the only American art form...

1287
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:55,384
jazz.

1288
01:22:57,555 --> 01:23:00,080
I put some Mingus on there too.

1289
01:23:07,999 --> 01:23:10,934
No barriers, no boundaries.

1290
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:13,470
Chad, I got it.

1291
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,903
Come here.

1292
01:24:06,724 --> 01:24:09,318
You know this is
gonna change everything.

1293
01:24:13,297 --> 01:24:14,730
Promise?

1294
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:23,167
What is this music?

1295
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,776
I love getting up in the morning!

1296
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:03,746
I clap my hands and say,
"This is gonna be a great day!"

1297
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:10,511
Great. You really
needed to do this.

1298
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:25,435
I'm getting him up,
so don't worry.

1299
01:25:26,437 --> 01:25:29,668
What? I'm just waiting
for the coffee. I don't care...

1300
01:25:30,775 --> 01:25:33,437
- Just tell me one thing.
- No.

1301
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:38,113
- Why are you acting like that?
- Because I'm worried.

1302
01:25:38,182 --> 01:25:41,583
You're putting faith in this guy who,
because of the way things are going...

1303
01:25:41,652 --> 01:25:43,779
might not have
an emotional marble in his head.

1304
01:25:43,854 --> 01:25:45,879
Laurel, please,
if I start talking...

1305
01:25:45,956 --> 01:25:48,424
- You, please.
- What does that make me, Laurel...

1306
01:25:48,492 --> 01:25:50,221
for taking the opportunity?

1307
01:25:50,294 --> 01:25:53,593
Men are just different people when
they're hanging on to the bottom rung.

1308
01:25:53,664 --> 01:25:55,598
Maybe I am taking advantage.

1309
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:58,863
Does that make me
a bad person? Huh?

1310
01:25:58,936 --> 01:26:02,099
All I know is I found someone,
and he was popular and charming...

1311
01:26:02,173 --> 01:26:04,835
and not so nice to me,
and he died, okay?

1312
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:09,141
So why should I let this guy go
when everything in my body says...

1313
01:26:09,213 --> 01:26:11,875
that this one is the one.

1314
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:15,316
Take it easy, all right? I was just
looking for a few fun details.

1315
01:26:15,386 --> 01:26:18,787
Well, why didn't you say so?

1316
01:26:18,856 --> 01:26:21,950
Well, I don't know if you're interested
in this one little detail.

1317
01:26:22,026 --> 01:26:23,459
Yeah, what?

1318
01:26:23,527 --> 01:26:25,620
I was just about to tell you...

1319
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:29,365
that I love him.

1320
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:33,434
I do! I love him.

1321
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,768
I love him,
and I don't care what you think.

1322
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,968
I love him for the man
he wants to be...

1323
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:42,479
and I love him
for the man that he almost is.

1324
01:26:42,546 --> 01:26:44,571
I love him, Laurel.

1325
01:26:44,648 --> 01:26:47,947
I love him. I love him.

1326
01:26:48,018 --> 01:26:49,610
Hi, Jerry.

1327
01:26:52,022 --> 01:26:53,990
Act natural.

1328
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,764
Tell me he's not there.

1329
01:27:00,831 --> 01:27:02,799
He's not there.

1330
01:27:02,867 --> 01:27:04,835
Oh, God.

1331
01:27:04,902 --> 01:27:08,201
- Easy, ladies, easy.
- Coffee, Jerry?

1332
01:27:08,272 --> 01:27:12,470
No, thanks. We bottom feeders,
we prefer cereal first.

1333
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,802
Let's have AppleJacks.

1334
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,348
AppleJacks?
AppleJacks it is.

1335
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:23,078
Good morning, darling.

1336
01:27:25,556 --> 01:27:26,921
Morning.

1337
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,016
What's going on, Jerry?

1338
01:27:29,093 --> 01:27:32,221
A lot, actually.
We've got a big fax today.

1339
01:27:32,296 --> 01:27:33,888
We need this commission.

1340
01:27:33,964 --> 01:27:36,364
Need this commission. Milk?

1341
01:27:36,434 --> 01:27:38,368
Yeah.

1342
01:27:38,436 --> 01:27:39,596
Cheers.

1343
01:27:47,378 --> 01:27:49,369
That was really great of you
this morning.

1344
01:27:51,348 --> 01:27:53,873
Look, let's just root
for a big offer...

1345
01:27:53,951 --> 01:27:56,442
so we can move out of this room...

1346
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,353
and into a real office.

1347
01:27:59,423 --> 01:28:01,516
Would you mind? Thanks a lot.

1348
01:28:10,468 --> 01:28:11,901
Shit.

1349
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:15,238
You know, it's just...

1350
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,537
1.7 for three years?

1351
01:28:20,611 --> 01:28:22,738
- Man, we owe more than that!
- It's okay.

1352
01:28:22,813 --> 01:28:25,304
This is how the game is played.
Now I'm gonna go back to them.

1353
01:28:25,382 --> 01:28:28,408
And say what? " Please remove
your dick from my ass"?

1354
01:28:28,486 --> 01:28:31,250
- Marcee.
- I'm just a little pregnant right now.

1355
01:28:31,322 --> 01:28:32,914
That's okay.

1356
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:35,481
I feel like crying, Jerry.
I feel like bustin' the room up.

1357
01:28:35,559 --> 01:28:38,289
Rod, let's not
take this emotionally.

1358
01:28:38,362 --> 01:28:40,956
We're gonna roll
with this problem, okay?

1359
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:42,726
What are you so calm about?

1360
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,768
What do you mean,
"roll with this problem"?

1361
01:28:44,835 --> 01:28:46,598
Don't take it emotionally?

1362
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:49,696
You ask me, you haven't gotten
emotional enough over this man!

1363
01:28:49,773 --> 01:28:52,640
- I disagree.
- Somebody get Bob Sugar on the phone.

1364
01:28:55,846 --> 01:28:57,746
You wanna leave me?

1365
01:28:57,815 --> 01:29:00,943
A lot of agents say a lot of shit.
So what do you stand for?

1366
01:29:01,018 --> 01:29:03,179
- You wanna leave me?
- What do you stand for?

1367
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:06,849
How about a little piece
of integrity in this world...

1368
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:10,257
so full of greed and lack of honor
that I don't know what to tell my son...

1369
01:29:10,327 --> 01:29:14,320
except, " Here, have a look at a guy
who isn't yelling, 'Show me the money!"'

1370
01:29:14,398 --> 01:29:16,093
You know he's broke?

1371
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:20,535
He is broke and working
for you for free.

1372
01:29:21,338 --> 01:29:22,828
Broke.

1373
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:28,006
I'm sorry. I'm just not as good
at the insults as she is.

1374
01:29:28,078 --> 01:29:29,978
No, that was pretty good.

1375
01:29:30,047 --> 01:29:31,036
No shit.

1376
01:29:33,217 --> 01:29:36,277
Let me show you something.

1377
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:40,884
Here.

1378
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:42,892
Rod, read this.

1379
01:29:44,395 --> 01:29:45,657
I just think that...

1380
01:29:45,729 --> 01:29:48,493
Jerry, I think it's important.

1381
01:29:48,566 --> 01:29:51,228
That came from your heart
and you shouldn't deny it.

1382
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:55,033
You should be proud of that,
and I still think they should read it.

1383
01:29:55,105 --> 01:29:57,665
Tell me what to do.

1384
01:29:57,741 --> 01:30:00,801
You tell me to eat lima beans,
I'll eat lima beans.

1385
01:30:01,779 --> 01:30:04,577
You tell me this is the best we can get,
this is all we can get...

1386
01:30:04,648 --> 01:30:08,414
- All we can get?
- Please, I'm talking with my agent.

1387
01:30:08,485 --> 01:30:11,420
Listen, this is
what you're gonna do.

1388
01:30:11,488 --> 01:30:14,252
You're gonna reject
that shitty contract...

1389
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:18,853
and play out your existing shitty
contract and be a free agent next year.

1390
01:30:18,929 --> 01:30:20,362
Come on. Hey.

1391
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:23,525
Baby, this is us.
You and me.

1392
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:26,195
We determine our worth.

1393
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,761
Baby, you are a strong, proud...

1394
01:30:28,839 --> 01:30:31,706
surviving, splendid black man.

1395
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:39,215
You are the shit.

1396
01:30:42,953 --> 01:30:45,012
Oh, baby.

1397
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:49,523
If you get injured,
you get zero.

1398
01:30:49,593 --> 01:30:52,562
- Won't happen. I'm strong in mind.
- That's right.

1399
01:30:55,699 --> 01:30:56,893
It's a risk.

1400
01:30:57,868 --> 01:31:00,860
You bet on me
like I bet on you.

1401
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,175
You know?

1402
01:31:08,245 --> 01:31:10,577
My man! You know?

1403
01:31:11,649 --> 01:31:13,412
You know?

1404
01:31:13,484 --> 01:31:15,816
You know? Baby?

1405
01:31:17,121 --> 01:31:19,783
- Ah, you so crazy.
- I love you, baby.

1406
01:31:22,059 --> 01:31:24,254
Let me kiss that head.

1407
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,800
I'm gonna take that job
in San Diego.

1408
01:31:35,873 --> 01:31:38,671
- Don't even talk about that yet.
- You can't afford me.

1409
01:31:38,742 --> 01:31:41,734
- I'll find something.
- No, you can't afford me, Jerry.

1410
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:44,570
I'll find something fast
for Tidwell.

1411
01:31:44,648 --> 01:31:47,116
- I refuse to be a drain.
- We'll stay afloat.

1412
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:50,353
We will stay afloat.

1413
01:31:51,588 --> 01:31:53,249
Don't leave.

1414
01:31:53,323 --> 01:31:55,382
- Get on the camel!
- You've been on my ass all day.

1415
01:31:55,459 --> 01:31:58,019
I told you to put the camera low,
shoot me up from the bottom.

1416
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:00,029
- Make me look more powerful.
- Get him on the camel!

1417
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:03,157
- I'm gonna get him on the camel.
- You don't need a camel. You have me!

1418
01:32:03,233 --> 01:32:06,168
- It's Kammell Chevrolet.
- You see that? That's how I feel.

1419
01:32:07,771 --> 01:32:09,796
Do you hear him?
He's feeling my pain.

1420
01:32:09,873 --> 01:32:12,307
- Get on the camel!
- Enough. I'm pulling him from this.

1421
01:32:12,376 --> 01:32:14,310
- Pulling him?
- I'm not saying that.

1422
01:32:14,378 --> 01:32:16,312
Get rid of the camel,
and we can get busy with this.

1423
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:19,144
An athlete of your stature,
this isn't what I had in mind.

1424
01:32:19,216 --> 01:32:22,811
- You're pulling him?
- You're right. Let's bounce.

1425
01:32:22,886 --> 01:32:26,151
Pulling him? Then you shouldn't
have begged me to hire him!

1426
01:32:27,524 --> 01:32:29,515
I know you needed that commission...

1427
01:32:29,593 --> 01:32:33,552
but we ain't gonna bring Reebok to
their knees with no regional Kammell ad.

1428
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:35,564
Excuse me, darling.

1429
01:32:35,632 --> 01:32:38,396
Can I ask you a question that's
totally unrelated to your career?

1430
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:40,937
What, we gonna be friends now?

1431
01:32:41,004 --> 01:32:43,666
What do you know
about dating a single mother?

1432
01:32:43,741 --> 01:32:46,073
Plenty. I was raised
by a single mother.

1433
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:48,475
Tell me, because I think,
after this...

1434
01:32:48,545 --> 01:32:51,844
she's gonna have to
take that job in San Diego.

1435
01:32:51,915 --> 01:32:54,679
First of all,
single mothers don't date.

1436
01:32:54,752 --> 01:32:56,185
Watch it.
Watch this thing.

1437
01:32:56,253 --> 01:32:59,347
They don't date.
They've been to the circus.

1438
01:32:59,423 --> 01:33:01,186
You know what I mean?

1439
01:33:01,258 --> 01:33:04,819
They've been to the puppet show,
and they've seen the strings.

1440
01:33:04,895 --> 01:33:07,489
- Do you love her?
- How do I know?

1441
01:33:07,564 --> 01:33:10,192
What do you mean, how do you know?
You know when you know.

1442
01:33:10,267 --> 01:33:12,701
I'm feeling a little...
I don't want her to go.

1443
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:15,068
- I've been hanging out at her place.
- Wait, wait, no.

1444
01:33:15,139 --> 01:33:17,334
Right there, that's bullshit.

1445
01:33:17,407 --> 01:33:19,341
You gotta be fair to her.

1446
01:33:19,409 --> 01:33:22,105
A single mother, man,
that's a sacred thing.

1447
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,044
You gotta have the talk.

1448
01:33:25,516 --> 01:33:27,450
She loves you.

1449
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:30,078
If you don't love her,
you've got to tell her.

1450
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:35,992
The kid's amazing.

1451
01:33:36,059 --> 01:33:37,959
He...

1452
01:33:39,596 --> 01:33:42,463
I feel you. I feel you, dog.

1453
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:46,299
But a real man would not shoplift
the pootie from a single mother.

1454
01:33:48,272 --> 01:33:51,639
I didn't shoplift the pootie.

1455
01:33:56,713 --> 01:33:58,908
All right.

1456
01:33:58,982 --> 01:34:01,382
I shoplifted the pootie.

1457
01:34:09,827 --> 01:34:11,761
You know...

1458
01:34:11,829 --> 01:34:15,128
John Coltrane once said
to Miles Davis...

1459
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:17,599
When you say good-bye to him, don't
make a big, dramatic thing out of it.

1460
01:34:17,668 --> 01:34:20,899
Just be cool.
What's meant to be will be.

1461
01:34:20,971 --> 01:34:22,905
You'll still see each other.
What about me?

1462
01:34:22,973 --> 01:34:26,431
I'm losing the only person that listens
to me, and you only listen partially.

1463
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:29,001
No, quit making me laugh.
Come on.

1464
01:34:29,079 --> 01:34:31,172
You're doing the right thing.
You need to start your life.

1465
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:33,739
He needs a warm body
to cushion the fall.

1466
01:34:33,817 --> 01:34:36,115
Check out exhibit "A"
on the front lawn. Look at that.

1467
01:34:38,956 --> 01:34:41,254
I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.

1468
01:34:41,325 --> 01:34:45,489
- Good-bye.
- Yeah, good-bye.

1469
01:34:47,798 --> 01:34:49,493
Bye.

1470
01:34:56,206 --> 01:34:58,970
Listen, you're gonna like it
in San Diego, Ray.

1471
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:06,340
It's gonna be great there
because...

1472
01:35:06,416 --> 01:35:09,044
you'll make a lot of friends.

1473
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:11,815
I'm gonna see you
this weekend, you know?

1474
01:35:11,889 --> 01:35:13,823
Go ahead and go.

1475
01:35:19,496 --> 01:35:21,430
Go ahead and go.

1476
01:35:32,576 --> 01:35:34,567
Are you sure you're okay
to drive this?

1477
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:36,704
This rig? No problem.

1478
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:38,372
I'll see you this weekend.

1479
01:35:38,448 --> 01:35:42,214
Get in the car.
Get in the car, Dorothy.

1480
01:35:42,286 --> 01:35:45,084
I'll see you
in a couple of days, yeah.

1481
01:35:46,189 --> 01:35:48,214
I love you.

1482
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:51,159
I love you too, you know?

1483
01:35:51,228 --> 01:35:54,026
- What?
- Nothing.

1484
01:35:54,097 --> 01:35:56,691
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

1485
01:35:56,767 --> 01:35:58,200
Look...

1486
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:02,066
if this weekend
should turn into next month...

1487
01:36:02,139 --> 01:36:04,903
and next month should
turn into whatever...

1488
01:36:04,975 --> 01:36:06,909
don't make a joke of your life.

1489
01:36:06,977 --> 01:36:10,936
Go back and read what you wrote.
You're better than the rest of'em.

1490
01:36:11,014 --> 01:36:13,676
You're better
than the Bob Sugars.

1491
01:36:15,285 --> 01:36:16,650
Don't forget that.

1492
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:35,663
Wait. Wait a second.

1493
01:36:35,739 --> 01:36:37,604
No, no. Oh, God.

1494
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:42,436
I know a way we can save
on medical and rent.

1495
01:36:42,512 --> 01:36:44,343
No, don't listen to him.

1496
01:36:44,414 --> 01:36:47,144
What if we stayed together?

1497
01:36:47,217 --> 01:36:49,412
What if we got married?

1498
01:36:49,486 --> 01:36:51,920
If I said that, would you stay?

1499
01:36:51,989 --> 01:36:53,115
Don't do that.

1500
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:55,249
Don't say that unless...

1501
01:36:55,325 --> 01:36:58,021
Well, say it if you want to.

1502
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,434
Will you marry me?

1503
01:37:11,508 --> 01:37:12,805
What are you thinkin'?

1504
01:37:47,577 --> 01:37:49,511
We're getting married.

1505
01:37:51,248 --> 01:37:53,443
Do you, Jerry Maguire,
take this woman...

1506
01:37:53,517 --> 01:37:55,644
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1507
01:37:56,486 --> 01:37:57,919
No, not yet.

1508
01:37:57,988 --> 01:37:59,922
- And do you, Dorothy Boyd...
- Not now.

1509
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:03,084
Take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

1510
01:38:04,694 --> 01:38:05,956
Almost.

1511
01:38:06,029 --> 01:38:08,725
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1512
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:11,199
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Oh, yeah.

1513
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:21,907
Mother, mother

1514
01:38:21,978 --> 01:38:25,470
There's too many of you crying

1515
01:38:28,085 --> 01:38:30,280
Brother, brother, brother

1516
01:38:31,555 --> 01:38:34,183
Far too many of you dying

1517
01:38:36,193 --> 01:38:39,788
you know we've got to find a way

1518
01:38:40,864 --> 01:38:45,198
To bring some loving here today

1519
01:38:45,268 --> 01:38:46,360
yeah

1520
01:38:46,436 --> 01:38:48,734
Picket lines, sister

1521
01:38:48,805 --> 01:38:50,966
- And picket signs, sister
- I should go.

1522
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:54,499
Don't punish me through brutality

1523
01:38:54,578 --> 01:38:57,945
Come on, brother!
Come on and talk to me, brother!

1524
01:38:58,014 --> 01:38:59,948
'Cause you can see

1525
01:39:00,016 --> 01:39:02,814
- Oh, what's going on
- What's going on

1526
01:39:02,886 --> 01:39:05,184
- What's going on
- What's going on

1527
01:39:11,495 --> 01:39:13,429
We did it.

1528
01:39:14,898 --> 01:39:16,832
We sure did.

1529
01:39:36,086 --> 01:39:38,111
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

1530
01:39:45,228 --> 01:39:48,026
I'm glad we had this talk.

1531
01:39:49,599 --> 01:39:51,897
Oh, look at them.

1532
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:56,036
She is so beautiful.

1533
01:40:09,286 --> 01:40:13,086
Lfigure you two will have
lots of kids.

1534
01:40:13,156 --> 01:40:15,818
I do not believe
they have this on tape.

1535
01:40:17,627 --> 01:40:19,561
That's my bro.

1536
01:40:20,897 --> 01:40:22,831
Mother, mother

1537
01:40:22,899 --> 01:40:26,426
See, now, I'm gonna
release this to ESPN.

1538
01:40:28,738 --> 01:40:30,865
You think I'm joking.

1539
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:33,876
It's all right.
I know where you live.

1540
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:36,572
Far too many of you crying

1541
01:40:36,646 --> 01:40:39,342
You didn't have the talk, did you?

1542
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,112
To bring some loving

1543
01:40:45,188 --> 01:40:48,316
Well, this definitely was
another way to go.

1544
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:53,294
Hey, Dorothy, come here.

1545
01:40:53,363 --> 01:40:56,298
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. And Mrs. Maguire!

1546
01:40:57,767 --> 01:40:58,602
We're gonna have a great season!

1547
01:40:58,602 --> 01:41:00,536
We're gonna have a great season!

1548
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:11,545
Hey, Scotty.
Tidwell, 4 for 36.

1549
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,745
- He's having a good game...
- You bet he is.

1550
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:20,847
- So far.
- You're gonna miss him next year.

1551
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:27,289
Everyone's been kind to me, and I've
been fortunate enough to slip right in.

1552
01:41:27,364 --> 01:41:31,357
I've got a great team behind me,
and I'm loving it. I'm loving life.

1553
01:41:31,434 --> 01:41:32,867
Hut!

1554
01:41:38,041 --> 01:41:39,872
That's my mo-fo!

1555
01:41:41,278 --> 01:41:42,370
Come here.

1556
01:41:44,147 --> 01:41:45,876
Come here.

1557
01:41:45,949 --> 01:41:49,476
Why don't you be the first man
in your family not to use that word?

1558
01:41:49,552 --> 01:41:52,419
And then we'll let you live.
Now go kiss Daddy, quick.

1559
01:41:56,593 --> 01:41:57,719
Come on, now.

1560
01:41:58,662 --> 01:42:00,596
Come on, Rod!

1561
01:42:03,867 --> 01:42:06,199
I saw you limping a little bit
after the first quarter.

1562
01:42:06,269 --> 01:42:08,260
- What happened?
- Yeah, I dropped my...

1563
01:42:11,174 --> 01:42:13,108
I sprained my ankle on the ice
out there. It was cold.

1564
01:42:13,176 --> 01:42:15,110
It was kind of slick.
Twisted my ankle.

1565
01:42:15,445 --> 01:42:17,208
All right. Thanks.

1566
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,681
That went well.
Anybody else here worth talking to?

1567
01:42:22,285 --> 01:42:24,344
All right.
Let's get out of here.

1568
01:42:25,588 --> 01:42:27,556
- How's your head?
- Bubblicious.

1569
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:30,957
- Can you sign this?
- How are you?

1570
01:42:32,162 --> 01:42:34,323
- How are you doing, man?
- Hanging in there.

1571
01:42:34,397 --> 01:42:36,331
- Good game.
- Tough one out there.

1572
01:42:38,635 --> 01:42:41,331
- Quarterback sucks, man.
- Thanks, man.

1573
01:42:41,404 --> 01:42:45,670
Gonna get me killed. He was throwing
high and across the middle.

1574
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:47,937
I'm worried.
I'm worried the only reason why...

1575
01:42:48,011 --> 01:42:50,377
I'm getting my brains blown loose
is 'cause you weren't asshole enough...

1576
01:42:50,447 --> 01:42:52,881
to get me my ten million
three fucking months ago.

1577
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,083
Shit.

1578
01:42:56,553 --> 01:42:58,987
You take care of yourself
out on that field, you hear?

1579
01:42:59,055 --> 01:43:02,422
- You're my entire client roster.
- Don't I know this.

1580
01:43:03,393 --> 01:43:05,520
Now go home to your wife.

1581
01:43:05,595 --> 01:43:08,530
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you doing here?

1582
01:43:08,598 --> 01:43:10,532
You could've told me this shit
over the phone.

1583
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,364
How about dedication for an answer?
How about personal attention?

1584
01:43:13,436 --> 01:43:15,768
You don't want to go home, do you?

1585
01:43:15,839 --> 01:43:19,002
- What are you saying?
- I'm just trying to talk to you.

1586
01:43:19,075 --> 01:43:20,633
How's your marriage?

1587
01:43:21,644 --> 01:43:24,078
You know, the husband and wife thing?
How is that?

1588
01:43:32,055 --> 01:43:34,853
Not everyone has what you have.

1589
01:43:34,924 --> 01:43:37,654
Then why did you get married?

1590
01:43:37,727 --> 01:43:40,821
- I'm just asking as a friend.
- You want an answer?

1591
01:43:41,898 --> 01:43:43,456
Loyalty.

1592
01:43:44,534 --> 01:43:46,195
She was loyal.

1593
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:53,436
I mean, you know, everything...

1594
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:55,501
grew from there.

1595
01:43:55,578 --> 01:43:57,637
It just...

1596
01:43:58,581 --> 01:44:00,515
grew from there.

1597
01:44:01,451 --> 01:44:03,646
That's an answer.

1598
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,654
That's the answer.

1599
01:44:05,722 --> 01:44:07,883
It's not sexy.

1600
01:44:07,957 --> 01:44:10,585
Shit. That's an answer.

1601
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,594
Tell him what he's won, Bob!

1602
01:44:12,662 --> 01:44:14,755
A beautiful marriage!

1603
01:44:15,832 --> 01:44:17,595
Shit!

1604
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:19,430
Well...

1605
01:44:19,502 --> 01:44:22,027
I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, Rod.

1606
01:44:24,174 --> 01:44:25,698
Shit.

1607
01:44:25,775 --> 01:44:28,437
I have a question for you, Rod.

1608
01:44:28,511 --> 01:44:30,445
- Are we really friends?
- Why not?

1609
01:44:30,513 --> 01:44:33,243
Because friends can tell
each other anything...

1610
01:44:33,316 --> 01:44:35,250
if we have our
"friends hats" on, right?

1611
01:44:35,318 --> 01:44:37,252
- Yeah, I think so.
- All right.

1612
01:44:38,655 --> 01:44:40,987
I'll tell you why you don't
have your $10 million yet.

1613
01:44:41,825 --> 01:44:44,658
Right now, you are a paycheck player.

1614
01:44:44,727 --> 01:44:46,888
You play with your head,
not your heart.

1615
01:44:46,963 --> 01:44:49,363
In your personal life, heart.

1616
01:44:49,432 --> 01:44:52,833
But when you get on the field,
it's all about what you didn't get...

1617
01:44:52,902 --> 01:44:55,564
who's to blame,
who under-threw the pass...

1618
01:44:55,638 --> 01:44:58,698
who's got the contract you don't,
who's not giving you your love.

1619
01:44:58,775 --> 01:45:02,768
You know what?
That is not what inspires people.

1620
01:45:02,846 --> 01:45:05,212
That is not what inspires people.

1621
01:45:05,281 --> 01:45:08,546
Just shut up. Play the game.
Play it from your heart.

1622
01:45:08,618 --> 01:45:11,678
And you know what?
I will show you the kwan.

1623
01:45:11,754 --> 01:45:15,121
And that's the truth, man.
That's the truth. Can you handle it?

1624
01:45:15,191 --> 01:45:18,024
It's just a question between friends.
You know?

1625
01:45:21,364 --> 01:45:24,697
And when they call you shrimp,
I'm the one who defends you!

1626
01:45:25,435 --> 01:45:27,665
- I don't want to be friends no more.
- Fine.

1627
01:45:27,737 --> 01:45:30,900
And quit using that word "kwan."
That's my word!

1628
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:33,632
- I'll see you in L.A.
- No heart.

1629
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:35,405
No heart?

1630
01:45:35,478 --> 01:45:37,469
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

1631
01:46:16,052 --> 01:46:17,644
How many concussions has he had?

1632
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:20,917
I don't get no respect.
This is bullshit.

1633
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,117
You know what I'm saying?
I'm making miracles happen.

1634
01:46:41,477 --> 01:46:45,777
You guys, I go to see this so-called
black film the other day.

1635
01:46:45,848 --> 01:46:48,009
Honey, no more salt for you.

1636
01:46:48,084 --> 01:46:50,018
The biggest game
of the season's coming up.

1637
01:46:50,086 --> 01:46:53,021
I don't want you dehydrated
for Monday Night Football.

1638
01:46:54,591 --> 01:46:58,687
Anyway, 20 minutes
of coming attractions.

1639
01:46:58,761 --> 01:47:00,888
All black films, all violent.

1640
01:47:00,964 --> 01:47:03,296
I'm talking about
brothers shooting brothers.

1641
01:47:03,366 --> 01:47:05,926
I hate you going to the movies
alone without me.

1642
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:08,402
Oh, baby.

1643
01:47:08,471 --> 01:47:11,201
- My Pisces queen.
- Oh, baby.

1644
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:15,839
I hate seeing movies without you.

1645
01:47:18,748 --> 01:47:21,444
I won't do it anymore, okay?

1646
01:47:21,517 --> 01:47:23,451
I promise.

1647
01:47:26,322 --> 01:47:29,485
Another one. Chi-Chi-Bear.

1648
01:47:30,727 --> 01:47:32,854
- Baby.
- Baby.

1649
01:47:32,929 --> 01:47:36,387
- Oh, baby. Baby.
- Oh, baby. Oh! Baby!

1650
01:47:36,466 --> 01:47:39,230
- Now?
- Oh, baby, baby now! Baby now!

1651
01:47:39,302 --> 01:47:42,362
- Baby?
- Ray, it's time to go!

1652
01:47:42,438 --> 01:47:44,872
- Baby. Come on.
- You got them?

1653
01:47:44,941 --> 01:47:47,910
Hey, you take Visa? Take it!

1654
01:47:49,379 --> 01:47:51,347
What were you thinking tonight...

1655
01:47:51,414 --> 01:47:53,507
watching them go through...

1656
01:47:53,583 --> 01:47:56,848
the entire human emotional experience?

1657
01:47:56,919 --> 01:47:59,888
I was thinking,
"I hope he doesn't get injured."

1658
01:48:02,191 --> 01:48:03,852
I felt responsible.

1659
01:48:05,561 --> 01:48:10,225
Sometimes I can't tell at all
what's going on in that head of yours.

1660
01:48:15,672 --> 01:48:18,539
And I really don't know
your noises yet.

1661
01:48:20,343 --> 01:48:22,811
Well, when you wonder, ask me.

1662
01:48:22,879 --> 01:48:25,439
Okay, I will.

1663
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:29,277
I thought I just did.

1664
01:48:34,557 --> 01:48:37,424
- Why do you love me?
- Why do you love me?

1665
01:48:38,628 --> 01:48:40,562
Can I come in and watch TV?

1666
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:42,598
- In a minute.
- Just for a few minutes.

1667
01:49:03,152 --> 01:49:05,086
Hang in there.
He's not going anywhere.

1668
01:49:05,154 --> 01:49:07,645
I know.

1669
01:49:07,724 --> 01:49:10,488
Could we talk about something else?

1670
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:14,087
I don't think so.
I'm incapable of small talk.

1671
01:49:14,163 --> 01:49:16,495
But that's why you love me, right?

1672
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:32,511
I want you to know
I'm about personal attention.

1673
01:49:32,582 --> 01:49:36,484
This is my life.
I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

1674
01:49:36,552 --> 01:49:38,486
I'm in my office.
Call me anytime.

1675
01:49:38,554 --> 01:49:40,784
I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow
for Monday Night Football.

1676
01:49:40,857 --> 01:49:44,657
I can be in Indiana
by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

1677
01:49:44,727 --> 01:49:47,161
Just give me 20 minutes.

1678
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:49,130
I'm not asking for an answer now.

1679
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:51,223
Why don't you...
I'll call you tomorrow.

1680
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,701
Just enjoy the rest of your day.
Tell Douglas I said hello, would you?

1681
01:49:54,771 --> 01:49:58,502
All right. Thank you.
Same to you, Marilee. Bye-bye.

1682
01:50:01,778 --> 01:50:05,009
Indiana, Tuesday. I'll be there.

1683
01:50:09,418 --> 01:50:11,010
It's my fault.

1684
01:50:13,489 --> 01:50:14,922
What?

1685
01:50:14,991 --> 01:50:18,051
It's not fair to you,
this whole thing.

1686
01:50:21,697 --> 01:50:23,130
Here.

1687
01:50:24,233 --> 01:50:27,396
Tell me. Let me help.

1688
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:29,404
I took advantage of you.

1689
01:50:29,472 --> 01:50:33,340
The worst of it is that I'm not alone.
I did this with a kid.

1690
01:50:34,544 --> 01:50:38,241
I was just on some wild ride...

1691
01:50:38,314 --> 01:50:42,011
where I thought that
I was in love enough...

1692
01:50:42,084 --> 01:50:44,177
for both of us.

1693
01:50:45,721 --> 01:50:48,656
I pretended that proposal
by the car was real...

1694
01:50:48,724 --> 01:50:50,851
and it might've just been
a hypothetical.

1695
01:50:54,497 --> 01:50:56,863
I did this...

1696
01:50:56,933 --> 01:50:59,868
and at least I can do
something about it now.

1697
01:51:00,937 --> 01:51:04,100
I'm not a guy who runs.

1698
01:51:04,173 --> 01:51:06,107
I stick.

1699
01:51:08,077 --> 01:51:10,272
Well, I don't need you to stick.

1700
01:51:11,514 --> 01:51:13,277
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

1701
01:51:13,349 --> 01:51:17,308
- My soul or something?
- Why not? I deserve that.

1702
01:51:18,955 --> 01:51:20,946
What if I'm not built that way?

1703
01:51:22,859 --> 01:51:26,625
- I think we made a mistake.
- No, listen. What if it's true?

1704
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:31,932
Great at friendship, bad at intimacy.

1705
01:51:32,001 --> 01:51:36,836
I mean, come on, it's the theme
of my bachelor film, for God's sake.

1706
01:51:36,906 --> 01:51:39,602
I know. I watched it.

1707
01:51:39,675 --> 01:51:41,734
I sort of know it by heart.

1708
01:51:45,147 --> 01:51:47,342
I don't like to give up.

1709
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:50,078
Please, Jerry.

1710
01:51:50,152 --> 01:51:55,146
My need to make the best of things
and your need to be responsible.

1711
01:51:55,224 --> 01:51:57,658
If one of us doesn't say
something about it now...

1712
01:51:57,727 --> 01:52:01,458
we could lose ten years being polite.

1713
01:52:04,267 --> 01:52:08,294
Let's just call this next road trip
what it really is...

1714
01:52:10,072 --> 01:52:11,664
a nice, long break.

1715
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:23,009
What about Ray?

1716
01:52:26,555 --> 01:52:28,489
Well, you'll be friends.

1717
01:52:30,393 --> 01:52:32,987
- Friends?
- Friends.

1718
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:38,333
Of course you'll be friends.

1719
01:52:38,401 --> 01:52:40,961
I'll take him to the zoo.

1720
01:52:45,174 --> 01:52:48,337
So this break is a breakup.

1721
01:52:48,411 --> 01:52:52,211
Come on, Jerry.
You know this isn't easy for me.

1722
01:52:53,749 --> 01:52:56,274
On the surface everything looks fine.

1723
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:59,679
I've got this great guy...

1724
01:53:01,424 --> 01:53:04,120
and he loves my kid...

1725
01:53:06,696 --> 01:53:09,927
and he sure does like me a lot.

1726
01:53:16,138 --> 01:53:18,834
And I can't live like that.

1727
01:53:22,111 --> 01:53:25,012
It's not how I'm built.

1728
01:53:57,046 --> 01:53:59,913
If this is empty...

1729
01:53:59,982 --> 01:54:01,916
this doesn't matter.

1730
01:54:23,973 --> 01:54:25,907
It was just a mission statement.

1731
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:44,726
Put your arms out. Let's see.

1732
01:54:44,794 --> 01:54:47,456
All right.
Let's see what you've got here.

1733
01:54:59,075 --> 01:55:01,134
Hey, Rod, buddy, dude.

1734
01:55:01,210 --> 01:55:03,041
I was wondering where you were.
How's it going?

1735
01:55:03,112 --> 01:55:05,945
Get out of here. Go.

1736
01:55:07,883 --> 01:55:11,614
- Where's your agent?
- I don't know.

1737
01:55:11,687 --> 01:55:15,555
I know this is uncool to do this now,
but you belong with the big boys.

1738
01:55:15,624 --> 01:55:18,559
You belong with the big money.
You're fucking Rod Tidwell.

1739
01:55:18,627 --> 01:55:20,561
Get away from my guy.

1740
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:24,030
- Hey, Jerry, I was just hailing you.
- Just go. Flee.

1741
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:28,128
This is a nice moment for you.

1742
01:55:28,204 --> 01:55:30,138
I'm gonna let you have it.

1743
01:55:32,074 --> 01:55:34,508
Give me a call, Rod.
Say hi to Marcee for me.

1744
01:55:42,785 --> 01:55:45,811
- Thanks for coming.
- I missed you.

1745
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:50,258
What can I say?

1746
01:55:50,326 --> 01:55:52,317
You're all I've got.

1747
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:57,294
Hello again, everyone. Frank Gifford
with Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf.

1748
01:55:57,366 --> 01:56:00,062
Welcome to Tempe, Arizona's
Sun Devil Stadium...

1749
01:56:00,136 --> 01:56:02,627
where the story tonight
is the Arizona Cardinals.

1750
01:56:02,705 --> 01:56:04,696
They are still alive
for a play-off spot.

1751
01:56:04,773 --> 01:56:07,071
The reason the Cardinals are alive
is the outstanding play...

1752
01:56:07,143 --> 01:56:09,907
the surprising play of Rod Tidwell.

1753
01:56:09,979 --> 01:56:11,913
- We'll talk about that too.
- That's my daddy!

1754
01:56:11,981 --> 01:56:13,744
Meanwhile, the Dallas Cowboys
continue to roll.

1755
01:56:13,816 --> 01:56:15,750
They know they're in the play-offs...

1756
01:56:15,818 --> 01:56:18,013
and going in looking for
a second consecutive Super Bowl.

1757
01:56:18,087 --> 01:56:20,180
Who could've believed this?
Here's the deal.

1758
01:56:20,256 --> 01:56:22,724
If Arizona wins tonight
and next week...

1759
01:56:22,791 --> 01:56:25,123
amazingly the Cardinals
will make the play-offs...

1760
01:56:25,194 --> 01:56:27,890
for the first time in 21 years.

1761
01:56:28,964 --> 01:56:32,730
Better not mess up
for Monday Night Football.

1762
01:56:32,801 --> 01:56:34,632
What'd I say?

1763
01:56:34,703 --> 01:56:37,536
Everybody knows he gets nervous
for nationally televised games.

1764
01:56:37,606 --> 01:56:40,803
The Cowboys continue their Super Bowl
mission on Monday Night Football...

1765
01:56:40,876 --> 01:56:42,537
a Christmas edition.

1766
01:56:49,952 --> 01:56:51,886
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi, Jerry. Good game.

1767
01:56:51,954 --> 01:56:54,184
Yeah. Hey, great column
this morning.

1768
01:56:54,256 --> 01:56:55,689
Thanks.

1769
01:57:00,963 --> 01:57:02,487
Fuck you, punk!

1770
01:57:09,738 --> 01:57:12,172
Boy, guys, it's a real bruiser
out there tonight.

1771
01:57:12,241 --> 01:57:16,644
Frank, the Cardinals just refuse
to go quietly into the desert night...

1772
01:57:16,712 --> 01:57:19,681
as their seemingly
interminable season winds down.

1773
01:57:19,748 --> 01:57:21,511
Come on, guys. I'm trying
to be a little poetic here.

1774
01:57:21,584 --> 01:57:23,518
Wax on, Al. Wax on.

1775
01:57:24,653 --> 01:57:25,813
Ouch!

1776
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:29,619
Oh, a tough hit on Rod Tidwell.
Nothing poetic about that.

1777
01:57:29,692 --> 01:57:32,456
I would've taken it for the touchdown
all the way, baby.

1778
01:57:32,528 --> 01:57:35,429
That's his sixth catch of the night.
Split to the right.

1779
01:57:35,497 --> 01:57:37,465
Swenson looks that way, hits him...

1780
01:57:37,533 --> 01:57:40,195
and it's enough for a first down
at the 19-yard line.

1781
01:57:40,269 --> 01:57:44,000
Another savage hit across
the middle on Rod Tidwell.

1782
01:57:44,073 --> 01:57:46,507
He took some shot, didn't he?

1783
01:57:46,575 --> 01:57:47,872
They are working Tidwell, aren't they?

1784
01:57:47,943 --> 01:57:50,468
- Hey, what does Daddy always say?
- Nice job by Swenson.

1785
01:57:50,546 --> 01:57:54,277
- "It looks worse than it really is."
- That's right.

1786
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:56,978
He ain't gonna have nothing left
for next season. He'll kill himself!

1787
01:57:57,052 --> 01:57:59,145
- Can you be quiet?
- What'd I say?

1788
01:57:59,221 --> 01:58:02,782
Less than two minutes to play.
Dallas leading by three.

1789
01:58:02,858 --> 01:58:07,386
Second down and one now
at the Dallas 11-yard line.

1790
01:58:07,463 --> 01:58:09,863
- Hut!
- Swenson back to pass.

1791
01:58:09,932 --> 01:58:13,629
A blitz! And down he goes!
He's sacked for a six-yard loss.

1792
01:58:13,702 --> 01:58:16,865
Good move coming with the blitz,
getting after Swenson.

1793
01:58:16,939 --> 01:58:19,203
Swenson's limping back.
He had too many men in that pattern.

1794
01:58:19,275 --> 01:58:22,642
They just did not have enough
to pick up the blitz.

1795
01:58:22,711 --> 01:58:24,645
- Listen up. Listen up.
- Shut up!

1796
01:58:24,713 --> 01:58:27,705
Ninety razor,
X out, on one. Ready?

1797
01:58:27,783 --> 01:58:28,841
Break!

1798
01:58:28,917 --> 01:58:31,078
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1799
01:58:31,153 --> 01:58:34,247
He had a chance to get rid of it,
but he had to tuck it away.

1800
01:58:34,323 --> 01:58:37,918
From second and one,
they've now gone to third and seven.

1801
01:58:37,993 --> 01:58:41,861
In the waning moments of this game,
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.

1802
01:58:41,930 --> 01:58:43,022
Set!

1803
01:58:43,098 --> 01:58:45,396
- Tidwell in motion...
- Come on, Cards!

1804
01:58:45,467 --> 01:58:47,458
Moving back to his left now.

1805
01:58:47,536 --> 01:58:52,496
Play fake. Swenson protected well,
lofts one to the end zone!

1806
01:58:52,574 --> 01:58:54,542
- Yes!
- Touchdown Cardinals!

1807
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:57,010
What a great effort!
Did you see him go up on that ball?

1808
01:58:57,079 --> 01:59:00,640
He held on to the football.
He's still down on the ground.

1809
01:59:00,716 --> 01:59:04,015
But Rod Tidwell, upside-down,
hits the ground hard...

1810
01:59:04,086 --> 01:59:05,781
and manages to maintain control
of the football.

1811
01:59:05,854 --> 01:59:08,789
Oh, yeah, he's hurt too.
Oh, yeah.

1812
01:59:08,857 --> 01:59:10,552
He's not getting up.

1813
01:59:10,626 --> 01:59:13,527
Boy, look at the faces
of these Cardinal players now...

1814
01:59:13,595 --> 01:59:15,688
- as elation turns into concern...
- Oh, my God. Get up, baby.

1815
01:59:15,764 --> 01:59:19,131
- For their fallen teammate.
- Cardinal trainer goes to the field...

1816
01:59:19,201 --> 01:59:21,601
- as Tidwell makes his ninth catch...
- Oh, my God.

1817
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:23,604
And gives Arizona the lead.

1818
01:59:31,847 --> 01:59:34,645
Can you hear me? Blink, baby.

1819
01:59:34,717 --> 01:59:36,309
Come on, blink!

1820
01:59:42,458 --> 01:59:45,427
- We'll come back to...
- Why are they going to a commercial?

1821
01:59:45,494 --> 01:59:47,394
Tell me what's wrong with my husband.

1822
01:59:47,463 --> 01:59:49,397
See, I told you he was
too small for the NFL.

1823
01:59:49,465 --> 01:59:52,059
- Shut up!
- I just got a commitment to the truth.

1824
01:59:52,134 --> 01:59:54,068
I'm not putting him down.
I'm keeping it real.

1825
01:59:54,136 --> 01:59:58,470
Tee Pee, shut up! Can't you be loyal
to your brother that loves you?

1826
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:01,373
Get the hell outta my house.
Get out of my house!

1827
02:00:01,443 --> 02:00:03,240
- Get out of my house, Tee Pee!
- Hello?

1828
02:00:03,312 --> 02:00:05,439
Hold on. It's Jerry Maguire.

1829
02:00:06,415 --> 02:00:07,848
Punk!

1830
02:00:10,886 --> 02:00:13,480
Oh, my God, Jerry, I am freaking out.

1831
02:00:13,555 --> 02:00:16,285
Marcee, he's unconscious.

1832
02:00:16,358 --> 02:00:19,657
No, I know. Just stay calm.
Keep the phone lines open.

1833
02:00:19,728 --> 02:00:22,390
I will call you back.
There's good doctors on the field.

1834
02:00:22,464 --> 02:00:23,988
Just stay calm.

1835
02:00:24,066 --> 02:00:28,059
No, you have to tell me something.
I cannot stay calm. I am freaking here.

1836
02:00:28,137 --> 02:00:31,937
Please. You gotta stay calm.
Your family needs you to stay calm.

1837
02:00:32,007 --> 02:00:34,032
I know. I know.

1838
02:00:34,109 --> 02:00:37,237
But my whole life is this family...

1839
02:00:37,312 --> 02:00:39,872
and it does not work without him!

1840
02:00:39,948 --> 02:00:42,883
And right now, as we look at it
from another angle...

1841
02:00:42,951 --> 02:00:44,919
all eyes here
at Sun Devil Stadium...

1842
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:47,455
Jerry, I am so sorry.

1843
02:00:47,523 --> 02:00:49,753
Everything that I said about your job.

1844
02:00:49,825 --> 02:00:53,784
Just do whatever you can
to get Rod to me, please.

1845
02:00:53,862 --> 02:00:56,490
Just do whatever you can.

1846
02:00:56,565 --> 02:00:58,157
Please, Jerry.

1847
02:00:58,233 --> 02:01:00,201
I'll tell you,
at a time like this...

1848
02:01:00,269 --> 02:01:03,670
you just hope that his family
is not watching this.

1849
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:07,300
Check his neck. It could be his neck.
It could be his back.

1850
02:01:11,947 --> 02:01:15,178
Blink, baby! Come on, wake up!

1851
02:01:17,052 --> 02:01:19,486
We love you, Rod!

1852
02:01:29,131 --> 02:01:31,497
Rod, can you hear me?

1853
02:01:31,567 --> 02:01:33,558
Can you hear me?

1854
02:01:33,635 --> 02:01:35,569
Do you know where you are, Rod?

1855
02:01:36,538 --> 02:01:39,439
You can see the trainer
still trying to revive Rod Tidwell.

1856
02:01:39,508 --> 02:01:40,907
You'd love to see some movement.

1857
02:01:42,511 --> 02:01:44,911
Let's get him off the field.
Get the gurney.

1858
02:01:46,415 --> 02:01:48,815
Get the gurney.
Let's get him off the field now.

1859
02:01:48,884 --> 02:01:50,818
No, wait, wait, wait.

1860
02:01:50,886 --> 02:01:53,753
Just let me enjoy this for a minute.

1861
02:01:53,822 --> 02:01:57,121
You're looking for any type
of movement out of Rod Tidwell.

1862
02:01:57,192 --> 02:02:00,525
- Is that his head coming up I see?
- He's gonna try to get up.

1863
02:02:02,698 --> 02:02:04,359
And he is getting up!

1864
02:02:12,808 --> 02:02:16,039
Oh, my God! Look at him.
Mommy, he's okay!

1865
02:02:18,046 --> 02:02:19,536
Oh, my God!

1866
02:02:19,615 --> 02:02:22,914
- Help me.
- Everybody's standing in the stadium.

1867
02:02:22,985 --> 02:02:25,613
He's up on his feet,
and the crowd loves it.

1868
02:02:54,082 --> 02:02:57,518
Here's a guy who most of the season has
been very truculent with the media...

1869
02:02:57,586 --> 02:02:59,986
has been standoffish.

1870
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:17,200
Rod, we're happy for you, buddy.

1871
02:03:17,272 --> 02:03:20,639
He's gonna get a flag on this,
but who cares?

1872
02:03:31,153 --> 02:03:33,087
You know!

1873
02:03:34,590 --> 02:03:35,852
You know!

1874
02:03:35,924 --> 02:03:38,484
- Congratulations, Jerry.
- Thank you. Hell of a game.

1875
02:03:40,128 --> 02:03:42,062
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1876
02:03:43,432 --> 02:03:44,865
Bye.

1877
02:03:52,574 --> 02:03:54,701
I know. I know.

1878
02:04:00,782 --> 02:04:02,044
It's Tidwell!

1879
02:04:09,057 --> 02:04:11,252
Hey, Tidwell, can you believe
you're in the play-offs?

1880
02:04:15,063 --> 02:04:16,997
Where's Jerry?

1881
02:04:22,204 --> 02:04:24,138
Over here, Rod!

1882
02:04:37,252 --> 02:04:39,277
We did it.

1883
02:04:39,354 --> 02:04:41,652
You did it.

1884
02:04:43,025 --> 02:04:45,391
Why don't we have
that kind of relationship?

1885
02:04:54,670 --> 02:04:56,570
Is that your porty or mine?

1886
02:05:04,413 --> 02:05:07,905
No, no, no. He's right here.
He's right here. It's Marcee.

1887
02:05:07,983 --> 02:05:09,917
She couldn't get through
on your phone.

1888
02:05:12,621 --> 02:05:14,919
We did it!

1889
02:05:14,990 --> 02:05:17,220
I love you!
I love you so much!

1890
02:05:19,728 --> 02:05:21,161
Yeah.

1891
02:05:21,229 --> 02:05:23,163
I love you!

1892
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:30,604
I love you, Tyson.

1893
02:05:30,672 --> 02:05:34,472
I love you, baby.
How's the baby? How's Kaydee?

1894
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:38,135
Oh, I love you so much.

1895
02:05:39,881 --> 02:05:42,816
No, I'm okay. You know there ain't
nothing gonna happen to me.

1896
02:05:51,393 --> 02:05:53,224
I think the problem is...

1897
02:05:53,295 --> 02:05:56,628
Alice, you were saying earlier,
something about the biorhythms or...

1898
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:01,263
I was saying that
the neural pathways are set...

1899
02:06:01,336 --> 02:06:03,327
and that's why it's hard
for people to change.

1900
02:06:03,405 --> 02:06:06,203
That's why behavior
doesn't change very often.

1901
02:06:08,777 --> 02:06:10,870
- Rochelle, what's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

1902
02:06:10,946 --> 02:06:14,541
These stupid holidays are
making me feel more divorced.

1903
02:06:14,616 --> 02:06:16,550
- You know?
- Absolutely.

1904
02:06:16,618 --> 02:06:19,712
I mean, with the songs
and the constant chocolate-eating...

1905
02:06:35,604 --> 02:06:37,765
You know what?
I have a confession to make.

1906
02:06:39,141 --> 02:06:43,168
I've listened to you all
tell a thousand sob stories...

1907
02:06:43,245 --> 02:06:46,681
and, well, I've been very judgmental.

1908
02:06:46,748 --> 02:06:50,809
Maybe you're all correct.
Men are the enemy.

1909
02:06:50,886 --> 02:06:53,354
- Thank you.
- No, they're not the enemy.

1910
02:06:53,421 --> 02:06:58,085
But I still love the enemy.

1911
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:00,355
Well, there you go
contradicting yourself.

1912
02:07:00,428 --> 02:07:03,920
- She doesn't even make sense.
- Come on. It's Christmas.

1913
02:07:03,999 --> 02:07:06,194
I mean, I've had it up to here!

1914
02:07:06,268 --> 02:07:09,396
The men I know are the enemy.

1915
02:07:09,471 --> 02:07:12,440
I'm not gonna say
the entire group of...

1916
02:07:12,507 --> 02:07:14,441
Hello. Hello.

1917
02:07:15,944 --> 02:07:17,878
I'm looking for my wife.

1918
02:07:31,026 --> 02:07:32,220
Wait.

1919
02:07:42,571 --> 02:07:46,564
If this is where it has to happen,
then this is where it has to happen.

1920
02:07:48,243 --> 02:07:52,202
I'm not letting you get rid of me.
How about that?

1921
02:07:58,753 --> 02:08:01,244
This used to be my specialty.
I was good in the living room.

1922
02:08:01,323 --> 02:08:04,724
They'd send me in there,
I'd do it alone.

1923
02:08:05,527 --> 02:08:07,461
And now, I just...

1924
02:08:21,142 --> 02:08:23,201
But tonight...

1925
02:08:23,278 --> 02:08:25,644
our little project, our company...

1926
02:08:26,514 --> 02:08:29,039
had a very big night...

1927
02:08:29,117 --> 02:08:32,518
a very, very big night.

1928
02:08:36,124 --> 02:08:38,820
But it wasn't complete.

1929
02:08:40,862 --> 02:08:43,057
It wasn't nearly close...

1930
02:08:43,131 --> 02:08:46,828
to being in the same vicinity
as complete...

1931
02:08:46,902 --> 02:08:48,836
because I couldn't share it with you.

1932
02:08:51,072 --> 02:08:53,006
I couldn't hear your voice...

1933
02:08:55,343 --> 02:08:58,369
or laugh about it with you.

1934
02:09:00,282 --> 02:09:01,943
I miss my...

1935
02:09:02,017 --> 02:09:03,541
I miss my wife.

1936
02:09:19,868 --> 02:09:21,836
We live in a cynical world...

1937
02:09:21,903 --> 02:09:24,497
a cynical world...

1938
02:09:25,573 --> 02:09:29,566
and we work in a business
of tough competitors.

1939
02:09:39,955 --> 02:09:41,946
I love you.

1940
02:09:42,023 --> 02:09:43,456
You...

1941
02:09:45,093 --> 02:09:47,027
complete me.

1942
02:09:48,363 --> 02:09:50,524
- I'm not just...
- Shut up.

1943
02:09:51,766 --> 02:09:53,893
Just shut up.

1944
02:09:53,969 --> 02:09:56,699
You had me at "hello."

1945
02:09:57,539 --> 02:09:59,564
You had me at "hello."

1946
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:15,253
This is the best talking group
I've ever been in.

1947
02:10:15,323 --> 02:10:17,883
Your father leaves home
on Christmas Eve...

1948
02:10:17,959 --> 02:10:20,052
leaves your family all alone;

1949
02:10:20,128 --> 02:10:22,688
had a mother who had to sweep out
the steps at a prison...

1950
02:10:22,764 --> 02:10:24,789
just to earn enough money
for tuition for you.

1951
02:10:24,866 --> 02:10:28,632
Your brother loses a leg
in a tragic bass fishing accident.

1952
02:10:28,703 --> 02:10:32,764
There's been a horrific list of things
that have happened to you in your life.

1953
02:10:32,841 --> 02:10:35,071
I'm not gonna cry, Roy.

1954
02:10:35,143 --> 02:10:38,203
We have some good news for you.
This has just been handed to me.

1955
02:10:38,279 --> 02:10:41,976
A memo. It's signed.
It's a contract guarantee.

1956
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:44,314
"Arizona Cardinals, four years...

1957
02:10:44,386 --> 02:10:47,287
$11.2 million."

1958
02:10:47,355 --> 02:10:49,619
You're gonna get to play in Arizona,
where it all started.

1959
02:10:49,691 --> 02:10:51,784
Finish up your career in Arizona.
What do you think of that?

1960
02:10:57,532 --> 02:10:59,295
Oh, my God.

1961
02:11:11,846 --> 02:11:14,212
I love everybody!

1962
02:11:14,282 --> 02:11:16,580
I love my wife!

1963
02:11:17,519 --> 02:11:19,453
- Baby, I love you.
- I love my kids...

1964
02:11:19,521 --> 02:11:21,921
Tyson, my baby,
my new baby Kaydee.

1965
02:11:21,990 --> 02:11:25,118
My older brother who's got one leg,
but he's still doing it...

1966
02:11:25,193 --> 02:11:27,457
and my younger brother Tee Pee.

1967
02:11:27,529 --> 02:11:31,192
You're militant, but I ain't mad at you.
I got nothing but love for you!

1968
02:11:31,266 --> 02:11:33,393
I love my teammates.

1969
02:11:33,468 --> 02:11:36,301
- I'm leaving somebody out here, Roy.
- We only have a half-hour show.

1970
02:11:36,371 --> 02:11:39,169
I wanna send some beautiful love
out to my offensive line.

1971
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,832
These are fierce, beautiful...

1972
02:11:40,909 --> 02:11:43,469
- Nice to see you. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1973
02:11:43,545 --> 02:11:45,740
- Good for you.
- Thank you. How are you, Lee?

1974
02:11:45,814 --> 02:11:48,612
Hey, Jerry, how you doing?
Remember Troy from the Super Bowl party?

1975
02:11:48,683 --> 02:11:51,311
- I sure do. We met in '93.
- Hi, Jerry. Good to see you.

1976
02:11:51,386 --> 02:11:53,980
- I enjoyed your memo.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1977
02:11:54,055 --> 02:11:56,046
You're a little slow,
but you come around!

1978
02:11:56,124 --> 02:11:59,184
- Okay, we're almost out of time...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1979
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:01,626
I'm forgetting somebody.

1980
02:12:02,931 --> 02:12:06,628
Jerry Maguire, my agent.

1981
02:12:10,538 --> 02:12:12,802
You are my ambassador of kwan, man.

1982
02:12:15,276 --> 02:12:17,210
Rod, thank you so much.
Congratulations.

1983
02:12:17,278 --> 02:12:19,473
Congratulations.
We'll be right back.

1984
02:12:23,184 --> 02:12:25,550
- How did you like the zoo, buddy?
- Swing.

1985
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:27,850
It was great!

1986
02:12:27,922 --> 02:12:30,857
One, two, three, swing!

1987
02:12:33,394 --> 02:12:35,828
Hey, kid, throw the ball!
Come on!

1988
02:12:37,465 --> 02:12:39,399
Come on, throw the ball!

1989
02:12:42,737 --> 02:12:44,534
Whoa!

1990
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:48,575
- Good throw, man!
- Nice throw!

1991
02:12:48,643 --> 02:12:50,110
Yeah!

1992
02:12:50,178 --> 02:12:52,578
Did you see?

1993
02:12:52,647 --> 02:12:55,343
Oh, no. Let's go.

1994
02:12:55,416 --> 02:12:58,283
- What? What?
- Nothing.

1995
02:12:58,353 --> 02:13:00,617
I'm not saying we're gonna throw him
in the major leagues tomorrow.

1996
02:13:00,688 --> 02:13:03,054
But if he's got natural talent
and a pure joy for the game...

1997
02:13:03,124 --> 02:13:05,684
you're lucky you know me,
because I know the right people...

1998
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,921
that will help develop his talent.

1999
02:13:21,442 --> 02:13:24,639
Hey, I don't have all the answers.

2000
02:13:24,712 --> 02:13:30,344
In life, to be honest,
I've failed as much as I've succeeded.

2001
02:13:30,418 --> 02:13:34,047
But I love my wife, I love my life...

2002
02:13:34,122 --> 02:13:37,091
and I wish you my kind of success.
