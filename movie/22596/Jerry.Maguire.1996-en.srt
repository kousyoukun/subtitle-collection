Jerry Maguire『甜心先生』1996

2
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,925
So this is the world, and there are almost six billion people on it.

3
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,392
Title: Jerry Maguire (1996)

4
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,519
When I was a kid,

5
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:49,995
there were three.

6
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:51,258
It's hard to keep up.

7
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,062
There. That's better.

8
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:56,465
That's America.

9
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:59,597
America still sets the tone for the world.

10
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:03,738
In Indiana, Clark Hodd,

11
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,006
13, the best point guard in the country.

12
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:10,649
Last week he scored a hundred points... in a single game.

13
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:14,545
Erica Sorgi. You'll see her in the next Olympics.

14
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:19,015
In Seattle, Dallas Malloy, 16.

15
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:22,290
Her lawsuit helped pave the way for women boxers everywhere.

16
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:25,626
She's picturing her ex-boyfriend right now.

17
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,369
In Indio, California, Art Stallings.

18
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:32,172
Check out what pure joy looks like.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,164
In Odessa, Texas,

20
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:36,301
the great Frank Cushman.

21
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:42,183
This April, 26 teams will be falling all over themselves... to sign him in the next NFL draft.

22
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:44,913
He's my client, my most important client.

23
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:47,978
When are you gonna try? You wanna be a champion?

24
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,852
Believe me, there's genius everywhere,

25
00:01:49,924 --> 00:01:53,253
but until they turn pro...it's like popcorn in the pan... some pop...

26
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:56,455
Darn it! You don't know diddly-squat about golf!

27
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,062
Some don't.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,791
I'm the guy you don't usually see.

29
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,461
I'm the one behind the scenes.

30
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,933
I'm the sports agent.

31
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:08,202
I'm gonna hurt you this year.

32
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:10,001
How you doin'? I'm doing fine.

33
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:13,410
The door is always open if you want a real agent.

34
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:14,809
You're welcome, Johnnie.

35
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:18,211
I'm gonna go to a meeting now, and I'm gonna talk about you.

36
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,015
I'll kill for you.

37
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:22,554
- We gotta win Super Bowls. - I hail you.

38
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,081
- Hey, Jerry, how you doin'? - Good.

39
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:26,960
How much will this cost me?

40
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:30,163
We both know there's a number you can afford.

41
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,626
I'll write it down...and we can move forward from there.

42
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,826


43
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,759
- I can't afford that.

44
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:38,101
- No one said winning was cheap.

45
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:42,977
You know those photos where the new player holds a team jersey... and poses with the owner?

46
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,501
That's me on the left.

47
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:47,447
Inside that building, that's where I work.

48
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,983
SMI, Sports Management International.

49
00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:00,795
Thirty-three out-of-shape agents guiding the careers of 1,685 of the most finely tuned athletes alive.

50
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:03,662
I handle 72 clients

51
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,064
and get an average of 264 phone calls a day. It's what I do.

52
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:09,602
I will not rest until I have you holding a Coke, wearing your own shoe...

53
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,741
playing a Sega game featuring you while singing your own song... in a new commercial starring you...

54
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:16,141
broadcast during the Super Bowl in a game that you are winning.

55
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,871
- I will not sleep until that happens.

56
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:18,809
- It's what I do best.

57
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,346
You get 15 minutes to call me back.

58
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:24,411
I'll be honest. I started noticing it a few years ago and didn't say a word.

59
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:26,953
Was the girl 16 or 17?

60
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,955
In the quest for the big dollars, a lot of the little things were going wrong.

61
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:35,288
There's no proof of anything... except this guy is a sensational athlete.

62
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,364
Are you Calvin Nack? Can you sign my card?

63
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:44,635
I'm sorry, little fella. I can't sign this brand of card.

64
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,966
Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.

65
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:50,039
I just wanted an autograph.

66
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,773
Lately, it's gotten worse.

67
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,173
Remo with the puck and...

68
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:55,715
Oh, he goes down!

69
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,115
Hi, baby.

70
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:02,853
You know your name?

71
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:06,657
Steve Remo.

72
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,190
Steve Remo.

73
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:12,198
Wait. It's comin'.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,191
- My name is Steve Remo. - Yeah.

75
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,997
I play for Chicago.

76
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,666
This lady here is my wife.

77
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,068
Hi, baby.

78
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,736
And this is my boy.

79
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,869
And this is...

80
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:28,582
Wait.

81
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,211
My agent. My agent.

82
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:33,547
I gotta play this weekend, Doc.

83
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:37,155
If I play in 65 percent of my games, I get a bonus.

84
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,622
I gotta get the bonus.

85
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:41,888
Okay, Jesse,

86
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:43,423
you take care, little guy.

87
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:45,226
- Mr. Maguire. - Yeah?

88
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,295
This is his fourth concussion.

89
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:49,700
Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?

90
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:53,504
It would take a tank to stop your dad.

91
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:55,565
It would take all five...

92
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:58,573
Super Trooper VRwarriors...

93
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,371
to stop your dad.

94
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:01,373
Right?

95
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:05,174
Right?

96
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:09,118
Fuck you.

97
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,253
Who had I become?

98
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:15,261
Just another shark in a suit?

99
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:37,807
...with the skyrocketing salaries... and you are one of the guys responsible.

100
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:41,282
- Fuck you. - This guy is a sensational athlete.

101
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,682
Two days later, at our corporate conference in Miami,

102
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,088
a breakthrough.I already had 18 million on the table...

103
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,155
Break down?

104
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,559
Break through.

105
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:54,228
- I just wanted an autograph. - Fuck you.

106
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,566
Do you know your name?

107
00:05:57,371 --> 00:06:00,829
I couldn't escape one simple thought.

108
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,638
I hated myself.

109
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,106
No, here's what it was.

110
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:12,051
I hated my place in the world.

111
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:20,986
I had so much to say and no one to listen.

112
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:24,859
And then it happened.

113
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,933
It was the oddest, most

114
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,002
unexpected thing.

115
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:36,001
I began writing what they call a mission statement.

116
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,472
Not a memo, a mission statement.

117
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:41,606
You know, a suggestion for the future of our company.

118
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,342
A night like this doesn't come along very often.

119
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,751
I seized it.

120
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:53,224
What started out as one page became 25.

121
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:57,089
Suddenly I was my father's son again.

122
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,892
I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job...

123
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,696
how I ended up here out of law school...

124
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:06,103
the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field...

125
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:10,368
the way we are meant to protect them in health and in injury.

126
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,244
With so many clients, we had forgotten what was important.

127
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:18,308
I wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote...

128
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,180
and I'm not even a writer.

129
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:25,793
I was remembering even the words of the original sports agent my mentor the late, great Dicky Fox who said:

130
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,923
The key to this business is personal relationships.

131
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,995
Suddenly it was all pretty clear.

132
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:35,194
The answer was fewer clients, less money.

133
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,204
More attention. Caring for them.

134
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:40,600
Caring for ourselves. And the games too.

135
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:44,132
Just starting our lives, really.

136
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,215
I'll be the first to admit it.

137
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,651
What I was writing was somewhat touchy-feely.

138
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,277
I didn't care. I had lost the ability to bullshit.

139
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:56,016
It was the me I'd always wanted to be.

140
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:03,831
I took it to a Copymat in the middle of the night... and printed up 110 copies.

141
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:06,629
Even the cover looked like The Catcher in the Rye.

142
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:08,901
I entitled it...

143
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:11,904
The Things We Think and Do Not Say:

144
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,498
The Future of Our Business.

145
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,367
That's how you become great, man.

146
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:21,247
Hang your balls out there.

147
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,575
Thanks.

148
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:26,915
Everybody got a copy.

149
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:30,047
There are dangerous animals in the world and some of them walk on two feet.

150
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:32,315
They don't want peace and they're not capable of love.

151
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,922
Society... and that means you and you and you...

152
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,793
need protection from these warped minds.

153
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,577
Boom.

154
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,955
This is Jerry Maguire. - Did those manuscripts get... - They've all gone out.

155
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,352
They did? Oh, no, no, no.

156
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:06,684
That's fine. Thank you.

157
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:25,109
Front desk. How may I help you?

158
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,590
- All right! - Finally, somebody said it.

159
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,592
Good work, Maguire!

160
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,835
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

161
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,276
I was 35.

162
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:05,341
I'd started my life.

163
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,878
How long do you give him?

164
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,286
About a week.

165
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,333
- So you're with the sports people?

166
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,062
- I'm Jerry Maguire.- SMI.

167
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,332
- Bobbi Fallon, BPI.

168
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,396
I'm producing the Coke commercials for the play-offs.

169
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,135
Good luck with that.

170
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:35,911
That'll be four dollars. Hi. My son is really allergic to the material in the blankets.

171
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,416
That's all we have, okay?

172
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:45,090
I'm sorry if I was rude just then.

173
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,683
That's okay.

174
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,318
We're in it together now.

175
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,391
Why is it so easy to talk with you?

176
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,056
- Tell me about your fiancee.

177
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:52,996
- More champagne?

178
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,727
I don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.

179
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,133
- Tell me how you proposed.

180
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,603
- Are you all right? You want some juice?

181
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:01,799
Thank you.

182
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:05,367
But we're hiking up through the pools.

183
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:07,575
Got the ring in my pocket,

184
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:10,014
and I'm a little nervous.

185
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,218
I'm lagging, you know, and she says to me...

186
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:14,618
get this...

187
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,679
"Hurry up, klutz."

188
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:18,850
Well, it bothered me somewhat,

189
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:21,687
and I got quiet. Then she got quiet.

190
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:25,332
And I decide... I am not gonna propose.

191
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:28,130
The mood is not right. Why be impulsive?

192
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:31,103
At this point, I know she knows...

193
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,571
that I was gonna propose and didn't, and she knows I know.

194
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,631
- We check back into the Pro Bowl Hotel.

195
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:36,767
- How sad.

196
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:42,613
But wait.Now, little do I know that my assistant has assumed that I've now proposed.

197
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,321
So she's gotten the lounge band to play "Here Comes the Bride"...

198
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:48,422
- when we walk back in. - I love that song.

199
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:54,019
All the football guys are in the lobby watching. There's even an ESPN crew.

200
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:56,119
So I turn to her,

201
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,686
sort of grandly say...

202
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:00,764
"Well, this is me... klutz...

203
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:04,702
asking you, goddess of rock climbing, to marry me."

204
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:05,897
I took out the ring...

205
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:10,811
I don't much like big scenes...but...

206
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,438
she said yes right there in the lobby.

207
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:17,005
Some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.

208
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,776
I'm getting married in February.

209
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:24,120
You two are gonna be married forever.

210
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:31,861
What's wrong, Mom?

211
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:35,201
First class is what's wrong, honey.

212
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:38,969
It used to be a better meal. Now it's a better life.

213
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:49,444
Ray!

214
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:52,410
Come on, buddy!

215
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,785
High five!

216
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,455
Oh, God. Ray!

217
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,957
Excuse me. Can I help you?

218
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,623
Jerry Maguire.

219
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,392
I work in your office. I was on the junket.

220
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,229
I know who you are. You're Dorothy Boyd in Accounts.

221
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:09,894
You have the side-middle cubicle with the poster of Albert Einstein's face...

222
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,703
morphed on Shaquille O'Neal's body.

223
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,775
That's pretty good.

224
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:19,110
What did you lose here?

225
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,773
My son, my mind.

226
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:23,344
Your son.

227
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:28,450
While I go look... Dorothy?

228
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:32,851
While I look for him, why don't you grab this curious gentleman here?

229
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,187
Thank God.

230
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,528
You scared me.

231
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,263
You scared me.

232
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,169
- Don't do that again, ever.

233
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,399
- Okay, Mommy.

234
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,704
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

235
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:50,970
- Okay? Ever!

236
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:51,840
- Dorothy?

237
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:56,277
- Take care. - Thank you so much.

238
00:13:57,918 --> 00:14:00,045
I loved your memo,

239
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,917
by the way.

240
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,379
- You did?

241
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:05,714
- Yeah.

242
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,319
Thanks.

243
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,432
Actually, it was just a mission statement.

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,061
In this age, optimism like that is a revolutionary act.

245
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:18,332
- You think so?

246
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:19,467
- Yeah.

247
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,165
I appreciate that because

248
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:23,334
I didn't know if I should write...

249
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,901
I mean, it was 2:00 in the morning.

250
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:29,380
I don't know. Some of the stuff I just... Whoo! You know?

251
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:35,152
That part about how we should embrace... "what is still virginal in our enthusiasm..."

252
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,280
Not right now, honey.

253
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,517
"And force open the tightly clenched fist of commerce...

254
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:41,356
and give a little back for the greater good."

255
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:44,256
- Uh-huh. - God. I was inspired.

256
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:47,027
- And I'm an accountant, you know? - One, two, three, swing!

257
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,838
To respect yourself enough to say it out loud?

258
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:56,400
To put yourself out there like that, so openly, so nakedly?

259
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:58,908
- I don't know. - Swing!

260
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,913
It got me.

261
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,978
Is this bothering you?

262
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,515
No, this is...

263
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:10,854
great.

264
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,183
- This is great. - One, two, three, swing!

265
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:16,728
- Do you need a ride? You're okay?

266
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:17,456
- What?

267
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:18,555
- Do you need a lift?

268
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,826
- Oh, no.

269
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:24,032
Yeah, I'm sure that would just make your day...

270
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:26,189
to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach making that left

271
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:28,275
on Waterloo Street, playing chicken with oncoming traffic

272
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:32,837
your life flashing before your eyes.

273
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:36,307
I've obviously had too much coffee, huh?

274
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:37,577
It's no problem.

275
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:43,154
There's my sister Laurel to pick us up.

276
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,212
- Thank you. - Sure.

277
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:46,620
Ray!

278
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:48,883
Dorothy

279
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:51,089
A pleasure.

280
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:53,290
Bye.

281
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,642
Hey, Ray. Hey, you.

282
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,041
I'm double-parked. Let's go.

283
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:06,170
Oh, sorry, honey.

284
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,970
Is this everything?

285
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,643
- These three? - Come here. Let me see you.

286
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:12,440
Dorothy

287
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,489
Man, whoever snagged him must be some classy babe.

288
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,455
Don't ever stop

289
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,156
fucking me!

290
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:28,256
Sooner or later I will have to stop.

291
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,936
Never been better!

292
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,063
Never better!

293
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,199
Never better!

294
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:40,001
Open your eyes.

295
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:45,181
If you ever want me to be with another woman for you...

296
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:46,617
I would do it.

297
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm not interested in it.

298
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,716
There was a time it felt normal for me...

299
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:54,194
but it was a phase... a college thing,

300
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:57,857
like torn Levi's...or law school for you.

301
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:00,093
Want anything from the kitchen? I'm gonna get some fruit.

302
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,476
I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything.

303
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,312
Jerry, this is what intimacy is.

304
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:16,682
Don't forget, tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.

305
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,151
I know about the bachelor party.

306
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,552
Your buddy Dooler worked his ass off to make you a tribute film.

307
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,715
All those guys from the office are coming.

308
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,190
Everybody loves you.

309
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:28,557
Just calm down, relax...

310
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:31,426
act surprised and have an amazing time.

311
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:34,228
Oh, no!

312
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,735
Told ya!

313
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,268
Oh, my God. All right.

314
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:43,002
You! You!

315
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,475
- Sorry. Sorry. - Congratulations.

316
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:46,467
Jerry

317
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,139
Got you, man!

318
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,649
Got you!

319
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,554
Ethan Valhere.

320
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:56,385
Old college buddy.

321
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:57,889
- Congratulations.

322
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:58,686
- Thank you.

323
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:00,481
- For you.

324
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:01,490
- Thank you.

325
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:06,959
And this is for you... the finest cigar... my club has to offer.

326
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,265
This is what it's all about, man.

327
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:11,765
Everybody loves you.

328
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:15,700
Pisses me off.

329
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:21,047
Whether you're country, redneck or a freak...

330
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,775
young or old...

331
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,374
from Moscow, London or Memphis...

332
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:26,380
Jerry Maguire

333
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,512
will still be the king of rock 'n'roll to me.

334
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:33,156
Little black book.

335
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:35,786
When I think aboutJerry, my heart starts pounding.

336
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:38,055
I know Jerry pretty well.

337
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:40,662
Remember me?

338
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,663
- We still on for lunch tomorrow? - Yeah.

339
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,897
He was no slouch in bed.

340
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,666
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

341
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,332
I'll see you later.

342
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:51,707
It's probably a good idea thatJerry get married.

343
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:52,972
He won't be alone.

344
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:54,479
- He cannot be alone.

345
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:57,116
- He can't be alone. He's almost phobic.

346
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,516
Jerry is great at friendship.

347
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:01,816
He's just really bad at intimacy.

348
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:04,413
- He can't be alone. - He can't be alone.

349
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:06,522
- He can't say, "I love you." - Are you listening, Jerry?

350
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:09,062
Lies, lies, lies.

351
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:10,495
He's an agent. He lies.

352
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,621
- I love you too.

353
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,495
- Hey. Love you too.

354
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,930
- Love you too. - Love you, Jerry.

355
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:18,295
- I love you, man. - I love you.

356
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,502
I love you.

357
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:25,009
I love you.

358
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,650
- Good morning, Jenny.

359
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:41,455
- Sorry I missed the bachelor party.

360
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:43,121
Good morning.

361
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:44,527
Marcee's already in your office, and she's late...

362
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,428
for her plane back to Phoenix.

363
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:47,727
Thanks

364
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:49,566
Marcee

365
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,069
I'm glad you finally made it.

366
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:53,401
Rod is very upset.

367
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:54,997
Tyson!- No.

368
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,235
- Okay, Mommy.

369
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:57,241
- Tyson, hello.

370
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,744
- Hello, Jerry. Long time no see!

371
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:01,144
- What did I say, Tyson?

372
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:03,043
- How can I make your life better?

373
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:06,813
This is humiliating, and I'm pregnant and incapable of bullshit.

374
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,649
Where is our offer from Arizona?

375
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,314
Cronin's okay for lunch?

376
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,223
This is one of our agent's, Bob Sugar, and he needs to learn to knock.

377
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:13,952
My pleasure

378
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:15,760
You called our house, right?

379
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:17,991
I'm sorry to interrupt you guys.

380
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:20,891
I don't know what you do for your four percent...

381
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,902
but my husband has a whole plan, an image.

382
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,598
And when you put him in a Waterbed Warehouse commercial... excuse me...

383
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:31,209
you're making him common when you know we deserve the big four:

384
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:34,145
Shoe, car, clothing line, soft drink.

385
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:37,081
I know about the four jewels of the celebrity endorsement dollar.

386
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:40,778
Wow. I majored in marketing, and so did my husband.

387
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,185
We came to play.

388
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:45,481
The Dirty Man is back!

389
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:51,195
Hey, buddy.

390
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:56,192
You okay?

391
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:59,402
Fine.

392
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,531
What's up? Came here to let you go.

393
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:04,574
- Pardon me?

394
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:07,308
- Came here to fire you, Jerry.

395
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,644
It's real. You should say something.

396
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:24,657
- Happy birthday to you - Oh, shit.

397
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,292
A crowded restaurant so there won't be a scene.

398
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,106
You...

399
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:44,047
ungrateful, unctuous...

400
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:46,312
You did this to yourself. You said fewer clients, on paper.

401
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:50,216
Jesus Christ. What about me?

402
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,850
You know what I went through, knowing I had to fire my mentor?

403
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:54,757
Carrying that around for a week?

404
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:57,194
Could you get past yourself for a second?

405
00:21:58,731 --> 00:21:59,663
You'll lose.

406
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,359
- You wanted smaller. - I'm over it.

407
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:04,466
Now I want all my clients and yours too.

408
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:07,036
Whatever.

409
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:26,691
Bring me my numbers.

410
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:45,743
- This is Cush. - Cush! It's Sugar.

411
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:48,713
I'm calling you first 'cause you're the most important guy in sports.

412
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:51,249
I want to know one thing. How does it feel to be a legend?

413
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:53,251
I just want to play football.

414
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,549
Dad! It's one of the agents.

415
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:58,022
Wendy, Cushman's line is busy!

416
00:22:58,091 --> 00:23:00,184
Keep calling him till you get through!

417
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,887
And please bring me my numbers!

418
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:03,394
J.J., what's up, kid?

419
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,795
Yeah, boy. Have you talked to Maguire?

420
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:07,635
Homeboy had a meltdown.

421
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:11,435
I was talking to Doritos about you, and they're very interested in you.

422
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:12,870
Hold on. Talk to Rick, okay?

423
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:14,770
Martinez.

424
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:18,868
Right now you're paying 25 percent of your endorsements to SMI.

425
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:21,436
I would cut my commission by seven percent.

426
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:25,746
I don't wanna say if it was drug-induced, but the guy freaked out.

427
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:29,614
I don't know if you want a guy like that representing you going into the draft. There. I said my piece.

428
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:32,682
I'm gonna make this decision easy for you, okay?

429
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,353
Just what does your heart tell you?

430
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,558
I'm sorry to hear that.

431
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,168
I can't believe they fired him. He's gone.

432
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:46,064
What's going on?

433
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:48,234
They fired Jerry Maguire.

434
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:49,536
Did it at Cronin's.

435
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,736
SMI. This is Cleo.

436
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:00,319
I think you're making a big mistake.

437
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:03,514
I'm concerned about your family and your future.

438
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,455
If you stay here, I don't know what's gonna happen.

439
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,983
I'm sorry. I have a longstanding relationship with SMI.

440
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:11,895
Do you think Maguire knows what it's like to be a black guy?

441
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:16,669
Bob Sugar? He's... He's an entertaining, funny...

442
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,967
I don't know what it's like to be a black person?

443
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:20,505
I'm Mr. Black People!

444
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:24,105
Like I say, don't make it harder than it is.

445
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:28,314
I've gotta be honest with you. This is very personally distressing for me.

446
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:31,875
I haven't seen you since we were with that stripper. Remember her name?

447
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:35,722
I do. It was April. That's my job... to remember the names of skanks you bang on the road.

448
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:38,520
It's not about the money. I do it all for you.

449
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:41,492
This is Jerry Maguire still holding for Katarina.

450
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:43,119
I'm talking about money.

451
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:45,824
I gotta tell ya, it's been a great day.

452
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:46,887
Are you in or out?

453
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:49,161
It's not show friends. It's show business.

454
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:51,893
You are in.

455
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:54,134
- He can't do shit. - That's good.

456
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,665
I want to cry for what they did to you at SMI.

457
00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:03,074
If we weren't right in the middle of the Acura deal... you know I'd go with you.

458
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:06,752
Oh, God!

459
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:13,289
Call waiting. Who could be calling me now?

460
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:15,057
Hi. Kathy Sanders.

461
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:16,322
It's still me.

462
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,798
Kathy... Why are you crying?

463
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:25,800
So you're in.

464
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:27,505
Rod?

465
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:28,972
Jerry Maguire. How're you doin'?

466
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:31,135
Jerry Maguire.

467
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,040
- How're you doin'? - I'll tell you how I'm doin'.

468
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:35,415
I'm sweatin', dude!

469
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:36,984
I'm sweatin' my contract.

470
00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:40,886
I'm sweatin' Bob Sugar telling me I'm missing endorsements by being with you.

471
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,888
That's how I'm doin'. You know what I'm sayin'?

472
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:45,253
I hear you. That's why I'm calling.

473
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,315
I hear that you hear what I'm saying,

474
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,623
but do you truly hear what I'm saying?

475
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:51,561
I hear what you're saying, Daddy.

476
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:54,395
Maybe the best thing is that we get together in person.

477
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,992
Would you mind holding? I just got someone...

478
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,436
Didn't you tell my wife, "More personal attention"?

479
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:03,234
Did you not tell my wife, "More personal attention"?

480
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:05,972
I said, "More personal attention."

481
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:06,739
Good,

482
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:09,680
'cause we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know.

483
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:11,239
You can take notes.

484
00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:14,218
I will kill for you, maim for you, rape and pillage for you.

485
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:15,879
I am a valuable commodity.

486
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:19,192
I go across the middle. I see a dude coming at me,

487
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:21,251
trying to kill me, I tell myself...

488
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,158
"Get killed. Catch the ball."

489
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:24,719
Touchdown.

490
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,287
I make miracles happen.

491
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,356
Are you in, or are you out?

492
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:29,924
I'm from Arizona.

493
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,129
I broke Arizona records.

494
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:33,763
I went to Arizona State.

495
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,603
I'm a Sun Devil, man.

496
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:37,108
Now you want Arizona dollars.

497
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:38,200
- Exactly.

498
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:39,676
- I understand what you're saying.

499
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:44,117
I'm sitting here with an ant problem. I got ants going up and down my hallway.

500
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:46,711
My brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with...

501
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,021
We got a flood in Tee Pee's room. Hang on.

502
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:51,784
Say hello to Jerry Maguire.

503
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,587
Hello, Brother Maguire.

504
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:54,421
- Hello, Tee Pee.

505
00:26:54,494 --> 00:26:56,621
- My house is falling apart!

506
00:26:56,696 --> 00:26:58,721
Nobody's looking out for Rod Tidwell.

507
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:00,698
We don't know where we're gonna live in a year.

508
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:04,100
And I'm supposed to be a superstar, man!

509
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,604
I need your decision. Are you in or out?

510
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:10,506
You're gonna be happy you stayed with Bob Sugar 'cause I am the Terminator!

511
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:14,205
I am a role model! I have a family to support.

512
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,269
Hear me?

513
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:17,077
I wanna stay in Arizona.

514
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,640
I want my new contract.

515
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:21,778
But I like you. Yes, I like you, Jerry.

516
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:23,925
My wife likes you.

517
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:27,258
You're good to my wife. I will stay with you.

518
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:29,317
That's great. I'm very happy.

519
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,794
- Are you listening? - Yes.

520
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:32,867
That's what I'm gonna do for you.

521
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:36,462
God bless you. But this is what you're gonna do for me.

522
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:37,531
Jerry

523
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:40,071
What can I do for you? Just tell me.

524
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:42,130
What can I do for you?

525
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,937
It's a very personal,

526
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:46,043
very important thing.

527
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,179
Hell, it's a family motto.

528
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:49,236
- Are you ready?

529
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:49,974
- I'm ready.

530
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:52,040
Just wanna make sure you're ready.

531
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,244
Here it is.

532
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:57,651
Show me the money.

533
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,391
Show...

534
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,951
me...

535
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,497
the...

536
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:06,793
money!

537
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,563
Doesn't it make you feel good just to say that?

538
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:13,305
- Say it with me one time.

539
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,532
- Show you the money.

540
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:15,972
You can do better than that.

541
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,976
Say it with meaning, brother.

542
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:20,604
I got Bob Sugar on the other line. I better hear you say it.

543
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,238
Show you the money.

544
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:24,749
Not show "you." Show "me" the money.

545
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:27,547
- Show me the money. - Yeah! Louder!

546
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,214
Show me the money.

547
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:31,119
- You got to yell that shit!

548
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,248
- Show me the money!

549
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:33,690
- I need to feel you!

550
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,056
- Show me the money!

551
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:36,151
You better yell!

552
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:38,697
- Show me the money!

553
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:42,760
- Show me the money!

554
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:44,334
- Do you love this black man?

555
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,098
- I love this black man!

556
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,072
Show me the money!

557
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,664
- I love black people!

558
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:51,539
- I love black people!

559
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:52,942
- Who's your motherfucker, Jerry?

560
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:55,503
- You're my motherfucker!

561
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:56,843
- What you gonna do?

562
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,976
- Show me the money!

563
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:03,017
Congratulations. You're still my agent.

564
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:35,918
Well, don't worry.

565
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:38,113
Don't worry.

566
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:41,655
I'm not gonna do what you all think I'm gonna do,

567
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:42,591
which is just flip out.

568
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,168
Let me just say as I...

569
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:54,270
ease out of the office...

570
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,399
I helped build...

571
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,306
I'm sorry, but it's a fact...

572
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:03,573
that there is such a thing as manners.

573
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:07,411
A way of treating people.

574
00:30:10,356 --> 00:30:12,256
These fish have manners.

575
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:15,488
These fish have manners.

576
00:30:15,928 --> 00:30:17,896
In fact, they're coming with me.

577
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:19,659
I'm starting a new company...

578
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:21,359
and the fish will come with me.

579
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:24,870
You can call me sentimental.

580
00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:28,133
The fish, they're coming with me.

581
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:33,844
Come on. Come on. You come on.

582
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,209
Come here. How is that?

583
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:39,717
Ok

584
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:47,560
If anybody else... wants to come with me...

585
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:50,926
this moment will be the moment of something

586
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:54,360
real...and fun and inspiring...

587
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,098
in this godforsaken business... and we will do it together.

588
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:04,170
Who's coming with me?

589
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:05,801
Who's coming with me?

590
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:09,438
Who's coming with me?

591
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,487
Who's coming with me besides...

592
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:17,379
Flipper here?

593
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:25,654
This is embarrassing.

594
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,369
All right.

595
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:35,032
Wendy

596
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:36,701
- Shall we? - I'm...

597
00:31:36,976 --> 00:31:41,446
I'm three months away from the pay increase.

598
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:49,984
Okey

599
00:31:58,431 --> 00:31:59,921
I will go with you.

600
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:03,895
Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

601
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:12,702
Right now?

602
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:18,078
Don't do it.

603
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:25,145
Bye.

604
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,794
We'll see you all again.

605
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,799
Sleep tight.

606
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,101
Bye.

607
00:32:40,873 --> 00:32:43,137
Let's see how they do without us.

608
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:58,689
Thank you.

609
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,515
I know this is a bad time,

610
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:03,152
but you will have a medical program?

611
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:05,094
Sure, yes, medical.

612
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:08,197
I don't know what l...

613
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:13,203
When you think about what you did there, don't panic.

614
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:16,537
We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be great.

615
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:19,940
We're gonna be... great.

616
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:22,710
Yes.

617
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:55,340
I wonder what he said.

618
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:58,248
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired.

619
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:01,315
He just said, "You complete me."

620
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,838
We've all got a problem.

621
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:22,273
We're all stuck in some kind of pattern.

622
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:25,368
- It's true. - She was making an excellent point.

623
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:27,969
We have come here to support one another...

624
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:30,572
and we don't even listen to one another.

625
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:35,348
Women are taught not to see each other as good people.

626
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,048
We see each other as the enemy.

627
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:39,556
We're competition for men.

628
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,422
It's true. We have this terrible competition thing going on.

629
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:45,431
I really, really hated women,

630
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:49,299
and then I met you guys...and you're like, you know, me.

631
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:53,702
And it's important because I know that you can be my friends.

632
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:55,065
- What about medical?

633
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,165
- Of course medical.

634
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:59,871
You are a single mother. You have given up the right to be frivolous.

635
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:03,142
If you had read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.

636
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:05,445
I can always take that job in San Diego.

637
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,916
Do you know how much those Well-Child exams cost?

638
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:09,648
- $150. - Yes, that's right.

639
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,383
And that's just when he's well.

640
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:12,924
Where is Ray?

641
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:14,186
- Asleep in the living room.

642
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,625
- That's wonderful.

643
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:17,787
The next time you decide to lecture me...

644
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:20,730
don't leave my boy with that divorced women's group.

645
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:25,695
So I finally got in touch with my anger.

646
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:28,262
Yeah! You go, Alice!

647
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:33,768
- What's her problem?

648
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,677
- Quit her job.

649
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:37,939
My God, what did I do?

650
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:41,677
Function, function, function.

651
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:46,015
Forward motion is everything. Cush saves all.

652
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:47,954
You go to Texas.

653
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:50,757
You keep one superstar, and they'll all follow.

654
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:52,660
- There's no real loyalty. - None.

655
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:55,757
And the first person who told me that was you.

656
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,592
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.

657
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:02,272
Well, it worked. And I will not let you fail.

658
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,071
You areJerry Ma-fuckin'-guire!

659
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:06,372
- That's right.

660
00:36:06,445 --> 00:36:09,175
- King of the house calls.

661
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:11,443
Master of the living room.

662
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,212
This is working.

663
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:15,480
You are not a loser.

664
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:19,720
- Who said anything about loser?

665
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,316
- Mistake. I meant something else.

666
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:22,826
When do you want to leave?

667
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:52,746
- Matt?

668
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:54,850
- I'm in the back den, Jer.

669
00:36:56,795 --> 00:36:58,922
You like a bloody beer?

670
00:36:58,997 --> 00:36:59,895
- I'm fine.

671
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:01,592
- Beer and tomato juice.

672
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:04,125
I'm fine.

673
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,530
I'm here today. We spent a lot of time together.

674
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:09,801
You know how much I care about you and your son.

675
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:14,414
I'm quite concerned because if you stay with SMI, your son...

676
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:16,539
We decided to stay with you.

677
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:26,286
I'm not really a hugger, and yet...

678
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:29,117
I can't let go.

679
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:31,356
I told myself,

680
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,557
"He shows up, we stick with him."

681
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:37,396
Hey, Jerry, how's it goin'?

682
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,762
Cush.

683
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:41,567
How are you, Cush? How are you?

684
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:44,706
- You remember Keith? - Keith, how you doin'?

685
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:47,605
I want him to go number one in the draft...

686
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:49,546
and I want him to play.

687
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,981
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.

688
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,244
He'll go number one.

689
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:54,979
- I'll either surf or ski. I don't care.

690
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:57,253
- Denver's where he should be.

691
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:58,949
I'll give it everything.

692
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:01,622
You know I don't do contracts...

693
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:04,761
but what you do have is my word...

694
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,593
and it's stronger than oak.

695
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,673
I was so tired

696
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:18,711
Can't understand it

697
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,877
Just call me angel

698
00:38:28,322 --> 00:38:29,846
Breaking her heart

699
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:33,124
And I'm free

700
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:38,988
Free fallin'

701
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:45,091
yeah, I'm free

702
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:50,505
Free fallin'

703
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:00,884
Hello?

704
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:02,580
Jerry Maguire

705
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:03,678
Is Avery there?

706
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:05,759
She had to fly to Atlanta.

707
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:09,487
- She had a meeting at the NFL office. - The Playhouse rocks.

708
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:11,188
Wait. Oh, God. Sweetheart...

709
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:12,730
- Hello? - Go sit by Chad. Sorry.

710
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:13,992
- Hello? -  Sorry.

711
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:17,058
That was my son and the nanny.

712
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:18,568
- What are they all doing in our office?

713
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:19,865
- Nanny?

714
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:21,997
I prefer "child technician."

715
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:25,132
I had the calls transferred to my house

716
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,939
so I could go over some of your stuff.

717
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:29,708
That's fine. Dorothy, we are back.

718
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:33,182
We are so very, very back.

719
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:35,413
I re-signed Cush. We're set.

720
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:37,751
I am so happy for you.

721
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:39,120
- Happy for us.

722
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,351
- Happy for us.

723
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:42,689
Okay, happy for us.

724
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:45,486
Rod, being at the draft with me is a good idea.

725
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:47,759
- Just get on the plane - Why not?

726
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,994
and meet us.

727
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:52,798
- Good. We'll see you there. - God bless you.

728
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:56,534
Avery will meet you at the "B" gate at 4:15. Don't be late.

729
00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:59,168
Do you know the human head weighs eight pounds?

730
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,314
Did you know that Troy Aikman, in only six years, has passed...

731
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:06,647
for 16,303 yards?

732
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:10,386
Do you know bees and dogs can smell fear?

733
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:13,181
I put Tidwell on the same floor at the Marriott Marquis.

734
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:15,021
- He doesn't smoke, does he?

735
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:15,855
- I don't know.

736
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:18,988
Did you know the career record for most hits is 4,256...

737
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:21,328
by Pete Rose who is not in the Hall of Fame?

738
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,767
Do you know that my next-door neighbor had three rabbits?

739
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:29,172
I can't compete with that.

740
00:40:31,243 --> 00:40:33,643
So did we go over everything?

741
00:40:33,712 --> 00:40:34,371
- Yes? - Yep.

742
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:36,846
- Back on Tuesday, right? - Yeah.

743
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:43,278
Ray, have a good time at school. Wish me luck.

744
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:44,913
Luck!

745
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,880
How're you doin', Jerry?

746
00:41:09,616 --> 00:41:11,049
Cush!

747
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:13,212
- How are you, man? - We should really be sellin' these.

748
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:19,548
Terrific. This is my agent. You might want to get his autograph.

749
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:21,453
Man, my hand's getting tired.

750
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:23,024
Excuse me.

751
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:24,527
What's happenin'?

752
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:25,995
Are you Hootie?

753
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:29,434
No, I am not Hootie.

754
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:31,561
No, punk.

755
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:38,369
Is it gonna be San Diego or Denver?

756
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:41,335
Surf or ski.

757
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:47,117
- He'll either surf or ski. - Go to Denver!

758
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:51,686
- I'll either surf or ski. - Right here!

759
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:55,782
Rod

760
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:58,792
At last, I find you.

761
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:01,992
What am I doing here? I feel like I'm five years late for the prom.

762
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:03,193
- Come with me.

763
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:05,463
- Nobody cares about me being here.

764
00:42:05,537 --> 00:42:08,506
We're gonna go downstairs and walk through this lobby.

765
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:11,337
I want every media guy, every player's rep, everybody...

766
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,844
to see you for what you are...

767
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:16,739
the best-kept secret in the NFL.

768
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,551
The most commanding wide receiver in the game.

769
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:24,055
You are fast, fierce, wildly charismatic.

770
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:26,920
You are the man. You are the man. You ready?

771
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:27,959
- Let's go.

772
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:28,890
- Let's walk.

773
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,554
You are the greatest, fiercest.

774
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:34,094
You are the man.

775
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:35,866
Let's do it.

776
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:36,832
- How are you?

777
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,631
- How's it goin'?

778
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:39,432
- Where's Cush?

779
00:42:39,504 --> 00:42:40,163
- He's upstairs.

780
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,206
It's good you were able to hang onto Cushman.

781
00:42:42,274 --> 00:42:44,435
- Will it be San Diego or Denver? - We'll know tomorrow. Meet Rod Tidwell.

782
00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:50,149
- How're you doin', my man? - 110 receptions, 1,550 yards last year.

783
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:52,412
I'd like you to meet Rod Tidwell.

784
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,143
What's up, man?

785
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,156
- 110 receptions, 1,550 yards last year. - That's right.

786
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:13,798
Now I'm going to talk about Rodney Tidwell who is... the fiercest wide receiver in the NFL.

787
00:43:24,149 --> 00:43:27,084
I came all that way just to walk the lobby.

788
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:29,518
Yeah. Might have even worked too.

789
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:33,416
Yeah? Shit, let's do that shit again.

790
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:34,948
Look

791
00:43:35,827 --> 00:43:37,556
They're shooting a Reebok ad.

792
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:40,625
Where are my endorsements? You know what I'm saying?

793
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:45,100
I didn't get no love from Chevy. I didn't get no love from Pepsi.

794
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,731
I didn't even get no love from that Energizer bunny.

795
00:43:47,806 --> 00:43:49,364
I ain't getting no love from Nike.

796
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:51,932
Obviously I ain't gettin' no love from Reebok.

797
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,069
Did I ever tell you my Reebok story?

798
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:56,273
Gotta get back to Cushman.

799
00:43:56,348 --> 00:43:59,442
You gotta get back to your golden paycheck.

800
00:43:59,518 --> 00:44:00,951
I'll boil it down for you.

801
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:05,624
Fuck Reebok. All they do is ignore me.

802
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:08,889
Always have.Always have.

803
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:11,559
You know what was great about you down there?

804
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,668
For about five minutes, you unloaded that rather large chip... that resides right there on your shoulder.

805
00:44:16,668 --> 00:44:18,192
You let people in.

806
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:21,805
You were brilliant.

807
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:23,870
- Brilliant?

808
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:24,909
- Brilliant.

809
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:25,635
- Really?

810
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:27,840
- Now take care. I'll see you tomorrow.

811
00:44:28,747 --> 00:44:30,476
You're loving me now, aren't you?

812
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,915
I'm not about love. I'm about showing you the money.

813
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:35,009
I was just testing you, Jerry.

814
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:38,817
But to hear you say that makes me love you, baby!

815
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,721
You know?

816
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:41,884
Jerry, come back!

817
00:44:45,297 --> 00:44:46,364
- How was your flight? - Good, man. How was yours?

818
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:47,888
- How was your flight? - Good, man. How was yours?

819
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:49,760
- What size are you?

820
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:50,494
- Twelve and a half.

821
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:53,470
Grab a couple pairs of them new shoes by the door.

822
00:44:54,906 --> 00:45:01,641
It's okay to eat fish 'Cause they haven't got

823
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:02,907
- No feelings - Cush. Matt.

824
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:05,014
We have a decision to make.

825
00:45:06,818 --> 00:45:10,618
San Diego just came in with a last minute scenario. It's big.

826
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:13,213
Well, he's got to go number one.

827
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:17,886
He goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade him up with Denver... and they want him bad.

828
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,924
What happened to Denver?

829
00:45:19,998 --> 00:45:22,558
This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.

830
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:28,231
Let me tell you something. San Diego is crazy to the tune of...

831
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:29,898
seven years for 30, signing bonus of eight.

832
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:31,340
Should I unplug the phone?

833
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:33,843
Reporters. They've been calling all night.

834
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:35,971
Just be friendly and say, "No comment."

835
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:37,446
We'll tell the world in 12 hours.

836
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:41,450
Talking and saying nothing, man... it is an art I have not mastered.

837
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,420
Well, let me do it. Wait.

838
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:47,222
For you, it's a pleasure.

839
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:50,452
This is Cush.

840
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,620
It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?

841
00:45:52,697 --> 00:45:54,892
Just sniff if he's there.

842
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,428
All right, buddy. Just remember, you're swimming with the big boys now.

843
00:45:57,502 --> 00:46:00,372
Let your dad do all the talking.

844
00:46:00,372 --> 00:46:02,704
I got you the deal you needed.

845
00:46:02,774 --> 00:46:04,765
This is business, not friendship.

846
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:09,246
You gotta be strong 'cause you're global now, worldwide.

847
00:46:09,314 --> 00:46:10,872
Okay, buddy?

848
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:13,380
I'll see you later. Bye.

849
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:19,317
No comment.

850
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:27,496
- He's got it all wrong.

851
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:29,192
- It's Cush on the big TV again.

852
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:30,825
I'm sick of me already.

853
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:32,096
I've got "Cushlash."

854
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:34,298
Cushlash

855
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,675
Now, Matt, before I go back to Denver...

856
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:51,552
we should put something down on paper. Something that says, "I'm with Jerry Maguire."

857
00:46:51,623 --> 00:46:52,954
Not right now.

858
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:02,964
Do I know everything there is to know here?

859
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:10,804
You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?

860
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:15,175
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.

861
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:17,644
Said who?

862
00:47:17,716 --> 00:47:18,876
Sugar?

863
00:47:19,784 --> 00:47:21,752
I'm learning as I go here.

864
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,847
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?

865
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:29,353
I'm sorry.

866
00:47:30,562 --> 00:47:31,893
- I love my son.

867
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:34,227
- I love your son. I love your son!

868
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:38,695
I brought Denver to 20 million. Denver deals with me all the time.

869
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,068
You listened to Sugar.

870
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:43,300
Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child.

871
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:46,572
You let that snake in the door?

872
00:47:49,414 --> 00:47:52,906
This is a rookie mistake.

873
00:47:52,984 --> 00:47:56,044
You want Denver. I'll fix this whole thing up for you.

874
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:58,521
You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right?

875
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:02,290
Matt

876
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:06,058
Tell me you didn't sign.

877
00:48:06,898 --> 00:48:13,094
Tell me you didn't sign 'cause I'm still sort of moved... by your " My word is stronger than oak" thing.

878
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:17,605
We signed an hour ago.

879
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:20,509
You were in the lobby

880
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:23,275
with the black fella.

881
00:48:25,717 --> 00:48:27,241
I'm sorry, Jerry.

882
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:29,218
I just wanna play football.

883
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,854
What do I do? How do I spin this?

884
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:37,451
Honey, it's spun.

885
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:40,255
What did I do to you?

886
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:41,764
It's all about you, isn't it?

887
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:44,893
- "Soothe me, save me, love me." - Stop moving.

888
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,869
- Could you stop moving? - I have to finish my job.

889
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:49,771
Everything is on the fucking run with us.

890
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:53,436
Jerry, you and I are salespeople. We sell.

891
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:55,138
It's not "Love me."

892
00:48:55,213 --> 00:48:56,805
It's not "Trust my handshake."

893
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:00,783
It's "Make the sale," "Get it signed." There shouldn't be confusion about that.

894
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:03,650
Just jump right into my nightmare. The water is warm.

895
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:06,019
So honesty is outlawed here? I can't be honest?

896
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:08,423
I would prefer loyalty.

897
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,659
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?

898
00:49:14,332 --> 00:49:16,857
I think you added the "brutal."

899
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:21,395
There is a sensitivity thing that some people have.

900
00:49:21,473 --> 00:49:22,701
I don't have it.

901
00:49:22,774 --> 00:49:24,503
I don't cry at movies.

902
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:28,313
I don't gush over babies. I don't start celebrating Christmas five months early.

903
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:32,147
And I don't tell a man who just screwed up both our lives, "Poor baby."

904
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,850
That's me, for better or worse.

905
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,920
But I do love you.

906
00:49:41,926 --> 00:49:45,554
- Avery? - No. - It's over. - Didn't hear it.

907
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:48,599
There's something missing here, don't you think?

908
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:50,095
- You have never been alone.

909
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:50,896
- Listen to me.

910
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:52,197
- And you can't be alone.

911
00:49:52,537 --> 00:49:54,368
- It's over.

912
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,802
No one has ever dumped me.

913
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:04,272
I'm not trying to make history here.

914
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:10,546
I did the 23-hour nose route... to the top of El Capitan in 18 hours and 23 minutes.

915
00:50:10,622 --> 00:50:12,283
I can make this work.

916
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,325
No.

917
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,424
Jerry

918
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,740
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

919
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,988
I won't let you hurt me.

920
00:50:44,055 --> 00:50:46,649
I'm too strong for you, loser.

921
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:50,928
Fuck.

922
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,157
Roll with the punches. Tomorrow's another day.

923
00:50:57,635 --> 00:50:58,329
Taxi!

924
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,802
You lovin' me now, aren't you?

925
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:05,273
Very much. Taxi!

926
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,146
Is it my imagination, or didn't we arrive in a limo?

927
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:10,880
The question I have is this...

928
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:14,146
I hope this doesn't come off too much like I'm a shrink.

929
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:17,118
What's wrong?

930
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:19,816
- Man, I'm just a big disappointment.

931
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:20,789
- Look at this.

932
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:25,663
Can't change it. Everybody cries on this show. Can't change it.

933
00:51:25,663 --> 00:51:28,393
You mad you tested positive? Quit doing blow.

934
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,425
Upset about your baby girl?

935
00:51:31,803 --> 00:51:34,431
Why'd you leave her mother? I knew her. She was all right.

936
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:39,533
People, like the media, don't understand... what kind of problems and pressures 54 million come with.

937
00:51:39,611 --> 00:51:41,340
- This is some bullshit.

938
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:42,970
- What are you doing with me, Rod?

939
00:51:43,082 --> 00:51:45,175
I'm still poor in life.

940
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,012
- What?

941
00:51:46,084 --> 00:51:47,312
- Don't you even see?

942
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:52,691
I'm finished. I am fucked.

943
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,924
Twenty-four hours ago, man, I was hot.

944
00:51:56,995 --> 00:51:58,257
Now...

945
00:51:59,297 --> 00:52:00,821
I'm a cautionary tale.

946
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:03,625
See this jacket I'm wearing? You like it?

947
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:06,761
'Cause I don't really need it because I'm cloaked in failure!

948
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:10,629
I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft!

949
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:12,810
Why? Let's recap.

950
00:52:12,877 --> 00:52:17,644
Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk.

951
00:52:17,715 --> 00:52:21,947
I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed and grew a conscience!

952
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:25,420
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.

953
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:31,356
I got a shelf life of ten years, tops.

954
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:36,868
My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars... that'll last me and mine a very long time.

955
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:39,462
Shit, I'm out of this sport in five years.

956
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,528
What's my family gonna live on?

957
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:45,305
Huh? You get me?

958
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:47,535
So I don't wanna hear your shit.

959
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,580
I don't wanna hear your

960
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:52,741
"Oh, I lost Cush, Avery" and shit.

961
00:52:52,817 --> 00:52:55,183
Can I have another drink, please?

962
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:58,779
Anybody else would've left you by now...

963
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:02,393
but I'm sticking with you. I said I would.

964
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:06,659
And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you gonna show me the money.

965
00:53:06,731 --> 00:53:08,392
You gonna show me the money.

966
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:14,038
Shit. We together on this. You know what I'm sayin'?

967
00:53:14,038 --> 00:53:15,699
We gonna be one.

968
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:20,901
The both of us. You know?

969
00:53:21,212 --> 00:53:23,146
Oh, my God.

970
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:30,180
You have no messages.

971
00:53:56,381 --> 00:53:58,246
- He's coming over. - Tonight?

972
00:53:58,316 --> 00:54:01,513
He just lost his best client. I invited the guy over.

973
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:03,516
Dorothy, this is not a guy.

974
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:07,149
It's a syndrome: Early-midlife- hangin'-on-to-the-bottom-rung...

975
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:08,749
dear-God-don't-let-me-be-alone...

976
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:11,659
I'll-call-my-long-suffering-assistant- without-medical-for-company syndrome.

977
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:14,960
Lf, knowing all that, you still want him to come over, I'm not saying a thing.

978
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,897
Honey, he's engaged.

979
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:21,564
For the first time in my career, I'm part of something I believe in.

980
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:25,007
Okay. But he better not be good-looking!

981
00:54:27,945 --> 00:54:28,604
Hi

982
00:54:31,149 --> 00:54:32,810
I'm Jerry Maguire.

983
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:35,141
Hello

984
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,480
You are just the way I pictured you.

985
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,990
I'm her disapproving sister, Laurel.

986
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,093
Honesty. Thank you.

987
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:49,791
Thank you.

988
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:56,733
Your boss is here.

989
00:54:57,275 --> 00:54:59,004
Hello

990
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:03,846
- Be careful. - Hey, you.

991
00:55:04,682 --> 00:55:07,242
- God, thanks for inviting me over.

992
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:08,182
- Sure. Where's...

993
00:55:09,387 --> 00:55:11,082
Where's the little guy?

994
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:13,255
- He's sleeping. - Yeah, sleeping.

995
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,518
I'm so glad you're home.

996
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:21,388
That alone thing is not my specialty.

997
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,964
Oh, my God.

998
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:24,793
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

999
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,204
Well, I broke up with Avery.

1000
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,345
It's just...

1001
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:38,112
Gosh, you know, that's too bad.

1002
00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:41,083
No, it's better because...

1003
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:44,349
we're still gonna be friends, and it's better now than later.

1004
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:45,616
Sure. Sure.

1005
00:55:48,726 --> 00:55:49,886
- I'm dying here, aren't I?

1006
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:52,555
- Yeah, it's a really bad cut.

1007
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,224
Well, just think if I'd got her the ring she really wanted.

1008
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:04,134
- Yeah. - Why don't you have a seat?

1009
00:56:04,942 --> 00:56:09,637
I'll... I'll get some aloe vera for that cut.

1010
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:13,243
- Do you have something to drink?

1011
00:56:13,317 --> 00:56:14,181
- Sure.

1012
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:21,490
- I heard. - No kidding.

1013
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:26,359
I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the kitchen doorway.

1014
00:56:26,397 --> 00:56:29,195
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.

1015
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,926
Don't use those. Use the frosted glasses.

1016
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:34,937
- Thank you.

1017
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:35,665
- You're welcome.

1018
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,298
I warmed up some of that chicken with salsa for you.

1019
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,536
That's the girl I love.

1020
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:42,272
I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna say this.

1021
00:56:42,346 --> 00:56:44,439
You have always been very responsible with Ray.

1022
00:56:44,515 --> 00:56:48,884
It's not right for him to wake up and hear a strange man's voice in the house.

1023
00:56:48,953 --> 00:56:49,783
- Some drunken stranger.

1024
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:52,049
- As opposed to ten angry women?

1025
00:56:54,525 --> 00:56:55,822
Lean forward.

1026
00:56:55,893 --> 00:56:57,884
Okay, I've got it.

1027
00:56:57,962 --> 00:57:00,089
Still edible. Change your shirt.

1028
00:57:00,164 --> 00:57:00,892
Everything's fine.

1029
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:09,098
Hey, Jerry

1030
00:57:10,942 --> 00:57:12,500
Ray

1031
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:16,048
Aren't you supposed to be in bed?

1032
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,071
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1033
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:19,878
Don't worry

1034
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:22,516
I won't tell.

1035
00:57:23,154 --> 00:57:27,022
The human head weighs eight pounds.

1036
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:39,099
Jerry Maguire

1037
00:57:39,604 --> 00:57:40,901
I think it's this one.

1038
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:44,906
You should be dreamin' about me, baby.

1039
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:47,444
I should be on your mind constantly. My agent should be thinking Rod Tidwell.

1040
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:50,241
That's when big dollars are gonna flow,

1041
00:57:50,314 --> 00:57:52,578
when we truly will materialize the kwan.

1042
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:53,514
- Who is this?

1043
00:57:53,584 --> 00:57:55,074
- Who is this?

1044
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:58,087
You are speaking to the Rod Tidwell. I need to speak with my agent.

1045
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:01,147
I need to be my agent. My agent and I should be one.

1046
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:02,624
- Are you a football player?

1047
00:58:02,693 --> 00:58:04,786
- Am I a football player?

1048
00:58:04,862 --> 00:58:07,456
I'm a schoolteacher about to whomp your ass!

1049
00:58:07,531 --> 00:58:09,396
PutJerry Maguire on the phone!

1050
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:11,094
I'm not saying anything else. Just one more thing.

1051
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:14,194
You don't have the luxury of falling for some drowning man. Be practical.

1052
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:15,203
Practical?

1053
00:58:15,272 --> 00:58:17,576
Which top, high turtleneck sensible or low V-neck sexy?

1054
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:20,739
- Turtleneck, turtleneck. Come on. - Don't tell me to be practical.

1055
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:24,008
Do you know what other women my age are doing right now?

1056
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:27,312
They're out partying in clubs, trying to get a man, keep a man.

1057
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:29,319
Not me, Laurel.

1058
00:58:29,387 --> 00:58:31,582
I'm trying to raise a man.

1059
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:33,083
This one.

1060
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:37,857
I've got a 24-hour-a-day reminder of Roger for the rest of my life.

1061
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:41,659
I've had three lovers in four years.

1062
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:42,458
Not bad.

1063
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:46,299
All of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath.

1064
00:58:46,971 --> 00:58:48,438
Look at me, Laurel.

1065
00:58:48,506 --> 00:58:51,532
I'm the oldest 26-year-old in the world.

1066
00:58:51,776 --> 00:58:52,936
- Now, how do I look?

1067
00:58:53,244 --> 00:58:54,006
- Good.

1068
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:56,078
Yeah? Thanks.

1069
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:58,775
Seventy-two percent of new buyers are African-American.

1070
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:00,749
I am African-American. Make the connection.

1071
00:59:00,818 --> 00:59:02,080
You talk too much.

1072
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:05,054
Talking is only a primitive form of communication!

1073
00:59:05,122 --> 00:59:07,750
Fun talking to you. Bye, Rod.

1074
00:59:07,825 --> 00:59:08,814
Jerry

1075
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:10,621
Make a sandwich.

1076
00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:15,066
Good idea. I just want to say one thing. You do listen to me.

1077
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:16,966
- Well, I love you. Mayo?

1078
00:59:17,034 --> 00:59:17,693
- Yeah.

1079
00:59:17,935 --> 00:59:20,927
Oppression as a religion.

1080
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:25,209
My daddy worked for the United Way for 38 years. You know what he said when he retired?

1081
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:28,645
He said, " I wish they'd given me a more comfortable chair."

1082
00:59:28,713 --> 00:59:30,408
- Wait, wait. - Thirty-eight years he sat in that.

1083
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:32,418
Then my dad died.

1084
00:59:32,418 --> 00:59:36,819
My mom took me to the zoo, and I love the zoo, but...

1085
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:38,255
No, wait, wait.

1086
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:39,916
I want to tell you more about my dad.

1087
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:42,322
No, let's go to the zoo.

1088
00:59:44,195 --> 00:59:48,099
Okay. No, you're right.

1089
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:50,966
I don't know. It's just my whole life I've been trying to talk.

1090
00:59:51,035 --> 00:59:54,630
I mean, really talk.

1091
00:59:55,473 --> 00:59:57,600
But no one wants to listen to me.

1092
00:59:57,675 --> 01:00:00,878
You know that feeling? They just look at you.

1093
01:00:00,878 --> 01:00:03,642
Let's go right now. Let's go to the zoo.

1094
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:05,238
Ray, the zoo, you know...

1095
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,048
The fucking zoo's closed, Ray.

1096
01:00:11,455 --> 01:00:13,389
You said "fuck."

1097
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,256
Yeah, I did. Is that...

1098
01:00:17,094 --> 01:00:18,994
I won't tell.

1099
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:27,002
Well. Now I'm gonna have to take you to the zoo.

1100
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:30,234
I gotta go to bed.

1101
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:32,400
My mom's coming. I gotta go to bed.

1102
01:00:34,845 --> 01:00:37,143
I hear my mom. I gotta go to bed.

1103
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:39,506
- Hey, thanks for listening.

1104
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:40,311
- Sure.

1105
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:44,412
Okay.

1106
01:00:44,455 --> 01:00:46,082
Drinks, food,

1107
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,618
and I called you a cab.

1108
01:00:49,894 --> 01:00:51,361
Good idea.

1109
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:54,022
We should keep our voices down. I have a little boy asleep.

1110
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,262
Right.

1111
01:00:57,935 --> 01:00:59,232
Our company.

1112
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:02,106
Yeah.

1113
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:08,067
Okay, okay. Look. A little speech before I go.

1114
01:01:13,584 --> 01:01:18,649
Do not worry... about your future.

1115
01:01:18,689 --> 01:01:21,157
You and your son...

1116
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:25,252
We are just fine. You still have a job.

1117
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:31,565
But let me tell you something aboutJerry Maguire, okay?

1118
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:36,072
You come after me, and you will lose.

1119
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,535
Because I am a survivor. I'm a survivor.

1120
01:01:41,779 --> 01:01:44,077
Dorothy Boyd...

1121
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:47,675
you are with the lord of the living room...

1122
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:53,417
the king... of the Kingdome, and I am...

1123
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,458
drunk.

1124
01:02:07,738 --> 01:02:09,638
We meet again.

1125
01:02:24,054 --> 01:02:25,282
Here.

1126
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:36,121
The truth?

1127
01:02:38,235 --> 01:02:39,224
- Sure.

1128
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:43,341
- I care about the job...of course...

1129
01:02:43,374 --> 01:02:46,969
but mostly I just wanna be inspired.

1130
01:02:48,846 --> 01:02:49,904
Me too.

1131
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,515
What you wrote inspired me.

1132
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:55,380
No

1133
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:58,555
I'm working with you because of that memo.

1134
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:02,893
I loved that memo.

1135
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:08,163
It was a mission statement.

1136
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:24,240
Well.

1137
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:26,682
Sorry about the hand.

1138
01:03:30,921 --> 01:03:33,890
Do you know that feeling...

1139
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,425
you're not...

1140
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:41,257
completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpse... tomorrow's embarrassment?

1141
01:03:41,298 --> 01:03:43,858
Don't worry about it, boss.

1142
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:47,362
Oh, shit. You said "boss."

1143
01:03:47,438 --> 01:03:49,235
Yeah, I did.

1144
01:03:49,306 --> 01:03:50,500
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

1145
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:53,270
Don't feel like Clarence Thomas.

1146
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:58,182
I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm, like, harassing you right now.

1147
01:03:58,983 --> 01:04:00,575
Well, I may not sue.

1148
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:14,596
Good evening.

1149
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:15,890
Good evening.

1150
01:04:18,702 --> 01:04:21,933
Look, don't worry, okay? I mean, don't...

1151
01:04:24,008 --> 01:04:25,134
We're gonna be okay...

1152
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,939
because I am gonna take my one client...

1153
01:04:29,013 --> 01:04:32,244
and we are gonna go all the way.

1154
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,549
'Cause, hey... I'm back.

1155
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:41,786
Don't worry.

1156
01:04:57,307 --> 01:04:59,867
Way to go, Rod. Good catch, man. Good catch.

1157
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:05,016
All right. Good job.

1158
01:05:07,985 --> 01:05:10,044
We gotta talk about his contract, Dennis.

1159
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:12,847
Meet me at the Crocodile, 8:00.

1160
01:05:14,058 --> 01:05:15,286
You bet.

1161
01:05:35,646 --> 01:05:36,908
Thank you.

1162
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,882
Tell me you got lost last night, because I know you wouldn't do that to a friend.

1163
01:05:40,951 --> 01:05:42,282
- Something came up. - Well, it's okay.

1164
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:45,022
- Ten million dollars for four years. - It's early.

1165
01:05:45,022 --> 01:05:46,614
- You're still dreaming.

1166
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:47,987
- Ten for four, it's a deal.

1167
01:05:48,058 --> 01:05:52,096
The guy has got an attitude problem.

1168
01:05:52,096 --> 01:05:55,088
He listens to me. I can help you with that.

1169
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:56,325
He's a shrimp.

1170
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,767
Shrimp? Rod Tidwell broke every receiving record you had last year.

1171
01:05:59,837 --> 01:06:02,203
I want a prototypical wide receiver,

1172
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:04,035
somebody who's 6'3", 220...

1173
01:06:04,108 --> 01:06:07,339
not some guy who's 5'10" and bitches in the locker room.

1174
01:06:07,411 --> 01:06:10,437
I'm asking you...

1175
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:13,845
for a favor.

1176
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:16,378
I introduced you to your wife.

1177
01:06:16,453 --> 01:06:21,692
We've spent Christmases together. Holiday cheer, Dennis.

1178
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:23,319
Jerry, you're reaching.

1179
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,157
I'm asking you for a favor!

1180
01:06:26,363 --> 01:06:28,854
Don't do this to me. We have history, Dennis.

1181
01:06:28,932 --> 01:06:30,991
We got history, all right.

1182
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:33,901
You drove the prices up on me for years.

1183
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:36,735
Now it's your turn to spend some time at the back of the line.

1184
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:39,810
Dennis, don't...

1185
01:06:43,981 --> 01:06:47,542
I started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotiation this morning.

1186
01:06:52,589 --> 01:06:53,453
Talking?

1187
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:58,562
Jerry Rice. Andre Reed. Chris Carter.

1188
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:00,325
- I smoke all these fools! - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1189
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:03,956
Yet they are makin' the big, sweet dollar.

1190
01:07:04,034 --> 01:07:06,093
They are makin' the kwan.

1191
01:07:06,703 --> 01:07:08,568
And you're talkin'.

1192
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:14,407
Kwan? That's your word?

1193
01:07:14,478 --> 01:07:16,070
Hell, yeah, that's my word.

1194
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:19,912
Some dudes might have the coin, but they'll never have the kwan.

1195
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,512
What is...

1196
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:24,019
It means love, respect...

1197
01:07:24,288 --> 01:07:27,189
community, and the dollars too... the entire package.

1198
01:07:27,257 --> 01:07:29,987
The kwan.

1199
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:32,593
Great word.

1200
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:35,592
Towel?

1201
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,293
No, I air dry.

1202
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:40,162
Listen, Rod.

1203
01:07:40,804 --> 01:07:44,708
I say this with great respect for you...

1204
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:48,008
but those players you mentioned, Rod...

1205
01:07:48,078 --> 01:07:49,636
they're marquee players...

1206
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:53,513
and this deal...

1207
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:55,142
- You know, we... - Marquee?

1208
01:07:55,285 --> 01:07:57,981
Here's what I'm saying. This is a renegotiation.

1209
01:07:58,055 --> 01:08:00,080
We want more from them, so let's give them more.

1210
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:05,729
Let's show them your pure joy of the game. Let's bury the attitude a little bit and show them...

1211
01:08:05,729 --> 01:08:06,559
Wait.

1212
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:09,121
- You're telling me to dance. - No.

1213
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:11,969
I'm saying

1214
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:15,539
to get back to the guy...who first started playing this game.

1215
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:20,568
Remember way back when, when you were a kid? It wasn't just about the money, was it?

1216
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:23,307
Was it?

1217
01:08:24,615 --> 01:08:25,980
Was it?

1218
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:29,012
Do your job.

1219
01:08:29,553 --> 01:08:31,521
Don't you tell me to dance.

1220
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:33,715
Fine. Fine!

1221
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,351
I am an athlete. I am not an entertainer!

1222
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:38,325
- Fine!

1223
01:08:38,395 --> 01:08:40,158
- These are the ABC's of me, baby.

1224
01:08:40,397 --> 01:08:44,265
I do not dance, and I do not start preseason without a contract.

1225
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:46,700
Fine! Fine! Fine!

1226
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,169
Jerry, talk to me.

1227
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:50,597
Breathe.

1228
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:52,073
Breathe, Jerry.

1229
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:57,006
I am out here for you.

1230
01:08:57,547 --> 01:09:00,778
You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you.

1231
01:09:00,851 --> 01:09:05,220
It is an up-at-dawn, pride-swallowing siege...

1232
01:09:05,289 --> 01:09:08,417
that I will never fully tell you about, okay?

1233
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:13,993
Just... God, help me!

1234
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:15,926
Help me, Rod.

1235
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:18,126
Help me help you.

1236
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:22,436
Help me help you.

1237
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,703
Help me help you.

1238
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:34,778
I'm sorry.

1239
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:39,553
You are hanging on by a very thin thread.

1240
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:43,588
I dig that about you!

1241
01:09:45,162 --> 01:09:46,060
No contract?

1242
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:48,825
"Help me, help me!"

1243
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:52,266
That's my man!

1244
01:09:53,003 --> 01:09:54,595
Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

1245
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:57,105
Help me! Help me!

1246
01:09:58,408 --> 01:09:59,773
I'll see you in Los Angeles.

1247
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:02,141
Come on, man.

1248
01:10:03,313 --> 01:10:06,305
Hey, see, that's the difference between us.

1249
01:10:06,383 --> 01:10:09,580
You think we're fightin', and I think we're finally talkin'.

1250
01:10:14,825 --> 01:10:16,918
Unless you love everybody,

1251
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:19,086
you can't sell anybody.

1252
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,629
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say...

1253
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:33,369
he's faxing in the new offer for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

1254
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:35,843
And he said you'd be happy. Glad.

1255
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:37,971
Did he say "happy" or "glad"?

1256
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:41,512
Glad. He said glad. Glad.

1257
01:10:43,253 --> 01:10:45,517
Glad is good.

1258
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:48,183
- Glad's good. - We could sure use that commission.

1259
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:51,750
Here, I did a rundown on where you stand financially.

1260
01:10:55,165 --> 01:10:57,224
I sunk most of what I had into this condo.

1261
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,495
- You don't have to explain. - It devalued and...

1262
01:11:01,037 --> 01:11:03,198
Look, the other night...

1263
01:11:03,273 --> 01:11:04,831
I want to apologize.

1264
01:11:05,442 --> 01:11:07,000
Yeah, what happened there?

1265
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:10,308
We're two people working together. We can't have atmosphere.

1266
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:13,072
No, I'm really relieved that you said that.

1267
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:16,642
The other night, I was lonely...

1268
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,018
and I felt you understood something.

1269
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:22,987
- But we've got a company to think about. - Yes.

1270
01:11:23,126 --> 01:11:26,254
I will never take advantage of you in that way again.

1271
01:11:26,496 --> 01:11:27,155
- Good.

1272
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:32,134
- You walked out on a job for me. This is how I repay you? Can this be right?

1273
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:34,260
Exactly.

1274
01:11:35,539 --> 01:11:39,669
This is one of those times when you need to be alone with your thoughts...

1275
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:43,235
and think about everything that's gone wrong and how to fix it...

1276
01:11:43,313 --> 01:11:45,338
and, you know, just be alone.

1277
01:11:46,016 --> 01:11:47,381
Alone. Alone, alone, alone.

1278
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:52,318
Alone.

1279
01:11:53,824 --> 01:11:55,018
- You wanna go out to dinner?

1280
01:11:55,091 --> 01:11:57,423
- I know a great place.

1281
01:11:57,794 --> 01:12:02,466
The guy's an utter loser, so I broke up with him. Then he started stalking me.

1282
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:04,593
What's the current definition of stalking?

1283
01:12:04,668 --> 01:12:06,499
Coming over uninvited.

1284
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:11,138
Coming over uninvited. So Romeo under the balcony is a stalker?

1285
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,540
- Exactly. - Oh, stop!

1286
01:12:20,652 --> 01:12:23,817
Excuse me.

1287
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,548
Ladies? Ladies?

1288
01:12:26,756 --> 01:12:27,745
Good evening.

1289
01:12:28,725 --> 01:12:30,989
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

1290
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:33,626
She's in the kitchen.

1291
01:12:34,297 --> 01:12:35,093
- Laurel.

1292
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:36,096
- Jerry. Hi.

1293
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:39,666
So where are you taking her tonight?

1294
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:42,464
You're the nanny?

1295
01:12:43,173 --> 01:12:43,969
- Au pair.

1296
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,837
- Au pair, is it?

1297
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:48,637
Jerry

1298
01:12:51,414 --> 01:12:52,642
He likes you.

1299
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:57,412
My goodness. Look, I got some gifts for you.

1300
01:12:58,088 --> 01:13:00,352
Do you like presents? Good. All right.

1301
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:06,629
Here's the Arizona Cardinals. It's the team that Rod plays for.

1302
01:13:06,663 --> 01:13:08,528
Dropping your laundry off?

1303
01:13:08,598 --> 01:13:10,122
- Would you like a hat? Steelers?

1304
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,189
- For me? Wow.

1305
01:13:11,268 --> 01:13:12,792
Got some things.

1306
01:13:12,969 --> 01:13:14,300
Got it in gray too.

1307
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,174
Thanks, Jerry.

1308
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:19,735
You're very welcome. Oh, my goodness. Look what I've got here.

1309
01:13:19,776 --> 01:13:22,438
This is an energy bar. This will keep you up all night.

1310
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:26,073
See, that's not a good idea. I'll take that, yeah.

1311
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:27,616
Aunt Laurel will eat that for you.

1312
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:32,483
Looks like you've got a fan.

1313
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:39,563
Wow. That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

1314
01:13:39,563 --> 01:13:43,932
I guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults.

1315
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,365
- No offense, buddy. -

1316
01:13:45,435 --> 01:13:47,198
Jerry, did you meet Chad? - Chad, Jerry. Jerry, Chad.

1317
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,534
- Yeah, we did. Am I dressed okay?

1318
01:13:49,606 --> 01:13:50,698
I didn't realize...

1319
01:13:54,945 --> 01:13:56,936
Chad, don't let him stay up too late.

1320
01:13:57,013 --> 01:13:58,446
Tonight

1321
01:13:58,515 --> 01:14:02,076
I'm going to teach Ray here about jazz.

1322
01:14:02,152 --> 01:14:04,382
Good. That'll put him to sleep early.

1323
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:07,079
- I wanna go too.

1324
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:11,561
- Oh, no, sweetheart. You stay here with Chad, okay, and be good?

1325
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:13,119
Give me a kiss.

1326
01:14:14,397 --> 01:14:16,701
- Let's go. - Excuse me.

1327
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:19,732
Okay. Good night. Good night.

1328
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:21,703
Give me a hug.

1329
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:06,284
Go ahead. I'll meet you at the car.

1330
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:09,151
- Okay. - Just forgot the keys. No big deal.

1331
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:14,323
That is the first time I have ever seen him kiss a man just like a dad.

1332
01:15:14,557 --> 01:15:16,252
- Wasn't that just thrilling?

1333
01:15:16,326 --> 01:15:17,122
- Yeah, it was.

1334
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:19,218
- He must really have needed that. - Take it easy.

1335
01:15:19,295 --> 01:15:20,785
Don't cry at the beginning of a date.

1336
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:22,456
Cry at the end, like I do.

1337
01:15:22,632 --> 01:15:24,224
- You all right? - Okay.

1338
01:15:24,634 --> 01:15:27,535
Don't be a shoulder for him to cry on. That's all I'm gonna say. Nothing else.

1339
01:15:27,604 --> 01:15:28,263
Okey

1340
01:15:28,338 --> 01:15:30,806
- Keys, keys. - Oh, keys. Okay.

1341
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:33,899
Oh, dear.

1342
01:15:59,736 --> 01:16:02,728
Ever since you've met me, I've been...

1343
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:11,244
It was laziness, you know... my breakup with Avery.

1344
01:16:11,314 --> 01:16:13,874
You say, "It's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right?

1345
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:17,887
Somebody is always to blame.

1346
01:16:17,887 --> 01:16:20,048
You go for it like you do a job.

1347
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:21,921
Work at it.

1348
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:26,628
But maybe love shouldn't be such hard work.

1349
01:16:27,597 --> 01:16:30,964
Yeah, maybe so.

1350
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:36,131
It's not every day you say good-bye to a woman like that.

1351
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,736
A song for the lovers?

1352
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:41,003
No, thank you.

1353
01:16:41,077 --> 01:16:42,704
No,

1354
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:43,973
we work together.

1355
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,445
Really, guys, this is like an office meeting, but thank you.

1356
01:16:47,884 --> 01:16:49,146
But I know what you mean.

1357
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:55,722
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was any good, even before...

1358
01:16:58,228 --> 01:16:59,320
Before?

1359
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:03,020
Jerry

1360
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:04,555
What?

1361
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:07,865
Let's not tell our sad stories.

1362
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:15,842
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

1363
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:47,173
- I realize you're seeing someone new - They sting.

1364
01:17:47,243 --> 01:17:49,871
Let Chad catch the bee in the glass.

1365
01:17:49,946 --> 01:17:51,208
No, he won't hurt him.

1366
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:52,270
I love you.

1367
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:55,112
You've got such a good heart, buddy. I love you.

1368
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,916
Your temperamental, moody side

1369
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:01,288
The one you've always tried to hide from me

1370
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:25,843
Well, this would be good night.

1371
01:18:27,283 --> 01:18:28,580
Good night.

1372
01:18:29,652 --> 01:18:31,017
- I'll see you tomorrow. - I'll see you tomorrow.

1373
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:32,384
Big day.

1374
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,112
Well, good night.

1375
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:02,950
Good night.

1376
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:36,547
Oops.

1377
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:42,723
Let me fix this.

1378
01:19:42,959 --> 01:19:44,586
Good idea.

1379
01:20:39,349 --> 01:20:41,374
I think you should not come in.

1380
01:20:43,486 --> 01:20:44,714
Or

1381
01:20:44,854 --> 01:20:45,843
come in.

1382
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:50,518
Depending on how you feel.

1383
01:20:51,928 --> 01:20:53,623
- Same to you. - No.

1384
01:20:53,696 --> 01:20:58,468
I have to go in.

1385
01:20:59,369 --> 01:21:01,098
I live here.

1386
01:21:09,512 --> 01:21:10,706
Right.

1387
01:21:15,385 --> 01:21:16,943
I'll come in.

1388
01:21:19,322 --> 01:21:20,311
Good.

1389
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:32,363
Are you sure we wanna do this?

1390
01:21:36,906 --> 01:21:38,533
- Oh, hell, yes. - Yeah.

1391
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:50,208
How is he? Did he have a good night?

1392
01:21:50,286 --> 01:21:52,049
- Yeah, he's asleep. - Good.

1393
01:21:52,121 --> 01:21:54,146
- How'd it go with sport boy?

1394
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:55,986
- Still going.

1395
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,528
All right.

1396
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:06,102
How are you?

1397
01:22:09,272 --> 01:22:10,705
Treat her right.

1398
01:22:11,674 --> 01:22:12,663
- Yeah. - She's...

1399
01:22:15,078 --> 01:22:15,874
- She's great. - Yeah.

1400
01:22:18,948 --> 01:22:20,540
And...

1401
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:24,085
I know this might be a little awkward, but

1402
01:22:25,421 --> 01:22:26,718
I want you to use this.

1403
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:29,418
Oh, look. God, Chad.

1404
01:22:29,492 --> 01:22:30,891
No

1405
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,154
This is Miles Davis...

1406
01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:35,963
and John Coltrane.

1407
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:39,029
Stockholm, 1963.

1408
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:41,127
Two masters of freedom playing at a time...

1409
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:47,200
before their art was corrupted... by a zillion cocktail lounge performers...

1410
01:22:47,243 --> 01:22:52,010
who destroyed the legacy of the only American art form...

1411
01:22:54,217 --> 01:22:55,775
jazz.

1412
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,045
I put some Mingus on there too.

1413
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:09,692
No barriers,

1414
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:10,891
no boundaries.

1415
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,430
Chad, I got it.

1416
01:23:46,569 --> 01:23:47,763
Come here.

1417
01:24:06,589 --> 01:24:09,422
You know this is gonna change everything.

1418
01:24:13,095 --> 01:24:14,756
Promise?

1419
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,268
What is this music?

1420
01:24:57,807 --> 01:24:59,775
I love getting up in the morning!

1421
01:24:59,842 --> 01:25:03,710
I clap my hands and say, "This is gonna be a great day!"

1422
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:07,612
Great.

1423
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,480
You really needed to do this.

1424
01:25:23,566 --> 01:25:25,397
I'm getting him up, so don't worry.

1425
01:25:26,402 --> 01:25:29,838
What? I'm just waiting for the coffee. I don't care...

1426
01:25:30,606 --> 01:25:31,903
- Just tell me one thing.

1427
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:33,202
- No.

1428
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:38,631
- Why are you acting like that? - Because I'm worried. You're putting

1429
01:25:38,631 --> 01:25:41,550
faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going...

1430
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,745
might not have an emotional marble in his head.

1431
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:45,844
Laurel, please, if I start talking...

1432
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:46,751
- You, please.

1433
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:50,059
- What does that make me, Laurel...for taking the opportunity?

1434
01:25:50,059 --> 01:25:53,460
Men are just different people when they're hanging on to the bottom rung.

1435
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:55,554
Maybe I am taking advantage.

1436
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:57,531
Does that make me a bad person? Huh?

1437
01:25:58,968 --> 01:26:04,835
All I know is I found someone, and he was popular and charming and not so nice to me, and he died, okay?

1438
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,865
So why should I let this guy go

1439
01:26:06,942 --> 01:26:09,103
when everything in my body says...

1440
01:26:09,178 --> 01:26:11,840
that this one is the one.

1441
01:26:11,914 --> 01:26:14,906
Take it easy, all right? I was just looking for a few fun details.

1442
01:26:15,551 --> 01:26:17,849
Well, why didn't you say so?

1443
01:26:18,888 --> 01:26:22,051
Well, I don't know if you're interested in this one little detail.

1444
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:23,182
Yeah, what?

1445
01:26:23,259 --> 01:26:25,420
I was just about to tell you...

1446
01:26:27,496 --> 01:26:29,589
that I love him.

1447
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:32,261
I do!

1448
01:26:32,335 --> 01:26:34,098
I love him.

1449
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:35,728
I love him, and I don't care what you think.

1450
01:26:35,805 --> 01:26:39,036
I love him for the man he wants to be...

1451
01:26:39,108 --> 01:26:42,441
and I love him for the man that he almost is.

1452
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:44,648
I love him, Laurel.

1453
01:26:44,648 --> 01:26:47,483
I love him. I love him.

1454
01:26:47,483 --> 01:26:49,246
Hi, Jerry.

1455
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:53,477
Act natural.

1456
01:26:59,228 --> 01:27:00,695
Tell me he's not there.

1457
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,321
He's not there.

1458
01:27:02,698 --> 01:27:04,461
Oh, God.

1459
01:27:04,934 --> 01:27:06,595
- Easy, ladies, easy.

1460
01:27:07,169 --> 01:27:08,158
- Coffee, Jerry?

1461
01:27:08,738 --> 01:27:12,435
No, thanks. We bottom feeders, we prefer cereal first.

1462
01:27:13,776 --> 01:27:15,710
Let's have AppleJacks.

1463
01:27:15,778 --> 01:27:18,338
AppleJacks? AppleJacks it is.

1464
01:27:20,883 --> 01:27:22,510
Good morning, darling.

1465
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:26,818
Morning.

1466
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:28,517
What's going on, Jerry?

1467
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:31,685
A lot, actually. We've got a big fax today.

1468
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:33,852
We need this commission.

1469
01:27:34,163 --> 01:27:36,324
Need this commission. Milk?

1470
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:39,561
Cheers.

1471
01:27:47,376 --> 01:27:49,708
That was really great of you this morning.

1472
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:56,442
Look, let's just root for a big offer... so we can move out of this room...

1473
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:58,553
and into a real office.

1474
01:27:59,388 --> 01:28:00,480
Would you mind?

1475
01:28:00,556 --> 01:28:01,989
Thanks a lot.

1476
01:28:06,162 --> 01:28:09,029


1477
01:28:10,266 --> 01:28:11,699
Shit.

1478
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:15,238
You know, it's just...

1479
01:28:17,807 --> 01:28:20,503
1.7 for three years?

1480
01:28:20,943 --> 01:28:22,376
- Man, we owe more than that! - It's okay.

1481
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:25,380
This is how the game is played. Now I'm gonna go back to them.

1482
01:28:25,448 --> 01:28:28,383
And say what? " Please remove your dick from my ass"?

1483
01:28:28,451 --> 01:28:29,110
- Marcee.

1484
01:28:29,185 --> 01:28:31,244
- I'm just a little pregnant right now.

1485
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,685
That's okay.

1486
01:28:32,755 --> 01:28:34,552
I feel like crying, Jerry. I feel like bustin' the room up.

1487
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:36,818
Rod, let's not take this emotionally.

1488
01:28:36,892 --> 01:28:40,956
We're gonna roll with this problem, okay?

1489
01:28:41,163 --> 01:28:42,687
What are you so calm about?

1490
01:28:42,798 --> 01:28:46,598
What do you mean, "roll with this problem"? Don't take it emotionally?

1491
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:49,365
You ask me, you haven't gotten emotional enough over this man!

1492
01:28:49,438 --> 01:28:50,666
- I disagree.

1493
01:28:50,739 --> 01:28:52,604
- Somebody get Bob Sugar on the phone.

1494
01:28:55,811 --> 01:28:56,709
You wanna leave me?

1495
01:28:56,779 --> 01:29:00,943
A lot of agents say a lot of shit. So what do you stand for?

1496
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,143
- You wanna leave me? - What do you stand for?

1497
01:29:03,219 --> 01:29:05,414
How about a little piece of integrity in this world...

1498
01:29:05,488 --> 01:29:10,257
so full of greed and lack of honor that I don't know what to tell my son...

1499
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:14,288
except, " Here, have a look at a guy who isn't yelling, 'Show me the money!"'

1500
01:29:15,064 --> 01:29:16,622
You know he's broke?

1501
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:20,430
He is broke and working for you for free.

1502
01:29:21,203 --> 01:29:23,899
Broke.

1503
01:29:25,241 --> 01:29:27,971
I'm sorry. I'm just not as good at the insults as she is.

1504
01:29:28,143 --> 01:29:29,940
No, that was pretty good.

1505
01:29:30,012 --> 01:29:31,001
No shit.

1506
01:29:33,148 --> 01:29:35,378
Let me show you something.

1507
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:41,783
Here.Rod, read this.

1508
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:43,050
No

1509
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:48,692
I just think that... Jerry, I think it's important.

1510
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:50,732
That came from your heart and you shouldn't deny it.

1511
01:29:50,799 --> 01:29:53,529
You should be proud of that, and I still think they should read it.

1512
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:54,466
Jerry

1513
01:29:55,204 --> 01:29:56,967
Tell me what to do.

1514
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:00,766
You tell me to eat lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

1515
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:04,611
You tell me this is the best we can get, this is all we can get...

1516
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:05,942
- All we can get?

1517
01:30:06,015 --> 01:30:08,381
- Please, I'm talking with my agent.

1518
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:11,476
Listen, this is what you're gonna do.

1519
01:30:11,554 --> 01:30:14,250
You're gonna reject that shitty contract...

1520
01:30:14,323 --> 01:30:17,053
and play out your existing shitty contract

1521
01:30:17,126 --> 01:30:18,821
and be a free agent next year.

1522
01:30:18,894 --> 01:30:20,327
Come on. Hey.

1523
01:30:20,396 --> 01:30:23,524
Baby, this is us. You and me.

1524
01:30:23,599 --> 01:30:25,464
We determine our worth.

1525
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:27,795
Baby, you are a strong,

1526
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:31,636
proud...surviving, splendid black man.

1527
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:39,215
You are the shit.

1528
01:30:42,953 --> 01:30:45,012
Oh, baby.

1529
01:30:47,056 --> 01:30:49,490
If you get injured, you get zero.

1530
01:30:50,059 --> 01:30:52,254
- Won't happen. I'm strong in mind.

1531
01:30:52,328 --> 01:30:53,124
- That's right.

1532
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:56,893
It's a risk.

1533
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,633
You bet on me like I bet on you.

1534
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:08,174
You know?

1535
01:31:08,243 --> 01:31:10,575
My man! You know?

1536
01:31:11,647 --> 01:31:15,816
You know? You know? Baby?

1537
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:19,754
- Ah, you so crazy. - I love you, baby.

1538
01:31:21,924 --> 01:31:24,154
Let me kiss that head.

1539
01:31:33,769 --> 01:31:35,760
I'm gonna take that job in San Diego.

1540
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:38,236
- Don't even talk about that yet. - You can't afford me.

1541
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:41,232
- I'll find something. - No, you can't afford me, Jerry.

1542
01:31:42,411 --> 01:31:44,003
I'll find something fast for Tidwell.

1543
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:46,775
- I refuse to be a drain. - We'll stay afloat.

1544
01:31:48,317 --> 01:31:50,308
We will stay afloat.

1545
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:52,781
Don't leave.

1546
01:31:52,855 --> 01:31:54,288
- Get on the camel! - You've been on my ass all day.

1547
01:31:54,356 --> 01:31:57,292
I told you to put the camera low, shoot me up from the bottom.

1548
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:59,021
- Make me look more powerful. - Get him on the camel!

1549
01:31:59,094 --> 01:32:01,363
- I'm gonna get him on the camel.

1550
01:32:01,363 --> 01:32:03,126
- You don't need a camel. You have me!

1551
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:04,893
- It's Kammell Chevrolet.

1552
01:32:04,967 --> 01:32:07,663
- You see that? That's how I feel.

1553
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:09,761
Do you hear him? He's feeling my pain.

1554
01:32:09,838 --> 01:32:10,930
- Get on the camel!

1555
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:13,031
- Enough. I'm pulling him from this.

1556
01:32:13,108 --> 01:32:16,178
- Pulling him? - I'm not saying that. Get rid of the camel, and we can get busy with this.

1557
01:32:16,178 --> 01:32:19,113
An athlete of your stature, this isn't what I had in mind.

1558
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:20,910
- You're pulling him? - You're right. Let's bounce.

1559
01:32:22,651 --> 01:32:26,143
Pulling him? Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him!

1560
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,480
I know you needed that commission...

1561
01:32:29,558 --> 01:32:35,564
but we ain't gonna bring Reebok to their knees with no regional Kammell ad. Excuse me, darling.

1562
01:32:35,631 --> 01:32:38,327
Can I ask you a question that's totally unrelated to your career?

1563
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,425
What, we gonna be friends now?

1564
01:32:41,036 --> 01:32:43,231
What do you know about dating a single mother?

1565
01:32:43,706 --> 01:32:45,970
Plenty. I was raised by a single mother.

1566
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,369
Tell me, because I think, after this...

1567
01:32:48,444 --> 01:32:51,038
she's gonna have to take that job in San Diego.

1568
01:32:51,747 --> 01:32:54,181
First of all, single mothers don't date.

1569
01:32:54,249 --> 01:32:55,910
Watch it. Watch this thing.

1570
01:32:56,185 --> 01:33:01,186
They don't date. They've been to the circus. You know what I mean?

1571
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:04,054
They've been to the puppet show, and they've seen the strings.

1572
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,191
- Do you love her?

1573
01:33:06,462 --> 01:33:07,451
- How do I know?

1574
01:33:07,529 --> 01:33:09,793
What do you mean, how do you know? You know when you know.

1575
01:33:10,165 --> 01:33:12,793
I'm feeling a little... I don't want her to go.

1576
01:33:12,868 --> 01:33:13,960
- I've been hanging out at her place.

1577
01:33:14,036 --> 01:33:17,334
- Wait, wait, no. Right there, that's bullshit.

1578
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:19,304
You gotta be fair to her.

1579
01:33:19,374 --> 01:33:22,172
A single mother, man, that's a sacred thing.

1580
01:33:22,344 --> 01:33:24,005
You gotta have the talk.

1581
01:33:25,614 --> 01:33:27,172
She loves you.

1582
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:30,046
If you don't love her, you've got to tell her.

1583
01:33:33,522 --> 01:33:35,080
The kid's amazing.

1584
01:33:36,024 --> 01:33:36,888
He...

1585
01:33:39,561 --> 01:33:42,086
I feel you. I feel you, dog.

1586
01:33:42,531 --> 01:33:46,262
But a real man would not shoplift the pootie from a single mother.

1587
01:33:48,203 --> 01:33:51,604
I didn't shoplift the pootie.

1588
01:33:56,612 --> 01:33:58,045
All right.

1589
01:33:58,881 --> 01:34:01,042
I shoplifted the pootie.

1590
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:15,128
You know... John Coltrane once said to Miles Davis...

1591
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:17,555
When you say good-bye to him, don't make a big, dramatic thing out of it.

1592
01:34:17,633 --> 01:34:20,500
Just be cool. What's meant to be will be.

1593
01:34:20,936 --> 01:34:22,904
You'll still see each other. What about me?

1594
01:34:22,971 --> 01:34:25,064
I'm losing the only person that listens to me,

1595
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:26,402
and you only listen partially.

1596
01:34:26,475 --> 01:34:28,534
No, quit making me laugh. Come on.

1597
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:33,715
You're doing the right thing. You need to start your life. He needs a warm body to cushion the fall.

1598
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:36,081
Check out exhibit "A" on the front lawn. Look at that.

1599
01:34:39,254 --> 01:34:41,222
I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.

1600
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:42,279
- Good-bye.

1601
01:34:43,158 --> 01:34:44,819
- Yeah, good-bye.

1602
01:34:47,763 --> 01:34:48,422
Bye.

1603
01:34:56,205 --> 01:34:59,140
Listen, you're gonna like it in San Diego, Ray.

1604
01:35:04,046 --> 01:35:06,310
It's gonna be great there because...

1605
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:08,349
you'll make a lot of friends.

1606
01:35:09,451 --> 01:35:11,715
I'm gonna see you this weekend, you know?

1607
01:35:11,787 --> 01:35:13,755
Go ahead and go.

1608
01:35:19,328 --> 01:35:21,626
Go ahead and go.

1609
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,576
Are you sure you're okay to drive this?

1610
01:35:34,643 --> 01:35:36,668
This rig? No problem.

1611
01:35:36,745 --> 01:35:38,337
I'll see you this weekend.

1612
01:35:38,614 --> 01:35:40,047
Get in the car.

1613
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:42,174
Get in the car, Dorothy.

1614
01:35:42,251 --> 01:35:44,082
I'll see you in a couple of days, yeah.

1615
01:35:44,152 --> 01:35:48,123
I love you.

1616
01:35:48,123 --> 01:35:49,750
I love you too, you know?

1617
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:52,849
- What?

1618
01:35:52,928 --> 01:35:53,986
- Nothing.

1619
01:35:54,196 --> 01:35:55,857
- I'll see you soon. - Okay.

1620
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:58,860
Look...

1621
01:35:59,268 --> 01:36:02,066
if this weekend should turn into next month...

1622
01:36:02,137 --> 01:36:04,833
and next month should turn into whatever...

1623
01:36:05,107 --> 01:36:06,870
don't make a joke of your life.

1624
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:10,901
Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of'em.

1625
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:13,914
You're better than the Bob Sugars.

1626
01:36:15,284 --> 01:36:16,615
Don't forget that.

1627
01:36:33,735 --> 01:36:35,635
Wait. Wait a second.

1628
01:36:35,704 --> 01:36:37,569
No, no. Oh, God.

1629
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:42,401
I know a way we can save on medical and rent.

1630
01:36:42,477 --> 01:36:44,308
No, don't listen to him.

1631
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:46,176
What if we stayed together?

1632
01:36:47,182 --> 01:36:48,240
What if we got married?

1633
01:36:49,284 --> 01:36:50,808
If I said that, would you stay?

1634
01:36:50,886 --> 01:36:53,115
Don't do that.

1635
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:55,020
Don't say that unless...

1636
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:57,690
Well, say it if you want to.

1637
01:37:03,598 --> 01:37:04,394
Will you marry me?

1638
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,768
What are you thinkin'?

1639
01:37:45,841 --> 01:37:47,468
Laurel.

1640
01:37:48,143 --> 01:37:49,940
We're getting married.

1641
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:55,644
Do you, Jerry Maguire, take this woman... to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1642
01:37:56,752 --> 01:37:57,878
No, not yet.

1643
01:37:57,953 --> 01:37:59,887
- And do you, Dorothy Boyd... - Not now.

1644
01:37:59,955 --> 01:38:02,617
Take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?

1645
01:38:04,826 --> 01:38:05,815
Almost.

1646
01:38:05,894 --> 01:38:08,692
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1647
01:38:08,764 --> 01:38:10,493
- Okay, sweetheart. - Oh, yeah.

1648
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,438
Mother, mother

1649
01:38:22,044 --> 01:38:25,377
There's too many of you crying

1650
01:38:28,116 --> 01:38:30,380
Brother, brother, brother

1651
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,114
Far too many of you dying

1652
01:38:36,124 --> 01:38:39,525
you know we've got to find a way

1653
01:38:40,929 --> 01:38:44,922
To bring some loving here today

1654
01:38:45,268 --> 01:38:46,360
yeah

1655
01:38:46,436 --> 01:38:48,734
Picket lines, sister

1656
01:38:48,805 --> 01:38:50,966
- And picket signs, sister - I should go.

1657
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:54,499
Don't punish me through brutality

1658
01:38:54,543 --> 01:38:57,205
Come on, brother! Come on and talk to me, brother!

1659
01:38:58,014 --> 01:38:59,948
'Cause you can see

1660
01:39:00,016 --> 01:39:02,814
- Oh, what's going on - What's going on

1661
01:39:02,886 --> 01:39:05,184
- What's going on - What's going on

1662
01:39:11,426 --> 01:39:12,688
We did it.

1663
01:39:14,763 --> 01:39:15,821
We sure did.

1664
01:39:36,051 --> 01:39:38,076
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

1665
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:47,286
I'm glad we had this talk.

1666
01:39:49,631 --> 01:39:51,622
Oh, look at them.

1667
01:39:54,002 --> 01:39:55,993
She is so beautiful.

1668
01:40:09,286 --> 01:40:13,086
Lfigure you two will have lots of kids.

1669
01:40:13,121 --> 01:40:16,386
I do not believe they have this on tape.

1670
01:40:17,627 --> 01:40:19,561
That's my bro.

1671
01:40:20,897 --> 01:40:22,831
Mother, mother

1672
01:40:23,298 --> 01:40:26,495
See, now, I'm gonna release this to ESPN.

1673
01:40:28,703 --> 01:40:32,174
You think I'm joking. It's all right. I know where you live.

1674
01:40:32,174 --> 01:40:36,572
Far too many of you crying

1675
01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:39,342
You didn't have the talk, did you?

1676
01:40:42,651 --> 01:40:43,640
To bring some loving No

1677
01:40:44,786 --> 01:40:47,983
Well, this definitely was another way to go.

1678
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:53,159
Hey, Dorothy, come here.

1679
01:40:53,228 --> 01:40:56,629
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Maguire!

1680
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:58,567
We're gonna have a great season!

1681
01:40:58,567 --> 01:41:00,000
We're gonna have a great season!

1682
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:11,504
Hey, Scotty. Tidwell, 4 for 36.

1683
01:41:14,616 --> 01:41:16,607
Jerry  Dennis

1684
01:41:16,885 --> 01:41:18,614
- He's having a good game...

1685
01:41:18,687 --> 01:41:19,449
- You bet he is. So far.

1686
01:41:19,521 --> 01:41:20,818
- You're gonna miss him next year.

1687
01:41:21,356 --> 01:41:23,415


1688
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:27,289
Everyone's been kind to me, and I've been fortunate enough to slip right in.

1689
01:41:27,329 --> 01:41:29,524
I've got a great team behind me, and I'm loving it. I'm loving life.

1690
01:41:29,598 --> 01:41:31,327


1691
01:41:38,006 --> 01:41:39,837
That's my mo-fo!

1692
01:41:41,343 --> 01:41:42,332
Come here.

1693
01:41:44,112 --> 01:41:45,739
Come here.

1694
01:41:45,814 --> 01:41:49,477
Why don't you be the first man in your family not to use that word?

1695
01:41:49,551 --> 01:41:52,384
And then we'll let you live. Now go kiss Daddy, quick.

1696
01:41:56,558 --> 01:41:57,684
Come on, now.

1697
01:41:58,526 --> 01:42:00,460
Come on, Rod!

1698
01:42:03,965 --> 01:42:06,866
I saw you limping a little bit after the first quarter.

1699
01:42:06,935 --> 01:42:08,926
- What happened? - Yeah, I dropped my...

1700
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:13,072
I sprained my ankle on the ice out there. It was cold.

1701
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:14,937
It was kind of slick. Twisted my ankle.

1702
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:16,939
All right. Thanks.

1703
01:42:17,245 --> 01:42:20,578
That went well. Anybody else here worth talking to?

1704
01:42:21,349 --> 01:42:23,647
All right. Let's get out of here.

1705
01:42:25,387 --> 01:42:26,376
- How's your head?

1706
01:42:26,454 --> 01:42:28,081
- Bubblicious.

1707
01:42:28,156 --> 01:42:29,521
- Can you sign this?

1708
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:30,853
- How are you?

1709
01:42:31,926 --> 01:42:33,188
- How are you doing, man?

1710
01:42:33,261 --> 01:42:34,523
- Hanging in there.

1711
01:42:34,596 --> 01:42:36,154
- Good game. - Tough one out there.

1712
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:40,457
- Quarterback sucks, man. - Thanks, man.

1713
01:42:41,236 --> 01:42:42,999
Gonna get me killed.

1714
01:42:43,071 --> 01:42:45,471
He was throwing high and across the middle.

1715
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,973
I'm worried. I'm worried the only reason why...

1716
01:42:47,042 --> 01:42:49,169
I'm getting my brains blown loose is 'cause you weren't asshole enough...

1717
01:42:49,244 --> 01:42:52,881
to get me my ten million three fucking months ago.

1718
01:42:53,248 --> 01:42:54,772
Shit.

1719
01:42:56,318 --> 01:42:58,946
You take care of yourself out on that field, you hear?

1720
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,851
- You're my entire client roster.

1721
01:43:00,922 --> 01:43:02,389
- Don't I know this.

1722
01:43:03,224 --> 01:43:05,124
Now go home to your wife.

1723
01:43:05,493 --> 01:43:06,585
- What's that supposed to mean? - What are you doing here?

1724
01:43:06,661 --> 01:43:09,664
You could've told me this shit over the phone.

1725
01:43:09,664 --> 01:43:13,327
How about dedication for an answer?

1726
01:43:13,401 --> 01:43:15,301
How about personal attention?You don't want to go home, do you?

1727
01:43:15,704 --> 01:43:16,864
- What are you saying?

1728
01:43:16,938 --> 01:43:18,963
- I'm just trying to talk to you.

1729
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,598
How's your marriage?

1730
01:43:21,509 --> 01:43:24,103
You know, the husband and wife thing? How is that?

1731
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,184
Not everyone has what you have.

1732
01:43:34,889 --> 01:43:36,720
Then why did you get married?

1733
01:43:37,525 --> 01:43:39,516
- I'm just asking as a friend.

1734
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:40,788
- You want an answer?

1735
01:43:41,696 --> 01:43:43,493
Loyalty.

1736
01:43:44,432 --> 01:43:46,059
She was loyal.

1737
01:43:50,538 --> 01:43:51,800
I mean, you know, everything...

1738
01:43:51,873 --> 01:43:55,343
grew from there.

1739
01:43:55,343 --> 01:43:57,243
It just...

1740
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:00,041
grew from there.

1741
01:44:01,049 --> 01:44:03,142
That's an answer.

1742
01:44:03,685 --> 01:44:05,380
That's the answer.

1743
01:44:05,687 --> 01:44:07,780
It's not sexy.

1744
01:44:08,823 --> 01:44:10,654
Shit. That's an answer.

1745
01:44:10,725 --> 01:44:12,420
Tell him what he's won, Bob!

1746
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:15,054
A beautiful marriage!

1747
01:44:15,663 --> 01:44:17,460
Shit!

1748
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:21,997
Well... I'm happy to entertain you, as always, Rod.

1749
01:44:24,005 --> 01:44:28,309
Shit. I have a question for you, Rod.

1750
01:44:28,309 --> 01:44:30,106
- Are we really friends? - Why not?

1751
01:44:30,178 --> 01:44:33,238
Because friends can tell each other anything...

1752
01:44:33,314 --> 01:44:35,145
if we have our "friends hats" on, right?

1753
01:44:35,216 --> 01:44:36,547
- Yeah, I think so. - All right.

1754
01:44:36,618 --> 01:44:40,987
I'll tell you why you don't have your $10 million yet.

1755
01:44:41,623 --> 01:44:44,615
Right now, you are a paycheck player.

1756
01:44:44,692 --> 01:44:46,819
You play with your head, not your heart.

1757
01:44:46,895 --> 01:44:49,261
In your personal life, heart.

1758
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:52,788
But when you get on the field, it's all about what you didn't get...

1759
01:44:52,867 --> 01:44:55,563
who's to blame, who under-threw the pass...

1760
01:44:55,637 --> 01:44:58,663
who's got the contract you don't, who's not giving you your love.

1761
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:02,699
You know what? That is not what inspires people.

1762
01:45:02,777 --> 01:45:04,506
That is not what inspires people.

1763
01:45:05,113 --> 01:45:09,311
Just shut up. Play the game. Play it from your heart.

1764
01:45:09,384 --> 01:45:11,545
And you know what? I will show you the kwan.

1765
01:45:11,619 --> 01:45:15,020
And that's the truth, man. That's the truth. Can you handle it?

1766
01:45:15,089 --> 01:45:17,250
It's just a question between friends.

1767
01:45:17,325 --> 01:45:17,984
You know?

1768
01:45:21,229 --> 01:45:24,665
And when they call you shrimp, I'm the one who defends you!

1769
01:45:25,266 --> 01:45:26,824
- I don't want to be friends no more.

1770
01:45:26,901 --> 01:45:27,697
- Fine.

1771
01:45:27,769 --> 01:45:29,737
And quit using that word "kwan."

1772
01:45:29,804 --> 01:45:30,862
That's my word!

1773
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:32,599
- I'll see you in L.A. - No heart.

1774
01:45:32,674 --> 01:45:35,405
No heart?

1775
01:45:35,443 --> 01:45:37,434
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

1776
01:46:15,884 --> 01:46:17,613
How many concussions has he had?

1777
01:46:17,685 --> 01:46:20,813
I don't get no respect. This is bullshit.

1778
01:46:20,889 --> 01:46:23,050
You know what I'm saying? I'm making miracles happen.

1779
01:46:41,075 --> 01:46:45,739
You guys, I go to see this so-called black film the other day.

1780
01:46:45,914 --> 01:46:48,178
Honey, no more salt for you.

1781
01:46:48,249 --> 01:46:53,021
The biggest game of the season's coming up. I don't want you dehydrated for Monday Night Football.

1782
01:46:54,556 --> 01:46:58,652
Anyway, 20 minutes of coming attractions.

1783
01:46:58,726 --> 01:47:00,853
All black films, all violent.

1784
01:47:00,929 --> 01:47:03,227
I'm talking about brothers shooting brothers.

1785
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,789
I hate you going to the movies alone without me.

1786
01:47:05,867 --> 01:47:07,767
Oh, baby.

1787
01:47:08,403 --> 01:47:10,667
- My Pisces queen. - Oh, baby.

1788
01:47:13,308 --> 01:47:15,799
I hate seeing movies without you.

1789
01:47:18,613 --> 01:47:21,241
I won't do it anymore, okay?

1790
01:47:21,316 --> 01:47:22,874
I promise.Ok

1791
01:47:26,254 --> 01:47:27,243
Another one.

1792
01:47:28,556 --> 01:47:29,454
Chi-Chi-Bear.

1793
01:47:30,692 --> 01:47:32,717
- Baby. - Baby.

1794
01:47:32,794 --> 01:47:35,524
- Oh, baby. Baby.

1795
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:36,389
- Oh, baby. Oh! Baby!

1796
01:47:36,464 --> 01:47:37,328
- Now? - Oh, baby, baby now! Baby now!

1797
01:47:37,398 --> 01:47:42,362
- Baby? - Ray, it's time to go!

1798
01:47:42,804 --> 01:47:43,930
- Baby. Come on.

1799
01:47:44,038 --> 01:47:44,834
- You got them?

1800
01:47:44,906 --> 01:47:46,931
Hey, you take Visa? Take it!

1801
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:51,237
What were you thinking tonight...

1802
01:47:51,312 --> 01:47:56,848
watching them go through... the entire human emotional experience?

1803
01:47:56,851 --> 01:47:59,615
I was thinking, "I hope he doesn't get injured."

1804
01:48:01,823 --> 01:48:03,814
I felt responsible.

1805
01:48:05,426 --> 01:48:10,193
Sometimes I can't tell at all what's going on in that head of yours.

1806
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:18,495
And I really don't know your noises yet.

1807
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:22,766
Well, when you wonder, ask me.

1808
01:48:22,844 --> 01:48:24,812
Okay, I will.

1809
01:48:27,015 --> 01:48:29,142
I thought I just did.

1810
01:48:34,422 --> 01:48:36,947
- Why do you love me? - Why do you love me?

1811
01:48:38,593 --> 01:48:40,527
Can I come in and watch TV?

1812
01:48:40,595 --> 01:48:42,563
- In a minute. - Just for a few minutes.

1813
01:49:03,051 --> 01:49:05,042
Hang in there. He's not going anywhere.

1814
01:49:05,453 --> 01:49:07,512
I know.

1815
01:49:07,588 --> 01:49:10,352
Could we talk about something else?

1816
01:49:10,425 --> 01:49:14,054
I don't think so. I'm incapable of small talk.

1817
01:49:14,128 --> 01:49:16,426
But that's why you love me, right?

1818
01:49:29,877 --> 01:49:32,437
I want you to know I'm about personal attention.

1819
01:49:32,513 --> 01:49:36,643
This is my life. I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

1820
01:49:36,718 --> 01:49:38,447
I'm in my office. Call me anytime.

1821
01:49:38,519 --> 01:49:40,851
I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow for Monday Night Football.

1822
01:49:40,922 --> 01:49:44,483
I can be in Indiana by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

1823
01:49:44,559 --> 01:49:46,322
Just give me 20 minutes.

1824
01:49:47,028 --> 01:49:49,087
I'm not asking for an answer now.

1825
01:49:49,163 --> 01:49:51,393
Why don't you... I'll call you tomorrow.

1826
01:49:51,466 --> 01:49:54,663
Just enjoy the rest of your day. Tell Douglas I said hello, would you?

1827
01:49:55,069 --> 01:49:56,661
All right. Thank you.

1828
01:49:56,738 --> 01:49:58,467
Same to you, Marilee. Bye-bye.

1829
01:50:01,609 --> 01:50:03,270
Indiana, Tuesday.

1830
01:50:03,745 --> 01:50:05,337
I'll be there.

1831
01:50:09,484 --> 01:50:10,974
It's my fault.

1832
01:50:13,454 --> 01:50:14,216
What?

1833
01:50:14,722 --> 01:50:16,656
It's not fair to you,

1834
01:50:16,724 --> 01:50:18,021
this whole thing.

1835
01:50:21,529 --> 01:50:22,894
Here.

1836
01:50:24,098 --> 01:50:27,033
Tell me. Let me help.

1837
01:50:27,535 --> 01:50:29,366
I took advantage of you.

1838
01:50:29,437 --> 01:50:33,305
The worst of it is that I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.

1839
01:50:34,408 --> 01:50:38,037
I was just on some wild ride...

1840
01:50:38,112 --> 01:50:44,177
where I thought that I was in love enough... for both of us.

1841
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:48,487
I pretended that proposal by the car was real...

1842
01:50:48,556 --> 01:50:50,820
and it might've just been a hypothetical.

1843
01:50:54,462 --> 01:50:56,362
I did this...

1844
01:50:56,798 --> 01:50:59,961
and at least I can do something about it now.

1845
01:51:00,935 --> 01:51:03,836
I'm not a guy who runs.

1846
01:51:03,905 --> 01:51:05,668
I stick.

1847
01:51:07,775 --> 01:51:10,243
Well, I don't need you to stick.

1848
01:51:11,579 --> 01:51:12,978
- What do you want? - I don't know.

1849
01:51:13,047 --> 01:51:14,878
- My soul or something?

1850
01:51:14,949 --> 01:51:17,281
- Why not? I deserve that.

1851
01:51:18,953 --> 01:51:20,921
What if I'm not built that way?

1852
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:24,023
- I think we made a mistake.

1853
01:51:24,091 --> 01:51:27,026
- No, listen. What if it's true?

1854
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:31,993
Great at friendship, bad at intimacy.

1855
01:51:32,066 --> 01:51:36,594
I mean, come on, it's the theme of my bachelor film, for God's sake.

1856
01:51:36,671 --> 01:51:39,105
I know. I watched it.

1857
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,701
I sort of know it by heart.

1858
01:51:44,879 --> 01:51:46,938
I don't like to give up.

1859
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:49,508
Please, Jerry.

1860
01:51:49,984 --> 01:51:54,717
My need to make the best of things and your need to be responsible.

1861
01:51:55,289 --> 01:51:57,621
If one of us doesn't say something about it now...

1862
01:51:57,692 --> 01:52:01,423
we could lose ten years being polite.

1863
01:52:04,165 --> 01:52:08,602
Let's just call this next road trip what it really is...

1864
01:52:10,037 --> 01:52:11,629
a nice, long break.

1865
01:52:20,748 --> 01:52:21,976
What about Ray?

1866
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,447
Well, you'll be friends.

1867
01:52:30,024 --> 01:52:31,514
- Friends?

1868
01:52:31,592 --> 01:52:33,116
- Friends.

1869
01:52:36,297 --> 01:52:38,288
Of course you'll be friends.

1870
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:40,926
I'll take him to the zoo.

1871
01:52:44,939 --> 01:52:47,703
So this break is a breakup.

1872
01:52:48,276 --> 01:52:49,766
Come on, Jerry.

1873
01:52:49,844 --> 01:52:52,404
You know this isn't easy for me.

1874
01:52:53,581 --> 01:52:56,414
On the surface everything looks fine.

1875
01:52:57,418 --> 01:52:59,648
I've got this great guy...

1876
01:53:01,289 --> 01:53:04,156
and he loves my kid...

1877
01:53:06,594 --> 01:53:09,324
and he sure does like me a lot.

1878
01:53:15,903 --> 01:53:18,667
And I can't live like that.

1879
01:53:21,809 --> 01:53:24,573
It's not how I'm built.

1880
01:53:57,011 --> 01:53:59,741
If this is empty...

1881
01:53:59,814 --> 01:54:01,748
this doesn't matter.

1882
01:54:24,071 --> 01:54:25,868
It was just a mission statement.

1883
01:54:42,523 --> 01:54:44,514
Put your arms out. Let's see.

1884
01:54:44,592 --> 01:54:46,617
All right. Let's see what you've got here.

1885
01:54:58,906 --> 01:55:01,170
Hey, Rod, buddy, dude.

1886
01:55:01,242 --> 01:55:03,005
I was wondering where you were. How's it going?

1887
01:55:03,077 --> 01:55:05,910
Get out of here. Go.

1888
01:55:07,681 --> 01:55:09,148
- Where's your agent?

1889
01:55:09,216 --> 01:55:10,979
- I don't know.

1890
01:55:11,685 --> 01:55:15,382
I know this is uncool to do this now, but you belong with the big boys.

1891
01:55:15,456 --> 01:55:17,287
You belong with the big money. You're fucking Rod Tidwell.

1892
01:55:17,358 --> 01:55:20,561
Get away from my guy.

1893
01:55:20,561 --> 01:55:21,892
- Hey, Jerry, I was just hailing you.

1894
01:55:21,962 --> 01:55:23,395
- Just go. Flee.

1895
01:55:25,633 --> 01:55:27,567
This is a nice moment for you.

1896
01:55:28,035 --> 01:55:29,935
I'm gonna let you have it.

1897
01:55:32,039 --> 01:55:34,473
Give me a call, Rod. Say hi to Marcee for me.

1898
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:45,050
- Thanks for coming.

1899
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:45,778
- I missed you.

1900
01:55:48,189 --> 01:55:50,157
What can I say?

1901
01:55:50,224 --> 01:55:52,283
You're all I've got.

1902
01:55:54,428 --> 01:55:55,725
Hello again, everyone. Frank Gifford with Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf.

1903
01:55:55,796 --> 01:56:00,096
Welcome to Tempe, Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium...

1904
01:56:00,167 --> 01:56:04,696
where the story tonight is the Arizona Cardinals. They are still alive for a play-off spot.

1905
01:56:04,705 --> 01:56:07,037
The reason the Cardinals are alive is the outstanding play...

1906
01:56:07,108 --> 01:56:10,043
the surprising play of Rod Tidwell.

1907
01:56:10,111 --> 01:56:11,874
- We'll talk about that too. - That's my daddy!

1908
01:56:11,946 --> 01:56:14,073
Meanwhile, the Dallas Cowboys continue to roll.

1909
01:56:14,148 --> 01:56:18,013
They know they're in the play-offs... and going in looking for a second consecutive Super Bowl.

1910
01:56:18,052 --> 01:56:20,111
Who could've believed this? Here's the deal.

1911
01:56:20,187 --> 01:56:22,655
If Arizona wins tonight and next week...

1912
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:27,890
amazingly the Cardinals will make the play-offs... for the first time in 21 years.

1913
01:56:29,296 --> 01:56:32,697
Better not mess up for Monday Night Football.

1914
01:56:33,167 --> 01:56:34,600
What'd I say?

1915
01:56:34,668 --> 01:56:37,501
Everybody knows he gets nervous for nationally televised games.

1916
01:56:37,571 --> 01:56:42,537
The Cowboys continue their Super Bowl mission on Monday Night Football... a Christmas edition.

1917
01:56:49,850 --> 01:56:50,748
- Hey, Shannon.

1918
01:56:50,818 --> 01:56:52,342
- Hi, Jerry. Good game.

1919
01:56:52,419 --> 01:56:54,148
Yeah. Hey, great column this morning.

1920
01:56:54,221 --> 01:56:54,880
Thanks.

1921
01:57:01,061 --> 01:57:02,460
Fuck you, punk!

1922
01:57:09,603 --> 01:57:12,128
Boy, guys, it's a real bruiser out there tonight.

1923
01:57:12,206 --> 01:57:16,609
Frank, the Cardinals just refuse to go quietly into the desert night...

1924
01:57:16,677 --> 01:57:18,975
as their seemingly interminable season winds down.

1925
01:57:19,046 --> 01:57:21,412
Come on, guys. I'm trying to be a little poetic here.

1926
01:57:21,482 --> 01:57:23,313
Wax on, Al. Wax on.

1927
01:57:25,853 --> 01:57:28,048
Oh, a tough hit on Rod Tidwell.

1928
01:57:28,122 --> 01:57:29,589
Nothing poetic about that.

1929
01:57:29,657 --> 01:57:32,091
I would've taken it for the touchdown all the way, baby.

1930
01:57:32,493 --> 01:57:34,324
That's his sixth catch of the night. Split to the right.

1931
01:57:34,395 --> 01:57:37,464
Swenson looks that way, hits him...

1932
01:57:37,464 --> 01:57:39,364
and it's enough for a first down at the 19-yard line.

1933
01:57:39,433 --> 01:57:43,369
Another savage hit across the middle on Rod Tidwell.

1934
01:57:44,038 --> 01:57:45,130
He took some shot, didn't he?

1935
01:57:45,806 --> 01:57:48,604
They are working Tidwell, aren't they?

1936
01:57:48,676 --> 01:57:50,507
- Hey, what does Daddy always say? - Nice job by Swenson.

1937
01:57:50,578 --> 01:57:52,739
- "It looks worse than it really is."

1938
01:57:52,813 --> 01:57:54,246
- That's right.

1939
01:57:54,315 --> 01:57:56,943
He ain't gonna have nothing left for next season. He'll kill himself!

1940
01:57:57,017 --> 01:57:58,314
- Can you be quiet?

1941
01:57:58,385 --> 01:57:59,113
- What'd I say?

1942
01:57:59,186 --> 01:58:00,676
Less than two minutes to play.

1943
01:58:00,754 --> 01:58:02,745
Dallas leading by three.

1944
01:58:02,823 --> 01:58:07,283
Second down and one now at the Dallas 11-yard line.

1945
01:58:07,595 --> 01:58:09,932
- Hut! - Swenson back to pass.

1946
01:58:09,932 --> 01:58:13,629
A blitz! And down he goes! He's sacked for a six-yard loss.

1947
01:58:14,068 --> 01:58:16,400
Good move coming with the blitz, getting after Swenson.

1948
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:17,835
Swenson's limping back. He had too many men in that pattern.

1949
01:58:17,905 --> 01:58:22,642
They just did not have enough to pick up the blitz.

1950
01:58:22,676 --> 01:58:24,166
- Listen up. Listen up. - Shut up!

1951
01:58:24,478 --> 01:58:27,675
Ninety razor, X out, on one. Ready?

1952
01:58:27,748 --> 01:58:28,806
Break!

1953
01:58:28,882 --> 01:58:31,043
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1954
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:34,212
He had a chance to get rid of it, but he had to tuck it away.

1955
01:58:34,288 --> 01:58:37,780
From second and one, they've now gone to third and seven.

1956
01:58:37,858 --> 01:58:39,723
In the waning moments of this game,

1957
01:58:39,793 --> 01:58:41,930
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.

1958
01:58:43,364 --> 01:58:45,355
- Tidwell in motion... - Come on, Cards!

1959
01:58:45,432 --> 01:58:48,367
Moving back to his left now.

1960
01:58:48,435 --> 01:58:51,666
Play fake. Swenson protected well, lofts one to the end zone!

1961
01:58:51,739 --> 01:58:54,503
- Yes! - Touchdown Cardinals!

1962
01:58:54,575 --> 01:58:56,975
What a great effort! Did you see him go up on that ball?

1963
01:58:57,044 --> 01:59:00,013
He held on to the football. He's still down on the ground.

1964
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:03,607
But Rod Tidwell, upside-down, hits the ground hard...

1965
01:59:03,684 --> 01:59:05,743
and manages to maintain control of the football.

1966
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:08,549
Oh, yeah, he's hurt too. Oh, yeah.

1967
01:59:08,722 --> 01:59:10,519
He's not getting up.

1968
01:59:10,591 --> 01:59:13,822
Boy, look at the faces of these Cardinal players now...

1969
01:59:13,894 --> 01:59:15,764
- as elation turns into concern... - Oh, my God. Get up, baby.

1970
01:59:15,764 --> 01:59:19,131
- For their fallen teammate. - Cardinal trainer goes to the field...

1971
01:59:19,166 --> 01:59:21,498
- as Tidwell makes his ninth catch... - Oh, my God.

1972
01:59:21,568 --> 01:59:23,729
And gives Arizona the lead.

1973
01:59:31,912 --> 01:59:33,345
Can you hear me? Blink, baby.

1974
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:36,309
Come on, blink!

1975
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:37,446
Rod

1976
01:59:42,458 --> 01:59:47,394
- We'll come back to... - Why are they going to a commercial? Tell me what's wrong with my husband.

1977
01:59:47,428 --> 01:59:49,828
See, I told you he was too small for the NFL.

1978
01:59:49,897 --> 01:59:50,761
- Shut up! - I just got a commitment to the truth.

1979
01:59:50,831 --> 01:59:54,001
I'm not putting him down. I'm keeping it real.

1980
01:59:54,001 --> 01:59:55,764
Tee Pee, shut up!

1981
01:59:55,836 --> 01:59:58,430
Can't you be loyal to your brother that loves you?

1982
01:59:58,505 --> 02:00:01,303
Get the hell outta my house. Get out of my house!

1983
02:00:01,942 --> 02:00:03,068
- Get out of my house, Tee Pee! - Hello?

1984
02:00:03,143 --> 02:00:04,075
Hold on.

1985
02:00:04,144 --> 02:00:05,406
It's Jerry Maguire.

1986
02:00:06,246 --> 02:00:07,736
Punk!

1987
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:10,939
Jerry

1988
02:00:11,018 --> 02:00:13,350
Oh, my God, Jerry, I am freaking out.

1989
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,388
Marcee, he's unconscious.

1990
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,258
No, I know. Just stay calm. Keep the phone lines open.

1991
02:00:18,325 --> 02:00:20,828
I will call you back.

1992
02:00:20,828 --> 02:00:23,564
There's good doctors on the field. Just stay calm.

1993
02:00:23,564 --> 02:00:25,555
No, you have to tell me something.

1994
02:00:25,632 --> 02:00:27,998
I cannot stay calm. I am freaking here.

1995
02:00:28,068 --> 02:00:31,799
Please. You gotta stay calm. Your family needs you to stay calm.

1996
02:00:31,872 --> 02:00:33,999
I know. I know.

1997
02:00:34,074 --> 02:00:37,407
But my whole life is this family...

1998
02:00:37,478 --> 02:00:39,948
and it does not work without him!

1999
02:00:39,948 --> 02:00:42,912
And right now, as we look at it from another angle...

2000
02:00:42,983 --> 02:00:44,746
all eyes here at Sun Devil Stadium...

2001
02:00:44,818 --> 02:00:49,983
Jerry, I am so sorry. Everything that I said about your job.

2002
02:00:50,057 --> 02:00:53,720
Just do whatever you can to get Rod to me, please.

2003
02:00:53,794 --> 02:00:56,058
Just do whatever you can.

2004
02:00:56,497 --> 02:00:58,124
Please, Jerry.

2005
02:00:58,799 --> 02:01:03,670
I'll tell you, at a time like this... you just hope that his family is not watching this.

2006
02:01:04,505 --> 02:01:07,702
Check his neck. It could be his neck. It could be his back.

2007
02:01:11,912 --> 02:01:13,345
Blink, baby!

2008
02:01:13,414 --> 02:01:14,847
Come on, wake up!

2009
02:01:17,017 --> 02:01:19,110
We love you, Rod!

2010
02:01:27,828 --> 02:01:31,497
Rod, can you hear me?

2011
02:01:31,632 --> 02:01:33,293
Can you hear me?

2012
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,534
Do you know where you are, Rod?

2013
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:39,405
You can see the trainer still trying to revive Rod Tidwell.

2014
02:01:39,473 --> 02:01:40,872
You'd love to see some movement.

2015
02:01:42,609 --> 02:01:44,668
Let's get him off the field. Get the gurney.

2016
02:01:45,446 --> 02:01:48,813
Get the gurney. Let's get him off the field now.

2017
02:01:48,882 --> 02:01:50,372
No, wait, wait, wait.

2018
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:53,652
Just let me enjoy this for a minute.

2019
02:01:53,787 --> 02:01:57,086
You're looking for any type of movement out of Rod Tidwell.

2020
02:01:57,157 --> 02:01:58,317
- Is that his head coming up I see?

2021
02:01:58,392 --> 02:02:00,417
- He's gonna try to get up.

2022
02:02:02,663 --> 02:02:04,324
And he is getting up!

2023
02:02:12,773 --> 02:02:16,004
Oh, my God! Look at him. Mommy, he's okay!

2024
02:02:18,046 --> 02:02:19,536
Oh, my God!

2025
02:02:20,147 --> 02:02:22,877
- Help me. - Everybody's standing in the stadium.

2026
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:24,577
He's up on his feet, and the crowd loves it.

2027
02:02:54,047 --> 02:02:59,986
Here's a guy who most of the season has been very truculent with the media... has been standoffish.

2028
02:03:14,768 --> 02:03:17,134
Rod, we're happy for you, buddy.

2029
02:03:17,204 --> 02:03:20,264
He's gonna get a flag on this, but who cares?

2030
02:03:20,674 --> 02:03:22,574


2031
02:03:30,984 --> 02:03:33,179
You know!

2032
02:03:34,421 --> 02:03:35,820
You know!

2033
02:03:35,889 --> 02:03:36,617
- Congratulations, Jerry.

2034
02:03:36,690 --> 02:03:38,749
- Thank you. Hell of a game.

2035
02:03:39,927 --> 02:03:41,588
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

2036
02:03:43,432 --> 02:03:44,865
Bye.

2037
02:03:44,965 --> 02:03:45,829
Jerry

2038
02:03:46,166 --> 02:03:47,428
Jerry Maguire

2039
02:03:50,304 --> 02:03:52,465


2040
02:03:52,539 --> 02:03:54,473
I know. I know.

2041
02:04:00,747 --> 02:04:02,009
It's Tidwell!

2042
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:14,649
Jerry

2043
02:04:15,095 --> 02:04:16,824
Where's Jerry?

2044
02:04:22,204 --> 02:04:24,138
Over here, Rod!

2045
02:04:37,117 --> 02:04:38,584
We did it.

2046
02:04:39,086 --> 02:04:40,713
You did it.

2047
02:04:42,756 --> 02:04:45,247
Why don't we have that kind of relationship?

2048
02:04:54,635 --> 02:04:56,569
Is that your porty or mine?

2049
02:05:00,307 --> 02:05:01,865
Dorothy

2050
02:05:02,876 --> 02:05:04,070
arcee

2051
02:05:04,144 --> 02:05:06,271
No, no, no. He's right here. He's right here.

2052
02:05:06,346 --> 02:05:07,608
It's Marcee.

2053
02:05:07,914 --> 02:05:09,541
She couldn't get through on your phone.

2054
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:13,980
We did it!

2055
02:05:14,855 --> 02:05:17,187
I love you! I love you so much!

2056
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:23,124
I love you!

2057
02:05:28,468 --> 02:05:30,299
I love you, Tyson.

2058
02:05:30,370 --> 02:05:32,065
I love you, baby.

2059
02:05:32,139 --> 02:05:34,266
How's the baby? How's Kaydee?

2060
02:05:35,442 --> 02:05:37,842
Oh, I love you so much.

2061
02:05:39,846 --> 02:05:42,644
No, I'm okay. You know there ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

2062
02:05:52,025 --> 02:05:53,151
I think the problem is...

2063
02:05:53,226 --> 02:05:56,593
Alice, you were saying earlier, something about the biorhythms or...

2064
02:05:57,798 --> 02:06:01,165
I was saying that the neural pathways are set...

2065
02:06:01,234 --> 02:06:06,203
and that's why it's hard for people to change. That's why behavior doesn't change very often.

2066
02:06:07,974 --> 02:06:09,635
- Rochelle, what's wrong? - I'm sorry.

2067
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:14,541
These stupid holidays are making me feel more divorced.

2068
02:06:14,581 --> 02:06:16,515
- You know? - Absolutely.

2069
02:06:16,583 --> 02:06:19,677
I mean, with the songs and the constant chocolate-eating...

2070
02:06:35,569 --> 02:06:37,730
You know what? I have a confession to make.

2071
02:06:39,005 --> 02:06:42,668
I've listened to you all tell a thousand sob stories...

2072
02:06:42,743 --> 02:06:46,645
and, well, I've been very judgmental.

2073
02:06:46,713 --> 02:06:48,442
Maybe you're all correct.

2074
02:06:48,515 --> 02:06:51,279
Men are the enemy.

2075
02:06:51,351 --> 02:06:53,216
- Thank you. - No, they're not the enemy.

2076
02:06:53,286 --> 02:06:55,083
But

2077
02:06:55,155 --> 02:06:58,022
I still love the enemy.

2078
02:07:12,272 --> 02:07:14,035
Hello. Hello.

2079
02:07:16,042 --> 02:07:17,839
I'm looking for my wife.

2080
02:07:30,857 --> 02:07:32,188
Wait.

2081
02:07:33,593 --> 02:07:35,720
Okey

2082
02:07:42,402 --> 02:07:46,634
If this is where it has to happen, then this is where it has to happen.

2083
02:07:48,074 --> 02:07:51,043
I'm not letting you get rid of me.

2084
02:07:51,111 --> 02:07:52,169
How about that?

2085
02:07:58,351 --> 02:08:01,323
This used to be my specialty. I was good in the living room.

2086
02:08:01,323 --> 02:08:04,724
They'd send me in there, I'd do it alone.

2087
02:08:05,158 --> 02:08:06,989
And now, I just...

2088
02:08:13,433 --> 02:08:14,957
And now

2089
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,137
But tonight...

2090
02:08:23,043 --> 02:08:28,915
our little project, our company... had a very big night...

2091
02:08:28,915 --> 02:08:32,976
a very, very big night.

2092
02:08:35,956 --> 02:08:38,049
But it wasn't complete.

2093
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:46,766
It wasn't nearly close... to being in the same vicinity as complete...

2094
02:08:46,766 --> 02:08:48,791
because I couldn't share it with you.

2095
02:08:50,837 --> 02:08:52,964
I couldn't hear your voice...

2096
02:08:55,041 --> 02:08:57,509
or laugh about it with you.

2097
02:09:00,046 --> 02:09:01,570
I miss my...

2098
02:09:01,648 --> 02:09:03,513
I miss my wife.

2099
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:21,692
We live in a cynical world...

2100
02:09:21,768 --> 02:09:24,601
a cynical world...

2101
02:09:25,338 --> 02:09:29,536
and we work in a business of tough competitors.

2102
02:09:39,853 --> 02:09:41,844
I love you.

2103
02:09:41,922 --> 02:09:43,389
You...

2104
02:09:44,991 --> 02:09:46,982
complete me.

2105
02:09:48,228 --> 02:09:49,525
- I'm not just...

2106
02:09:49,596 --> 02:09:50,494
- Shut up.

2107
02:09:51,398 --> 02:09:53,298
Just shut up.

2108
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:56,260
You had me at "hello."

2109
02:09:57,170 --> 02:09:59,695
You had me at "hello."

2110
02:10:11,718 --> 02:10:15,210
This is the best talking group I've ever been in.

2111
02:10:15,288 --> 02:10:17,882
Your father leaves home on Christmas Eve...

2112
02:10:17,958 --> 02:10:19,084
leaves your family all alone;

2113
02:10:19,826 --> 02:10:24,789
had a mother who had to sweep out the steps at a prison just to earn enough money for tuition for you.

2114
02:10:25,131 --> 02:10:28,589
Your brother loses a leg in a tragic bass fishing accident.

2115
02:10:28,668 --> 02:10:32,035
There's been a horrific list of things that have happened to you in your life.

2116
02:10:32,706 --> 02:10:34,901
I'm not gonna cry, Roy.

2117
02:10:34,975 --> 02:10:36,738
We have some good news for you.

2118
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:38,175
This has just been handed to me.

2119
02:10:38,345 --> 02:10:41,940
A memo. It's signed. It's a contract guarantee.

2120
02:10:42,015 --> 02:10:44,279
"Arizona Cardinals, four years...

2121
02:10:44,351 --> 02:10:47,252
$11.2 million."

2122
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:50,551
You're gonna get to play in Arizona, where it all started.

2123
02:10:50,623 --> 02:10:51,749
Finish up your career in Arizona. What do you think of that?

2124
02:10:57,532 --> 02:10:59,295
Oh, my God.

2125
02:11:11,044 --> 02:11:13,512
I love everybody!

2126
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:16,071
I love my wife!

2127
02:11:16,149 --> 02:11:17,138
Marcee

2128
02:11:17,617 --> 02:11:21,921
- Baby, I love you. - I love my kids... Tyson, my baby, my new baby Kaydee.

2129
02:11:21,955 --> 02:11:25,083
My older brother who's got one leg, but he's still doing it...

2130
02:11:25,158 --> 02:11:27,422
and my younger brother Tee Pee.

2131
02:11:27,494 --> 02:11:31,157
You're militant, but I ain't mad at you. I got nothing but love for you!

2132
02:11:31,231 --> 02:11:33,468
I love my teammates.

2133
02:11:33,468 --> 02:11:36,169
- I'm leaving somebody out here, Roy. - We only have a half-hour show.

2134
02:11:36,169 --> 02:11:39,195
I wanna send some beautiful love out to my offensive line.

2135
02:11:39,272 --> 02:11:40,796
These are fierce, beautiful...

2136
02:11:40,874 --> 02:11:45,011
- Nice to see you. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Good for you. - Thank you. How are you, Lee?

2137
02:11:45,011 --> 02:11:47,138
Hey, Jerry, how you doing?

2138
02:11:47,213 --> 02:11:49,408
Remember Troy from the Super Bowl party?

2139
02:11:49,482 --> 02:11:51,074
- I sure do. We met in '93. - Hi, Jerry. Good to see you.

2140
02:11:51,151 --> 02:11:53,711
- I enjoyed your memo. - Thank you. Thank you.

2141
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:55,954
You're a little slow, but you come around!

2142
02:11:56,022 --> 02:11:57,717
- Okay, we're almost out of time...

2143
02:11:57,791 --> 02:12:01,626
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm forgetting somebody.

2144
02:12:02,662 --> 02:12:04,095
Jerry Maguire,

2145
02:12:05,432 --> 02:12:07,127
my agent.

2146
02:12:10,203 --> 02:12:12,763
You are my ambassador of kwan, man.

2147
02:12:15,241 --> 02:12:18,039
Rod, thank you so much. Congratulations.

2148
02:12:18,111 --> 02:12:19,442
Congratulations. We'll be right back.

2149
02:12:22,949 --> 02:12:24,917
- How did you like the zoo, buddy? - Swing.

2150
02:12:25,351 --> 02:12:27,581
It was great!

2151
02:12:27,987 --> 02:12:30,649
One, two, three, swing!

2152
02:12:33,193 --> 02:12:35,354
Hey, kid, throw the ball! Come on!

2153
02:12:35,428 --> 02:12:39,399
Come on, throw the ball!

2154
02:12:45,605 --> 02:12:48,438
- Good throw, man! - Nice throw!

2155
02:12:50,143 --> 02:12:51,610
Did you see?

2156
02:12:52,645 --> 02:12:55,307
Oh, no. Let's go.

2157
02:12:55,515 --> 02:12:56,743
- What? What?

2158
02:12:57,417 --> 02:12:58,247
- Nothing.

2159
02:12:58,318 --> 02:13:00,479
I'm not saying we're gonna throw him in the major leagues tomorrow.

2160
02:13:00,553 --> 02:13:03,044
But if he's got natural talent and a pure joy for the game...

2161
02:13:03,123 --> 02:13:08,060
you're lucky you know me, because I know the right people... that will help develop his talent.

2162
02:13:21,442 --> 02:13:24,611
Hey, I don't have all the answers.

2163
02:13:24,611 --> 02:13:26,738
In life, to be honest,

2164
02:13:26,813 --> 02:13:30,305
I've failed as much as I've succeeded.

2165
02:13:30,383 --> 02:13:32,283
But I love my wife,

2166
02:13:32,352 --> 02:13:34,115
I love my life...

2167
02:13:34,187 --> 02:13:35,518
and I wish you

2168
02:13:35,588 --> 02:13:37,055
my kind of success.

2169
02:13:37,423 --> 02:13:40,756
The End!

2170
02:13:41,494 --> 02:13:48,161
