开战车来也挡不住你爸爸

对吗？
Right?

96
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:09,118
去你的！
Fuck you.

97
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,253
我变成什么样的人？
Who had I become?

98
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:15,261
衣冠禽兽？
Just another shark in a suit?

99
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:37,807
K球员巨额薪资都是你造成的
...with the skyrocketing salaries... and you are one of the guys responsible.

100
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:41,282
他是杰出的运动员
- Fuck you. - This guy is a sensational athlete.

101
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,682
两天后我参加了迈阿密的会议
Two days later, at our corporate conference in Miami,

102
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,088
我有了突破

崩溃？

104
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,559
突破
Break through.

105
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:54,228
去你的！
- I just wanted an autograph. - Fuck you.

106
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:55,566
记得你叫什么名字？
Do you know your name?

107
00:05:57,371 --> 00:06:00,829
我无法逃避一个想法
I couldn't escape one simple thought.

108
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,638
我痛恨自己
I hated myself.

109
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,106
不K更确切的说
No, here's what it was.

110
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:12,051
我痛恨所扮演的角色
I hated my place in the world.

111
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:20,986
我心中的话没人肯听
I had so much to say and no one to listen.

112
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:24,859
事情发生了
And then it happened.

113
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,933
一件最怪异K
It was the oddest, most

114
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,002
出乎预料的事情
unexpected thing.

115
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:36,001
我写了一篇工作感言
I began writing what they call a mission statement.

116
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,472
不是备忘录，是感言
Not a memo, a mission statement.

117
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:41,606
对公司的方针提供建议
You know, a suggestion for the future of our company.

118
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,342
此情此景并非俯拾即是
A night like this doesn't come along very often.

119
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,751
我抓住这片刻
I seized it.

120
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:53,224
由一页增为二十五页
What started out as one page became 25.

121
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:57,089
突然间K我找回父亲所期望的我
Suddenly I was my father's son again.

122
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:59,892
我想起这份工作的乐趣
I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job...

123
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,696
想起当初怎么会选这一行
how I ended up here out of law school...

124
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:06,103
看台上观众欢声雷动的狂热
the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field...

125
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:10,368
我们该保护球员K 不论健康或受伤时
the way we are meant to protect them in health and in injury.

126
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,244
客户过多造成无法真心相待
With so many clients, we had forgotten what was important.

127
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:18,308
我不断的写了又写
I wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote...

128
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,180
我的文笔不算好
and I'm not even a writer.

129
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:25,793
但我记得指导员的每句话 迪克法科斯曾说K
I was remembering even the words of the original sports agent my mentor the late, great Dicky Fox who said:

130
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,923
这行最重要的是人际关系
The key to this business is personal relationships.

131
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,995
突然间豁然开朗
Suddenly it was all pretty clear.

132
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:35,194
答案就是减少客户人数
The answer was fewer clients, less money.

133
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,204
少赚点钱、多关心客户
More attention. Caring for them.

134
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:40,600
关心自己、关心比赛
Caring for ourselves. And the games too.

135
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:44,132
好好面对生活，体验它！
Just starting our lives, really.

136
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:46,215
我不否认自己写的是K
I'll be the first to admit it.

137
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,651
肺腑之言
What I was writing was somewhat touchy-feely.

138
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,277
我不在乎，我不愿再鬼扯
I didn't care. I had lost the ability to bullshit.

139
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:56,016
忠于自己才是我想要的
It was the me I'd always wanted to be.

140
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:03,831
三更半夜我去印了110份
I took it to a Copymat in the middle of the night... and printed up 110 copies.

141
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:06,629
连封皮都像真理的书
Even the cover looked like The Catcher in the Rye.

142
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:08,901
我给它取名为K
I entitled it...

143
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:11,904
心中想却说不出的话K
The Things We Think and Do Not Say:

144
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,498
这一行的远景
The Future of Our Business.

145
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,367
这种精神会成功
That's how you become great, man.

146
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:21,247
奋力一搏
Hang your balls out there.

147
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,575
谢谢
Thanks.

148
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:26,915
每人都发一份
Everybody got a copy.

149
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:30,047
有些靠双脚而行的野兽
There are dangerous animals in the world and some of them walk on two feet.

150
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:32,315
他们不要和平、不懂爱
They don't want peace and they're not capable of love.

151
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,922
社会是指你们这些人K
Society... and that means you and you and you...

152
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,793
必需受野兽的保护
need protection from these warped minds.

153
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,577
Boom.

154
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,955
我是杰瑞，那些文件K
This is Jerry Maguire. - Did those manuscripts get... - They've all gone out.

155
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,352
发出去了？
They did? Oh, no, no, no.

156
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:06,684
不K没关系 谢谢
That's fine. Thank you.

157
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:25,109
前台，有什么需要帮助吗?
Front desk. How may I help you?

158
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,590
终于有人说话了
- All right! - Finally, somebody said it.

159
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,592
马圭尔，干得好！
Good work, Maguire!

160
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,835
难以置信
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

161
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,276
当年我35岁
I was 35.

162
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:05,341
开始了崭新的生命
I'd started my life.

163
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,878
他多久会被开除？
How long do you give him?

164
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,286
一星期吧
About a week.

165
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,333
你跟球员一起的？
- So you're with the sports people?

166
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,062
杰瑞马奎尔，SMI公司
- I'm Jerry Maguire.- SMI.

167
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,332
芭比菲隆，BPI公司

168
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,396
从事可乐广告赛后制作
I'm producing the Coke commercials for the play-offs.

169
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,135
祝你顺利
Good luck with that.

170
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:35,911
你好，我儿子对毛毯过敏
That'll be four dollars. Hi. My son is really allergic to the material in the blankets.

171
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,416
只有这种毛毯
That's all we have, okay?

172
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:45,090
抱歉，我态度不佳
I'm sorry if I was rude just then.

173
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,683
没关系
That's okay.

174
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,318
误会冰释
We're in it together now.

175
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,391
你真健谈
Why is it so easy to talk with you?

176
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,056
谈谈你的未婚妻
- Tell me about your fiancee.

177
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:52,996
香槟
- More champagne?

178
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,727
没什么好说的
I don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.

179
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,133
你怎么求婚的？
- Tell me how you proposed.

180
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,603
你还好吗？想喝果汁吗？
- Are you all right? You want some juice?

181
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:01,799
谢谢
Thank you.

182
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:05,367
我们徒步经过池塘边
But we're hiking up through the pools.

183
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:07,575
戒指就在我口袋里
Got the ring in my pocket,

184
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:10,014
我有些紧张
and I'm a little nervous.

185
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,218
我走在她后面，她说K
I'm lagging, you know, and she says to me...

186
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:14,618
听好K
get this...

187
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,679
慢吞吞！快一点
"Hurry up, klutz."

188
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:18,850
听了真不爽
Well, it bothered me somewhat,

189
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:21,687
于是我不出声，她也不说话
and I got quiet. Then she got quiet.

190
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:25,332
我决定K不求婚了
And I decide... I am not gonna propose.

191
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:28,130
气氛不对，何必太冲动？
The mood is not right. Why be impulsive?

192
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:31,103
我发觉她知道我要求婚
At this point, I know she knows...

193
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,571
她也察觉我洞悉她心意
that I was gonna propose and didn't, and she knows I know.

194
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,631
所以我们回到旅馆
- We check back into the Pro Bowl Hotel.

195
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:36,767
真遗憾
- How sad.

196
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:42,613
不，还没结束 没想到助理以为我求婚了
But wait.Now, little do I know that my assistant has assumed that I've now proposed.

197
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,321
要大厅乐队演奏“新娘来了”
So she's gotten the lounge band to play "Here Comes the Bride"...

198
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:48,422
很好听
- when we walk back in. - I love that song.

199
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:54,019
球员们和电台人员众目睽睽下
All the football guys are in the lobby watching. There's even an ESPN crew.

200
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:56,119
我转向她K
So I turn to her,

201
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,686
优雅的说：
sort of grandly say...

202
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:00,764
“慢吞吞”K
"Well, this is me... klutz...

203
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:04,702
向“攀峰女神”求婚
asking you, goddess of rock climbing, to marry me."

204
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:05,897
然后拿出戒指
I took out the ring...

205
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:10,811
我不喜欢当众求婚K
I don't much like big scenes...but...

206
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,438
但她当场答应了
she said yes right there in the lobby.

207
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:17,005
大块头球员哭得像孩子一样
Some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.

208
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,776
我们将在二月结婚
I'm getting married in February.

209
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:24,120
杰瑞，祝你们白头偕老
You two are gonna be married forever.

210
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:31,861
妈，怎么了？
What's wrong, Mom?

211
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:35,201
因为头等舱K
First class is what's wrong, honey.

212
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:38,969
本来只是食物比较好 现在上演更好的生活
It used to be a better meal. Now it's a better life.

213
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:49,444
雷
Ray!

214
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:52,410
回来！
Come on, buddy!

215
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,785
击掌
High five!

216
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,455
天啊！雷K
Oh, God. Ray!

217
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,957
抱歉，我帮得上忙吗？
Excuse me. Can I help you?

218
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,623
杰瑞马圭尔
Jerry Maguire.

219
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,392
我们在同一家公司 这趟会议同行
I work in your office. I was on the junket.

220
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,229
我认识你，你是桃乐丝
I know who you are. You're Dorothy Boyd in Accounts.

221
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:09,894
会计部，你坐位旁挂着K
You have the side-middle cubicle with the poster of Albert Einstein's face...

222
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,703
爱因斯坦与侠客欧尼尔的合成照
morphed on Shaquille O'Neal's body.

223
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,775
很好
That's pretty good.

224
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:19,110
掉了什么？
What did you lose here?

225
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,773
我儿子、我的理智
My son, my mind.

226
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:23,344
雷K
Your son.

227
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:28,450
我去找K桃乐丝！
While I go look... Dorothy?

228
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:32,851
我去找时你先带着这位小绅士
While I look for him, why don't you grab this curious gentleman here?

229
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,187
谢天谢地！
Thank God.

230
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,528
你吓坏我了
You scared me.

231
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,263
吓坏我了！
You scared me.

232
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,169
不准再这样！不准！
- Don't do that again, ever.

233
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,399
好的，妈妈
- Okay, Mommy.

234
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,704
永远不可以！
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

235
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:50,970
不准！
- Okay? Ever!

236
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:51,840
桃乐丝
- Dorothy?

237
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:56,277
- 保重 - 非常感激
- Take care. - Thank you so much.

238
00:13:57,918 --> 00:14:00,045
我喜欢你的备忘录
I loved your memo,

239
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,917
顺便提一下
by the way.

240
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,379
是吗？
- You did?

241
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:05,714
是的
- Yeah.

242
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,319
谢谢
Thanks.

243
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,432
其实那是感言
Actually, it was just a mission statement.

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,061
现在很少人像你这么乐观
In this age, optimism like that is a revolutionary act.

245
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:18,332
真的吗？
- You think so?

246
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:19,467
是的
- Yeah.

247
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,165
很感激
I appreciate that because

248
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:23,334
因为我不确定该不该写
I didn't know if I should write...

249
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,901
当时凌晨两点
I mean, it was 2:00 in the morning.

250
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:29,380
思潮澎湃K明白吗？
I don't know. Some of the stuff I just... Whoo! You know?

251
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:35,152
那是我们该珍惜的特质
That part about how we should embrace... "what is still virginal in our enthusiasm..."

252
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,280
等一下
Not right now, honey.

253
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,517
不要一心只想赚钱K
"And force open the tightly clenched fist of commerce...

254
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:41,356
回馈一些才能走更远的路
and give a little back for the greater good."

255
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:44,256
天啊！你启发了我
- Uh-huh. - God. I was inspired.

256
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:47,027
虽然我是个会计
- And I'm an accountant, you know? - One, two, three, swing!

257
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,838
尊重自己并将想法说出
To respect yourself enough to say it out loud?

258
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:56,400
敞开胸怀，坦诚、赤裸的
To put yourself out there like that, so openly, so nakedly?

259
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:58,908
我不会形容
- I don't know. - Swing!

260
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,913
你启发了我
It got me.

261
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,978
他弄得你心烦吗？
Is this bothering you?

262
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,515
不会K
No, this is...

263
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:10,854
很有意思
great.

264
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,183
很有意思
- This is great. - One, two, three, swing!

265
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:16,728
要不要搭便车？有车吗？
- Do you need a ride? You're okay?

266
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:17,456
什么？
- What?

267
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:18,555
要载一程吗？
- Do you need a lift?

268
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,826
不用了
- Oh, no.

269
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:24,032
要你送还得了？
Yeah, I'm sure that would just make your day...

270
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:28,275
一路载我们到曼哈顿海边
to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach making that left

271
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:32,837
塞车又担心擦撞尽是惊险划面
on Waterloo Street, playing chicken with oncoming traffic
your life flashing before your eyes.

272
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:36,307
我喝太多咖啡了
I've obviously had too much coffee, huh?

273
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:37,577
没关系
It's no problem.

274
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:43,154
我姐姐萝拉来接我们了，谢谢
There's my sister Laurel to pick us up.

275
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,212
不客气

我对女人没兴趣

J.J., what's up, kid?

418
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,795
跟马圭尔谈过了？
Yeah, boy. Have you talked to Maguire?

419
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:07,635
他抓狂了！我先通知你
Homeboy had a meltdown.

420
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:11,435
玉米片广告商很中意你
I was talking to Doritos about you, and they're very interested in you.

421
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:12,870

马丁纳，你好吗？
Martinez.

423
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:18,868
你付25%佣金给SMI
Right now you're paying 25 percent of your endorsements to SMI.

424
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:21,436
我只收7%
I would cut my commission by seven percent.

425
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:25,746
可能他吃错药了，疯了！
I don't wanna say if it was drug-induced, but the guy freaked out.

426
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:29,614
要这种人代表你？你妈好吗？
I don't know if you want a guy like that representing you going into the draft. There. I said my piece.

427
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:32,682
我不给你压力K
I'm gonna make this decision easy for you, okay?

428
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,353
听你的心怎么说
Just what does your heart tell you?

429
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,558
真遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

430
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,168
被开除？他完了！
I can't believe they fired him. He's gone.

431
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:46,064
怎么了？
What's going on?

432
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:48,234
杰瑞马圭尔被开除了
They fired Jerry Maguire.

433

SMI. This is Cleo.

435
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:00,319
你做了错误决定
I think you're making a big mistake.

436
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:03,514
我关心你的家庭和未来
I'm concerned about your family and your future.

437
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,455
你待在这里前途堪虑
If you stay here, I don't know what's gonna happen.

438
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,983
抱歉，我跟SMI关系久远
I'm sorry. I have a longstanding relationship with SMI.

439
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:11,895
你以为马圭尔了解黑人？
Do you think Maguire knows what it's like to be a black guy?

440
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:16,669
巴布休葛？他有趣、滑稽
Bob Sugar? He's... He's an entertaining, funny...

441
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,967
他说我不了解黑人？
I don't know what it's like to be a black person?

442
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:20,505
我就是黑人！
I'm Mr. Black People!

443
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:24,105
别让大家难做人
Like I say, don't make it harder than it is.

444
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:28,314
你的决定令我痛苦
I've gotta be honest with you. This is very personally distressing for me.

445
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:31,875
海滩脱衣舞娘，记得她名字？
I haven't seen you since we were with that stripper. Remember her name?

446
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:35,722
我记得，她叫艾波 我的工作就是记住这一切
I do. It was April. That's my job... to remember the names of skanks you bang on the road.

447
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:38,520
不为钱，只为了你
It's not about the money. I do it all for you.

I want to cry for what they did to you at SMI.

456
00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:03,074
若不是汽车广告我一定跟你走
If we weren't right in the middle of the Acura deal... you know I'd go with you.

事实上我很担心

担心我的合约 巴布休葛打电话给我

他说跟着你麻烦大了

That's how I'm doin'. You know what I'm sayin'?

罗德，稍候好吗？

trying to kill me, I tell myself...

487
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,158
管他的，接球再说

我爱黑人

560
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:56,843
你想怎么做？
- What you gonna do?

561
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,976
让我赚大钱
- Show me the money!

562
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:03,017
恭喜，你仍是我的经纪人

563
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:35,918
别担心

我不会做K你们认为的
I'm not gonna do what you all think I'm gonna do,

566
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:42,591
崩溃！
which is just flip out.

567
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,168
让我说句话K
Let me just say as I...

568
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:54,270
在离开K
ease out of the office...

569
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,399
我胼手胝足开创的公司前
I helped build...

570
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,306
抱歉，但事实上K
I'm sorry, but it's a fact...

571
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:03,573
做人应该有分寸
that there is such a thing as manners.

572
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:07,411
待人的方法
A way of treating people.

573
00:30:10,356 --> 00:30:12,256
这些鱼有分寸
These fish have manners.

574
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:15,488
这些鱼K有分寸
These fish have manners.

575
00:30:15,928 --> 00:30:17,896
事实上，我要带他们走
In fact, they're coming with me.

576
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:19,659
我要开家新公司
I'm starting a new company...

577
00:30:19,732 --> 00:30:21,359
鱼会跟着我
and the fish will come with me.

578
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:24,870
你可以说我感情用事
You can call me sentimental.

579
00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:28,133
但是鱼将跟着我走
The fish, they're coming with me.

580
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:33,844
来K跟我走
Come on. Come on. You come on.

581

Ok

583
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:47,560
还有谁跟我走？
If anybody else... wants to come with me...

584
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:50,926
重新拓展K
this moment will be the moment of something

585
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:54,360
真实、有趣、具启发性
real...and fun and inspiring...

586
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,098
我们共同开创之路
in this godforsaken business... and we will do it together.

587
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:04,170
谁跟我走？
Who's coming with me?

588
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:05,801
谁跟我走？
Who's coming with me?

589
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:09,438
谁跟我走？
Who's coming with me?

590
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,487
谁跟我走除了K
Who's coming with me besides...

591
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:17,379
这只“飞宝”？
Flipper here?

592
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:25,654
真丢脸
This is embarrassing.

593
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,369
好吧
All right.

594
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:35,032
温蒂K
Wendy

595
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:36,701
走吧？

596
00:31:36,976 --> 00:31:41,446
杰瑞K再三个月我就加薪了
I'm three months away from the pay increase.

597
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:49,984
好吧K
Okey

598
00:31:58,431 --> 00:31:59,921
我跟你走
I will go with you.

599
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:03,895
桃乐丝波伊，谢谢你！
Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

600
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:12,702
现在？
Right now?

601
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:18,078
别去！
Don't do it.

602
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:25,145
再见
Bye.

603
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,794
各位再见了
We'll see you all again.

604
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,799
祝好梦
Sleep tight.

605
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,101
再见
Bye.

606
00:32:40,873 --> 00:32:43,137
少了我们看他们怎么办
Let's see how they do without us.

607
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:58,689
谢谢
Thank you.

608
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,515
我不该现在问K
I know this is a bad time,

609
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:03,152
你有医疗保险吧？
but you will have a medical program?

610
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:05,094
当然，医疗？
Sure, yes, medical.

611
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:08,197
我不确定
I don't know what l...

612
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:13,203
回想刚才的决定时，别惊慌
When you think about what you did there, don't panic.

613
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:16,537
不会有事的，会顺利渡过
We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be great.

614
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:19,940
我们会成功
We're gonna be... great.

615
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:22,710
会的
Yes.

616
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:55,340
不知他说了些什么
I wonder what he said.

617
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:58,248
我姑妈会手语
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired.

618
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:01,315
他说：你让我更完美
He just said, "You complete me."

619
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,838
我们都遇到麻烦了
We've all got a problem.

620
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:22,273
我们被困在某种模式
We're all stuck in some kind of pattern.

621
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:25,368
他说得很有道理K
- It's true. - She was making an excellent point.

622
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:27,969
我们聚会是为了互相帮助
We have come here to support one another...

623
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:30,572
但大家却各说各话
and we don't even listen to one another.

624
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:35,348
女人看女人都不顺眼
Women are taught not to see each other as good people.

625
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,048
女人把女人当敌人
We see each other as the enemy.

626
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:39,556
为争男人，为了K
We're competition for men.

627
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,422
没错！女人的战争
It's true. We have this terrible competition thing going on.

628
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:45,431
以前我真的很讨厌女人
I really, really hated women,

629
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:49,299
直到遇到你们，跟我一样的人
and then I met you guys...and you're like, you know, me.

630
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:53,702
这很重要，因为你们是我朋友
And it's important because I know that you can be my friends.

631
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:55,065
医疗保险呢？
- What about medical?

632
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,165
当然有
- Of course medical.

633
00:34:57,243 --> 00:34:59,871
单亲妈妈不能草率行事
You are a single mother. You have given up the right to be frivolous.

634
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:03,142
看过他的文章你也会像我一样
If you had read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.

635
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:05,445
我可以回圣地牙哥工作
I can always take that job in San Diego.

636
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,916
你知道儿童体检多少钱？
Do you know how much those Well-Child exams cost?

637
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:09,648
150元
- $150. - Yes, that's right.

638
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,383
没错，没生病时
And that's just when he's well.

639
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:12,924
雷呢？
Where is Ray?

640
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:14,186
在客厅睡觉
- Asleep in the living room.

641
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,625
真是的！
- That's wonderful.

642
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:17,787
下次要训话K
The next time you decide to lecture me...

643
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:20,730
别把我儿子丢在离婚妇女堆中
don't leave my boy with that divorced women's group.

644
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:25,695
我终于知道为什么生气了
So I finally got in touch with my anger.

645
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:28,262
太棒了！爱丽丝
Yeah! You go, Alice!

646
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:33,768
她怎么了？
- What's her problem?

647
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,677
她辞职了
- Quit her job.

648
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:37,939
天！我做了什么？
My God, what did I do?

649
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:41,677
运作、不停运作
Function, function, function.

650
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:46,015
行动最重要！克许是救兵
Forward motion is everything. Cush saves all.

651
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:47,954
去德州
You go to Texas.

652
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:50,757
留住明星球员别人都会跟来
You keep one superstar, and they'll all follow.

653
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:52,660
世上没有忠诚
- There's no real loyalty. - None.

654
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:55,757
只有你跟我说过这两个字
And the first person who told me that was you.

655
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,592
当时想跟你上床
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.

656
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:02,272
目的达到！我绝不让你失败
Well, it worked. And I will not let you fail.

657
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,071
你是杰瑞“他妈的”马圭尔
You areJerry Ma-fuckin'-guire!

658
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:06,372
没错

今天花很多时间与你们相处
I'm here today. We spent a lot of time together.

673
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:09,801
我关心你和你儿子

通常我不拥抱人

677

我告诉自己
I told myself,

679
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,557
他出现，我们就跟着他
"He shows up, we stick with him."

680

我要他上场打球

686
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,981
丹佛与圣地牙哥都抢着签约
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.

687
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,244

693
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,593
我一言九鼎
and it's stronger than oak.

694
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,673
I was so tired

00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:40,625
杰瑞，我的广告呢？
Where are my endorsements? You know what I'm saying?

792
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:45,100
汽车广告不找我 饮料广告不找我
I didn't get no love from Chevy. I didn't get no love from Pepsi.

793
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,731
连电磁广告都不找我

我说过雷霸的故事吗？
Did I ever tell you my Reebok story?

797

去他的雷霸！根本不甩我

总是这样，一直如此！

刚才你表现得很好
You know what was great about you down there?

803
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,668
因为你没有摆出排斥的态度
For about five minutes, you unloaded that rather large chip... that resides right there on your shoulder.

804
00:44:16,668 --> 00:44:18,192
你接受别人
You let people in.

现在爱我了吧？
You're loving me now, aren't you?

811
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,915
除了爱还要让你赚大钱
I'm not about love. I'm about showing you the money.

812
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:35,009
我试试你忘了没
I was just testing you, Jerry.

We have a decision to make.

824

San Diego just came in with a last minute scenario. It's big.

825
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:13,213
他要做排名第一的球员
Well, he's got to go number one.

826
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:17,886
会的，圣地牙哥尽力争取他
He goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade him up with Denver... and they want him bad.

827
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:19,924
丹佛呢？
What happened to Denver?

828
00:45:19,998 --> 00:45:22,558

832
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:33,843
是记者，不断打电话来
Reporters. They've been calling all night.

833
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:35,971
你和气的说“不予置评”
Just be friendly and say, "No comment."

834
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:37,446
12小时后宣布
We'll tell the world in 12 hours.

835
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:41,450
言不及义的话我不在行
Talking and saying nothing, man... it is an art I have not mastered.

836
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,420
让我来
Well, let me do it. Wait.

837
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:47,222
为你们，我很乐意
For you, it's a pleasure.

838
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:50,452
我是克许
This is Cush.

839
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,620
我是休葛，马圭尔在哪吗？
It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?

840
00:45:52,697 --> 00:45:54,892
在的话你就吸吸鼻子
Just sniff if he's there.

841
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,428
好吧！记得K
All right, buddy. Just remember, you're swimming with the big boys now.

842
00:45:57,502 --> 00:46:00,372
签约的事让你爸爸谈
Let your dad do all the talking.

843
00:46:00,372 --> 00:46:02,704
我才有你们要的合约
I got you the deal you needed.

844
00:46:02,774 --> 00:46:04,765
这是生意别谈友情
This is business, not friendship.

845
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:09,246
坚强点，你是国际巨星了
You gotta be strong 'cause you're global now, worldwide.

846
00:46:09,314 --> 00:46:10,872
好吗？
Okay, buddy?

847
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:13,380
待会见，再见
I'll see you later. Bye.

848
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:19,317
不予置评
No comment.

849
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:27,496
报导不正确
- He's got it all wrong.

850
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:29,192
克许又上电视了
- It's Cush on the big TV again.

851
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:30,825
我看腻了
I'm sick of me already.

852
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:32,096
我患克许恐惧症
I've got "Cushlash."

853
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:34,298
克许恐惧症
Cushlash

854
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,675
麦特，我去跟丹佛谈之前K
Now, Matt, before I go back to Denver...

855
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:51,552
我们先签经纪契约如何？
we should put something down on paper. Something that says, "I'm with Jerry Maguire."

856
00:46:51,623 --> 00:46:52,954
现在不行
Not right now.

857
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:02,964
发生什么事了吗？
Do I know everything there is to know here?

858
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:10,804
你没跟巴布休葛谈过吧？
You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?

859
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:15,175
丹佛队想经由他，不是你
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.

860
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:17,644
谁说的？
Said who?

861
00:47:17,716 --> 00:47:18,876
休葛？
Sugar?

862
00:47:19,784 --> 00:47:21,752
我不太懂
I'm learning as I go here.

863
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,847
你跟巴布休葛暗中交涉？
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?

864
00:47:27,192 --> 00:47:29,353
抱歉
I'm sorry.

865
00:47:30,562 --> 00:47:31,893
我爱我儿子
- I love my son.

866
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:34,227
我爱你儿子！我爱你儿子
- I love your son. I love your son!

867
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:38,695
我提议2千万，丹佛同意
I brought Denver to 20 million. Denver deals with me all the time.

868
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,068
居然听巴布休葛的？
You listened to Sugar.

869
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:43,300
巴布休葛太嫩了
Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child.

870
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:46,572
你听这种小人指引？
You let that snake in the door?

871
00:47:49,414 --> 00:47:52,906
算了，别提了
This is a rookie mistake.

872
00:47:52,984 --> 00:47:56,044
你要丹佛，我替你安排
You want Denver. I'll fix this whole thing up for you.

873
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:58,521
没跟休葛签契约吧？
You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right?

874
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:02,290
麦特
Matt

875
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:06,058
说你没有签K
Tell me you didn't sign.

876
00:48:06,898 --> 00:48:13,094
因为我仍相信你一言九鼎
Tell me you didn't sign 'cause I'm still sort of moved... by your " My word is stronger than oak" thing.

877
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:17,605
一小时前签的
We signed an hour ago.

878
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:20,509
你在大厅K
You were in the lobby

879
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:23,275
跟黑人在一起
with the black fella.

880
00:48:25,717 --> 00:48:27,241
杰瑞，抱歉
I'm sorry, Jerry.

881
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:29,218
我只想踢足球
I just wanna play football.

882
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,854
怎么办？怎么解释？
What do I do? How do I spin this?

883
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:37,451
得了！谁不知道？
Honey, it's spun.

884
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:40,255
为什么这样对我？
What did I do to you?

885
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:41,764
总是我、我、我！
It's all about you, isn't it?

886
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:44,893
安慰我、救我、爱我
- "Soothe me, save me, love me." - Stop moving.

887
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:46,869
- 别走来走去 - 我必须工作
- Could you stop moving? - I have to finish my job.

888
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:49,771
我们正吵得面红耳赤
Everything is on the fucking run with us.

889
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:53,436
杰瑞，我们是销售员，卖东西
Jerry, you and I are salespeople. We sell.

890
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:55,138
不是“爱我”
It's not "Love me."

891
00:48:55,213 --> 00:48:56,805
不是“信任我的友情”
It's not "Trust my handshake."

892
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:00,783
签字、售出，有什么难的？
It's "Make the sale," "Get it signed." There shouldn't be confusion about that.

893
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:03,650
不帮我还泼冷水
Just jump right into my nightmare. The water is warm.

894
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:06,019
不讲诚实了？我不能诚实？
So honesty is outlawed here? I can't be honest?

895
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:08,423
现在该讲忠心
I would prefer loyalty.

896
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,659
当初我们就说好实话实说
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?

897
00:49:14,332 --> 00:49:16,857
没说要这么残忍
I think you added the "brutal."

898
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:21,395
有些人特别敏感
There is a sensitivity thing that some people have.

899
00:49:21,473 --> 00:49:22,701
我不敏感
I don't have it.

900
00:49:22,774 --> 00:49:24,503
看电影我不会哭
I don't cry at movies.

901
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:28,313
我不喜欢小孩子 我不提前五个月过圣诞
I don't gush over babies. I don't start celebrating Christmas five months early.

902
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:32,147
更不会对搞砸的人说：小可怜
And I don't tell a man who just screwed up both our lives, "Poor baby."

903
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,850
这就是我，不喜欢拉倒
That's me, for better or worse.

904
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,920
但我真的爱你
But I do love you.

905
00:49:41,926 --> 00:49:45,554
艾芙瑞，结束了 我没听清楚
- Avery? - No. - It's over. - Didn't hear it.

906
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:48,599
我们间缺少些东西
There's something missing here, don't you think?

907
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:50,095
你没独处过
- You have never been alone.

908
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:50,896
听我说K
- Listen to me.

909
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:52,197
你无法独处
- And you can't be alone.

910
00:49:52,537 --> 00:49:54,368
结束了
- It's over.

911
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,802
没人甩过我
No one has ever dumped me.

912
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:04,272
我并不想这么做
I'm not trying to make history here.

913
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:10,546
一般人爬凯比坦山要23小时 我只花了18小时23分
I did the 23-hour nose route... to the top of El Capitan in 18 hours and 23 minutes.

914
00:50:10,622 --> 00:50:12,283
我也能让你回心转意
I can make this work.

915
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,325
不会
No.

916
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:20,424
杰瑞
Jerry

917
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,740
我不想伤害你
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

918
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,988
你伤不了我
I won't let you hurt me.

919
00:50:44,055 --> 00:50:46,649
我太强了，失败者！
I'm too strong for you, loser.

920
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:50,928
去你的
Fuck.

921
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,157
被打爬起来，开始新的一天
Roll with the punches. Tomorrow's another day.

922
00:50:57,635 --> 00:50:58,329
计程车
Taxi!

923
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,802
你现在爱我了吧？
You lovin' me now, aren't you?

924
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:05,273
非常爱，计程车
Very much. Taxi!

925
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,146
没搞错？不是高级轿车？
Is it my imagination, or didn't we arrive in a limo?

926
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:10,880
问题是K
The question I have is this...

927
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:14,146
我不是心理医生
I hope this doesn't come off too much like I'm a shrink.

928
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:17,118
怎么了？
What's wrong?

929
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:19,816
我觉得非常失望
- Man, I'm just a big disappointment.

930
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:20,789
你看
- Look at this.

931
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:25,663
- 无法改变 - 每个人都在节目上哭
Can't change it. Everybody cries on this show. Can't change it.

932
00:51:25,663 --> 00:51:28,393
爱滋病？别吸毒嘛！
You mad you tested positive? Quit doing blow.

933
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,425
生女儿的气？
Upset about your baby girl?

934
00:51:31,803 --> 00:51:34,431
谁要你离婚？老婆很好啊
Why'd you leave her mother? I knew her. She was all right.

935
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:39,533
媒体不了解我的压力 是5千4百万
People, like the media, don't understand... what kind of problems and pressures 54 million come with.

936
00:51:39,611 --> 00:51:41,340
狗屁不通！
- This is some bullshit.

937
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:42,970
你为什么跟着我？
- What are you doing with me, Rod?

938
00:51:43,082 --> 00:51:45,175
我的生活是这么糟糕
I'm still poor in life.

939
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,012
什么？
- What?

940
00:51:46,084 --> 00:51:47,312
你看不出来吗？
- Don't you even see?

941
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:52,691
我完了K大势已去
I'm finished. I am fucked.

942
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,924
24小时前K我炙手可热
Twenty-four hours ago, man, I was hot.

943
00:51:56,995 --> 00:51:58,257
现在K
Now...

944
00:51:59,297 --> 00:52:00,821
我成了最佳的失败例子
I'm a cautionary tale.

945
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:03,625
这件夹克，你喜欢吗？
See this jacket I'm wearing? You like it?

946
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:06,761
我不要了，因为我是失败者！
'Cause I don't really need it because I'm cloaked in failure!

947
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:10,629
我失去了选秀排名第一的客户
I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft!

948
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:12,810
为什么？回想一下
Why? Let's recap.

949
00:52:12,877 --> 00:52:17,644
因为受伤球员的儿子让我内疚
Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk.

950
00:52:17,715 --> 00:52:21,947
吃完披萨上床突然良心发现
I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed and grew a conscience!

951
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:25,420
真令人同情
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.

952
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:31,356
我的职业生涯顶多只有十年
I got a shelf life of ten years, tops.

953
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:36,868
下次签约赚的钱要能用很久
My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars... that'll last me and mine a very long time.

954
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:39,462
再五年就得离开球坛了
Shit, I'm out of this sport in five years.

955
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,528
我的家人怎么办？
What's my family gonna live on?

956
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:45,305
全靠你了
Huh? You get me?

957
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:47,535
我不想听你诉苦
So I don't wanna hear your shit.

958
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,580
我不想听K
I don't wanna hear your

959
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:52,741
我失去克许、艾芙瑞，狗屁！
"Oh, I lost Cush, Avery" and shit.

960
00:52:52,817 --> 00:52:55,183
再来一杯
Can I have another drink, please?

961
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:58,779
别的客户都离开你
Anybody else would've left you by now...

962
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:02,393
我不会离开你，我保证
but I'm sticking with you. I said I would.

963
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:06,659
我要鞭策你让我赚大钱
And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you gonna show me the money.

964
00:53:06,731 --> 00:53:08,392
你得让我赚大钱
You gonna show me the money.

965
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:14,038
我们一起努力
Shit. We together on this. You know what I'm sayin'?

966
00:53:14,038 --> 00:53:15,699
合而为一
We gonna be one.

967
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:20,901
团结合作，懂吗？
The both of us. You know?

968
00:53:21,212 --> 00:53:23,146
天啊！
Oh, my God.

969
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:30,180
没有电话留言
You have no messages.

970
00:53:56,381 --> 00:53:58,246
- 他要过来 - 今晚？
- He's coming over. - Tonight?

971
00:53:58,316 --> 00:54:01,513
他失去大客户，我邀他过来
He just lost his best client. I invited the guy over.

972
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:03,516
桃乐丝，这个人患了并发症
Dorothy, this is not a guy.

973

前中年期挫败症候群
It's a syndrome: Early-midlife- hangin'-on-to-the-bottom-rung...

974
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:08,749
天！别让我孤单
dear-God-don't-let-me-be-alone...

975
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:11,659
打通电话 给苦闷无医疗保险的新助理
I'll-call-my-long-suffering-assistant- without-medical-for-company syndrome.

976
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:14,960
你仍让他来，我也没办法
Lf, knowing all that, you still want him to come over, I'm not saying a thing.

977
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,897
他订婚了
Honey, he's engaged.

978
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:21,564
我第一次在工作上有参与感
For the first time in my career, I'm part of something I believe in.

979

好吧，他最好别太帅！
Okay. But he better not be good-looking!

980

正如我想像中的
You are just the way I pictured you.

984
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,990
我是反对你来的人
I'm her disapproving sister, Laurel.

985

小砘锬兀
Where's the little guy?

993
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:13,255
睡觉了

994
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,518
很高兴你在家
I'm so glad you're home.

995
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:21,388
你知道我不擅长独处
That alone thing is not my specialty.

996
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,964
天啊！
Oh, my God.

997
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:24,793
是啊
Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

998
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,204
我跟艾芙瑞分手了
Well, I broke up with Avery.

999
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,345
只是
It's just...

1000
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:38,112
真遗憾
Gosh, you know, that's too bad.

1001
00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:41,083
不，这样更好K
No, it's better because...

1002
00:55:41,152 --> 00:55:44,349
大家还是朋友总比最后K
we're still gonna be friends, and it's better now than later.

1003
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:45,616
对，当然
Sure. Sure.

1004
00:55:48,726 --> 00:55:49,886
身心创
- I'm dying here, aren't I?

1005
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:52,555
伤得很深
- Yeah, it's a really bad cut.

1006
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,224
还好没买她真正喜欢的戒指
Well, just think if I'd got her the ring she really wanted.

1007
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:04,134
你何不坐一下？
- Yeah. - Why don't you have a seat?

1008
00:56:04,942 --> 00:56:09,637
我拿些消炎药来
I'll... I'll get some aloe vera for that cut.

1009
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:13,243

1010
00:56:13,317 --> 00:56:14,181
有
- Sure.

1011
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:21,490
我听到了
- I heard. - No kidding.

1012
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:26,359
当然，你在门后偷听
I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the kitchen doorway.

1013
00:56:26,397 --> 00:56:29,195
现在给他母猪他也要
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.

1014
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,926
别用玻璃杯，用冰冻杯
Don't use those. Use the frosted glasses.

1015
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:34,937
谢谢
- Thank you.

1016
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:35,665
别客气

1017
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,298
我帮你热鸡肉
I warmed up some of that chicken with salsa for you.

1018

我太爱你了
That's the girl I love.

1019
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:42,272
我不多说，只说这句K
I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna say this.

1020
00:56:42,346 --> 00:56:44,439
你对雷一直克尽母职
You have always been very responsible with Ray.

1021
00:56:44,515 --> 00:56:48,884
别让他醒来看到陌生男子
It's not right for him to wake up and hear a strange man's voice in the house.

1022
00:56:48,953 --> 00:56:49,783
喝醉的K
- Some drunken stranger.

1023
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:52,049
比十个愤怒女人糟？
- As opposed to ten angry women?

1024
00:56:54,525 --> 00:56:55,822
向前倾
Lean forward.

1025
00:56:55,893 --> 00:56:57,884
我接住了

有没有梦到我啊？
You should be dreamin' about me, baby.

1038
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:47,444
我要你不断想着我
I should be on your mind constantly. My agent should be thinking Rod Tidwell.

1039
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:50,241
这样钱就会滚滚而来
That's when big dollars are gonna flow,

1040
00:57:50,314 --> 00:57:52,578
美好境界将会实现

Which top, high turtleneck sensible or low V-neck sexy?

1053
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:20,739
别要我实际点
- Turtleneck, turtleneck. Come on. - Don't tell me to be practical.

1054
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:24,008
跟我同年龄的人都在做什么？

都比不上看好书或洗热水澡
All of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath.

不客气
- Sure.

1104
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:44,412
好
Okay.

1105
01:00:44,455 --> 01:00:46,082
饮料、食物
Drinks, food,

1106
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,618
还叫了计程车
and I called you a cab.

1107
01:00:49,894 --> 01:00:51,361
好主意
Good idea.

1108
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:54,022
小声一点，雷正在睡觉
We should keep our voices down. I have a little boy asleep.

1109
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,262
对
Right.

1110
01:00:57,935 --> 01:00:59,232
敬我们公司
Our company.

1111
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:02,106
好
Yeah.

1112
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:08,067
我走前想告诉你K
Okay, okay. Look. A little speech before I go.

1113
01:01:13,584 --> 01:01:18,649
别担心未来
Do not worry... about your future.

1114
01:01:18,689 --> 01:01:21,157
你跟你儿子
You and your son...

1115
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:25,252
我们会平安渡过，你仍有工作
We are just fine. You still have a job.

1116
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:31,565
让我告诉你杰瑞马圭尔这个人
But let me tell you something aboutJerry Maguire, okay?

1117
01:01:31,635 --> 01:01:36,072
谁想跟我斗都输定了
You come after me, and you will lose.

1118
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,535
因为我能克服万难，打不倒
Because I am a survivor. I'm a survivor.

1119
01:01:41,779 --> 01:01:44,077
桃乐丝波伊K
Dorothy Boyd...

1120
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:47,675
你跟随的是谈判高手
you are with the lord of the living room...

1121
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:53,417
是体坛的王牌，我K
the king... of the Kingdome, and I am...

1122
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,458
喝醉了
drunk.

1123
01:02:07,738 --> 01:02:09,638
又见面了
We meet again.

1124
01:02:24,054 --> 01:02:25,282
来擦药
Here.

1125
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:36,121
想听实话？
The truth?

1126
01:02:38,235 --> 01:02:39,224
好
- Sure.

1127
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:43,341
我关心我的工作
- I care about the job...of course...

1128
01:02:43,374 --> 01:02:46,969
但我更想被启发
but mostly I just wanna be inspired.

1129
01:02:48,846 --> 01:02:49,904
我也是
Me too.

1130
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,515
你的文章启发了我
What you wrote inspired me.

1131
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:55,380
不K
No

1132
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:58,555
我跟着你是因为那篇备忘录
I'm working with you because of that memo.

1133
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:02,893
我爱那篇备忘录
I loved that memo.

1134
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:08,163
那是工作感言
It was a mission statement.

1135
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:24,240
当然
Well.

1136
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:26,682
抱歉手乱放
Sorry about the hand.

1137
01:03:30,921 --> 01:03:33,890
你了解那种感觉？
Do you know that feeling...

1138
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,425
你K
you're not...

1139
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:41,257
现在不很糗，但明天会很糗
completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpse... tomorrow's embarrassment?

1140
01:03:41,298 --> 01:03:43,858
别放心上K老板
Don't worry about it, boss.

1141
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:47,362
惨了！你叫我老板
Oh, shit. You said "boss."

1142
01:03:47,438 --> 01:03:49,235
没错
Yeah, I did.

1143
01:03:49,306 --> 01:03:50,500
藉职权占便宜
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

1144
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:53,270
不K别这么想
Don't feel like Clarence Thomas.

1145
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:58,182
我觉得我现在就在骚扰你
I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm, like, harassing you right now.

1146
01:03:58,983 --> 01:04:00,575
我不会告你
Well, I may not sue.

1147
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:14,596
晚安
Good evening.

1148
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:15,890
晚安
Good evening.

1149
01:04:18,702 --> 01:04:21,933
别担心，好吗？别K
Look, don't worry, okay? I mean, don't...

1150
01:04:24,008 --> 01:04:25,134
没事的
We're gonna be okay...

1151
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,939
我会将唯一客户
because I am gonna take my one client...

1152
01:04:29,013 --> 01:04:32,244
推向胜利巅峰
and we are gonna go all the way.

1153
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,549
我振作了
'Cause, hey... I'm back.

1154
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:41,786
别K担心
Don't worry.

1155
01:04:57,307 --> 01:04:59,867
罗德，加油！接得好！
Way to go, Rod. Good catch, man. Good catch.

1156
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:05,016
干得好
All right. Good job.

1157
01:05:07,985 --> 01:05:10,044
丹尼，来谈谈他的合约
We gotta talk about his contract, Dennis.

1158
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:12,847
晚上八点鳄鱼酒吧见
Meet me at the Crocodile, 8:00.

1159
01:05:14,058 --> 01:05:15,286
没问题
You bet.

1160
01:05:35,646 --> 01:05:36,908
谢谢
Thank you.

1161
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,882
你迷路了？否则你不会不来
Tell me you got lost last night, because I know you wouldn't do that to a friend.

1162
01:05:40,951 --> 01:05:42,282
突然有事
- Something came up. - Well, it's okay.

1163
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:45,022
好，1千万签4年
- Ten million dollars for four years. - It's early.

1164
01:05:45,022 --> 01:05:46,614
你还没睡醒
- You're still dreaming.

1165
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:47,987
1千万4年，一言为定
- Ten for four, it's a deal.

1166
01:05:48,058 --> 01:05:52,096
这砘锏奶度很差
The guy has got an attitude problem.

1167
01:05:52,096 --> 01:05:55,088
他听我的，我跟他沟通
He listens to me. I can help you with that.

1168
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:56,325
他是个矮子
He's a shrimp.

1169
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,767
罗德将打破你球队的记录
Shrimp? Rod Tidwell broke every receiving record you had last year.

1170
01:05:59,837 --> 01:06:02,203
我要普通的接球员
I want a prototypical wide receiver,

1171
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:04,035
身材适当的接球员
somebody who's 6'3", 220...

1172
01:06:04,108 --> 01:06:07,339
不是这么矮又爱抱怨的
not some guy who's 5'10" and bitches in the locker room.

1173
01:06:07,411 --> 01:06:10,437
我请你K
I'm asking you...

1174
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:13,845
帮我个忙
for a favor.

1175
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:16,378
你太太是我介绍的
I introduced you to your wife.

1176
01:06:16,453 --> 01:06:21,692
我们曾共渡圣诞K
We've spent Christmases together. Holiday cheer, Dennis.

1177
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:23,319
杰瑞，你走投无路了
Jerry, you're reaching.

1178
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,157
我请你帮个忙
I'm asking you for a favor!

1179
01:06:26,363 --> 01:06:28,854
别这样！多年老友了
Don't do this to me. We have history, Dennis.

1180
01:06:28,932 --> 01:06:30,991
没错，多年老友
We got history, all right.

1181
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:33,901
这几年你不断提高价码
You drove the prices up on me for years.

1182
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:36,735
现在该你尝尝滋味
Now it's your turn to spend some time at the back of the line.

1183
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:39,810
不K丹尼K
Dennis, don't...

1184
01:06:43,981 --> 01:06:47,542
我跟丹尼谈过续约问题
I started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotiation this morning.

1185
01:06:52,589 --> 01:06:53,453
谈？
Talking?

1186
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:58,562
管他莱斯、安德瑞、克斯卡
Jerry Rice. Andre Reed. Chris Carter.

1187
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:00,325
都不是我对手！
- I smoke all these fools! - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1188
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:03,956
但他们赚得比我多
Yet they are makin' the big, sweet dollar.

1189
01:07:04,034 --> 01:07:06,093
他们拥有“宽”
They are makin' the kwan.

1190
01:07:06,703 --> 01:07:08,568
你却只在谈
And you're talkin'.

1191
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:14,407
你说“宽”？
Kwan? That's your word?

1192
01:07:14,478 --> 01:07:16,070
我是这么说
Hell, yeah, that's my word.

1193
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:19,912
有些人有钱却得不到“宽”
Some dudes might have the coin, but they'll never have the kwan.

1194
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,512
什么意思？
What is...

1195
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:24,019
就是爱、尊重K
It means love, respect...

1196
01:07:24,288 --> 01:07:27,189
地位和金钱一切的一切
community, and the dollars too... the entire package.

1197
01:07:27,257 --> 01:07:29,987
“宽”
The kwan.

1198
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:32,593
好棒的字
Great word.

1199
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:35,592
要毛巾？
Towel?

1200
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,293
不，自然干
No, I air dry.

1201
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:40,162
罗德K
Listen, Rod.

1202
01:07:40,804 --> 01:07:44,708
我慎重的跟你说K
I say this with great respect for you...

1203
01:07:45,642 --> 01:07:48,008
你刚才提的那些球员
but those players you mentioned, Rod...

1204
01:07:48,078 --> 01:07:49,636
他们都是轴心球员
they're marquee players...

1205
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:53,513
这次谈的K
and this deal...

1206
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:55,142
轴心？
- You know, we... - Marquee?

1207
01:07:55,285 --> 01:07:57,981
我要说的是K这次是续约
Here's what I'm saying. This is a renegotiation.

1208
01:07:58,055 --> 01:08:00,080
想赚钱就要卖力
We want more from them, so let's give them more.

1209
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:05,729
表现实力，丢开坏脾气K
Let's show them your pure joy of the game. Let's bury the attitude a little bit and show them...

1210
01:08:05,729 --> 01:08:06,559
等一下！
Wait.

1211
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:09,121
你要我去奉承？
- You're telling me to dance. - No.

1212
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:11,969
不！我是说K
I'm saying

1213
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:15,539
找回当初热爱足球的你
to get back to the guy...who first started playing this game.

1214
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:20,568
记得小时候？不是只为钱吧？
Remember way back when, when you were a kid? It wasn't just about the money, was it?

1215
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:23,307
是吗？
Was it?

1216
01:08:24,615 --> 01:08:25,980
是吗？
Was it?

1217
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:29,012
做好你份内的事
Do your job.

1218
01:08:29,553 --> 01:08:31,521
别叫我去奉承
Don't you tell me to dance.

1219
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:33,715
随你便
Fine. Fine!

1220
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,351
我是运动员！不是演员！
I am an athlete. I am not an entertainer!

1221
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:38,325
随便！
- Fine!

1222
01:08:38,395 --> 01:08:40,158
我很在意这种事！
- These are the ABC's of me, baby.

1223
01:08:40,397 --> 01:08:44,265
我不奉承、没续约我不练球
I do not dance, and I do not start preseason without a contract.

1224
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:46,700
随便K
Fine! Fine! Fine!

1225
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,169
杰瑞，跟我说话K
Jerry, talk to me.

1226
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:50,597
呼吸
Breathe.

1227
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:52,073
深呼吸
Breathe, Jerry.

1228
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:57,006
我来这里只为了你
I am out here for you.

1229
01:08:57,547 --> 01:09:00,778
你无法体会我此刻的心情
You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you.

1230
01:09:00,851 --> 01:09:05,220
彻夜无眠、尊严放一边K
It is an up-at-dawn, pride-swallowing siege...

1231
01:09:05,289 --> 01:09:08,417
苦思如何才能让你明了
that I will never fully tell you about, okay?

1232
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:13,993
帮助我！
Just... God, help me!

1233
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:15,926
罗德，帮我！
Help me, Rod.

1234
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:18,126
帮我K帮你
Help me help you.

1235
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:22,436
帮助我K帮你
Help me help you.

1236
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,703
帮我来帮助你
Help me help you.

1237
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:34,778
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1238
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:39,553
你看来快崩溃了
You are hanging on by a very thin thread.

1239
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:43,588
我喜欢你那德行
I dig that about you!

1240
01:09:45,162 --> 01:09:46,060
没合约？
No contract?

1241
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:48,825
帮我？我帮你帮大家
"Help me, help me!"

1242
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:52,266
真有一套！
That's my man!

1243
01:09:53,003 --> 01:09:54,595
很高兴能取悦你
Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

1244
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:57,105
帮我！帮我！
Help me! Help me!

1245
01:09:58,408 --> 01:09:59,773
洛杉矶见了
I'll see you in Los Angeles.

1246
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:02,141
杰瑞，别这样！
Come on, man.

1247
01:10:03,313 --> 01:10:06,305
这就是我们的差别
Hey, see, that's the difference between us.

1248
01:10:06,383 --> 01:10:09,580
你认为我们交恶K 我认为我们终于沟通了
You think we're fightin', and I think we're finally talkin'.

1249
01:10:14,825 --> 01:10:16,918
除非你爱每一个人K
Unless you love everybody,

1250
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:19,086
否则什么都卖不出去
you can't sell anybody.

1251
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,629
丹尼打电话来说K
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say...

1252
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:33,369
星期四上午传真合约来
he's faxing in the new offer for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

1253
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:35,843
他说你会开心K高兴
And he said you'd be happy. Glad.

1254
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:37,971
他说开心还是高兴？
Did he say "happy" or "glad"?

1255
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:41,512
高兴，他说高兴
Glad. He said glad. Glad.

1256
01:10:43,253 --> 01:10:45,517
高兴也好
Glad is good.

1257
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:48,183
对，我们需要那笔佣金
- Glad's good. - We could sure use that commission.

1258
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:51,750
这是财务收支状况
Here, I did a rundown on where you stand financially.

1259
01:10:55,165 --> 01:10:57,224
我把钱投资到房地产K
I sunk most of what I had into this condo.

1260
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,495
不用解释
- You don't have to explain. - It devalued and...

1261
01:11:01,037 --> 01:11:03,198
那天晚上K
Look, the other night...

1262
01:11:03,273 --> 01:11:04,831
我想道歉
I want to apologize.

1263
01:11:05,442 --> 01:11:07,000
怎么回事？
Yeah, what happened there?

1264
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:10,308
一起工作最好别有怪气氛
We're two people working together. We can't have atmosphere.

1265
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:13,072
对，你说得很对
No, I'm really relieved that you said that.

1266
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:16,642
那天晚上我只是K寂寞
The other night, I was lonely...

1267
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,018
以为你了解
and I felt you understood something.

1268
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:22,987
但言归正传K
- But we've got a company to think about. - Yes.

1269
01:11:23,126 --> 01:11:26,254
我绝不会再占你便宜
I will never take advantage of you in that way again.

1270
01:11:26,496 --> 01:11:27,155
好
- Good.

1271
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:32,134
你为我辞去工作，我却这样？ 帐目表正确吗？
- You walked out on a job for me. This is how I repay you? Can this be right?

1272
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:34,260
很正确
Exactly.

1273
01:11:35,539 --> 01:11:39,669
现在最好让你专心工作
This is one of those times when you need to be alone with your thoughts...

1274
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:43,235
想想哪里错了？如何补救？
and think about everything that's gone wrong and how to fix it...

1275
01:11:43,313 --> 01:11:45,338
就是不受打扰
and, you know, just be alone.

1276
01:11:46,016 --> 01:11:47,381
独处
Alone. Alone, alone, alone.

1277
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:52,318
独自一人
Alone.

1278
01:11:53,824 --> 01:11:55,018
晚上一起吃饭？
- You wanna go out to dinner?

1279
01:11:55,091 --> 01:11:57,423
我知道个好餐馆
- I know a great place.

1280
01:11:57,794 --> 01:12:02,466
我跟他分手，他却缠着不放
The guy's an utter loser, so I broke up with him. Then he started stalking me.

1281
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:04,593
怎么缠法？
What's the current definition of stalking?

1282
01:12:04,668 --> 01:12:06,499
未经同意登门拜访
Coming over uninvited.

1283
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:11,138
这么说罗密欧也爱缠人
Coming over uninvited. So Romeo under the balcony is a stalker?

1284
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,540
- 没错 - 别乱扯
- Exactly. - Oh, stop!

1285
01:12:20,652 --> 01:12:23,817
抱歉
Excuse me.

1286
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,548
女士们
Ladies? Ladies?

1287
01:12:26,756 --> 01:12:27,745
晚安
Good evening.

1288
01:12:28,725 --> 01:12:30,989
我找桃乐丝波伊
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

1289
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:33,626
她在厨房
She's in the kitchen.

1290
01:12:34,297 --> 01:12:35,093
萝拉
- Laurel.

1291
01:12:35,232 --> 01:12:36,096
杰瑞
- Jerry. Hi.

1292
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:39,666
你带她去哪里？
So where are you taking her tonight?

1293
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:42,464
你就是保姆？
You're the nanny?

1294
01:12:43,173 --> 01:12:43,969
育儿员
- Au pair.

1295
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,837
育儿员
- Au pair, is it?

1296
01:12:47,511 --> 01:12:48,637
杰瑞
Jerry

1297
01:12:51,414 --> 01:12:52,642
他喜欢你
He likes you.

1298
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:57,412
我的天啊！我有礼物要送你
My goodness. Look, I got some gifts for you.

1299
01:12:58,088 --> 01:13:00,352
想要吗？喜欢礼物吗？
Do you like presents? Good. All right.

1300
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:06,629
亚历桑那队的球帽、球衣
Here's the Arizona Cardinals. It's the team that Rod plays for.

1301
01:13:06,663 --> 01:13:08,528
带脏衣物来洗？
Dropping your laundry off?

1302
01:13:08,598 --> 01:13:10,122
喜欢这顶帽子？
- Would you like a hat? Steelers?

1303
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,189
送我的？
- For me? Wow.

1304
01:13:11,268 --> 01:13:12,792
是啊，还有K
Got some things.

1305
01:13:12,969 --> 01:13:14,300
还有灰色的
Got it in gray too.

1306
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,174
- 杰瑞，谢谢 - 不客气
Thanks, Jerry.

1307
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:19,735
天啊！看这是什么
You're very welcome. Oh, my goodness. Look what I've got here.

1308
01:13:19,776 --> 01:13:22,438
活力糖！让你整晚睡不着觉
This is an energy bar. This will keep you up all night.

1309
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:26,073
最好别给他，给我K
See, that's not a good idea. I'll take that, yeah.

1310
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:27,616
罗拉阿姨吃
Aunt Laurel will eat that for you.

1311
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:32,483
看来雷很喜欢你
Looks like you've got a fan.

1312
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:39,563
这身衣服真华丽出众
Wow. That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

1313
01:13:39,563 --> 01:13:43,932
太久没约会兴奋过度了
I guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults.

1314
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,365
没恶意
- No offense, buddy. -

1315
01:13:45,435 --> 01:13:47,198
见过查德了吗？
Jerry, did you meet Chad? - Chad, Jerry. Jerry, Chad.

1316
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,534
见过了，我这样穿行吗？
- Yeah, we did. Am I dressed okay?

1317
01:13:49,606 --> 01:13:50,698
我不K
I didn't realize...

1318
01:13:54,945 --> 01:13:56,936
别让雷太晚睡，好吗？
Chad, don't let him stay up too late.

1319
01:13:57,013 --> 01:13:58,446
今晚K
Tonight

1320
01:13:58,515 --> 01:14:02,076
我要教雷爵士音乐
I'm going to teach Ray here about jazz.

1321
01:14:02,152 --> 01:14:04,382
好，那会让他很早睡
Good. That'll put him to sleep early.

1322
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:07,079
我也想去
- I wanna go too.

1323
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:11,561
不K跟查德在一起
- Oh, no, sweetheart. You stay here with Chad, okay, and be good?

1324
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:13,119
好乖，亲一个
Give me a kiss.

1325
01:14:14,397 --> 01:14:16,701
我们走，走吧！
- Let's go. - Excuse me.

1326
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:19,732
晚安
Okay. Good night. Good night.

1327
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:21,703
抱一个
Give me a hug.

1328
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:06,284
你先走，车上见
Go ahead. I'll meet you at the car.

1329
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:09,151
你忘了钥匙
- Okay. - Just forgot the keys. No big deal.

1330
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:14,323
从没见他像亲爸爸一样亲别人
That is the first time I have ever seen him kiss a man just like a dad.

1331
01:15:14,557 --> 01:15:16,252
真让人兴奋
- Wasn't that just thrilling?

1332
01:15:16,326 --> 01:15:17,122
是的
- Yeah, it was.

1333
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:19,218
他一定想要爸爸
- He must really have needed that. - Take it easy.

1334
01:15:19,295 --> 01:15:20,785
别哭，去约会别哭
Don't cry at the beginning of a date.

1335
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:22,456
学我等回家再哭
Cry at the end, like I do.

1336
01:15:22,632 --> 01:15:24,224
- 好吗？ - 好
- You all right? - Okay.

1337
01:15:24,634 --> 01:15:27,535
也别让他对着你哭，好吗？
Don't be a shoulder for him to cry on. That's all I'm gonna say. Nothing else.

1338
01:15:27,604 --> 01:15:28,263
好
Okey

1339
01:15:28,338 --> 01:15:30,806
- 钥匙K - 对了
- Keys, keys. - Oh, keys. Okay.

1340
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:33,899
天啊！
Oh, dear.

1341
01:15:59,736 --> 01:16:02,728
你自从遇见我，我就K
Ever since you've met me, I've been...

1342
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:11,244
我倦怠了，就像跟艾芙瑞分手
It was laziness, you know... my breakup with Avery.

1343
01:16:11,314 --> 01:16:13,874
有人说分手不是任何人的错
You say, "It's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right?

1344
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:17,887
才怪！一定有一方做错了
Somebody is always to blame.

1345
01:16:17,887 --> 01:16:20,048
经营感情像工作一样
You go for it like you do a job.

1346
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:21,921
花心血
Work at it.

1347
01:16:22,225 --> 01:16:26,628
也许，不该爱得这么辛苦
But maybe love shouldn't be such hard work.

1348
01:16:27,597 --> 01:16:30,964
也许吧
Yeah, maybe so.

1349
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:36,131
这样的分手也太突然了
It's not every day you say good-bye to a woman like that.

1350
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,736
唱首情歌？
A song for the lovers?

1351
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:41,003
不K谢谢
No, thank you.

1352
01:16:41,077 --> 01:16:42,704
不了，谢谢！
No,

1353
01:16:42,779 --> 01:16:43,973
我们是同事
we work together.

1354
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,445
我们在谈公事，谢谢
Really, guys, this is like an office meeting, but thank you.

1355
01:16:47,884 --> 01:16:49,146
我明白你的意思
But I know what you mean.

1356
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:55,722
并非我的婚姻或之前K
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was any good, even before...

1357
01:16:58,228 --> 01:16:59,320
之前？
Before?

1358
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:03,020
杰瑞
Jerry

1359
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:04,555
什么？
What?

1360
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:07,865
我们别互诉伤心往事
Let's not tell our sad stories.

1361
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:15,842
我马上回来，好吗？
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

1362
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:47,173
会螫人
- I realize you're seeing someone new - They sting.

1363
01:17:47,243 --> 01:17:49,871
把蜜蜂装起来
Let Chad catch the bee in the glass.

1364
01:17:49,946 --> 01:17:51,208
他不会伤蜜蜂
No, he won't hurt him.

1365
01:17:51,281 --> 01:17:52,270
妈妈，我爱你
I love you.

1366
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:55,112
你真善良，我爱你
You've got such a good heart, buddy. I love you.

1367
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,916
Your temperamental, moody side

1368
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:01,288
The one you've always tried to hide from me

1369
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:25,843
该道晚安了
Well, this would be good night.

1370
01:18:27,283 --> 01:18:28,580
晚安
Good night.

1371
01:18:29,652 --> 01:18:31,017
- 明天见 - 再见
- I'll see you tomorrow. - I'll see you tomorrow.

1372
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:32,384
明天很忙
Big day.

1373
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,112
晚安
Well, good night.

1374
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:02,950
晚安
Good night.

1375
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:36,547
哎呀!
Oops.

1376
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:42,723
帮你弄好
Let me fix this.

1377
01:19:42,959 --> 01:19:44,586
好主意
Good idea.

1378
01:20:39,349 --> 01:20:41,374
你最好别进来了
I think you should not come in.

1379
01:20:43,486 --> 01:20:44,714
或K
Or

1380
01:20:44,854 --> 01:20:45,843
进来
come in.

1381
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:50,518
你来决定
Depending on how you feel.

1382
01:20:51,928 --> 01:20:53,623
你来决定
- Same to you. - No.

1383
01:20:53,696 --> 01:20:58,468
不，我一定得进去
I have to go in.

1384
01:20:59,369 --> 01:21:01,098
我住这里
I live here.

1385
01:21:09,512 --> 01:21:10,706
好
Right.

1386
01:21:15,385 --> 01:21:16,943
我进去
I'll come in.

1387
01:21:19,322 --> 01:21:20,311
好
Good.

1388
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:32,363
你确定要这么做？
Are you sure we wanna do this?

1389
01:21:36,906 --> 01:21:38,533
我确定
- Oh, hell, yes. - Yeah.

1390
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:50,208
他呢？今晚好吗？
How is he? Did he have a good night?

1391
01:21:50,286 --> 01:21:52,049
- 好，他睡了 - 很好
- Yeah, he's asleep. - Good.

1392
01:21:52,121 --> 01:21:54,146
你约会还好吗？
- How'd it go with sport boy?

1393
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:55,986
还没结束
- Still going.

1394
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,528
好棒
All right.

1395
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:06,102
你好吗？
How are you?

1396
01:22:09,272 --> 01:22:10,705
好好待她
Treat her right.

1397
01:22:11,674 --> 01:22:12,663
她K
- Yeah. - She's...

1398
01:22:15,078 --> 01:22:15,874
她很好
- She's great. - Yeah.

1399
01:22:18,948 --> 01:22:20,540
还有K
And...

1400
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:24,085
我知道有些奇怪但K
I know this might be a little awkward, but

1401
01:22:25,421 --> 01:22:26,718
我要你用这个
I want you to use this.

1402
01:22:27,223 --> 01:22:29,418
天啊！查德K
Oh, look. God, Chad.

1403
01:22:29,492 --> 01:22:30,891
不K
No

1404

01:22:32,462 --> 01:22:35,963
是戴维斯和科诠的合辑

斯德哥尔摩1963年录制
Stockholm, 1963.

1407
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:41,127
两位爵士大师精华之作
Two masters of freedom playing at a time...

1408
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:47,200
当时酒廊演奏尚未泛滥
before their art was corrupted... by a zillion cocktail lounge performers...

1409
01:22:47,243 --> 01:22:52,010
酒廊演奏破坏本土艺术K
who destroyed the legacy of the only American art form...

1410
01:22:54,217 --> 01:22:55,775
爵士乐
jazz.

1411
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,045
里面还有明葛的作品
I put some Mingus on there too.

1412
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:09,692
没有区隔K
No barriers,

1413
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:10,891
没有界线
no boundaries.

1414
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,430
查德，我懂了
Chad, I got it.

1415
01:23:46,569 --> 01:23:47,763
过来
Come here.

1416
01:24:06,589 --> 01:24:09,422
你知道这会改变一切？
You know this is gonna change everything.

1417
01:24:13,095 --> 01:24:14,756
你保证？
Promise?

1418
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,268
什么鬼音乐？
What is this music?

1419
01:24:57,807 --> 01:24:59,775
我喜欢一大早起床
I love getting up in the morning!

1420
01:24:59,842 --> 01:25:03,710
我拍手说：今天会很棒！
I clap my hands and say, "This is gonna be a great day!"

1421
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:07,612
真是的
Great.

1422
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,480
我不该K这么做
You really needed to do this.

1423
01:25:23,566 --> 01:25:25,397
我去叫他，别担心！
I'm getting him up, so don't worry.

1424
01:25:26,402 --> 01:25:29,838
怎么了？我在等咖啡
What? I'm just waiting for the coffee. I don't care...

1425
01:25:30,606 --> 01:25:31,903
告诉我K
- Just tell me one thing.

1426
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:33,202
不要
- No.

1427
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:41,550
- 你怎么了？ - 我担心你把感情放他身上
- Why are you acting like that? - Because I'm worried. You're putting

1428
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,745
而他却不懂感情为何物
faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going...
might not have an emotional marble in his head.

1429
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:45,844
拜托，若我说K
Laurel, please, if I start talking...

1430
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:46,751
我才拜托！
- You, please.

1431
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:50,059
若是我呢？我想抓住机会？
- What does that make me, Laurel...for taking the opportunity?

1432
01:25:50,059 --> 01:25:53,460
男人失意时会迷失自己
Men are just different people when they're hanging on to the bottom rung.

1433
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:55,554
也许是我占他便宜
Maybe I am taking advantage.

1434
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:57,531
我就是坏人？
Does that make me a bad person? Huh?

1435
01:25:58,968 --> 01:26:04,835
我曾爱上的人现在已经死了
All I know is I found someone, and he was popular and charming and not so nice to me, and he died, okay?

1436
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,865
为何我要放弃他？为什么？
So why should I let this guy go

1437
01:26:06,942 --> 01:26:09,103
我内心不断的说K
when everything in my body says...

1438
01:26:09,178 --> 01:26:11,840
他就是我要的
that this one is the one.

1439
01:26:11,914 --> 01:26:14,906
别激动，只想问些有趣的细节
Take it easy, all right? I was just looking for a few fun details.

1440
01:26:15,551 --> 01:26:17,849
怎么不早说？
Well, why didn't you say so?

1441
01:26:18,888 --> 01:26:22,051
这个你有没有兴趣K
Well, I don't know if you're interested in this one little detail.

1442
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:23,182
什么？
Yeah, what?

1443
01:26:23,259 --> 01:26:25,420
我正要跟你说K
I was just about to tell you...

1444
01:26:27,496 --> 01:26:29,589
我爱他
that I love him.

1445
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:32,261
真的！
I do!

1446
01:26:32,335 --> 01:26:34,098
我爱他，我爱他！
I love him.

1447
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:35,728
我不在乎你怎么想
I love him, and I don't care what you think.

1448
01:26:35,805 --> 01:26:39,036
我爱他期许中的自已
I love him for the man he wants to be...

1449
01:26:39,108 --> 01:26:42,441
我爱他现在的样子
and I love him for the man that he almost is.

1450
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:44,648
我爱他，萝拉，我爱他！
I love him, Laurel.

1451
01:26:44,648 --> 01:26:47,483
我爱他K
I love him. I love him.

1452
01:26:47,483 --> 01:26:49,246
杰瑞，你好
Hi, Jerry.

1453
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:53,477
自然一点
Act natural.

1454
01:26:59,228 --> 01:27:00,695
告诉我他不在门口
Tell me he's not there.

1455
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,321
他不在门口
He's not there.

1456
01:27:02,698 --> 01:27:04,461
天啊！
Oh, God.

1457
01:27:04,934 --> 01:27:06,595
别激动K
- Easy, ladies, easy.

1458
01:27:07,169 --> 01:27:08,158
要咖啡吗？
- Coffee, Jerry?

1459
01:27:08,738 --> 01:27:12,435
不了，谢谢，我们吃麦片
No, thanks. We bottom feeders, we prefer cereal first.

1460
01:27:13,776 --> 01:27:15,710
吃苹果口味的
Let's have AppleJacks.

1461
01:27:15,778 --> 01:27:18,338
苹果口味？正是你要的
AppleJacks? AppleJacks it is.

1462
01:27:20,883 --> 01:27:22,510
亲爱的，早安
Good morning, darling.

1463
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:26,818
早安
Morning.

1464
01:27:27,289 --> 01:27:28,517
杰瑞，怎么了？
What's going on, Jerry?

1465
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:31,685
我们今天要接重要传真
A lot, actually. We've got a big fax today.

1466
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:33,852
我们需要这笔佣金
We need this commission.

1467
01:27:34,163 --> 01:27:36,324
需要这笔佣金，牛奶？
Need this commission. Milk?

1468
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:39,561
敬你
Cheers.

1469
01:27:47,376 --> 01:27:49,708
你今天早上表现得很好
That was really great of you this morning.

1470
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:56,442
努力才能从这屋里K
Look, let's just root for a big offer... so we can move out of this room...

1471
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:58,553
搬到真正的办公室
and into a real office.

1472
01:27:59,388 --> 01:28:00,480
请帮个忙
Would you mind?

1473
01:28:00,556 --> 01:28:01,989
多谢
Thanks a lot.

1474
01:28:06,162 --> 01:28:09,029
{\fn<font size=18 color=#4096d1>}“罗德：底薪35万元”

1475
01:28:10,266 --> 01:28:11,699
惨了！
Shit.

1476
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:15,238
你知道
You know, it's just...

1477
01:28:17,807 --> 01:28:20,503
三年也才170万元？
1.7 for three years?

1478
01:28:20,943 --> 01:28:22,376
我们不只这身价！
- Man, we owe more than that! - It's okay.

1479
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:25,380
这只是开价，我再去谈
This is how the game is played. Now I'm gonna go back to them.

1480
01:28:25,448 --> 01:28:28,383
谈什么？把你老二移开？
And say what? " Please remove your dick from my ass"?

1481
01:28:28,451 --> 01:28:29,110
玛西
- Marcee.

1482
01:28:29,185 --> 01:28:31,244
抱歉，怀孕心情不好
- I'm just a little pregnant right now.

1483
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,685
没关系
That's okay.

1484
01:28:32,755 --> 01:28:34,552
- 我很难过 - 我知道K
I feel like crying, Jerry. I feel like bustin' the room up.

1485
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:36,818
我想砸烂这屋子
Rod, let's not take this emotionally.

1486
01:28:36,892 --> 01:28:40,956
别激动，我们来想办法
We're gonna roll with this problem, okay?

1487
01:28:41,163 --> 01:28:42,687
你怎么这么冷静？
What are you so calm about?

1488
01:28:42,798 --> 01:28:46,598
什么意思：想办法、别激动？
What do you mean, "roll with this problem"? Don't take it emotionally?

1489
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:49,365
难道还没达到激动标准
You ask me, you haven't gotten emotional enough over this man!

1490
01:28:49,438 --> 01:28:50,666
我不同意
- I disagree.

1491
01:28:50,739 --> 01:28:52,604
巴布休葛曾跟我们联络
- Somebody get Bob Sugar on the phone.

1492
01:28:55,811 --> 01:28:56,709
你们要退出？
You wanna leave me?

1493
01:28:56,779 --> 01:29:00,943
人人有一套说词，你怎么说？
A lot of agents say a lot of shit. So what do you stand for?

1494
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,143
- 你们想退出？ - 你怎么说服我们！
- You wanna leave me? - What do you stand for?

1495
01:29:03,219 --> 01:29:05,414
诚实怎么样？
How about a little piece of integrity in this world...

1496
01:29:05,488 --> 01:29:10,257
贪婪、虚伪的世界真令人失望
so full of greed and lack of honor that I don't know what to tell my son...

1497
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:14,288
只有这个人不是想着怎么赚钱
except, " Here, have a look at a guy who isn't yelling, 'Show me the money!"'

1498
01:29:15,064 --> 01:29:16,622
知道他破产了吗？
You know he's broke?

1499
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:20,430
他破产了却免费为你们工作
He is broke and working for you for free.

1500
01:29:21,203 --> 01:29:23,899
破产了K
Broke.

1501
01:29:25,241 --> 01:29:27,971
抱歉，我没她那么会侮辱人
I'm sorry. I'm just not as good at the insults as she is.

1502
01:29:28,143 --> 01:29:29,940
不，达到目的了
No, that was pretty good.

1503
01:29:30,012 --> 01:29:31,001
真的
No shit.

1504
01:29:33,148 --> 01:29:35,378
我拿样东西给你们看
Let me show you something.

1505
01:29:39,121 --> 01:29:41,783
这个，罗德，你看看
Here.Rod, read this.

1506
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:43,050
不K
No

1507
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:48,692
杰瑞，这个很重要
I just think that... Jerry, I think it's important.

1508
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:50,732
我很感激，谢谢你
That came from your heart and you shouldn't deny it.

1509
01:29:50,799 --> 01:29:53,529
- 杰瑞 - 你该引以为荣
You should be proud of that, and I still think they should read it.

1510
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:54,466
杰瑞K
Jerry

1511
01:29:55,204 --> 01:29:56,967
告诉我该怎么做？
Tell me what to do.

1512
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:00,766
你要我怎么做我就怎么做
You tell me to eat lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

1513
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:04,611
真的只能得到这价码？
You tell me this is the best we can get, this is all we can get...

1514
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:05,942
就这个价码？
- All we can get?

1515
01:30:06,015 --> 01:30:08,381
- 玛西，我在跟经纪人讲话 - 不K
- Please, I'm talking with my agent.

1516
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:11,476
听我说，你该做的是K
Listen, this is what you're gonna do.

1517
01:30:11,554 --> 01:30:14,250
推掉那个烂合约
You're gonna reject that shitty contract...

1518
01:30:14,323 --> 01:30:17,053
履行完旧的烂合约
and play out your existing shitty contract

1519
01:30:17,126 --> 01:30:18,821
明年你就自由了
and be a free agent next year.

1520
01:30:18,894 --> 01:30:20,327
别这样！
Come on. Hey.

1521
01:30:20,396 --> 01:30:23,524
事关我俩，你和我
Baby, this is us. You and me.

1522
01:30:23,599 --> 01:30:25,464
我们来决定价码
We determine our worth.

1523
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:27,795
宝贝，你是强壮K
Baby, you are a strong,

1524
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:31,636
有尊严、打不倒的人
proud...surviving, splendid black man.

1525
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:39,215
说得对K
You are the shit.

1526
01:30:42,953 --> 01:30:45,012
哦，宝贝
Oh, baby.

1527
01:30:47,056 --> 01:30:49,490
若受伤就完了
If you get injured, you get zero.

1528
01:30:50,059 --> 01:30:52,254
不会，我意志坚强
- Won't happen. I'm strong in mind.

1529
01:30:52,328 --> 01:30:53,124
没错
- That's right.

1530
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:56,893
罗德，太冒险了
It's a risk.

1531
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,633
我们下相同的赌注
You bet on me like I bet on you.

1532
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:08,174
懂吗？
You know?

1533
01:31:08,243 --> 01:31:10,575
朋友，懂吗？
My man! You know?

1534
01:31:11,647 --> 01:31:15,816
宝贝，懂吗？
You know? You know? Baby?

1535
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:19,754
- 你真疯狂 - 我爱你
- Ah, you so crazy. - I love you, baby.

1536
01:31:21,924 --> 01:31:24,154
让我亲亲你
Let me kiss that head.

1537
01:31:33,769 --> 01:31:35,760
我去圣地牙哥工作
I'm gonna take that job in San Diego.

1538
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:38,236
- 先别提那些 - 你请不起我
- Don't even talk about that yet. - You can't afford me.

1539
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:41,232
- 我想办法K - 你付不起薪支
- I'll find something. - No, you can't afford me, Jerry.

1540
01:31:42,411 --> 01:31:44,003
我会去想办法
I'll find something fast for Tidwell.

1541
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:46,775
- 我不想榨干你 - 不会被榨干
- I refuse to be a drain. - We'll stay afloat.

1542
01:31:48,317 --> 01:31:50,308
我们会有办法
We will stay afloat.

1543
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:52,781
别走
Don't leave.

1544
01:31:52,855 --> 01:31:54,288
罗德，坐到骆驼上！
- Get on the camel! - You've been on my ass all day.

1545
01:31:54,356 --> 01:31:57,292
你整天都在支使我！ 我说不用坐骆驼
I told you to put the camera low, shoot me up from the bottom.

1546
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:59,021
- 站这里拍也一样 - 我知道K
- Make me look more powerful. - Get him on the camel!

1547
01:31:59,094 --> 01:32:01,363
- 叫他坐骆驼上！ - 我会的
- I'm gonna get him on the camel.

1548
01:32:01,363 --> 01:32:03,126
不需要骆驼，拍我就好了
- You don't need a camel. You have me!

1549
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:04,893
这车叫骆驼雪芙兰
- It's Kammell Chevrolet.

1550
01:32:04,967 --> 01:32:07,663
就是这种感觉！
- You see that? That's how I feel.

1551
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:09,761
他跟我一样痛苦！
Do you hear him? He's feeling my pain.

1552
01:32:09,838 --> 01:32:10,930
给我上去！
- Get on the camel!

1553
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:13,031
- 好了，不拍了 - 不拍了？
- Enough. I'm pulling him from this.

1554
01:32:13,108 --> 01:32:16,178
不K我只说不要骆驼
- Pulling him? - I'm not saying that. Get rid of the camel, and we can get busy with this.

1555
01:32:16,178 --> 01:32:19,113
运动员不需要拍这种广告
An athlete of your stature, this isn't what I had in mind.

1556
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:20,910
- 不拍？ - 对，我们走！
- You're pulling him? - You're right. Let's bounce.

1557
01:32:22,651 --> 01:32:26,143
当初为什么求我？
Pulling him? Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him!

1558
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,480
我知道你需要那笔佣金
I know you needed that commission...

1559
01:32:29,558 --> 01:32:35,564
但这种广告起不了作用
but we ain't gonna bring Reebok to their knees with no regional Kammell ad. Excuse me, darling.

1560
01:32:35,631 --> 01:32:38,327
可以问你一件私事吗？
Can I ask you a question that's totally unrelated to your career?

1561
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,425
我们是朋友了？
What, we gonna be friends now?

1562
01:32:41,036 --> 01:32:43,231
你觉得单亲妈妈怎么样？
What do you know about dating a single mother?

1563
01:32:43,706 --> 01:32:45,970
我就是单亲妈妈养大的
Plenty. I was raised by a single mother.

1564
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,369
告诉我K因为K
Tell me, because I think, after this...

1565
01:32:48,444 --> 01:32:51,038
她非去圣地牙哥工作了
she's gonna have to take that job in San Diego.

1566
01:32:51,747 --> 01:32:54,181
首先，单亲妈妈不约会
First of all, single mothers don't date.

1567
01:32:54,249 --> 01:32:55,910
小心
Watch it. Watch this thing.

1568
01:32:56,185 --> 01:33:01,186
不约会！她们都经历过
They don't date. They've been to the circus. You know what I mean?

1569
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:04,054
那一套她们心理有数了
They've been to the puppet show, and they've seen the strings.

1570
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:06,191
你爱她吗？
- Do you love her?

1571
01:33:06,462 --> 01:33:07,451
我怎么知道？
- How do I know?

1572
01:33:07,529 --> 01:33:09,793
什么？你当然知道
What do you mean, how do you know? You know when you know.

1573
01:33:10,165 --> 01:33:12,793
我觉得K不想让她走
I'm feeling a little... I don't want her to go.

1574
01:33:12,868 --> 01:33:13,960
我常常去她家
- I've been hanging out at her place.

1575
01:33:14,036 --> 01:33:17,334
够了，别说这些屁话
- Wait, wait, no. Right there, that's bullshit.

1576
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:19,304
你要好好待她
You gotta be fair to her.

1577
01:33:19,374 --> 01:33:22,172
单亲妈妈是很神圣的
A single mother, man, that's a sacred thing.

1578
01:33:22,344 --> 01:33:24,005
要好好跟她谈
You gotta have the talk.

1579
01:33:25,614 --> 01:33:27,172
她爱你
She loves you.

1580
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:30,046
你若不爱她必须告诉她
If you don't love her, you've got to tell her.

1581
01:33:33,522 --> 01:33:35,080
她儿子真可爱
The kid's amazing.

1582
01:33:36,024 --> 01:33:36,888
他K
He...

1583
01:33:39,561 --> 01:33:42,086
我了解
I feel you. I feel you, dog.

1584
01:33:42,531 --> 01:33:46,262
但是不该占单亲妈妈的便宜
But a real man would not shoplift the pootie from a single mother.

1585
01:33:48,203 --> 01:33:51,604
我没有占她的便宜
I didn't shoplift the pootie.

1586
01:33:56,612 --> 01:33:58,045
好吧
All right.

1587
01:33:58,881 --> 01:34:01,042
我占了她便宜
I shoplifted the pootie.

1588
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:15,128
科诠曾经跟麦尔说K
You know... John Coltrane once said to Miles Davis...

1589
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:17,555
道别时别太戏剧化
When you say good-bye to him, don't make a big, dramatic thing out of it.

1590
01:34:17,633 --> 01:34:20,500
冷静点，顺其发展
Just be cool. What's meant to be will be.

1591
01:34:20,936 --> 01:34:22,904
你们还会见面，我呢？
You'll still see each other. What about me?

1592
01:34:22,971 --> 01:34:25,064
我失去唯一听我话的
I'm losing the only person that listens to me,

1593
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:26,402
你只有部份听我的
and you only listen partially.

1594
01:34:26,475 --> 01:34:28,534
别逗我了，快说该怎么做
No, quit making me laugh. Come on.

1595
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:33,715
你做得很对K 你开始新生活，他去找暖被的
You're doing the right thing. You need to start your life. He needs a warm body to cushion the fall.

1596
01:34:33,715 --> 01:34:36,081
你看外面那两个男人
Check out exhibit "A" on the front lawn. Look at that.

1597
01:34:39,254 --> 01:34:41,222
他几乎激起我的同情心
I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.

1598
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:42,279
再见
- Good-bye.

1599
01:34:43,158 --> 01:34:44,819
真的再见
- Yeah, good-bye.

1600
01:34:47,763 --> 01:34:48,422
再见
Bye.

1601
01:34:56,205 --> 01:34:59,140
你会喜欢圣地牙哥的，雷
Listen, you're gonna like it in San Diego, Ray.

1602
01:35:04,046 --> 01:35:06,310
那里会很棒因为K
It's gonna be great there because...

1603
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:08,349
你会交很多朋友
you'll make a lot of friends.

1604
01:35:09,451 --> 01:35:11,715
周末我会去看你
I'm gonna see you this weekend, you know?

1605
01:35:11,787 --> 01:35:13,755
你走吧
Go ahead and go.

1606
01:35:19,328 --> 01:35:21,626
你走吧
Go ahead and go.

1607
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,576
你开这种车没问题？
Are you sure you're okay to drive this?

1608
01:35:34,643 --> 01:35:36,668
这种车？没问题
This rig? No problem.

1609
01:35:36,745 --> 01:35:38,337
周末见了
I'll see you this weekend.

1610

上车
Get in the car.

1611
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:42,174
桃乐丝，上车
Get in the car, Dorothy.

1612
01:35:42,251 --> 01:35:44,082
过几天就能再见面
I'll see you in a couple of days, yeah.

1613
01:35:44,152 --> 01:35:48,123
我爱你
I love you.

1614
01:35:48,123 --> 01:35:49,750
我也爱你
I love you too, you know?

1615
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:52,849
怎么了？
- What?

1616
01:35:52,928 --> 01:35:53,986
没什么
- Nothing.

1617
01:35:54,196 --> 01:35:55,857
- 再见了 - 好
- I'll see you soon. - Okay.

1618
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:58,860
如果K
Look...

1619
01:35:59,268 --> 01:36:02,066
若这周末变成下个月K
if this weekend should turn into next month...

1620
01:36:02,137 --> 01:36:04,833
下个月又不知拖到何时
and next month should turn into whatever...

1621
01:36:05,107 --> 01:36:06,870
别忘了自己的信念
don't make a joke of your life.

1622
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:10,901
看看你的文章，你比他们强
Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of'em.

1623
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:13,914
你比巴布休葛强
You're better than the Bob Sugars.

1624
01:36:15,284 --> 01:36:16,615
别忘了
Don't forget that.

1625
01:36:33,735 --> 01:36:35,635
等等！等一下！
Wait. Wait a second.

1626
01:36:35,704 --> 01:36:37,569
不K天啊！
No, no. Oh, God.

1627
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:42,401
我想到一个省钱的方法K
I know a way we can save on medical and rent.

1628
01:36:42,477 --> 01:36:44,308
别听他的
No, don't listen to him.

1629
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:46,176
若我们住在一起？
What if we stayed together?

1630
01:36:47,182 --> 01:36:48,240
若我们结婚？
What if we got married?

1631
01:36:49,284 --> 01:36:50,808
我求婚你会留下吗？
If I said that, would you stay?

1632
01:36:50,886 --> 01:36:53,115
不K别那么做
Don't do that.

1633
01:36:53,155 --> 01:36:55,020
别说，除非K
Don't say that unless...

1634
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:57,690
是真心话
Well, say it if you want to.

1635
01:37:03,598 --> 01:37:04,394
嫁给我好吗？
Will you marry me?

1636
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,768
你说怎么样？
What are you thinkin'?

1637
01:37:45,841 --> 01:37:47,468
萝拉
Laurel.

1638
01:37:48,143 --> 01:37:49,940
我们要结婚了
We're getting married.

1639
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:55,644
杰瑞马圭尔愿娶她为妻？
Do you, Jerry Maguire, take this woman... to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1640
01:37:56,752 --> 01:37:57,878
不，还没到
No, not yet.

1641

K嫁他为夫？
Take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?

1643
01:38:04,826 --> 01:38:05,815
快到了
Almost.

1644
01:38:05,894 --> 01:38:08,692
我宣布你们结为夫妻
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1645
01:38:08,764 --> 01:38:10,493
甜心，好了
- Okay, sweetheart. - Oh, yeah.

1646
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,438
妈妈K
Mother, mother

1647
01:38:22,044 --> 01:38:25,377
那么多妈妈在哭？
There's too many of you crying

1648

兄弟K
Brother, brother, brother

那么多兄弟死了
Far too many of you dying

1650
01:38:36,124 --> 01:38:39,525
我们必须想个办法
you know we've got to find a way

1651
01:38:40,929 --> 01:38:44,922
找一些爱回来
To bring some loving here today

1653

Picket lines, sister

1654
01:38:48,805 --> 01:38:50,966
我要走了
- And picket signs, sister - I should go.

1655
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:54,499
Don't punish me through brutality

1656
01:38:54,543 --> 01:38:57,205
老兄！来跟我说话
Come on, brother! Come on and talk to me, brother!

1657
01:38:58,014 --> 01:38:59,948
'Cause you can see

1658
01:39:00,016 --> 01:39:02,814
- Oh, what's going on - What's going on

1659
01:39:02,886 --> 01:39:05,184
- What's going on - What's going on

1660
01:39:11,426 --> 01:39:12,688
我们结婚了
We did it.

1661
01:39:14,763 --> 01:39:15,821
没错
We sure did.

1662
01:39:36,051 --> 01:39:38,076
搞砸了我会宰了你！
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

1663
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:47,286
很高兴跟你谈话
I'm glad we had this talk.

1664
01:39:49,631 --> 01:39:51,622
看他们
Oh, look at them.

1665
01:39:54,002 --> 01:39:55,993
她好漂亮啊
She is so beautiful.

1666
01:40:09,286 --> 01:40:13,086
你们会有很多孩子吗
Lfigure you two will have lots of kids.

1667
01:40:13,121 --> 01:40:16,386
没想到连这个也录了
I do not believe they have this on tape.

1668
01:40:17,627 --> 01:40:19,561
那是我兄弟
That's my bro.

1669
01:40:20,897 --> 01:40:22,831
Mother, mother

1670
01:40:23,298 --> 01:40:26,495
我要把这卷带子送去播
See, now, I'm gonna release this to ESPN.

1671
01:40:28,703 --> 01:40:32,174
- 你以为我开玩笑？ - 没关系
You think I'm joking. It's all right. I know where you live.

1672
01:40:32,174 --> 01:40:36,572
我知道你住哪里
Far too many of you crying

1673
01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:39,342
你没跟她谈，对吗？
You didn't have the talk, did you?

1674
01:40:42,651 --> 01:40:43,640
没有
To bring some loving No

1675
01:40:44,786 --> 01:40:47,983
这是另一个解决方法
Well, this definitely was another way to go.

1676
01:40:50,759 --> 01:40:53,159
桃乐丝，过来
Hey, Dorothy, come here.

1677
01:40:53,228 --> 01:40:56,629
各位，马圭尔夫妇
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Maguire!

1678
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:58,567
我们将有个好球季
We're gonna have a great season!

1679
01:40:58,567 --> 01:41:00,000
我们将有个好球季
We're gonna have a great season!

1680
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:11,504
史考特，看他的球技
Hey, Scotty. Tidwell, 4 for 36.

1681
01:41:14,616 --> 01:41:16,607
- 杰瑞 - 丹尼
Jerry  Dennis

1682
01:41:16,885 --> 01:41:18,614
罗德踢得不错
- He's having a good game...

1683
01:41:18,687 --> 01:41:19,449
到目前为止
- You bet he is. So far.

1684
01:41:19,521 --> 01:41:20,818
明年就签不到他了
- You're gonna miss him next year.

1685
01:41:21,356 --> 01:41:23,415
{\fn<font size=18 color=#4096d1>}失败者

1686
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:27,289
大家都很好让我很快能适应
Everyone's been kind to me, and I've been fortunate enough to slip right in.

1687
01:41:27,329 --> 01:41:29,524
我加入了很棒的球队
I've got a great team behind me, and I'm loving it. I'm loving life.

1688
01:41:29,598 --> 01:41:31,327
{\fn<font size=18 color=#4096d1>}我喜欢这球队与生活

1689
01:41:38,006 --> 01:41:39,837
我的鸟！
That's my mo-fo!

1690
01:41:41,343 --> 01:41:42,332
过来
Come here.

1691
01:41:44,112 --> 01:41:45,739
过来
Come here.

1692
01:41:45,814 --> 01:41:49,477
何不做家中不讲脏话的人？
Why don't you be the first man in your family not to use that word?

1693
01:41:49,551 --> 01:41:52,384
才有好日子过，快去吻爸爸
And then we'll let you live. Now go kiss Daddy, quick.

1694
01:41:56,558 --> 01:41:57,684
加油
Come on, now.

1695
01:41:58,526 --> 01:42:00,460
罗德，加油！
Come on, Rod!

1696
01:42:03,965 --> 01:42:06,866
你开场时表现不佳，为什么？
I saw you limping a little bit after the first quarter.

1697
01:42:06,935 --> 01:42:08,926
我掉了K
- What happened? - Yeah, I dropped my...

1698
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:13,072
让他们疲于奔命
I sprained my ankle on the ice out there. It was cold.

1699
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:14,937
让他们疲于奔命
It was kind of slick. Twisted my ankle.

1700
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:16,939
好，谢谢
All right. Thanks.

1701
01:42:17,245 --> 01:42:20,578
差不多了，还要访问谁吗？
That went well. Anybody else here worth talking to?

1702
01:42:21,349 --> 01:42:23,647
没有了，我们走
All right. Let's get out of here.

1703
01:42:25,387 --> 01:42:26,376
你还好吗？
- How's your head?

1704
01:42:26,454 --> 01:42:28,081
头好痛
- Bubblicious.

1705
01:42:28,156 --> 01:42:29,521
签个名好吗？
- Can you sign this?

1706
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:30,853
你好
- How are you?

1707
01:42:31,926 --> 01:42:33,188
你好吗？
- How are you doing, man?

1708
01:42:33,261 --> 01:42:34,523
还过得去
- Hanging in there.

1709
01:42:34,596 --> 01:42:36,154
打得很好
- Good game. - Tough one out there.

1710
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:40,457
四分卫烂透了
- Quarterback sucks, man. - Thanks, man.

1711
01:42:41,236 --> 01:42:42,999
差点害死我
Gonna get me killed.

1712
01:42:43,071 --> 01:42:45,471
球丢得又高又落中点
He was throwing high and across the middle.

1713
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:46,973
杰瑞，我很担心
I'm worried. I'm worried the only reason why...

1714
01:42:47,042 --> 01:42:49,169
我担心头摔坏，都怪你K
I'm getting my brains blown loose is 'cause you weren't asshole enough...

1715
01:42:49,244 --> 01:42:52,881
3个月前没帮我弄到千万合约
to get me my ten million three fucking months ago.

1716
01:42:53,248 --> 01:42:54,772
拜托
Shit.

1717
01:42:56,318 --> 01:42:58,946
球场上要小心点
You take care of yourself out on that field, you hear?

1718
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,851
你是我唯一的客户
- You're my entire client roster.

1719
01:43:00,922 --> 01:43:02,389
早知道了
- Don't I know this.

1720
01:43:03,224 --> 01:43:05,124
回去找你老婆
Now go home to your wife.

1721
01:43:05,493 --> 01:43:06,585
什么意思？
- What's that supposed to mean? - What are you doing here?

1722
01:43:06,661 --> 01:43:09,664
你来干嘛？电话联络就行了
You could've told me this shit over the phone.

1723
01:43:09,664 --> 01:43:13,327
可能我想尽心力？关心你？
How about dedication for an answer?

1724
01:43:13,401 --> 01:43:15,301
你不想回家，对吗？
How about personal attention?You don't want to go home, do you?

1725
01:43:15,704 --> 01:43:16,864
你说什么？
- What are you saying?

1726
01:43:16,938 --> 01:43:18,963
我只是想跟你谈谈
- I'm just trying to talk to you.

1727
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,598
你的婚姻如何？
How's your marriage?

1728
01:43:21,509 --> 01:43:24,103
夫妻间的感情好吗？
You know, the husband and wife thing? How is that?

1729
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,184
并非每个人都能像你一样
Not everyone has what you have.

1730
01:43:34,889 --> 01:43:36,720
你为什么结婚？
Then why did you get married?

1731
01:43:37,525 --> 01:43:39,516
以朋友的立场问
- I'm just asking as a friend.

1732
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:40,788
你想知道答案？
- You want an answer?

1733
01:43:41,696 --> 01:43:43,493
忠心
Loyalty.

1734
01:43:44,432 --> 01:43:46,059
她很忠心
She was loyal.

1735
01:43:50,538 --> 01:43:51,800
我是说K
I mean, you know, everything...

1736
01:43:51,873 --> 01:43:55,343
忠心最重要
grew from there.

1737
01:43:55,343 --> 01:43:57,243
凡事K
It just...

1738
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:00,041
以忠心为基础
grew from there.

1739
01:44:01,049 --> 01:44:03,142
那算答案？
That's an answer.

1740
01:44:03,685 --> 01:44:05,380
就是答案
That's the answer.

1741
01:44:05,687 --> 01:44:07,780
真不刺激
It's not sexy.

1742
01:44:08,823 --> 01:44:10,654
那就是答案
Shit. That's an answer.

1743
01:44:10,725 --> 01:44:12,420
告诉他赢得了什么
Tell him what he's won, Bob!

1744
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:15,054
美好的婚姻
A beautiful marriage!

1745
01:44:15,663 --> 01:44:17,460
天啊
Shit!

1746
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:21,997
很高兴能取悦你，一如往常
Well... I'm happy to entertain you, as always, Rod.

1747
01:44:24,005 --> 01:44:28,309
我想问你个问题
Shit. I have a question for you, Rod.

1748
01:44:28,309 --> 01:44:30,106
- 我们真的是朋友？ - 当然
- Are we really friends? - Why not?

1749
01:44:30,178 --> 01:44:33,238
因为朋友无话不说
Because friends can tell each other anything...

1750
01:44:33,314 --> 01:44:35,145
是吧
if we have our "friends hats" on, right?

1751
01:44:35,216 --> 01:44:36,547
好
- Yeah, I think so. - All right.

1752
01:44:36,618 --> 01:44:40,987
告诉你为何没签到一千万约
I'll tell you why you don't have your $10 million yet.

1753
01:44:41,623 --> 01:44:44,615
现在K你是个领薪的球员
Right now, you are a paycheck player.

1754
01:44:44,692 --> 01:44:46,819
你踢球用脑不用心
You play with your head, not your heart.

1755
01:44:46,895 --> 01:44:49,261
私人生活你用心
In your personal life, heart.

1756
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:52,788
上球场你只想到谁亏待你
But when you get on the field, it's all about what you didn't get...

1757
01:44:52,867 --> 01:44:55,563
该怪谁、谁没传好球K
who's to blame, who under-threw the pass...

1758
01:44:55,637 --> 01:44:58,663
谁的合约比你好、谁对不起你
who's got the contract you don't, who's not giving you your love.

1759
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:02,699
知道吗？那无法鼓舞人
You know what? That is not what inspires people.

1760
01:45:02,777 --> 01:45:04,506
无法激励人
That is not what inspires people.

1761
01:45:05,113 --> 01:45:09,311
闭上嘴，专心踢球
Just shut up. Play the game. Play it from your heart.

1762
01:45:09,384 --> 01:45:11,545
我会为你找到“宽”
And you know what? I will show you the kwan.

1763
01:45:11,619 --> 01:45:15,020
那就是实话，你受得了吗？
And that's the truth, man. That's the truth. Can you handle it?

1764
01:45:15,089 --> 01:45:17,250
由此可证我们是不是朋友
It's just a question between friends.

1765
01:45:17,325 --> 01:45:17,984
懂吗？
You know?

1766
01:45:21,229 --> 01:45:24,665
他们说你矮是我替你辩护
And when they call you shrimp, I'm the one who defends you!

1767
01:45:25,266 --> 01:45:26,824
不跟你做朋友了！
- I don't want to be friends no more.

1768
01:45:26,901 --> 01:45:27,697
随便
- Fine.

1769
01:45:27,769 --> 01:45:29,737
别用“宽”那个字
And quit using that word "kwan."

1770
01:45:29,804 --> 01:45:30,862
那是我的字
That's my word!

1771
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:32,599
洛杉矶见了
- I'll see you in L.A. - No heart.

1772
01:45:32,674 --> 01:45:35,405
不用心，不用心？
No heart?

1773
01:45:35,443 --> 01:45:37,434
我全心全力！浑蛋！
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

1774
01:46:15,884 --> 01:46:17,613
他脑震荡几次了？
How many concussions has he had?

1775
01:46:17,685 --> 01:46:20,813
一点都不尊重我，狗屎！
I don't get no respect. This is bullshit.

1776
01:46:20,889 --> 01:46:23,050
我创造奇迹
You know what I'm saying? I'm making miracles happen.

1777
01:46:41,075 --> 01:46:45,739
我那天去看所谓的黑人电影
You guys, I go to see this so-called black film the other day.

1778
01:46:45,914 --> 01:46:48,178
别加那么多盐
Honey, no more salt for you.

1779
01:46:48,249 --> 01:46:53,021
大赛快到了，我不想见你脱水
The biggest game of the season's coming up. I don't want you dehydrated for Monday Night Football.

1780
01:46:54,556 --> 01:46:58,652
总之，二十分钟的预告片
Anyway, 20 minutes of coming attractions.

1781
01:46:58,726 --> 01:47:00,853
都是黑人主演，都是暴力片
All black films, all violent.

1782
01:47:00,929 --> 01:47:03,227
黑人枪杀黑人
I'm talking about brothers shooting brothers.

1783
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,789
看电影怎么不找我？
I hate you going to the movies alone without me.

1784
01:47:05,867 --> 01:47:07,767
宝贝
Oh, baby.

1785
01:47:08,403 --> 01:47:10,667
双鱼座皇后
- My Pisces queen. - Oh, baby.

1786
01:47:13,308 --> 01:47:15,799
我讨厌自己去看电影
I hate seeing movies without you.

1787
01:47:18,613 --> 01:47:21,241
不会再这样了，好吗？
I won't do it anymore, okay?

1788
01:47:21,316 --> 01:47:22,874
好
I promise.Ok

1789
01:47:26,254 --> 01:47:27,243
再亲一个
Another one.

1790
01:47:28,556 --> 01:47:29,454
宝贝
Chi-Chi-Bear.

1791
01:47:30,692 --> 01:47:32,717
宝贝
- Baby. - Baby.

1792
01:47:32,794 --> 01:47:35,524
宝宝
- Oh, baby. Baby.

1793
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:36,389
宝宝！
- Oh, baby. Oh! Baby!

1794
01:47:36,464 --> 01:47:37,328
现在？
- Now? - Oh, baby, baby now! Baby now!

1795
01:47:37,398 --> 01:47:42,362
宝宝，快走 雷，该走了
- Baby? - Ray, it's time to go!

1796
01:47:42,804 --> 01:47:43,930
宝宝，来吧
- Baby. Come on.

1797
01:47:44,038 --> 01:47:44,834
孩子带来了？
- You got them?

1798
01:47:44,906 --> 01:47:46,931
收信用卡吗？
Hey, you take Visa? Take it!

1799
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:51,237
你觉得怎么样？
What were you thinking tonight...

1800
01:47:51,312 --> 01:47:56,848
目睹他们经历温馨的过程
watching them go through... the entire human emotional experience?

1801
01:47:56,851 --> 01:47:59,615
我希望他上场别受伤
I was thinking, "I hope he doesn't get injured."

1802
01:48:01,823 --> 01:48:03,814
我觉得有责任
I felt responsible.

1803
01:48:05,426 --> 01:48:10,193
有时真搞不懂你在想什么
Sometimes I can't tell at all what's going on in that head of yours.

1804
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:18,495
也不懂你发这声音的意思
And I really don't know your noises yet.

1805
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:22,766
若不懂，你可以问我
Well, when you wonder, ask me.

1806
01:48:22,844 --> 01:48:24,812
好，我会的
Okay, I will.

1807
01:48:27,015 --> 01:48:29,142
我刚才不是问了？
I thought I just did.

1808
01:48:34,422 --> 01:48:36,947
- 你为什么爱我？ - 你为什么爱我？
- Why do you love me? - Why do you love me?

1809
01:48:38,593 --> 01:48:40,527
我能进来看电视吗？
Can I come in and watch TV?

1810
01:48:40,595 --> 01:48:42,563
- 等一下 - 只能看一下
- In a minute. - Just for a few minutes.

1811
01:49:03,051 --> 01:49:05,042
忍耐，他就是这样子
Hang in there. He's not going anywhere.

1812
01:49:05,453 --> 01:49:07,512
我知道
I know.

1813
01:49:07,588 --> 01:49:10,352
我们能谈些别的吗？
Could we talk about something else?

1814
01:49:10,425 --> 01:49:14,054
不行，我不喜欢闲言闲语
I don't think so. I'm incapable of small talk.

1815
01:49:14,128 --> 01:49:16,426
你喜欢我这点，对吗？
But that's why you love me, right?

1816
01:49:29,877 --> 01:49:32,437
我致上关怀问候
I want you to know I'm about personal attention.

1817
01:49:32,513 --> 01:49:36,643
工作是我生命，24小时候教
This is my life. I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

1818
01:49:36,718 --> 01:49:38,447
我在办公室可随时联络
I'm in my office. Call me anytime.

1819
01:49:38,519 --> 01:49:40,851
我明天去凤凰城 为了周一夜足球赛
I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow for Monday Night Football.

1820
01:49:40,922 --> 01:49:44,483
我会去印第安纳州，周二上午
I can be in Indiana by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

1821
01:49:44,559 --> 01:49:46,322
只要20分钟
Just give me 20 minutes.

1822
01:49:47,028 --> 01:49:49,087
不需要立即答覆
I'm not asking for an answer now.

1823
01:49:49,163 --> 01:49:51,393
明天再给我回话
Why don't you... I'll call you tomorrow.

1824
01:49:51,466 --> 01:49:54,663
祝愉快并代向道格问好
Just enjoy the rest of your day. Tell Douglas I said hello, would you?

1825
01:49:55,069 --> 01:49:56,661
好，谢谢
All right. Thank you.

1826
01:49:56,738 --> 01:49:58,467
也祝你，梅瑞丽，再见
Same to you, Marilee. Bye-bye.

1827
01:50:01,609 --> 01:50:03,270
印第安纳州，星期二
Indiana, Tuesday.

1828
01:50:03,745 --> 01:50:05,337
我会去的
I'll be there.

1829
01:50:09,484 --> 01:50:10,974
都是我的错
It's my fault.

1830
01:50:13,454 --> 01:50:14,216
怎么了？
What?

1831
01:50:14,722 --> 01:50:16,656
对你不公平
It's not fair to you,

1832
01:50:16,724 --> 01:50:18,021
这整件事情
this whole thing.

1833
01:50:21,529 --> 01:50:22,894
过来
Here.

1834
01:50:24,098 --> 01:50:27,033
说给我听，让我帮你
Tell me. Let me help.

1835
01:50:27,535 --> 01:50:29,366
我占你的便宜
I took advantage of you.

1836
01:50:29,437 --> 01:50:33,305
更糟糕的是我跟儿子联手
The worst of it is that I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.

1837
01:50:34,408 --> 01:50:38,037
我只是K太感情用事
I was just on some wild ride...

1838
01:50:38,112 --> 01:50:44,177
以为我是因为爱而做选择
where I thought that I was in love enough... for both of us.

1839
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:48,487
我假装你是为了爱而求婚
I pretended that proposal by the car was real...

1840
01:50:48,556 --> 01:50:50,820
我太不切实际了
and it might've just been a hypothetical.

1841
01:50:54,462 --> 01:50:56,362
都是我造成的
I did this...

1842
01:50:56,798 --> 01:50:59,961
我想做一些补救
and at least I can do something about it now.

1843
01:51:00,935 --> 01:51:03,836
我不会逃避责任
I'm not a guy who runs.

1844
01:51:03,905 --> 01:51:05,668
我维持现况
I stick.

1845
01:51:07,775 --> 01:51:10,243
我不要你守着不放
Well, I don't need you to stick.

1846
01:51:11,579 --> 01:51:12,978
- 你想怎么做？ - 我不知道
- What do you want? - I don't know.

1847
01:51:13,047 --> 01:51:14,878
你想要我的灵魂？
- My soul or something?

1848
01:51:14,949 --> 01:51:17,281
又如何？我应得的
- Why not? I deserve that.

1849
01:51:18,953 --> 01:51:20,921
若我生性如此呢？
What if I'm not built that way?

1850
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:24,023
这桩婚姻是场错误
- I think we made a mistake.

1851
01:51:24,091 --> 01:51:27,026
不，若我真的是K
- No, listen. What if it's true?

1852
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:31,993
适合当朋友，不适合做丈夫
Great at friendship, bad at intimacy.

1853
01:51:32,066 --> 01:51:36,594
那是我K单身汉派对的主题
I mean, come on, it's the theme of my bachelor film, for God's sake.

1854
01:51:36,671 --> 01:51:39,105
我知道，我看到了
I know. I watched it.

1855
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,701
记得很清楚
I sort of know it by heart.

1856
01:51:44,879 --> 01:51:46,938
我不想放弃
I don't like to give up.

1857
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:49,508
拜托K杰瑞
Please, Jerry.

1858
01:51:49,984 --> 01:51:54,717
我想补救而你也有责任
My need to make the best of things and your need to be responsible.

1859
01:51:55,289 --> 01:51:57,621
若现在不说，十年后K
If one of us doesn't say something about it now...

1860
01:51:57,692 --> 01:52:01,423
我们将相敬如“冰”
we could lose ten years being polite.

1861
01:52:04,165 --> 01:52:08,602
将这个阶段当作是K
Let's just call this next road trip what it really is...

1862
01:52:10,037 --> 01:52:11,629
喘息的空间
a nice, long break.

1863
01:52:20,748 --> 01:52:21,976
雷怎么办？
What about Ray?

1864
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,447
你们会是朋友
Well, you'll be friends.

1865
01:52:30,024 --> 01:52:31,514
朋友？
- Friends?

1866
01:52:31,592 --> 01:52:33,116
对，朋友
- Friends.

1867
01:52:36,297 --> 01:52:38,288
当然是朋友
Of course you'll be friends.

1868
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:40,926
我会带他去动物园
I'll take him to the zoo.

1869
01:52:44,939 --> 01:52:47,703
所谓喘息就是分手
So this break is a breakup.

1870
01:52:48,276 --> 01:52:49,766
别这样
Come on, Jerry.

1871
01:52:49,844 --> 01:52:52,404
你知道我不好受
You know this isn't easy for me.

1872
01:52:53,581 --> 01:52:56,414
表面上一切无恙
On the surface everything looks fine.

1873
01:52:57,418 --> 01:52:59,648
我嫁给这么棒的人
I've got this great guy...

1874
01:53:01,289 --> 01:53:04,156
他爱我的孩子
and he loves my kid...

1875
01:53:06,594 --> 01:53:09,324
他也挺喜欢我
and he sure does like me a lot.

1876
01:53:15,903 --> 01:53:18,667
我无法这样下去
And I can't live like that.

1877
01:53:21,809 --> 01:53:24,573
我无法忍受
It's not how I'm built.

1878
01:53:57,011 --> 01:53:59,741
若这里是空的K
If this is empty...

1879
01:53:59,814 --> 01:54:01,748
这里也无所谓了
this doesn't matter.

1880
01:54:24,071 --> 01:54:25,868
只是一篇工作感言
It was just a mission statement.

1881
01:54:42,523 --> 01:54:44,514
把手伸开
Put your arms out. Let's see.

1882
01:54:44,592 --> 01:54:46,617
看看是什么
All right. Let's see what you've got here.

1883
01:54:58,906 --> 01:55:01,170
罗德，好久不见
Hey, Rod, buddy, dude.

1884
01:55:01,242 --> 01:55:03,005
我到处找你，你好吗？
I was wondering where you were. How's it going?

1885
01:55:03,077 --> 01:55:05,910
走开
Get out of here. Go.

1886
01:55:07,681 --> 01:55:09,148
你的经纪人呢？
- Where's your agent?

1887
01:55:09,216 --> 01:55:10,979
我不知道
- I don't know.

1888
01:55:11,685 --> 01:55:15,382
你该加入更好的队
I know this is uncool to do this now, but you belong with the big boys.

1889
01:55:15,456 --> 01:55:17,287
赚更多的钱
You belong with the big money. You're fucking Rod Tidwell.

1890
01:55:17,358 --> 01:55:20,561
滚开！离我客户远一点
Get away from my guy.

1891
01:55:20,561 --> 01:55:21,892
杰瑞，正谈到你K
- Hey, Jerry, I was just hailing you.

1892
01:55:21,962 --> 01:55:23,395
走开，滚！
- Just go. Flee.

1893
01:55:25,633 --> 01:55:27,567
难得的美好时光
This is a nice moment for you.

1894
01:55:28,035 --> 01:55:29,935
让你开心片刻吧
I'm gonna let you have it.

1895
01:55:32,039 --> 01:55:34,473
跟我联络，代我向玛西问好
Give me a call, Rod. Say hi to Marcee for me.

1896
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:45,050
谢谢你赶来
- Thanks for coming.

1897
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:45,778
我想念你
- I missed you.

1898
01:55:48,189 --> 01:55:50,157
怎么办呢？
What can I say?

1899
01:55:50,224 --> 01:55:52,283
你是我唯一的客户
You're all I've got.

1900
01:55:54,428 --> 01:55:55,725
欢迎再度观赏K
Hello again, everyone. Frank Gifford with Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf.

1901
01:55:55,796 --> 01:56:00,096
在亚历桑那州转播的这场球赛
Welcome to Tempe, Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium...

1902
01:56:00,167 --> 01:56:04,696
今晚亚历桑那队表现十分出色
where the story tonight is the Arizona Cardinals. They are still alive for a play-off spot.

1903
01:56:04,705 --> 01:56:07,037
最主要的原因就是K
The reason the Cardinals are alive is the outstanding play...

1904
01:56:07,108 --> 01:56:10,043
表现杰出得惊人的罗德廷威
the surprising play of Rod Tidwell.

1905
01:56:10,111 --> 01:56:11,874
我爸爸！
- We'll talk about that too. - That's my daddy!

1906
01:56:11,946 --> 01:56:14,073
德州队依旧保持领先
Meanwhile, the Dallas Cowboys continue to roll.

1907
01:56:14,148 --> 01:56:18,013
这场赛决定晋级超级杯的球队
They know they're in the play-offs... and going in looking for a second consecutive Super Bowl.

1908
01:56:18,052 --> 01:56:20,111
依目前情况看K
Who could've believed this? Here's the deal.

1909
01:56:20,187 --> 01:56:22,655
若亚历桑那队连赢了这两场球
If Arizona wins tonight and next week...

1910
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:27,890
将打破21年从未晋级的纪录
amazingly the Cardinals will make the play-offs... for the first time in 21 years.

1911
01:56:29,296 --> 01:56:32,697
最好别在这一刻搞砸了
Better not mess up for Monday Night Football.

1912
01:56:33,167 --> 01:56:34,600
我没说错吧？
What'd I say?

1913
01:56:34,668 --> 01:56:37,501
大家都知道转播赛令他紧张
Everybody knows he gets nervous for nationally televised games.

1914
01:56:37,571 --> 01:56:42,537
稍后继续德州队超级杯之路
The Cowboys continue their Super Bowl mission on Monday Night Football... a Christmas edition.

1915
01:56:49,850 --> 01:56:50,748
雪娜
- Hey, Shannon.

1916
01:56:50,818 --> 01:56:52,342
杰瑞，他很出色
- Hi, Jerry. Good game.

1917
01:56:52,419 --> 01:56:54,148
你的专栏很棒
Yeah. Hey, great column this morning.

1918
01:56:54,221 --> 01:56:54,880
谢谢
Thanks.

1919
01:57:01,061 --> 01:57:02,460
去你的
Fuck you, punk!

1920
01:57:09,603 --> 01:57:12,128
两队都非常蛮暴
Boy, guys, it's a real bruiser out there tonight.

1921
01:57:12,206 --> 01:57:16,609
亚历桑那队一点都不示弱
Frank, the Cardinals just refuse to go quietly into the desert night...

1922
01:57:16,677 --> 01:57:18,975
表现势在必得的企图心
as their seemingly interminable season winds down.

1923
01:57:19,046 --> 01:57:21,412
我只想说些优美词句
Come on, guys. I'm trying to be a little poetic here.

1924
01:57:21,482 --> 01:57:23,313
很好，再修饰啊！
Wax on, Al. Wax on.

1925
01:57:25,853 --> 01:57:28,048
罗德廷威被撞了一记
Oh, a tough hit on Rod Tidwell.

1926
01:57:28,122 --> 01:57:29,589
这可用不上优美词句
Nothing poetic about that.

1927
01:57:29,657 --> 01:57:32,091
是我早触地得分了
I would've taken it for the touchdown all the way, baby.

1928
01:57:32,493 --> 01:57:34,324
他今晚接的第六球
That's his sixth catch of the night. Split to the right.

1929
01:57:34,395 --> 01:57:37,464
往右场跑，接住球了！
Swenson looks that way, hits him...

1930
01:57:37,464 --> 01:57:39,364
成功的将球推进19码处
and it's enough for a first down at the 19-yard line.

1931
01:57:39,433 --> 01:57:43,369
又一记猛烈撞击罗德廷威
Another savage hit across the middle on Rod Tidwell.

1932
01:57:44,038 --> 01:57:45,130
他还真耐撞
He took some shot, didn't he?

1933
01:57:45,806 --> 01:57:48,604
德州队全力封锁罗德廷威
They are working Tidwell, aren't they?

1934
01:57:48,676 --> 01:57:50,507
爸爸怎么说的？
- Hey, what does Daddy always say? - Nice job by Swenson.

1935
01:57:50,578 --> 01:57:52,739
事情没有想像中糟
- "It looks worse than it really is."

1936
01:57:52,813 --> 01:57:54,246
对
- That's right.

1937
01:57:54,315 --> 01:57:56,943
伤成这样休想再踢球了
He ain't gonna have nothing left for next season. He'll kill himself!

1938
01:57:57,017 --> 01:57:58,314
安静
- Can you be quiet?

1939
01:57:58,385 --> 01:57:59,113
我没说错吧？
- What'd I say?

1940
01:57:59,186 --> 01:58:00,676
离终场还剩两分钟
Less than two minutes to play.

1941
01:58:00,754 --> 01:58:02,745
德州队领先3分
Dallas leading by three.

1942
01:58:02,823 --> 01:58:07,283
德州队11码处准备进攻
Second down and one now at the Dallas 11-yard line.

1943
01:58:07,595 --> 01:58:09,932
后传球，遭夹击！被撞倒地
- Hut! - Swenson back to pass.

1944
01:58:09,932 --> 01:58:13,629
他失了六码球
A blitz! And down he goes! He's sacked for a six-yard loss.

1945
01:58:14,068 --> 01:58:16,400
很好的攻势策略
Good move coming with the blitz, getting after Swenson.

1946
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:17,835
史汪森跛着脚走
Swenson's limping back. He had too many men in that pattern.

1947
01:58:17,905 --> 01:58:22,642
队员分散没人支援四分卫
They just did not have enough to pick up the blitz.

1948
01:58:22,676 --> 01:58:24,166
闭嘴，听好！
- Listen up. Listen up. - Shut up!

1949
01:58:24,478 --> 01:58:27,675
90剃刀喊1即攻，预备？
Ninety razor, X out, on one. Ready?

1950
01:58:27,748 --> 01:58:28,806
加油！
Break!

1951
01:58:28,882 --> 01:58:31,043
上场了，加油K
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1952
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:34,212
刚才球能快点传出就好了
He had a chance to get rid of it, but he had to tuck it away.

1953
01:58:34,288 --> 01:58:37,780
从2区前1码退到后7码
From second and one, they've now gone to third and seven.

1954
01:58:37,858 --> 01:58:39,723
在输赢的关键时刻
In the waning moments of this game,

1955
01:58:39,793 --> 01:58:41,930
德州17分亚历桑那14分
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.

1956
01:58:43,364 --> 01:58:45,355
廷威左右游移
- Tidwell in motion... - Come on, Cards!

1957
01:58:45,432 --> 01:58:48,367
移回左场，做假动作
Moving back to his left now.

1958
01:58:48,435 --> 01:58:51,666
史汪森守住球，将球传出
Play fake. Swenson protected well, lofts one to the end zone!

1959
01:58:51,739 --> 01:58:54,503
廷威接住，触地得分！
- Yes! - Touchdown Cardinals!

1960
01:58:54,575 --> 01:58:56,975
精彩！你看他接球的样子？
What a great effort! Did you see him go up on that ball?

1961
01:58:57,044 --> 01:59:00,013
整个人抱住球，他还躺在地上
He held on to the football. He's still down on the ground.

1962
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:03,607
罗德廷威倒栽葱摔得很重
But Rod Tidwell, upside-down, hits the ground hard...

1963
01:59:03,684 --> 01:59:05,743
仍紧抓着球不放
and manages to maintain control of the football.

1964
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:08,549
他受伤了，没错
Oh, yeah, he's hurt too. Oh, yeah.

1965
01:59:08,722 --> 01:59:10,519
他还没站起来
He's not getting up.

1966
01:59:10,591 --> 01:59:13,822
看队员脸上惊愕的表情
Boy, look at the faces of these Cardinal players now...

1967
01:59:13,894 --> 01:59:15,764
- 为受伤队员担忧 - 宝贝，快起来
- as elation turns into concern... - Oh, my God. Get up, baby.

1968
01:59:15,764 --> 01:59:19,131
教练赶到场中查看K
- For their fallen teammate. - Cardinal trainer goes to the field...

1969
01:59:19,166 --> 01:59:21,498
罗德廷威接住了九球
- as Tidwell makes his ninth catch... - Oh, my God.

1970
01:59:21,568 --> 01:59:23,729
亚历桑那队目前领先
And gives Arizona the lead.

1971
01:59:31,912 --> 01:59:33,345
听得见吗？
Can you hear me? Blink, baby.

1972
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:36,309
眨眨眼K
Come on, blink!

1973
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:37,446
罗德
Rod

1974
01:59:42,458 --> 01:59:47,394
为什么播广告？罗德怎么了？
- We'll come back to... - Why are they going to a commercial? Tell me what's wrong with my husband.

1975
01:59:47,428 --> 01:59:49,828
我就说罗德不会成功
See, I told you he was too small for the NFL.

1976
01:59:49,897 --> 01:59:50,761
闭嘴！
- Shut up! - I just got a commitment to the truth.

1977
01:59:50,831 --> 01:59:54,001
我说实话！没有批评他
I'm not putting him down. I'm keeping it real.

1978
01:59:54,001 --> 01:59:55,764
提比，闭嘴！
Tee Pee, shut up!

1979
01:59:55,836 --> 01:59:58,430
不能对你哥哥忠心一点？
Can't you be loyal to your brother that loves you?

1980
01:59:58,505 --> 02:00:01,303
你给我滚出去！滚出去！
Get the hell outta my house. Get out of my house!

1981
02:00:01,942 --> 02:00:03,068
喂？
- Get out of my house, Tee Pee! - Hello?

1982
02:00:03,143 --> 02:00:04,075
稍候
Hold on.

1983
02:00:04,144 --> 02:00:05,406
是杰瑞马圭尔
It's Jerry Maguire.

1984
02:00:06,246 --> 02:00:07,736
浑球！
Punk!

1985
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:10,939
杰瑞
Jerry

1986
02:00:11,018 --> 02:00:13,350
天啊！我快吓死了
Oh, my God, Jerry, I am freaking out.

1987
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,388
玛西，他失去知觉
Marcee, he's unconscious.

1988
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,258
我知道，保持冷静
No, I know. Just stay calm. Keep the phone lines open.

1989
02:00:18,325 --> 02:00:20,828
保持电话畅通，我再通知你
I will call you back.

1990
02:00:20,828 --> 02:00:23,564
现场有很好的医生，冷静点
There's good doctors on the field. Just stay calm.

1991
02:00:23,564 --> 02:00:25,555
不K你得告诉我
No, you have to tell me something.

1992
02:00:25,632 --> 02:00:27,998
我没办法冷静，我吓坏了
I cannot stay calm. I am freaking here.

1993
02:00:28,068 --> 02:00:31,799
你必需冷静，家人需要你冷静
Please. You gotta stay calm. Your family needs you to stay calm.

1994
02:00:31,872 --> 02:00:33,999
我知道K
I know. I know.

1995
02:00:34,074 --> 02:00:37,407
但他是我的一切K
But my whole life is this family...

1996
02:00:37,478 --> 02:00:39,948
我不能没有他
and it does not work without him!

1997
02:00:39,948 --> 02:00:42,912
由另个角度再看一次
And right now, as we look at it from another angle...

1998
02:00:42,983 --> 02:00:44,746
这是球赛现场实况转播
all eyes here at Sun Devil Stadium...

1999
02:00:44,818 --> 02:00:49,983
杰瑞，抱歉曾经对你的指控
Jerry, I am so sorry. Everything that I said about your job.

2000
02:00:50,057 --> 02:00:53,720
请尽力帮罗德，求求你
Just do whatever you can to get Rod to me, please.

2001
02:00:53,794 --> 02:00:56,058
尽力救他
Just do whatever you can.

2002
02:00:56,497 --> 02:00:58,124
杰瑞，求求你
Please, Jerry.

2003
02:00:58,799 --> 02:01:03,670
这一刻希望他家人没在看电视
I'll tell you, at a time like this... you just hope that his family is not watching this.

2004
02:01:04,505 --> 02:01:07,702
检查一下，可能是颈或背受伤
Check his neck. It could be his neck. It could be his back.

2005
02:01:11,912 --> 02:01:13,345
眨眨眼K
Blink, baby!

2006
02:01:13,414 --> 02:01:14,847
快啊！醒来
Come on, wake up!

2007
02:01:17,017 --> 02:01:19,110
罗德，我们爱你
We love you, Rod!

2008
02:01:27,828 --> 02:01:31,497
罗德K你听得见吗？
Rod, can you hear me?

2009
02:01:31,632 --> 02:01:33,293
听得见吗？
Can you hear me?

2010
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,534
你知道身在何处？
Do you know where you are, Rod?

2011
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:39,405
教练仍试图唤醒他
You can see the trainer still trying to revive Rod Tidwell.

2012
02:01:39,473 --> 02:01:40,872
希望能让他苏醒
You'd love to see some movement.

2013
02:01:42,609 --> 02:01:44,668
把他带离球场
Let's get him off the field. Get the gurney.

2014
02:01:45,446 --> 02:01:48,813
- 不K - 拿担架来抬，快！
Get the gurney. Let's get him off the field now.

2015
02:01:48,882 --> 02:01:50,372
不K等一下
No, wait, wait, wait.

2016
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:53,652
让我享受这片刻
Just let me enjoy this for a minute.

2017
02:01:53,787 --> 02:01:57,086
期盼罗德廷威苏醒的人K
You're looking for any type of movement out of Rod Tidwell.

2018
02:01:57,157 --> 02:01:58,317
他的头抬起来了
- Is that his head coming up I see?

2019
02:01:58,392 --> 02:02:00,417
他正试着站起来
- He's gonna try to get up.

2020
02:02:02,663 --> 02:02:04,324
他站起来了！
And he is getting up!

2021
02:02:12,773 --> 02:02:16,004
天啊！他没事
Oh, my God! Look at him. Mommy, he's okay!

2022
02:02:18,046 --> 02:02:19,536
天啊！
Oh, my God!

2023
02:02:20,147 --> 02:02:22,877
看台上的观众都起立欢呼
- Help me. - Everybody's standing in the stadium.

2024
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:24,577
他站起来了！
He's up on his feet, and the crowd loves it.

2025
02:02:54,047 --> 02:02:59,986
媒体不看好的冷门球员大翻身
Here's a guy who most of the season has been very truculent with the media... has been standoffish.

2026
02:03:14,768 --> 02:03:17,134
罗德，我们为你高兴
Rod, we're happy for you, buddy.

2027
02:03:17,204 --> 02:03:20,264
他会因此罚球但谁在乎！
He's gonna get a flag on this, but who cares?

2028
02:03:20,674 --> 02:03:22,574
{\fn<font size=18 color=#4096d1>}“罗德赚大钱”

我们怎么没这种关系？
Why don't we have that kind of relationship?

2046
02:04:54,635 --> 02:04:56,569
是你的还是我的？
Is that your porty or mine?

是玛西
It's Marcee.

2051

你的电话打不通
She couldn't get through on your phone.

2052

No, I'm okay. You know there ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

2060
02:05:52,025 --> 02:05:53,151
我想问题是K
I think the problem is...

2061
02:05:53,226 --> 02:05:56,593
艾丽丝，你曾说过生物节奏
Alice, you were saying earlier, something about the biorhythms or...

2062
02:05:57,798 --> 02:06:01,165
我是说神经管路有特定模式
I was saying that the neural pathways are set...

2063
02:06:01,234 --> 02:06:06,203
所以个性、行为很难改变
and that's why it's hard for people to change. That's why behavior doesn't change very often.

2064
02:06:07,974 --> 02:06:09,635
怎么了？
- Rochelle, what's wrong? - I'm sorry.

2065
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:14,541
抱歉，圣诞让我感到更孤单
These stupid holidays are making me feel more divorced.

2066
02:06:14,581 --> 02:06:16,515
能体会吗？
- You know? - Absolutely.

2067
02:06:16,583 --> 02:06:19,677
圣诞乐声不断、巧克力吃不停
I mean, with the songs and the constant chocolate-eating...

2068
02:06:35,569 --> 02:06:37,730
我想向大家告解
You know what? I have a confession to make.

2069
02:06:39,005 --> 02:06:42,668
我听你们说了无数伤心的故事
I've listened to you all tell a thousand sob stories...

2070
02:06:42,743 --> 02:06:46,645
我常常不以为然
and, well, I've been very judgmental.

2071
02:06:46,713 --> 02:06:48,442
也许你们说得没错
Maybe you're all correct.

2072
02:06:48,515 --> 02:06:51,279
男人是敌人
Men are the enemy.

2073
02:06:51,351 --> 02:06:53,216
不，男人不是敌人
- Thank you. - No, they're not the enemy.

2074
02:06:53,286 --> 02:06:55,083
但是K
But

2075
02:06:55,155 --> 02:06:58,022
我还是爱敌人
I still love the enemy.

2076
02:07:12,272 --> 02:07:14,035
哈
Hello. Hello.

2077

我在找我太太
I'm looking for my wife.

2078

Okey

2080
02:07:42,402 --> 02:07:46,634

If this is where it has to happen, then this is where it has to happen.

2081
02:07:48,074 --> 02:07:51,043
我不让你甩掉我
I'm not letting you get rid of me.

2082
02:07:51,111 --> 02:07:52,169
你说怎么样？
How about that?

2083
02:07:58,351 --> 02:08:01,323
我最擅长说服别人K
This used to be my specialty. I was good in the living room.

2084
02:08:01,323 --> 02:08:04,724
单枪匹马
They'd send me in there, I'd do it alone.

2085
02:08:05,158 --> 02:08:06,989
现在我却K
And now, I just...

2086
02:08:13,433 --> 02:08:14,957
不知道
And now

2087
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,137
但今晚K
But tonight...

2088

我们的小公司有很大收获

非常K大的收获

2090
02:08:35,956 --> 02:08:38,049
但是不完美K
But it wasn't complete.

2091
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:46,766
根本算不上接近完美
It wasn't nearly close... to being in the same vicinity as complete...

2092
02:08:46,766 --> 02:08:48,791
因为我不能与你分享
because I couldn't share it with you.

2093
02:08:50,837 --> 02:08:52,964
我听不到你的声音
I couldn't hear your voice...

2094
02:08:55,041 --> 02:08:57,509
或与你一起欢笑

2095
02:09:00,046 --> 02:09:01,570
我想念K

我想念我太太
I miss my wife.

2097
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:21,692
我们活在愤世嫉俗的世界
We live in a cynical world...

2098
02:09:21,768 --> 02:09:24,601
愤世嫉俗
a cynical world...

2099
02:09:25,338 --> 02:09:29,536
生意的竞争对手都很强悍
and we work in a business of tough competitors.

2100
02:09:39,853 --> 02:09:41,844
我爱你
I love you.

2101

别说了
Just shut up.

你一进门就征服了我
