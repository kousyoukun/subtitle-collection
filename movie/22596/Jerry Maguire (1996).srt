1
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,309
The world. Six billion people...

2
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,598
When I was a kid, there were three.
It's hard to keep up.

3
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:56,205
That's better.
That's America.

4
00:00:56,366 --> 00:01:00,750
America still sets
the tone for the world.

5
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,358
In Indiana, Clark Hodd.
The country's best point-guard.

6
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:09,743
Last week he scored 100 points
in a single game.

7
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:14,317
Erica Sorgi.
You'll see her ln the next Olympics.

8
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:20,845
In Seattle. Dallas Malloy, 16.
One of the premier women boxers.

9
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:24,238
She's thinking about her boyfriend
right now.

10
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:30,413
Indio, California. Art Stallings.
Check out what pure joy looks like.

11
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:34,415
Odessa, Texas.
The great Frank Cushman.

12
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:40,079
Next April, 26 teams will be falling
over themeselves to sign him.

13
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,894
He's my most important client.

14
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:45,486
Start trying!

15
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,638
There's genius everywhere.
Some make it...

16
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,182
- You don't know diddley about golf!
- ...some don't.

17
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:59,534
I'm the guy you don't usually see.

18
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:02,959
I'm behlnd the scenes.
I'm the sports agent.

19
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,862
- I'm gonna hurt you this year.
- Hi, Jerry.

20
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:11,983
My door's always open if you want
to come and get a real agent.

21
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:16,239
I'm going to a meeting right now
to talk about you.

22
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:21,391
- We've got to win Super Bowls.
- Jerry, how are you doing?

23
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:26,319
- Who much is this gonna cost me?
- I know what you can afford.

24
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:29,519
I'll write it down for you.

25
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:33,648
- I can't afford that.
- Winning isn't cheap.

26
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:39,855
The new player and owner photo.
That's me on the left.

27
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:45,040
This is where I work. SMI.
Sports Management International.

28
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:54,064
33 agents guiding the careers
of 1,685 finely-tuned athletes.

29
00:02:55,504 --> 00:03:01,391
I handle the lives of 72 clients
and get 264 phone calls a day.

30
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:06,640
I will not rest until you're holding
a coke in your own commercial, -

31
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:11,855
- broadcast during a Super Bowl
game that you're winning.

32
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,256
It's what I do best.

33
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,225
I started noticing
a few years ago...

34
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:23,537
In the quest for the big dollar,
little things were golng wrong.

35
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:29,297
There's no proof of anything.
This guy is a sensational athlete.

36
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:34,128
Are you Calvin Nack?
Can you sign my card?

37
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,297
I'm sorry, little fella, I can't.

38
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:42,736
- Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
- I just wanted an autograph.

39
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:45,873
Lately, it's gotten worse.

40
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,872
Hi, baby.

41
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,424
Do you know your name?

42
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:06,609
Wait, it's coming...
My name is Steve Remo.

43
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,793
I play for Chicago.
This lady here is my wife.

44
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,753
This is my boy. And this is...

45
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:22,674
Wait... My agent!

46
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:28,049
I've got to play this weekend, Doc.
I've got to play 65% of my games.

47
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,153
I've got to get the bonus.

48
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:35,569
- Okay, Jesse, take care.
- Mr. Maguire...

49
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,081
This is his fourth concussion.
Shouldn't he stop?

50
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:43,761
It would take a tank
to stop your dad.

51
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:50,514
It would take all five
Super Trooper Warriors.

52
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,819
Right?

53
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:55,857
Right?

54
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:59,313
Fuck you!

55
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:06,290
Who had I become?
Just another shark in a suit?

56
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:27,284
Salaries are skyrocketing, and you
are one of the guys responsible.

57
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:36,691
Two days later, at our conference
in Miami, a breakthrough.

58
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:40,146
Breakdown?
Breakthrough.

59
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,763
- I just wanted an autograph.
- Fuck you.

60
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:49,139
I couldn't escape
one simple thought.

61
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,363
I hated myself.

62
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:59,442
No, here's what it was...
I hated my place in the world.

63
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:09,491
I had so much to say,
and no one to listen.

64
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,171
And then it happened...

65
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:19,475
It was the oddest,
most unexpected thing...

66
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:24,244
I began writing
what they call a mission statement.

67
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:28,787
A suggestion
for the future of our company.

68
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:35,156
A night like this doesn't come along
very often. I seized it.

69
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:39,059
What started out as one page,
became 25.

70
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,292
I was my father's son again.

71
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:46,516
Remembering the simple pleasures
of this job.

72
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,900
The way a stadium sounds
when a player performs well.

73
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,348
The way we're supposed
to help them in health and injury.

74
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,604
With so many clients,
we had forgotten what was important.

75
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:04,629
I wrote and wrote ...
and I'm not even a writer.

76
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:09,556
I was remembering my mentor
Dicky Fox, who said:

77
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:13,493
The key to this business
is personal relationships.

78
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:18,932
Suddenly, it was all clear.
The answer was fewer clients.

79
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:24,341
Less money. Caring for them
and caring for ourselves.

80
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:27,604
Just starting our lives... really!

81
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:32,564
I'll be the first to admit,
what I was writing was touchy-feely.

82
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:38,740
I didn't care. It was the me
I'd always wanted to be.

83
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:45,845
I went out and
printed up 110 copies.

84
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,525
Even the cover looked like
the "Catcher in the Rye".

85
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:54,293
I entitled it, "The Things
We Think and Do Not Say".

86
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,077
"The Future of Our Business"

87
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:03,125
That's how you become great, man.
Hang your balls out there.

88
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:06,197
Thanks.

89
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,621
Everybody got a copy.

90
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,942
Some of the animals out there
walk on two feet.

91
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,870
Society needs protection
from these warped minds.

92
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:34,805
Boom!

93
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,918
This is Jerry Maguire.
Those manuscripts...

94
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:47,030
Oh, they did?
No, that's fine, thank you.

95
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:17,207
Finally, somebody said it.

96
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,783
Good work, Maguire.

97
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:42,679
I was 35, and I'd started my life.

98
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:47,799
- How long do you give him?
- About a week.

99
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:59,799
- Are you with the sports people?
- Jerry Maguire, SMI.

100
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:03,864
Bobbi Fallon, BPI.
I'm producing the Coke commercials.

101
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:05,976
Good luck.

102
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:12,119
My son is really allergic
to the blanket material...

103
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,416
That's all we have, okay?

104
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:23,800
- I'm sorry if I was rude just now.
- That's okay. We're both in it now.

105
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:30,519
Why is it so easy to talk to you?
Tell me about your fiancée.

106
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:35,608
Honey, are you all right?
Do you want some juice?

107
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,953
Thank you.
We're out hiking.

108
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:46,519
I've got the ring in my pocket.
I'm a little nervous.

109
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:50,968
She says to me... Get this:
"Hurry up, klutz."

110
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:55,865
It bothered me somewhat.
I got quiet. Then she got quiet.

111
00:10:56,025 --> 00:11:02,137
I decide not to propose.
The mood isn't right.

112
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:07,224
But I know that she knows
that I was going to propose.

113
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:11,160
- So we check back into the hotel.
- How sad.

114
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:16,057
Little do I know, but my assistant
presumes I've now proposed.

115
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:21,880
She's got the lounge band to play
"Here Comes The Bride".

116
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:27,065
There's football players watching
and an ESPN crew.

117
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:30,584
So I turn to her and grandly say:

118
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:37,050
"Goddess of Rock Climbing,
would you marry a klutz?"

119
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:40,921
I took out the ring.
I don't much like big scenes, -

120
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:45,753
- but she said "yes"
right there ln the lobby.

121
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,857
The toughest men in football wept.

122
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,865
- We're getting married in February.
- You'll stay married forever.

123
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,841
- What's wrong, Mom?
- First Class is what's wrong.

124
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:11,674
It used to be a better meal,
now it's a better life.

125
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:19,034
Ray?

126
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:23,802
Ray! Come on, buddy.

127
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:29,018
- Ray!
- Excuse me, can I help you?

128
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:32,218
Jerry Maguire.

129
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:38,106
- I work in your office.
- You're Dorothy Boyd in accounts.

130
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,227
By your desk is a photo of Einstein
with Shaquille O'Neal's body.

131
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:48,987
- That's pretty good.
- What did you lose here?

132
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:52,570
My son... My mind.
Ray!

133
00:12:55,867 --> 00:13:02,554
Dorothy, while I go look for him,
you grab this gentleman here.

134
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,474
You scared me!

135
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,931
- Don't do that again, ever!
- Okay, Mommy.

136
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:19,227
Ever, ever... ever!

137
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:24,892
- Dorothy... take care.
- Thank you so much.

138
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:29,786
I loved your memo, by the way.

139
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,595
- You did?
- Yeah.

140
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:40,955
Thanks. Actually,
it was just a mission statement.

141
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:46,555
In this age, optimism like that
is a revolutionary act.

142
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:51,419
I appreciate that.
I didn't know if I should write it.

143
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,804
It was two in the morning,
and some of the stuff I just...

144
00:13:55,996 --> 00:14:00,636
That part about
"embracing with enthusiasm...

145
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:07,676
...and forcing commerce to give
a little back for the greater good."

146
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,724
I was inspired,
and I'm an accountant.

147
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,660
I mean, to respect yourself enough
to say it out loud.

148
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,787
To put yourself out there like that,
so nakedly.

149
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:26,908
I don't know... It got me.

150
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:35,932
- Is this bothering you?
- No, this is... great.

151
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:38,653
It's great.

152
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:42,941
Do you need a ride?
Do you need a lift?

153
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:48,284
Oh, no! I'm sure
that would just make your day.

154
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:52,764
Driving us out to Manhattan Beach.
All those tiny streets.

155
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:57,725
Playing chicken with the traffic.
Your life flashing before you.

156
00:14:57,885 --> 00:15:02,621
- I've had too much coffee.
- It's no problem.

157
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,548
There's my sister Laurel,
to pick us up.

158
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:15,005
Ray... Dorothy... a pleasure.

159
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,693
Bye.

160
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,637
Hi, Ray. Hi, you.
I'm double parked, let's go.

161
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,710
Is this everything?

162
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:39,453
Whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

163
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:39,869
Whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

164
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:46,589
Don't ever stop fucking me!

165
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,909
Sooner or later
we'll have to stop!

166
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,526
Never been better...
Never!

167
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,893
Never better!

168
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:07,486
Open your eyes. If you want it,
I'd go with another woman for you.

169
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:11,326
I'm not interested in it, anymore.

170
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:14,718
It was a phase. A college thing.

171
00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:18,111
Like torn Levis
or law school for you.

172
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,270
Want some fruit from the kitchen?

173
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:33,022
- Do you have to tell me everything?
- That's what intimacy is.

174
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:39,486
- We're eating out tomorrow night.
- I know about the bachelor party.

175
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:45,438
Your buddies worked hard for this.
The guys from the office are coming.

176
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:51,359
Relax, act surprised,
and have an amazing time.

177
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,127
Hey, old college-buddy.
Congratulations.

178
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,167
- For you.
- Thank you.

179
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:24,831
And this. The finest cigar
my club has to offer.

180
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,847
This is what it's all about, man.
Everybody loves you.

181
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:34,175
It pisses me off!

182
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:38,176
Whether you're country,
a red-neck or a freak...

183
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:42,271
Young or old,
from Moscow, London or Memphis...

184
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:47,200
Jerry Maguire will still be
the king of rock and roll.

185
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:52,672
- Your little black book.
- He makes my heart pound.

186
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:56,735
- I know Jerry pretty well.
- Hi, Jerry, remember me?

187
00:17:56,928 --> 00:18:00,832
- I'll see you for lunch tomorrow.
- He was good in bed.

188
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:04,224
This is the funniest thing ever.

189
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:08,608
Jerry should get married.
He won't be alone.

190
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:12,480
- He cannot be alone.
- He can't be alone.

191
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,503
Jerry is great at friendship,
but he's really bad at intimacy.

192
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,224
He can't be alone.

193
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:25,376
- He can't say, "I love you".
- He's an agent. He lies.

194
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:31,616
- I love you too.
- Hey, love you too.

195
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:34,015
I love you.

196
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:40,224
- I love you.
- I love you.

197
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:56,032
- Good morning, Jenny.
- Sorry I missed the party.

198
00:18:56,226 --> 00:19:01,121
Good morning, Jerry.
Marcee's here and she's in a hurry.

199
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:06,689
I'm glad to see you finally made it.
Rod is very upset.

200
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:09,281
- Tyson, no!
- Okay.

201
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:12,545
- Hello.
- Long time no see!

202
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:16,225
- Tyson!
- How can I make your life better?

203
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:21,249
Jerry, I don't want any bullshit.
Where is our offer from Arizona?

204
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,305
- Cronin's for lunch?
- This is Bob Sugar.

205
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:31,169
- He's called at our house.
- Sorry to interrupt you.

206
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:36,098
You've got to earn your 4%.
My husband has an image.

207
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,930
Putting him in a water-bed
commercial makes him common.

208
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:45,794
He deserves the big four: Shoe,
car, clothing line, soft drink.

209
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:49,602
I know about celebrity endorsement.

210
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:53,922
We both majored in marketing.
We came to play!

211
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:57,217
The dirtyman is back!

212
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,690
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

213
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:08,610
Are you okay?

214
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,985
- Fine. What's up?
- I came here to let you go.

215
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:19,202
- Pardon me?
- I came here to fire you, Jerry.

216
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:26,818
It's real. You should say something.

217
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:35,778
Shit.

218
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:41,667
A crowded restaurant...
so there won't be a scene.

219
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,219
You ungrateful...

220
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:57,795
You did this to yourself.
You said fewer clients.

221
00:20:57,988 --> 00:21:01,282
How do you think it feels
firing you?

222
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:06,595
I've thought about it all week.
Get past yourself for a second!

223
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:09,731
- You'll lose.
- You wanted smaller.

224
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:14,659
Well, now I want all my clients,
and yours, too.

225
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:35,044
Wendy, bring me my numbers.

226
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,972
- Cush.
- This is Sugar.

227
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:57,284
Look, you're the most important guy
in sports. How does it feel?

228
00:21:57,412 --> 00:22:01,348
I just want to play football.
Dad, it's one of the agents.

229
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:07,269
Wendy! Keep trying Cushman.
And please, bring me my numbers.

230
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,237
J.J., what's up?
Have you talked to Maguire?

231
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:15,780
He had a meltdown.
I've talked to Doritos about you.

232
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:19,685
They're very interested.
Here, talk to Rick.

233
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:26,020
Carlo, you pay 25% of your
endorsements to SMI. I'll take 18%.

234
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:29,956
I don't know if it was drugs,
but the guy freaked out.

235
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,861
He's not the guy for you.
How's your mom?

236
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,030
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

237
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:43,396
What does your heart tell you?
I'm sorry to hear that.

238
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:53,029
- What's going on?
- They've fired Jerry Maguire.

239
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:04,100
That's a mistake.

240
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:08,230
I'm concerned about your family
and your future.

241
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:11,589
I go back a long way with SMI.

242
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:14,469
Is Maguire black?

243
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,301
Bob Sugar?
He's... entertaining, funny...

244
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:22,725
I'm Mr. Black People!

245
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:26,150
Don't make this harder than it is.

246
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:30,278
I've got to be honest,
this is very distressing for me.

247
00:23:30,438 --> 00:23:35,430
Remember that stripper
at Laguna Beach? Her name was April.

248
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,974
I remember things.
It's not the money. I do it for you.

249
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:44,390
- I'm still holding for Katarina.
- I'm talking big money.

250
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:46,950
Great!

251
00:23:47,078 --> 00:23:51,302
Are you in or out?
This is business not friendship.

252
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,950
You are in... that's good.

253
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:58,375
I want to cry
for what they did to you.

254
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:03,655
If it wasn't for the Acura deal,
you know I'd go with you.

255
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:09,095
Jerry. Oh, God!

256
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:13,831
Call waiting.
Who could be calling me now?

257
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:17,767
- Hi, Kathy Sanders.
- Still me, Kathy.

258
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:25,222
Kathy, why are you crying?
Oh... so you're in.

259
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,391
Rod, it's Jerry Maguire.

260
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:31,623
Jerry Maguire! How am I doing?

261
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:35,943
I'll tell you. I'm sweating.
Where's my contract?

262
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:39,783
Bob Sugar says
I'm missing out being with you.

263
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:43,975
- You hear what I'm saying?
- That's why I called.

264
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:48,230
No, no... Do you truly
hear what I'm saying?

265
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:52,775
- I hear you, Dad.
- We have to get together.

266
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:57,607
- Hold on a minute, Rod.
- Personal attention.

267
00:24:57,768 --> 00:25:03,880
- That's what you told my wife.
- That's what I said.

268
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,903
Good! We're just getting started
on the things you need to know.

269
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:11,784
I will kill for you.

270
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:17,416
I am a valuable commodity. There's
dudes out there trying to kill me.

271
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:23,207
I still catch the ball. Touchdown!
I make miracles happen.

272
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,384
Are you in?

273
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:28,904
I'm from Arizona.
I broke Arizona records.

274
00:25:29,064 --> 00:25:32,263
I went to Arizona State!

275
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:36,041
- And now you want Arizona dollars.
- Exactly.

276
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,647
I'm sitting here
with an ant problem.

277
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:46,216
My brother Tee Pee's room
is flooded.

278
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:49,544
- Say hello to Jerry Maguire.
- Hello.

279
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:52,616
Hello, Tee Pee.

280
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:59,752
No one's looking out for me.
I'm supposed to be a superstar.

281
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:06,024
- Are you in or out?
- You stay with Bob Sugar!

282
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:10,569
I am a role model.
I have a family to support!

283
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,672
I want a contract in Arizona.

284
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,520
I like you.

285
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:20,680
My wife likes you.
You're good to my wife.

286
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:23,977
- I will stay with you.
- That's great.

287
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:28,552
That's what I'm gonna do for you.
God bless you, Jerry.

288
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:32,457
This is what you're gonna do for me.

289
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:36,297
What can I do for you?
You just tell me.

290
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:41,897
It's personal and very important.
Hell! It's a family motto.

291
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,673
- Are you ready, Jerry?
- I'm ready.

292
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:48,776
Here it is.

293
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:52,521
Show me the money.

294
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:54,697
Show...

295
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:58,473
...me ...the...

296
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,097
...money... !

297
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:07,177
- Say it with me, Jerry.
- Show you the money.

298
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:10,441
No, you can do better than that.

299
00:27:10,602 --> 00:27:14,570
- Bob Sugar's on the other line.
- Show you the money.

300
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,962
- No, show me the money.
- Show me the money.

301
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:21,194
- Louder!
- Show me the money.

302
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:26,794
- You've got to yell that shit!
- Show me the money!

303
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:30,601
- Louder, Jerry.
- Show me the moneyl

304
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:34,347
Show me the money!

305
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:39,434
- You love this black man.
- I love the black man!

306
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:44,395
- I love black people.
- I love black people.

307
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:49,706
Show me the money!

308
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:53,706
Congratulations,
you're still my agent.

309
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:27,722
Well... don't worry.

310
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:32,683
I'm not gonna do
what you think I'm gonna do.

311
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,235
Let me just say...

312
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:45,067
...as I ease out of the office
I helped build...

313
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:51,819
I'm sorry, but it's a fact that
there's such a thing... as manners.

314
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:56,747
A way of treating people.

315
00:28:58,284 --> 00:29:03,148
These fish have manners.

316
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,548
In fact, I'm starting a new company
and the fish will come with me.

317
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:15,275
Call me sentimental,
but the fish are coming with me.

318
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:28,556
Okay.

319
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:34,125
If anybody else
wants to come with me, -

320
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:40,332
- this is a chance for something
real, and fun, and inspiring -

321
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:46,124
- in this godforsaken business,
and we will do it together.

322
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:53,356
Who's coming with me?

323
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:56,780
Who's coming with me?

324
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:02,637
Who's coming with me
besides Flipper here?

325
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:12,716
This is embarrassing.

326
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:21,165
All right.
Wendy, shall we?

327
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:25,741
I'm three months away
from the pay increase...

328
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,022
Okay.

329
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:47,374
- I will go with you.
- Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

330
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:58,189
Right now?

331
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:03,087
Don't do it.

332
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:09,646
Bye.

333
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:21,069
We'll see you all again.
Sleep tight.

334
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,606
Let's see how they do without us.

335
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:41,038
Thank you.

336
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:46,191
- You will have a medical program?
- Oh, sure.

337
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,702
I don't know...

338
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:55,917
Don't panic.
We're gonna be okay.

339
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:01,327
We're gonna be great.
We're gonna be... great.

340
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:37,198
- I wonder what he said.
- My aunt is hearing impaired.

341
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,031
He just said,
"You complete me".

342
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,024
To support one another,
we've got to listen to one another.

343
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:12,624
Women are taught not to see
each other as good people.

344
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:16,977
We see each other as enemies.
We compete over men.

345
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:21,936
- It's true, It's terrible.
- I used to hate women.

346
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:26,129
Now I've met you guys,
and you're like me.

347
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:30,065
It's important
because you can be my friends.

348
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:33,520
- What about medical?
- Of course.

349
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,687
Single parents can't be frivolous.

350
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:41,328
If you had read what he wrote,
you'd have left, too.

351
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:47,409
Do you know those child exams
cost $150, and that's if he's well.

352
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:51,216
- Where is Ray?
- Asleep in the living room.

353
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:57,841
Don't leave my little boy alone
with your divorced women's group.

354
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:02,353
I've finally got in touch
with my anger.

355
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,841
What did I do?

356
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:17,969
Function, function...
Forward motion is everything.

357
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,593
Cush saves all.

358
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:24,785
Go to Texas. Keep one star,
and they'll all follow.

359
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:29,873
There's no real loyalty.
You told me that yourself.

360
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:33,842
- I was trying to sleep with you.
- Well, it worked.

361
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:39,634
I will not let you fail.
You are Jerry Maguire!

362
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:43,633
King of the house calls.
Master of the living room.

363
00:34:43,794 --> 00:34:48,434
- Okay, this is working.
- You are not a loser.

364
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:56,818
- Who mentioned losing?
- Wrong word! When can you leave?

365
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:27,986
- Matt?
- I'm in the back, Jerry.

366
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:31,186
Would you like a bloody beer?

367
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:35,539
- Beer and tomato juice.
- I'm fine.

368
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:40,883
We've spent a lot of time together,
and you know I care about your son.

369
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:44,883
I'm concerned
that if you stay with SMI...

370
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:48,786
We've decided to stay with you.

371
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:59,378
I'm not really a hugger.
I can't let go.

372
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:04,915
I told myself if he shows up,
we stick with him.

373
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:09,299
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Cush.

374
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:13,939
- How are you?
- You remember Keith.

375
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:18,612
He must go number one in the draft,
and I want him to play.

376
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:22,195
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.

377
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:28,179
- I'll either surf or ski.
- Denver's where he should be.

378
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:34,611
You know I don't do contracts,
but what you do have ls my word.

379
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:38,867
And it's stronger than oak.

380
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,821
- Hello.
- Jerry Maguire.

381
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:33,525
- Is Avery there?
- She has an NFL meeting in Atlanta.

382
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:42,581
- Hello?
- My son's here with the nanny.

383
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:47,348
- In our office?
- Nanny? I prefer child technician.

384
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:54,708
- I came home to work here.
- Fine. Dorothy, we are backl

385
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:00,276
We are so very, very back.
I resigned Cush. We're set.

386
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:04,981
- I am so happy for you.
- Happy for us.

387
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:07,157
Happy for us.

388
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:14,165
Rod, being at the draft will help.
Get on the plane and meet us there.

389
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:17,205
Good. See you there.

390
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:20,822
Avery will be at the B-gate at 4:15.

391
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:25,493
Do you know the human head
weighs eight pounds?

392
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:31,445
Troy Aikman, in only six years,
has passed for 16,303 yards.

393
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:39,062
- Bees and dogs can smell fear.
- I've booked Tidwell at the Mariot.

394
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:44,790
Pete Rose made 4,256 hits and
he's not in the Hall of Fame.

395
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,038
Did you know that my neighbour
has three rabbits?

396
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,814
I can't compete with that.

397
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:56,950
- Did we go over everything?
- Yep.

398
00:38:57,111 --> 00:39:01,206
- Back on Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

399
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:06,870
- Ray, wish me luck.
- Good luck!

400
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:29,846
- Hey, Rod, you made it.
- Jerry...

401
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:36,727
- Hi, Cush.
- We should be selling these.

402
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:41,879
This is my agent, you might
want to get his autograph.

403
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:46,199
- Excuse me...
- Are you Hootie?

404
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:51,543
No, I'm not Hootie.

405
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:59,000
Is it gonna be San Diego or Denver?

406
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:08,343
He'll either surf or ski.

407
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:17,944
Rod, at last I find you.

408
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:22,007
What am I doing here, Jerry?
This ain't my party.

409
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:27,222
- Nobody gives a damn about me.
- Let's walk through the lobby.

410
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:32,599
I want the media and the reps
to see you for what you are:

411
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:36,856
The best-kept secret in the NFL.

412
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:41,688
You are the wide - receiver.
You're fast, fierce and charismatic.

413
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:44,568
You are the man! Ready?

414
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,447
Let's go. The fiercest.
You are the man.

415
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:56,152
- Let's do it.
- Hi, Mel. Hi, Tom.

416
00:40:56,313 --> 00:41:01,400
It's a good thing you were able
to hold onto Cushman.

417
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:06,872
I want you to meet Rod Tidwell,
110 catches, 1,550 yards last year.

418
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:43,673
I came all that way
just to walk the lobby.

419
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:49,273
- It might have even worked, too.
- Yeah? Let's do it again.

420
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:55,737
See the Reebok-ad down there.
Where are my endorsements?

421
00:41:55,897 --> 00:42:00,248
No love from Chevy,
no love from Pepsi...

422
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:03,994
I ain't gettin' no love from Nike.

423
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:08,281
Did I ever tell you
about my Reebok story?

424
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:13,434
- I've got to get back to Cushman.
- Oh, your golden paycheck.

425
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:17,977
I'll boil it down for you.
Fuck Reebok!

426
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:22,905
All they do is ignore me.
Always have.

427
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:30,105
For a moment down there,
you got that chip off your shoulder.

428
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:35,450
You let people in.
You were brilliant.

429
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:39,130
- Really?
- Brilliant.

430
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:43,163
- See you tomorrow.
- You're loving me now.

431
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:46,202
I'm showing you the money!

432
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:53,019
I was just testing you, but to hear
you say that makes me love you.

433
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:57,370
Jerry, come back.

434
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,538
- How was your flight?
- Good.

435
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:07,419
If you can find your size, grab
some of those shoes by the door.

436
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:17,690
Cush, Matt,
we have a decision to make.

437
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:22,906
San Diego just came in with
a last-minute scenario. It's big.

438
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:28,602
- He's got to go number one.
- San Diego wants him bad.

439
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:33,819
- What happened to Denver?
- Before a draft, people get crazy.

440
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:40,091
San Diego is offering seven years
for 30. Signing bonus of 8.

441
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:44,027
- Should I unplug the phone?
- Damn reporters.

442
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,388
You just say, "No comment".

443
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:51,195
I'm no good at
talking and saying nothing.

444
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:54,107
Let me.

445
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:59,164
For you, it's a pleasure.
This is Cush.

446
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:04,156
It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?
Sniff if he is.

447
00:44:04,315 --> 00:44:11,707
You're in with the big boys now.
I got you the deal you needed.

448
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:17,884
This is business, not friendship.
You've got to be strong.

449
00:44:18,044 --> 00:44:21,852
Okay, buddy? See you later.

450
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:29,275
No comment.

451
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,084
- He's got it all wrong.
- You're on TV again.

452
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,932
I'm sick of me.

453
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,028
Before I go back to Denver,
let's put something down on paper.

454
00:44:56,252 --> 00:45:02,332
- A contract with Jerry Maguire.
- Not right now, Jerry.

455
00:45:06,973 --> 00:45:11,740
Do I know everything
there is to know here, Matt?

456
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:16,893
You're not talklng with Bob Sugar?

457
00:45:17,085 --> 00:45:24,636
- Denver would only deal with him.
- Said who? Sugar?

458
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:31,357
- I'm learning as I go here.
- You let him deal behind my back?

459
00:45:31,517 --> 00:45:37,277
I'm sorry... I love my son.

460
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:43,742
I love your son!
I brought Denver to 20 million.

461
00:45:43,901 --> 00:45:48,605
You listened to Bob Sugar?
That is a child.

462
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:53,054
You let that snake in the door?

463
00:45:53,822 --> 00:46:00,445
Okay, listen, rookie mistake.
I'll fix this Denver thing for you.

464
00:46:00,606 --> 00:46:05,182
You didn't sign anything
with Sugar, right?

465
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:09,918
Matt...?
Tell me you didn't sign.

466
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:16,669
What happened to your "my word
is stronger than oak" thing?

467
00:46:19,038 --> 00:46:22,590
We signed an hour ago.

468
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:26,430
You were in the lobby
with the black fella.

469
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:33,438
Sorry, Jerry.
I just want to play football.

470
00:46:35,486 --> 00:46:40,062
- How do I spin this?
- Honey, it's spun!

471
00:46:40,223 --> 00:46:44,446
- What did I do to you?
- It's all about you, isn't it?

472
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:49,950
"Soothe me, save me, love me."
I have to finish my job.

473
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:55,359
- Everything is on the run with us.
- We are salespeople. We sell.

474
00:46:55,551 --> 00:47:02,367
It's not trust my handshake,
it's make the sale! Get it signed.

475
00:47:02,526 --> 00:47:07,614
- Welcome to my nightmare.
- Is honesty outlawed here?

476
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:14,750
- I would prefer loyalty.
- Our deal was the brutal truth.

477
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:18,175
I think you added the "brutal".

478
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:23,390
There is a sensitivity thing that
some people have. I don't have it.

479
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:29,118
I don't cry at movies,
or gush over babies.

480
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,040
And I don't tell a man who just
screwed up, "Oh, poor baby."

481
00:47:35,808 --> 00:47:39,744
But I do love you.

482
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:46,240
- Avery, it's over.
- I didn't hear it.

483
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:50,432
- There's something missing.
- You've never been alone.

484
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:53,759
- You can't be alone.
- It's over.

485
00:47:57,151 --> 00:48:03,296
- No one has ever dumped me.
- I'm not trying to make history.

486
00:48:03,455 --> 00:48:10,976
I climbed El Capitan in 18 hours and
23 minutes. I can make this work.

487
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:17,759
No.

488
00:48:17,984 --> 00:48:20,511
Oh, Jerry . ..

489
00:48:27,712 --> 00:48:31,584
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

490
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:45,759
I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
I'm too strong for you. Loser!

491
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:53,120
Roll with the punches .
Tomorrow's another day.

492
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:59,553
- Taxi !
- You're loving me now, aren't you?

493
00:48:59,745 --> 00:49:02,271
Very much. Taxi!

494
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:05,728
Didn't we arrive in a limo?

495
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:11,169
I hope I don't sound too much
like a shrink here, but...

496
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:16,673
- What's wrong?
- I'm just a big disappointment.

497
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:20,896
Everybody cries on this show.

498
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:24,642
If you've tested positive,
quit doing blow.

499
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:29,921
Upset about your baby girl.
Why did you leave her mother?

500
00:49:30,113 --> 00:49:34,881
The media don't understand the
pressures $54 million comes with.

501
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:40,001
- This is some bullshit.
- What are you doing wlth me, Rod?

502
00:49:40,162 --> 00:49:45,569
- What?
- Don't you even see? I'm finished.

503
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:51,457
I am fucked!
24 hours ago... I was hot!

504
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:55,202
Now, I'm a cautionary tale.

505
00:49:55,362 --> 00:50:01,475
You see this jacket I'm wearing?
I don't need it. I'm a failure!

506
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:06,467
I lost the number-one draft pick!
Why? Let's recap.

507
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:11,202
Because a hockey player's kid
made me feel like a jerk.

508
00:50:11,362 --> 00:50:15,394
I ate some bad pizza, went to bed
and grew a conscience!

509
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:20,546
Boo-fucking-hoo!

510
00:50:21,954 --> 00:50:29,730
I've got ten years, tops. My next
contract has got to be a big one.

511
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:38,050
I could be out in five years.
What's my family gonna live on?

512
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:44,994
I don't want to hear your shit.
"I lost Cush and Avery..."

513
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:47,778
A drink, please.

514
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:54,275
Anybody else would have left you
by now, but I'm sticking with you.

515
00:50:54,435 --> 00:51:01,410
I'm gonna ride your ass like Zorro
till you show me the money.

516
00:51:03,107 --> 00:51:07,970
We're together on this.
You hear me? We're gonna be one.

517
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:14,498
- The both of us... you know?
- My God!

518
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:21,507
You have no messages.

519
00:51:45,795 --> 00:51:50,628
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.

520
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:56,100
This is not a guy.
It's a syndrome.

521
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,900
It's early mid-life,
don't-let-me-be-alone syndrome.

522
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,604
- But, if that's what you want...
- He's engaged.

523
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:09,860
And for the first time,
I'm part of something I believe in.

524
00:52:10,021 --> 00:52:14,276
Okay...
but he better not be good-looking.

525
00:52:16,037 --> 00:52:20,804
Hi... I'm Jerry Maguire.

526
00:52:20,964 --> 00:52:26,596
Hello.
You're just the way I pictured you.

527
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:31,621
- I'm her disapproving sister.
- Honesty.

528
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,052
Thank you.

529
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,820
Thank you. Dorothy!

530
00:52:40,197 --> 00:52:43,909
Dorothy, your... boss is here.

531
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:46,277
Hello.

532
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:53,957
- Hey, you.
- Thanks for inviting me over.

533
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:59,397
- Where's the little guy?
- He's sleeping.

534
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:07,236
I'm so glad you're home.
Being alone is not my specialty.

535
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:11,557
- My God!
- Yeah.

536
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:17,093
Well, I broke up with Avery.

537
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:26,149
- That's too bad.
- No, it's for the best.

538
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:30,885
We'll still be friends.
It's better now than later.

539
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:37,190
- I'm dying here, aren't I?
- Yeah, it's a reaily bad cut.

540
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,958
Just think if I had got her
the ring she really wanted.

541
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:49,094
Why don't you have a seat?

542
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:54,885
I'll get some aloe vera for the cut.

543
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:58,309
- Do you have something to drink?
- Sure.

544
00:54:04,102 --> 00:54:09,574
- I heard.
- I saw your shoes under the door.

545
00:54:09,735 --> 00:54:13,798
This guy is looking for anyone
who'll show interest.

546
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:18,662
Don't use those.
Use the frosted glasses.

547
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:22,887
- I warmed up some chicken.
- I love you.

548
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:26,662
I won't say any more,
but what about Ray?

549
00:54:26,823 --> 00:54:31,270
He shouldn't hear
a strange man's voice in the house.

550
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:36,614
- A drunken man's voice.
- What about ten angry women?

551
00:54:36,775 --> 00:54:39,910
Lean forward. Okay, I've got it.

552
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:43,238
It's still edible.
Change your shirt.

553
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:52,232
Hi, Jerry.

554
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:57,126
Hi, Ray,
aren't you supposed to be in bed?

555
00:54:57,288 --> 00:55:03,399
- Yeah.
- Don't worry, I won't tell.

556
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:09,479
The human head weighs eight pounds.

557
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:23,207
- Jerry Maguire.
- I think it's this one.

558
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:28,264
You should be dreaming about me.
Think about me constantly.

559
00:55:28,423 --> 00:55:32,327
That's when the big dollars
are gonna flow.

560
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:37,480
- Who is this?
- Rod Tidwell. Where's my agent?

561
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:41,864
- My agent and I should be one.
- Are you a football player?

562
00:55:42,024 --> 00:55:48,328
A football player? I'm a school
teacher about to womp your ass!

563
00:55:48,488 --> 00:55:53,928
I won't say anything else, but you
just can't fall for a drowning man.

564
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:57,799
Which top?
Turtle neck, sensible. V-neck, sexy.

565
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:02,472
What are other women my age
doing right now?

566
00:56:02,632 --> 00:56:05,895
They're out partying
trying to get a man.

567
00:56:06,057 --> 00:56:09,897
Trying to keep a man.
Not me, I'm trying to raise a man.

568
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:15,752
This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day
reminder of Roger for my whole life.

569
00:56:15,913 --> 00:56:20,201
I've had three lovers in four years.

570
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:25,801
All of them ran a distant second
to a good book and a warm bath.

571
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:30,153
I'm the oldest 26-year-old around.
How do I look?

572
00:56:30,313 --> 00:56:33,097
- Good.
- Yeah? Thanks.

573
00:56:33,257 --> 00:56:37,704
72% of new buyers
are African-American.

574
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:41,864
- You talk too much.
- It is a form of communication.

575
00:56:42,026 --> 00:56:46,249
- It was fun talking to you, Rod.
- Jerry...!

576
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:50,121
I'll make you a ham sandwich.

577
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:54,632
- I'm glad you listen to me.
- Well, I love you.

578
00:56:54,793 --> 00:57:01,097
When my dad retired from the
United Way after 38 years, he said:

579
00:57:01,257 --> 00:57:06,121
"I wish they'd given me
a more comfortable chair."

580
00:57:06,313 --> 00:57:12,297
When my dad died, my mom took me
to the zoo and I loved it.

581
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:19,465
- Let me tell you about my dad.
- No, let's go to the zoo.

582
00:57:19,626 --> 00:57:23,434
Okay, you're right.

583
00:57:23,593 --> 00:57:29,609
My whole life I've been
trying to talk... really talk.

584
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:33,865
But no one wants to listen.
You know that feeling?

585
00:57:34,027 --> 00:57:38,186
- They just look at you...
- Let's go to the zoo, right now.

586
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:44,458
The zoo...
the fucking zoo's closed, Ray.

587
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:50,922
- You said "fuck".
- Yeah, I did.

588
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:55,498
- Is that...?
- I won't tell.

589
00:57:55,659 --> 00:58:01,994
Well... then I'm gonna have to
take you to the zoo.

590
00:58:02,154 --> 00:58:06,795
I've got to go to bed,
my mom's coming in.

591
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:14,217
- I've got to go to bed.
- Thanks for listening.

592
00:58:14,379 --> 00:58:22,378
Okay. Drinks, food,
and I called you a cab.

593
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:28,394
- Good idea.
- Quiet, I have a little boy asleep.

594
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:34,090
Our company!

595
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:40,203
A little speech before I go.

596
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:49,834
Do not worry about your future.

597
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:56,139
You and your son are just fine.
You still have a job.

598
00:58:56,907 --> 00:59:02,379
But let me tell you something
about Jerry Maguire.

599
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:07,115
You come after me,
and you will lose.

600
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:11,787
I am a survivor.

601
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:17,676
Dorothy Boyd, you are with
the Lord of the Living Room.

602
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:23,852
The King of the Kingdom
and I am ...

603
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:29,580
...drunk.

604
00:59:37,069 --> 00:59:40,012
We meet again.

605
00:59:52,909 --> 00:59:55,116
Here.

606
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:07,181
- Truth?
- Sure.

607
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:11,181
I care about the job, of course.

608
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:16,525
But mostly,
I just want to be inspired.

609
01:00:16,685 --> 01:00:22,765
- Me, too.
- What you wrote inspired me.

610
01:00:22,925 --> 01:00:27,852
I'm working with you
because of that memo.

611
01:00:28,013 --> 01:00:31,981
I loved that memo.

612
01:00:33,645 --> 01:00:37,197
It was a mission statement.

613
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:54,798
- Well .. .
- Sorry about the hand.

614
01:00:56,973 --> 01:00:59,949
You know that feeling?

615
01:01:00,078 --> 01:01:06,605
You're not completely embarrassed,
but you know tomorrow you will be?

616
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:12,781
- Don't worry about it, boss.
- Shit, you said "boss".

617
01:01:12,942 --> 01:01:18,285
- Yeah, I did.
- Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

618
01:01:18,446 --> 01:01:20,941
I do.

619
01:01:21,103 --> 01:01:25,230
- I'm harassing you right now.
- Well, I may not sue.

620
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:42,351
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

621
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:47,246
Don't worry.

622
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:55,502
I am going to take my one client,
and we are gonna go all the way.

623
01:01:56,814 --> 01:02:00,622
Because... I'm back.

624
01:02:02,031 --> 01:02:06,382
Don't worry.

625
01:02:19,887 --> 01:02:22,350
Good catch.

626
01:02:29,935 --> 01:02:34,768
- He needs a contract, Dennis.
- I'll be at The Crocodile at eight.

627
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:37,903
You bet.

628
01:02:57,552 --> 01:03:01,423
What happened last night?
I thought I was your friend.

629
01:03:01,584 --> 01:03:05,776
- Something came up.
- Okay. $10 million for four years.

630
01:03:05,936 --> 01:03:08,944
- You're dreaming.
- Ten for four.

631
01:03:09,104 --> 01:03:14,992
- He's got an attitude problem.
- He listens to me.

632
01:03:15,152 --> 01:03:19,503
- He's a shrimp.
- He broke all records last year.

633
01:03:19,697 --> 01:03:23,536
I want a prototypical wide-receiver.
6'3", 220 lbs.

634
01:03:23,728 --> 01:03:26,992
Not some shrimp who bitches.

635
01:03:27,152 --> 01:03:33,008
Dennis, I'm asking you...
for a favour.

636
01:03:33,168 --> 01:03:38,608
I introduced you to your wife.
We've spent Christmas together.

637
01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:42,576
- Holiday cheer.
- Jerry, you're reaching.

638
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:47,376
I'm asking you for a favour.
We have history, Dennis.

639
01:03:47,537 --> 01:03:51,792
We got history.
You drove the prices up.

640
01:03:51,985 --> 01:03:56,465
- Now it's your turn to suffer.
- Dennis, don't...

641
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:08,785
I talked with Dennis Wilburn
about your renegotiation.

642
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:12,209
Talking?

643
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:18,225
Jerry Rice, Andre Reed,
Chris Carter, I smoked them all!

644
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:24,945
Yet they're making the big dollars,
the kwan... and you're talking.

645
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:32,593
- Kwan? That's your word?
- Yeah, that's my word.

646
01:04:32,753 --> 01:04:37,809
Some dudes might have the coin,
but they'll never have the kwan.

647
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:43,345
It means love, respect, community,
and dollars, the entire package...

648
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,385
...the kwan.

649
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:54,609
- Great word... towel?
- No, I air-dry.

650
01:04:54,770 --> 01:05:00,081
Listen, Rod... I say this
with great respect for you.

651
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:06,257
But those players you mentioned,
are marquee players.

652
01:05:06,386 --> 01:05:10,193
- This deal...
- Marquee?

653
01:05:10,354 --> 01:05:17,618
This is a renegotiation.
Show them your joy for the game.

654
01:05:17,779 --> 01:05:22,194
Bury the attitude a little bit,
and show them...

655
01:05:22,354 --> 01:05:26,034
- You're telling me to dance.
- No.

656
01:05:26,227 --> 01:05:30,514
Get back to the guy
who first started playing this game.

657
01:05:30,675 --> 01:05:35,986
Way back when you were a kid,
was it just about the money?

658
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:39,730
Was it?
Was it...?

659
01:05:41,683 --> 01:05:47,123
Do your job.
Don't you tell me to dance.

660
01:05:47,282 --> 01:05:51,571
I am an athlete.
I am not an entertainer!

661
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:57,266
I do not dance and I do not start
pre-season without a contract!

662
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:02,163
- Fine, fine, fine!
- Jerry, talk to me.

663
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:05,618
Breathe, Jerry.

664
01:06:07,123 --> 01:06:13,042
I am out here for you.
You don't know what that's like.

665
01:06:13,172 --> 01:06:17,331
It's an up-at-dawn,
pride-swallowing siege -

666
01:06:17,523 --> 01:06:22,034
- that I will never
fully tell you about, okay?

667
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:27,635
God, help me.

668
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:34,451
Help me.
Help me... help you.

669
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:37,971
Help me help you.

670
01:06:44,436 --> 01:06:47,123
I'm sorry.

671
01:06:47,284 --> 01:06:51,891
You are hanging on
by a very thin thread.

672
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:55,764
I dig that about you.

673
01:06:55,956 --> 01:07:00,084
No contract! Help me?
I'll help everybody.

674
01:07:00,244 --> 01:07:04,660
- That's my man.
- Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

675
01:07:04,852 --> 01:07:09,684
- Help me!
- See you in Los Angeles.

676
01:07:09,844 --> 01:07:13,044
Jerry... come on, man.

677
01:07:13,205 --> 01:07:19,668
We ain't fighting,
we're finally talking.

678
01:07:24,148 --> 01:07:28,148
Unless you love everybody,
you can't sell anybody.

679
01:07:37,461 --> 01:07:42,357
Dennis Wilburn is faxing his offer
for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

680
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:46,292
- He said you'd be happy... glad.
- Happy or glad?

681
01:07:47,669 --> 01:07:50,484
Glad. He said glad.

682
01:07:51,253 --> 01:07:56,468
- Glad is good.
- We could sure use that commission.

683
01:07:56,629 --> 01:08:01,173
I did a rundown
on where you stand financially.

684
01:08:03,189 --> 01:08:08,564
- My condo was devalued.
- You don't have to explain.

685
01:08:08,726 --> 01:08:12,085
The other night... I apologize.

686
01:08:12,245 --> 01:08:17,429
- Yeah, what happened there?
- This is a working relationship.

687
01:08:17,622 --> 01:08:19,990
Exactly.

688
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:25,750
The other night I was lonely.
I felt you understood something.

689
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:32,533
We've got a company to think about,
and I'll never try that again.

690
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:38,197
You walked out on a job for me...
Can this be right?

691
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:41,558
Exactly.

692
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,869
I know right now you need
to be alone with your thoughts.

693
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:51,670
Find out what's gone wrong
and fix it .. . alone.

694
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:57,558
Alone! Alone, alone.

695
01:08:59,126 --> 01:09:02,806
- You want to go out to dinner?
- Great!

696
01:09:02,966 --> 01:09:07,893
I broke up with that loser,
and then he started stalking me.

697
01:09:08,086 --> 01:09:15,638
- What do you mean by stalking?
- Coming over uninvited.

698
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:30,486
Excuse me... Ladies.

699
01:09:30,648 --> 01:09:35,479
Good evening,
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

700
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:41,144
- She's in the kitchen.
- Laurel... Hello.

701
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:45,783
- Where are you taking her tonight?
- You're the nanny?

702
01:09:45,943 --> 01:09:48,983
- Au pair.
- Au pair?

703
01:09:50,327 --> 01:09:53,270
Jerry!

704
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:57,174
He likes you.

705
01:09:57,303 --> 01:10:04,343
Ray, I've got some gifts for you.
Do you like presents?

706
01:10:04,503 --> 01:10:09,206
Arizona Cardinals.
It's the team Rod plays for.

707
01:10:09,367 --> 01:10:14,103
- Is that your laundry?
- Would you like a Steelers hat?

708
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:19,191
- I've got it in grey, too.
- Thanks, Jerry.

709
01:10:19,384 --> 01:10:24,759
And I've got an energy bar.
This will keep you up all night.

710
01:10:24,952 --> 01:10:29,112
That's not a good idea.
I'll take that.

711
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,351
Hey, it looks like you've got a fan.

712
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,407
That's more than a dress,
that's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

713
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:46,295
I got a bit revved up at the thought
of an evening among adults.

714
01:10:46,456 --> 01:10:51,159
- Jerry, Chad. Chad, Jerry.
- Yeah... Am I dressed okay?

715
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,039
- Don't let him stay up too late.
- Tonight he'll learn about jazz.

716
01:11:02,201 --> 01:11:05,848
Good,
that'll put him to sleep early.

717
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:08,664
I want to go too.

718
01:11:08,824 --> 01:11:13,592
No, you stay here with Chad
and be good. Kiss me.

719
01:11:13,785 --> 01:11:16,536
Let's go.

720
01:11:17,849 --> 01:11:21,496
- Good night.
- Give me a hug.

721
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:07,193
- I'll meet you at the car.
- You forgot your keys.

722
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:11,257
Ray kissed him just like a dad!

723
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:16,025
Wasn't that thrilling?
He must have been needing that.

724
01:12:16,218 --> 01:12:21,402
Don't cry at the start of a date,
just cry at the end, like I do.

725
01:12:21,561 --> 01:12:24,729
Don't be a shoulder
for him to cry on, either.

726
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:30,650
Keys.
Oh dear...

727
01:12:55,098 --> 01:13:01,529
Ever since you've met me,
I've been...

728
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:07,578
It was laziness,
my breakup with Avery.

729
01:13:07,738 --> 01:13:12,506
It doesn't just happen.
Somebody is always to blame.

730
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:16,507
You work at it
like you do a job.

731
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:21,819
Maybe,
love shouldn't be such hard work.

732
01:13:22,011 --> 01:13:24,891
Yeah, maybe so.

733
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:30,074
But it's not every day you say
goodbye to a woman like that.

734
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:35,066
A song for the lovers?

735
01:13:35,227 --> 01:13:41,242
- No, no, we work together.
- This is like an office meeting.

736
01:13:41,403 --> 01:13:44,123
I know what you mean.

737
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:50,875
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger
was any good, even before ...

738
01:13:51,035 --> 01:13:54,043
Before...?

739
01:13:54,875 --> 01:14:00,219
Jerry...
Let's not tell our sad stories.

740
01:14:05,051 --> 01:14:08,763
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

741
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:40,540
They sting.
Let Chad catch the bee in the glass.

742
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:45,532
He won't hurt him.
You've got such a good heart.

743
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:18,716
- Well, this would be goodnight.
- Goodnight.

744
01:15:18,909 --> 01:15:23,708
I'll see you tomorrow.
It's a big day.

745
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:50,941
- Well, goodnight.
- Goodnight.

746
01:16:27,358 --> 01:16:32,477
- Let me fix this.
- Good idea.

747
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:27,134
I think you should not come in.

748
01:17:27,296 --> 01:17:31,743
Or... come in.

749
01:17:31,903 --> 01:17:37,023
- Depending on how you feel.
- The same to you.

750
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:44,319
No, I have to go in.
I live here.

751
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:55,519
Right.

752
01:17:57,952 --> 01:18:01,664
I'll come in.

753
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:04,959
Good.

754
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,455
Are you sure we want to do this?

755
01:18:18,304 --> 01:18:20,416
Hell, yes!

756
01:18:29,697 --> 01:18:33,121
- Did he have a good night?
- Yeah, he's asleep.

757
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,272
- How did it go with sport-boy?
- Still going.

758
01:18:38,433 --> 01:18:40,416
All right.

759
01:18:44,064 --> 01:18:47,296
Chad... how are you?

760
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:52,992
- Treat her right.
- Yeah...

761
01:18:55,072 --> 01:18:57,856
She's great.

762
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:06,625
I know this might be awkward,
but I want you to use this.

763
01:19:06,786 --> 01:19:09,633
God, Chad...

764
01:19:09,793 --> 01:19:14,752
This is Miles Davis
and John Coltrane.

765
01:19:14,914 --> 01:19:17,856
Stockholm 1963.

766
01:19:18,017 --> 01:19:22,848
Two masters of freedom, playing
before their art was corrupted -

767
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:32,001
- by cocktail-lounge performers
who destroyed this American legacy.

768
01:19:32,161 --> 01:19:34,593
Jazz.

769
01:19:36,065 --> 01:19:40,033
I've put some Mingus
on there, too.

770
01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:50,786
- No barriers, no boundaries...
- Chad, I got it.

771
01:20:41,987 --> 01:20:47,427
You know
this is gonna change everything.

772
01:20:47,587 --> 01:20:51,042
Promise?

773
01:20:55,746 --> 01:20:59,714
What is this muslc?

774
01:21:31,107 --> 01:21:36,611
I love getting up in the morning
and beginning another great day!

775
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:45,154
Great!
Did you really need to do this?

776
01:21:55,715 --> 01:22:02,467
- I'm getting him up, don't worry.
- What? I'm just waiting for coffee.

777
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:06,852
- Just tell me one thing.
- No.

778
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:14,949
I'm worried this guy may not have
an emotional marble in his head.

779
01:22:15,108 --> 01:22:20,836
Laurel, if I start talking . ..
I took a chance, all right?

780
01:22:20,997 --> 01:22:26,180
- This guy's on the bottom rung.
- Maybe I am taking advantage.

781
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:29,668
Does that make me a bad person?

782
01:22:29,828 --> 01:22:35,364
Roger was popular and charming,
and not so nice to me, and he died.

783
01:22:35,525 --> 01:22:42,148
Why should I let this guy go when
my body tells me that he's the one?

784
01:22:42,309 --> 01:22:48,773
- I just wanted the fun details.
- Why didn't you say so?

785
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:55,589
Well, you might be interested
in this one little detail...

786
01:22:57,125 --> 01:23:00,421
I love him.

787
01:23:00,581 --> 01:23:04,773
I do! I love him,
and I don't care what you think.

788
01:23:04,965 --> 01:23:11,204
I love him for the man he wants
to be, and for the man he almost is.

789
01:23:11,398 --> 01:23:16,325
I love him, Laurel. I love him.

790
01:23:16,485 --> 01:23:19,237
Hi, Jerry.

791
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:23,909
Act natural.

792
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:32,966
- Tell me he's not there.
- He's not there.

793
01:23:33,126 --> 01:23:36,485
- Easy, ladies.
- Coffee, Jerry?

794
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:41,797
No, thanks. We bottom feeders
prefer cereal first.

795
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:46,053
- Let's have Apple Jacks.
- Apple Jacks it is.

796
01:23:46,214 --> 01:23:50,214
Dorothy... good morning, darling.

797
01:23:52,839 --> 01:23:55,974
- Good morning.
- What's going on?

798
01:23:56,166 --> 01:24:02,342
A lot. We've got a big fax.
We need this commission.

799
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:06,278
Milk? Cheers.

800
01:24:13,734 --> 01:24:17,478
That was really great of you,
this morning.

801
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:25,063
Let's just root for a big offer
so we can move into a real office.

802
01:24:25,254 --> 01:24:29,127
Would you mind? Thanks a lot.

803
01:24:36,102 --> 01:24:38,406
Shit!

804
01:24:42,566 --> 01:24:47,046
1.7 for three years?
We owe more than that!

805
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:52,870
- I'll get back to them.
- They're fucking us in the ass!

806
01:24:53,063 --> 01:24:56,550
I'm sorry,
I'm a little pregnant right now.

807
01:24:56,710 --> 01:25:02,407
- I feel like crying, Jerry.
- Don't take this so emotionally.

808
01:25:02,535 --> 01:25:06,534
- We'll roll with the problem.
- Why are you so calm?

809
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:13,927
"Don't take it emotionally?"
You need to get emotional.

810
01:25:14,088 --> 01:25:17,928
- Get me Bob Sugar on the phone.
- Marcee...

811
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:24,007
- You want to leave me?
- What exactly do you stand for?

812
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:28,135
- What do you stand for?
- How about integrity?

813
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:33,608
There's so much greed in the world
I don't know what to tell my son!

814
01:25:33,736 --> 01:25:38,087
But this guy isn't yelling,
"Show me the money!"

815
01:25:38,247 --> 01:25:42,888
Do you know he's broke
and working for you for free?

816
01:25:43,848 --> 01:25:47,369
Broke! Broke, broke, broke.

817
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,903
- Sorry, I'm not so good at insults.
- That was pretty good.

818
01:25:55,048 --> 01:25:58,088
Let me show you something.

819
01:26:01,064 --> 01:26:06,088
- Here. Rod, read this.
- No, no, no...

820
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:10,120
This is important, Jerry.

821
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:14,760
- I appreciate this, but...
- You should be proud of that.

822
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:21,512
Tell me what to do. Tell me to eat
lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

823
01:26:22,697 --> 01:26:28,809
Tell me if this is the best
we can get... He's my agent.

824
01:26:28,969 --> 01:26:34,632
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
Reject that shitty contract.

825
01:26:34,825 --> 01:26:40,136
Play out your existing contract,
and next year you're a free agent.

826
01:26:40,329 --> 01:26:45,960
Baby, this is us. You and me.
We determine our worth.

827
01:26:46,121 --> 01:26:52,425
You are a strong, proud,
surviving, splendid black man.

828
01:26:54,344 --> 01:26:59,177
Marcee... you are the shit.

829
01:27:06,153 --> 01:27:11,273
- If you get injured, you get zero.
- It won't happen.

830
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:16,233
Rod, it's a risk.

831
01:27:16,425 --> 01:27:20,969
You bet on me, like I bet on you.

832
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:28,521
You know?

833
01:27:31,306 --> 01:27:34,922
You know, baby?

834
01:27:35,082 --> 01:27:38,602
- You're so crazy .. .
- I love you, baby.

835
01:27:39,242 --> 01:27:44,297
- Let me kiss that head.
- Thank you.

836
01:27:50,346 --> 01:27:55,498
I'm taking that job in San Diego.
You can't afford me.

837
01:27:55,690 --> 01:28:00,905
- You can't afford me.
- I'll find something for Tidwell.

838
01:28:01,066 --> 01:28:04,713
- I refuse to be a drain.
- We'll stay afloat.

839
01:28:04,907 --> 01:28:09,290
We'll stay afloat. Don't leave.

840
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:13,738
- Rod, get on the camel.
- You've been on my ass all day.

841
01:28:13,898 --> 01:28:17,066
- He's my client.
- Get him on the camel.

842
01:28:17,259 --> 01:28:21,643
- We don't need a camel.
- It's a Camel Chevrolet.

843
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:26,250
- See? He's feeling my pain!
- Get on the camel.

844
01:28:26,379 --> 01:28:31,082
- I'm pulling him from this.
- Just get rid of the camel.

845
01:28:31,243 --> 01:28:35,946
- This isn't what I had in mind.
- Right, let's bounce.

846
01:28:37,899 --> 01:28:42,058
Pulling him?
You begged me to hire him.

847
01:28:42,603 --> 01:28:50,186
I know you needed that commission,
but this isn't exactly Reebok.

848
01:28:50,379 --> 01:28:55,307
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Are we gonna be friends now?

849
01:28:55,467 --> 01:29:00,298
- Have you dated any single mothers?
- I was raised by a single mother.

850
01:29:00,492 --> 01:29:05,579
I think, after this, she's gonna
have to take that job in San Diego.

851
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,963
First of all,
single mothers don't date.

852
01:29:10,156 --> 01:29:17,451
They've been to the puppet show
and they've seen the strings.

853
01:29:18,251 --> 01:29:22,891
Do you love her...?
Don't tell me you don't know.

854
01:29:23,052 --> 01:29:27,115
I don't want her to go.
We've been hanging out a lot.

855
01:29:27,276 --> 01:29:31,883
That's bullshit!
You've got to be fair to her.

856
01:29:32,045 --> 01:29:37,740
Single mothers are a sacred thing.
You've got to have the talk.

857
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:43,948
She loves you. If you don't
love her, you've got to tell her.

858
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:49,707
The kid's amazing. He...

859
01:29:51,404 --> 01:29:54,220
I feel you...

860
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:59,277
But a real man wouldn't shoplift
the pooty from a single mother.

861
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:04,780
I didn't shoplift the pooty.

862
01:30:07,853 --> 01:30:12,108
All right, I shoplifted the pooty.

863
01:30:20,557 --> 01:30:25,420
You know, John Coltrane
once said to Miles Davis...

864
01:30:25,581 --> 01:30:30,956
When you say goodbye to him, just
be cool. What's meant to be will be.

865
01:30:31,117 --> 01:30:36,428
You'll see each other. I'm losing
the only person who listens to me.

866
01:30:36,622 --> 01:30:40,108
- Seriously.
- You're doing the right thing.

867
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:45,549
You need to start your life,
not cushion the fall for him.

868
01:30:48,813 --> 01:30:52,493
I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.

869
01:30:56,845 --> 01:31:00,141
Bye.

870
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:09,902
Listen, you're gonna
like it in San Diego, Ray.

871
01:31:10,062 --> 01:31:12,558
Ray...

872
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:17,101
It's gonna be great there.
You'll make a lot of friends.

873
01:31:17,262 --> 01:31:23,149
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Go ahead and go.

874
01:31:27,247 --> 01:31:30,606
Go ahead and go.

875
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:43,854
- Are you okay to drive this?
- This rig? No problem.

876
01:31:44,015 --> 01:31:48,846
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Get in the car.

877
01:31:49,038 --> 01:31:53,741
I'll see you in a couple of days...
and I love you.

878
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:59,311
I love you, too... What?

879
01:31:59,502 --> 01:32:02,894
- Nothing.
- I'll see you soon.

880
01:32:03,086 --> 01:32:07,598
Look, if this weekend
should turn into next month, -

881
01:32:07,758 --> 01:32:13,134
- and next month into whatever,
don't make a joke of your life.

882
01:32:13,294 --> 01:32:16,429
Go back and read what you wrote.

883
01:32:16,623 --> 01:32:21,806
You're better than the Bob Sugars.
Don't forget that.

884
01:32:38,287 --> 01:32:41,935
- Wait a second.
- No! Oh, God.

885
01:32:43,504 --> 01:32:48,240
- We can save on medical...
- Don't listen to him, Dorothy.

886
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:53,328
What if we stay together?
What if we got married?

887
01:32:53,519 --> 01:32:58,767
- Would you stay?
- No, don't do that. Don't say that.

888
01:32:58,927 --> 01:33:02,351
Well... say it if you want to.

889
01:33:06,863 --> 01:33:10,607
Will you marry me?

890
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:18,544
What are you thinking?

891
01:33:47,409 --> 01:33:52,624
Laurel! We're getting married.

892
01:33:52,817 --> 01:33:58,705
Do you, Jerry Magulre,
take this woman to be your wife?

893
01:33:59,056 --> 01:34:05,648
And do you, Dorothy Boyd,
take this man to be your husband?

894
01:34:06,417 --> 01:34:11,728
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

895
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:51,312
I should go.

896
01:35:09,522 --> 01:35:12,402
We did it.

897
01:35:12,562 --> 01:35:16,465
We sure did.

898
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:37,298
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

899
01:35:41,906 --> 01:35:44,562
I'm glad we had this talk.

900
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:50,002
Look at them.

901
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:54,482
She is so beautiful.

902
01:36:08,403 --> 01:36:12,946
I don't believe they taped this.

903
01:36:18,611 --> 01:36:23,538
I'm gonna release this to ESPN.

904
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:29,555
- You think I'm joking.
- No, but I know where you live.

905
01:36:30,932 --> 01:36:35,412
You didn't have the talk, did you?

906
01:36:37,012 --> 01:36:39,347
No.

907
01:36:39,508 --> 01:36:43,891
Well, this definitely
was another way to go.

908
01:36:44,052 --> 01:36:48,403
Hey, Dorothy, come here.
Ladies and gentlemen...

909
01:36:48,564 --> 01:36:54,164
Mr. and Mrs. Maguire.
We're gonna have a great season.

910
01:37:02,612 --> 01:37:07,668
Hey, Scotty.
Tidwell did four for 36.

911
01:37:07,827 --> 01:37:12,307
- Jerry... he's having a good game.
- You bet he is.

912
01:37:12,468 --> 01:37:15,668
You're gonna miss him next year.

913
01:37:19,956 --> 01:37:23,668
I've got a great team behind me
and I'm loving it.

914
01:37:30,197 --> 01:37:35,892
- That's my mo-fo!
- Come here.

915
01:37:36,053 --> 01:37:42,548
Be the first man in the family not
to say that, and we'll let you live.

916
01:37:42,708 --> 01:37:45,620
Go kiss Daddy.

917
01:37:55,124 --> 01:37:59,572
I saw you limping a little,
after the first quarter...

918
01:38:02,165 --> 01:38:07,572
I twisted my ankle.

919
01:38:07,733 --> 01:38:11,925
That went well.
Anybody else worth talking to?

920
01:38:12,117 --> 01:38:14,420
Let's go.

921
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:19,893
- How's your head?
- Terrible.

922
01:38:20,469 --> 01:38:25,909
How you doing, Rod? Tough game.

923
01:38:28,214 --> 01:38:34,294
That quarterback sucks.
He's gonna get me killed.

924
01:38:35,445 --> 01:38:41,909
My brains will be blown loose
before you get me my 10 million.

925
01:38:45,526 --> 01:38:51,030
You take care out on that field.
You're my entire client roster.

926
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:55,445
- Go home to your wife.
- What's that supposed to mean?

927
01:38:55,574 --> 01:39:01,557
- What are you doing here?
- Giving you personal attention.

928
01:39:01,718 --> 01:39:04,822
- You don't want to go home.
- What?

929
01:39:04,982 --> 01:39:09,557
I'm just trying to talk to you.
How's your marriage?

930
01:39:09,718 --> 01:39:13,877
The husband and wife thing,
how is that?

931
01:39:19,607 --> 01:39:24,758
- Not everyone has what you have.
- Why did you get married?

932
01:39:24,918 --> 01:39:29,077
- I'm just asking as a friend.
- You want an answer?

933
01:39:29,238 --> 01:39:33,079
Loyalty... she was loyal.

934
01:39:37,335 --> 01:39:41,334
Everything... grew from there.

935
01:39:42,135 --> 01:39:46,550
It just... grew from there.

936
01:39:47,671 --> 01:39:52,182
- That's an answer?
- That's the answer.

937
01:39:52,375 --> 01:39:56,726
It's not sexy...
but that's an answer.

938
01:39:56,887 --> 01:40:02,967
"Tell him what he's won, Bob.
A beautiful marriage!" Shit!

939
01:40:03,159 --> 01:40:08,504
I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, Rod.

940
01:40:09,528 --> 01:40:15,384
I have a question for you.
Are we really friends?

941
01:40:15,576 --> 01:40:21,750
You know, friends can tell
each other anything, right?

942
01:40:21,944 --> 01:40:26,487
I'll tell you why you don't
have your $10 million.

943
01:40:26,648 --> 01:40:31,479
You play for the money. You play
with your head, not your heart.

944
01:40:31,672 --> 01:40:37,047
When you get on the field,
it's all about what you didn't get.

945
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:42,839
Who's to blame. Who's got
the contract you didn't get.

946
01:40:42,999 --> 01:40:48,759
That is not what inspires people!

947
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:52,152
Shut up!
Play the game from your heart.

948
01:40:52,344 --> 01:40:57,271
Then I'll show you the kwan.
And that's the truth!

949
01:40:57,432 --> 01:41:03,064
Can you handle it?
It's just a question from a friend.

950
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:08,152
When they call you "shrimp",
I'm the one who defends you!

951
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:13,464
I don't want to be friends no more.
And quit using that word kwan.

952
01:41:14,008 --> 01:41:17,336
- I'll see you in L.A.
- No heart?

953
01:41:17,496 --> 01:41:21,720
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

954
01:41:56,825 --> 01:42:03,513
- How many concussions has he had?
- I can't get no respect.

955
01:42:20,538 --> 01:42:25,145
I went to see this so-called
black film the other day.

956
01:42:25,338 --> 01:42:32,985
No more salt for you. The biggest
game of the season is coming up.

957
01:42:33,722 --> 01:42:39,770
20 minutes of coming attractions.
All black films and all violent.

958
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:44,666
- Brothers shooting brothers .. .
- I hate you going out alone.

959
01:42:44,826 --> 01:42:50,266
- Oh, baby .. .
- My Pisces queen.

960
01:42:51,962 --> 01:42:56,121
I hate seeing movies without you.

961
01:42:56,282 --> 01:43:01,657
I won't do it anymore, okay?

962
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:13,529
- Baby.
- Baby!

963
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:17,051
- Now?
- Baby now!

964
01:43:17,882 --> 01:43:24,794
- Ray, it's time to go.
- Do you take Visa? Take it!

965
01:43:26,235 --> 01:43:33,435
What were you thinking tonight,
watching them go through that?

966
01:43:33,595 --> 01:43:40,122
I was thinking,
"I hope he doesn't get injured."

967
01:43:41,787 --> 01:43:47,067
Sometimes I can't tell at all what's
going on in that head of yours.

968
01:43:51,995 --> 01:43:58,331
- And I don't know your noises yet.
- Well, when you wonder, ask me.

969
01:43:58,491 --> 01:44:02,363
Okay, I will.

970
01:44:02,524 --> 01:44:07,547
I thought I just did.

971
01:44:09,596 --> 01:44:13,372
- Why do you love me?
- Why do you love me?

972
01:44:13,532 --> 01:44:18,779
- Jerry, can I come and watch TV?
- Just for a few minutes.

973
01:44:37,052 --> 01:44:41,436
- He's not going anywhere.
- I know.

974
01:44:41,595 --> 01:44:47,675
- Can we talk about somethlng else?
- No, I'm incapable of small talk.

975
01:44:47,868 --> 01:44:51,804
But that's why you love me, right?

976
01:45:02,844 --> 01:45:08,476
I'm about personal attention.
I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

977
01:45:08,668 --> 01:45:13,404
I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow
for Monday Night Football.

978
01:45:13,565 --> 01:45:19,357
I can be in Indiana
by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

979
01:45:19,517 --> 01:45:26,461
I don't need an answer now.
I'll call you tomorrow.

980
01:45:26,621 --> 01:45:32,027
All right, thank you, Marilee.

981
01:45:33,213 --> 01:45:37,532
Indiana, Tuesday.
I'll be there.

982
01:45:40,797 --> 01:45:45,117
- It's my fault.
- What?

983
01:45:45,693 --> 01:45:51,325
It's not fair to you,
this whole thing.

984
01:45:52,605 --> 01:45:57,885
Come here.
Tell me, let me help.

985
01:45:58,078 --> 01:46:03,484
I took advantage of you and
I did it with the help of a kid.

986
01:46:04,829 --> 01:46:09,726
I was just on some wild ride.
I thought...

987
01:46:09,886 --> 01:46:15,325
I thought I was in love enough
for both of us.

988
01:46:15,486 --> 01:46:22,781
I jumped at your proposal
when it was still just hypothetical.

989
01:46:23,742 --> 01:46:29,886
I did this, and at least
I can do something about it now.

990
01:46:30,046 --> 01:46:34,910
I'm not a guy who runs.
I stick.

991
01:46:36,798 --> 01:46:43,294
- I don't need you to stick.
- What do you want? My soul?

992
01:46:43,454 --> 01:46:49,150
- Why not? I deserve that.
- What if I'm not built that way?

993
01:46:51,135 --> 01:46:56,927
- I think we made a mistake.
- What if it's true?

994
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,798
Great at friendship,
bad at intimacy.

995
01:47:00,959 --> 01:47:04,734
That's the theme
of my bachelor film.

996
01:47:04,895 --> 01:47:08,893
I know, I watched lt.
I know it by heart.

997
01:47:12,447 --> 01:47:17,150
- I don't like to give up.
- Please...

998
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:22,208
My need to make the best of things,
and your need to be responsible ...

999
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:27,967
If we don't do something now, we
could lose ten years being polite.

1000
01:47:30,815 --> 01:47:36,254
Let's just call this next road trip
what it really is:

1001
01:47:36,415 --> 01:47:40,223
A nice long break.

1002
01:47:46,687 --> 01:47:49,759
What about Ray?

1003
01:47:52,128 --> 01:47:55,712
Well, you'll be friends.

1004
01:47:55,871 --> 01:47:59,358
- Friends?
- Yes.

1005
01:48:01,472 --> 01:48:08,447
- Of course you'll be friends.
- I'll take him to the zoo.

1006
01:48:09,888 --> 01:48:18,079
- So this break is a breakup.
- Come on, this isn't easy for me.

1007
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:21,855
On the surface
everything looks fine.

1008
01:48:22,016 --> 01:48:29,024
I've got this great guy,
and he loves my kid.

1009
01:48:30,688 --> 01:48:33,663
And he sure does like me a lot.

1010
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:43,264
And I can't live like that.

1011
01:48:44,896 --> 01:48:48,032
It's not how I'm built.

1012
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:23,872
If this is empty,
this doesn't matter.

1013
01:49:44,769 --> 01:49:48,833
It was just a mission statement.

1014
01:50:18,434 --> 01:50:22,498
Hey, Rod, how are you doing?
How's it going?

1015
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:24,898
Go.

1016
01:50:26,722 --> 01:50:30,498
- Where's your agent?
- I don't know.

1017
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:35,202
You belong with the big boys.
You belong with the big money.

1018
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:39,169
- You're Rod Tidwell!
- Get away from my guy.

1019
01:50:39,362 --> 01:50:43,778
- I was just handling it.
- Just go. Flee.

1020
01:50:43,938 --> 01:50:49,857
This is a nice moment for you.
I'm gonna let you have it.

1021
01:50:50,019 --> 01:50:54,211
Give me a call, Rod.
Say hi to Marcee.

1022
01:51:00,195 --> 01:51:05,506
- Thanks for coming.
- I missed you.

1023
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:09,313
What can I say?
You're all I've got.

1024
01:51:11,555 --> 01:51:16,707
This is Frank Gifford in Tempe,
Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium.

1025
01:51:16,868 --> 01:51:21,860
The Cardinals are still alive
for a play-off spot.

1026
01:51:22,019 --> 01:51:28,067
The reason for that is the
outstandlng play of Rod Tidwell.

1027
01:51:28,259 --> 01:51:34,019
The Dallas Cowboys are on a roll.
They know they're in the play-offs.

1028
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:38,659
If Arizona wins tonight
and next week, -

1029
01:51:38,819 --> 01:51:44,450
- they'll make the play-offs
for the flrst time in 21 years.

1030
01:51:44,612 --> 01:51:48,131
You'd better not mess up tonight.

1031
01:51:48,356 --> 01:51:52,611
What did I say? He's always
nervous for televised games.

1032
01:51:52,772 --> 01:51:57,603
The Cowboys contlnue their mlssion
on Monday Night Football.

1033
01:52:04,739 --> 01:52:09,699
Hey, Shannon.
Great column this morning.

1034
01:52:23,781 --> 01:52:26,020
What a bruiser.

1035
01:52:26,181 --> 01:52:33,124
The Cardinals just refuse to go
quietly into the desert night.

1036
01:52:33,284 --> 01:52:37,635
I'm just trying
to be a little poetic.

1037
01:52:39,076 --> 01:52:42,756
A tough hit on Tidwell.

1038
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:48,453
- I'd have made a touchdown.
- That's his sixth catch tonlght.

1039
01:52:48,613 --> 01:52:52,676
A first down
at the 19 yard line.

1040
01:52:52,836 --> 01:53:00,036
- Another savage hit on Tidwell.
- They're really working Tidwell.

1041
01:53:00,197 --> 01:53:06,372
- What does Daddy always say?
- It looks worse than it is.

1042
01:53:06,533 --> 01:53:11,108
- He's gonna kill himself.
- Will you be quiet!

1043
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:14,853
Two minutes to play.
Dallas leading by three.

1044
01:53:15,013 --> 01:53:18,949
Second down and one,
at the Dallas 11 yard line.

1045
01:53:21,125 --> 01:53:24,902
Down he goes for a slx yard loss.

1046
01:53:25,637 --> 01:53:27,940
Good move.

1047
01:53:28,102 --> 01:53:31,974
Swenson had too many men
in that pattern.

1048
01:53:34,598 --> 01:53:39,365
90 razor,
X-out on one, ready?

1049
01:53:41,734 --> 01:53:44,646
They had a chance there.

1050
01:53:44,806 --> 01:53:49,350
But from second and one
they've gone to third and seven.

1051
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:53,062
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.

1052
01:53:53,254 --> 01:53:58,469
Tidwell in motion.
Moving back to his left.

1053
01:53:58,629 --> 01:54:04,709
Swenson puts one into the endzone.
Tidwell Touchdown Cardinals!

1054
01:54:04,871 --> 01:54:09,925
Tidwell held onto the football,
but he's still down on the ground.

1055
01:54:10,118 --> 01:54:15,270
He hit the ground hard, but managed
to maintain control of the football.

1056
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:19,589
- He's hurt, too.
- He's not getting up.

1057
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:24,325
- Look at the players' faces.
- Get up, baby.

1058
01:54:24,519 --> 01:54:31,654
The trainer ls on the field. It was
Tidwell's ninth catch of the night.

1059
01:54:40,743 --> 01:54:45,031
Can you hear me, Rod?

1060
01:54:51,367 --> 01:54:54,919
Commercial! Show me what's wrong
with my husband.

1061
01:54:55,078 --> 01:54:58,213
I told you he was
too small for the NFL.

1062
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:03,143
- I'm just stating the truth.
- Tee Pee, shut up!

1063
01:55:03,304 --> 01:55:08,104
Can't you be loyal to your brother?
Get the hell out of my house!

1064
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:12,134
Hello? Hold on.
It's Jerry Maguire.

1065
01:55:12,903 --> 01:55:15,399
Punk!

1066
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:22,598
- Jerry, I am freaking out.
- Marcee, he's unconscious.

1067
01:55:22,759 --> 01:55:26,983
Just stay calm.
I'll call you back.

1068
01:55:27,111 --> 01:55:29,991
There are good doctors here.

1069
01:55:30,184 --> 01:55:36,551
- I cannot stay calm.
- Stay calm.

1070
01:55:36,712 --> 01:55:39,592
Your family needs you to stay calm.

1071
01:55:39,784 --> 01:55:46,248
My whole life is this family,
and it does not work without him!

1072
01:55:46,408 --> 01:55:53,063
All eyes here at Sun Devil Stadium
are focused on Rod Tidwell.

1073
01:55:53,225 --> 01:55:58,631
Just do whatever you can
to get Rod to me.

1074
01:55:58,792 --> 01:56:02,567
Do whatever you can.
Please, Jerry.

1075
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:08,071
At a time like thls, you just hope
his familly is not watching this.

1076
01:56:08,648 --> 01:56:12,455
It could be his neck.
It could be his back.

1077
01:56:16,105 --> 01:56:19,048
Blink! Wake up!

1078
01:56:31,337 --> 01:56:34,856
Rod! Can you hear me?

1079
01:56:35,048 --> 01:56:39,656
Can you hear me?
Do you know where you are?

1080
01:56:39,849 --> 01:56:43,816
The trainer is still trying
to revive Tidwell.

1081
01:56:44,905 --> 01:56:48,329
- Rod...?
- Let's get him off the field.

1082
01:56:48,489 --> 01:56:51,432
- No...
- Get him off the field.

1083
01:56:51,592 --> 01:56:56,039
Wait, wait...
Let me enjoy this for a minute.

1084
01:56:56,201 --> 01:57:01,416
We're looking for some movement.
Is that his head coming up?

1085
01:57:01,577 --> 01:57:06,089
He's trying to get up.
He is getting up.

1086
01:57:20,905 --> 01:57:25,641
- The whole stadium is standing.
- He's up on his feet.

1087
01:57:53,545 --> 01:57:59,593
Here's a guy who's normally
very truculent with the media.

1088
01:58:14,058 --> 01:58:19,113
Rod, we're happy for you, buddy.

1089
01:58:34,026 --> 01:58:37,994
- Congratulations, Jerry.
- Thank you.

1090
01:58:38,155 --> 01:58:41,195
Congratulations.

1091
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:46,410
Jerry... Maguire!

1092
01:58:49,931 --> 01:58:52,842
I know.

1093
01:59:11,724 --> 01:59:14,219
Where's Jerry?

1094
01:59:32,908 --> 01:59:37,132
- We did it.
- You did it.

1095
01:59:38,412 --> 01:59:42,155
Why don't we have
that kind of relationship?

1096
01:59:49,612 --> 01:59:53,196
Is that your phone or mine?

1097
01:59:54,924 --> 01:59:57,611
Dorothy?

1098
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:01,261
Marcee... No, he's right here.

1099
02:00:06,668 --> 02:00:11,148
We did it. I love you so much!

1100
02:00:15,149 --> 02:00:18,348
I love you!

1101
02:00:22,156 --> 02:00:28,236
I love you, Tyson.
How's the baby?

1102
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:49,325
The problem is, like you
were saying, the biorhythms.

1103
02:00:49,485 --> 02:00:57,644
The neural pathways are set,
so it's hard for people to change.

1104
02:01:01,453 --> 02:01:08,077
I'm sorry, these stupid holidays
are making me feel more divorced.

1105
02:01:08,078 --> 02:01:11,021
The songs, the chocolate...

1106
02:01:26,221 --> 02:01:29,709
I have a confession to make.

1107
02:01:29,869 --> 02:01:37,038
I've listened to you all
tell a thousand sob-stories.

1108
02:01:37,197 --> 02:01:43,277
Maybe you're all correct.
Men are the enemy.

1109
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:48,431
But I still love the enemy.

1110
02:02:01,646 --> 02:02:05,198
Hello.

1111
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:09,135
I'm looking for my wife.

1112
02:02:19,438 --> 02:02:22,798
Wait...

1113
02:02:30,543 --> 02:02:35,823
If this is where it has to happen,
then this is where it has to happen.

1114
02:02:35,983 --> 02:02:41,487
I'm not letting you get rid of me.
How about that?

1115
02:02:46,063 --> 02:02:51,823
This used to be my specialty.
I was good in a living room.

1116
02:02:52,335 --> 02:02:55,919
And now, I just...

1117
02:03:07,056 --> 02:03:15,119
Tonight... our little company
had a very big night.

1118
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:19,439
A very, very big night.

1119
02:03:21,903 --> 02:03:25,903
But it wasn't complete.

1120
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:32,208
It wasn't nearly close
to being complete.

1121
02:03:32,368 --> 02:03:36,431
I couldn't share it with you.

1122
02:03:36,591 --> 02:03:39,599
I couldn't hear your voice.

1123
02:03:40,304 --> 02:03:43,247
I couldn't laugh about it with you.

1124
02:03:44,848 --> 02:03:48,239
I missed my... I missed my wife.

1125
02:04:03,793 --> 02:04:09,328
We live in a cynical world.

1126
02:04:09,488 --> 02:04:14,352
And we work in a business
of tough competitors.

1127
02:04:23,088 --> 02:04:29,872
I love you. You... complete me.

1128
02:04:31,154 --> 02:04:36,529
- And I just...
- Shut up!

1129
02:04:36,690 --> 02:04:43,153
You had me at "hello".

1130
02:04:53,842 --> 02:04:57,106
What a great discussion group.

1131
02:04:57,330 --> 02:05:01,681
Your father leaves home
on Christmas Eve.

1132
02:05:01,874 --> 02:05:06,129
Your mother had to sweep up
to pay your tuition.

1133
02:05:06,290 --> 02:05:13,362
Your brother lost a leg.
You've had a pretty horrific life.

1134
02:05:13,522 --> 02:05:19,026
- I'm not gonna cry, Roy.
- Well, I've got some good news.

1135
02:05:19,186 --> 02:05:24,882
I've got a contract here from the
Arizona Cardinals. Four years.

1136
02:05:25,073 --> 02:05:31,057
$11.2 million and you'll get
to play in your home state.

1137
02:05:31,218 --> 02:05:34,962
What do think of that?

1138
02:05:50,802 --> 02:05:55,922
I love everybody.
I love my wife! Marcee!

1139
02:05:57,170 --> 02:06:00,850
I love my kids.
Tyson and my new baby.

1140
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:06,386
My older brother and
my younger brother Tee Pee.

1141
02:06:06,547 --> 02:06:09,906
You're militant, but I love you.

1142
02:06:10,067 --> 02:06:15,666
- I love my teammates.
- We only have a half-hour show.

1143
02:06:16,755 --> 02:06:23,443
Jerry... Congratulations.
Good for you.

1144
02:06:23,635 --> 02:06:28,627
- Hi, Jerry, you remember Troy.
- Yeah, we met in '93.

1145
02:06:28,787 --> 02:06:31,699
I enjoyed your memo.

1146
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:36,627
- The Cardinals finally came around.
- We're out of time.

1147
02:06:36,787 --> 02:06:40,243
Wait, I'm forgetting somebody.

1148
02:06:40,435 --> 02:06:44,723
Jerry Maguire, my agent.

1149
02:06:47,539 --> 02:06:51,731
You are my ambassador
of kwan, man.

1150
02:06:51,891 --> 02:06:56,115
Rod, thank you...
We'll be right back.

1151
02:06:59,732 --> 02:07:04,211
- How did you like the zoo, buddy?
- It was great!

1152
02:07:09,428 --> 02:07:14,131
Hey, kid, throw the ball.

1153
02:07:25,685 --> 02:07:30,548
- Did you see?
- Oh, no... Let's go.

1154
02:07:30,708 --> 02:07:35,892
What? He won't make
the major leagues tomorrow.

1155
02:07:36,052 --> 02:07:43,284
But you can see he's got talent
and I know the right people...

1156
02:07:55,764 --> 02:07:58,964
I don't have all the answers.

1157
02:07:59,125 --> 02:08:03,732
In life, I've failed
as much as I've succeeded.

1158
02:08:03,925 --> 02:08:10,517
But I love my wife, I love life,
and I wish you my kind of success.
