1
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:38,992
The late fourth century A.D. The Roman Empire began to crumble.

2
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:41,866
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,

3
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,841
still retained some of its lustre,...

4
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:45,836
...possessed one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world:...

5
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,735
...the legendary lighthouse,

6
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:50,284
and the biggest library known.

7
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,917
The library was a not only cultural but a religious symbol,...

8
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,000
a place where the pagans worshiped their ancestral gods.

9
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,708
The traditional pagan worship in the city now coexisted...

10
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,661
...with the Jews,

11
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:01,681
and an unstoppable religion up to now banned, ...

12
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:02,822
...Christianity.

13
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:27,500
How many fools do you think have asked themselves

14
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:30,313
why don't the stars fall from the sky

15
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,542
But you, who've had the teachings of the wise,

16
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,188
You know that the stars move neither up nor down,

17
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:40,000
and merely revolve from east to west,

18
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:43,646
following the most perfect course ever can seived,

19
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,521
the circle.

20
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:54,479
Because the circle reigns in heaven,

21
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,917
the stars have never fallen and they never will.

22
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:01,771
But what about here on Earth?

23
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:07,917
Here, bodies do fall.

24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,292
But their movements are not circular but linear.

25
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:13,750
Watch again.

26
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,729
Watch again.

27
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,479
No, leave it.

28
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,292
So,

29
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:25,729
What mysterious wonder do you would think

30
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,215
might be lurking beneath the earth

31
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:30,938
that would make every single person and animal

32
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:33,958
and object and slave settle there.

33
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:36,979
What might it be?

34
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:39,688
The heaviness, lady.

35
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:41,042
No.

36
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,833
Synesius.

37
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:50,625
Their weightiness.

38
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,445
No, you are both speaking about the same thing,

39
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:55,938
but you not talking about primary course.

40
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:01,563
Has any of you ever wondered at the thought that your...

41
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,958
that your feet ...

42
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,313
your feet

43
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,854
are standing on the very center of the cosmos

44
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,458
that holds all things together,

45
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,854
and pulls them together.

46
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,724
If there were no center,

47
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:20,531
then the universe would be shapeless, infinite,

48
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:22,708
formless, chaotic.

49
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,210
Well, it'll make little difference that

50
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:25,181
if we were here, there or anywhere,

51
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,547
and we'd all be better off never having been born.

52
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:34,063
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

53
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,167
God, our Father,

54
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,146
lord of the universe,

55
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:53,438
origin of all things,

56
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,417
eternal force of the cosmos,

57
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:59,583
where everything has its beginning and everything its end.

58
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:01,604
All Mighty Serapis,

59
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:02,676
Isis

60
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:03,530
Horus

61
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,271
Anubis

62
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:08,438
And all the gods that give child protection

63
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:11,042
both in heaven and on earth ...

64
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,875
Something in the market.

65
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:03,065
I know you also feel something as well.

66
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,167
I've seen.

67
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,333
Tell the master that we're leaving.

68
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:23,657
Can you believe.

69
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,708
He was courting me as if I was one of his conquests.

70
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,354
This Orestes is as foolish as his father.

71
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,521
If I had already suggested that he devoted his heart to another muse

72
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,333
one more beautiful than I.

73
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,729
- Who?  - Music.

74
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,813
Music

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,375
He didn't find it amusing.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,438
But how could 227 had become 16 ?

77
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,458
Look at this, it's 14.

78
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,667
They behave like humans!

79
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:59,583
They eat, drink and fornicate!

80
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:05,993
If my gods eat, drink and fornicate,

81
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:06,979
good for them.

82
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,625
No this, no this

83
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,958
you who console yourself with pagan images.

84
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,771
Men, women, birds, reptiles!

85
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,315
Serapis! Serapis!

86
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:25,521
Who could trust the God, with a flower pot for a crown?

87
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,175
Hey You, Christians,

88
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:28,676
how arrogant you've become now

89
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:31,563
that the Empire allows you to exist

90
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:34,583
My father's father saw them

91
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:38,542
slaughtered at the circus and fed to the lions.

92
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,333
Enough! Enough! Watch.

93
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,313
Watch.

94
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,229
I shall now walk cross the fire.

95
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:52,917
If my god ...

96
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:59,271
If my God is the true god, I shall suffer no harm.

97
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,146
If however your gods exist,

98
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,063
they'll roast me like a pig.

99
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:06,250
You ...

100
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,583
You're a man!

101
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,250
You'll burn!

102
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,646
You will have what you deserve!

103
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,813
Now let's see if you can walk cross the fire.

104
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,771
What are you doing?

105
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,688
Stop, you can not do that! Let the man go.

106
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,292
Be quiet, pagen!

107
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,292
Or we will pull you as well.

108
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:04,792
Whose is this?

109
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,083
Whose is this?

110
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,813
How many times must I repeat myself?

111
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:18,854
Today, the Christians burned a man

112
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:21,979
right in the middle of agora!

113
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,479
I will not have this in my house!

114
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,042
Not in the house of Theon!

115
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,958
Give it to me.

116
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,188
Give it to me!

117
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,917
Master, I beg your mercy if you let her go.

118
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,167
- Davus!  - Get up.

119
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,354
You have nothing to do with this.

120
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:47,917
I too, am a Christian.

121
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,604
What did you say?

122
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:53,526
I too. I am a Christian.

123
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,729
Punish me for the both of us.

124
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,521
So, now they presumed to teach us mercy

125
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:04,479
- Get a whip.  - Father!

126
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:09,375
Please wait until you calm, will you?

127
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,583
Father, I beg of you. I beg of you

128
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,958
Wrapped in... in a blazing brightness?

129
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,495
It was the flames, stupid.

130
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:28,989
Then why did not he burned like the pagan?

131
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,688
Tell me.

132
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,771
Leave us ...

133
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,396
Come here.

134
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,083
Then kneel.

135
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,500
Tell me, is that true you are a Christian?

136
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,234
I do not know what to say, mistress.

137
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:21,276
Why not?

138
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,479
If I said yes, that would be a lie

139
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:27,494
If I had said no, it meant I lied to my master

140
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,293
and I do not know which is worse.

141
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,667
Then you should say nothing at all.

142
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,438
There.

143
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,979
Thank you.

144
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:48,438
I want to know that the master is upset with himself about this.

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,354
What is that?

146
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,497
Something I made, mistress.

147
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:02,708
But it looks like a ...

148
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:06,667
What is it?

149
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,583
It's Ptolemaic system.

150
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,354
Yes, it is.

151
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,208
Did you make this?

152
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:18,438
Earth

153
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,667
is the center of the cosmos.

154
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,208
And revolving around it

155
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,066
the sun and the five wanderers:

156
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,938
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

157
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,719
Obstinately disobeying the law of the circle.

158
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,208
Nevertheless. Ptolemy shows us

159
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,271
that they do obey.

160
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:40,313
The fact that we see them move in a loop

161
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,750
is due to the joint effect of two circles.

162
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,125
One that travel around the Earth

163
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:53,958
and another less circle proper to each wanderer.

164
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,913
Well, look, the epicycles

165
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,708
So you see is not heaven on the earth

166
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,521
but our eyes deceive us.

167
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,708
Well said, Davus.

168
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,589
I'd like you to know that your exposition shows me

169
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:11,979
you are paying closer attention than one or two..others here

170
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,078
I tell you The Gods should consulted to me

171
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,438
before they created anything.

172
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,667
Why do you say that? Orestes

173
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,479
It all seemed so whimsical!

174
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,292
Why the joint effect of two circles?

175
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:32,510
Would not it be more perfect if the wander is didn't wander

176
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,521
and the single circle gives sense to everything?

177
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,750
Orestes, by what authority did you judge the work of God?

178
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,333
What is wrong with you, Christians?

179
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,979
Can a man no longer open his mouth in this city

180
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,688
You critisize creation,you critisize our Lords,

181
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,094
and you offended us.

182
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:52,292
You should move to the desert.

183
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,375
You will not hear anything to offend you out there.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,021
You know nothing about what you speak. None of you.

185
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,000
Synesius, What is Euclid's first rule?

186
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,438
Why is the question?

187
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,104
Just.. answer me.

188
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,896
If ...

189
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,229
if two things are equal a third thing,

190
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,417
and they are all equal to each other

191
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:22,083
Good.

192
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,417
Now, are you both now similar to me?

193
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:30,417
Yes

194
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,188
And you, Orestes?

195
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,583
Yes

196
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,000
Now I am actually saying this to everybody here in this room,

197
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,333
more things unit us than divide us.

198
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:46,979
Now whatever may be going on the streets, we are brothers.

199
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,583
We are brothers.

200
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,031
I want you to remember,

201
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:53,646
the bros of slaves and riffraff.

202
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,333
Now  I think we should all honred Davus's with

203
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,417
some very well end applause, so...

204
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:10,000
They'll judge us all alive and dead!

205
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,396
And then it will be too late,

206
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:16,458
because only those who believed in Jesus

207
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,229
will be saved.

208
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,729
What are you waiting for?

209
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:22,813
What are you waiting for?

210
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,146
The Kingdom of God is upon us.

211
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:29,271
Do you understand what I am telling you?

212
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,729
Yes

213
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,542
Do you understand like man do

214
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,146
or do you not had, like sheep?

215
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,396
What are you looking here?

216
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,375
Yes, you.

217
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,250
What are you looking here?

218
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:48,750
Are you Ammonius,

219
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:50,206
the man who formed the miracle?

220
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:53,333
Do you want to see a miracle?

221
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:55,625
Are you the one?

222
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:57,083
I am.

223
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,000
Come with me.

224
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,563
Jesus went throughout Galilee

225
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,958
teaching in their synagogues,

226
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,771
and preaching the good news of the kingdom

227
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:16,042
and healing every disease and sickness among people.

228
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,208
His fame went throughout all Syria

229
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,750
and people came to see him worldwide.

230
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,625
That's Theophilus.

231
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,125
The bishop.

232
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,917
For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

233
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,625
Blessed are they that mourn

234
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,229
for they shall be comforted.

235
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,396
Blessed are the meek

236
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:46,250
for they shall inherit the earth.

237
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:50,833
Blessed are those who have hunger and thirst for righteousness

238
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,750
for they will be filled.

239
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,208
The word of God!

240
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,292
Blessed are the merciful

241
00:16:57,813 --> 00:16:59,479
for they will be find mercy.

242
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,125
Blessed are the pure in heart,

243
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,313
for they will see God.

244
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,000
The Lord be with you.

245
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,563
With you too.

246
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,646
So how did you escape the flames?

247
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,354
- The Lord be with you. - And with you.

248
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,375
What did you think? I pray!

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,438
You probably do not even know how.

250
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:28,333
What do you have in your sack?

251
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:31,146
- Do you have any food of you? - It is for my master.

252
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:33,125
What's wrong with you?

253
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:36,042
I have to pay for that with my own money!

254
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,646
What do you need money for?

255
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,354
Look at the faces.

256
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,875
Here.

257
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,583
I want you to try it yourself

258
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:53,229
and afterwards I will teach you how to pray.

259
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,792
Come on

260
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,729
- The Lord be with you. - Bless you.

261
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:02,604
See?

262
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,583
That is the miracle!

263
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:07,708
Go on, keep doing it.

264
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:14,896
The Lord be with you.

265
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,667
Please.

266
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:19,792
Thank you.

267
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,354
Bless you,

268
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,375
God bless you.

269
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:32,604
Bless you.

270
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,208
Hi slave

271
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,667
What is your name?

272
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:58,229
Davus.

273
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,938
Davus the slaves!

274
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,375
You look like a true parabolan.

275
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,083
A true soldier of Christ.

276
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,438
What do they saying this?

277
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,729
Telling them to dance.

278
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:23,438
The men are now happy with wine.

279
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,500
All aboard!

280
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:28,958
What unfortunate!

281
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,146
Save your servants!

282
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:32,917
End the act two!

283
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:44,583
Thank you, the audience.

284
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:47,871
Excuse for the delay when we move things around

285
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:48,958
and change our costumes.

286
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,688
Forgive me

287
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:02,188
Forgive my boldness.

288
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:04,063
I am Orestes,

289
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,729
son of Orestes.

290
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,958
I am here. ..

291
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:15,313
I am here to declare my love for Hypatia, the philosopher,

292
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:18,021
who no doubt know.

293
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,833
Some time, now following her counsel,

294
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:23,854
I devoted myself to music

295
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:27,396
hope so seeking solace in the harmony of it sound.

296
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,104
But for me,

297
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,271
such harmony resides only in my lady.

298
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:37,292
So,

299
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,938
my purpose here is merely to

300
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,229
offer my melody

301
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,833
and I hope to ...

302
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,521
Stop talking.

303
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,375
That man will go far. I tell you

304
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:54,896
If my prepared food for the banana not the fig,

305
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:56,563
I would have already falls that out his feet.

306
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:01,979
What did it to be best to present

307
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,750
Me?

308
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:05,893
How?

309
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:08,130
Gratty, can you on your daughter's hand.

310
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:10,408
Would don't you ever plan to marry her of?

311
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:14,670
Hypatia, subject to a man? Without read and to teach?

312
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,624
Or even to speak her mind?

313
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:21,531
The most brilliant philosopher I know,

314
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:23,646
having to give up her science

315
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,771
No, could be a death to her.

316
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:34,375
That's true. Her work is admirable.

317
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,708
And she's wise and virtuous.

318
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,751
But Theon,

319
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,750
do not forget her situation.

320
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,354
Being a Woman, I believe

321
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,542
Our Father, who art in heaven, reveal bear

322
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,083
Don't let anyone else have her

323
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:07,604
Please do not let anyone else have her

324
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:13,125
Do not let anyone. Do not let anyone else have her.

325
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,479
Amen.

326
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,146
Good day, lady.

327
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,708
Good day, lady.

328
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:29,375
Good day.

329
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:33,958
Good day lady.

330
00:24:43,021 --> 00:24:44,305
Yesterday many of you see

331
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,875
one of your colleague present me with a nolos.

332
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,313
I accepted the gift.

333
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:54,167
And today I wish to make him a gift of my own return.

334
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,292
This is for you.

335
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,521
It is the blood of my cycle.

336
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,146
Orestes you...

337
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,583
you say you have found harmony in me.

338
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:32,882
Well I am suggesting that you look elsewhere

339
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:35,625
because I think there is a little harmony or

340
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,542
or beauty in that.

341
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,125
Do you agree?

342
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,771
Yesterday we were discussing the Apollonius cone.

343
00:25:56,979 --> 00:26:00,521
We speak of the circle, the ellipse, parabola.

344
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:03,333
- Today we see the hyperbola. - Lady!

345
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,354
Forgive me, Lady.

346
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:10,313
Olimpios requires your present urgently to the serapeum.

347
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:12,917
You as well.

348
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:30,833
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

349
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:32,917
Thank you, Lord.

350
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:37,917
Are we to enjoy them for speaking us the faith

351
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:41,979
the custom the people until recently were coming out roles?

352
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:44,063
- What happened? - It's dispicable!

353
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,083
Christians have gathered in the agora.

354
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:49,167
They are mocking the gods.

355
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,771
We must put end to these insults!

356
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,333
They may not fear him,

357
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:56,563
but they will fear our swords!

358
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:01,354
Wait!

359
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:02,604
Wait!

360
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,479
What is it you are going to do?

361
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,188
Are you going to attack them?

362
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,042
Are you going to stain your hands with blood for an insult?

363
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:15,625
The gods! An insult to the gods!

364
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:17,420
If you think it so outrate,

365
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:18,958
just go and announce the act before the prefect.

366
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,627
One might seem that you protecting them.

367
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:24,752
I am try to protect our disciples.

368
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,252
You are inciting them to be wild murderers.

369
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:32,148
Theon, as director, you have the last word.

370
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:41,002
The insult must to be answered.

371
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,688
Those Jews among you can do as you pleased,

372
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:45,169
this is not your battle.

373
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:46,101
As for you, Christians,

374
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,877
you would do well to join those of your own faith.

375
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,627
You will not caused my disciples out of this house!

376
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:55,481
- Glory to Serapis! - All for the gods!

377
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,981
Wait for my command!

378
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:00,898
No one would suspect us until we have surrounded.

379
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:05,481
These swords are for the slaves! Slaves

380
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,669
Slaves are also summoned!

381
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,460
Davus, go back.

382
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,127
No. Go back.

383
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:16,210
Kill the Christians!

384
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:25,794
Glory to Serapis!

385
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,148
Let us listen to her now!

386
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:52,773
Do you hear her complain?

387
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,335
No!

388
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:57,981
This one has lost her voice too!

389
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:04,231
Their mouths do not speak,

390
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:06,210
their eyes do not see,

391
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:08,294
their nose does not smell.

392
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:13,502
Yet still a pagan come here they kneel before them!

393
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:19,752
What madness is this?

394
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,190
By the gods!

395
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:30,273
Medoro!

396
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:32,877
Take care of your master! Protect him..!

397
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,877
God is one!

398
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,190
Death for the heathens!

399
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,440
You! What are you looking at? Get them! fight!

400
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:06,315
Fight!

401
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:09,856
Are you deaf? I said fight

402
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:25,585
I am a Christian!

403
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,481
I am a Christian!

404
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:34,960
I am a Christian!

405
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:45,273
- What is Christ? - Christ is one!

406
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:47,773
Death to the heathens!

407
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:50,169
God is one!

408
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:56,419
No! No!

409
00:31:57,773 --> 00:32:01,210
The entrance, we must defend the entrance!

410
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,502
What's happening?

411
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,210
Our men might be sent by the christians!

412
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:24,752
Father!

413
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:28,606
It's all right. It's all right.

414
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:32,460
What happened?

415
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,960
It was his slave.

416
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:40,585
Davus, give me some cloth and some water, quickly.

417
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:42,669
Father ...

418
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:49,231
Synesius, we must get out of here.

419
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,690
Hold him still.

420
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:06,627
Parabolans are coming!

421
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:23,606
God is with us!

422
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,044
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

423
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:29,856
- Close the gate! - No, no, our men are still out there!

424
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,940
May the gods protect them.

425
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:34,023
Close the gate. I say!

426
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:01,963
Do not kill him! We will keep him a hostage,

427
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,231
like the others. Did you hear that everyone?

428
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,835
Any Christian that you catch

429
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,294
is now a hostage.

430
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,731
Now, take our wounded to the temple and Christians

431
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,483
down into the cellars.

432
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,419
Anyone with a good eye and a good aim up on the walls.

433
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:17,460
Olinpios.

434
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:19,648
This one is a Christian.

435
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:21,940
Yes, and those three as well.

436
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,705
If they are Christians, they will  go down to the cellars.

437
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:26,226
Olimpios...

438
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,700
if you are going imprison my brothers,

439
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,648
you are going to imprison me with them.

440
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,773
If it is necessary, I will do that.

441
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,481
If anyone,

442
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:38,398
anyone,

443
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:43,606
dare lay a finger on one of my brothers,

444
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:47,148
I swear I will run him through.

445
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:50,921
Look!

446
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,108
Look at this!

447
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:02,067
Orestes.

448
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:05,088
Thank you.

449
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,254
Since when there is

450
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:25,713
so many Christians?

451
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:28,317
We will have to negotiate.

452
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:01,254
What are we waiting for?

453
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:03,004
What can we expect from a Christian emperor

454
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:04,879
except we put up the sword

455
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:08,421
I have settled for still being alive when it's worth to lives.

456
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,775
Care we'll do.

457
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,213
No one should leave the group, please.

458
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:17,067
Are they going to pray all night?

459
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,046
Davus.

460
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,608
Stay here.

461
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,171
It's safe here.

462
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:34,463
Just stay here would be best.

463
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,733
Synesius! What are you doing?

464
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:25,504
Lady, sister and mother,

465
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:28,421
May God bless you and protect you.

466
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:51,546
Move back!

467
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:53,733
Slave end up eating this

468
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,754
Slaves get to the back!

469
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,671
The three one come out

470
00:39:00,192 --> 00:39:01,858
It's a disaster.

471
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:03,838
Father, when will you leave the dice.

472
00:39:05,192 --> 00:39:06,963
You have been seen today?

473
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,942
- No. - No?

474
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,275
Let's have a look.

475
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,025
Promise me, my child,

476
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:20,296
when I'm gone. You won't remember this foolish old man.

477
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,754
I promise.

478
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:26,442
Remember me as I was before.

479
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:31,338
before when I could still think and

480
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:36,338
I work with you,

481
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:39,775
and I listened to you.

482
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:43,629
How could I've been so wrong?

483
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:47,692
See. You here, locked up here because of me. ..

484
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,254
Father, please.

485
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:52,067
I wanted you to be free.

486
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:01,754
I am free.

487
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:06,546
Hey Christians

488
00:40:07,692 --> 00:40:08,838
Christians!

489
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:12,588
What's that confindent for the God of yours doing now?

490
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:15,608
Coffins for you, scum!

491
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:37,483
So, tell me.

492
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:40,088
Where are the Gods now?

493
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:42,796
Where are they?

494
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,858
- Might as well look for others - Other?

495
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:50,192
Which one? The God of the Christians, perhaps?

496
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:52,379
Such boldness!

497
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:59,567
What do you think, Lady? You are so bold

498
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:06,338
Get the fire out.

499
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,463
You are indeed bold.

500
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,588
Very bold.

501
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:30,296
I've been thinking about something you said to me.

502
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:31,546
Me?

503
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:34,983
The day that you criticize the heavenly mechanism

504
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:39,704
and you called it whimsical.

505
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:41,129
Yes, although..

506
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:42,692
actually

507
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:44,775
I was criticizing Ptolemy

508
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:48,004
for complicating everything with epicycles.

509
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,650
But I do not know. Perhaps, just simple minded.

510
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:52,796
No.

511
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,233
The heavens

512
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,004
should be simple.

513
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,588
So am I right or..?

514
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:08,108
What if ...

515
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,609
what if there were a simpler explanation

516
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,942
for the wanderers

517
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:16,754
There is.

518
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:21,442
But it's so absurd, so old

519
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:24,150
that no one gives it any credit.

520
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,608
What theory is that?

521
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:27,171
Do you speak Aristarchus

522
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,879
Aristarchus maintained

523
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:31,754
that the earth moves.

524
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:35,817
The strange behavior of the wanderers

525
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:38,942
was nothing more than an optical illusion

526
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:42,067
caused by our movement

527
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:45,504
in combination with us around the sun.

528
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,046
- A heliocentric model. - That's right.

529
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,129
The sun would be in the center,

530
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,358
as Memphis dignity deals King of the stars.

531
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:57,928
- And make us just..  - His work was lost

532
00:42:57,929 --> 00:42:58,733
be another wanderer.

533
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:01,129
in the fire that destroyed the Mother Library.

534
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:06,129
This is why we have to take great care of this place.

535
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:08,167
Our library

536
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:11,858
is all that remains of wisdom of men.

537
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:14,775
But every time you drop an object ...

538
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:18,108
Who speaks?

539
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:20,713
Forgive me mistress.

540
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,504
I was listening.

541
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,692
Speak up, Davus.

542
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,504
If the earth is moving,

543
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,733
every time you drop an object,

544
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:36,129
it would fall further behind.

545
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,192
And the wind would always blow against us.

546
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:43,317
And the birds would lose their way in flight.

547
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:45,296
I told you

548
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:48,942
Aristarchus hypothesis make no sense at all.

549
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:54,254
I feel that what you just said can be refuted.

550
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,733
But right now I do not know how.

551
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:27,275
Make way for the prefect!

552
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:29,150
Make way!

553
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:32,171
Make way for the prefect!

554
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:33,942
Make way!

555
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,338
Listen everyone!

556
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:55,921
Prepare to hear and obey the verdict of our emperor

557
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,483
I, Flavius Theodosius Augustus

558
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:06,025
emperor and supreme Head of the provinces of the Orions,

559
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:07,900
having been informed

560
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:11,338
of the event notice recently in the place in city Alexandria,

561
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,838
hereby declare and command

562
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:16,858
let the insurgents shall be protected and free...

563
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,838
In exchange for my generosity,

564
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:30,963
the insurgents will abandon

565
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:34,463
the Serapeum and the Library immediately

566
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,692
allowing the Christians to enter

567
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:39,358
and dispose of the promsis

568
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,483
whatever you like.

569
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:52,692
What are we expect? They destroy everything!

570
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:56,233
Pagans will leave by the stable!

571
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:57,171
The Books.

572
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,192
From there you will be escorted to your home.

573
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:03,004
Obey within instance!

574
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:13,838
Send half a regiment to the other side.

575
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,338
Send the rest later.

576
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:17,796
Yes, sir.

577
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:20,817
Prefect.

578
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:23,213
We won't be able to contain this muff for long.

579
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:27,483
On the cross! On the cross!

580
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:39,775
Let the lesser works!

581
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:43,108
- What are the lesser works? - Just take important ones!

582
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:49,983
The soldiers are retreating!

583
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:15,088
Slave

584
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:17,275
- Have you seen my mistress? - Just get over here and help!

585
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:28,421
- We can not carry so many! - We need more help.

586
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:34,161
Please go and get my father out of here.

587
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:35,296
Get him out of here now.

588
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:44,254
Slave

589
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:46,754
Come on! Go, go!

590
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:49,775
Come on, quickly!

591
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:55,921
Hypatia and her students are still in the atrium.

592
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:57,171
Are they out of their minds?

593
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:01,025
If that's what they want, let them burn.

594
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:02,796
Come on!

595
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,254
Quickly!

596
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:17,483
Lady.

597
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:20,921
Where have you been? Pick up that sack.

598
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:23,629
- Lady We have to go. - Pick up the sack

599
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:29,150
Why slaves never around when you need it.

600
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:33,421
- I was ... - Move move you feet, quickly!

601
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:35,400
Idiot!

602
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:55,400
Run!

603
00:48:57,796 --> 00:48:59,983
Come on! There's no time!

604
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,838
Lady!

605
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,963
We gotta go. You have to leave them.

606
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:16,650
God is one!

607
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,192
Hurry!

608
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:41,233
Davus!

609
00:49:41,963 --> 00:49:43,629
Where are you going?

610
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:46,311
- We have to go! - Davus, where are you going?

611
00:49:46,311 --> 00:49:48,421
If he want to die for our Gods, let him.

612
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:50,088
Davus, no, please do not do this.

613
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:51,650
- Come on! - Davus!

614
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:53,317
- Davus, no! - Come on!

615
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,275
By the cross

616
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:23,004
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

617
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:40,817
Slave

618
00:51:45,504 --> 00:51:46,754
Davus!

619
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,150
Davus!

620
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,692
Davus the slave!

621
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,713
Help me with this!

622
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,796
Help!

623
00:51:58,213 --> 00:52:02,171
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

624
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:07,483
Pagan scum!

625
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,650
The most of wound is history.

626
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:03,712
I know.

627
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:08,608
I know.

628
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:41,733
Davus.

629
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,442
Davus!

630
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:32,567
You are free.

631
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:35,275
Go.

632
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:37,254
Go.

633
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:02,254
From now on, in Alexandria

634
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:06,108
only Christian and Jewish worship should be permitted.

635
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:07,775
Pagan sacrifices,

636
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:11,108
worship of pagan symbols

637
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:14,754
and visits to pagan temples should no longer be allowed.

638
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:19,442
If anyone commits such acts or dare look at the statues

639
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:24,129
of their ancient gods, he shall be punished without mercy.

640
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:40,900
After taking the library, many pagans were converted...

641
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,025
Hipatia continued teaching and researching,...

642
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:46,108
...while his former students held...

643
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:49,233
...important positions in the social elite.

644
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:52,358
The empire was split in two forever.

645
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:55,483
Many Christians saw this as a sign of the end of the world...

646
00:58:55,483 --> 00:58:57,567
...and decided to prepare by practicing a more holy life.

647
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,254
The order of "Parabolanos" Monks was charged to go...

648
00:59:02,254 --> 00:59:04,858
...through the streets and watch for Christian morality...

649
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:11,212
...now uneven by the presence of the Jews.

650
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:33,817
Damn Jews!

651
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,275
Damn Jews!

652
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:44,442
They're just a bunch of good-for-nothing thugs, bad animals.

653
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,358
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

654
01:01:48,817 --> 01:01:51,212
Let Bishop Cyril speaks his own defense.

655
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,025
Prefect

656
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:56,004
our blessed parabolans,

657
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,025
Hung he has just called

658
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,212
piece of burden,

659
01:02:01,733 --> 01:02:04,650
devote themselves truly enough to carrying burdens

660
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:07,775
crippled, sick,the lever ...

661
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:09,233
And stones!

662
01:02:09,442 --> 01:02:11,108
Prefect, they can carry stones.

663
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:13,214
And now they burst into the theater

664
01:02:13,214 --> 01:02:16,004
and they stoned us knowing we'll do nothing to defend ourselves,

665
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,086
because it is the Sabbath!

666
01:02:19,129 --> 01:02:21,004
On the Sabbath you should honor God

667
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:23,921
in your synagogues instead of stuffing yourself

668
01:02:24,129 --> 01:02:25,692
with sweet set of the theater.

669
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:28,296
That is why the stones fell upon you.

670
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:33,733
Prefect, you hear that? Now he's threatening us. This is too much

671
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:37,516
Friends, there are more things that unite us than divide us.

672
01:02:37,516 --> 01:02:39,386
We are brothers! We are all brothers

673
01:02:39,858 --> 01:02:43,696
Where would you Christians be without the Jews?

674
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:44,858
Jesus was a Jew!

675
01:02:44,858 --> 01:02:47,150
Jesus was a Jew!

676
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,379
There is something I find

677
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:22,462
stubbing what you told me.

678
01:03:22,775 --> 01:03:24,858
- What? - Well

679
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:29,650
Well, why Cyril begin cleaning up the city?

680
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:32,046
Is he not satisfied with what he already has?

681
01:03:32,254 --> 01:03:34,337
I think he's just trying to frighten the Jews.

682
01:03:34,546 --> 01:03:36,317
But why say it in front of you

683
01:03:36,837 --> 01:03:40,796
What if really he was addressing.. you and not them?

684
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:44,546
Me? Why? I'm as Christian as he is.

685
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,692
Yes, but you forget

686
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,817
that many of us from your circle are not.

687
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,900
A full sail, prefect.

688
01:03:52,983 --> 01:03:54,025
Let's go.

689
01:03:56,942 --> 01:03:59,546
- Aspasius, are you ready? - Yes, mistress.

690
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,817
I would like you to take the sack and climb to top the mast.

691
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,379
And now, Lady,

692
01:04:20,587 --> 01:04:23,400
will you finally tell me what the point of all these is?

693
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,733
When Aspasius drop the sack,

694
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:29,025
the boat will be moving forward.

695
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,587
Therefore, the sack

696
01:04:30,796 --> 01:04:33,504
not fall at the foot of the mast,

697
01:04:33,712 --> 01:04:37,879
but will fall further back. I wouly say about ...

698
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:43,087
about here.

699
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:45,379
And what's so special about that?

700
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,046
- Yes! - But You're wrong!

701
01:05:02,254 --> 01:05:05,907
Yes, but this is definitive prove. It's definitive.

702
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:10,171
The sack behaved as if the boat was stationary.

703
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:12,046
What does that mean?

704
01:05:13,712 --> 01:05:15,171
I don't know.

705
01:05:16,108 --> 01:05:18,608
But the same principle can be applied to the Earth.

706
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:23,608
It could be moving around the sun without us realizing.

707
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:27,671
- Aristarchus. - Exactly.

708
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:32,462
Why do you so mean to yourself for that, Lady?

709
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:35,275
Ptolemy is not perfect,

710
01:05:36,004 --> 01:05:37,046
but it works.

711
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:39,337
Orestes, but you are the one who

712
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:43,712
A few years ago you weren't so pragmatic, prefect.

713
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,671
A few years ago I spoke first and thought later.

714
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,192
I have Cepheus third.

715
01:06:11,108 --> 01:06:12,254
37.

716
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:14,337
48.

717
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:20,900
Venus and Mars share house in Aquarius.

718
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:29,337
My father would have celebrated such a conjunction with a good wine.

719
01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:33,296
- The stars will not fall. - Really?

720
01:06:33,817 --> 01:06:36,212
No, because they are fixed to the lid of the chest.

721
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:39,754
The lid opens two hearts and then Jesus will appear.

722
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:42,567
What chest for you talking about?

723
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:47,567
Do not you know that the universe is a gigantic chest?

724
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:52,150
Heaven is the lid on top and the Earth grounded.

725
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:56,525
They haven't told this fool that the Earth is round!

726
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,400
The Earth is flat.

727
01:06:59,025 --> 01:07:00,692
Your head is flat.

728
01:07:01,108 --> 01:07:02,462
Read the Scriptures!

729
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:04,754
If the earth is round,

730
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:07,879
why don't the people live on the bottom fall off?

731
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:12,254
What about the ones on the sides?

732
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:14,442
Why don't they slide off?

733
01:07:16,317 --> 01:07:17,879
Think about it.

734
01:07:19,754 --> 01:07:21,004
Davus knows.

735
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:22,567
Hi Brother.

736
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:24,025
What do you say?

737
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:27,150
Is the earth flat or round?

738
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:32,462
Only God knows these things.

739
01:07:38,192 --> 01:07:39,337
Leave them on the ground!

740
01:07:39,546 --> 01:07:42,077
Leave them on the ground! It is where they belong!

741
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:44,233
Lady, you must not disheart.

742
01:07:44,962 --> 01:07:47,046
Today on the boat you make great progress.

743
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:51,004
Why do the wanderers vary that brightness

744
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:53,504
so unexpectedly?

745
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:56,733
And what is worse,

746
01:07:57,358 --> 01:07:58,921
why does the sun...

747
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:03,087
why does it change size from summer to winter?

748
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:07,879
Perhaps because sometimes it is nearer

749
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:09,546
and other times it is farther away?

750
01:08:11,108 --> 01:08:12,046
But Aspasius,

751
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,337
watch.

752
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:18,608
According to Aristarchus, the sun must be

753
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:20,379
at the center of everything.

754
01:08:21,837 --> 01:08:23,608
With us, the Earth,

755
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:26,837
traveling in a circle around it.

756
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:32,046
Therefore, and this is the key

757
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:36,629
We are always at exactly

758
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:42,462
the same ...distance.

759
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,900
Now if, as what you just said, we accept the changes in distance,

760
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:47,879
then we will force to add

761
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,212
an epicycle to the Earth orbit.

762
01:08:51,317 --> 01:08:55,379
So it's going to be nearer then it's going to be farther away.

763
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:59,025
But now we fall in the same trap as Ptolemy.

764
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:00,900
- Circles upon circles. - Exactly!

765
01:09:02,358 --> 01:09:05,587
So I just don't know how to resolve this conflict.

766
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:13,087
Let me know you think we can do this

767
01:09:16,004 --> 01:09:18,817
Displace the sun from the center. Well,

768
01:09:19,337 --> 01:09:21,108
not to have a center

769
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:23,296
breaks my heart, Aspasius.

770
01:09:25,692 --> 01:09:28,087
So, tell me what do I do?

771
01:09:30,275 --> 01:09:32,046
Rest, lady.

772
01:09:44,962 --> 01:09:46,837
Parabolans!

773
01:09:47,358 --> 01:09:49,650
- Parabolans! - What happens?

774
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:53,087
Parabolans, quick! Help!

775
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,067
San Alejandro is on fire!

776
01:09:55,587 --> 01:09:56,733
It is a fire.

777
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,546
Come on!

778
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:07,150
Gather water! Get the bucket! Take this!

779
01:10:08,087 --> 01:10:09,962
- Quick! - Go! Go!

780
01:10:11,525 --> 01:10:12,983
Quick!

781
01:10:16,108 --> 01:10:17,983
Hurry up! Move, move!

782
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:26,317
Parabolans!

783
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:29,025
Parabolans!

784
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:30,900
Parabolans, quick!

785
01:10:33,504 --> 01:10:35,067
Where's the fire?

786
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:39,233
Over there! Over there!

787
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:49,233
Jews! It's a trap.

788
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:50,900
It's a trap!

789
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:15,275
Christians all

790
01:12:16,421 --> 01:12:18,817
last night was the night deplorable.

791
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:22,254
Now I say to you,

792
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:27,254
grave no longer for our dead brothers.

793
01:12:28,296 --> 01:12:29,858
Weep not.

794
01:12:33,608 --> 01:12:35,796
Shed you tears for the others,

795
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:38,817
for they are executioners.

796
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:50,692
Yes, yes.

797
01:12:50,796 --> 01:12:53,817
Weep for them, for those who have done this,

798
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:56,212
they know none of God,

799
01:12:56,525 --> 01:12:58,817
none of love, none of pity.

800
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,108
They know not.

801
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:07,065
Because in this day who repeated the world of Scriptures

802
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:08,817
with no understanding at all.

803
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:13,400
It is they who saw only a man

804
01:13:13,504 --> 01:13:16,421
when the Son of God was standing in the front of them.

805
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:19,337
And it is they who in their blindness

806
01:13:19,337 --> 01:13:21,942
mocked Him and crucified him.

807
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:32,050
Yes, weep! Weep! Weep for the Jews,

808
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,546
those evil butchers of our Lord.

809
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:38,504
Because God ...

810
01:13:39,858 --> 01:13:43,504
God has already condemned them.

811
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:45,067
It is God's will..

812
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,462
that they live as slaves,

813
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,317
cursed and exiled until the end of time.

814
01:13:51,629 --> 01:13:53,712
Cursed and exiled!

815
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:57,046
Cursed and exiled!

816
01:13:59,754 --> 01:14:02,254
Cursed and exiled!

817
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,087
Lady, do not stop, Lady.

818
01:15:17,254 --> 01:15:19,950
Now all the Jews want to retaliate!

819
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,712
I'm afraid you do not understand what is really happening.

820
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,462
When this is over, there would be no more Jews in Alexandria.

821
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,733
I am sorry to burst in like this.

822
01:15:36,942 --> 01:15:39,650
Lady, you should not risk coming here.

823
01:15:39,858 --> 01:15:41,525
Where are the troops?

824
01:15:43,087 --> 01:15:45,171
Why are there no more soldiers on the streets?

825
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:48,608
No army can contain entire city in that frenzy.

826
01:15:51,108 --> 01:15:54,650
He's calling for the annihilation of women and children

827
01:15:55,587 --> 01:15:56,733
A bishop!

828
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:59,337
- A Christian! - Then lock him up.

829
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:06,317
Prefect, you should have him arrested.

830
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:11,733
It's not so easy.

831
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:17,358
Lady, Cyril knows we both share the same faith.

832
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:23,087
That place our prefect in the very awkward position.

833
01:16:23,817 --> 01:16:25,483
If he defends the Jews,

834
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,671
half the city will rise against this government.

835
01:16:29,754 --> 01:16:30,796
I see.

836
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,796
If you choose to do nothing though,

837
01:16:36,212 --> 01:16:40,342
I believe Cyril will continue to do the same thing

838
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:45,867
over and over again until there is no one left in this city,

839
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:48,504
no people for this government to govern.

840
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:03,504
How naive with me.

841
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:09,546
How naive with me to think with a final change.

842
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:54,233
Jews out!

843
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,462
First they kill them

844
01:18:17,879 --> 01:18:19,546
and they buried them.

845
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,608
The Bishop of Cyrene.

846
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:36,733
- What is he doing here? - I'll find out.

847
01:18:39,337 --> 01:18:41,837
It's my little library of Alexandria.

848
01:18:46,629 --> 01:18:48,504
This is where I teach children.

849
01:18:51,212 --> 01:18:52,775
An Apollonius cone.

850
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:56,317
Yes, I built it to teach them about the four curves.

851
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:57,879
Circle,

852
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:00,692
the ellipse ...

853
01:19:03,817 --> 01:19:05,379
Orestes should be here by now.

854
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:06,733
The parabole

855
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:09,129
and hyperbola.

856
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,462
It's truly beautiful.

857
01:19:13,608 --> 01:19:16,421
You know I often look at it and wonder

858
01:19:16,525 --> 01:19:18,504
why the circle co axis

859
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,483
is such impure shapes.

860
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:26,421
What I get to sit here and listen to you again

861
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:28,087
I bored you.

862
01:19:28,608 --> 01:19:30,542
It's been a long time since I've done anything

863
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:32,046
but beat my head against system.

864
01:19:33,192 --> 01:19:35,900
And how they're more important matters a hand.

865
01:19:36,108 --> 01:19:37,046
Forgive me.

866
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:52,150
Two Christians in the hands of a pagan.

867
01:19:52,358 --> 01:19:53,817
It's an outrage!

868
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:02,671
It's an outrage.

869
01:20:24,025 --> 01:20:27,671
- How many? - I do not know, but it will stink.

870
01:20:34,233 --> 01:20:35,483
Ammonius

871
01:20:36,942 --> 01:20:38,504
Does God speak with you?

872
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:41,421
All the time.

873
01:20:42,775 --> 01:20:46,108
Ammonius this, Ammonius that. Ammonius...

874
01:20:47,046 --> 01:20:48,712
Today he spoke to me

875
01:20:48,817 --> 01:20:52,150
so quickly that I had to ask him slow down

876
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,108
Tell me something.

877
01:20:57,671 --> 01:20:59,129
Do you ever think we have mistaken?

878
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,087
Why?

879
01:21:09,025 --> 01:21:10,587
I was forgiven,

880
01:21:13,712 --> 01:21:16,108
But now, I can not forgive.

881
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:18,921
Forgive?

882
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,796
Who?

883
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,296
The Jews?

884
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,025
Jesus pared them on the cross.

885
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:33,504
Jesus was God

886
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:36,837
And only he can show such clemency.

887
01:21:37,462 --> 01:21:40,379
How dare you to compare yourself to God?

888
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:45,692
Brother.

889
01:21:49,233 --> 01:21:51,004
You're still alive.

890
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,400
Why?

891
01:21:54,025 --> 01:21:55,171
Because it was

892
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:57,879
his will save us from the stones.

893
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:03,608
God wants us here, doing what we do.

894
01:22:04,233 --> 01:22:06,317
Don't you believe in that anymore?

895
01:22:23,296 --> 01:22:24,337
My Lord ...

896
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:32,775
Cyril is very proud man.

897
01:22:33,712 --> 01:22:36,436
Agree to meet but will not discuss the Jews,

898
01:22:36,437 --> 01:22:37,879
only discuss peace.

899
01:22:40,067 --> 01:22:41,108
Peace?

900
01:22:41,317 --> 01:22:45,067
My suggestion, as your humble adviser in this affair,

901
01:22:45,275 --> 01:22:47,046
is for you to accept.

902
01:22:47,983 --> 01:22:49,337
Let peace be for most.

903
01:22:51,317 --> 01:22:53,712
- Lady, what do you think? - Well... I ...

904
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,629
I don't think it is very encouraging.

905
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,442
Why would he want to come and see Orestes

906
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:02,254
- without concrete proposals? - There's something else

907
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:05,275
He want come to you.

908
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:08,400
Demands you meets in the Library

909
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:09,962
During the Sunday's service.

910
01:23:10,171 --> 01:23:12,567
In the Library? Why?

911
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:14,995
Only Christians have been permitted

912
01:23:14,996 --> 01:23:16,837
to entered there since it's tombed.

913
01:23:17,046 --> 01:23:19,129
It is a provocation!

914
01:23:22,254 --> 01:23:23,817
Allow me to suggest.

915
01:23:24,962 --> 01:23:27,254
If you consider your presence

916
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:28,712
so essential

917
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:30,900
Why not let yourself be baptized?

918
01:23:34,129 --> 01:23:35,796
The majority of us here, beginning

919
01:23:36,004 --> 01:23:38,712
with our prefect, have accepted Christ.

920
01:23:39,129 --> 01:23:40,900
Why not the rest of you?

921
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:44,129
It's only a matter of time and you know it!

922
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,483
Really?

923
01:23:46,733 --> 01:23:48,817
Is it only a matter of time?

924
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,317
Well, excuse me,

925
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:53,296
Honorable Member but as far as I'm away..

926
01:23:53,504 --> 01:23:55,692
Your God has not yet proved

927
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,129
Be more just or more mercyful than their predecessors.

928
01:23:59,337 --> 01:23:59,962
Lady.

929
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:03,921
Is it really just a matter of time before I accept your faith?

930
01:24:04,962 --> 01:24:06,421
Why, then,

931
01:24:06,942 --> 01:24:08,608
Should this assembly

932
01:24:09,233 --> 01:24:12,671
accept the consult of someone who admittedly

933
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,004
believes in absolutely nothing?

934
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:20,067
I believe in philosophy.

935
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,546
Philosophy.

936
01:24:25,275 --> 01:24:27,046
Just what we need

937
01:24:27,358 --> 01:24:29,025
in times like this.

938
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:31,421
Enough!

939
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:44,754
All these years I've been studying.

940
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:49,129
Absolutely no life for my own,

941
01:24:49,858 --> 01:24:51,629
and I wonder

942
01:24:54,025 --> 01:24:57,671
- What was the point  - Forget about what was said today.

943
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,983
Is this all life holds for me?

944
01:25:05,275 --> 01:25:06,525
What else?

945
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:10,171
I doubt anyone can see you

946
01:25:10,483 --> 01:25:11,837
as a devoted wife

947
01:25:12,046 --> 01:25:13,087
and mother.

948
01:25:13,921 --> 01:25:15,067
I think ...

949
01:25:15,692 --> 01:25:19,119
I think everyone in the city know the history of the handkerchief.

950
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:24,650
So ...

951
01:25:29,442 --> 01:25:31,212
My father loved woman.

952
01:25:31,942 --> 01:25:33,192
Even he ...

953
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:36,715
Who've ever loved?

954
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:41,475
Except you,

955
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:42,621
Lebanons.

956
01:25:54,392 --> 01:25:55,850
If I could just...

957
01:25:59,704 --> 01:26:01,371
just unravel this ...

958
01:26:01,497 --> 01:26:03,059
Just a little bit more.

959
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:11,319
And just get a little closer to the answer, then

960
01:26:11,944 --> 01:26:13,610
then I would...

961
01:26:15,694 --> 01:26:18,090
Then I would go to my grave, a happy women.

962
01:26:20,381 --> 01:26:21,527
Why?

963
01:26:22,256 --> 01:26:24,131
Why does that mean so much to you?

964
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:28,402
Right now,

965
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:33,506
this every second, whole earth could be moving

966
01:26:33,715 --> 01:26:35,798
and no one realized it.

967
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:38,506
Except you and me

968
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:41,006
Believe me Lady, it's best that no one does.

969
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,902
Do you really not think it important?

970
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:46,995
I do not understand why

971
01:26:46,996 --> 01:26:48,610
you insist on moving the ground we walk on.

972
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,006
You saw of yourself what happened on the boat.

973
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:54,131
Yes I did,But that does not mean this sailing on the earth moves.

974
01:26:55,173 --> 01:26:56,527
What if it does

975
01:26:57,152 --> 01:26:59,235
Hypatia, look around you.

976
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,798
Death

977
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:02,256
Horror

978
01:27:02,465 --> 01:27:03,819
Destruction.

979
01:27:03,923 --> 01:27:06,735
If the stars move in a Circle

980
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,756
Why would they share their perfection with us

981
01:27:12,881 --> 01:27:14,340
So we don't move.

982
01:27:14,652 --> 01:27:16,006
In a circle.

983
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:17,777
We do not move ...

984
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:22,881
for a circle.

985
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:26,423
We do not move in circles.

986
01:27:35,694 --> 01:27:37,152
Ever since Plato,

987
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,110
All of them: Aristarchus Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

988
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:45,173
They have all... tried reconcile their observations

989
01:27:45,381 --> 01:27:47,256
with circular orbits.

990
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:49,860
But What if other shapes  hidden in the heavens

991
01:27:50,173 --> 01:27:51,840
Another shapes?

992
01:27:52,152 --> 01:27:53,928
Lady, There is no purer than the circle,

993
01:27:53,929 --> 01:27:55,173
you taught us that.

994
01:27:55,381 --> 01:27:58,402
I know, but suppose, just suppose

995
01:27:58,610 --> 01:27:59,756
That the purity of the circle

996
01:27:59,965 --> 01:28:03,715
has blinded us from seeing anything beyond it.

997
01:28:04,027 --> 01:28:06,006
In the same way that glared sun blind us from actually seeing

998
01:28:06,006 --> 01:28:07,777
the stars.

999
01:28:08,298 --> 01:28:09,965
I must begin all over with

1000
01:28:10,173 --> 01:28:12,569
with new eyes. I must...

1001
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:16,423
I must rethink everything.

1002
01:28:17,048 --> 01:28:17,985
Everything.

1003
01:28:31,423 --> 01:28:34,652
Reading from the first letter Paul to Timothy.

1004
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:38,819
I desired therefore that everywhere

1005
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:42,569
men should lift up their holy hand in prayer

1006
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:46,319
Without anger or disputing.

1007
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,735
In like manner I desire women to

1008
01:28:52,777 --> 01:28:54,340
dress modestly,

1009
01:28:55,381 --> 01:28:58,402
decency and propriety

1010
01:28:58,506 --> 01:29:00,069
not with braided hair

1011
01:29:01,631 --> 01:29:04,340
or gold or pearls

1012
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:06,423
or expensive clothes.

1013
01:29:08,298 --> 01:29:11,006
- But with good deeds. - Why is he reading this passage?

1014
01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:12,681
I do not know, prefect.

1015
01:29:12,682 --> 01:29:14,965
I assure you it's not the one we agreed upon.

1016
01:29:15,902 --> 01:29:18,090
Let the woman learn

1017
01:29:18,298 --> 01:29:21,631
in quietness and in full submission, I do not permit a woman

1018
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,277
to teach, or to have authority over a man.

1019
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,444
But to be

1020
01:29:30,173 --> 01:29:31,735
in Silent

1021
01:29:38,402 --> 01:29:40,381
This is the word of God!

1022
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:41,944
Amen.

1023
01:29:42,569 --> 01:29:43,610
Amen.

1024
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:47,152
Jesus himself

1025
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:49,860
knew this when he

1026
01:29:50,069 --> 01:29:53,298
he entrusted his holy legacy to twelve men.

1027
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:55,381
Men.

1028
01:29:55,902 --> 01:29:57,777
Not a woman among them.

1029
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,381
And yet

1030
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:04,444
I know some in Alexandria

1031
01:30:04,652 --> 01:30:07,256
they admire and even trust in words

1032
01:30:07,465 --> 01:30:08,819
of a woman.

1033
01:30:09,235 --> 01:30:11,110
The philosopher Hypatia.

1034
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,860
A woman who declare,

1035
01:30:14,965 --> 01:30:17,673
in public, her ungodliness.

1036
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:23,194
A witch!

1037
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,985
Dignitaries,

1038
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:33,402
It is the time for you all to reconcile yourself with Christ.

1039
01:30:44,235 --> 01:30:46,110
This is the word of God.

1040
01:30:48,923 --> 01:30:51,735
Kneel before it and embrace its truth.

1041
01:31:34,444 --> 01:31:35,485
Kneel.

1042
01:31:37,048 --> 01:31:38,819
Is he not going to kneel?

1043
01:31:42,465 --> 01:31:44,340
Is he not going to kneel?

1044
01:31:52,985 --> 01:31:54,131
Kneel!

1045
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,110
Kneel!

1046
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,715
Sinner

1047
01:32:15,485 --> 01:32:17,048
I am a Christian

1048
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:19,652
- I am a Christian! - No you are not!

1049
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,152
I'm as Christian as you are

1050
01:32:22,673 --> 01:32:25,173
Make way for the prefect!

1051
01:32:26,006 --> 01:32:27,152
Make way!

1052
01:32:38,402 --> 01:32:40,485
I am a baptized Christian!

1053
01:32:41,215 --> 01:32:43,090
I am a baptized Christian!

1054
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,235
I'll kill you.

1055
01:32:54,548 --> 01:32:55,902
I'm as Christian as you

1056
01:32:57,048 --> 01:32:58,819
I'm as Christian as you are

1057
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:46,527
How could such a thing be possible?

1058
01:33:47,256 --> 01:33:49,027
The culprit has been executed .

1059
01:33:49,756 --> 01:33:51,719
I would like you to take me to the prefect immediately.

1060
01:33:51,771 --> 01:33:53,402
Lady, he himself gave the order

1061
01:33:53,506 --> 01:33:56,527
for you to be confined to the house until further notice.

1062
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:59,965
At the moment your presence on the street is not advisable

1063
01:34:01,423 --> 01:34:02,569
For what reason?

1064
01:34:05,798 --> 01:34:08,819
Cyril make serious accusation against you.

1065
01:34:11,423 --> 01:34:12,465
And then. ..

1066
01:34:13,298 --> 01:34:15,277
What is he accused me of?

1067
01:34:16,006 --> 01:34:17,465
Ungodliness  .....

1068
01:34:18,506 --> 01:34:19,860
and witchcraft.

1069
01:34:25,798 --> 01:34:26,944
I see.

1070
01:34:38,819 --> 01:34:40,590
Is something bothering you, Lady?

1071
01:34:41,735 --> 01:34:42,777
No.

1072
01:34:46,631 --> 01:34:48,819
Why don't you tell me what's worrying you.

1073
01:35:12,048 --> 01:35:13,819
Prefect, why don't you bite on it.

1074
01:35:16,215 --> 01:35:17,360
Speak.

1075
01:35:17,465 --> 01:35:19,652
The Bishop of Cyrene want to see you.

1076
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:23,715
Leave, all of you.

1077
01:35:23,923 --> 01:35:25,485
Prefect, the wound is still not ...

1078
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:27,881
Get out. Get out!

1079
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:34,548
All of you! Out!

1080
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,694
Without went well.

1081
01:35:47,673 --> 01:35:50,069
You think I had a part in this?

1082
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:52,673
But I show my face here if I want to betray you?

1083
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:56,215
- Are you blind?  - Yes, I was blind.

1084
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:58,715
It's my head

1085
01:35:58,923 --> 01:36:01,527
he's wanted all along. It's me.

1086
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,298
That snick is after.

1087
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,527
This government!

1088
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:08,506
This city!

1089
01:36:10,381 --> 01:36:11,527
Now listen.

1090
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:15,173
- War is bringing. - I know.

1091
01:36:16,006 --> 01:36:17,465
I know.

1092
01:36:20,381 --> 01:36:22,777
Then swear your loyalty to me.

1093
01:36:24,965 --> 01:36:26,735
To the Empire. Do it.

1094
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,944
Condemn him or get out.

1095
01:36:38,923 --> 01:36:40,277
I will do it

1096
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:43,923
On my knees, if necessary.

1097
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:46,319
And not only that.

1098
01:36:47,152 --> 01:36:49,206
In a few days I can gather other

1099
01:36:49,207 --> 01:36:52,152
bishops from province and monks from desert all against Cyril.

1100
01:37:03,506 --> 01:37:05,381
First I must ask you a question.

1101
01:37:06,631 --> 01:37:08,923
Orestes, do you believe in Jesus?

1102
01:37:10,069 --> 01:37:10,798
Do I what?

1103
01:37:11,006 --> 01:37:12,777
- Do you believe in Jesus? - Do I what!

1104
01:37:12,985 --> 01:37:14,652
Are you a true Christian

1105
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,777
or did you like so many others, only convert

1106
01:37:18,298 --> 01:37:20,173
- prospering politics? - Synesius.

1107
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:21,840
Why didn't you kneel?

1108
01:37:22,048 --> 01:37:23,819
- What choice did I have? - Why didn't you kneel?

1109
01:37:24,027 --> 01:37:25,381
What choice did I have?

1110
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,506
Betray Hypatia?

1111
01:37:29,548 --> 01:37:31,006
Condemn her?

1112
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:32,465
Would you have done that?

1113
01:37:32,673 --> 01:37:34,444
I would never offend God.

1114
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:37,569
It was he. He is offending God. He is offending him.

1115
01:37:37,777 --> 01:37:39,451
He is twisting...

1116
01:37:39,452 --> 01:37:41,735
Twisting...is what he is using the Scripture ...

1117
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,902
He read what is written.

1118
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:49,860
How many women do you obey?

1119
01:37:51,006 --> 01:37:52,360
How many?

1120
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:55,485
How many do you admire and listen to you?

1121
01:37:57,881 --> 01:37:59,027
Only

1122
01:37:59,444 --> 01:38:00,590
one.

1123
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,006
Only one.

1124
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:07,777
The Scripture ...

1125
01:38:08,402 --> 01:38:10,590
The Scripture is correct

1126
01:38:12,881 --> 01:38:14,860
and it was in his hands.

1127
01:38:17,152 --> 01:38:18,923
Brother, don't you see?

1128
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:21,423
Don't you see the insult to God

1129
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:25,485
in front of everyone?

1130
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:31,527
I do not know ...

1131
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,319
I do not know what I believe...

1132
01:38:36,527 --> 01:38:37,881
You have to tell him.

1133
01:38:38,298 --> 01:38:40,039
Don't tell me now, Orestes.

1134
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,110
Tell him you believe in what is written.

1135
01:38:42,152 --> 01:38:44,652
- I believe... - Don't tell me. Tell Him

1136
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:48,194
Tell God.

1137
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:49,965
Kneel!

1138
01:38:52,569 --> 01:38:53,923
Kneel!

1139
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:17,896
Many are those who remember

1140
01:39:17,897 --> 01:39:20,694
today the miracles of our beloved brother performed in life.

1141
01:39:23,715 --> 01:39:26,735
Like the time he commanded himself to the Father and threw himself

1142
01:39:26,944 --> 01:39:29,548
into the fire and wasn't even singed.

1143
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:32,152
Ammonius

1144
01:39:33,506 --> 01:39:36,840
Dead for bravely defending your faith in Christ,

1145
01:39:39,548 --> 01:39:41,735
I proclaimed you a motter,

1146
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,965
a saint.

1147
01:39:49,652 --> 01:39:52,465
From now on you shall be known as

1148
01:39:52,673 --> 01:39:54,965
Saint Taumasius.

1149
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:09,652
We want justice!

1150
01:40:09,756 --> 01:40:12,152
Justice!

1151
01:40:16,631 --> 01:40:18,194
May God show us the way, my dear

1152
01:40:18,402 --> 01:40:21,215
parabolan, little else can I say to you.

1153
01:40:28,402 --> 01:40:30,173
What about monks of Nitria?

1154
01:40:30,381 --> 01:40:33,194
Count to at least 500 of them. Plus

1155
01:40:33,298 --> 01:40:35,173
500 of our men?

1156
01:40:35,381 --> 01:40:37,985
You think that's enough. He's the prefect!

1157
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,069
He has a whole army to protect him.

1158
01:40:40,173 --> 01:40:41,319
Listen!

1159
01:40:41,944 --> 01:40:44,652
Why don't we do something much more simple and effective?

1160
01:40:44,756 --> 01:40:46,110
What do you talking about?

1161
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,235
We can hurt what worries him the most

1162
01:40:51,006 --> 01:40:52,048
How?

1163
01:40:52,465 --> 01:40:54,340
- That whore. - Who?

1164
01:40:55,694 --> 01:40:59,652
What if we dared to look at the world just as it is

1165
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:04,027
Let's shed for a moment every preconceived ideas.

1166
01:41:04,131 --> 01:41:07,152
What shape would it show us? What shape.

1167
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,902
You once said the problem lies in the inconsistency of the sun.

1168
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:12,985
Yes I did, good...good. Put it into words.

1169
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:18,819
The sun must be at the center since we revolve around it.

1170
01:41:19,131 --> 01:41:20,277
And at the same time

1171
01:41:20,485 --> 01:41:23,923
another position since our distance from it varies.

1172
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:25,902
- Yes, exactly. - How?

1173
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:31,431
How could it occupy two position at once?

1174
01:41:33,819 --> 01:41:36,319
How could it occupy two positions?

1175
01:41:37,465 --> 01:41:39,548
How could occupy two position at once?

1176
01:41:41,319 --> 01:41:43,923
How could occupy two positions?

1177
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:02,465
Aspasius...

1178
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:21,006
Yes, yes. There. And the other one here.

1179
01:42:21,215 --> 01:42:23,194
Keep the same proportion.

1180
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,340
Good, very good. Now tie this end to that torch.

1181
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,777
Aspasius

1182
01:42:38,506 --> 01:42:40,694
I want you to imagine that this is the Earth

1183
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,697
and the each of flames represent

1184
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:45,277
the two extreme positions of the sun in relation to it:

1185
01:42:45,485 --> 01:42:47,048
in winter and in summer.

1186
01:42:47,881 --> 01:42:52,048
What would happen if both of the positions were the two centers

1187
01:42:52,569 --> 01:42:53,923
of one in the same circle

1188
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:56,631
But it is impossible, mistress.

1189
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,212
Wait, what do we know about a circle?

1190
01:42:58,214 --> 01:42:59,548
We know that the center of the circle

1191
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:02,465
is always same distance to any point along its perimeter.

1192
01:43:02,673 --> 01:43:03,715
- Exactly. - Yes.

1193
01:43:03,923 --> 01:43:05,485
What if I divide the center into two

1194
01:43:06,215 --> 01:43:07,777
but what I keep constant is

1195
01:43:07,778 --> 01:43:10,902
the sum of there two distances to their perimeter

1196
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:16,527
Okay, I'll show you. Watch. As I move this rod along

1197
01:43:16,735 --> 01:43:18,923
the court, as one segment increases

1198
01:43:19,131 --> 01:43:21,319
the other segment decreases. And vice versa.

1199
01:43:22,465 --> 01:43:24,548
Therefore the sum of the two is always

1200
01:43:24,756 --> 01:43:26,735
gong to beconstant. You see that?

1201
01:43:27,985 --> 01:43:31,527
Now what if we apply this to the movement of

1202
01:43:32,777 --> 01:43:33,923
the Earth?

1203
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:49,235
What...

1204
01:43:52,256 --> 01:43:53,715
figure

1205
01:43:54,131 --> 01:43:56,215
will be...obtained ?

1206
01:43:59,965 --> 01:44:01,215
An ellipse!

1207
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:05,590
With the sun at one of its foci.

1208
01:44:07,569 --> 01:44:08,715
Because,

1209
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:11,110
what is the circle execept

1210
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:13,298
the very special ellipse

1211
01:44:13,506 --> 01:44:17,152
whose foci have jonted so close together that they appear to be one

1212
01:44:22,152 --> 01:44:24,340
Perhaps I'm completely raving, Aspasius.

1213
01:44:24,548 --> 01:44:27,985
I mean really why should this be so? Maybe I'm just .. ..

1214
01:44:28,506 --> 01:44:29,965
Maybe I'm...

1215
01:44:40,277 --> 01:44:41,735
What do you think?

1216
01:44:47,777 --> 01:44:49,652
It could very be so, mistress.

1217
01:44:59,548 --> 01:45:02,465
Right, well, we will continue with this tomorrow.

1218
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,652
Get some sleep.

1219
01:45:04,756 --> 01:45:06,215
- Good night, mistress. - Good night.

1220
01:45:08,506 --> 01:45:09,652
Thank you.

1221
01:46:21,944 --> 01:46:22,985
Davus!

1222
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:27,673
Davus!

1223
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,402
What are you doing?

1224
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,985
Lady.

1225
01:46:59,652 --> 01:47:01,215
Let me see.

1226
01:47:02,256 --> 01:47:03,923
Why do not you sit down?

1227
01:47:07,673 --> 01:47:09,131
Where is everybody?

1228
01:47:09,235 --> 01:47:10,798
Please sit down.

1229
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,881
I have...

1230
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:14,756
I have news for you, too.

1231
01:47:23,194 --> 01:47:24,548
All dignitaries

1232
01:47:24,965 --> 01:47:27,048
who yet embraced to Christian faith

1233
01:47:27,256 --> 01:47:29,235
are to be baptized

1234
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:31,735
in public.

1235
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:37,777
The aim is very clear:

1236
01:47:37,985 --> 01:47:42,569
to add to our course. All the Christians in the city,

1237
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:47,256
decent folk, prepare to

1238
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:49,756
fight for me.

1239
01:47:52,152 --> 01:47:54,131
You speak of peddling faith.

1240
01:48:00,381 --> 01:48:01,527
Okay.

1241
01:48:03,819 --> 01:48:04,860
Very well.

1242
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,225
Since everything seems to be decided already,

1243
01:48:09,267 --> 01:48:12,152
I didn't understand why you required my presence here.

1244
01:48:27,881 --> 01:48:29,860
I'm not a member of the government.

1245
01:48:30,277 --> 01:48:33,923
No, you're more than that. You are the person that I trust most,

1246
01:48:34,131 --> 01:48:35,277
and everyone knows it.

1247
01:48:35,485 --> 01:48:37,360
What you are saying?

1248
01:48:45,902 --> 01:48:46,944
Lady.

1249
01:48:50,277 --> 01:48:51,840
Years ago...

1250
01:48:54,131 --> 01:48:56,319
Years ago you taught us something.

1251
01:48:57,569 --> 01:48:58,610
If...

1252
01:48:59,131 --> 01:49:03,090
If two are equal to a third,

1253
01:49:03,298 --> 01:49:05,485
they are all equal to each other. Do you remember?

1254
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:06,527
Yes.

1255
01:49:06,631 --> 01:49:09,444
The three of us, we are all good people!

1256
01:49:09,548 --> 01:49:12,985
And you... you are as Christian as we are!

1257
01:49:17,777 --> 01:49:20,694
Synesius, you don't question what you believe.

1258
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,444
I can not.

1259
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:29,340
I must.

1260
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,298
That's a pity,

1261
01:49:43,506 --> 01:49:44,652
Lady.

1262
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:46,527
A great pity.

1263
01:49:48,194 --> 01:49:50,381
Our revered teacher

1264
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:53,298
take it away from what she has herself taught us.

1265
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:57,048
Or do you think I'm not aware the insane thing that you're involved.

1266
01:49:57,256 --> 01:50:00,381
- Synesius! - The Earth revolves around the sun.

1267
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,506
What next? Lady, what next?

1268
01:50:04,965 --> 01:50:06,631
I beg of you, just let me go.

1269
01:50:07,465 --> 01:50:08,923
Let me in! Let me in!

1270
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:11,631
- I need to speak to her! - A parabolans?

1271
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,756
- Lady! - Go away before we arrest you.

1272
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:17,465
- Leave! - Aspasius

1273
01:50:17,777 --> 01:50:20,590
It's me. Davus. Davus! Get of it.

1274
01:50:21,423 --> 01:50:22,673
- Tell them who I am! - Do you know this man?

1275
01:50:22,881 --> 01:50:24,340
Yes, what do you want?

1276
01:50:24,444 --> 01:50:27,048
I need to speak to her. Where is she?

1277
01:50:27,256 --> 01:50:29,756
- My Mistress is not here. - It is urgent! Where is she?

1278
01:50:32,048 --> 01:50:33,819
- Where? - The prefect palace!

1279
01:50:33,923 --> 01:50:36,631
- The prefect palace. Yeah, thank you. -Get out of here.

1280
01:50:38,194 --> 01:50:39,235
Who was that?

1281
01:50:40,902 --> 01:50:42,465
He was a slave once .

1282
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:51,631
Wait, please! Wait. I beg you

1283
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:05,694
If you don't agree, I won't be able to protect you any longer.

1284
01:51:07,152 --> 01:51:10,277
...I won't be able to have dealings with you.

1285
01:51:11,944 --> 01:51:13,506
Or even greet you.

1286
01:51:16,423 --> 01:51:17,569
Hypatia.

1287
01:51:19,131 --> 01:51:20,485
Don't you see?

1288
01:51:21,423 --> 01:51:23,610
I can not go on without you.

1289
01:51:24,965 --> 01:51:26,110
I can not.

1290
01:51:32,152 --> 01:51:34,235
Without you I can't defeat Cyril.

1291
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:37,360
Oh, Orestes.

1292
01:51:43,819 --> 01:51:45,798
Cyril has already won.

1293
01:52:03,715 --> 01:52:04,756
Thank you.

1294
01:52:05,173 --> 01:52:06,735
But I do not need you.

1295
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:36,319
Davus!

1296
01:52:39,131 --> 01:52:41,319
Brother! Where are you going?

1297
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,985
We found her!

1298
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,715
Whore, walk!

1299
01:53:28,923 --> 01:53:30,485
Move, sinner!

1300
01:53:34,027 --> 01:53:35,902
- Whore! - Pagan scum!

1301
01:53:46,735 --> 01:53:47,465
Witch!

1302
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:51,006
Pagan scum!

1303
01:54:04,548 --> 01:54:07,881
Move! Come on!

1304
01:54:10,173 --> 01:54:11,319
Witch!

1305
01:54:34,444 --> 01:54:36,006
Strip her naked!

1306
01:54:45,277 --> 01:54:46,319
Get up.

1307
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:52,881
That's it .So the God can behold you in all your filthy, whore.

1308
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,444
the way you knock the prefect, whore...

1309
01:54:54,652 --> 01:54:56,527
Pagan!

1310
01:54:57,256 --> 01:54:58,298
Whore.

1311
01:54:58,610 --> 01:54:59,444
Look,

1312
01:54:59,652 --> 01:55:00,798
She's not reacting.

1313
01:55:01,319 --> 01:55:04,340
She's scream all right with the skin on a knife.

1314
01:55:05,069 --> 01:55:06,944
- How many of you have a knife? - No

1315
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:13,298
Don't stain your hands with impure blood.

1316
01:55:15,902 --> 01:55:17,152
Let's stone her!

1317
01:55:18,506 --> 01:55:20,485
- Let's stone this Witch! - Get some stones.

1318
01:55:21,527 --> 01:55:22,985
- Quickly! The ones we threw Orestes,

1319
01:55:23,194 --> 01:55:24,444
they're still here.

1320
01:55:24,652 --> 01:55:26,840
I'll stay with her.

1321
01:57:32,985 --> 01:57:34,235
She fainted.

1322
01:58:05,798 --> 01:58:07,881
The body of Hipatia was mutilated and the remains...

1323
01:58:07,881 --> 01:58:09,965
...were dragged through the streets and burned in a fire.

1324
01:58:09,965 --> 01:58:12,048
Orestes was outlawed forever and Cyril...

1325
01:58:12,048 --> 01:58:15,173
...took control of the power in Alexandria.

1326
01:58:20,381 --> 01:58:23,506
Later, Cyril was declared a Saint and Doctor of the Church.

1327
01:58:28,715 --> 01:58:30,798
Although not any of Hipatia works remains,

1328
01:58:30,798 --> 01:58:32,881
it is known that she was an exceptional astronomer,

1329
01:58:32,881 --> 01:58:35,902
well-known for the mathematical study of conical curves.

1330
01:58:41,215 --> 01:58:43,298
One thousand, two hundred years later,

1331
01:58:43,298 --> 01:58:45,381
in the 17th century, astronomer Johannes Kepler...

1332
01:58:45,381 --> 01:58:47,465
...described that one of those curves,...

1333
01:58:47,465 --> 01:58:49,548
...the ellipse, governs the movement of the planets.
