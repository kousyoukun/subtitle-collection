The library was a not only cultural but a religious symbol,...

星星為何不會從天空墜落
why don't the stars fall from the sky

15
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,542
可你不同  你受過智者的教育
But you, who've had the teachings of the wise,

圓周運動主宰宇宙
Because the circle reigns in heaven,

22
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,917
因而星星永不墜落
the stars have never fallen and they never will.

並將萬物緊密相連
and pulls them together.

如果沒有中心
If there were no center,

48
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:20,531
那麼宇宙將會混沌不清  無窮無盡
then the universe would be shapeless, infinite,

142
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,667
那你就該緘默不語
Then you should say nothing at all.

143
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,438
好了
There.

144
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,979
謝謝您
Thank you.

145
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:48,438
我想讓你知道主人對此很失望
I want to know that the master is upset with himself about this.

146
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,354
那是什麼
What is that?

147
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,497
是我做的小玩意  女主人
Something I made, mistress.

148
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:02,708
這看上去像是一個
But it looks like a ...

149
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:06,667
這到底是什麼
What is it?

150
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,583
這是托勒密的天體系統
It's Ptolemaic system.

151
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,354
的確如此
Yes, it is.

152
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,208
這是你做的嗎
Did you make this?

153
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:18,438
這是地球
Earth

154
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,667
她是宇宙的中心
is the center of the cosmos.

155
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,208
而環繞四周的有
And revolving around it

156
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,066
太陽以及5大行星
the sun and the five wanderers:

157
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,938
水星  金星  火星  木星  土星
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

158
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,719
並沒有遵守圓周運行軌跡的規律
Obstinately disobeying the law of the circle.

159
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,208
然而托勒密卻向我們證明
Nevertheless. Ptolemy shows us

160
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,271
他們遵守圓周規律
that they do obey.

161
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:40,313
他們之所以繞圈運動
The fact that we see them move in a loop

162
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,750
是由兩個天體環形運轉合力而為
is due to the joint effect of two circles.

163
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,125
其中一個繞地球旋轉
One that travel around the Earth

164
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:53,958
另一個沿著較小的圓形軌跡自轉
and another less circle proper to each wanderer.

165
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,913
看  那是本輪
Well, look, the epicycles

166
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,708
你們所看到的並非真正的規律
So you see is not heaven on the earth

167
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,521
只是雙眼蒙騙了我們
but our eyes deceive us.

168
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,708
說的真好  達烏斯
Well said, Davus.

169
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,589
你的講解證明
I'd like you to know that your exposition shows me

170
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:11,979
你比在座的某些人更加用心
you are paying closer attention than one or two..others here

171
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,078
聽著  上帝在造物之前
I tell you The Gods should consulted to me

172
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,438
都應該先徵詢我的意見
before they created anything.

173
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,667
你這從何說起  俄瑞斯忒斯
Why do you say that? Orestes

174
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,479
所有的這些都太古怪了
It all seemed so whimsical!

175
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,292
為什麼是兩個天體環形運轉合力而為呢
Why the joint effect of two circles?

176
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:32,510
如果行星不按自己的本輪公轉
Would not it be more perfect if the wander is didn't wander

177
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,521
而只按一個環形軌跡公轉不是更合理嗎
and the single circle gives sense to everything?

178
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,750
俄瑞斯忒斯  你有什麼資格評判上帝的傑作
Orestes, by what authority did you judge the work of God?

179
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,333
我哪兒得罪你了嗎  基督徒
What is wrong with you, Christians?

180
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,979
難道人都不能開口說話了嗎
Can a man no longer open his mouth in this city

181
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,688
你批判天地萬物  你批判我們的主
You critisize creation,you critisize our Lords,

182
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,094
因而你冒犯了我們
and you offended us.

183
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:52,292
你該搬到沙漠裡去
You should move to the desert.

184
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,375
這樣你永遠都不會聽到這些逆耳之詞
You will not hear anything to offend you out there.

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,021
你們不知所云  所有人都如此
You know nothing about what you speak. None of you.

186
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,000
辛奈西斯  歐幾里得的第一公理是什麼
Synesius, What is Euclid's first rule?

187
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,438
你為什麼問這個
Why is the question?

188
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,104
回答我
Just.. answer me.

189
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,896
那個
If ...

190
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,229
等於同量的量
if two things are equal a third thing,

191
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,417
彼此相等
and they are all equal to each other

192
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:22,083
很好
Good.

193
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,417
你們都和我非常熟識吧
Now, are you both now similar to me?

194
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:30,417
是的
Yes

195
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,188
那你呢  俄瑞斯忒斯
And you, Orestes?

196
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,583
也是
Yes

197
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,000
在此我向你們鄭重聲明
Now I am actually saying this to everybody here in this room,

198
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,333
我們要團結而不是分裂
more things unit us than divide us.

199
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:46,979
無論外面事態如何  我們都親如手足
Now whatever may be going on the streets, we are brothers.

200
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,583
我們親如手足
We are brothers.

201
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,031
我希望你們記住
I want you to remember,

202
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:53,646
我們並非奴隸或者烏合之眾
the bros of slaves and riffraff.

203
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,333
現在我們用熱烈的掌聲
Now  I think we should all honred Davus's with

204
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,417
感謝達烏斯為我們講解這些知識
some very well end applause, so...

205
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:10,000
他們會決定我們每個人是生是死
They'll judge us all alive and dead!

206
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,396
到了那個時候就為時已晚
And then it will be too late,

207
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:16,458
只有那些信仰耶穌的人
because only those who believed in Jesus

208
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,229
才能得到救贖
will be saved.

209
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,729
你們此時不皈依吾主
What are you waiting for?

210
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:22,813
更待何時
What are you waiting for?

211
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,146
上帝之國在你我上方
The Kingdom of God is upon us.

212
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:29,271
你們聽懂我說的話了嗎
Do you understand what I am telling you?

213
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,729
聽懂了
Yes

214
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,542
你們明白嗎  要像個人
Do you understand like man do

215
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,146
或者你們不明白  就像只小羊羔
or do you not had, like sheep?

216
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,396
你在這看什麼
What are you looking here?

217
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,375
對  就是你
Yes, you.

218
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,250
你在這裡幹什麼
What are you looking here?

219
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:48,750
你是阿摩尼阿斯嗎
Are you Ammonius,

220
00:15:49,102 --> 00:15:50,206
那個創造奇跡的人
the man who formed the miracle?

221
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:53,333
你想看到奇跡嗎
Do you want to see a miracle?

222
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:55,625
你是他嗎
Are you the one?

223
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:57,083
我是
I am.

224
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,000
跟我來
Come with me.

225
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,563
耶穌走遍加利利  [馬太福音4:23]
Jesus went throughout Galilee

226
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,958
在各會堂裡教訓人
teaching in their synagogues,

227
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,771
傳送天國的福音
and preaching the good news of the kingdom

228
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:16,042
醫治百姓各樣的病癥
and healing every disease and sickness among people.

229
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,208
他的名聲就傳遍了敘利亞
His fame went throughout all Syria

230
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,750
來自世界各地的人們都慕名前來朝拜他
and people came to see him worldwide.

231
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,625
那是西奧勒斯
That's Theophilus.

232
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,125
我們的主教
The bishop.

233
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:32,917
因為天國是他們的
For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

234
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,625
哀慟之人有福了
Blessed are they that mourn

235
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,229
因為他們必得安慰
for they shall be comforted.

236
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,396
溫柔之人有福了
Blessed are the meek

237
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:46,250
因為他們必繼承土地
for they shall inherit the earth.

238
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:50,833
飢渴慕義之人有福了
Blessed are those who have hunger and thirst for righteousness

239
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,750
因為他們必得飽足
for they will be filled.

240
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:55,208
天主的世界
The word of God!

241
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,292
憐恤人之人有福了
Blessed are the merciful

242
00:16:57,813 --> 00:16:59,479
因為他們必蒙憐恤
for they will be find mercy.

243
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,125
清心之人有福了
Blessed are the pure in heart,

244
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,313
因為他們必得見神
for they will see God.

245
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,000
天主與你同在
The Lord be with you.

246
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,563
也與你同在
With you too.

247
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,646
你是怎麼穿過那火焰的
So how did you escape the flames?

248
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,354
-天主與你同在  -也與你同在
- The Lord be with you. - And with you.

249
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,375
你覺得呢  我祈禱而已
What did you think? I pray!

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,438
你可能都不知道該如何祈禱吧
You probably do not even know how.

251
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:28,333
你那包裡有什麼
What do you have in your sack?

252
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:31,146
-有吃的嗎  -這是我主人的
- Do you have any food of you? - It is for my master.

253
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:33,125
你沒什麼毛病吧
What's wrong with you?

254
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:36,042
給你的話我就得自己掏腰包了
I have to pay for that with my own money!

255
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,646
你要錢幹什麼
What do you need money for?

256
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,354
看看他們的眼神
Look at the faces.

257
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,875
來
Here.

258
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,583
我想讓你自己來試試
I want you to try it yourself

259
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:53,229
然後我教你怎麼祈禱
and afterwards I will teach you how to pray.

260
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,792
來
Come on

261
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,729
-天主與你同在  -主保佑你
- The Lord be with you. - Bless you.

262
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:02,604
看見了嗎
See?

263
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,583
這就是奇跡
That is the miracle!

264
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:07,708
繼續  接著發
Go on, keep doing it.

265
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:14,896
神與你同在
The Lord be with you.

266
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,667
謝謝
Please.

267
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:19,792
謝謝你
Thank you.

268
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,354
神保佑你
Bless you,

269
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,375
主保佑你
God bless you.

270
00:18:30,313 --> 00:18:32,604
保佑你
Bless you.

271
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,208
奴隸
Hi slave

272
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,667
你叫什麼名字
What is your name?

273
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:58,229
達烏斯
Davus.

274
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,938
奴隸達烏斯
Davus the slaves!

275
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,375
你像個真正的基督聖戰士
You look like a true parabolan.

276
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,083
一名真正的耶穌的戰士
A true soldier of Christ.

277
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,438
他們說什麼呢
What do they saying this?

278
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,729
讓他們跳舞
Telling them to dance.

279
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:23,438
他們正暢飲美酒呢
The men are now happy with wine.

280
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,500
出海旅行
All aboard!

281
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:28,958
多麼不幸的旅途
What unfortunate!

282
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,146
救救你的奴僕吧
Save your servants!

283

謝謝觀看  各位觀眾

285
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:47,871
我們現在要更換道具以及演出服裝

286
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:48,958
希望大家諒解

287
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,688
不好意思
Forgive me

288
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:02,188
原諒我的大膽
Forgive my boldness.

289
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:04,063
我是俄瑞斯忒斯
I am Orestes,

290
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,729
俄瑞斯忒斯家的兒子
son of Orestes.

291
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,958
我在這
I am here. ..

292
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:15,313
我在這想說出對哲學家希帕蒂婭的愛意
I am here to declare my love for Hypatia, the philosopher,

293
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:18,021
而她也深知這點
who no doubt know.

294
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,833
我採納了她給我的建議
Some time, now following her counsel,

295
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:23,854
我投身於音樂當中
I devoted myself to music

296
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:27,396
希望在聲音的和諧中尋求到一絲慰藉
hope so seeking solace in the harmony of it sound.

297
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,104
但對我來說
But for me,

298
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,271
只有我傾慕的女士身上才有這種和諧
such harmony resides only in my lady.

299
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:37,292
所以
So,

300
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,938
我站在這只是為了
my purpose here is merely to

301
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,229
獻上我的音樂
offer my melody

302
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,833
並且希望
and I hope to ...

303
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,521
不用再說了
Stop talking.

304
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,375
那人肯定很有前途
That man will go far. I tell you

305
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:54,896
如果我準備的是香蕉而不是無花果
If my prepared food for the banana not the fig,

306
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:56,563
我早就扔在他腳下了
I would have already falls that out his feet.

307
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:01,979
你準備怎麼回禮呢
What did it to be best to present

308
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,750
我嗎

309
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:05,893
怎麼回禮
How?

310
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:08,130
格來提  你能阻止的了你的女兒嗎

311
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:10,408
難道你不打算讓她嫁人嗎
Would don't you ever plan to marry her of?

312
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:14,670
希帕蒂婭嫁給一個男人  不讀書不教書
Hypatia, subject to a man? Without read and to teach?

313
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,624
甚至不談她的那些想法嗎
Or even to speak her mind?

314
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:21,531
我認識的最傑出的哲學家
The most brilliant philosopher I know,

315
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:23,646
必須要放棄科學
having to give up her science

316
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,771
不  那會讓她生不如死的
No, could be a death to her.

317
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:34,375
沒錯  她的工作受人敬仰
That's true. Her work is admirable.

318
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,708
並且她德才兼備
And she's wise and virtuous.

319
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,751
可是賽昂
But Theon,

320
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,750
別忘了她的處境啊
do not forget her situation.

321
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,354
她只是個女人
Being a Woman, I believe

322
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,542
我們在天上的父  宅心仁厚
Our Father, who art in heaven, reveal bear

323
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,083
別讓她答應別人
Don't let anyone else have her

324
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:07,604
求你別讓她答應別人
Please do not let anyone else have her

325
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:13,125
別讓別人  別讓她答應任何人

326
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,479
阿門

335
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,292
這是給你的
This is for you.

336
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,521
這是我的經血
It is the blood of my cycle.

337
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,146
俄瑞斯忒斯你
Orestes you...

338
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,583
你說你在我身上找到了和諧
you say you have found harmony in me.

339
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:32,882
那我建議你看看周圍
Well I am suggesting that you look elsewhere

340
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:35,625
因為我覺得周圍也存在著
because I think there is a little harmony or

341
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,542
和諧和美麗

342
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,125
你覺得呢
Do you agree?

343
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,771
昨天我們談到了阿波羅尼斯錐

344
00:25:56,979 --> 00:26:00,521
我們講了圓形  橢圓  拋物線
We speak of the circle, the ellipse, parabola.

346
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,354
不好意思  老師

347
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:10,313
奧林匹斯要你趕快到神廟去

348
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:12,917

感謝主
Thank you, Lord.

351
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:37,917
難道我們要忍受他們詆毀我們的信仰
Are we to enjoy them for speaking us the faith

352
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:41,979
習俗  甚至我們的人民嗎

353
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:44,063
-發生什麼事了  -這是種褻瀆
- What happened? - It's dispicable!

354
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,083
基督徒已經在城市廣場集會了
Christians have gathered in the agora.

355
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:49,167
他們在嘲弄我們的神明
They are mocking the gods.

356
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,771
我們必須阻止這些褻瀆
We must put end to these insults!

357
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,333
他們也許不怕他
They may not fear him,

358
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:56,563
但他們一定會怕我們的利劍
but they will fear our swords!

359
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:01,354
等等

你們要幹什麼
What is it you are going to do?

362
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,188
你們要去襲擊他們嗎
Are you going to attack them?

363
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,042
只因為他們的無禮就讓他們血濺當場嗎
Are you going to stain your hands with blood for an insult?

364
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:15,625
是對神明們  對神明們的褻瀆
The gods! An insult to the gods!

365
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:17,420
如果你覺得他們過分
If you think it so outrate,

366
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:18,958
應該直接去通知本地的提督
just go and announce the act before the prefect.

367
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,627
你好像在保護他們

我在盡力保護我們的學生們

369
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,252
而你  在煽動他們成為野蠻的殺人犯
You are inciting them to be wild murderers.

370
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:32,148
賽昂  作為首領  由你來決定吧
Theon, as director, you have the last word.

371
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:41,002
必須壓制他們對神明們的不敬
The insult must to be answered.

372
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,688
猶太教徒可以自願參加
Those Jews among you can do as you pleased,

373
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:45,169
這不是你們的戰爭
this is not your battle.

374
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:46,101
而這裡的基督徒們
As for you, Christians,

375
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,877
你們最好去找你們的耶穌
you would do well to join those of your own faith.

376
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,627
你不能讓我的學生走出這個建築
You will not caused my disciples out of this house!

377
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:55,481
-塞拉皮斯萬歲  -為了神明們

等我的命令
Wait for my command!

379
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:00,898
在我們包圍他們前不會有人懷疑我們的
No one would suspect us until we have surrounded.

380
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:05,481
這些鍵是給奴隸的  奴隸們
These swords are for the slaves! Slaves

381
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,669
奴隸也要參加
Slaves are also summoned!

382
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,460
達烏斯  回去

383
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,127

385
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:25,794
塞拉皮斯萬歲
Glory to Serapis!

386
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,148
讓我們聆聽她的聲音
Let us listen to her now!

387
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:52,773
你們聽到她的抱怨了嗎
Do you hear her complain?

388
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,335
沒有
No!

389
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:57,981
這一座也失聲了
This one has lost her voice too!

390
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:04,231
他們的嘴不能說話
Their mouths do not speak,

391
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:06,210
他們的眼看不到東西
their eyes do not see,

392
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:08,294
他們的鼻子聞不到味道
their nose does not smell.

393
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:13,502
但多神教徒卻要跪倒在他們面前
Yet still a pagan come here they kneel before them!

394
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:19,752
這是多麼的瘋狂啊
What madness is this?

395
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,190
順從神明們的旨意
By the gods!

396
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:30,273
梅多羅
Medoro!

保護你的主人  保護他
Take care of your master! Protect him..!

398
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,877

你聾了嗎  我說打啊
Are you deaf? I said fight

403
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:25,585
我是個基督徒

404
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,481
我是個基督徒
I am a Christian!

408
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:50,169

不  不
No! No!

入口  我們必須守住入口
The entrance, we must defend the entrance!

411
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:03,502
怎麼了
What's happening?

412
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,210
我們的人被基督徒打敗了
Our men might be sent by the christians!

413
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:24,752
父親
Father!

414
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:28,606
沒事  沒事
It's all right. It's all right.

415
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:32,460
怎麼了
What happened?

416
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,960
是他的奴隸干的
It was his slave.

417
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:40,585
達烏斯  給我拿些布那些水來  快
Davus, give me some cloth and some water, quickly.

418
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:42,669
父親
Father ...

419
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:49,231
辛奈西斯  我們得離開這裡
Synesius, we must get out of here.

420
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,690
扶住他別動
Hold him still.

421
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:06,627
基督徒們來了
Parabolans are coming!

424
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:29,856
-關上大門  -別  我們的人還在外面
- Close the gate! - No, no, our men are still out there!

425
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,940
願神明們保佑他們
May the gods protect them.

426
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:34,023
我說關上大門
Close the gate. I say!

427
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:01,963
別殺他  我們把他像那其他基督徒一樣
Do not kill him! We will keep him a hostage,

428
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,231
留作人質  大家都聽見了嗎
like the others. Did you hear that everyone?

429
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,835
你抓到的所有基督徒
Any Christian that you catch

430
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,294
如今都是人質
is now a hostage.

431
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,731
現在  把我們的傷者送去寺院
Now, take our wounded to the temple and Christians

432
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,483
基督徒帶到地下室去
down into the cellars.

433
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,419
眼神好的人去牆上觀察情況
Anyone with a good eye and a good aim up on the walls.

434
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:17,460
奧林匹斯
Olinpios.

435
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:19,648
他是個基督徒
This one is a Christian.

436
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:21,940
沒錯  還有那三個
Yes, and those three as well.

437
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,705
如果他們是基督徒  他們就得去地下室
If they are Christians, they will  go down to the cellars.

438
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:26,226
奧林匹斯
Olimpios...

439
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,700
如果你要囚禁我的兄弟們
if you are going imprison my brothers,

440
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,648
你就得把我也關起來
you are going to imprison me with them.

441
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:32,773
如果必須如此  我會這樣做的
If it is necessary, I will do that.

442
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,481
如果任何人
If anyone,

443
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:38,398
任何人
anyone,

444
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:43,606
敢碰我兄弟們一根指頭
dare lay a finger on one of my brothers,

445
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:47,148
我發誓我會刺穿他的身體
I swear I will run him through.

446
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:50,921
看
Look!

447
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,108
看這個
Look at this!

448
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:02,067
俄瑞斯忒斯
Orestes.

449
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:05,088
謝謝你
Thank you.

450
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,254
什麼時候開始
Since when there is

451
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:25,713
有這麼多基督徒的
so many Christians?

452
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:28,317
我們不得不和他們談判了
We will have to negotiate.

453
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:01,254
我們在等什麼
What are we waiting for?

454
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:03,004
一個基督徒君主能做些什麼呢
What can we expect from a Christian emperor

455
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:04,879
除非我們收起刀劍
except we put up the sword

456
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:08,421
至少我現在活了下來
I have settled for still being alive when it's worth to lives.

457
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,775
小心
Care we'll do.

458
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,213
請大家都不要擅自行動
No one should leave the group, please.

459
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:17,067
他們要整夜祈禱嗎
Are they going to pray all night?

460
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,046
達烏斯
Davus.

461
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,608
待在這兒
Stay here.

462
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,171
這裡很安全
It's safe here.

463
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:34,463
好好的留在這吧
Just stay here would be best.

464
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,733
辛奈西斯  你要幹什麼
Synesius! What are you doing?

465
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:25,504
老師  姐姐  母親
Lady, sister and mother,

466
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:28,421
願主祝福並保護你
May God bless you and protect you.

467
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:51,546
退後
Move back!

468
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:53,733
奴隸至死都吃這個
Slave end up eating this

469
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,754
奴隸排最後
Slaves get to the back!

470
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,671
三個一出現了
The three one come out

471
00:39:00,192 --> 00:39:01,858
會是場災難
It's a disaster.

472
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:03,838
父親  你什麼時候才能不擲骰子
Father, when will you leave the dice.

473
00:39:05,192 --> 00:39:06,963
今天有人看過傷口了嗎
You have been seen today?

474
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,942
-沒有  -沒有嗎
- No. - No?

475
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,275
讓我看一下
Let's have a look.

476
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,025
孩子  向我保證
Promise me, my child,

477
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:20,296
在我死後  忘記現在這個愚蠢的老頭
when I'm gone. You won't remember this foolish old man.

478
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,754
我保證
I promise.

479
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:26,442
記住我曾經的樣子
Remember me as I was before.

480
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:31,338
記住那個還能思考  並且
before when I could still think and

481
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:36,338
與你共事的我
I work with you,

482
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:39,775
記住我傾聽你心事時的樣子
and I listened to you.

483
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:43,629
我怎麼會犯下這樣的大錯
How could I've been so wrong?

484
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:47,692
如今  因為我的錯誤  讓你被被困在這裡
See. You here, locked up here because of me. ..

485
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,254
父親  請別說了
Father, please.

486
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:52,067
我希望你能夠自由
I wanted you to be free.

487
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:01,754
我是自由的
I am free.

488
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:06,546
基督徒們
Hey Christians

489
00:40:07,692 --> 00:40:08,838
基督徒們
Christians!

490
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:12,588
你們對上帝的那份自信哪兒去了
What's that confindent for the God of yours doing now?

491
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:15,608
進棺材吧  人渣
Coffins for you, scum!

492
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:37,483
告訴我
So, tell me.

493
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:40,088
那些神如今在哪裡
Where are the Gods now?

494
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:42,796
他們在哪
Where are they?

495
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,858
-可能也去找別人了吧  -別人
- Might as well look for others - Other?

496
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:50,192
哪一個  基督徒的上帝嗎
Which one? The God of the Christians, perhaps?

497
00:40:50,608 --> 00:40:52,379
真是太放肆了
Such boldness!

498
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:59,567
你怎麼想  老師  你是如此的勇敢
What do you think, Lady? You are so bold

499
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:06,338
把這盆活滅掉
Get the fire out.

500
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,463
你的確很大膽
You are indeed bold.

501
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,588
非常大膽
Very bold.

502
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:30,296
我一直在想你對我說過的那些事
I've been thinking about something you said to me.

503
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:31,546
我嗎
Me?

504
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:34,983
那天你質疑天體的運動軌跡
The day that you criticize the heavenly mechanism

505
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:39,704
而且你把它稱為無稽之談
and you called it whimsical.

506
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:41,129
是的  儘管
Yes, although..

507
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:42,692
其實
actually

508
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:44,775
我是在質疑托勒密的理論
I was criticizing Ptolemy

509
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:48,004
他的本輪理論讓一切都變複雜了
for complicating everything with epicycles.

510
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,650
但我不確定  也許只是有些欠考慮
But I do not know. Perhaps, just simple minded.

511
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:52,796
不是
No.

512
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,233
天空之上
The heavens

513
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,004
應當是簡單的
should be simple.

514
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,588
那麼我是對了還是
So am I right or..?

515
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:08,108
如果
What if ...

516
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,609
如果有個更簡單的理論可以解釋
what if there were a simpler explanation

517
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,942
那些行星又當如何
for the wanderers

518
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:16,754
有的
There is.

519
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:21,442
但卻太荒謬了  太陳舊了
But it's so absurd, so old

520
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:24,150
沒有人願意相信它
that no one gives it any credit.

521
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,608
那是什麼理論
What theory is that?

522
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:27,171
你是在說阿里斯塔克斯嗎
Do you speak Aristarchus

523
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,879
阿里斯塔克斯認為
Aristarchus maintained

524
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:31,754
地球本身在移動
that the earth moves.

525
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:35,817
而幾大行星的奇怪行為
The strange behavior of the wanderers

526
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:38,942
僅僅是我們的星球
was nothing more than an optical illusion

527
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:42,067
在圍繞著太陽運動時
caused by our movement

528
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:45,504
所產生的光學幻覺而已
in combination with us around the sun.

529
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,046
-以太陽為中心的模型  -是的
- A heliocentric model. - That's right.

530
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,129
太陽在中心
The sun would be in the center,

531
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,358
彷彿它是宇宙眾星的尊貴之王
as Memphis dignity deals King of the stars.

532
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:57,928
-讓我們變成了  -他的著作
- And make us just..  - His work was lost

533
00:42:57,929 --> 00:42:58,733
另一個行星而已
be another wanderer.

534
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:01,129
在主圖書館的一場大火中被燒燬了
in the fire that destroyed the Mother Library.

535
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:06,129
這就是我們必須好好保護這地方的原因
This is why we have to take great care of this place.

536
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:08,167
我們的圖書館
Our library

537
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:11,858
存留著人類的所有智慧
is all that remains of wisdom of men.

538
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:14,775
但每次扔一個物體
But every time you drop an object ...

539
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:18,108
誰在說話
Who speaks?

540
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:20,713
原諒我  女主人
Forgive me mistress.

541
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,504
我一直在聽
I was listening.

542
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,692
說吧  達烏斯
Speak up, Davus.

543
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,504
如果地球在移動
If the earth is moving,

544
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,733
每當扔下一個物體
every time you drop an object,

545
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:36,129
它就會落到後面才對
it would fall further behind.

546
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,192
而風應該會保持迎面吹來
And the wind would always blow against us.

547
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:43,317
鳥兒會迷失航向
And the birds would lose their way in flight.

548
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:45,296
我跟你說過
I told you

549
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:48,942
阿里斯塔克斯的假說一點都講不通
Aristarchus hypothesis make no sense at all.

550
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:54,254
我覺得你剛才說的可以被駁倒
I feel that what you just said can be refuted.

551
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,733
但現在我不知道如何去駁倒
But right now I do not know how.

552
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:27,275
給提督讓道
Make way for the prefect!

553
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:29,150
讓開
Make way!

554
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:32,171
給提督讓道
Make way for the prefect!

555
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:33,942
讓開
Make way!

556
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,338
大家都聽著
Listen everyone!

557
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:55,921
請大家認真聽並遵守君主的裁決
Prepare to hear and obey the verdict of our emperor

558
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,483
我  弗拉維烏斯·狄奧多西·奧古斯都
I, Flavius Theodosius Augustus

559
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:06,025
獵戶區省的君主和最高行政長官
emperor and supreme Head of the provinces of the Orions,

560
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:07,900
最近瞭解到
having been informed

561
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:11,338
在亞歷山大城發生的大事
of the event notice recently in the place in city Alexandria,

562
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,838
特此宣佈並命令大家
hereby declare and command

563
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:16,858
這些起義者將會得到保護
let the insurgents shall be protected and free...

564
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,838
而作為我寬宏大量的交換
In exchange for my generosity,

565
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:30,963
起義者必須馬上
the insurgents will abandon

566
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:34,463
離開神殿和圖書館
the Serapeum and the Library immediately

567
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,692
同時允許基督徒進入
allowing the Christians to enter

568
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:39,358
並處理掉所有卷軸
and dispose of the promsis

569
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,483
按其心意
whatever you like.

570
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:52,692
我們在期待什麼  他們會毀掉一切的
What are we expect? They destroy everything!

571
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:56,233
多神教徒將會從後門離開
Pagans will leave by the stable!

572
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:57,171
那些書
The Books.

573
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,192
從那裡你們會被護送至你們的家裡
From there you will be escorted to your home.

574
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:03,004
馬上執行
Obey within instance!

575
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:13,838
派一半軍隊去那邊
Send half a regiment to the other side.

576
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,338
其餘的等會過去
Send the rest later.

577
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:17,796
是的  長官
Yes, sir.

578
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:20,817
提督
Prefect.

579
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:23,213
我們們這樣堅持不了多久
We won't be able to contain this muff for long.

580
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:27,483
以十字架的名義  以十字架的名義
On the cross! On the cross!

581
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:39,775
留下那些次要的書
Let the lesser works!

582
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:43,108
-哪些是次要的  -拿走那些重要的
- What are the lesser works? - Just take important ones!

583
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:49,983
士兵們後撤了
The soldiers are retreating!

584
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:15,088
奴隸
Slave

585
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:17,275
-你們看到我的女主人了嗎  -快過來幫忙
- Have you seen my mistress? - Just get over here and help!

586
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:28,421
-我們拿不了這麼多  -我們需要更多幫助
- We can not carry so many! - We need more help.

587
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:34,161
請帶我的父親離開這裡
Please go and get my father out of here.

588
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:35,296
快帶他離開這裡
Get him out of here now.

589
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:44,254
奴隸
Slave

590
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:46,754
快  快走  快走
Come on! Go, go!

591
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:49,775
快點  快點
Come on, quickly!

592
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:55,921
希帕蒂婭和他的學生還在正廳裡
Hypatia and her students are still in the atrium.

593
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:57,171
他們瘋了嗎
Are they out of their minds?

594
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:01,025
既然他們想那樣  就隨他們去吧
If that's what they want, let them burn.

595
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:02,796
快點
Come on!

596
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,254
快點
Quickly!

597
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:17,483
小姐
Lady.

598
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:20,921
你去哪兒了  把那個袋子撿起來
Where have you been? Pick up that sack.

599
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:23,629
-小姐  我們得走了  -把那個袋子撿起來
- Lady We have to go. - Pick up the sack

600
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:29,150
為什麼到需要的時候  奴隸總是不在身邊
Why slaves never around when you need it.

601
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:33,421
-我剛才在  -快點走啊  快點
- I was ... - Move move you feet, quickly!

602
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:35,400
白癡
Idiot!

603
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:55,400
快跑
Run!

604
00:48:57,796 --> 00:48:59,983
快點  沒有時間了
Come on! There's no time!

605
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,838
老師
Lady!

606
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,963
我們得走了  別管這些了
We gotta go. You have to leave them.

607
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:16,650
上帝只有一個
God is one!

608
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,192
趕快
Hurry!

609
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:41,233
達烏斯
Davus!

610
00:49:41,963 --> 00:49:43,629
你要去哪兒
Where are you going?

611
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:46,311
-我們得走了  -達烏斯  你要去哪兒
- We have to go! - Davus, where are you going?

612
00:49:46,311 --> 00:49:48,421
如果他想為我們的神而死  就隨他吧
If he want to die for our Gods, let him.

613
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:50,088
達烏斯  不要  不要這樣做
Davus, no, please do not do this.

614
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:51,650
-快點  -達烏斯
- Come on! - Davus!

615
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:53,317
-達烏斯  不要  -快走
- Davus, no! - Come on!

616
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,275
以十字架的名義
By the cross

617
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:23,004
哈利路亞  哈利路亞  哈利路亞
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

618
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:40,817
奴隸
Slave

619
00:51:45,504 --> 00:51:46,754
達烏斯
Davus!

620
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,150
達烏斯
Davus!

621
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,692
奴隸達烏斯
Davus the slave!

622
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,713
幫我弄倒這個
Help me with this!

623
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,796
幫我
Help!

624
00:51:58,213 --> 00:52:02,171
哈利路亞  哈利路亞  哈利路亞
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

625
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:07,483
多神教徒的人渣
Pagan scum!

626
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,650
最沉重的傷痛都過去了
The most of wound is history.

627
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:03,712
我知道
I know.

628
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:08,608
我知道
I know.

629
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:41,733
達烏斯
Davus.

630
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,442
達烏斯
Davus!

631
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:32,567
你自由了
You are free.

632
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:35,275
走
Go.

633
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:37,254
走吧
Go.

634
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:02,254
從現在開始  在亞歷山大
From now on, in Alexandria

635
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:06,108
只許舉行基督教和猶太教的慶典
only Christian and Jewish worship should be permitted.

636
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:07,775
禁止一切多神教的祭祀
Pagan sacrifices,

637
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:11,108
禁止膜拜多神教的象徵物
worship of pagan symbols

638
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:14,754
禁止參觀多神教教堂
and visits to pagan temples should no longer be allowed.

639
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:19,442
任何人敢這麼做或注視它們的
If anyone commits such acts or dare look at the statues

640
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:24,129
古老神像  都將會得到嚴厲的懲罰
of their ancient gods, he shall be punished without mercy.

641
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:40,900
圖書館淪陷後  許多多神教徒皈依基督教
After taking the library, many pagans were converted...

642
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,025
希帕蒂婭則繼續教學和進行研究
Hipatia continued teaching and researching,...

643
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:46,108
而他之前的學生
...while his former students held...

644
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:49,233
成為了社會的中流砥柱
...important positions in the social elite.

645
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:52,358
整個帝國被一分為二
The empire was split in two forever.

646
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:55,483
許多基督徒認為這是世界終結的前兆
Many Christians saw this as a sign of the end of the world...

647
00:58:55,483 --> 00:58:57,567
於是決定過更神聖的生活
...and decided to prepare by practicing a more holy life.

648
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,254
基督教聖戰士穿梭在大街小巷
The order of "Parabolanos" Monks was charged to go...

649
00:59:02,254 --> 00:59:04,858
精力充沛地監督基督徒的品行
...through the streets and watch for Christian morality...

650
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:11,212
而猶太教徒的存在讓他們無法釋懷
...now uneven by the presence of the Jews.

651
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:33,817
該死的猶太人
Damn Jews!

652
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,275
該死的猶太人
Damn Jews!

653
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:44,442
他們只是一群沒用的惡棍  畜生
They're just a bunch of good-for-nothing thugs, bad animals.

654
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,358
喬瑞恩  我親愛的朋友  冷靜點
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

655
01:01:48,817 --> 01:01:51,212
讓西裡爾主教解釋一下吧
Let Bishop Cyril speaks his own defense.

656
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,025
提督
Prefect

657
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:56,004
我們那些神聖的聖戰士
our blessed parabolans,

658
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,025
他們僅僅是
Hung he has just called

659
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,212
在打拍子而已
piece of burden,

660
01:02:01,733 --> 01:02:04,650
只是為了附和他們打拍子而已
devote themselves truly enough to carrying burdens

661
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:07,775
他們都是殘疾人或者病人
crippled, sick,the lever ...

662
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:09,233
還有石頭
And stones!

663
01:02:09,442 --> 01:02:11,108
提督  他們帶了石頭
Prefect, they can carry stones.

664
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:13,214
突然衝進劇院
And now they burst into the theater

665
01:02:13,214 --> 01:02:16,004
他們知道我們無法自衛  還用石頭砸我們
and they stoned us knowing we'll do nothing to defend ourselves,

666
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:19,086
因為今天是安息日[不能使用任何工具]
because it is the Sabbath!

667
01:02:19,129 --> 01:02:21,004
在安息日這天  你們應該
On the Sabbath you should honor God

668
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:23,921
在猶太教會堂向主祈禱
in your synagogues instead of stuffing yourself

669
01:02:24,129 --> 01:02:25,692
而不是在劇院欣賞戲劇
with sweet set of the theater.

670
01:02:26,421 --> 01:02:28,296
正因為這個石頭才會落到你們頭上
That is why the stones fell upon you.

671
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:33,733
提督  聽到了嗎  他威脅我們  這太過分了
Prefect, you hear that? Now he's threatening us. This is too much

672
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:37,516
朋友們  我們要團結而不是分裂
Friends, there are more things that unite us than divide us.

673
01:02:37,516 --> 01:02:39,386
我們是兄弟  我們全都親如手足
We are brothers! We are all brothers

674
01:02:39,858 --> 01:02:43,696
沒有猶太人哪會有你們基督徒
Where would you Christians be without the Jews?

675
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:44,858
耶穌就是猶太人
Jesus was a Jew!

676
01:02:44,858 --> 01:02:47,150
耶穌就是猶太人
Jesus was a Jew!

677
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,379
我發現了點東西
There is something I find

678
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:22,462
可以反駁你所說的
stubbing what you told me.

679
01:03:22,775 --> 01:03:24,858
-是什麼  -好吧
- What? - Well

680
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:29,650
西裡爾為什麼要開始清理城市
Well, why Cyril begin cleaning up the city?

681
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:32,046
他已經擁有這麼多了還不滿足嗎
Is he not satisfied with what he already has?

682
01:03:32,254 --> 01:03:34,337
他只想嚇嚇猶太人
I think he's just trying to frighten the Jews.

683
01:03:34,546 --> 01:03:36,317
可為什麼要當你的面說
But why say it in front of you

684
01:03:36,837 --> 01:03:40,796
如果他想對付的是你  而不是他們怎麼辦
What if really he was addressing.. you and not them?

685
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:44,546
我  為什麼  我和他一樣都是基督徒
Me? Why? I'm as Christian as he is.

686
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,692
是的  可你忘記了
Yes, but you forget

687
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,817
你圈子裡許多人不是基督徒
that many of us from your circle are not.

688
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,900
滿帆  提督
A full sail, prefect.

689
01:03:52,983 --> 01:03:54,025
走吧
Let's go.

690
01:03:56,942 --> 01:03:59,546
-亞斯巴修  準備好了嗎  -是的  女主人
- Aspasius, are you ready? - Yes, mistress.

691
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:03,817
我要你拿著麻袋爬到桅桿的頂端
I would like you to take the sack and climb to top the mast.

692
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,379
好了  老師
And now, Lady,

693
01:04:20,587 --> 01:04:23,400
你能給我解釋一下這是怎麼回事嗎
will you finally tell me what the point of all these is?

694
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,733
亞斯巴修扔下麻袋的同時
When Aspasius drop the sack,

695
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:29,025
船在往前走
the boat will be moving forward.

696
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,587
因此麻袋
Therefore, the sack

697
01:04:30,796 --> 01:04:33,504
不會掉在桅桿下
not fall at the foot of the mast,

698
01:04:33,712 --> 01:04:37,879
而是會掉得往後一些  我想大概
but will fall further back. I wouly say about ...

699
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:43,087
大概會在這兒
about here.

700
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:45,379
這樣做有什麼意義嗎
And what's so special about that?

701
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,046
-太好了  -可你錯了
- Yes! - But You're wrong!

702
01:05:02,254 --> 01:05:05,907
是  但這是決定性證據  決定性的
Yes, but this is definitive prove. It's definitive.

703
01:05:05,907 --> 01:05:10,171
麻袋就像是在靜止的船上那樣掉下來
The sack behaved as if the boat was stationary.

704
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:12,046
那意味著什麼
What does that mean?

705
01:05:13,712 --> 01:05:15,171
我不知道
I don't know.

706
01:05:16,108 --> 01:05:18,608
但同樣的原理也可以應用在地球上
But the same principle can be applied to the Earth.

707
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:23,608
它可能繞著太陽轉而我們卻不知道
It could be moving around the sun without us realizing.

708
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:27,671
-阿里斯塔克斯的理論  -沒錯
- Aristarchus. - Exactly.

709
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:32,462
你為什麼要那麼較真呢  老師
Why do you so mean to yourself for that, Lady?

710
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:35,275
托勒密理論雖不完善
Ptolemy is not perfect,

711
01:05:36,004 --> 01:05:37,046
但卻很管用
but it works.

712
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:39,337
俄瑞斯忒斯  當時是你提出的
Orestes, but you are the one who

713
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:43,712
提督  幾年前你可沒有這麼務實
A few years ago you weren't so pragmatic, prefect.

714
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,671
幾年前我總是不經思考就發言
A few years ago I spoke first and thought later.

715
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,192
我看到了僊王座三
I have Cepheus third.

716
01:06:11,108 --> 01:06:12,254
三十七
37.

717
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:14,337
四十八
48.

718
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:20,900
金星和木星共同落在水瓶座裡
Venus and Mars share house in Aquarius.

719
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:29,337
我父親定會用美酒慶祝這種結合
My father would have celebrated such a conjunction with a good wine.

720
01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:33,296
-星星永遠不會落下  -真的嗎
- The stars will not fall. - Really?

721
01:06:33,817 --> 01:06:36,212
是的  因為它們都鑲在盒蓋上
No, because they are fixed to the lid of the chest.

722
01:06:36,421 --> 01:06:39,754
蓋子會打開兩顆心  然後耶穌就誕生了
The lid opens two hearts and then Jesus will appear.

723
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:42,567
你說的是什麼盒子
What chest for you talking about?

724
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:47,567
你不知道宇宙是個巨大的盒子嗎
Do not you know that the universe is a gigantic chest?

725
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:52,150
天堂是蓋子  地球是底部
Heaven is the lid on top and the Earth grounded.

726
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:56,525
他們沒告訴這個笨蛋地球是圓的
They haven't told this fool that the Earth is round!

727
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,400
地球是扁的
The Earth is flat.

728
01:06:59,025 --> 01:07:00,692
你的腦袋是扁的
Your head is flat.

729
01:07:01,108 --> 01:07:02,462
去看看聖經吧
Read the Scriptures!

730
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:04,754
如果地球是圓的
If the earth is round,

731
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:07,879
為什麼住在下端的人們不會掉下去
why don't the people live on the bottom fall off?

732
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:12,254
住在側面的人呢
What about the ones on the sides?

733
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:14,442
他們為什麼不會滑下去呢
Why don't they slide off?

734
01:07:16,317 --> 01:07:17,879
想想看
Think about it.

735
01:07:19,754 --> 01:07:21,004
達烏斯知道
Davus knows.

736
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:22,567
兄弟
Hi Brother.

737
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:24,025
你有什麼看法
What do you say?

738
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:27,150
地球是扁的還是圓的
Is the earth flat or round?

739
01:07:30,692 --> 01:07:32,462
只有上帝才知道這些
Only God knows these things.

740
01:07:38,192 --> 01:07:39,337
放在地上別動
Leave them on the ground!

741
01:07:39,546 --> 01:07:42,077
別管它們  它們就該放地上
Leave them on the ground! It is where they belong!

742
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:44,233
女士  請您不要灰心喪氣
Lady, you must not disheart.

743
01:07:44,962 --> 01:07:47,046
今天在船上您已經取得了很大的進展
Today on the boat you make great progress.

744
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:51,004
為什麼所有行星的亮度的變化
Why do the wanderers vary that brightness

745
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:53,504
會如此變化無常
so unexpectedly?

746
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:56,733
更糟的是
And what is worse,

747
01:07:57,358 --> 01:07:58,921
為什麼太陽
why does the sun...

748
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:03,087
為什麼它的體積在夏天和冬天會不同
why does it change size from summer to winter?

749
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:07,879
也許是因為它有時近
Perhaps because sometimes it is nearer

750
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:09,546
有時遠
and other times it is farther away?

751
01:08:11,108 --> 01:08:12,046
可是  亞斯巴修
But Aspasius,

752
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,337
看
watch.

753
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:18,608
按阿里斯塔克斯的理論  太陽一定
According to Aristarchus, the sun must be

754
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:20,379
是在萬物的中心
at the center of everything.

755
01:08:21,837 --> 01:08:23,608
而我們的地球
With us, the Earth,

756
01:08:23,817 --> 01:08:26,837
繞著它沿圓周軌跡在公轉
traveling in a circle around it.

757
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:32,046
因此  這就是關鍵
Therefore, and this is the key

758
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:36,629
我們和它一直
We are always at exactly

759
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:42,462
保持著同樣的距離
the same ...distance.

760
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,900
如果按你說的  距離會改變
Now if, as what you just said, we accept the changes in distance,

761
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:47,879
那麼我們就得
then we will force to add

762
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,212
在地球軌道上加一個本輪
an epicycle to the Earth orbit.

763
01:08:51,317 --> 01:08:55,379
這樣它才會時近時遠
So it's going to be nearer then it's going to be farther away.

764
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:59,025
這樣我們就陷入托勒密的謎團裡了
But now we fall in the same trap as Ptolemy.

765
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:00,900
-圈套著圈  -沒錯
- Circles upon circles. - Exactly!

766
01:09:02,358 --> 01:09:05,587
我不知道如何解決這個矛盾
So I just don't know how to resolve this conflict.

767
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:13,087
你覺得我們能解決
Let me know you think we can do this

768
01:09:16,004 --> 01:09:18,817
把太陽從中心移走  那麼
Displace the sun from the center. Well,

769
01:09:19,337 --> 01:09:21,108
並非必須在中心
not to have a center

770
01:09:21,733 --> 01:09:23,296
這讓我感到傷心  亞斯巴修
breaks my heart, Aspasius.

771
01:09:25,692 --> 01:09:28,087
告訴我  我該怎麼做
So, tell me what do I do?

772
01:09:30,275 --> 01:09:32,046
休息一下吧  女士
Rest, lady.

773
01:09:44,962 --> 01:09:46,837
基督聖戰士
Parabolans!

774
01:09:47,358 --> 01:09:49,650
-聖戰士們  -怎麼了
- Parabolans! - What happens?

775
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:53,087
聖戰士們  快來救命啊
Parabolans, quick! Help!

776
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,067
聖亞里罕德羅著火了
San Alejandro is on fire!

777
01:09:55,587 --> 01:09:56,733
著火了
It is a fire.

778
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,546
快點
Come on!

779
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:07,150
去提水  拿上水桶  拿著這個
Gather water! Get the bucket! Take this!

780
01:10:08,087 --> 01:10:09,962
-快點  -快點
- Quick! - Go! Go!

781
01:10:11,525 --> 01:10:12,983
快
Quick!

782
01:10:16,108 --> 01:10:17,983
快  快點  跑快點
Hurry up! Move, move!

783
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:26,317
聖戰士們
Parabolans!

784
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:29,025
聖戰士們啊
Parabolans!

785
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:30,900
聖戰士  快啊
Parabolans, quick!

786
01:10:33,504 --> 01:10:35,067
哪著火了
Where's the fire?

787
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:39,233
在那邊  那邊
Over there! Over there!

788
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:49,233
是猶太人  這是陷進
Jews! It's a trap.

789
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:50,900
這是陷進
It's a trap!

790
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:15,275
基督徒們
Christians all

791
01:12:16,421 --> 01:12:18,817
昨夜是悲慘的一夜
last night was the night deplorable.

792
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:22,254
現在我告訴你們
Now I say to you,

793
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:27,254
不要再為死去的兄弟們感到悲傷
grave no longer for our dead brothers.

794
01:12:28,296 --> 01:12:29,858
不要哭泣
Weep not.

795
01:12:33,608 --> 01:12:35,796
把眼淚留給其他人吧
Shed you tears for the others,

796
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:38,817
他們是劊子手
for they are executioners.

797
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:50,692
沒錯  沒錯
Yes, yes.

798
01:12:50,796 --> 01:12:53,817
為那些幹這件事的人哭泣吧
Weep for them, for those who have done this,

799
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:56,212
他們對上帝一無所知
they know none of God,

800
01:12:56,525 --> 01:12:58,817
沒有愛  沒有同情心
none of love, none of pity.

801
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,108
他們什麼都不懂
They know not.

802
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:07,065
因為今天他們重現了聖經裡的情景
Because in this day who repeated the world of Scriptures

803
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:08,817
卻對此一無所知
with no understanding at all.

804
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:13,400
他們只看到一個人
It is they who saw only a man

805
01:13:13,504 --> 01:13:16,421
那就是上帝的兒子  站在他們面前
when the Son of God was standing in the front of them.

806
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:19,337
也正是他們愚昧地嘲笑他
And it is they who in their blindness

807
01:13:19,337 --> 01:13:21,942
還將他釘死在十字架上
mocked Him and crucified him.

808
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:32,050
哭泣吧  哭泣吧  為猶太人哭泣
Yes, weep! Weep! Weep for the Jews,

809
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,546
他們害死了我們的主
those evil butchers of our Lord.

810
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:38,504
因為上帝
Because God ...

811
01:13:39,858 --> 01:13:43,504
上帝已經責罰他們了
God has already condemned them.

812
01:13:43,712 --> 01:13:45,067
這是上帝的旨意
It is God's will..

813
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,462
讓他們成為奴隸
that they live as slaves,

814
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:51,317
被詛咒  被流放  直到世界末日
cursed and exiled until the end of time.

815
01:13:51,629 --> 01:13:53,712
被詛咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

816
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:57,046
被詛咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

817
01:13:59,754 --> 01:14:02,254
被詛咒  被流放
Cursed and exiled!

818
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,087
女士  別停下  女士
Lady, do not stop, Lady.

819
01:15:17,254 --> 01:15:19,950
所有的猶太人都想要復仇
Now all the Jews want to retaliate!

820
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,712
恐怕你不清楚目前的狀況
I'm afraid you do not understand what is really happening.

821
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,462
一切結束後  亞歷山大就不再有猶太人了
When this is over, there would be no more Jews in Alexandria.

822
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,733
很抱歉這樣冒失地闖了進來
I am sorry to burst in like this.

823
01:15:36,942 --> 01:15:39,650
老師  你不該冒險來這裡的
Lady, you should not risk coming here.

824
01:15:39,858 --> 01:15:41,525
軍隊在哪
Where are the troops?

825
01:15:43,087 --> 01:15:45,171
為什麼街道上沒有士兵
Why are there no more soldiers on the streets?

826
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:48,608
在那種混亂中  沒有軍隊可以控制整個城市
No army can contain entire city in that frenzy.

827
01:15:51,108 --> 01:15:54,650
他要求殺光所有的婦女和兒童
He's calling for the annihilation of women and children

828
01:15:55,587 --> 01:15:56,733
他是主教
A bishop!

829
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:59,337
-他是基督徒  -那就把他關起來
- A Christian! - Then lock him up.

830
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:06,317
提督  你應該逮捕他
Prefect, you should have him arrested.

831
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:11,733
事情沒那麼簡單
It's not so easy.

832
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:17,358
女士  西裡爾知道我們有相同的信仰
Lady, Cyril knows we both share the same faith.

833
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:23,087
這讓我們的長官進退兩難
That place our prefect in the very awkward position.

834
01:16:23,817 --> 01:16:25,483
如果他為猶太人辯護
If he defends the Jews,

835
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,671
會有一半的市民反對政府
half the city will rise against this government.

836
01:16:29,754 --> 01:16:30,796
我明白了
I see.

837
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,796
可如果現在你什麼都不做
If you choose to do nothing though,

838
01:16:36,212 --> 01:16:40,342
我相信西裡爾會繼續重複相同的事
I believe Cyril will continue to do the same thing

839
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:45,867
直到殺光城裡的最後一個人
over and over again until there is no one left in this city,

840
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:48,504
就沒人可以讓政府管理了
no people for this government to govern.

841
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:03,504
我太幼稚了
How naive with me.

842
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:09,546
我真幼稚  居然寄希望於最終的改變
How naive with me to think with a final change.

843
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:54,233
猶太人滾出去
Jews out!

844
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,462
他們先殺了他們
First they kill them

845
01:18:17,879 --> 01:18:19,546
然後埋了他們
and they buried them.

846
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,608
是昔蘭尼的主教
The Bishop of Cyrene.

847
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:36,733
-他來這兒幹什麼  -我去看看
- What is he doing here? - I'll find out.

848
01:18:39,337 --> 01:18:41,837
這是我的小亞歷山大圖書館
It's my little library of Alexandria.

849
01:18:46,629 --> 01:18:48,504
我在這裡教孩子們知識
This is where I teach children.

850
01:18:51,212 --> 01:18:52,775
阿波羅尼斯圓錐體
An Apollonius cone.

851
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:56,317
是的  我用它來教孩子們四種不同曲線
Yes, I built it to teach them about the four curves.

852
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:57,879
圓形
Circle,

853
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:00,692
橢圓形
the ellipse ...

854
01:19:03,817 --> 01:19:05,379
俄瑞斯忒斯應該早到了才對
Orestes should be here by now.

855
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:06,733
拋物線
The parabole

856
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:09,129
雙曲線
and hyperbola.

857
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,462
真是美極了
It's truly beautiful.

858
01:19:13,608 --> 01:19:16,421
我常看著它去思考
You know I often look at it and wonder

859
01:19:16,525 --> 01:19:18,504
為什麼相同的圓軸
why the circle co axis

860
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,483
會產生如此多不同的形狀
is such impure shapes.

861
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:26,421
不如我坐在這裡再聽你講一次課
What I get to sit here and listen to you again

862
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:28,087
看來讓你無聊了
I bored you.

863
01:19:28,608 --> 01:19:30,542
我已經很久沒有教書了
It's been a long time since I've done anything

864
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:32,046
只是在研究天體系統上絞盡腦汁
but beat my head against system.

865
01:19:33,192 --> 01:19:35,900
然而卻無人關注它的重要性
And how they're more important matters a hand.

866
01:19:36,108 --> 01:19:37,046
抱歉  我來晚了
Forgive me.

867
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:52,150
一個多神教徒控制著兩個基督徒
Two Christians in the hands of a pagan.

868
01:19:52,358 --> 01:19:53,817
真是不可容忍
It's an outrage!

869
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:02,671
真是不可容忍
It's an outrage.

870
01:20:24,025 --> 01:20:27,671
-這裡有多少  -不知道  但會發出惡臭
- How many? - I do not know, but it will stink.

871
01:20:34,233 --> 01:20:35,483
阿摩尼阿斯
Ammonius

872
01:20:36,942 --> 01:20:38,504
上帝跟你說過話嗎
Does God speak with you?

873
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:41,421
你總是這樣
All the time.

874
01:20:42,775 --> 01:20:46,108
阿摩尼阿斯這樣  阿摩尼阿斯那樣
Ammonius this, Ammonius that. Ammonius...

875
01:20:47,046 --> 01:20:48,712
今天他對我說得極快
Today he spoke to me

876
01:20:48,817 --> 01:20:52,150
非常快  我不得不請求他說慢點
so quickly that I had to ask him slow down

877
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,108
告訴我
Tell me something.

878
01:20:57,671 --> 01:20:59,129
你認為我們是錯的嗎
Do you ever think we have mistaken?

879
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,087
為什麼這麼說
Why?

880
01:21:09,025 --> 01:21:10,587
我曾被寬恕過
I was forgiven,

881
01:21:13,712 --> 01:21:16,108
但現在  我無法寬恕別人
But now, I can not forgive.

882
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:18,921
寬恕
Forgive?

883
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,796
誰
Who?

884
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,296
猶太人嗎
The Jews?

885
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,025
耶穌在十字架上寬恕了他們
Jesus pared them on the cross.

886
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:33,504
耶穌是上帝
Jesus was God

887
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:36,837
只有他才有這種寬容心
And only he can show such clemency.

888
01:21:37,462 --> 01:21:40,379
你怎麼敢拿自己跟上帝相提並論
How dare you to compare yourself to God?

889
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:45,692
兄弟
Brother.

890
01:21:49,233 --> 01:21:51,004
我們現在還活著
You're still alive.

891
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,400
因為什麼
Why?

892
01:21:54,025 --> 01:21:55,171
因為
Because it was

893
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:57,879
是上帝的旨意讓我們沒被石頭打死
his will save us from the stones.

894
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:03,608
上帝讓我們在此  行該做之事
God wants us here, doing what we do.

895
01:22:04,233 --> 01:22:06,317
你不再相信這些了嗎
Don't you believe in that anymore?

896
01:22:23,296 --> 01:22:24,337
閣下
My Lord ...

897
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:32,775
西裡爾是個驕傲的男人
Cyril is very proud man.

898
01:22:33,712 --> 01:22:36,436
他同意會面  但只磋商和平議題
Agree to meet but will not discuss the Jews,

899
01:22:36,437 --> 01:22:37,879
不商討猶太人問題
only discuss peace.

900
01:22:40,067 --> 01:22:41,108
和平
Peace?

901
01:22:41,317 --> 01:22:45,067
作為您卑微的參謀  我的建議是
My suggestion, as your humble adviser in this affair,

902
01:22:45,275 --> 01:22:47,046
請您接受提議
is for you to accept.

903
01:22:47,983 --> 01:22:49,337
和平是最重要的
Let peace be for most.

904
01:22:51,317 --> 01:22:53,712
-老師  你怎麼看  -我
- Lady, what do you think? - Well... I ...

905
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:56,629
我覺得這個提議並沒有那麼好
I don't think it is very encouraging.

906
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,442
為什麼他來見俄瑞斯忒斯
Why would he want to come and see Orestes

907
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:02,254
-卻沒有任何實質性的計劃  -還有其他的
- without concrete proposals? - There's something else

908
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:05,275
他要來見你
He want come to you.

909
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:08,400
但需要你在圖書館和他見面
Demands you meets in the Library

910
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:09,962
在星期天的禮拜中
During the Sunday's service.

911
01:23:10,171 --> 01:23:12,567
在圖書館嗎  為什麼
In the Library? Why?

912
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:14,995
那次搶佔之後
Only Christians have been permitted

913
01:23:14,996 --> 01:23:16,837
只有基督徒才能進入圖書館
to entered there since it's tombed.

914
01:23:17,046 --> 01:23:19,129
這是挑釁
It is a provocation!

915
01:23:22,254 --> 01:23:23,817
請允許我說幾句
Allow me to suggest.

916
01:23:24,962 --> 01:23:27,254
如果你覺得你的到場
If you consider your presence

917
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:28,712
是如此的重要
so essential

918
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:30,900
為什麼你不接受洗禮呢[信奉基督教]
Why not let yourself be baptized?

919
01:23:34,129 --> 01:23:35,796
我們中的大多數人  包括最高長官
The majority of us here, beginning

920
01:23:36,004 --> 01:23:38,712
都已經接納了基督教
with our prefect, have accepted Christ.

921
01:23:39,129 --> 01:23:40,900
剩餘的這些人為什麼不行呢
Why not the rest of you?

922
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:44,129
這只是個時間問題  你們心知肚明
It's only a matter of time and you know it!

923
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,483
是嗎
Really?

924
01:23:46,733 --> 01:23:48,817
這真的只是個時間問題嗎
Is it only a matter of time?

925
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,317
請容許我說幾句
Well, excuse me,

926
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:53,296
尊敬的元老  但據我所知
Honorable Member but as far as I'm away..

927
01:23:53,504 --> 01:23:55,692
你們的上帝並不能證明他自己
Your God has not yet proved

928
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,129
比他的前任們更公正更仁慈
Be more just or more mercyful than their predecessors.

929
01:23:59,337 --> 01:23:59,962
老師
Lady.

930
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:03,921
讓我接受你們的信仰真的只是時間問題嗎
Is it really just a matter of time before I accept your faith?

931
01:24:04,962 --> 01:24:06,421
那是什麼
Why, then,

932
01:24:06,942 --> 01:24:08,608
難道這次會議
Should this assembly

933
01:24:09,233 --> 01:24:12,671
要接受一個毫無信仰的人
accept the consult of someone who admittedly

934
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,004
提出的提議嗎
believes in absolutely nothing?

935
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:20,067
我信仰哲學
I believe in philosophy.

936
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,546
哲學
Philosophy.

937
01:24:25,275 --> 01:24:27,046
正是現在這種時候
Just what we need

938
01:24:27,358 --> 01:24:29,025
我們所需要的東西
in times like this.

939
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:31,421
夠了
Enough!

940
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:44,754
這些年來我一直在研究
All these years I've been studying.

941
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:49,129
完全沒有了自己的生活
Absolutely no life for my own,

942
01:24:49,858 --> 01:24:51,629
我想知道
and I wonder

943
01:24:54,025 --> 01:24:57,671
-我這樣為了什麼那  -忘了今天那些話吧
- What was the point  - Forget about what was said today.

944
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,983
是生活困住了我嗎
Is this all life holds for me?

945
01:25:05,275 --> 01:25:06,525
還能是什麼
What else?

946
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:10,171
我覺得沒人能看出
I doubt anyone can see you

947
01:25:10,483 --> 01:25:11,837
你是一位忠誠的妻子
as a devoted wife

948
01:25:12,046 --> 01:25:13,087
一位盡心的母親
and mother.

949
01:25:13,921 --> 01:25:15,067
我認為
I think ...

950
01:25:15,692 --> 01:25:19,119
城裡的所有人都聽說了手帕的故事
I think everyone in the city know the history of the handkerchief.

951
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:24,650
所以
So ...

952
01:25:29,442 --> 01:25:31,212
我父親也會喜歡女人
My father loved woman.

953
01:25:31,942 --> 01:25:33,192
連他也不例外
Even he ...

954
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:36,715
有誰不愛呢
Who've ever loved?

955
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:41,475
除了你
Except you,

956
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:42,621
黎巴農斯
Lebanons.

957
01:25:54,392 --> 01:25:55,850
如果我能
If I could just...

958
01:25:59,704 --> 01:26:01,371
解開這個謎團
just unravel this ...

959
01:26:01,497 --> 01:26:03,059
只需要再多努力一點
Just a little bit more.

960
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:11,319
只要離答案再接近一些  那麼
And just get a little closer to the answer, then

961
01:26:11,944 --> 01:26:13,610
這樣  我就能
then I would...

962
01:26:15,694 --> 01:26:18,090
我就能安然入土
Then I would go to my grave, a happy women.

963
01:26:20,381 --> 01:26:21,527
為什麼
Why?

964
01:26:22,256 --> 01:26:24,131
為什麼這些對你如此重要
Why does that mean so much to you?

965
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:28,402
就是現在
Right now,

966
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:33,506
就在這一秒  整個世界可能都在移動
this every second, whole earth could be moving

967
01:26:33,715 --> 01:26:35,798
卻沒有人意識到這些
and no one realized it.

968
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:38,506
只有你和我知道
Except you and me

969
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:41,006
相信我  老師  幸虧沒人意識得到
Believe me Lady, it's best that no one does.

970
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,902
你覺得這些真的不重要嗎
Do you really not think it important?

971
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:46,995
我不明白你為什麼
I do not understand why

972
01:26:46,996 --> 01:26:48,610
堅信人們腳下的土地是移動的呢
you insist on moving the ground we walk on.

973
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,006
你也看到了船上發生的
You saw of yourself what happened on the boat.

974
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:54,131
是的  但那也不能證明地球在移動
Yes I did,But that does not mean this sailing on the earth moves.

975
01:26:55,173 --> 01:26:56,527
如果確實是這樣呢
What if it does

976
01:26:57,152 --> 01:26:59,235
希帕蒂婭  看看你的周圍
Hypatia, look around you.

977
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,798
死亡
Death

978
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:02,256
恐懼
Horror

979
01:27:02,465 --> 01:27:03,819
毀滅
Destruction.

980
01:27:03,923 --> 01:27:06,735
如果地球真的在圓形軌道中移動
If the stars move in a Circle

981
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,756
他們為什麼不把完美分給我們一些呢
Why would they share their perfection with us

982
01:27:12,881 --> 01:27:14,340
所以我們沒有移動
So we don't move.

983
01:27:14,652 --> 01:27:16,006
只是不在圓形軌道中
In a circle.

984
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:17,777
我們不是按照圓形
We do not move ...

985
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:22,881
運動的
for a circle.

986
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:26,423
我們並非在圓形軌道中移動
We do not move in circles.

987
01:27:35,694 --> 01:27:37,152
從柏拉圖開始
Ever since Plato,

988
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,110
所有人  包括阿里斯塔克斯  希巴克斯  托勒密
All of them: Aristarchus Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

989
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:45,173
所有人都試圖用圓形軌道
They have all... tried reconcile their observations

990
01:27:45,381 --> 01:27:47,256
來解釋他們的觀察結果
with circular orbits.

991
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:49,860
但如果在宇宙中隱藏著其他形狀呢
But What if other shapes  hidden in the heavens

992
01:27:50,173 --> 01:27:51,840
其他形狀
Another shapes?

993
01:27:52,152 --> 01:27:53,928
女士  沒有任何形狀比圓形更完美
Lady, There is no purer than the circle,

994
01:27:53,929 --> 01:27:55,173
這是你教我們的
you taught us that.

995
01:27:55,381 --> 01:27:58,402
我知道  只是假設
I know, but suppose, just suppose

996
01:27:58,610 --> 01:27:59,756
正是圓形的完美
That the purity of the circle

997
01:27:59,965 --> 01:28:03,715
讓我們忽視了其他的一切
has blinded us from seeing anything beyond it.

998
01:28:04,027 --> 01:28:06,006
就像耀眼的太陽讓我們
In the same way that glared sun blind us from actually seeing

999
01:28:06,006 --> 01:28:07,777
看不見星星一樣
the stars.

1000
01:28:08,298 --> 01:28:09,965
我必須重新
I must begin all over with

1001
01:28:10,173 --> 01:28:12,569
重新審視這個問題
with new eyes. I must...

1002
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:16,423
我必須重新思考一切
I must rethink everything.

1003
01:28:17,048 --> 01:28:17,985
所有的一切
Everything.

1004
01:28:31,423 --> 01:28:34,652
從保羅寫給提摩太的第一封信開始讀
Reading from the first letter Paul to Timothy.

1005
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:38,819
我願男人
I desired therefore that everywhere

1006
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:42,569
舉起聖潔的手  隨處禱告
men should lift up their holy hand in prayer

1007
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:46,319
無忿怒  無爭論
Without anger or disputing.

1008
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,735
又願女人
In like manner I desire women to

1009
01:28:52,777 --> 01:28:54,340
廉恥  自守
dress modestly,

1010
01:28:55,381 --> 01:28:58,402
以正派衣裳為妝飾
decency and propriety

1011
01:28:58,506 --> 01:29:00,069
不以編發
not with braided hair

1012
01:29:01,631 --> 01:29:04,340
黃金  珍珠
or gold or pearls

1013
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:06,423
和貴價的衣裳為妝飾
or expensive clothes.

1014
01:29:08,298 --> 01:29:11,006
-只要有善行  -為什麼讀這段
- But with good deeds. - Why is he reading this passage?

1015
01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:12,681
不知道  首領
I do not know, prefect.

1016
01:29:12,682 --> 01:29:14,965
但我肯定這不是事先說好的那段
I assure you it's not the one we agreed upon.

1017
01:29:15,902 --> 01:29:18,090
女人要沉靜學道
Let the woman learn

1018
01:29:18,298 --> 01:29:21,631
一味的順服  我不許女人講道
in quietness and in full submission, I do not permit a woman

1019
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,277
也不許他轄管男人
to teach, or to have authority over a man.

1020
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,444
只要
But to be

1021
01:29:30,173 --> 01:29:31,735
沉靜
in Silent

1022
01:29:38,402 --> 01:29:40,381
這是上帝之言
This is the word of God!

1023
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:41,944
阿門
Amen.

1024
01:29:42,569 --> 01:29:43,610
阿門
Amen.

1025
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:47,152
當耶穌把自己的神聖遺產
Jesus himself

1026
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:49,860
托付給他的十二門徒時
knew this when he

1027
01:29:50,069 --> 01:29:53,298
他自己非常瞭解這些
he entrusted his holy legacy to twelve men.

1028
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:55,381
全是男人
Men.

1029
01:29:55,902 --> 01:29:57,777
沒有一個女人
Not a woman among them.

1030
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,381
但是
And yet

1031
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:04,444
我知道亞歷山大有些人
I know some in Alexandria

1032
01:30:04,652 --> 01:30:07,256
他們仰慕某個女人並且對她的話
they admire and even trust in words

1033
01:30:07,465 --> 01:30:08,819
言聽計從
of a woman.

1034
01:30:09,235 --> 01:30:11,110
哲學家希帕蒂婭
The philosopher Hypatia.

1035
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,860
這個女人曾公然表示過
A woman who declare,

1036
01:30:14,965 --> 01:30:17,673
她對上帝的不忠
in public, her ungodliness.

1037
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:23,194
她是個女巫
A witch!

1038
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,985
官員們
Dignitaries,

1039
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:33,402
你們現在應該全部信奉基督
It is the time for you all to reconcile yourself with Christ.

1040
01:30:44,235 --> 01:30:46,110
這是上帝之言
This is the word of God.

1041
01:30:48,923 --> 01:30:51,735
在聖經面前下跪  並接受真理吧
Kneel before it and embrace its truth.

1042
01:31:34,444 --> 01:31:35,485
跪下
Kneel.

1043
01:31:37,048 --> 01:31:38,819
他不準備跪下嗎
Is he not going to kneel?

1044
01:31:42,465 --> 01:31:44,340
他不準備跪下嗎
Is he not going to kneel?

1045
01:31:52,985 --> 01:31:54,131
跪下
Kneel!

1046
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,110
跪下
Kneel!

1047
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,715
罪人
Sinner

1048
01:32:15,485 --> 01:32:17,048
我是基督徒
I am a Christian

1049
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:19,652
-我是基督徒  -不  你不是
- I am a Christian! - No you are not!

1050
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,152
我是和你們一樣的基督徒
I'm as Christian as you are

1051
01:32:22,673 --> 01:32:25,173
給提督讓路
Make way for the prefect!

1052
01:32:26,006 --> 01:32:27,152
讓路
Make way!

1053
01:32:38,402 --> 01:32:40,485
我是受過洗禮的基督徒
I am a baptized Christian!

1054
01:32:41,215 --> 01:32:43,090
我是受過洗禮的基督徒
I am a baptized Christian!

1055
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,235
我要殺了你
I'll kill you.

1056
01:32:54,548 --> 01:32:55,902
我是和你們一樣的基督徒
I'm as Christian as you

1057
01:32:57,048 --> 01:32:58,819
我是和你們一樣的基督徒
I'm as Christian as you are

1058
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:46,527
怎麼會發生這種事
How could such a thing be possible?

1059
01:33:47,256 --> 01:33:49,027
罪犯已經被繩之以法了
The culprit has been executed .

1060
01:33:49,756 --> 01:33:51,719
立即帶我去見提督
I would like you to take me to the prefect immediately.

1061
01:33:51,771 --> 01:33:53,402
女士  他親自下令
Lady, he himself gave the order

1062
01:33:53,506 --> 01:33:56,527
讓你待在家裡等進一步的通知
for you to be confined to the house until further notice.

1063
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:59,965
現在這種情況我建議你不要在街上出現
At the moment your presence on the street is not advisable

1064
01:34:01,423 --> 01:34:02,569
為什麼
For what reason?

1065
01:34:05,798 --> 01:34:08,819
西裡爾對你進行了嚴厲的譴責
Cyril make serious accusation against you.

1066
01:34:11,423 --> 01:34:12,465
那麼
And then. ..

1067
01:34:13,298 --> 01:34:15,277
他控訴我什麼罪名
What is he accused me of?

1068
01:34:16,006 --> 01:34:17,465
對上帝不虔誠
Ungodliness  .....

1069
01:34:18,506 --> 01:34:19,860
還有使用巫術
and witchcraft.

1070
01:34:25,798 --> 01:34:26,944
我知道了
I see.

1071
01:34:38,819 --> 01:34:40,590
你在為什麼事而煩惱嗎  女士
Is something bothering you, Lady?

1072
01:34:41,735 --> 01:34:42,777
沒有
No.

1073
01:34:46,631 --> 01:34:48,819
不如你來告訴我你在擔心什麼
Why don't you tell me what's worrying you.

1074
01:35:12,048 --> 01:35:13,819
提督  咬住這個
Prefect, why don't you bite on it.

1075
01:35:16,215 --> 01:35:17,360
說
Speak.

1076
01:35:17,465 --> 01:35:19,652
昔蘭尼的主教想見您
The Bishop of Cyrene want to see you.

1077
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:23,715
所有人都出去
Leave, all of you.

1078
01:35:23,923 --> 01:35:25,485
提督  傷口還沒處理好
Prefect, the wound is still not ...

1079
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:27,881
出去  出去
Get out. Get out!

1080
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:34,548
所有人出去
All of you! Out!

1081
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,694
你們沒能殺死我啊
Without went well.

1082
01:35:47,673 --> 01:35:50,069
你認為我也參與這件事了嗎
You think I had a part in this?

1083
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:52,673
如果我想背叛你  怎麼還會來到你面前
But I show my face here if I want to betray you?

1084
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:56,215
-你是瞎了嗎  -是的  我是瞎了
- Are you blind?  - Yes, I was blind.

1085
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:58,715
他一直想要的
It's my head

1086
01:35:58,923 --> 01:36:01,527
是我的頭  他想讓我死
he's wanted all along. It's me.

1087
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,298
隨後就有了這次襲擊
That snick is after.

1088
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,527
這個政府
This government!

1089
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:08,506
這座城市
This city!

1090
01:36:10,381 --> 01:36:11,527
聽著
Now listen.

1091
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:15,173
-戰爭即將到來  -我知道
- War is bringing. - I know.

1092
01:36:16,006 --> 01:36:17,465
我知道
I know.

1093
01:36:20,381 --> 01:36:22,777
那麼宣誓對我效忠吧
Then swear your loyalty to me.

1094
01:36:24,965 --> 01:36:26,735
向國家宣誓  快
To the Empire. Do it.

1095
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,944
要麼譴責他  要麼滾出去
Condemn him or get out.

1096
01:36:38,923 --> 01:36:40,277
我會這麼做的
I will do it

1097
01:36:41,319 --> 01:36:43,923
如果有必要  我甚至會跪下來
On my knees, if necessary.

1098
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:46,319
而且不只如此
And not only that.

1099
01:36:47,152 --> 01:36:49,206
幾天之內  我可以召集其他省的主教
In a few days I can gather other

1100
01:36:49,207 --> 01:36:52,152
和沙漠裡的修道士們來對抗西裡爾
bishops from province and monks from desert all against Cyril.

1101
01:37:03,506 --> 01:37:05,381
但首先我要問你個問題
First I must ask you a question.

1102
01:37:06,631 --> 01:37:08,923
俄瑞斯忒斯  你相信耶穌嗎
Orestes, do you believe in Jesus?

1103
01:37:10,069 --> 01:37:10,798
你問我什麼
Do I what?

1104
01:37:11,006 --> 01:37:12,777
-你相信耶穌嗎  -你問我什麼
- Do you believe in Jesus? - Do I what!

1105
01:37:12,985 --> 01:37:14,652
你到底是真正的基督徒
Are you a true Christian

1106
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:17,777
還是你像那些寥寥眾生  僅僅臣服於
or did you like so many others, only convert

1107
01:37:18,298 --> 01:37:20,173
-自己的政治生涯  -辛奈西斯
- prospering politics? - Synesius.

1108
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:21,840
你為什麼不下跪
Why didn't you kneel?

1109
01:37:22,048 --> 01:37:23,819
-我有什麼選擇  -你為什麼不下跪
- What choice did I have? - Why didn't you kneel?

1110
01:37:24,027 --> 01:37:25,381
我還有什麼選擇
What choice did I have?

1111
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,506
背叛希帕蒂婭
Betray Hypatia?

1112
01:37:29,548 --> 01:37:31,006
譴責她嗎
Condemn her?

1113
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:32,465
你會那麼做嗎
Would you have done that?

1114
01:37:32,673 --> 01:37:34,444
我絕不會冒犯上帝的
I would never offend God.

1115
01:37:34,548 --> 01:37:37,569
是他  是他冒犯了上帝
It was he. He is offending God. He is offending him.

1116
01:37:37,777 --> 01:37:39,451
他在歪曲聖經
He is twisting...

1117
01:37:39,452 --> 01:37:41,735
他在曲解聖經的意思
Twisting...is what he is using the Scripture ...

1118
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,902
他只是在宣讀聖經
He read what is written.

1119
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:49,860
有多少女人可以對你發號施令
How many women do you obey?

1120
01:37:51,006 --> 01:37:52,360
多少個
How many?

1121
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:55,485
你仰慕同時又能聽你傾訴的女人有幾個
How many do you admire and listen to you?

1122
01:37:57,881 --> 01:37:59,027
只有
Only

1123
01:37:59,444 --> 01:38:00,590
一個
one.

1124
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,006
只有一個
Only one.

1125
01:38:06,527 --> 01:38:07,777
聖經
The Scripture ...

1126
01:38:08,402 --> 01:38:10,590
聖經是正確的
The Scripture is correct

1127
01:38:12,881 --> 01:38:14,860
只是由於在他的手中
and it was in his hands.

1128
01:38:17,152 --> 01:38:18,923
兄弟  你還不明白嗎
Brother, don't you see?

1129
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:21,423
你不明白你那樣做是在眾人面前
Don't you see the insult to God

1130
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:25,485
侮辱上帝嗎
in front of everyone?

1131
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:31,527
我不知道
I do not know ...

1132
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:36,319
我不知道該相信什麼
I do not know what I believe...

1133
01:38:36,527 --> 01:38:37,881
你必須告訴他
You have to tell him.

1134
01:38:38,298 --> 01:38:40,039
別跟我說  俄瑞斯忒斯
Don't tell me now, Orestes.

1135
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,110
告訴上帝你相信聖經
Tell him you believe in what is written.

1136
01:38:42,152 --> 01:38:44,652
-我信奉  -別跟我說  去跟他說
- I believe... - Don't tell me. Tell Him

1137
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:48,194
告訴上帝
Tell God.

1138
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:49,965
跪下
Kneel!

1139
01:38:52,569 --> 01:38:53,923
跪下
Kneel!

1140
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:17,896
許多人至今都記得
Many are those who remember

1141
01:39:17,897 --> 01:39:20,694
我們摯愛的兄長曾創造的奇跡
today the miracles of our beloved brother performed in life.

1142
01:39:23,715 --> 01:39:26,735
比如那次他將自己托付給聖父
Like the time he commanded himself to the Father and threw himself

1143
01:39:26,944 --> 01:39:29,548
踏過火堆卻毫髮無損
into the fire and wasn't even singed.

1144
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:32,152
阿摩尼阿斯
Ammonius

1145
01:39:33,506 --> 01:39:36,840
因為英勇捍衛對基督的信仰而獻身
Dead for bravely defending your faith in Christ,

1146
01:39:39,548 --> 01:39:41,735
我追封你為
I proclaimed you a motter,

1147
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,965
聖徒
a saint.

1148
01:39:49,652 --> 01:39:52,465
從此以後你將會被人們稱為
From now on you shall be known as

1149
01:39:52,673 --> 01:39:54,965
聖圖梅西斯
Saint Taumasius.

1150
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:09,652
我們要討回公道
We want justice!

1151
01:40:09,756 --> 01:40:12,152
公道
Justice!

1152
01:40:16,631 --> 01:40:18,194
願上帝指引我們  我親愛的
May God show us the way, my dear

1153
01:40:18,402 --> 01:40:21,215
聖戰士們  我言盡於此
parabolan, little else can I say to you.

1154
01:40:28,402 --> 01:40:30,173
尼帝亞的修道士有多少
What about monks of Nitria?

1155
01:40:30,381 --> 01:40:33,194
他們至少有500人  而且
Count to at least 500 of them. Plus

1156
01:40:33,298 --> 01:40:35,173
我們還有500人
500 of our men?

1157
01:40:35,381 --> 01:40:37,985
你以為這就夠了嗎  他可是地區提督
You think that's enough. He's the prefect!

1158
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,069
都有的軍隊都會保衛他
He has a whole army to protect him.

1159
01:40:40,173 --> 01:40:41,319
聽著
Listen!

1160
01:40:41,944 --> 01:40:44,652
我們何不找個簡單又有效的方法
Why don't we do something much more simple and effective?

1161
01:40:44,756 --> 01:40:46,110
你指的是什麼
What do you talking about?

1162
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,235
我們可以傷害他最關心的東西
We can hurt what worries him the most

1163
01:40:51,006 --> 01:40:52,048
如何
How?

1164
01:40:52,465 --> 01:40:54,340
-那個婊子  -誰啊
- That whore. - Who?

1165
01:40:55,694 --> 01:40:59,652
如果我們敢於面對世界的本相會怎樣
What if we dared to look at the world just as it is

1166
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:04,027
我們先摒棄那些先入為主的想法
Let's shed for a moment every preconceived ideas.

1167
01:41:04,131 --> 01:41:07,152
它會是什麼形狀  什麼形狀
What shape would it show us? What shape.

1168
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,902
你曾說過問題在於太陽體積的不一致
You once said the problem lies in the inconsistency of the sun.

1169
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:12,985
沒錯  我說過  很好  說清楚一點
Yes I did, good...good. Put it into words.

1170
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:18,819
太陽一定要在中心  因為我們繞著它旋轉
The sun must be at the center since we revolve around it.

1171
01:41:19,131 --> 01:41:20,277
與此同時
And at the same time

1172
01:41:20,485 --> 01:41:23,923
它又在其他位置  因為它離我們時遠時近
another position since our distance from it varies.

1173
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:25,902
-沒錯  正是如此  -怎麼會
- Yes, exactly. - How?

1174
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:31,431
它是如何同時佔據兩個位置的
How could it occupy two position at once?

1175
01:41:33,819 --> 01:41:36,319
它是如何同時佔據兩個位置的
How could it occupy two positions?

1176
01:41:37,465 --> 01:41:39,548
怎麼同時佔據兩個位置的
How could occupy two position at once?

1177
01:41:41,319 --> 01:41:43,923
怎麼同時佔據兩個位置的
How could occupy two positions?

1178
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:02,465
亞斯巴修
Aspasius...

1179
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:21,006
沒錯  沒錯  就是那兒  另一個放在這兒
Yes, yes. There. And the other one here.

1180
01:42:21,215 --> 01:42:23,194
保持相同的比例
Keep the same proportion.

1181
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,340
很好  把那端栓在火炬上
Good, very good. Now tie this end to that torch.

1182
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:37,777
亞斯巴修
Aspasius

1183
01:42:38,506 --> 01:42:40,694
我要你把這個想像成是地球
I want you to imagine that this is the Earth

1184
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,697
每把火炬代表
and the each of flames represent

1185
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:45,277
它距離太陽的兩個極限位置
the two extreme positions of the sun in relation to it:

1186
01:42:45,485 --> 01:42:47,048
也就是冬天和夏天
in winter and in summer.

1187
01:42:47,881 --> 01:42:52,048
如果這兩個位置都是同一個圓
What would happen if both of the positions were the two centers

1188
01:42:52,569 --> 01:42:53,923
的圓心會是什麼樣
of one in the same circle

1189
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:56,631
這是不可能的  主人
But it is impossible, mistress.

1190
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,212
等等  圓是什麼
Wait, what do we know about a circle?

1191
01:42:58,214 --> 01:42:59,548
我們知道圓心
We know that the center of the circle

1192
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:02,465
到圓周上任一點的距離總是相等
is always same distance to any point along its perimeter.

1193
01:43:02,673 --> 01:43:03,715
-沒錯  -是的
- Exactly. - Yes.

1194
01:43:03,923 --> 01:43:05,485
那如果我們把這個圓心分成兩個呢
What if I divide the center into two

1195
01:43:06,215 --> 01:43:07,777
讓圓周上的點到
but what I keep constant is

1196
01:43:07,778 --> 01:43:10,902
這兩個圓心的距離之和保持不變
the sum of there two distances to their perimeter

1197
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:16,527
好吧  我給你演示一下  看著  當我沿著
Okay, I'll show you. Watch. As I move this rod along

1198
01:43:16,735 --> 01:43:18,923
這個圓周移動棒子  繩子的一部分增加時
the court, as one segment increases

1199
01:43:19,131 --> 01:43:21,319
另一部分就會減少  反之亦然
the other segment decreases. And vice versa.

1200
01:43:22,465 --> 01:43:24,548
因此兩者之和
Therefore the sum of the two is always

1201
01:43:24,756 --> 01:43:26,735
保持不變  你明白了嗎
gong to beconstant. You see that?

1202
01:43:27,985 --> 01:43:31,527
如果我們把這個理論運用到
Now what if we apply this to the movement of

1203
01:43:32,777 --> 01:43:33,923
地球的移動之上呢
the Earth?

1204
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:49,235
我們會
What...

1205
01:43:52,256 --> 01:43:53,715
得到
figure

1206
01:43:54,131 --> 01:43:56,215
什麼圖形呢
will be...obtained ?

1207
01:43:59,965 --> 01:44:01,215
一個橢圓軌道
An ellipse!

1208
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:05,590
太陽在它的一個焦點之上
With the sun at one of its foci.

1209
01:44:07,569 --> 01:44:08,715
因為
Because,

1210
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:11,110
這種橢圓軌道
what is the circle execept

1211
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:13,298
除了它的焦點太近以至於
the very special ellipse

1212
01:44:13,506 --> 01:44:17,152
看上去似乎合二為一了  還能是什麼別的
whose foci have jonted so close together that they appear to be one

1213
01:44:22,152 --> 01:44:24,340
或許只是異想天開而已  亞斯巴修
Perhaps I'm completely raving, Aspasius.

1214
01:44:24,548 --> 01:44:27,985
為什麼非這樣不可  也許我只是
I mean really why should this be so? Maybe I'm just .. ..

1215
01:44:28,506 --> 01:44:29,965
也許我
Maybe I'm...

1216
01:44:40,277 --> 01:44:41,735
你怎麼看
What do you think?

1217
01:44:47,777 --> 01:44:49,652
很可能就是這樣的  主人
It could very be so, mistress.

1218
01:44:59,548 --> 01:45:02,465
太好了  我們明天再繼續
Right, well, we will continue with this tomorrow.

1219
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,652
去休息吧
Get some sleep.

1220
01:45:04,756 --> 01:45:06,215
-晚安  主人  -晚安
- Good night, mistress. - Good night.

1221
01:45:08,506 --> 01:45:09,652
謝謝你
Thank you.

1222
01:46:21,944 --> 01:46:22,985
達烏斯
Davus!

1223
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:27,673
達烏斯
Davus!

1224
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,402
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

1225
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,985
老師
Lady.

1226
01:46:59,652 --> 01:47:01,215
讓我看看
Let me see.

1227
01:47:02,256 --> 01:47:03,923
你去那邊坐下吧
Why do not you sit down?

1228
01:47:07,673 --> 01:47:09,131
大家都去哪了
Where is everybody?

1229
01:47:09,235 --> 01:47:10,798
請坐
Please sit down.

1230
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,881
我有
I have...

1231
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:14,756
我也有消息要告訴你
I have news for you, too.

1232
01:47:23,194 --> 01:47:24,548
所有的已經皈依
All dignitaries

1233
01:47:24,965 --> 01:47:27,048
基督教的官員們
who yet embraced to Christian faith

1234
01:47:27,256 --> 01:47:29,235
將要在公眾面前
are to be baptized

1235
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:31,735
接受洗禮
in public.

1236
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:37,777
目的非常明確
The aim is very clear:

1237
01:47:37,985 --> 01:47:42,569
為了增加擁護者  使市裡所有的基督徒
to add to our course. All the Christians in the city,

1238
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:47,256
以及正派人士們
decent folk, prepare to

1239
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:49,756
都為我盡忠
fight for me.

1240
01:47:52,152 --> 01:47:54,131
你指的是宣揚信仰嗎
You speak of peddling faith.

1241
01:48:00,381 --> 01:48:01,527
好吧
Okay.

1242
01:48:03,819 --> 01:48:04,860
非常好
Very well.

1243
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,225
既然所有的事都已成定局
Since everything seems to be decided already,

1244
01:48:09,267 --> 01:48:12,152
我不懂你還讓我來這裡做什麼
I didn't understand why you required my presence here.

1245
01:48:27,881 --> 01:48:29,860
我又不是政府的一員
I'm not a member of the government.

1246
01:48:30,277 --> 01:48:33,923
你不是  但你更重要  你是我最信任的人
No, you're more than that. You are the person that I trust most,

1247
01:48:34,131 --> 01:48:35,277
眾人皆知
and everyone knows it.

1248
01:48:35,485 --> 01:48:37,360
你在說什麼
What you are saying?

1249
01:48:45,902 --> 01:48:46,944
老師
Lady.

1250
01:48:50,277 --> 01:48:51,840
很多年前
Years ago...

1251
01:48:54,131 --> 01:48:56,319
很多年前你教導我們
Years ago you taught us something.

1252
01:48:57,569 --> 01:48:58,610
如果
If...

1253
01:48:59,131 --> 01:49:03,090
等同於同量的量
If two are equal to a third,

1254
01:49:03,298 --> 01:49:05,485
彼此相等  還記得嗎
they are all equal to each other. Do you remember?

1255
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:06,527
是的
Yes.

1256
01:49:06,631 --> 01:49:09,444
我們三個  我們都是好人
The three of us, we are all good people!

1257
01:49:09,548 --> 01:49:12,985
所以  你和我們一樣都是虔誠的基督徒
And you... you are as Christian as we are!

1258
01:49:17,777 --> 01:49:20,694
辛奈西斯  你對你的信仰深信不疑
Synesius, you don't question what you believe.

1259
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,444
但我不能
I can not.

1260
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:29,340
我必須懷疑
I must.

1261
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,298
那真是太遺憾了
That's a pity,

1262
01:49:43,506 --> 01:49:44,652
老師
Lady.

1263

莫大的遺憾
A great pity.

1264
01:49:48,194 --> 01:49:50,381
我們所尊敬的老師

1265
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:53,298
竟然背棄了自己曾教給過我們的東西
take it away from what she has herself taught us.

1266
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:57,048
你以為我不知道你所執迷那些愚蠢的事...
Or do you think I'm not aware the insane thing that you're involved.

- Synesius! - The Earth revolves around the sun.

1268
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,506
接下來又會是什麼  老師
What next? Lady, what next?

1269
01:50:04,965 --> 01:50:06,631
求你讓我離開吧
I beg of you, just let me go.

1270
01:50:07,465 --> 01:50:08,923
讓我進去  讓我進去
Let me in! Let me in!

1271
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:11,631

- I need to speak to her! - A parabolans?

1272
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,756

1274

It's me. Davus. Davus! Get of it.

1275
01:50:21,423 --> 01:50:22,673

- Tell them who I am! - Do you know this man?

1276
01:50:22,881 --> 01:50:24,340
是的  你想幹嘛
Yes, what do you want?

1277
01:50:24,444 --> 01:50:27,048
我有話對她說  她在哪
I need to speak to her. Where is she?

1278
01:50:27,256 --> 01:50:29,756
-女主人不在家  -十萬火急  她在哪
- My Mistress is not here. - It is urgent! Where is she?

1279
01:50:32,048 --> 01:50:33,819
-哪裡  -她在提督宮殿裡
- Where? - The prefect palace!

1280
01:50:33,923 --> 01:50:36,631
-提督宮殿  -好  謝謝  快點滾
- The prefect palace. Yeah, thank you. -Get out of here.

1281
01:50:38,194 --> 01:50:39,235
那到底是誰
Who was that?

1282
01:50:40,902 --> 01:50:42,465
他以前是這兒的奴隸
He was a slave once .

1283
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:51,631
等等  求你  等一下  求你了

If you don't agree, I won't be able to protect you any longer.

1285

我也不能和你交往
...I won't be able to have dealings with you.

1286
01:51:11,944 --> 01:51:13,506
甚至不能和你打招呼
Or even greet you.

1287
01:51:16,423 --> 01:51:17,569
希帕蒂婭
Hypatia.

1288
01:51:19,131 --> 01:51:20,485
你還不明白嗎
Don't you see?

1289
01:51:21,423 --> 01:51:23,610
沒有你我活不下去的
I can not go on without you.

1290
01:51:24,965 --> 01:51:26,110
我不行
I can not.

1291
01:51:32,152 --> 01:51:34,235
沒有你我無法打敗西裡爾

1292
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:37,360
俄瑞斯忒斯
Oh, Orestes.

1293
01:51:43,819 --> 01:51:45,798

但我不需要你們的保護
But I do not need you.

1296
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:36,319
達烏斯!
Davus!

1297
01:52:39,131 --> 01:52:41,319
兄弟  你要去哪裡
Brother! Where are you going?

1298
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,985
我們找到她了

1299
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,715
婊子  快走
Whore, walk!

1300

快走  罪人

-婊子  -多神教的渣子

01:54:10,173 --> 01:54:11,319
妖女

1306
01:54:34,444 --> 01:54:36,006
把她扒光
Strip her naked!

1307
01:54:45,277 --> 01:54:46,319
站起來
Get up.

1308
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:52,881
就這樣  這樣上帝可以看清你的污穢  妖女
That's it .So the God can behold you in all your filthy, whore.

1309
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,444
看清你如何蠱惑提督  娼婦
the way you knock the prefect, whore...

1310
01:54:54,652 --> 01:54:56,527
異教徒

1311
01:54:57,256 --> 01:54:58,298
娼婦
Whore.

1312

看啊
Look,

1313
01:54:59,652 --> 01:55:00,798
她一點反應都沒有
She's not reacting.

1314
01:55:01,319 --> 01:55:04,340
把刀子插進她的皮膚她就叫得出來了
She's scream all right with the skin on a knife.

1315
01:55:05,069 --> 01:55:06,944
-有多少人有刀子  -不要這樣
- How many of you have a knife? - No

1316
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:13,298
不要讓不潔的血液玷污你們的雙手
Don't stain your hands with impure blood.

1317
01:55:15,902 --> 01:55:17,152
用石塊砸死她吧
Let's stone her!

1318
01:55:18,506 --> 01:55:20,485
-我們用石塊砸死這個妖女  -去找些石塊
- Let's stone this Witch! - Get some stones.

1319

1321
01:55:24,652 --> 01:55:26,840
我看著她
I'll stay with her.

1322
01:57:32,985 --> 01:57:34,235
她暈過去了
She fainted.

1323
01:58:05,798 --> 01:58:07,881
希帕蒂婭的屍體殘缺不全  留下的部分
The body of Hipatia was mutilated and the remains...

1324
01:58:07,881 --> 01:58:09,965
被拖去遊街  焚燒
...were dragged through the streets and burned in a fire.

1325
01:58:09,965 --> 01:58:12,048
俄瑞斯忒斯被永久性的放逐  而西裡爾
Orestes was outlawed forever and Cyril...

1326
01:58:12,048 --> 01:58:15,173
則掌握了亞歷山大的大權
...took control of the power in Alexandria.

1327
01:58:20,381 --> 01:58:23,506
不久之後  西裡爾被封為聖徒  教會聖士
Later, Cyril was declared a Saint and Doctor of the Church.

1328
01:58:28,715 --> 01:58:30,798
儘管希帕蒂婭的成果沒有被保存下來
Although not any of Hipatia works remains,

1329
01:58:30,798 --> 01:58:32,881
但她仍然被後人當作傑出的天文學家
it is known that she was an exceptional astronomer,

1330
01:58:32,881 --> 01:58:35,902
並且以對圓錐曲線的研究而著稱
well-known for the mathematical study of conical curves.

1331
01:58:41,215 --> 01:58:43,298
1200年後
One thousand, two hundred years later,

1332
01:58:43,298 --> 01:58:45,381
17世紀  天文學家約翰內斯·開普勒
in the 17th century, astronomer Johannes Kepler...

1333
01:58:45,381 --> 01:58:47,465
解釋了圓錐曲線之中的
...described that one of those curves,...

1334
01:58:47,465 --> 01:58:49,548
橢圓  正是它主宰著星球的運動軌跡
...the ellipse, governs the movement of the planets.
