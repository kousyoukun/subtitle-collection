1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,954
This is James Henry Trotter.

2
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:04,293
He lived with his mother and father
in a cosy little house by the sea.

3
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,343
Hey. I've got ya.

4
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,340
Happy birthday, darling.

5
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,137
Now, quickly. Blow them out
before the wind does.

6
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:13,136
Make a wish first.

7
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,404
It was a wonderful life.

8
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:25,437
They had each other,
and they had their dreams.

9
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:29,032
Look!
That cloud looks like a camel.

10
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,165
And that one over there
looks like a train engine.

11
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:40,123
Now, can you see the tallest
building in the world?

12
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,465
I can't find it.

13
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,721
Try looking at it another way.

14
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:56,891
I see it!

15
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:59,140
That's where we're going...

16
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:02,319
on a great ship that will
take us across the ocean.

17
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:05,524
And we'll go right to the top
of that building.

18
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,983
The three of us,
on top of the world.

19
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:12,411
Are there any kids there like me?

20
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:14,406
Hundreds of them.

21
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:17,251
It's a wonderful place,James.

22
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,289
A city where dreams come true.

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,459
Then, one day,
a terrible thing happened.

24
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:29,763
An angry rhinoceros
appeared out of nowhere...

25
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:33,845
and gobbled up
his poor mother and father.

26
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,427
Their troubles--
if they had any at all--

27
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,309
were over in 35 seconds flat.

28
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,445
But James's troubles
were just beginning.

29
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,444
For now, he lives here
with Aunt Sponge...

30
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,990
Get up, you lazy little bug.

31
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:53,987
and Aunt Spiker.

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,747
- You already wasted
four minutes of daylight.
- Look at him.

33
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:02,496
Lollygagging in dreamland when
there's so much work to be do.

34
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,341
Weeds to pull, wood to chop.

35
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:08,261
Work, work, work, work, work!

36
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:57,678
Wouldn't want one of those
nesting in your knickers.

37
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:03,479
I look and smell--
I do declare--

38
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,478
as lovely as a rose.

39
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,736
Just feast your eyes upon my face.

40
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:12,523
Observe my shapely nose.

41
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,782
Behold my heavenly, silky locks.

42
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:21,000
And if I take off
both my socks,

43
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:24,536
you'll see my dainty toes.

44
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,715
But don't forget,
my dearest Sponge,

45
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,967
how much your tummy shows.

46
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,898
You lazy bug!

47
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,984
- Who told you to stop working?
- I finished the wood.

48
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,196
A travel book? How dare
you even dream of leaving!

49
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,744
This is the only home
you'll ever have.

50
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,996
No one else would tolerate
a worthless little nothing like you.

51
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:07,420
Where did you get this? Where?

52
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,127
Father gave it to me.
He said we were to go there one day.

53
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:14,051
- Stupid, foolish man.
- Foolish man. Always dreaming.

54
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:17,176
- That's what got him killed.
- And your mother.

55
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:20,517
Had his head in the clouds instead
of looking where he was going!

56
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:25,729
- He never even saw that rhino coming.
- That rhino.

57
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:30,063
And the beast will get you, too,
if you don't behave.

58
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:33,689
Now get these stupid dreams
out of your head!

59
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,191
And get back to work!

60
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,549
Careful, Spongy. Wouldn't want
to ruin that girlish figure.

61
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,541
Oh, shut up.

62
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:57,136
- Yes?
- I've finished all of the chores.

63
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:01,470
What a coincidence.
We've finished all the dinner.

64
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,803
Oh, Sponge.
You're such a tease.

65
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:07,231
There's something special
waiting for you in the oven.

66
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:18,824
Oh, do let me guess.

67
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,952
They're not good enough for him.

68
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,412
What do you think this is?
Buckingham Palace?

69
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,459
Get out of our sight!

70
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:30,456
Go on!

71
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,168
Go on!

72
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:14,625
Hello there!
Where did you come from?

73
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:18,668
You know, you probably shouldn't
build your web up here in the window.

74
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:22,382
Spiker and Sponge might see you,
and they hate spiders.

75
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:27,143
I'll be your friend, though.

76
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,857
<i>My name is James</i>

77
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:36,488
<i>That's what Mother called me</i>

78
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:40,951
<i>My name is James</i>

79
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:44,322
<i>So it's always been</i>

80
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:49,909
<i>Sometimes I forget</i>

81
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:54,915
<i>When I'm lonely or afraid</i>

82
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,921
<i>Then I'll go inside my head</i>

83
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:05,388
<i>And look for James</i>

84
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:08,182
Here's something
I've never shown anyone.

85
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:18,196
<i>There's a city that I dreamed of</i>

86
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:23,111
<i>Very far from here</i>

87
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:27,950
<i>Very, very far away from here</i>

88
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:33,037
<i>Very far away</i>

89
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:37,674
<i>There are people in the city</i>

90
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:42,173
<i>And they're kind to me</i>

91
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:47,639
<i>But it's very, very far away
you know</i>

92
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,303
<i>Very far</i>

93
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:55,685
<i>They'll say, James, James</i>

94
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:58,863
<i>James, how are ya</i>

95
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:02,947
<i>Isn't it a lovely day</i>

96
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:08,369
<i>James, James, James</i>

97
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,242
<i>We're so glad you came here</i>

98
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,377
<i>Where we are</i>

99
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:21,002
<i>From so very, very, very far</i>

100
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:25,888
<i>My name is James</i>

101
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:30,057
<i>James, James</i>

102
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:47,570
Good night. Pleasant dreams.

103
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:58,007
Spider! Vermin! Oh, beast!

104
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:01,878
No! Wait!

105
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:05,636
- Spider!
- Wait! I'll get it! I'll get it!

106
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:09,306
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

107
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:12,479
Where is it?

108
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,569
Get it! Get it!

109
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,614
- Kill it.
- Get it! Get it!

110
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:26,323
Kill it!

111
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,911
You hit me in the face.
You hit me in the face!

112
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,958
Oh, do shut up!

113
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:45,798
Go on. Get out of here. Get as far away
from this place as you possibly can.

114
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,808
Oh, I wish I could.

115
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:50,886
What's stopping you?

116
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:54,348
Oh, don't be frightened,James.
I mean you no harm.

117
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:59,268
How'd you know my name?

118
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,900
I know more than just your name.

119
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:06,742
What would you say
if I were to tell you...

120
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:10,611
that the answer to all
your troubles is right here...

121
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,700
inside this little bag?

122
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:15,877
- Hey! That's my--
- Of course it is.

123
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:19,498
Go on,James. Have a look.

124
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,628
There's more magic
in them things...

125
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,961
than in all the rest
of the world put together.

126
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,461
But what are they?

127
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:30,593
- Crocodile tongues.
- Tongues?

128
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:34,268
One thousand long,
slimy crocodile tongues.

129
00:11:34,356 --> 00:11:38,187
Boiled in the skull of a dead witch
for 20 days and 20 nights.

130
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:41,728
Add the fingers of a young
monkey, the gizzard of a pig,

131
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:44,738
the beak of a parrot
and three spoonfuls of sugar.

132
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:48,823
Stew for a week,
and then let the moon...

133
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:51,118
do the rest.

134
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:54,955
Have 'em, and marvelous things
will happen.

135
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,914
Things even you never dreamt of.

136
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:01,622
- Like what?
- Well, like...

137
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:04,504
you'll never be miserable again.

138
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:09,303
And you are miserable,
aren't you,James?

139
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:11,301
You weren't meant to be, you know.

140
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,015
And that place you're dreamin' of,

141
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:16,773
it's not as far away as you think.

142
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:23,860
New York City!

143
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:27,897
And it'll be that much closer,
once you take the first step.

144
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:31,445
But how? This doesn't
make any sense.

145
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:33,697
Not up here, it doesn't.

146
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,079
The answers are in here,

147
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:39,123
and the magic is in here.

148
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:43,793
So,James, what'll it be?

149
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:55,977
Now listen to me,James. Don't let them
get away, because if they do,

150
00:12:56,063 --> 00:13:01,189
they'll work their magic on whoever
or whatever they meet first.

151
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:03,899
Understand?

152
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,195
Good.

153
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:22,001
What's going on out here?

154
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,015
No! No, wait!

155
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,845
Wait! No! No, wait!

156
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:47,646
Wait.Just a-- Wait.

157
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,611
Here he is.
Get up, you little worm!

158
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,821
- We sent you out here to kill a spider.
- Not to laze about.

159
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:56,582
I wasn't lazing about.
I tripped.

160
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,705
How dare you disagree with us!

161
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:00,950
Beat him, Sponge.

162
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,124
It's too early.

163
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:08,004
Well, that makes you
the luckiest boy alive.

164
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:10,584
Now come inside and get dressed.

165
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:15,430
Spiker, look! A peach.

166
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:19,385
- A what?
- A peach! There! On that branch.

167
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,273
Why, that old tree's never had so much
as a blossom on it, let alone a--

168
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,318
Well, I'll be blowed.

169
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,527
There really is a peach there.

170
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:31,569
A nice, big one too.

171
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,568
How can we get it?

172
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,490
- The boy.
- Now, you be a good little boy...

173
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,627
and climb up there and get that
peach for your dear aunties.

174
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:45,797
- Can we eat it?
- Of course we can. We'll share it.

175
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:48,919
Me and your Aunt Spiker!
Now start climbing.

176
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,047
- Wait!
- What? What? What?

177
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:54,546
It's-It's growing!

178
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:57,346
- The boy?
- No. The peach, you idiot!

179
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,345
Look!

180
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:04,640
- Come down.
- But I won't get hurt.

181
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:06,644
Climb down!

182
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:11,280
What a peach. What a peach!

183
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:13,904
Look, Spiker! It's still growing!

184
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:16,865
I'm not blind, you dolt.
I can see it myself.

185
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:22,115
Look at it go! It's a miracle!

186
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:26,746
It's coming down. Stand back!

187
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,046
My heavens! My--

188
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:49,936
Marvelous things will happen,
just like he said.

189
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,988
Shut up, you little grub.

190
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,991
This has nothing to do with you,
so just keep away from it.

191
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:02,448
Can you smell that, Spikey?
It smells delicious.

192
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,915
No!

193
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:08,586
It smells like money.

194
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:15,757
Roll up. Roll up.
See the giant peach.

195
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,841
The Eighth Wonder of the World.

196
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,973
Have your money ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,308
Chance of a lifetime.
Ten bob only.

198
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,443
No peeking at the peach! Have
your money ready, ladies and gentlemen.

199
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:30,521
In you go.

200
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:34,029
- Can we touch it?
- Touch it? You want to touch it?

201
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:37,984
- She'll be wanting to taste it next.
- Admission refused.

202
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,865
This child has too many
cheeky ideas. Go away!

203
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:44,208
- Quite right.
- Ooh, splendid.

204
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:47,620
A photographer.

205
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:51,123
- And another.
- Best side.

206
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:55,507
- Move on in.
- No cameras allowed.

207
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,804
Don't dawdle. Come along,
ladies and gentlemen!

208
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,642
- Sorry, Father. It'll cost you double.
- May God forgive you.

209
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,635
Thank you, Father.

210
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:05,564
Come along, children.
Last chance of the day.

211
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,902
Yoo-hoo! Come down here.

212
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,647
Yes, Auntie Sponge?

213
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,067
Ooh! You're all spiffed up.

214
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:21,115
I was hoping to play
with the children.

215
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,322
The children have gone.

216
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:28,669
But you can play with their garbage.

217
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,831
Garbage.

218
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,961
And don't even think
of going near our peach.

219
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,267
'Cause if you do, remember:
They never did catch that rhino.

220
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,470
No! Wait a moment! Wait!

221
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,458
'Ere, now. Where do you think
you're going, Yank?

222
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,259
I'm goin' stir crazy.
I gotta take a look around.

223
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,306
Plan our escape
from Spiker and Sponge.

224
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:48,639
Escape? To where? We'll all be
squashed, swatted, smooshed!

225
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,098
No one's going to smoosh you,
my dear boy.

226
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,944
- You're six feet long now.
- Bigger target.

227
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:58,479
Let the biddies come.
I'll take 'em both on.

228
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,609
I'm indefeatable.
I'm indivisible. I'm...

229
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,824
- Whoa!
- in trouble!

230
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,494
It's Spiker and Sponge!
They've found us!

231
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,955
Hello!

232
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,163
No, no, no. It's the lad
from the house. What's his name?

233
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,459
- Miserable tick.
- I thought it was " rotten little grub.''

234
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,006
No. That's what those
horrible aunts call him.

235
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,095
His real name is--
Well, it's-- uh, uh--

236
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,257
It's James.

237
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:28,885
Look what you've done now, miss.
Scared him to death.

238
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,351
Please! Don't eat me!

239
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,441
- Eat you?
- Hey, Glow-worm. Turn up your lights.

240
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,530
- I'm a vegetarian.
- I eat dirt.

241
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,525
No one will be eating you,James.

242
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:46,200
Nah. She'll just puncture your
head and suck out the brains.

243
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:50,202
- That I am saving for you.
- Whoa! Pretty fast, long legs.

244
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:54,545
Oh, such rude behaviour.

245
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,037
There's no need
to be frightened, dearie.

246
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,339
But you're enormous bugs!

247
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,253
Fascinating, isn't it?

248
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:05,176
We've all changed,
and so have you,James.

249
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:10,261
The old man-- the one who
gave me the green things--

250
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,429
he said marvelous things
would happen.

251
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,191
Did he say,
"marvelous pigs in satin''?

252
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:19,523
No, dear lady.
"Marvelous things will happen.''

253
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,365
Poor Glow-worm.
She's a little deaf.

254
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,905
I, however, have exquisite hearing.

255
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:27,152
Yeah? Well, listen to this.

256
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,584
Let's get outta here!

257
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:35,415
You mean leave the hill?
I can't! The rhino will get me.

258
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,581
Rhino?

259
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,581
I say, dear boy.

260
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,881
I've lived on this
miserable hill for decades.

261
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,879
There are no rhinoceri here.

262
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:48,715
Except for Sponge.
She's twice as big as a rhino, eh, kid?

263
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,060
And twice as dangerous.
My life hangs by a thread every day.

264
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:55,811
I've had to send all 300
of me children to safer pastures.

265
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,936
Hah! You think hiding
in solid rock is fun?

266
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,151
I can't even remember what fun is.

267
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:03,944
Well, that's just 'cause
you been stuck here too long.

268
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,078
Listen to me, kid. I know a place
that will refresh your memory.

269
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,282
<i>Bright lights
Big city</i>

270
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,580
<i>That's where we gotta go</i>

271
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,704
<i>Where the food is great
and the bugs are so pretty</i>

272
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,288
<i>I'd like to get my arms
around a hundred or so</i>

273
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:22,299
<i>I'd hug 'em, squeeze 'em
hold 'em tight</i>

274
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:24,342
<i>Sleep all day
Dance all night</i>

275
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:27,548
<i>I want the bright lights
and the big city</i>

276
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,638
<i>That's the life for me, yeah
That's the life for--</i>

277
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:35,511
<i>You little maggot
Have you never seen the moon</i>

278
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:39,520
<i>Gliding 'cross the western sky</i>

279
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,987
<i>A dead oak tree by the waterside</i>

280
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:48,236
<i>Putrid vapours rising</i>

281
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,163
That sounds lovely, dear.
I'm sure we all agree.

282
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,408
<i>But I prefer the sunshine</i>

283
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:59,333
<i>A little park right in
the centre of the town</i>

284
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:04,547
<i>Flowers everywhere
Children all around me, I'd love it</i>

285
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:08,385
<i>Landing on a baby's cheek so warm</i>

286
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:12,008
<i>- It's wonderful
- Wonderful</i>

287
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:16,146
<i>That's the life for me</i>

288
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,062
<i>That's the life for me</i>

289
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:24,315
<i>That's the life
That's the life for me</i>

290
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:30,865
<i>- Elegant conversation
- Bright lights, big city</i>

291
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:34,536
<i>- An elevated point of view
- That's where I'd go</i>

292
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:38,408
<i>- Intellectual stimulation
- Yeah, maybe for you.</i>

293
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:42,631
<i>And someone you love
to share it with you</i>

294
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:48,054
<i>It would be wonderful</i>

295
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,047
<i>Wonderful</i>

296
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,723
<i>- That's the life for me
- You call that a life?</i>

297
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:57,309
<i>- That's the life for me
- It's no pile of dirt.</i>

298
00:23:57,398 --> 00:23:59,889
<i>That's the life
That's the life</i>

299
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:03,981
<i>That's the life
That's the life for--</i>

300
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,229
Where are you hiding, boy?

301
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:09,526
Time to go make a pest of myself.

302
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:14,611
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.

303
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:17,742
Where are you,
you detestable little worm?

304
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:20,290
Not you. Me!

305
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:23,545
You better not be near our peach.

306
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,170
Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!

307
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,877
Spray us? They'll see the Yank up there
and come after us with a shovel.

308
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:32,380
- It happened to my brother.
- How awful.

309
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:36,306
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.

310
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:39,230
Shh! They'll hear us.

311
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:43,984
Yoo-hoo! Where are you, boy?

312
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:48,114
I think I hear a rhino out here.

313
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,733
Ahh. This'll be a snap.

314
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:58,491
Shh! I really do hear something.

315
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:08,416
Timber.

316
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:13,546
- What's that?
- Fasten your seat belts, kids.

317
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:17,476
Ahh! The car!

318
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,432
- We're turning!
- Wha-Wha-What have you done?

319
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:25,942
Start, start, you piece of junk.

320
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,904
It's the peach! Our peach!
We'll be killed!

321
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:45,122
Whoa! I'm falling head
over head over head!

322
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:10,858
Here, stomach! Here, stomach!
Here, stomach!

323
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,206
I'm gonna be sick.

324
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:32,126
Our peach!

325
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:45,222
Where are we?

326
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,890
Ow! Somebody pinched me.

327
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:50,608
Sorry. I thought
you were the spider.

328
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:53,153
Ouch! What was that?

329
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:55,649
Excuse. I thought
you were the centipede.

330
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:58,152
Hey, Glow-worm.
How about some light?

331
00:26:58,247 --> 00:27:01,117
I can't hear you, dear.
I'll have to put my light on.

332
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,825
Oh! Oh! This is
so "unladybug-like.''

333
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,965
Don't worry. I'll have you
right-side up in no time.

334
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,005
Thank you,James.

335
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:14,010
- Where are you going?
- To see where we've landed.

336
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:23,602
Whoa!

337
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:34,941
Oh, my!

338
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:37,157
Oh, my, my.

339
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:40,613
Oh, my achin' back.

340
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,912
Oh!

341
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,041
Fascinating, isn't it?

342
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:49,829
What? What's fascinating?
Tell me. Don't leave me dangling.

343
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:54,633
We're in the middle of the--
how do you say-- the big puddle?

344
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,466
Biggest puddle of them all,
angel fangs. The Atlantic Ocean.

345
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,013
Technically,
the Pacific is larger.

346
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:05,389
Well, that goes without saying.

347
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,141
But there is land in sight?

348
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:09,724
Nothing but blue skies
and clear waters.

349
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:13,653
- This is all your fault.
- Hey!

350
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,191
If it wasn't for me, we'd all
be Spiked and Sponged by now!

351
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:19,526
This old man
with his green things--

352
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,242
did he happen to speak
to where we are going?

353
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:26,578
No. All he said was
the answers would be right here.

354
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:31,495
My travel book!

355
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:35,007
And look! It's the peach!

356
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:38,759
We're going to New York City!

357
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,421
New York? They love me there!

358
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:45,267
Wonderful! They've got a whole park
full of leaves for you, Miss Ladybug.

359
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:48,272
- Central Park.
- And loads of dark hiding places.

360
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:50,683
- Nightclubs.
- And museums and concerts.

361
00:28:50,777 --> 00:28:53,694
- Not to mention Yankee Stadium.
- What about me?

362
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,531
Why, they've got miles and miles
of underground tunnels.

363
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:57,779
The subway!

364
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:01,034
My father says it's the place
where dreams come true.

365
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:04,571
<i>- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me</i>

366
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:08,249
<i>- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me</i>

367
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:11,207
<i>- That's the life
- That's the life</i>

368
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:12,756
<i>That's the life</i>

369
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:18,629
<i>That's the life for me</i>

370
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:21,391
New York it is, then.

371
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,597
Now, how do we get there?

372
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,973
- I'll get us there!
- You?

373
00:29:26,062 --> 00:29:29,597
Sure! I've sailed
all the five seas.

374
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:32,228
From the sun-drenched reefs
of Bora Bora...

375
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:36,234
to the icy shores of Tripoli.

376
00:29:36,323 --> 00:29:39,609
"Commodore Centipede,''
they used to call me.

377
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,610
- Seven.
- Huh?

378
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:43,743
There are seven seas,

379
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:48,160
and Tripoli is
in the subtropics, Commodore.

380
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:51,336
- Trim the sails!
- There are no sails.

381
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:54,043
- Stoke the engine!
- There are no engines.

382
00:29:54,132 --> 00:29:56,540
I can't work
with this miserable crew.

383
00:29:56,635 --> 00:30:00,050
Great! We're stuck here
until we shrivel up and die.

384
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,428
- Highly improbable.
- That's a relief.

385
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,638
We're far more likely to drown.

386
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:07,395
Oh, no!

387
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,853
I know! We could--

388
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:13,431
No. It's a stupid idea.

389
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:15,769
- Compared to what?
- Hey!

390
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:19,730
Well, we could fly out.

391
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:22,067
He's right. It's stupid.

392
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,070
How would you do it,James?

393
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:26,914
With the seagulls,
but we'll need string.

394
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:28,956
Oh. Well, I'll just go
to the stationer's...

395
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:31,201
and pick up some paper clips
while I'm at it.

396
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:35,127
I have string.
Miles of string.

397
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:38,466
And we'll need bait; bird bait.

398
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:42,336
Bird bait? Where do you expect
we're gonna find bird bait...

399
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,218
out here in the middle
of the-- the--

400
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:48,679
Oh, no! No, no!

401
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:52,140
Have you lost your minds?

402
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:54,190
They've lost their minds!

403
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:56,234
Anything but birds!

404
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,526
Don't worry. I'm right here.

405
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:00,523
- Now wiggle.
- No!

406
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,491
But they won't come
if you don't wiggle.

407
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:04,984
Exactly!
And you can't make me.

408
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,989
Oh, yeah?

409
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:14,083
Hey, no fair! Mockingbirds
munched me mother!

410
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:20,293
Here comes the first one.
Get ready to pull down there.

411
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:23,304
My sisters were swallowed
by swallows!

412
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,255
Pull!

413
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:37,312
It worked! I got one!

414
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,401
Shh! I hear teeth.

415
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:42,111
Great, big, gnashing teeth.

416
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,035
Sounds like a rhinoceros.

417
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,248
In the ocean?
Scientifically impossible.

418
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:52,499
I hear something too.

419
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,791
It's a school of tuna.

420
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,251
They're being sucked
into some sort of machine.

421
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,294
- What do you mean?
- Take a look.

422
00:32:04,598 --> 00:32:06,673
It's a giant shark!

423
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:14,142
It seems to have spotted us.

424
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:20,195
- What do we do? What do we do?
- The seagulls!

425
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,940
It's our only chance!

426
00:32:22,032 --> 00:32:26,112
It would take the whole flock and
then some. We'll never do it in time.

427
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:28,574
We'll use Miss Spider's web
for a net. Hurry!

428
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,371
Throw it here, dearie.

429
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:40,628
Wiggle, Mr Earthworm.
Our lives depend on it.

430
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:43,552
I can't! I'm all wiggled out.

431
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:48,257
Here. Let me help you.

432
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:53,510
Come and get it!
Get your fresh, hot wienie!

433
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,723
Come on, baby.

434
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:06,074
I got 'em! Hand me the loops!

435
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,069
- Hurry!
- Shake a leg, there.

436
00:33:08,163 --> 00:33:10,866
Keep your pants on.
I've only got 1 2 hands.

437
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:16,753
It's getting closer.

438
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:18,995
Seagulls, away!

439
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,555
- Oh, no!
- Oh, dear!

440
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,702
They're getting away!

441
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,459
Hop on,James!

442
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:58,117
Now, grab them!

443
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:05,925
Help!

444
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:13,179
Hooligans! Ruffians!

445
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:15,428
Degenerates!

446
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:24,939
- Come on, seagulls!
- Put your backs into it!

447
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:27,189
Shake your bloomin' tail feathers!

448
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:32,025
Good sharky. Nice sharky.

449
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,658
Sharky!

450
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,652
Hooray!

451
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,363
All right! Teach you to mess
with me, you overgrown sardine!

452
00:35:12,453 --> 00:35:15,027
I'm from Brooklyn.

453
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:19,869
Pure twaddle! Every bug on board
displayed extraordinary courage.

454
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:22,748
Why, did you see Miss Ladybug
risk life and wing...

455
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:25,378
to bash those brutes
on the snoot?

456
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:29,382
Well, they were being very rude.
I can't abide rudeness.

457
00:35:29,471 --> 00:35:31,380
We are all
forgetting something.

458
00:35:31,472 --> 00:35:35,008
Everything we did was part
of the brilliant plan of James.

459
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:38,969
It really did work, didn't it?

460
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:43,441
- I say three cheers for James. Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

461
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:45,234
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

462
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,191
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!

463
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:51,613
New York,

464
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:54,453
here we come!

465
00:36:12,223 --> 00:36:14,678
Whoever you are,
keep away from me! Keep away!

466
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:18,468
Mr Earthworm, it's me!

467
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:20,851
Oh,James!
Oh, thank goodness.

468
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:23,727
You mustn't frighten yourself
like this all the time.

469
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:26,688
- Why not?
- You'll make yourself sick.

470
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:31,072
When I had a problem, my mum and dad
would tell me to look at it another way.

471
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:34,942
How? First I was bird bait.
Then I was shark bait.

472
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:39,117
I suppose. Or you could say
you gave us wings to fly...

473
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:42,708
and defeated a giant shark
single-handedly.

474
00:36:42,795 --> 00:36:46,495
- No-handedly.
- Exactly. You're a hero.

475
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:50,672
I am? I'm Wonder Worm!

476
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:52,718
You are.

477
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:06,808
Want food.

478
00:37:06,902 --> 00:37:08,812
Food.

479
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:15,566
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

480
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:18,118
I don't see how you can navigate
without a compass.

481
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:24,956
It's very hot up here.
I'm roasted.

482
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:42,269
- Unhand that bird!
- But I'm dyin' of hunger.

483
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:45,440
Well, perhaps I have a bit
of soda bread in here somewhere.

484
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:48,098
- Food?
- It's not much, but it's--

485
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:49,855
- Not so fast!
- Hey!
- You?

486
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:52,567
I need this food.
I have a much higher metabolism.

487
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:55,149
- Bite me!
- What?
- Have you two gone mad?

488
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:57,235
Let go of it, gramps!

489
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,322
- Give it! Give it to me!
- Let go of my coat!
- Give it to me!

490
00:37:59,414 --> 00:38:01,537
- Ow! My lower thorax.
- I'll rip you apart!

491
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,950
- I tell you, it's mine!
- Give it back!

492
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:10,296
Now look what you've done!

493
00:38:10,383 --> 00:38:14,333
We're going to starve.
Waste away. And not quickly.

494
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:18,427
Oh, no. That would be
the easy way out. We'll linger.

495
00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:21,720
Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.

496
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:25,014
Nobody's going to starve.

497
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:29,150
Don't you see? We have enough
food here for five voyages.

498
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:31,857
- Food? Where?
- Is there really food?
- What are you talkin' about?

499
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:33,904
Our whole ship is made of food.

500
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,442
Oh, such a clever little boy.

501
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:38,947
Takes after me.

502
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:41,444
After you,
there is nothing left to take.

503
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,366
Delectable!

504
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:47,875
- Better than aphids.
- Better than ladybugs.

505
00:38:47,963 --> 00:38:50,039
- What?
- Excuse.

506
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:53,964
It's not dirt, but it's not bad.

507
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:57,255
"Not bad''? It's the best thing
I've ever tasted,

508
00:38:57,347 --> 00:39:00,348
and I have tasted a lot.

509
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:12,103
<i>I've eaten many strange
and scrumptious dishes in my time</i>

510
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:14,865
<i>Like chilli bugs
and curried slugs</i>

511
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:17,819
<i>And earwigs
cooked in slime</i>

512
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,662
<i>And mice with rice
is very nice</i>

513
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:23,996
<i>When they're roasted
in their prime</i>

514
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:28,579
<i>But don't forget to sprinkle them
with just a pinch of grime</i>

515
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:38,093
<i>I'm crazy 'bout mosquitos
on a piece of buttered toast</i>

516
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:41,798
<i>And pickled spines of porcupines
and then a great, big roast</i>

517
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:43,850
<i>And dragon's flesh
Quite old, not fresh</i>

518
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:46,474
<i>It costs a buck at most</i>

519
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:49,186
Does it come with gravy?

520
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:52,608
<i>It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post</i>

521
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:06,200
<i>It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post</i>

522
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,410
<i>For dinner on my birthday</i>

523
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:10,874
<i>Shall I tell you
what I chose</i>

524
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:15,875
<i>Hot noodles made of poodles
on a slice of garden hose</i>

525
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:18,541
<i>And a rather smelly jelly</i>

526
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:21,306
<i>Made of armadillos' toes</i>

527
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,716
<i>The jelly is delicious</i>

528
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,938
<i>But you have to hold
your nose</i>

529
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:31,356
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

530
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:34,278
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

531
00:40:34,362 --> 00:40:37,732
<i>I crave the tasty tentacles
of octopi for tea</i>

532
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:42,949
<i>I like hot dogs but I love hot frogs
and surely you'll agree</i>

533
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:46,952
<i>A plate of soil with engine oil's
a super recipe</i>

534
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,711
<i>Recipe</i>

535
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:52,286
<i>I hardly need to mention
that it's practically free</i>

536
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,953
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

537
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:58,133
<i>Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach</i>

538
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:03,130
<i>We hardly need to mention
that it's practically free</i>

539
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:07,970
<i>Now comes, my fellow travelers
the burden of my speech</i>

540
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:12,475
<i>- You show-off!
- These foods are rare, beyond compare</i>

541
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:15,853
<i>And some right out of reach</i>

542
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:17,902
Nice aim, Commodore.

543
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,823
<i>But there's no doubt
I'd go without</i>

544
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:24,528
<i>A million plates of each</i>

545
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:26,578
Out of my face!

546
00:41:26,665 --> 00:41:29,582
<i>- For one small mite
- One small mite</i>

547
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:31,660
<i>One tiny bite</i>

548
00:41:31,753 --> 00:41:41,505
<i>Tiny bite
of this fantastic peach</i>

549
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:44,597
<i>- Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Stop! Stop!</i>

550
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:47,353
<i>- Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Wha-Wha-Wha-What's going on?</i>

551
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:50,852
- Bull's-eye!
- Comin' at you!
- Watch this!

552
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,896
<i>This fantastic peach</i>

553
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:23,547
You keep to yourself, don't you?

554
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,046
I prefer to be alone.

555
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:29,142
I was alone
for a long time once.

556
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:32,562
I think it's much nicer
to have friends. Don't you?

557
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:34,605
I would not know.

558
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:39,187
They would be your friends too-- the
others, I mean-- if you'd just let them.

559
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:42,197
No. It is in their nature
to have fear of me.

560
00:42:42,282 --> 00:42:46,115
- This I cannot change.
- You're very kind to me.

561
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:51,079
Maybe this is because
you are kind to me first.

562
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,623
You were the spider in my window!

563
00:42:55,464 --> 00:42:57,621
You were my first friend.

564
00:42:57,715 --> 00:43:01,166
I mean, since I went
to live with my aunts.

565
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,507
- They hated me!
- Shh! Do not think of them now.

566
00:43:05,597 --> 00:43:07,507
But what if they find us?

567
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:10,268
What if we don't make it
to New York?

568
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:14,979
I'll die if I have to go back to
the way I was! They can't make me!

569
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:20,522
Nobody can make you do anything,
James, if you do not let them.

570
00:43:20,612 --> 00:43:23,947
You are a brave boy.

571
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:26,441
Now, to sleep.

572
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:29,573
You have had
a very tired-making day.

573
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:12,698
Look! The little maggot's
stuffing his face with our peach!

574
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,247
Get him, Sponge.

575
00:44:16,712 --> 00:44:19,416
You can't crawl away from us!

576
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,303
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.

577
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:41,183
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.

578
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,227
The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you.

579
00:44:45,323 --> 00:44:48,028
The rhino will get you!

580
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,188
This is an outrage!

581
00:45:20,276 --> 00:45:23,976
You are a disgrace to your phylum,
class, order, genus and species!

582
00:45:24,071 --> 00:45:26,858
- Say it in English!
- You, sir, are an ass!

583
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:29,737
Where are we?
What's going on?

584
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:33,659
I found this dime-store Timmy
asleep at the helm.

585
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:36,073
- Now we're lost.
- We are not lost!

586
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,409
- Then where are we?
- Somewhere north!

587
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,411
Or possibly
very, very far south.

588
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,913
What's your latitude?
What's your longitude?

589
00:45:43,008 --> 00:45:45,842
Hey, hey, hey!
That's personal, bub.

590
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:49,758
- You said you could navigate!
- You said you'd traveled the world.

591
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,887
You said you'd been to Bora Bora.

592
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:56,767
- Well, not Bora Bora, per se. Uh--
- What about the shores of Tripoli?

593
00:45:56,855 --> 00:46:00,934
Did I say "Tripoli''?
I meant the halls of Montezuma.

594
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,018
- That's what you said.
- Never have I heard such mendacity!

595
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,353
- You liar.
- Charlatan!
- Wait!

596
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:08,946
If he says he's seen the world,
then he's seen the world.

597
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,988
Right, Mr Centipede?
Right?

598
00:46:12,078 --> 00:46:17,238
<i>Well, I did used to live between
two pages of a National Geographic.</i>

599
00:46:17,332 --> 00:46:22,624
<i>-Huh?
-Very informative magazine, the National
Geographic. Wonderful pictures.</i>

600
00:46:22,714 --> 00:46:27,624
You incompetent,
blithering nitwit!

601
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,838
All right, hoppy!
Them's fightin' words!

602
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:34,049
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Come on! Give me your best shot!

603
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,222
Whoa! Good shot.
Did you see what he did to me?

604
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:43,600
Hmph! Serves ya right.

605
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:47,477
- What do we do now? Which way do we go?
- Oh, it's simple, really.

606
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,564
All we need to do
is determine our coordinates,

607
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:52,658
then use triangulation to chart
a direct route to New York.

608
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,737
- Then there's hope.
- Don't be ridiculous.

609
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,163
There's no hope at all.
We don't have a compass.

610
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,207
We'll never reach New York.

611
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,333
We're gonna be stuck here forever.

612
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:05,173
We're gonna be frozen
like living statues.

613
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:07,416
Dead living statues.

614
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:09,964
No dark hiding places.

615
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:13,054
No cosy leaf in the park.

616
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,600
No city where dreams come true.

617
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:20,390
- Don't ships have compasses?
- No doubt.

618
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:25,226
But to brave those icy waters
would mean certain death.

619
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:27,276
Only a fool would do it.

620
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:32,190
Geronimo!

621
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:34,857
- What? What? What was that?
- The centipede jumped in!

622
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:38,155
Good heavens!
He's committed pesticide!

623
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:40,205
Oh, this is all my doing.

624
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:42,699
Don't take all the credit.
I helped too.

625
00:47:42,794 --> 00:47:46,875
- I have to go after him!
- Not on your life. You'll catch
your death of cold.

626
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:49,753
- But he's my friend!
-James is right.

627
00:47:49,843 --> 00:47:53,379
Centipede is one of us.
Get on my back. I am going with you.

628
00:47:53,472 --> 00:47:56,556
- You had better take good care of him.
- This I promise.

629
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:59,762
Stay by the line, and when
you feel two tugs, pull us up.

630
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:29,998
A skellington?

631
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:39,221
Jackpot! A genuine compass!

632
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:43,928
Sounds like you need
a little oil, Captain.

633
00:48:45,274 --> 00:48:48,359
Thank you, sir!
I'll be shovin' off now.

634
00:48:55,534 --> 00:48:57,861
I shoulda worn a belt!

635
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,832
Holy shipwreck!

636
00:49:18,557 --> 00:49:21,761
Listen, fellas. I got
a long history of back problems,

637
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:24,889
and I don't need it
to get any longer.

638
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:31,692
Hey. That one felt pretty good.

639
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,656
It's Paul Bunyan comin'
to cut me some slack.

640
00:49:36,743 --> 00:49:40,158
Whoa! Hey, pal.
You're aimin' a little low.

641
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:42,488
He's gonna cut me in half!

642
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:50,171
Hey, sailors!
Looking for some kicks?

643
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,258
Cut me loose!

644
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:03,343
Get the compass!

645
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:10,691
I've got it!

646
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:21,320
Gotcha!

647
00:50:22,706 --> 00:50:25,079
Polly want a smacker?

648
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:29,036
Look out!

649
00:50:31,965 --> 00:50:34,586
- Sounds like big trouble.
- Get ready to pull.

650
00:50:38,305 --> 00:50:42,635
I got a good one for ya. Why don't
skeletons play music in church?

651
00:51:02,453 --> 00:51:05,160
Oh. Thank goodness!
You're all right.

652
00:51:05,248 --> 00:51:07,787
- What happened to Centipede?
- He found a compass for us.

653
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:11,826
- And a shipload of pirates!
- Hold this. I am going back.

654
00:51:11,922 --> 00:51:14,211
Do be careful, Miss Spider.

655
00:51:22,516 --> 00:51:24,674
Poor Centipede.

656
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:27,640
He saved our lives down there.

657
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,687
- Look out!
- Miss Spider!

658
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:36,397
- Centipede!
- How am I lookin', kid?

659
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:41,946
Oh, Centipede. I do not know
whether to kill you or kiss you.

660
00:51:43,787 --> 00:51:46,540
- Well, I-- Say, I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

661
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:49,115
- My sincere apologies.
- I just, I just wanna apologize.

662
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,286
- I just wanted to say--
- What I'm tryin' to say--

663
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:53,620
That's enough chit-chat!
I'm freezing!

664
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:55,791
Hello? The compass is ready.

665
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:59,133
Mr Centipede, would you please
do us the honour...

666
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:01,545
of navigating us
out of this icebox?

667
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:03,797
It would be my pleasure.

668
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:05,848
I believe our position
puts us very close to--

669
00:52:05,935 --> 00:52:09,387
I admire your bravery,
Miss Spider. I really do.

670
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:12,232
Why, thank you, Mrs Ladybug.

671
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:15,353
All right, boys.
Coffee break's over.

672
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,951
I'm looking forward
to a hopping good time...

673
00:52:24,036 --> 00:52:26,658
in the Big Apple, Mr Centipede.

674
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:29,784
You said it, Mr Grasshopper.

675
00:52:37,926 --> 00:52:42,219
Oh, boy. What I wouldn't do
for a cup of coffee.

676
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:50,353
Cup of joe.

677
00:52:50,438 --> 00:52:53,890
I say, old sport. Came to
relieve you of your duties.

678
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:57,767
I said I'd steer the peach.
Have to steer the peach.

679
00:52:59,155 --> 00:53:03,023
- Can't quit now.
- Good show, old boy.

680
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:10,907
Thanks, Mr Grasshopper.

681
00:53:58,049 --> 00:54:01,500
- That music.
- Oh, Sir James! D-Did I disturb you?

682
00:54:01,594 --> 00:54:04,084
So sorry.
I-I-I-I'll put this away.

683
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:06,089
No, no! I like it.

684
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:10,096
I used to hear it at my aunts'
house before I went to sleep.

685
00:54:10,186 --> 00:54:12,142
That was you, wasn't it?

686
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:14,305
Or do all grasshoppers play music?

687
00:54:14,398 --> 00:54:17,766
All grasshoppers try.

688
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,818
I'm sure you've heard this.

689
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:26,785
Ghastly, isn't it? Cricket stuff.

690
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:31,281
- Music should be the voice of the soul.
- What does that mean?

691
00:54:31,373 --> 00:54:36,000
It means that when I'm happy,
my music sounds like this.

692
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:54,226
And when I'm sad,
it's like this.

693
00:55:04,573 --> 00:55:09,070
When I was sad, I used to climb
in bed with my mum and dad.

694
00:55:09,162 --> 00:55:12,079
But that was a long time ago.

695
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:15,285
I'm sure they'd be
very proud of you,James.

696
00:55:15,376 --> 00:55:17,914
I know we are.

697
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:30,345
<i>Take a little time</i>

698
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:32,675
<i>Just look at where we are</i>

699
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:35,011
<i>We've come very, very far</i>

700
00:55:35,105 --> 00:55:37,430
<i>Together</i>

701
00:55:37,524 --> 00:55:39,682
<i>And if I might say so</i>

702
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:42,350
<i>And if I might say so too</i>

703
00:55:42,446 --> 00:55:44,900
<i>We wouldn't have got anywhere</i>

704
00:55:44,989 --> 00:55:49,449
<i>If it weren't for you, boy</i>

705
00:55:49,535 --> 00:55:54,162
<i>Love is the sweetest thing</i>

706
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:58,792
<i>Love never comes
just when you think it will</i>

707
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:03,041
<i>Love is the way we feel for you</i>

708
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:05,090
<i>We're family</i>

709
00:56:05,177 --> 00:56:07,466
<i>We're family</i>

710
00:56:07,553 --> 00:56:09,843
<i>- We're family
- All of us</i>

711
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,089
<i>And you</i>

712
00:56:19,983 --> 00:56:22,189
<i>Think of where we'd be</i>

713
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,850
<i>- If we were on our own
- We'd be dead.</i>

714
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:29,193
<i>- You're what holds us all together
- I am?</i>

715
00:56:29,283 --> 00:56:31,443
<i>And if I might say so</i>

716
00:56:31,537 --> 00:56:34,241
<i>And if we might say so too</i>

717
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,573
<i>We never could love anyone</i>

718
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:39,750
<i>As much as we love you</i>

719
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:45,838
<i>- Love
- Is the strangest thing</i>

720
00:56:45,926 --> 00:56:47,753
<i>Love</i>

721
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:50,383
<i>Does exactly what
it wants to do</i>

722
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:54,553
<i>- Love
- Boy, ya know it's true</i>

723
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,552
<i>We're family</i>

724
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,685
<i>We're family</i>

725
00:56:58,772 --> 00:57:03,399
<i>We're family
Me, me, me, me, me and you</i>

726
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:07,105
<i>Ashes to ashes</i>

727
00:57:07,198 --> 00:57:09,770
<i>And dust to dust</i>

728
00:57:09,866 --> 00:57:15,537
<i>Without you
there'd be no "us''</i>

729
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:21,119
<i>Love is the sweetest thing</i>

730
00:57:21,211 --> 00:57:25,625
<i>Love does exactly what
it wants to do</i>

731
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:29,714
<i>Love is the way we feel for you</i>

732
00:57:29,803 --> 00:57:31,797
<i>We're family</i>

733
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:34,261
<i>We're family</i>

734
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,181
<i>We're family</i>

735
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,979
<i>Me</i>

736
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:43,813
<i>And you</i>

737
00:57:55,913 --> 00:57:58,202
We'll always be together, won't we?

738
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:01,125
Kid, you're stuck
with us for life.

739
00:58:07,008 --> 00:58:09,546
Look, everybody. We made it!

740
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:12,673
- We did?
- New York City.

741
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:14,802
- Breathtaking!
- Stunning!

742
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,930
- Oh, how glorious!
- Look at the park!

743
00:58:17,018 --> 00:58:19,509
- It's fabulous.
- We have made it!

744
00:58:19,603 --> 00:58:21,513
What a wonderful sight!

745
00:58:21,606 --> 00:58:23,979
There's Lady Liberty.

746
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:26,818
I can almost smell
the lovely dirt.

747
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:30,853
- Is it not beautiful?
- The Empire State Building!

748
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:34,364
See those lights! Wa-hoo!

749
00:58:34,453 --> 00:58:37,287
Yippee! Attaboy, Jimmy!

750
00:58:37,372 --> 00:58:41,155
Good show,James!
The city awaits us.

751
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:45,579
Now, remember,James. First
impression is very important.

752
00:58:58,225 --> 00:59:01,143
- Oh, no!
- We'll be blown off course!

753
00:59:01,229 --> 00:59:03,637
We'll wind up in Jersey!

754
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:11,986
- Could it be--
- No. It couldn't be.

755
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:17,779
- It's the rhino!
- Oh,James. Do something.

756
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,666
Everyone, climb up
into the rigging!

757
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:27,663
Hurry!

758
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:33,460
James, are you not
coming with us?

759
00:59:33,554 --> 00:59:36,922
No! It got
my mum and dad.

760
00:59:37,015 --> 00:59:40,218
It won't get my friends!

761
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:43,561
Come out and show your face,
you stupid beast!

762
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:54,026
Good God Almighty!

763
00:59:56,702 --> 01:00:00,534
Remember what
your parents said,James:

764
01:00:00,623 --> 01:00:05,202
"Try looking at it another way.''

765
01:00:05,294 --> 01:00:08,627
You're not even a real rhino!

766
01:00:08,713 --> 01:00:12,712
You're just a lot
of smoke and noise!

767
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:15,173
I'm not afraid of you!

768
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:29,733
I'm not afraid of you!

769
01:00:40,996 --> 01:00:43,831
James!

770
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:46,870
No!

771
01:01:19,994 --> 01:01:23,741
Miss Spider? Mr Grasshopper?

772
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:28,365
Hello? Is anyone there?

773
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:07,747
This isn't right.

774
01:02:07,835 --> 01:02:10,670
Where's the Empire State Building?

775
01:02:32,901 --> 01:02:35,060
What in the--

776
01:02:38,282 --> 01:02:42,065
Officer! There's a boy up there!

777
01:02:43,787 --> 01:02:45,696
What? A boy?

778
01:02:51,044 --> 01:02:53,963
Mabel, we got us a huge,
unidentified object here.

779
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:56,717
<i>- What's it look like?
- Round, fuzzy.</i>

780
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,373
<i>- It looks sorta like
a giant fruit or something.
- Well, what is it?</i>

781
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:03,930
I don't know what it is!Just send us
the biggest crane in New York!

782
01:03:21,075 --> 01:03:24,325
Please, sir. How do I get
to the Empire State Building?

783
01:03:24,412 --> 01:03:26,819
You're on top of it, kid.

784
01:03:26,914 --> 01:03:28,871
We made it!

785
01:03:32,627 --> 01:03:34,870
Well, I made it.

786
01:03:38,926 --> 01:03:40,835
Hang on.

787
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:49,260
Have you seen
any big bugs tonight?

788
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:51,678
Big bugs? How big?

789
01:03:57,779 --> 01:04:00,351
I hope they're all right.

790
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:20,543
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay back. Stay back.

791
01:04:27,975 --> 01:04:30,549
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be all right.

792
01:04:30,645 --> 01:04:32,934
Come on, sonny.
Don't be afraid, now. I got ya.

793
01:04:33,815 --> 01:04:36,222
Stay away from the fruit!

794
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:39,318
- Who's that? Hey!
- What is this thing?

795
01:04:39,403 --> 01:04:41,029
- Where you from?
- Why you here?
- Who?
- What?

796
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:43,735
- Where?
- When?
- Hold your fire, fellas!

797
01:04:43,824 --> 01:04:46,398
He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.
Here. I got you now.

798
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:51,114
It's okay, little guy.
Nobody's going to hurt ya.

799
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:53,330
Move back for them.

800
01:05:22,864 --> 01:05:25,023
No.

801
01:05:42,384 --> 01:05:44,460
Hello,

802
01:05:44,553 --> 01:05:48,467
little angel.

803
01:05:48,557 --> 01:05:52,388
So kind of you to look after
our little lost lamb.

804
01:05:54,229 --> 01:05:57,646
- Who are you?
- We are the boy's legal guardians.

805
01:05:57,733 --> 01:06:00,650
And we've missed him so much.

806
01:06:00,735 --> 01:06:02,646
So we'll just take him home now.

807
01:06:02,737 --> 01:06:05,573
And the peach, of course.
We're taking that as well.

808
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:08,231
Well, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Back up.

809
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:11,991
You mean to tell me that
this thing is a peach?

810
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,331
- It's not " a peach.'' It's our peach.
- Our peach.

811
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,375
- Show him, Spongy.
- Yes.

812
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:29,970
-Looks like it's their peach, all right.
-Yes.

813
01:06:30,057 --> 01:06:33,722
- Yes, and we're very proud of it.
- We're going to be in the record books.

814
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:36,848
It's not their peach.
The old man gave the green things to me.

815
01:06:36,938 --> 01:06:40,854
- That's what made it grow.
- How dare you disagree with us!

816
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:46,697
Patience, sister.
Remember his condition.

817
01:06:46,782 --> 01:06:49,190
- His condition?
- He's a chronic liar.

818
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:52,202
Sad, really.
He needs his treatment.

819
01:06:52,288 --> 01:06:54,744
Well, that's why we're here;
to bring him home.

820
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,201
So you come here with us,
eh, lovey!

821
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:02,544
I'm not the one who's lying.
They are!

822
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:07,293
As you can see, Officer, it is urgent
that you release him to us immediately.

823
01:07:07,386 --> 01:07:09,379
Let the boy speak!

824
01:07:09,472 --> 01:07:11,715
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Let the boy speak!

825
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:17,969
All right! All right! All right!
Let's get to the bottom of this.

826
01:07:18,063 --> 01:07:21,149
This thing is a peach.

827
01:07:21,234 --> 01:07:23,226
All right. I'll buy that.

828
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:26,071
Now, does somebody want
to tell me how it got here?

829
01:07:26,156 --> 01:07:28,362
We attached it
to a hundred seagulls.

830
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,905
Seagulls?

831
01:07:30,994 --> 01:07:32,452
That's what happened!

832
01:07:32,537 --> 01:07:36,155
Me and Miss Spider and the centipede
and the old green grasshopper.

833
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:39,085
I think he's gone mad.

834
01:07:39,169 --> 01:07:41,706
This is all something he dreamed up.

835
01:07:43,715 --> 01:07:49,171
Well, maybe it started that way,
as a dream, but doesn't everything?

836
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:53,592
Those buildings, these lights,
this whole city!

837
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:57,811
Somebody had to dream about it first,
and maybe that's what I did.

838
01:07:57,895 --> 01:08:00,684
I dreamed about coming here,
but then I did it.

839
01:08:00,774 --> 01:08:03,774
- The poor boy needs his medicine.
- Yes.

840
01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:06,979
- So we'll just take him--
- And the peach.

841
01:08:07,072 --> 01:08:10,571
back to our cosy, little house
on the hill.

842
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:13,446
Come along.
You're going home with us.

843
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:15,576
No, I'm not.

844
01:08:17,165 --> 01:08:18,576
What did you say?

845
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:23,293
I said, "No, I'm not!''

846
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:27,460
I hate that house and that cold room
and how I was always hungry.

847
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:29,460
All right! That's enough!

848
01:08:29,553 --> 01:08:34,049
- And how you beat me!
- He's lying!

849
01:08:34,141 --> 01:08:36,976
- And told me I was nothing!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

850
01:08:37,061 --> 01:08:39,729
- Shut up!
- No! Not this time.

851
01:08:41,565 --> 01:08:44,234
I flew the giant peach
across the ocean.

852
01:08:44,317 --> 01:08:47,901
I landed on top of the
tallest building in the world.

853
01:08:47,989 --> 01:08:51,571
I made it! I'm not the one
who's nothing. You are!

854
01:08:51,658 --> 01:08:55,787
And I'm never going back with you!
Not me, and not the peach.

855
01:08:55,871 --> 01:08:58,409
How dare you speak to us this way?

856
01:09:10,511 --> 01:09:12,634
James! Up here!

857
01:09:13,722 --> 01:09:16,723
Hello! We're here!

858
01:09:16,808 --> 01:09:19,763
- Hey, buddy!
- What are they?

859
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:23,638
- Young James.
- Hey,Jimmy!

860
01:09:23,732 --> 01:09:27,980
- Bugs!
- Need a little help down there?

861
01:09:28,071 --> 01:09:30,442
Giant bugs!

862
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:34,528
Hey, you old biddies!

863
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:36,741
- Help us!
- Whoo-ee! Here we are, dear.

864
01:09:36,829 --> 01:09:38,869
Hello,James!

865
01:09:38,956 --> 01:09:40,948
I told you they were real.

866
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:45,169
- Hello, old boy.
- Requesting clearance to land.

867
01:09:53,304 --> 01:09:55,547
Miss Spider, throw me a string.

868
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:04,973
Okay. Pull them up.

869
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,975
Help!

870
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:11,485
Where are we going?

871
01:10:13,574 --> 01:10:16,492
- Spin them around.
- You little--

872
01:10:19,247 --> 01:10:21,369
Wrap them tightly!

873
01:10:28,256 --> 01:10:31,755
Tighter! Tighter!

874
01:10:31,843 --> 01:10:34,132
Well, I'll be a--

875
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:36,177
The kid was tellin' the truth.

876
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:42,598
Get those two creeps outta here!

877
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:55,397
Stop the presses!
I got a new front page!

878
01:10:55,493 --> 01:10:57,817
"Big Bugs In The Big Apple.''

879
01:10:57,911 --> 01:11:01,778
In big, bold print: " A Little
Lindy Flies Giant Peach.''

880
01:11:01,873 --> 01:11:05,657
"Half-Pint Hero
And His Peach-Pit Pals.''

881
01:11:08,255 --> 01:11:11,255
Everyone, these are my friends;

882
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,299
the ones I've been telling you about.

883
01:11:13,385 --> 01:11:15,673
- Mr Centipede.
- Hi.

884
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:17,802
- Old green grasshopper.
- My pleasure.

885
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:20,974
- Earthworm. Mrs Ladybug.
- Charmed.

886
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:24,179
Miss Spider. And the glow-worm.

887
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:26,395
God bless the colonies.

888
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:31,484
- Could we eat some of your peach?
- It won't keep forever.

889
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,479
Go ahead.

890
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:45,989
Hey! What was your name?

891
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:48,041
It's James.

892
01:11:56,302 --> 01:12:00,466
They ate that peach
all the way down to the pit...

893
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:06,343
and set it up in Central Park
as a permanent home.

894
01:12:08,106 --> 01:12:10,680
And James Henry Trotter,

895
01:12:10,776 --> 01:12:14,358
who once was the saddest and loneliest
little boy you could find,

896
01:12:14,446 --> 01:12:17,530
now had a loving new family...

897
01:12:17,615 --> 01:12:20,154
and all the friends in the world.

898
01:12:20,243 --> 01:12:22,913
James, dinner is ready.

899
01:12:22,997 --> 01:12:25,369
All right. Nearly finished.

900
01:12:29,795 --> 01:12:33,710
And since James's visitors
begged him again and again...

901
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,084
to hear the story of his
adventure with the giant peach,

902
01:12:37,177 --> 01:12:40,014
he wished for a way
to share it with everyone.

903
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:46,803
And that is exactly
what you have just seen.

904
01:13:02,204 --> 01:13:06,152
<i>Once upon a time
there was a vulture and a hog</i>

905
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:09,582
<i>Livin' in a house
up on a hill</i>

906
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:14,081
<i>Had this little boy who lived with them
They worked him like a dog</i>

907
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:17,458
<i>With any luck
they'd have him up there still</i>

908
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:21,595
<i>'Long came a magic man
with a magic bag</i>

909
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:25,595
<i>Full of nasty little
green things in a funky old rag</i>

910
01:13:25,684 --> 01:13:29,600
<i>He said, Boy, you may not know it
but this here's salvation you see</i>

911
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:32,440
<i>Son, you're going down in history</i>

912
01:13:36,404 --> 01:13:38,693
<i>Good news is blowin' in your window</i>

913
01:13:40,408 --> 01:13:43,029
<i>Good news is knockin' on your door</i>

914
01:13:44,413 --> 01:13:46,903
<i>Good news is comin' 'round the corner</i>

915
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,699
<i>Good news is rollin' 'round your floor</i>

916
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:56,371
<i>Where can all my troubles be</i>

917
01:13:56,467 --> 01:14:00,381
<i>Must be good news chasin' me</i>

918
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:03,803
<i>Good enough to set everybody free</i>

919
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:08,054
<i>Good news, good news, good news</i>

920
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,889
<i>Good news</i>

921
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:14,060
<i>There were bugs in the garden
Didn't have a clue</i>

922
01:14:14,151 --> 01:14:17,851
<i>But every day
their life was on the line</i>

923
01:14:17,946 --> 01:14:21,990
<i>They wanted to get out of there
but they didn't know what to do</i>

924
01:14:22,075 --> 01:14:25,159
<i>Their little brains
was workin' overtime</i>

925
01:14:25,244 --> 01:14:30,406
<i>- Well
- That all changed one sunny day</i>

926
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:34,035
<i>That little boy dropped by to say</i>

927
01:14:34,128 --> 01:14:37,665
<i>If we all work together
we'll make out okay</i>

928
01:14:37,758 --> 01:14:41,969
<i>- We will
- Good news, good news, good news</i>

929
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:46,098
<i>So they rolled down the mountain
