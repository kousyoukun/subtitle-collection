NARRATOR:
This is James Henry Trotter.

3
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:07,608
He lived with his mother and father
in a cosy little house by the sea.

-Hey. I've got ya.

00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,654
Happy birthday, darling.

00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,449
Now, quickly. Blow them out
before the wind does.

7
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,451
Make a wish first.

NARRATOR: It was a wonderful life.

9
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,755
They had each other,
and they had their dreams.

10
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,341
Look!
That cloud looks like a camel.

11
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,472
And that one over there
looks like a train engine.

12
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,436
Now, can you see the tallest
building in the world?

13
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,776
I can't find it.

14
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,029
Try looking at it another way.

15
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,702
JAMES: I see it!

16
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,455
That's where we're going,

17
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,625
on a great ship that will
take us across the ocean.

18
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,836
And we'll go right to the top
of that building.

19
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,298
The three of us,
on top of the world.

20
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,718
Are there any kids there like me?

21
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,720
Hundreds of them.

22
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,556
It's a wonderful place, James.

23
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,601
A city where dreams come true.

24
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,772

(THUNDERING)

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,069
An angry rhinoceros

27

and gobbled up
his poor mother and father.

28
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,742
Their troubles,
if they had any at all,

29
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,869

...and Aunt Spiker.

36
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,012
You already wasted four minutes
of daylight.

37

as lovely as a rose.

44
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,043
Just feast your eyes upon my face.

45
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,796
Observe my shapely nose.

46
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:20,092
Behold my heavenly, silky locks.

47
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,388
And if I take off
both my socks,

48
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,682

you even dream of leaving!

This is the only home
you'll ever have.

58
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,223
No one else would tolerate
a worthless little nothing like you.

Where did you get this? Where?

60

And the beast will get you, too,
if you don't behave.

Yeah, maybe for you.

And someone you love
to share it with you

352
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,429
ALL: It would be wonderful

353
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,431
Wonderful

00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,683
That's the life for me

You call that a life?

356

That's the life for me

357
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,647
It's no pile of dirt.

Where are you hiding, boy?

00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,700
Hup! Time to go make a pest of myself.
Heh-heh!

362
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,997
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.

Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!

367
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,304
Spray us? They'll see the Yank up
there and come after us with a shovel.

00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,640
-It happened to my brother.
-How awful.

369
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,727
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.

00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,272
Shh. They'll hear us.

Hey, Glowworm.
How about some light?
