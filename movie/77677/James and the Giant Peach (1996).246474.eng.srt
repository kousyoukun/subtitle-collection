1
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,267
This is James Henry Trotter.

2
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:07,608
He lived with his mother and father
in a cosy little house by the sea.

3
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,652
Hey. I've got ya.

4
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,654
Happy birthday, darling.

5
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,449
Now, quickly. Blow them out
before the wind does.

6
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,451
Make a wish first.

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,709
It was a wonderful life.

8
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,755
They had each other,
and they had their dreams.

9
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,341
Look!
That cloud looks like a camel.

10
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,472
And that one over there
looks like a train engine.

11
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,436
Now, can you see the tallest
building in the world?

12
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,776
I can't find it.

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,029
Try looking at it another way.

14
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,702
I see it!

15
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,455
That's where we're going,

16
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,625
on a great ship that will
take us across the ocean.

17
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,836
And we'll go right to the top
of that building.

18
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,298
The three of us,
on top of the world.

19
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,718
Are there any kids there like me?

20
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,720
Hundreds of them.

21
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,556
It's a wonderful place, James.

22
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,601
A city where dreams come true.

23
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,772
Then, one day,
a terrible thing happened.

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,069
An angry rhinoceros
appeared out of nowhere

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,823
and gobbled up
his poor mother and father.

26
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,742
Their troubles,
if they had any at all,

27
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,620
were over in 35 seconds flat.

28
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,751
But James' troubles
were just beginning.

29
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,755
For now, he lives here
with Aunt Sponge...

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,508
Get up, you lazy little bug.

31
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,176
...and Aunt Spiker.

32
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,012
You already wasted four minutes
of daylight.

33
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,138
Look at him.

34
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:05,852
Lollygagging in dreamland when
there's so much work to do.

35
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,729
Weeds to pull, wood to chop.

36
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,649
Work, work, work, work, work!

37
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,990
Wouldn't want one of those
nesting in your knickers.

38
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,787
I look and smell,
I do declare,

39
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,789
as lovely as a rose.

40
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,043
Just feast your eyes upon my face.

41
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,796
Observe my shapely nose.

42
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:20,092
Behold my heavenly, silky locks.

43
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,388
And if I take off
both my socks,

44
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,850
you'll see my dainty toes.

45
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,020
But don't forget,
my dearest Sponge,

46
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,273
how much your tummy shows.

47
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,207
You lazy bug!

48
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,294
-Who told you to stop working?
-I finished the wood.

49
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,466
A travel book? How dare
you even dream of leaving!

50
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,052
This is the only home
you'll ever have.

51
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,223
No one else would tolerate
a worthless little nothing like you.

52
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,726
Where did you get this? Where?

53
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,437
Father gave it to me.
He said we were to go there one day.

54
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:17,400
-Stupid, foolish man.
-Foolish man. Always dreaming.

55
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,486
-That's what got him killed.
-And your mother.

56
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,823
Had his head in the clouds instead
of looking where he was going!

57
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:29,036
-He never even saw that rhino coming.
-That rhino.

58
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,374
And the beast will get you, too,
if you don't behave.

59
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,003
Now get these stupid dreams
out of your head!

60
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,505
-And get back to work!
-And get back to work!

61
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,893
Careful, Spongy. Wouldn't want
to ruin that girlish figure.

62
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,895
Oh, shut up.

63
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,443
-Yes?
-I've finished all of the chores.

64
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,780
What a coincidence.
We've finished all the dinner.

65
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,116
Oh, Sponge.
You're such a tease.

66
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,536
There's something special
waiting for you in the oven.

67
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,173
Oh, do let me guess.

68
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,258
They're not good enough for him.

69
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,719
What do you think this is?
Buckingham Palace?

70
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,766
Get out of our sight!

71
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,768
Go on!

72
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,479
Go on!

73
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,937
Hello, there!
Where did you come from?

74
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,982
You know, you probably shouldn't
build your web up here in the window.

75
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,694
Spiker and Sponge might see you,
and they hate spiders.

76
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,449
I'll be your friend, though.

77
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:35,162
My name is James

78
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:39,750
That's what Mother called me

79
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:44,255
My name is James

80
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,883
So it's always been

81
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,347
Sometimes I forget

82
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:58,394
When I'm lonely or afraid

83
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,315
Then I'll go inside my head

84
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,696
And look for James

85
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,490
Here's something
I've never shown anyone.

86
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:21,709
There's a city that I dreamed of

87
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,422
Very far from here

88
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:31,260
Very, very far away from here

89
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:36,515
Very far away

90
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,103
There are people in the city

91
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,482
And they're kind to me

92
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,030
But it's very, very far away
you know

93
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,741
Very far

94
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,079
They'll say, James, James

95
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,166
James, how are ya?

96
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,253
Isn't it a lovely day?

97
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,717
James, James, James

98
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,554
We're so glad you came here

99
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,723
Where we are

100
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:24,313
From so very, very, very far

101
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,068
My name is James

102
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:33,280
James, James

103
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,923
Good night. Pleasant dreams.

104
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,350
Spider! Vermin! Oh, beast!

105
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,979
No! Wait!

106
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,774
-Sponge!
-Wait! I'll get it! I'll get it!

107
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,778
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

108
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,322
Where is it?

109
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,957
Get it! Get it!

110
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,209
-Kill it.
-Get it! Get it!

111
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,920
-Kill it!
-Get it!

112
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,217
You hit me in the face.
You hit me in the face!

113
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,885
Oh, do shut up!

114
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:49,481
Go on. Get out of here. Get as far away
from this place as you possibly can.

115
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,318
Oh, I wish I could.

116
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,194
What's stopping you?

117
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,656
Oh, don't be frightened, James.
I mean you no harm.

118
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,578
How'd you know my name?

119
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,205
I know more than just your name.

120
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,710
What would you say
if I were to tell you

121
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,589
that the answer to all
your troubles is right here

122
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,008
inside this little bag?

123
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,094
-Hey! That's my...
-Of course it is.

124
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,806
Go on, James. Have a look.

125
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,934
There's more magic
in them things

126
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,270
than in all the rest
of the world put together.

127
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,856
But what are they?

128
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,068
-Crocodile tongues.
-Tongues?

129
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,571
One thousand long,
slimy crocodile tongues.

130
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,575
Boiled in the skull of a dead witch
for 20 days and 20 nights.

131
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,037
Add the fingers of a young monkey,
the gizzard of a pig,

132
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,956
the beak of a parrot
and three spoonfuls of sugar.

133
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,252
Stew for a week,
and then let the moon

134
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,421
do the rest.

135
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,258
Have 'em, and marvellous things
will happen.

136
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,345
Things even you never dreamt of.

137
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,099
-Like what?
-Well, like

138
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,810
you'll never be miserable again.

139
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,606
And you are miserable,
aren't you, James?

140
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,608
You weren't meant to be, you know.

141
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,319
And that place you're dreamin' of,

142
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,072
it's not as far away as you think.

143
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,079
New York City!

144
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,250
And it'll be that much closer,
once you take the first step.

145
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,878
But how? This doesn't
make any sense.

146
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,005
Not up here, it doesn't.

147
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,383
The answers are in here,

148
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,594
and the magic is in here.

149
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,099
So, James, what'll it be?

150
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:59,445
Now listen to me, James. Don't let them
get away, because if they do,

151
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,616
they'll work their magic on whoever
or whatever they meet first.

152
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,453
Understand?

153
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,746
Good.

154
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,304
What's going on out here?

155
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,315
No! No, wait!

156
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,196
Wait! No! No, wait!

157
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,038
Wait. Just a... Wait.

158
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,916
Here he is.
Get up, you little worm!

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,211
-We sent you out here to kill a spider.
-Not to laze about.

160
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,880
I wasn't lazing about.
I tripped.

161
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,924
How dare you disagree with us?

162
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,176
Beat him, Sponge.

163
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,430
It's too early.

164
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,308
Well, that makes you
the luckiest boy alive.

165
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,852
Now come inside and get dressed.

166
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,941
Spiker, look! A peach.

167
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,945
-A what?
-A peach! There! On that branch.

168
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,866
Why, that old tree's never had so much
as a blossom on it, let alone a...

169
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,618
Well, I'll be blowed.

170
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,870
There really is a peach there.

171
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,873
A nice, big one, too.

172
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,875
How can we get it?

173
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,586
-The boy.
-The boy.

174
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,797
Now, you be a good little boy

175
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,842
and climb up there and get that
peach for your dear aunties.

176
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,096
-Can we eat it?
-Of course we can. We'll share it.

177
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,099
Me and your Aunt Spiker!
Now start climbing.

178
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,352
-Wait!
-What? What? What?

179
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,980
It's... It's growing!

180
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,983
-The boy?
-No. The peach, you idiot!

181
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,985
Look!

182
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,198
-Come down.
-But I won't get hurt.

183
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,950
Climb down!

184
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,787
What a peach. What a peach!

185
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,249
Look, Spiker! It's still growing!

186
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,335
I'm not blind, you dolt.
I can see it myself.

187
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,424
Look at it go! It's a miracle!

188
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,927
It's coming down. Stand back!

189
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,347
My heavens! My...

190
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,285
Marvellous things will happen,
just like he said.

191
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,120
Shut up, you little grub.

192
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,999
This has nothing to do with you,
so just keep away from it.

193
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:05,714
Can you smell that, Spikey?
It smells delicious.

194
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,258
No!

195
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,928
It smells like money.

196
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,186
Roll up. Roll up.
See the giant peach.

197
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,188
The Eighth Wonder of the World.

198
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,315
Have your money ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

199
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,611
Chance of a lifetime.
Ten bob only.

200
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,154
No peeking at the peach!

201
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,740
Have your money ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

202
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,909
In you go.

203
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,496
-Can we touch it?
-Touch it? You want to touch it?

204
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,333
-She'll be wanting to taste it next.
-Admission refused.

205
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,169
This child has too many
cheeky ideas. Go away!

206
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,506
-Quite right.
-Oh, Sponge.

207
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,884
A photographer.

208
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,429
-And another.
-Best side.

209
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,809
-Move on in.
-No cameras allowed.

210
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,186
Don't dawdle. Come along,
ladies and gentlemen!

211
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,939
-Sorry, Father. It'll cost you double.
-May God forgive you.

212
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,857
Thank you, Father.

213
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,111
Come along, children.
Last chance of the day.

214
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,283
Yoo-hoo! Come down here.

215
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,995
Yes, Auntie Sponge?

216
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,498
You're all spiffed up.

217
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,501
I was hoping to play
with the children.

218
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,630
The children have gone.

219
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,717
But you can play with their garbage.

220
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,927
Garbage.

221
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,392
And don't even think
of going near our peach.

222
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,688
'Cause if you do, remember,
they never did catch that rhino.

223
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,766
No! Wait a moment! Wait!

224
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,764
'Ere, now. Where do you think
you're going, Yank?

225
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,559
I'm goin' stir crazy.
I gotta take a look around.

226
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,602
Plan our escape
from Spiker and Sponge.

227
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,940
Escape? To where? We'll all be
squashed, swatted, smooshed!

228
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,443
No one's going to smoosh you,
my dear boy.

229
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,238
-You're six feet long now.
-Bigger target.

230
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,825
Let the biddies come.
I'll take 'em both on.

231
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm indefeatable.
I'm indivisible. I'm...

232
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,080
-Whoa!
-...in trouble!

233
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,793
It's Spiker and Sponge!
They've found us!

234
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,254
Hello!

235
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,549
No, no, no. It's the lad
from the house. What's his name?

236
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,760
-Miserable tick.
-I thought it was "rotten little grub."

237
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,388
No. That's what those
horrible aunts call him.

238
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,433
His real name is...
Well, it's...

239
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,560
It's James.

240
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,188
Look what you've done now, miss.
Scared him to death.

241
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,691
Please! Don't eat me!

242
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,111
-Eat you?
-Hey, Glowworm. Turn up your lights.

243
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,825
-I'm a vegetarian.
-I eat dirt.

244
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,827
No one will be eating you, James.

245
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,497
Nah. She'll just puncture your
head and suck out the brains.

246
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,501
-That I am saving for you.
-Whoa! Pretty fast, long legs.

247
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,923
Oh, such rude behaviour.

248
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,342
There's no need
to be frightened, dearie.

249
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,761
But you're enormous bugs!

250
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,262
Fascinating, isn't it?

251
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,516
We've all changed,
and so have you, James.

252
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,647
The old man, the one who
gave me the green things,

253
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,815
he said marvellous things
would happen.

254
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,485
Did he say,
"marvellous pigs in satin"?

255
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,986
No, dear lady.

256
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,073
"Marvellous things will happen."

257
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,700
Poor Glowworm.
She's a little deaf.

258
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,411
I, however, have exquisite hearing.

259
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,664
Yeah? Well, listen to this.

260
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,876
Let's get outta here!

261
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,755
You mean leave the hill?
I can't! The rhino will get me.

262
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,091
Rhino?

263
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,801
I say, dear boy.

264
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,178
I've lived on this
miserable hill for decades.

265
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,180
There are no rhinoceri here.

266
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:51,810
Except for Sponge.
She's twice as big as a rhino, eh, kid?

267
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,397
And twice as dangerous.
My life hangs by a thread every day.

268
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,109
I've had to send all 300
of me children to safer pastures.

269
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,237
You think hiding
in solid rock is fun?

270
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,447
I can't even remember what fun is.

271
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,242
Well, that's just 'cause
you been stuck here too long.

272
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,329
Listen to me, kid. I know a place
that will refresh your memory.

273
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,833
Bright lights
Big city

274
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,085
That's where we gotta go

275
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,130
Where the food is great
and the bugs are so pretty

276
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,716
I'd like to get my arms
around a hundred or so

277
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,802
I'd hug 'em, squeeze 'em
hold 'em tight

278
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,846
Sleep all day
Dance all night

279
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,099
I want the bright lights
and the big city

280
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,145
That's the life for me, yeah
That's the life for...

281
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:39,024
You little maggot
Have you never seen the moon

282
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,028
Gliding 'cross the western sky

283
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:47,490
A dead oak tree by the waterside

284
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:51,745
Putrid vapours rising

285
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,583
That sounds lovely, dear.
I'm sure we all agree.

286
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,877
But I prefer the sunshine

287
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,714
A little park right in
the centre of the town

288
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,886
Flowers everywhere
Children all around me, I'd love it

289
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,723
Landing on a baby's cheek so warm

290
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,602
-It's wonderful, wonderful
-Wonderful

291
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:19,564
That's the life for me

292
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,359
That's the life for me

293
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:27,614
That's the life
That's the life for me

294
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:34,370
-Elegant conversation
-Bright lights, big city

295
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:38,041
-An elevated point of view
-That's where I'd go

296
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,918
Intellectual stimulation

297
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,795
Yeah, maybe for you.

298
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:46,007
And someone you love
to share it with you

299
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,429
It would be wonderful

300
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,431
Wonderful

301
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,683
That's the life for me

302
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,102
You call that a life?

303
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,270
That's the life for me

304
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,647
It's no pile of dirt.

305
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,358
That's the life
That's the life

306
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,403
That's the life
That's the life for...

307
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,073
Where are you hiding, boy?

308
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,700
Time to go make a pest of myself.

309
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,997
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.

310
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,167
Where are you,
you detestable little worm?

311
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,795
Not you. Me!

312
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,965
You better not be near our peach.

313
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,384
Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!

314
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,304
Spray us? They'll see the Yank up
there and come after us with a shovel.

315
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,640
-It happened to my brother.
-How awful.

316
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,727
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.

317
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,647
They'll hear us.

318
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,402
Yoo-hoo! Where are you, boy?

319
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,573
I think I hear a rhino out here.

320
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,077
This'll be a snap.

321
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,334
I really do hear something.

322
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,801
Timber.

323
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,848
-What's that?
-Fasten your seat belts, kids.

324
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,768
The car!

325
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:24,189
-We're turning!
-What have you done?

326
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,319
Start, start, you piece of junk.

327
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,580
It's the peach! Our peach!
We'll be killed!

328
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,296
Whoa! I'm falling head
over head over head!

329
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,280
Here, stomach! Here, stomach!
Here, stomach!

330
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,583
I'm gonna be sick.

331
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,385
Our peach!

332
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,276
Somebody pinched me.

333
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,028
Sorry. I thought
you were the Spider.

334
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,447
What was that?

335
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,950
Excuse. I thought
you were the Centipede.

336
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,452
Hey, Glowworm.
How about some light?

337
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,414
I can't hear you, dear.
I'll have to put my light on.

338
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,167
This is so "unladybug-like."

339
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:12,255
Don't worry. I'll have you
right-side up in no time.

340
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,299
Thank you, James.

341
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,302
-Where are you going?
-To see where we've landed.

342
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,185
Whoa!

343
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,072
Oh, my!

344
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,450
Oh, my, my.

345
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,536
Oh, my achin' back.

346
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,459
Fascinating, isn't it?

347
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:53,004
What? What's fascinating?
Tell me. Don't leave me dangling.

348
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:57,967
We're in the middle of the...
How do you say, the big puddle?

349
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:02,764
Biggest puddle of them all,
angel fangs. The Atlantic Ocean.

350
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,516
Technically,
the Pacific is larger.

351
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,686
Well, that goes without saying.

352
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,355
But there is land in sight?

353
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,274
Nothing but blue skies
and clear waters.

354
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,986
-This is all your fault.
-Hey!

355
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,531
If it wasn't for me, we'd all
be Spiked and Sponged by now!

356
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,867
This old man
with his green things,

357
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,536
did he happen to speak
to where we are going?

358
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:29,832
No. All he said was
the answers would be right here.

359
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,796
My travel book!

360
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,298
And look! It's the peach!

361
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,260
We're going to New York City!

362
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,764
New York? They love me there!

363
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,643
Wonderful! They've got a whole park
full of leaves for you, Miss Ladybug.

364
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,687
-Central Park.
-And loads of dark hiding places.

365
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,065
-Nightclubs.
-And museums and concerts.

366
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,151
-Not to mention Yankee Stadium.
-What about me?

367
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,821
Why, they've got miles and miles
of underground tunnels.

368
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,114
The subway!

369
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,325
My father says it's the place
where dreams come true.

370
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,037
-That's the life for me
-That's the life for me

371
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:11,791
-That's the life for me
-That's the life for me

372
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,544
-That's the life
-That's the life

373
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,087
That's the life

374
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:22,093
That's the life for me

375
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,846
New York it is, then.

376
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,098
Now, how do we get there?

377
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,475
-I'll get us there!
-You?

378
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,937
Sure! I've sailed
all the five seas.

379
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,606
From the sun-drenched reefs
of Bora-Bora

380
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:39,610
to the icy shores of Tripoli.

381
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,114
"Commodore Centipede,"
they used to call me.

382
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,074
Seven.

383
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,076
There are seven seas,

384
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:51,706
and Tripoli is
in the subtropics, Commodore.

385
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,709
-Trim the sails!
-There are no sails.

386
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,336
-Stoke the engine!
-There are no engines.

387
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,964
I can't work
with this miserable crew.

388
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,509
Great! We're stuck here
until we shrivel up and die.

389
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,887
-Highly improbable.
-That's a relief.

390
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,097
We're far more likely to drown.

391
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,266
Oh, no!

392
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,312
I know! We could...

393
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,814
No. It's a stupid idea.

394
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,108
-Compared to what?
-Hey!

395
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,778
Well, we could fly out.

396
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,448
He's right. It's stupid.

397
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,450
How would you do it, James?

398
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,286
With the seagulls,
but we'll need string.

399
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,330
Well, I'll just go
to the stationer's

400
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,624
and pick up some paper clips
while I'm at it.

401
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:38,669
I have string.
Miles of string.

402
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,881
And we'll need bait, bird bait.

403
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,635
Bird bait? Where do you expect
we're gonna find bird bait

404
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,638
out here in the middle of the... The...

405
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,933
Oh, no! No, no!

406
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,893
Have you lost your minds?

407
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,438
They've lost their minds!

408
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,607
Anything but birds!

409
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,193
Don't worry. I'm right here.

410
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,778
-Now wiggle.
-No!

411
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,905
But they won't come
if you don't wiggle.

412
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,366
Exactly!
And you can't make me.

413
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,451
-Oh, yeah?
-Stop!

414
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,458
Hey, no fair! Mockingbirds
munched me mother!

415
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,756
Here comes the first one.
Get ready to pull down there.

416
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,759
My sisters were swallowed
by swallows!

417
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,595
Pull!

418
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,439
It worked! I got one!

419
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,733
I hear teeth.

420
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,486
Great, big, gnashing teeth.

421
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,322
Sounds like a rhinoceros.

422
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:52,410
In the ocean?
Scientifically impossible.

423
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,663
I hear something, too.

424
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,082
It's a school of tuna.

425
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,585
They're being sucked
into some sort of machine.

426
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,671
-What do you mean?
-Take a look.

427
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,011
It's a giant shark!

428
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,767
It seems to have spotted us.

429
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,566
-What do we do? What do we do?
-The seagulls!

430
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,026
It's our only chance!

431
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,614
It would take the whole flock and
then some. We'll never do it in time.

432
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,074
We'll use Miss Spider's web
for a net. Hurry!

433
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,705
Throw it here, dearie.

434
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,961
Wiggle, Mr Earthworm.
Our lives depend on it.

435
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,881
I can't! I'm all wiggled out.

436
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,636
Here. Let me help you.

437
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,891
Come and get it!
Get your fresh, hot wienie!

438
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,063
Come on, baby.

439
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,152
I got 'em! Hand me the loops!

440
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,322
-Hurry!
-Shake a leg, there.

441
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,408
Keep your pants on.
I've only got 12 hands.

442
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,955
It's getting closer.

443
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,208
Seagulls, away!

444
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,934
-Oh, no!
-Oh, dear!

445
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,033
They're getting away!

446
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,077
Hop on, James!

447
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,330
Now, grab them!

448
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,586
Help!

449
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,387
Hooligans! Ruffians!

450
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,056
Degenerates!

451
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,315
-Come on, seagulls!
-Put your backs into it!

452
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,776
Shake your bloomin' tail feathers!

453
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,406
Good sharky. Nice sharky.

454
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,578
Sharky!

455
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,774
Hooray!

456
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:15,738
All right! Teach you to mess
with me, you overgrown sardine!

457
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,407
I'm from Brooklyn.

458
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:23,245
Pure twaddle! Every bug on board
displayed extraordinary courage.

459
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,123
Why, did you see Miss Ladybug
risk life and wing

460
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,667
to bash those brutes
on the snoot?

461
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,755
Well, they were being very rude.
I can't abide rudeness.

462
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,632
We are all
forgetting something.

463
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,385
Everything we did was part
of the brilliant plan of James.

464
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,306
It really did work, didn't it?

465
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,894
-I say three cheers for James. Hip-hip.
-Hooray!

466
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,604
-Hip-hip.
-Hooray!

467
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,565
-Hip-hip.
-Hooray!

468
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,985
New York,

469
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,822
here we come!

470
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,008
Whoever you are,
keep away from me! Keep away!

471
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,846
Mr Earthworm, it's me!

472
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,181
Oh, James!
Oh, thank goodness.

473
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,017
You mustn't frighten yourself
like this all the time.

474
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,020
-Why not?
-You'll make yourself sick.

475
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,480
When I had a problem,

476
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,483
my mum and dad
would tell me to look at it another way.

477
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:38,404
How? First I was bird bait.
Then I was shark bait.

478
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:42,491
I suppose. Or you could say
you gave us wings to fly

479
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:46,036
and defeated a giant shark
single-handedly.

480
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,915
-No-handedly.
-Exactly. You're a hero.

481
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,044
I am? I'm Wonder Worm!

482
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,088
You are.

483
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,102
Want food.

484
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,104
Food.

485
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,861
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

486
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,614
I don't see how you can navigate
without a compass.

487
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,287
It's very hot up here.
I'm roasted.

488
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,679
-Unhand that bird!
-But I'm dyin' of hunger.

489
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,849
Perhaps I have a bit
of soda bread in here somewhere.

490
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,018
-Food?
-It's not much,

491
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,186
-but it's...
-Not so fast!

492
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,270
-Hey!
-You?

493
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,981
I need this food.
I have a much higher metabolism.

494
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,066
-Bite me!
-What?

495
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,609
Have you two gone mad?

496
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,611
Let go of it, gramps!

497
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,946
-Give it! Give it to me!
-Let go of my coat!

498
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,072
Give it to me!

499
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,823
-My lower thorax.
-I'll rip you apart!

500
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,242
-I tell you, it's mine!
-Give it back!

501
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,791
-Now look what you've done!
-Now look what you've done!

502
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,836
We're going to starve.
Waste away. And not quickly.

503
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,882
Oh, no. That would be
the easy way out. We'll linger.

504
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,135
Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.

505
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,805
Nobody's going to starve.

506
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:32,059
Don't you see? We have enough
food here for five voyages.

507
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,144
-Food? Where?
-Is there really food?

508
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,312
What are you talkin' about?

509
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,272
Our whole ship is made of food.

510
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:39,900
Oh, such a clever little boy.

511
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,111
Takes after me.

512
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,613
After you,
there is nothing left to take.

513
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,241
Delectable!

514
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,161
-Better than aphids.
-Better than ladybugs.

515
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,372
-What?
-Excuse.

516
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:57,292
It's not dirt, but it's not bad.

517
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,629
"Not bad"? It's the best thing
I've ever tasted,

518
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,716
and I have tasted a lot.

519
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,561
I've eaten many strange
and scrumptious dishes in my time

520
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,188
Like chilli bugs
and curried slugs

521
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,191
And earwigs
cooked in slime

522
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:24,028
And mice with rice
is very nice

523
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,364
When they're roasted
in their prime

524
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:31,952
But don't forget to sprinkle them
with just a pinch of grime

525
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,420
I'm crazy 'bout mosquitoes
on a piece of buttered toast

526
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,174
And pickled spines of porcupines
and then a great, big roast

527
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,217
And dragon's flesh
Quite old, not fresh

528
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,720
It costs a buck at most

529
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,431
Does it come with gravy?

530
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,976
It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post

531
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,490
It comes to you in barrels
if you order it by post

532
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,742
For dinner on my birthday

533
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,244
Shall I tell you
what I chose

534
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:19,249
Hot noodles made of poodles
on a slice of garden hose

535
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,044
And a rather smelly jelly

536
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,630
Made of armadillos' toes

537
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,091
The jelly is delicious

538
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:31,470
But you have to hold
your nose

539
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,723
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach

540
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,810
Peach, peach, peach, peach

541
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:41,021
I crave the tasty tentacles
of octopi for tea

542
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:46,318
I like hot dogs but I love hot frogs
and surely you'll agree

543
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:50,280
A plate of soil with engine oil's
a super recipe

544
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,950
Recipe

545
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,702
I hardly need to mention
that it's practically free

546
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,288
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach

547
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,375
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach

548
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:05,462
We hardly need to mention
that it's practically free

549
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:11,385
Now comes, my fellow travellers
the burden of my speech

550
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,761
You show-off!

551
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,806
These foods are rare, beyond compare

552
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,976
And some right out of reach

553
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,103
Nice aim, Commodore.

554
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,148
But there's no doubt
I'd go without

555
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,568
A million plates of each

556
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,862
Out of my face!

557
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,948
-For one small mite
-One small mite

558
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,950
One tiny bite

559
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:40,289
Tiny bite of this fantastic

560
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,959
Peach

561
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,670
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach

562
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,754
Stop! Stop!

563
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:48,839
Peach, peach, peach, peach

564
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,757
What's going on?

565
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,051
-Bull's-eye!
-Comin' at you!

566
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,178
Watch this!

567
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,263
This fantastic peach

568
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,877
You keep to yourself, don't you?

569
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,254
I prefer to be alone.

570
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,507
I was alone
for a long time once.

571
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,886
I think it's much nicer
to have friends. Don't you?

572
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,888
I would not know.

573
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:42,559
They would be your friends, too, the
others, I mean, if you'd just let them.

574
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:45,562
No. It is in their nature
to have fear of me.

575
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,441
-This I cannot change.
-You're very kind to me.

576
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:54,655
Maybe this is because
you are kind to me first.

577
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,199
You were the spider in my window!

578
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,953
You were my first friend.

579
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,539
I mean, since I went
to live with my aunts.

580
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:08,877
-They hated me!
-Do not think of them now.

581
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,671
But what if they find us?

582
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,423
What if we don't make it
to New York?

583
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:18,303
I'll die if I have to go back to
the way I was! They can't make me!

584
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:23,809
Nobody can make you do anything,
James, if you do not let them.

585
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,271
You are a brave boy.

586
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,773
Now, to sleep.

587
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,901
You have had
a very tired-making day.

588
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:16,028
Look! The little maggot's
stuffing his face with our peach!

589
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,405
Get him, Sponge.

590
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,743
You can't crawl away from us!

591
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:40,677
-The rhino will get you.
-The rhino will get you.

592
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,514
-The rhino will get you.
-The rhino will get you.

593
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,560
-The rhino will get you.
-The rhino will get you.

594
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,396
The rhino will get you.

595
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,470
This is an outrage!

596
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,349
You are a disgrace to your phylum,
class, order, genus and species!

597
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,102
-Say it in English!
-You, sir, are an ass!

598
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,063
Where are we?
What's going on?

599
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,983
I found this dime-store Timmy
asleep at the helm.

600
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,319
-Now we're lost.
-We are not lost!

601
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,863
-Then where are we?
-Somewhere north!

602
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,740
Or possibly
very, very far south.

603
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,243
What's your latitude?
What's your longitude?

604
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,246
Hey, hey, hey!
That's personal, bub.

605
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,083
-You said you could navigate!
-You said you'd travelled the world.

606
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,210
You said you'd been to Bora-Bora.

607
00:45:55,294 --> 00:46:00,173
-Well, not Bora-Bora, per se.
-What about the shores of Tripoli?

608
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:04,219
Did I say "Tripoli"?
I meant the halls of Montezuma.

609
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,388
-That's what you said.
-Never have I heard such mendacity!

610
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,597
-You liar.
-Charlatan!

611
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,723
Wait!

612
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,269
If he says he's seen the world,
then he's seen the world.

613
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,355
Right, Mr Centipede?
Right?

614
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,610
Well, I did used to live between
two pages of a National Geographic.

615
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,614
Very informative magazine,
the National Geographic.

616
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:25,907
Wonderful pictures.

617
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:30,787
You incompetent,
blithering nitwit!

618
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:34,124
All right, hoppy!
Them's fightin' words!

619
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,544
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Come on! Give me your best shot!

620
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:43,592
Whoa! Good shot.
Did you see what he did to me?

621
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,970
Serves ya right.

622
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,806
What do we do now?
Which way do we go?

623
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:50,849
Oh, it's simple, really.

624
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,726
All we need to do
is determine our coordinates,

625
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,937
then use triangulation to chart
a direct route to New York.

626
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,981
-Then there's hope.
-Don't be ridiculous.

627
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,485
There's no hope at all.
We don't have a compass.

628
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,528
We'll never reach New York.

629
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,572
We're gonna be stuck here forever.

630
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,492
We're gonna be frozen
like living statues.

631
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,827
Dead living statues.

632
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:13,246
No dark hiding places.

633
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,166
No cosy leaf in the park.

634
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,837
No city where dreams come true.

635
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,715
-Don't ships have compasses?
-No doubt.

636
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:28,512
But to brave those icy waters
would mean certain death.

637
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,597
Only a fool would do it.

638
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,227
Geronimo!

639
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,271
-What? What? What was that?
-The Centipede jumped in!

640
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,441
Good heavens!
He's committed pesticide!

641
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,527
Oh, this is all my doing.

642
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,112
Don't take all the credit.
I helped, too.

643
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,698
-I have to go after him!
-Not on your life.

644
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,200
You'll catch your death of cold.

645
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,078
-But he's my friend!
-James is right.

646
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:56,706
Centipede is one of us.
Get on my back. I am going with you.

647
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,876
-You had better take good care of him.
-This I promise.

648
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,129
Stay by the line, and when
you feel two tugs, pull us up.

649
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,326
A skellington?

650
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,544
Jackpot! A genuine compass!

651
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,257
Sounds like you need
a little oil, Captain.

652
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,678
Thank you, sir!
I'll be shovin' off now.

653
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,187
I shoulda worn a belt!

654
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,110
Holy shipwreck!

655
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:25,003
Listen, fellas. I got
a long history of back problems,

656
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,131
and I don't need it
to get any longer.

657
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,055
Hey. That one felt pretty good.

658
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:40,060
It's Paul Bunyan comin'
to cut me some slack.

659
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,480
Whoa! Hey, pal.
You're aimin' a little low.

660
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,857
He's gonna cut me in half!

661
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,573
Hey, sailors!
Looking for some kicks?

662
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,578
Cut me loose!

663
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,586
Get the compass!

664
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,052
I've got it!

665
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,771
Gotcha!

666
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,441
Polly want a smacker?

667
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,320
Look out!

668
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,951
-Sounds like big trouble.
-Get ready to pull.

669
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:45,583
I got a good one for ya. Why don't
skeletons play music in church?

670
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,254
'Cause they got no organs!

671
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,398
Thank goodness!
You're all right.

672
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,109
-What happened to Centipede?
-He found a compass for us.

673
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:15,113
-And a shipload of pirates!
-Hold this. I am going back.

674
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,490
Do be careful, Miss Spider.

675
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,917
Poor Centipede.

676
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,962
He saved our lives down there.

677
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,006
-Look out!
-Miss Spider!

678
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,679
-Centipede!
-How am I lookin', kid?

679
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:45,226
Oh, Centipede. I do not know
whether to kill you or kiss you.

680
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,898
-Well, I... Say, I'm sorry.
-Well, I'll say I'm sorry.

681
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,442
-My sincere apologies.
-I just, I just wanna apologise.

682
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,569
-I just wanted to say...
-What I'm tryin' to say...

683
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,946
That's enough chit-chat!
I'm freezing!

684
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,157
Hello? The compass is ready.

685
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,577
Mr Centipede, would you please
do us the honour

686
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,913
of navigating us
out of this icebox?

687
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,165
It would be my pleasure.

688
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,875
I believe our position
puts us very close to...

689
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,670
I admire your bravery,
Miss Spider. I really do.

690
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:15,799
Why, thank you, Mrs Ladybug.

691
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,885
All right, boys.
Coffee break's over.

692
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,310
I'm looking forward
to a hopping good time

693
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,146
in the Big Apple, Mr Centipede.

694
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:33,233
You said it, Mr Grasshopper.

695
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,703
Oh, boy. What I wouldn't do
for a cup of coffee.

696
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,127
Cup of joe.

697
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,215
I say, old sport. Came to
relieve you of your duties.

698
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,094
I said I'd steer the peach.
Have to steer the peach.

699
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:06,391
-Can't quit now.
-Good show, old boy.

700
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:14,399
Thanks, Mr Grasshopper.

701
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,866
-That music.
-Oh, Sir James! Did I disturb you?

702
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,368
So sorry.
I... I'll put this away.

703
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,579
No, no! I like it.

704
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,583
I used to hear it at my aunts'
house before I went to sleep.

705
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,460
That was you, wasn't it?

706
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,587
Or do all grasshoppers play music?

707
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,090
All grasshoppers try.

708
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,134
I'm sure you've heard this.

709
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,099
Ghastly, isn't it? Cricket stuff.

710
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,646
-Music should be the voice of the soul.
-What does that mean?

711
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:39,359
It means that when I'm happy,
my music sounds like this.

712
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,752
And when I'm sad,
it's like this.

713
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:12,308
When I was sad, I used to climb
in bed with my mum and dad.

714
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,436
But that was a long time ago.

715
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,648
I'm sure they'd be
very proud of you, James.

716
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,900
I know we are.

717
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,788
Take a little time

718
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,999
Just look at where we are

719
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,376
We've come very, very far

720
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,837
Together

721
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,964
And if I might say so

722
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,633
And if I might say so, too

723
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,261
We wouldn't have got anywhere

724
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,849
If it weren't for you, boy

725
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:57,520
Love is the sweetest thing

726
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:02,025
Love never comes
just when you think it will

727
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:06,154
Love is the way we feel for you

728
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,531
We're family

729
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,908
We're family

730
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,244
-We're family
-All of us

731
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,496
And you

732
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,548
Think of where we'd be

733
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,966
If we were on our own

734
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,051
We'd be dead.

735
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:31,345
You're what holds us all together

736
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,638
I am?

737
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,766
And if I might say so

738
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,560
And if we might say so, too

739
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,937
We never could love anyone

740
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,149
As much as we love you

741
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:49,197
-Love
-Is the strangest thing

742
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,990
Love

743
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,618
Does exactly what
it wants to do

744
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:57,663
-Love
-Boy, ya know it's true

745
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,916
We're family

746
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,126
We're family

747
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:06,839
We're family
Me, me, me, me, me and you

748
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,468
Ashes to ashes

749
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,096
And dust to dust

750
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:18,851
Without you
there'd be no "us"

751
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:24,482
Love is the sweetest thing

752
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:29,070
Love does exactly what
it wants to do

753
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:33,032
Love is the way we feel for you

754
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,118
We're family

755
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,662
We're family

756
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,457
We're family

757
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,251
Me

758
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:47,088
And you

759
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,477
We'll always be together, won't we?

760
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:04,397
Kid, you're stuck
with us for life.

761
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,822
Look, everybody. We made it!

762
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,950
-We did?
-New York City.

763
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,077
-Breathtaking!
-Stunning!

764
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,204
-Oh, how glorious!
-Look at the park!

765
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,790
-It's fabulous.
-We have made it!

766
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,042
What a wonderful sight!

767
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,253
There's Lady Liberty.

768
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,256
I can almost smell
the lovely dirt.

769
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,135
-Is it not beautiful?
-The Empire State Building!

770
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,638
See those lights!

771
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,558
Yippee! Attaboy, Jimmy!

772
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,478
Good show, James!
The city awaits us.

773
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:48,900
Now, remember, James. First
impression is very important.

774
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:04,498
-Oh, no!
-We'll be blown off course!

775
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,959
We'll wind up in Jersey!

776
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,176
-Could it be...
-No. It couldn't be.

777
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:21,057
-It's the rhino!
-Oh, James. Do something.

778
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,981
Everyone, climb up
into the rigging!

779
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,983
Hurry!

780
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,739
James, are you not
coming with us?

781
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:40,201
No! It got
my mum and dad.

782
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,371
It won't get my friends!

783
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,666
Come out and show your face,
you stupid beast!

784
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,301
Good God Almighty!

785
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:03,808
Remember what
your parents said, James.

786
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:08,479
"Try looking at it another way."

787
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,899
You're not even a real rhino!

788
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:15,945
You're just a lot
of smoke and noise!

789
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,614
I'm not afraid of you!

790
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:33,004
I'm not afraid of you!

791
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,101
James!

792
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,146
No!

793
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:27,058
Miss Spider? Mr Grasshopper?

794
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:31,645
Hello? Is anyone there?

795
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,018
This isn't right.

796
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:13,938
Where's the Empire State Building?

797
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,337
What in the...

798
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:45,344
Officer! There's a boy up there!

799
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,973
What? A boy?

800
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:57,273
Mabel, we got us a huge,
unidentified object here.

801
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,817
-What's it look like?
-Round, fuzzy.

802
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,610
It looks sorta like
a giant fruit or something.

803
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:02,736
Well, what is it?

804
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:07,032
I don't know what it is! Just send us
the biggest crane in New York!

805
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,928
Please, sir. How do I get
to the Empire State Building?

806
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:30,097
You're on top of it, kid.

807
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,141
We made it!

808
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,147
Well, I made it.

809
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:43,402
Hang on.

810
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,578
Have you seen
any big bugs tonight?

811
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,788
Big bugs? How big?

812
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,464
I hope they're all right.

813
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,776
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay back. Stay back.

814
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:33,869
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be all right.

815
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:36,038
Come on, sonny.
Don't be afraid, now. I got ya.

816
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,333
Stay away from the fruit!

817
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,545
-Who's that? Hey!
-What is this thing?

818
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,629
-Where you from?
-Why you here?

819
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,713
-Who?
-What?

820
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:45,881
-Where?
-When?

821
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:47,007
Hold your fire, fellas!

822
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,677
He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.
Here. I got you now.

823
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:54,390
It's okay, little guy.
Nobody's going to hurt ya.

824
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,600
Move back for them.

825
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,172
No.

826
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,776
Hello,

827
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:51,614
little angel.

828
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:55,868
So kind of you to look after
our little lost lamb.

829
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,914
-Who are you?
-We are the boy's legal guardians.

830
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:03,959
And we've missed him so much.

831
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:05,919
So we'll just take him home now.

832
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,006
And the peach, of course.
We're taking that as well.

833
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,550
Well, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Back up.

834
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:15,262
You mean to tell me that
this thing is a peach?

835
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:18,599
-It's not "a peach." It's our peach.
-Our peach.

836
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,643
-Show him, Spongy.
-Yes.

837
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,280
-Looks like it's their peach, all right.
-Yes.

838
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:37,076
-Yes, and we're very proud of it.
-We're going to be in the record books.

839
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,329
It's not their peach. The old man
gave the green things to me.

840
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:44,249
-That's what made it grow.
-How dare you disagree with us?

841
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:49,963
Patience, sister.
Remember his condition.

842
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,508
-His condition?
-He's a chronic liar.

843
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,469
Sad, really.
He needs his treatment.

844
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:58,013
Well, that's why we're here,
to bring him home.

845
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:01,475
So you come here with us,
eh, lovey!

846
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,813
I'm not the one who's lying.
They are!

847
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:10,693
As you can see, Officer, it is urgent
that you release him to us immediately.

848
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,653
Let the boy speak!

849
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,988
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Let the boy speak!

850
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:21,370
All right! All right! All right!
Let's get to the bottom of this.

851
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,415
This thing is a peach.

852
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,500
All right. I'll buy that.

853
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,628
Now, does somebody want
to tell me how it got here?

854
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,630
We attached it
to a hundred seagulls.

855
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,216
Seagulls?

856
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,634
That's what happened!

857
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:39,430
Me and Miss Spider and the Centipede
and the old green Grasshopper.

858
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,349
I think he's gone mad.

859
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:44,977
This is all something he dreamed up.

860
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:52,443
Well, maybe it started that way,
as a dream, but doesn't everything?

861
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:56,905
Those buildings, these lights,
this whole city!

862
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:01,076
Somebody had to dream about it first,
and maybe that's what I did.

863
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:03,954
I dreamed about coming here,
but then I did it.

864
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,082
-The poor boy needs his medicine.
-Yes.

865
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,252
-So we'll just take him...
-And the peach.

866
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,630
...back to our cosy, little house
on the hill.

867
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,759
Come along.
You're going home with us.

868
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,844
No, I'm not.

869
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,930
What did you say?

870
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:26,560
I said, "No, I'm not!"

871
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,731
I hate that house and that cold room
and how I was always hungry.

872
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,733
All right! That's enough!

873
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:37,321
-And how you beat me!
-He's lying!

874
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:38,781
And told me I was nothing!

875
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,282
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

876
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,035
-Shut up!
-No! Not this time.

877
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,498
I flew the giant peach
across the ocean.

878
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:51,293
I landed on top of the
tallest building in the world.

879
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,838
I made it! I'm not the one
who's nothing. You are!

880
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:59,092
And I'm never going back with you!
Not me, and not the peach.

881
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,762
How dare you speak to us this way?

882
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:16,318
James! Up here!

883
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,988
Hello! We're here!

884
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:23,033
-Hey, buddy!
-What are they?

885
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,954
-Young James.
-Hey, Jimmy!

886
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:31,166
-Bugs!
-Need a little help down there?

887
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,669
Giant bugs!

888
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:37,756
Hey, you old biddies!

889
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,008
-Help us!
-Here we are, dear.

890
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,177
Hello, James!

891
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,221
I told you they were real.

892
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:48,433
-Hello, old boy.
-Requesting clearance to land.

893
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,819
Miss Spider, throw me a string.

894
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,203
Okay. Pull them up.

895
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,163
Help!

896
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,668
Where are we going?

897
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,756
-Spin them around.
-You little...

898
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,636
Wrap them tightly!

899
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:35,063
Tighter! Tighter!

900
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,399
Well, I'll be a...

901
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,985
The kid was tellin' the truth.

902
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:45,866
Get those two creeps outta here!

903
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,921
Stop the presses!
I got a new front page!

904
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,089
"Big Bugs In The Big Apple."

905
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:05,052
In big, bold print, "A Little
Lindy Flies Giant Peach."

906
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,931
"Half-Pint Hero
And His Peach-Pit Pals."

907
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,561
Everyone, these are my friends,

908
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:16,730
the ones I've been telling you about.

909
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,941
-Mr Centipede.
-Hi.

910
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,068
-Old green Grasshopper.
-My pleasure.

911
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,237
-Earthworm. Mrs Ladybug.
-Charmed.

912
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:27,366
Miss Spider. And the Glowworm.

913
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,576
God bless the colonies.

914
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:34,790
-Could we eat some of your peach?
-It won't keep forever.

915
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,792
Go ahead.

916
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,679
Hey! What was your name?

917
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,306
It's James.

918
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,735
They ate that peach
all the way down to the pit

919
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:09,616
and set it up in Central Park
as a permanent home.

920
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,954
And James Henry Trotter,

921
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,624
who once was the saddest and
loneliest little boy you could find,

922
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:20,794
now had a loving new family,

923
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,463
and all the friends in the world.

924
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:26,174
James, dinner is ready.

925
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,635
All right. Nearly finished.

926
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,973
And then... And then the seagulls...

927
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,977
And since James' visitors
begged him again and again

928
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,355
to hear the story of his
adventure with the giant peach,

929
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,275
he wished for a way
to share it with everyone.

930
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:50,073
And that is exactly
what you have just seen.

931
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:08,967
Once upon a time
there was a vulture and a hog

932
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,971
Livin' in a house
up on a hill

933
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:17,350
Had this little boy who lived with them
They worked him like a dog

934
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:20,062
With any luck
they'd have him up there still

935
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:25,067
'Long came a magic man
with a magic bag

936
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:29,071
Full of nasty little
green things in a funky old rag

937
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:33,033
He said, Boy, you may not know it
but this here's salvation you see

938
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,869
Son, you're going down in history

939
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,084
Good news is blowin' in your window

940
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,463
Good news is knockin' on your door

941
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:50,300
Good news is comin' 'round the corner

942
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,096
Good news is rollin' 'round your floor

943
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:59,768
Where can all my troubles be

944
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,772
Must be good news chasin' me

945
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:07,192
Good enough to set everybody free

946
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:11,446
Good news, good news, good news

947
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,073
Good news

948
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:17,285
There were bugs in the garden
Didn't have a clue

949
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:21,248
But every day
their life was on the line

950
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:25,377
They wanted to get out of there
but they didn't know what to do

951
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,547
Their little brains
was workin' overtime

952
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:33,760
-Well
-That all changed one sunny day

953
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:37,347
That little boy dropped by to say

954
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,851
If we all work together
we'll make out okay

955
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:45,355
-We will
-Good news, good news, good news

956
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:49,484
So they rolled down the mountain
flew over the sea

957
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:53,155
Facin' death and danger on their way

958
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,282
But together they have made it

959
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,325
They're where they want to be

960
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,078
They love each other
more and more each day

961
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,832
They care about each other

962
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,168
Good news is sweepin'
'cross the country

963
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:10,088
Good news is spreadin' all around

964
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,217
Good news is hittin' in the city

965
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:18,388
Good news has sprung up in the town

966
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:23,810
The things that used to hurt before

967
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:27,772
They don't hurt 'em any more

968
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:31,151
'Cause they know there's
somethin' good in store
