1
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:24,024
Hey, Frank! Let's
wrap it up and go home.

2
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,359
What do you say?

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,444
Well, I got another
hour's work to do.

4
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,030
The kid's gonna stick with me,
and then I'll show him the ropes.

5
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,949
Okay. You lock up for
me before you go?

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,410
4th of July weekend, buddy boy.
Got to move.

7
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,578
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well, you have a nice 4th,

8
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,747
and I'll see you Sunday
at the barbecue.

9
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,500
You'd better believe it.
I'll be there with bells on.

10
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,670
Kid, I wanna tell you something,
and I mean this sincerely.

11
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:47,798
No matter what happens,
don't name it after me.

12
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,594
Take it easy, Frank.

13
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,638
That Burt's a joker.

14
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,557
OK, Freddy, follow me
and learn something.

15
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,225
Okay.

16
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,769
We got an order here from the St.
Louis University Medical School.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,939
They want two adult female
skeletons with perfect teeth.

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,734
That's a 2-AF-PT.

19
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,736
OK? So you come over
here to the "A" section.

20
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:10,904
- That's "A" for adult, see?
- Okay.

21
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,198
Then that's divided up
into two sections.

22
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,951
That's divided into the "M"
for male and the "F" for...

23
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,870
- Female.
- Good boy.

24
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,538
Now the "PT."

25
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,374
Suppose you think that's
"pretty tough", but no, that's...

26
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,210
- Perfect teeth.
- Very good.

27
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,005
Now you get some excelsior over
there and lay it in that crate.

28
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:31,134
Make a nice little beddy-bye
for this little lady.

29
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:33,136
Okay.

30
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,555
Good work. We want
her to be comfortable.

31
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,682
Now help me get her in.
Grab her legs.

32
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:40,225
Okay.

33
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,562
Now you get some of
that styrofoam popcorn,

34
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,898
spread it all around.

35
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,109
Don't be stingy.
Uncle Burt's paying for this.

36
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,029
More, Freddy, more.
OK, that's fine.

37
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,865
Now spread it around.
That's right.

38
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,534
- You're doing very nice work.
- Thanks.

39
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,578
You're gonna be fine in the
warehouse business.

40
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,371
Where do we get all
these skeletons from?

41
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,916
- Oh, they come from India.
- India?

42
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,835
International treaty.
All skeletons come from India.

43
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,253
No kidding. How come?

44
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:09,880
How the hell do I know "how come"?

45
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,799
The important question is,

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,134
where do they get all the
skeletons with perfect teeth?

47
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,136
I'm going to ask you a
serious question.

48
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,305
How many people you know die

49
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:21,767
with a beautiful, perfect set
of choppers in their puss, huh?

50
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,435
Nobody I can think of.

51
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:26,772
No. I think that there's a
skeleton farm over in India.

52
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,982
Jesus!

53
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,277
Come on, kid.
Follow your uncle here.

54
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,904
Here we go.

55
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,864
I don't have to tell
you what these are for.

56
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,283
Ba ba ba boom!

57
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,453
Here we've got the prosthetic
devices, all around here.

58
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:43,664
Look under there. Wheelchairs.

59
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:45,582
Right. These are great.

60
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,084
Here's something you
don't see very often.

61
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,128
You're a privileged person.

62
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:52,756
These are split dogs.
Yep, for veterinarian schools.

63
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,675
Oh, we get a lot of
orders for split dogs.

64
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:55,843
- That's really rad.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:58,887
Don't fool around, you're learning.

66
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:02,891
Over here, Freddy, is where
we keep the fresh cadavers.

67
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,810
We sell these to medical schools

68
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,397
and to the U.S. Army
for ballistic tests.

69
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,280
Well, say hello.

70
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,623
We usually got
more inventory than this,

71
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,544
but, ah, we're expecting
a shipment on Monday.

72
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:34,089
H-how many bodies are in here usually?

73
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,258
Well, you know, you don't
want to be overstocked.

74
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,177
Kind of like the restaurant business,

75
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:41,598
you don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

76
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,268
Tell you what I'll do, kid.

77
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,479
Teach you how to fill
out these shipping forms.

78
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,108
Look alive.

79
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,990
- We gonna party tonight or what?
- Yeah, we are gonna party.

80
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,450
Well, where?
Where we gonna party?

81
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,161
- I don't know. Somewhere.
- Hey, we could go to the park.

82
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,247
Oh, no, we can't. The cops will
shoot us if we go back to the park.

83
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,874
And I ain't in no mood to die tonight.

84
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,417
I like death.

85
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:12,252
I like death with sex.
How 'bout you, Casey?

86
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,546
- You like sex with death?
- Yeah, so fuck off and die.

87
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,131
So, when we gonna
party tonight, Tina?

88
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,257
Oh you guys,
that'd be really rad,

89
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,134
but I'm supposed to meet Freddy
when he gets off work.

90
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,844
Yeah, where you
supposed to meet him?

91
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,512
At this medical supply warehouse
where he's working.

92
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,848
Oh, no, he got a job?
What a dick.

93
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,558
Shit, why didn't you say so?

94
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,644
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

95
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,772
Freddy always knows where
there's a place to party.

96
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,990
Frank?

97
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,117
Yeah, kid?

98
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:47,454
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

99
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,997
Oh, kid,

100
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,375
I have seen weird things come,

101
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:54,169
and I have seen weird things go.

102
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,421
But the weirdest thing I ever saw

103
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,590
just had to cap it all.

104
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,260
Oh, yeah? What's that?

105
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:03,263
Let me ask you a question, kid.

106
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:09,059
Did you see that movie,
Night of the Living Dead?

107
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,019
Yeah, yeah, that's the
one where the corpses

108
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,312
start eating the people, right?

109
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,564
Sure. Wh-what about it?

110
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:18,151
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

111
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,696
Come on, you're shitting me, right?

112
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:23,241
I've never been more serious in my life.

113
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:25,659
That's not possible.

114
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,495
I mean, they showed
zombies taking over the world.

115
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:32,541
They changed it all around.
What really happened was

116
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:36,628
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh,
at the V.A. hospital,

117
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,797
there was a chemical spill

118
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:41,216
and all that stuff

119
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:44,052
kinda leaked down into the morgue

120
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,305
and it made all the dead bodies

121
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,473
kinda jump around as
though it was alive.

122
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,017
What chemical?

123
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,978
2-4-5-Trioxin,
it's called.

124
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,356
It was to kinda spray on
marijuana or something.

125
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,483
And the Darrow Chemical Company

126
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,652
was trying to develop it
for the Army.

127
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:04,239
And they told the guy who
made the movie

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,327
that if he told the true story,
they'd just sue his ass off.

129
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:11,663
So he changed all the
facts around.

130
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,999
So what really happened?

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,127
Well, they closed it all down, see,

132
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:20,839
and the Army shipped all
that contaminated dirt

133
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,925
and all those dead bodies out.

134
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,763
And they kept it a secret. Shh.

135
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:29,097
What...

136
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,683
So how come you know about it?

137
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,811
A typical Army fuck up.

138
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,566
The Transportation Department
got the orders crossed,

139
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,320
and they shipped those bodies here

140
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:46,282
instead of to the
Darrow Chemical Company.

141
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:52,914
Hello?

142
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,082
Oh, hi, honey.

143
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,125
Uh, no, I'll be home in
about an hour.

144
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,504
You keep the, uh,
pot roast hot, okay?

145
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,592
Yeah, sure, I love you,
too, honey. Yeah. Kiss, kiss.

146
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,599
Wanna see them?

147
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,312
- See them?
- The corpses.

148
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,440
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:23,444
- They're down in the basement.
- No.

150
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,822
- Come on.
- No way.

151
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,747
Hey, mind the third step.
It's a bitch.

152
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:37,833
You mean, they just brought
those bodies here and left them?

153
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,543
Well, you know the Army.

154
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,337
And they've been here
all this time?

155
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:44,382
14 years, as I recall.

156
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,301
No kidding?

157
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,055
There they are.

158
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,975
There's bodies in there?

159
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,579
Oh, shit. Look at that.

160
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,708
- You say that thing was alive?
- So they say.

161
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,299
Oh, God.

162
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:29,676
- Hey, these things don't leak, do they?
- Leak? Hell, no.

163
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,972
These things were made by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

164
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,726
Oh, fuck!

165
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,096
Hello, dear. How was your day?

166
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,598
The usual, crap.

167
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,350
Oh, I'm sorry.

168
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,726
What's for dinner?

169
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,853
Your favorite, lamb chops.

170
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,564
I had them for lunch.

171
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,712
Yes, it's me, checking in
from Station 3 at 1600--

172
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,048
uh, make that 1601 hours.

173
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,176
I'll be home all evening. Right.

174
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,943
It's nerve-racking to live around
that equipment all the time.

175
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:18,238
They have to be able to reach
me 24 hours a day, wherever I am.

176
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,322
You know that.

177
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,658
All that microwave
stuff affects my oven.

178
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:24,035
When we find them, you can
have the equipment taken out.

179
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,787
But when will you find them?

180
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,915
Christ, Ethel, I don't know!

181
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,210
Maybe we'll never find them.

182
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,007
Look, we've been
through all this before.

183
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,802
They could be anywhere.

184
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,976
Where the fuck we going, anyway?

185
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,478
- To party!
- To pick up Freddy.

186
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,188
Oh, yeah, what the fuck is
Freddy up to these days, anyway?

187
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,607
- He got himself a job.
- Oh, no shit? What job?

188
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,318
- He's a stockroom clerk.
- Yeah? That sounds like a shitty job.

189
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,028
Well, it isn't the President
of the United States,

190
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,864
but at least he makes
money to buy stuff.

191
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,782
Oh, yeah, maybe he'll
buy something from me?

192
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,909
He don't like your
kind of stuff, Suicide.

193
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,662
How come you guys only come 'round
when you need a ride someplace?

194
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,748
'Cause you one spooky
motherfucker, Suicide.

195
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,876
Oh, you think I'm spooky, huh?
What the fuck!

196
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,848
Man, what a hideous, ugly place.

197
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,268
- I like it. It's a statement.
- Come on, let's go get the prick.

198
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,395
- No.
- Why not?

199
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,231
- You might freak out his boss.
- Well, that's not nice.

200
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,067
Yeah, what does he think
we are, weird or something?

201
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,403
- What time does Freddy get off?
- 10:00.

202
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,238
I ain't sittin' here two
fuckin' hours.

203
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,157
We could always go drive around.

204
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,326
I don't got gas.
You wanna buy some gas, idiot?

205
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,702
I was kidding.

206
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,370
We could go fool around
in there for a while.

207
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,831
You mean that cemetery? Ahh.

208
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,625
Oh, let's do that.

209
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,562
What do you want to do, Scuz,
turn over gravestones?

210
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,773
No, I just want to look
around the graveyard.

211
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,608
I ain't never seen one before.

212
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,276
Ain't you never been to a funeral?

213
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,861
I never knew nobody that died.

214
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,780
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

215
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,949
- What's that?
- Road flares, asswipe.

216
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,618
- What do you want those?
- I just want to party.

217
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,538
What are the road flares for?

218
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,509
This place is a mess.

219
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,181
This looks like your pad, Scuz.

220
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,642
I heard that.

221
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,490
Frank?

222
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,801
Are you okay, kid?

223
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,929
I don't know. I don't--
I don't feel so good.

224
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,599
Christ, what a stink.

225
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,812
What the hell
happened to the body?

226
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,523
It must have melted
when it hit the air.

227
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,443
Close the goddamn thing.

228
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,123
Christ, I never smelled
anything like that before.

229
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,378
I think I'm gonna be sick.

230
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,317
Listen, I don't guess we'd
better tell Burt about this.

231
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,361
It makes us look stupid
or something.

232
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,321
I can still smell that stuff.

233
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,740
It must either be in my nose,
either that or it's all over everything.

234
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:34,243
Yeah, I'd better spray
some deodorant around here.

235
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,507
Oh.

236
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,802
What was that?

237
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,556
- Sounds like a dog.
- A dog?

238
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,558
Wait a second. Listen. Listen.

239
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,936
You hear that?

240
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,021
What the hell's going on here?

241
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,078
What's wrong with him?

242
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:21,958
Oh, shit!

243
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,585
What are we gonna do?

244
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,296
We're gonna kill it!

245
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,467
What are you doing? Stop!

246
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,265
Aah!

247
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,976
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

248
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,688
Are we fucked? What's happening?

249
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:46,607
It's the cadaver! The cadaver!

250
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,736
- What's it doing in there?
- I don't know. It sounds sore!

251
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,487
Well, what are we going to do?

252
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,656
- Lock it in.
- Yeah! Yeah!

253
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:54,867
Oh, Jesus!

254
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,995
Hurry! Jesus Christ!

255
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,622
We gotta think! We gotta think!

256
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,584
Come on, son, get in there!

257
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,753
Oh, Jesus Christ!

258
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,337
Are we going crazy?

259
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,048
No, it's that crap from the tanks.

260
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:12,842
The goddamn chemicals,
it's all over everything.

261
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,469
Stupid asshole!

262
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,345
Watch your tongue, boy,
if you like this job.

263
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,513
Like this job?

264
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,349
- Think! Think!
- We gotta call the cops.

265
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,851
No, you don't want to
call the cops.

266
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,644
You know what they'd do
to this company?

267
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,355
- Who cares about the company?
- Well, think of our reputation!

268
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,482
Fuck your reputation.

269
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:28,858
Think! Think!

270
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,027
What about the number
on the side of the tank?

271
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,613
The one that said to,
"Call in case of an emergency."

272
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,198
No, that's the Army.

273
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,076
You don't want the goddamn
Army around this place.

274
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:40,369
- Think!
- Well, what are we gonna do?

275
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,624
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna call the boss.

276
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,055
Burt? Frank.

277
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,556
We have a little problem.

278
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,312
Do you ever fantasize

279
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,731
about being killed?

280
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,525
Never.

281
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,276
Do you ever wonder

282
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,738
about all the different ways of dying,

283
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,990
you know, violently

284
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,617
and wonder, like,

285
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:23,287
what would be the most
horrible way to die?

286
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,957
I try not to think about
dying too much.

287
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,917
Mmm.

288
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,545
Well, for me

289
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,464
the worst way

290
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,717
would be for a bunch of old men

291
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,554
to get around me

292
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,472
and start biting

293
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,933
and eating me alive.

294
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,227
I see.

295
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,228
First,

296
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,773
they would tear off my clothes.

297
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,400
<i>Let's get some light over here.</i>

298
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,528
<i>Trash is taking off her clothes again.</i>

299
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,656
? In darkness you will find me ?

300
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,950
? I dance among the dead ?

301
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,869
? But very soon I'll need to hunt ?

302
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,912
? The scent of blood instead ?

303
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,039
? Tonight ?

304
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,502
? We'll make love 'till we die ?

305
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,047
? Tonight ?

306
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,591
? We'll make love 'til... ?

307
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,176
That's right. Throw it, baby.

308
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,636
Hey, are you high on anything?

309
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,847
? I know you think I'm nasty ?

310
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,891
? But I am no common girl ?

311
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,893
? I once slept with the devil ?

312
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,895
? It was really no big thrill ?

313
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,272
? Tonight ?

314
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,610
? We'll make love 'til we die ?

315
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:36,819
You did what?

316
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,196
You opened it? You stupid moron.

317
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,906
You idiot. What's the
matter with you, Frank?

318
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,866
Haven't I always told
you never to even

319
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,492
go near those goddamn tanks?

320
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,787
What are we gonna do, Burt?

321
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,914
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

322
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,749
I'm gonna be sued by the
Darrow Chemical Company,

323
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,542
I'm gonna be investigated
by the government.

324
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,836
I might become famous, Frank,
I might even lose my business.

325
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,755
I might even go to jail,
goddamn it.

326
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,299
That's what I'm gonna do.

327
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:06,265
On the other hand, we destroy
all this evidence around here

328
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,683
and we keep our mouths shut.

329
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,354
That's it! Let's do that, Burt!

330
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,857
Yeah, Frank, you're right.
That's what we got to do.

331
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,567
One question, Frank.

332
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:20,112
This guy screaming in here,
you're sure he's a dead cadaver?

333
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,615
Why don't you open
the door and find out?

334
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,992
I'm sorry, Frank.
I'll take your word for that.

335
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,996
If it is a reanimated body, we're
going-- we'll have to kill it.

336
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,958
How do you kill something
that's already dead?

337
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,710
Well, how do I know, Fred?
I don't know, let me think.

338
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,088
It's not a bad question, Burt.

339
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,382
In that movie, they destroyed
the brain to kill them.

340
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:42,010
- Is that what they did?
- The brain, right. Yeah.

341
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,638
What do doctors use
to crack skulls with?

342
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,307
- Surgical drills.
- Here, hold this, Frank.

343
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,976
Now listen to me,
both of you, very carefully.

344
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,560
Freddy, you're gonna
open that door.

345
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,438
Come here, you stand right
over here. Frank, right here.

346
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,399
When it comes out,
you brain it with that axe.

347
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,900
Oh, Jesus!

348
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,152
Well, how am I gonna
stop it from moaning?

349
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,821
What's the matter with you, Frank?

350
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,490
Fred, come here. Get down
there. Please, stand by the door.

351
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,284
It's gonna be all right, son.

352
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,536
I don't think I can do this, Burt.

353
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,663
Well, you damn well better.
You got us into this.

354
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,249
Oh, Jesus!

355
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,918
All right, Freddy. 22, right.

356
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,881
Oh!

357
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,759
Be brave, Frank, goddamn it!

358
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,053
4, left.

359
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,557
10, right.

360
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,652
Aah!

361
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,615
Get him off, Frank!

362
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,367
Aah!

363
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,173
Coming, Frank.

364
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,883
Hold it!

365
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,343
Aah!

366
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,930
Oh!

367
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,016
What the hell's going on, Burt?

368
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,060
The brain! The brain!

369
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,519
I hit the fucking brain!

370
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,482
Then do something else, for
goddamn-it-to-hell's sake.

371
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,901
Hold him down, Frank.

372
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,446
I can't stand this any longer.

373
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,990
- Oh, shit!
- Hold him down, now, hold him down,

374
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,535
What are you gonna do? Oh!

375
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,748
Be a man, Frank! Be a man!

376
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,709
I can't stand this, you son of a bitch.

377
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,878
Hurry up!

378
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,925
Oh, God!

379
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,109
- I'll get him!
- Get him!

380
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,653
- I got him.
- Get a rope!

381
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,196
Where the fuck's a rope?

382
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,031
I don't know.
Get one. Hold him down!

383
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,366
- Are you hanging on?
- Got him!

384
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,118
Hang on to the son of a bitch!

385
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,161
Christ, it ain't dying.

386
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,206
I thought you said if we
destroyed the brain, it'd die!

387
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,917
- It worked in the movie.
- Well, it ain't working now, Frank.

388
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,710
You mean the movie lied?

389
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,213
Oh, Jesus.

390
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,674
Ah!

391
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,052
How are we gonna kill it?

392
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,305
Maybe you can't kill it.
Maybe it won't die.

393
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,102
Then we just got to
destroy it completely

394
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,520
until there's nothing left.

395
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,021
Acid.

396
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,357
What kind of acid would
dissolve a body?

397
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,942
Sulfuric acid, maybe.

398
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:48,237
No, no, aqua regia,
that's stronger.

399
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:50,823
But what if it doesn't dissolve
everything, like the bones?

400
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:53,994
Shit!

401
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,247
What are we gonna do?

402
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,000
Burt?

403
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,918
Where are you going?

404
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,798
Sometimes Ernie Kaltenbrunner
works late on Friday nights.

405
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,675
Well, who's Ernie Kaltenbrunner?

406
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,511
He's the embalmer at the
mortuary across the street.

407
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,472
What the hell's
he gonna do for us?

408
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,224
His light's on. He's in.

409
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,395
Ernie's got a crematorium
across the street, Frank.

410
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,106
A crematorium, that's beautiful.

411
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,358
You think you can get
him to go along with it?

412
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,486
I don't know. I've known
Ernie about 25 years.

413
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,446
He might do it out of
friendship. I'm not sure.

414
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,740
Yeah, but what the hell
are you gonna tell him?

415
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,367
I mean, can you trust that bastard?

416
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:38,329
I don't think we have a choice, Frank.

417
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,082
How we--how we gonna get
this thing over there?

418
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,715
Give me the bone saw.

419
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,555
Why don't you put your
clothes on? The show's over.

420
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,476
What's the matter?
does it make you nervous?

421
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,145
I'm hot.

422
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,231
Yeah. You are hot.

423
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,691
Scram, wimp.

424
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,282
Nobody understands me,
you know that?

425
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,452
I fuckin' bust my ass for
you guys, and what do I get?

426
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,621
"You're spooky."

427
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,915
Fuck you, man. Fuck you all.

428
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,501
I like it spooky.

429
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,419
I mean, I got somethin'
to say, you know?

430
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,255
What do you think this is all about?

431
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,215
You think this is a fuckin' costume?

432
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,925
This is a way of life!

433
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,511
Oh, yes.

434
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,597
Hey, what's wrong with you, man?

435
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,309
Show some fucking respect
for the dead, will ya?

436
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,523
- Hey, is that Freddy?
- Where?

437
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,275
Over there,
going in the building.

438
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:51,444
Nope. That is not Freddy.

439
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,737
How would you know?

440
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,491
Because. Why would Freddy
be going into a mortuary?

441
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,659
Damn!

442
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,170
What do you say, Ernie?

443
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,302
Hey, Ernie.

444
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,303
Whoa!

445
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,473
- Take it easy.
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.

446
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,351
Fast on the draw.

447
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:05,769
Whew.

448
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,937
You are working late tonight.

449
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,232
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Pretty much. Kind of...

450
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,027
What time is it?
You want a cup of coffee?

451
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,862
Uh, no. No, thank you. I'm all right.

452
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,448
I do, and I need it.

453
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,537
What, uh, what are-- what
are you doing there, Ernie?

454
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,706
Breaking out the rigor mortis.

455
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,792
Oh, yeah?

456
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,378
Come here.

457
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,046
- Huh?
- Come on.

458
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:37,091
You see, rigor mortis
starts in the brain.

459
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,677
And it spreads down
to the internal organs,

460
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,096
and it finally settles in the muscles.

461
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,933
It, uh,

462
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:48,686
loosens up after a while,
but, uh, you can, uh,

463
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:52,898
you can break it out
manually, as they say

464
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,859
by flexing the muscles. See that?

465
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,902
Yeah.

466
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,071
You'll not find that
in a book, my friend.

467
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:03,033
The embalming business is basically
passed on by word of mouth.

468
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,579
I'll tell you, that's fascinating,
Ernie, that's really something.

469
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,044
Well, he's dead now.
And I am bushed.

470
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,967
Hey, uh, buddy boy. Uh,

471
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,887
how long we been friends,
Ernie? About how long? About...

472
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,599
- 25 years, give or take.
- Yeah.

473
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,437
Uh, if I ask you a favor,
could you keep it quiet?

474
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,272
Sure. What is it?

475
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,232
Well, I'm gonna need
some help, Ernie,

476
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,901
in a pretty big way, really.

477
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,320
You can depend on me.
Why? What's wrong?

478
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:44,616
Uh, I got a couple of my men out
here, y-you mind if I let them in?

479
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,785
B-Burt, that's illegal.

480
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,996
You can bring it on in now, please.

481
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,500
Fred, you can put it right
over here. Right here.

482
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,005
What is that?

483
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,967
Right there, please.

484
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,094
- Here?
- Yeah.

485
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,313
I got to...

486
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,023
Yeah.

487
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,903
What the hell is in those bags?

488
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,572
- Rabid weasels.
- What?

489
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,866
What the hell are you
doing with rabid weasels?

490
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,577
I was trying to explain it to
you. They came as a shipment.

491
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,537
'Course, they weren't
supposed to be rabid,

492
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,498
you know, but you know
how these things happen.

493
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,082
No, I don't. How do they happen?

494
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,959
Watch out! Watch out,
Ernie. Don't get bit.

495
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,085
Yeah.

496
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,338
Anyway, we got them,
and we need your help.

497
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,672
How?

498
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,633
We got to get rid of these things.

499
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,177
Well, why don't you
call an animal shelter?

500
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,095
Well, word'd get out,
hurt my business.

501
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,097
You know, that's a
bad scene, rabies.

502
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,516
I don't think so.

503
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:53,435
I mean, so what?
You don't run a pet store.

504
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,521
So, some lab animals got rabies.

505
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:58,358
Come on, guys,
take them to the pound.

506
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,193
Well, I just can't do that.

507
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,112
You got to--you got to
take my word for it.

508
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,824
What the hell do you
want me to do?

509
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,743
- You have a crematorium, right?
- You wanna burn them?

510
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,620
Yeah, that's what I
had in mind, actually.

511
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,205
That's cruel.

512
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,748
I can't think of anything else to do.

513
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:18,252
Y-y-you just can't
burn animals alive.

514
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,045
It's just too hideous.

515
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,839
At least let me kill them first.

516
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,425
Take 'em out in the parking lot,
and put 'em out of their misery.

517
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,137
I don't think that'd work, Ernie.

518
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,766
I don't?I don't u-understand
what's going on. W-why not?

519
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,566
Can you swear to keep a secret, Ernie?

520
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,568
At this point, I don't know.

521
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,152
No, no, y-you got to swear.

522
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,321
You got to, or I
just-- I can't tell you.

523
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,283
All right, I swear.

524
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,660
Good.

525
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,083
It's not weasels in the bags.

526
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,879
No. No kidding. Look here.

527
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,014
Oh!

528
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,808
Get it off!

529
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,061
Get it off! Get it off!

530
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,062
Frank!

531
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,487
I'm sorry, Ernie.

532
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,866
No, it's all right.

533
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,832
Ernie, we got a...

534
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,627
We got a long story to tell you.

535
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,795
Oh, great. Some party.

536
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,256
What happened to Trash and Suicide?

537
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:48,551
Probably getting it on somewhere.

538
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,846
Don't even think it, Chuck.

539
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,641
Oh, God, when's 10:00
gonna come?

540
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,561
Hey, if you wanna split,
we could both go somewhere.

541
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:04,107
You'd really like to do
it with me, wouldn't you?

542
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,402
Hey, I mean, a girl like
you and a guy like me.

543
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,112
Go choke a chicken.

544
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,282
Oh, come on, Casey.
I was only kidding.

545
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,493
Oh, great, here's your
friend and mine.

546
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,454
Hey, fuck you, ball buster.

547
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,084
Hey, my watch stopped.
What time is it?

548
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,882
Going on 10:00.

549
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:31,051
Oh, fudge. I'd better
get over and find Freddy.

550
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:33,136
He's gonna be getting
off any time now.

551
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,680
OK. Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

552
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,766
- Don't go anywhere, okay?
- All right.

553
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:40,037
Come on, Freddy, where are you?

554
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,413
Frankly, Burt,

555
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:44,207
I think you acted precipitously
in cutting up the corpse.

556
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:47,002
Well, you may be right,
I don't know, but I did it.

557
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,213
So what--what are we
gonna do about it, Ernie?

558
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:54,385
If I let you use the crematorium,
what's in it for me?

559
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,097
What do you want?

560
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:01,600
Well, uh,

561
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:04,311
the way I see it,
this is a pretty big favor.

562
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,480
Well, Ernie, you got it!
Whatever it is you want,

563
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,775
so help me, I'll--
I'll do it. I promise.

564
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,030
I'm sorry about that.

565
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,847
All right. Let's take
care of your problem.

566
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,148
Yes siree,

567
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,983
you're gonna owe me a big one.

568
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,820
Now buddy-boy, you go get rid of
everything for me. Nothing left.

569
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,031
- Is that right?
- Everything'll go.

570
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,328
What about the bones?

571
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,622
Bones are no problem.

572
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,458
The hardest thing to burn
is the heart.

573
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,960
The heart? Why?

574
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,087
'Cause it's just one big,
tough muscle.

575
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,631
Yeah, but Ernie, I
mean, come on. We don't--

576
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,466
We don't want the heart
sticking around.

577
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:18,385
Then I'll turn it up
hotter for the heart.

578
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,428
And what about the split dogs?
They got to go, too.

579
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,515
The split dogs will go, too.

580
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,813
Come on, just give me a hand.
It's your mess.

581
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:34,110
Oh.

582
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,404
Some big favor.

583
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:40,115
I can operate that goddamn thing.

584
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,367
You're absolutely certain

585
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,495
that this will get rid of
everything and do the trick?

586
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:48,665
- I mean, nothing left?
- Nothing but a little pile of ashes.

587
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,500
We don't even want the ashes, Ernie.

588
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:54,463
Well, then I'll turn it up higher,
and we'll burn up the ashes, too.

589
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,135
Dust to dust.

590
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:59,110
- Oh, my radio.
- Come on, you guys.

591
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,947
Let's get back to the car.
Damn it.

592
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:03,157
Come on.

593
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:19,757
Freddy?

594
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,342
Anybody?

595
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,803
Get the fuckin' top! Fuck.

596
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,931
Get the fuckin' top, man!

597
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:30,643
Come on!

598
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,646
Close the motherfuckin' windows.

599
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:37,066
I don't have any windows.
I busted them.

600
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,403
- Hey, my skin burns.
- Me, too. Damn it.

601
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,613
It's that rain,
it's like acid rain.

602
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:45,156
Start the car!

603
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,826
It's all over me. A towel,
somebody give me a towel.

604
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:50,912
- We ain't got no towel!
- Well, then give me something.

605
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,872
- Give me that.
- No!

606
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,457
Give me something!

607
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,834
Come on, start!

608
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,795
- Suicide, get the car going.
- I'm trying.

609
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:02,133
Oh, crap, I wonder what's
in that rain.

610
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,480
Look at it.

611
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:19,233
It's coming down like,
einen getrunken soldat.

612
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:50,722
- Is the heart gone, Ernie?
- It's all burned up.

613
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:53,224
- Are you sure?
- Right up the chimney.

614
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,102
Goddamn, that's all we need.
We're home free, Frank.

615
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,646
We got it made. You just
saved our ass, buddy boy,

616
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,900
and I owe you one. Goddamn!

617
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,485
Yes, you do.

618
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,695
Alright, let's get back to that
warehouse, clean up the mess,

619
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:07,072
and get the hell out of there.

620
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,490
What do you say, Frank?

621
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,325
Okay, just--just give
me a second to rest,

622
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:12,202
catch my breath.
Then we'll do it, okay?

623
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,955
Frank, I don't know about
you, but I'm really sick.

624
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,791
Why? What's wrong, Fred?

625
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,667
I feel like hell is what's wrong.

626
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,296
- I'm really sick.
- I'm sick, too, Burt.

627
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,923
Sick, like how?

628
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:27,259
I feel like my head's
going to bust wide open.

629
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:30,345
And I want to puke.

630
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:32,013
And I'm weak, too.

631
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:33,890
Me, too. I got the chills.

632
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:35,266
It's that stuff, Burt.

633
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,893
It's that goddamn stuff we breathed.

634
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:39,020
What stuff? What are
you talking about, Frank?

635
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:42,399
When that canister cracked,
this gas squirted out.

636
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,651
It hit us right in the face.

637
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,153
We breathed it.

638
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:49,406
It knocked us out.

639
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,408
We were out cold,
unconscious for a while.

640
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:53,201
Oh, Christ! Ernie.

641
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:55,537
Shouldn't we get to a doctor
or-- or something like that?

642
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,122
Yeah, Burt, I need a doctor.

643
00:40:57,123 --> 00:40:58,206
Man, I'm getting the car

644
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,291
and taking these guys to the
emergency ward right now.

645
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,918
Let's go, Frank.
You're gonna be alright.

646
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,503
We're gonna get you there.

647
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,130
Hey, Frank!

648
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,048
Frank!

649
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,304
Come here, Ernie.

650
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,642
What's the matter? Talk to me.
Get him out of the rain.

651
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:22,730
I gotta?I gotta call my wife.
I gotta go to the hospital!

652
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:26,025
You can't run around in
this storm. You're too sick.

653
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,153
Burt.

654
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,281
Take it easy. Take it easy.

655
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:32,574
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

656
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,660
Paramedics. Paramedics.

657
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,331
It's all right.
How do you feel now?

658
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:46,754
Hello. Yes.

659
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:50,091
Uh, can we get some paramedics
over here right away?

660
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:53,303
That's the Resurrection Funeral Home

661
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:56,765
at 21702 East Central.

662
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:01,479
Uh, well, tell them to come around
the back, to the embalming room.

663
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,648
Uh, no, no, um...

664
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:09,903
Poison. We have two men
poisoned here.

665
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:12,114
Uh, well, no, we--we don't
know what kind of poison.

666
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:15,241
Right.

667
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:17,203
Thank you very much. Bye.

668
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:21,247
Burt, they're on their way.

669
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,293
This car ain't going nowhere.

670
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:26,420
- Damn it.
- Shh-shh!

671
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,547
Do you hear something?

672
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,341
Hear what?

673
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,301
Something.

674
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,455
No, I don't hear nothing.

675
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:03,915
This roof's leaking.

676
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,084
- There's a rip, damn it.
- Shit.

677
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:07,669
Oh, don't do that!

678
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,087
- Shit!
- I'm sorry.

679
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:10,922
Shit, Scuz!

680
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,341
Hello, there?

681
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:14,260
Freddy?

682
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,474
Anybody?

683
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:38,158
Freddy? Are you here?

684
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:58,804
Anybody here?

685
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,414
Who's there?

686
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,835
Brains!

687
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,839
Brains!

688
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:38,760
Hey, I got to get out of here.

689
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,470
Let's go to where
Tina and Freddy are.

690
00:44:40,471 --> 00:44:42,264
- Damn right.
- Fuckin' A.

691
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,104
Live brain.

692
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:14,129
Come on, quick!

693
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,445
God, my skin's really burning.

694
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:49,872
Hey, Tina!

695
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,542
Yes! Oh, God! Help me!

696
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:54,544
- That's Tina.
- What's she yelling about?

697
00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:56,296
- What's that sound?
- Through that door!

698
00:45:58,215 --> 00:46:00,217
Watch the fuckin' step!

699
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:02,261
Help me!

700
00:46:02,636 --> 00:46:04,178
What the fuck?

701
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:10,936
Brains!

702
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,452
More brains.

703
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,042
Where the fuck you going?

704
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:37,962
Help me bar the door!
Stupid fuckers!

705
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:55,981
It's them.

706
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,235
Who took the poison?

707
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,488
Right over there.

708
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,662
Stick your tongue out for me.

709
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:20,546
What did you guys take?

710
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:23,341
It was some kind of industrial chemical,

711
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:25,093
I think, something in a tank.

712
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:27,720
What tank? Where?

713
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:29,639
Well, we--we're
not sure, really.

714
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,098
Well, can you find out?

715
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,100
I mean, your friends'
lives may depend on it.

716
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,561
Yeah, well, I got to
make some phone calls,

717
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:38,064
but I?I can't do that
before morning. I'm sorry.

718
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:40,150
Let's take some vital signs.

719
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,368
- Can I borrow your stethoscope?
- What's the matter?

720
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:51,953
I can't hear anything
through mine.

721
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,246
Well, are you sure
it's the equipment?

722
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:54,747
What do you mean?

723
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:57,416
Well, I'm not getting
anything on this, either.

724
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:59,126
What do you mean? What's wrong?

725
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:00,962
What's wrong?

726
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:03,590
It's all right. We just need
to double check a couple things.

727
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:15,978
- No blood pressure.
- No pulse.

728
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,146
Well, what do you mean,
"No blood pressure, no pulse"?

729
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,815
Shh. Take it easy. Take it easy.

730
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,449
- What do you have?
- 70.

731
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,118
- 70 what?
- 70 degrees.

732
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:34,830
- Well, what's that?
- Room temperature.

733
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,417
Come over here for a second.
I want to talk to you.

734
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,091
What are you guys saying?

735
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:48,385
What are you guys saying?

736
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,721
What was that thing down there?

737
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:54,223
- What the fuck are we gonna do?
- Hey, Suicide's down there.

738
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,851
No way man, he's gone.
That thing ate his head.

739
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,103
Jesus!

740
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,230
I don't hear anything
down there, do you?

741
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:02,690
Oh, we got to call somebody.

742
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:04,817
- Who?
- The cops.

743
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:07,695
I don't wanna call no cop.
The cops are just gonna kick our ass.

744
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:09,655
Just let's get out of here, okay?

745
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,616
No! We gotta call somebody.

746
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:13,868
Wait a minute, where's Freddy?

747
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:15,954
He was gone, he wasn't here
when I showed up.

748
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:42,104
Holy shit. We're gonna have
to swim to get over there.

749
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,025
What the fuck was that?

750
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:48,153
Look! There!

751
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,371
? Do you wanna party ?

752
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,582
? It's partytime ?

753
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:04,878
? We gotta party ?

754
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,256
? It's partytime ?

755
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:12,344
? Do you wanna party ?

756
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:16,806
? It's partytime ?

757
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:22,229
Hey, wait up, you guys!
Wait, I got no shoes!

758
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,484
? It's partytime ?

759
00:50:28,986 --> 00:50:31,487
? It's partytime ?

760
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:34,908
No! No!

761
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:41,580
You have no pulse, your blood
pressure's zero over zero,

762
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,124
you have no pupillary response,

763
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,210
no reflexes, your
temperature is 70 degrees.

764
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:49,213
W-what does that mean?

765
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:52,758
It's a puzzle, because technically,
you're not alive.

766
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:55,636
Except you're conscious, so
we don't know what it means.

767
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:58,305
- Are you saying we're dead?
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

768
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:01,475
Obviously, I didn't mean
you were really dead.

769
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,811
Dead people don't move
around and talk.

770
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:07,023
- What's the hell's that?
- Front door.

771
00:51:07,024 --> 00:51:09,650
- What the fuck are they doing?
- I'll find out.

772
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:11,610
Listen we're gonna go
get a couple of stretchers.

773
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:13,612
Just hang in there.
W-we won't be a second.

774
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,157
Open the door.

775
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:17,450
Open the door, please.

776
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:18,451
Help!

777
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:20,120
Hey! Open the door!

778
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:22,747
Open the door!

779
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,375
Hurry up!

780
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,169
Freeze, or you're dead!

781
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,545
Don't shoot, man!

782
00:51:29,546 --> 00:51:31,797
Are you crazy? Are you on PCP?

783
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,924
None of us are on any
drugs, man. Just let us in!

784
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,052
All right, come in, come in.
But no funny moves.

785
00:51:36,053 --> 00:51:37,386
Shit, no.

786
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:39,138
You gotta lock all your
doors and your windows,

787
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:40,598
and call the cops!
They're out there!

788
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,433
- What? Who's out there?
- Don't you hear that?

789
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:45,019
- What?
- Shut up and listen, man!

790
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:48,647
What is it?

791
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:51,358
- It's dead people screaming.
- What dead people?

792
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,860
They came from out of the ground.

793
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:53,903
And they're after us.

794
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:55,654
Out of the ground?

795
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:58,365
Our friends took off the other way.
And they're out there now!

796
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:03,955
Brains!

797
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:07,000
Brains!

798
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:09,586
Brains!

799
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,047
Brains!

800
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:17,176
- Trash? Where's Trash?
- Didn't she go with them?

801
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:19,096
I thought she was with us.

802
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:23,433
- Hey, do you hear that?
- Hear what?

803
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:27,813
Christ, Jesus.

804
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,980
What is that?

805
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,900
It sounds like people screaming.

806
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:35,445
You get the stretchers,
I'll get on the radio and phone this in.

807
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:57,342
Jerry?

808
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:06,767
Brain!

809
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,937
Brain! Brain!

810
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,148
What? What kind of a problem?

811
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:13,732
Take a look at it.

812
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,860
Why, what the hell's
going on out here?

813
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:17,695
That graveyard out
there's full of people

814
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:19,071
coming out of the ground.

815
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:20,531
Whaddya mean "out of the ground"?

816
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:22,158
Yes, out of the ground.

817
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:24,451
They're horrible, they scream,
you've got to do something.

818
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:25,452
Scream--?

819
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:26,954
Yes, mister, they're out there.

820
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:28,956
And there's one of them
in that warehouse.

821
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:31,333
- Which-- which warehouse?
- The medical supply house.

822
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,377
Oh, shit! Shit!

823
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:34,712
- And they're--
- Goddamn!

824
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,339
I-I-I think things are
getting out of hand.

825
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,092
Mister, there's 100 of
those things out there.

826
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,385
100?

827
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:43,012
The cops. We got to call the cops.

828
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:45,347
Yeah. No shit.

829
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:48,601
Phone. Where the fuck is the phone?

830
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,395
There! There's an office!

831
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,861
Hello, operator, give me the police.
This is an emergency.

832
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,204
Grab the hammer and nails! Casey!

833
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:11,081
Quiet! Let's just get the
hell out of here, Ernie.

834
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:13,125
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

835
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:14,752
Get your keys.
Let's get out of here.

836
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:16,337
My clutch is shot.

837
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:18,215
We'll use the paramedic ambulance.

838
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,382
Freddy! Oh!

839
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:21,926
- Ernie?
- Yeah?

840
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:23,510
Where are the paramedics?

841
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,387
I'll get them.
Get my own car started.

842
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:27,849
Oh, my god, Freddy!
What did they do to you?

843
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,310
- Oh, God!
- What was that shooting?

844
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:15,271
- Oh, God!
- What? What, Ernie?

845
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:16,231
God!

846
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:20,109
- Oh, God!
- What the hell?

847
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,528
It...

848
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,113
It!

849
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,198
"It"? It what? What is "it"?

850
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,742
They're all over the cars.

851
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:32,288
It's horrible.
They're out there. They're...

852
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:36,542
Paramedics are dead. And we--we
can't take the cars. We-- I? Burt,

853
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:39,628
we've gotta--we've
gotta call the police.

854
00:55:39,629 --> 00:55:41,588
Set him down. Set him down.

855
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,049
Set him down. Easy.

856
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:46,845
It's not--not--not
it's not working.

857
00:55:47,304 --> 00:55:48,513
Come on.

858
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:08,657
- What's the matter?
- Dead.

859
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:12,078
Brains! Brains!

860
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:22,172
Help me.

861
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:31,765
You got some hammer and nails?

862
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:37,978
? Ooh, baby, your ?
? asphalt eater hung ten ?

863
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:41,440
? The hoedads and gremmies ?
? say you reached top end ?

864
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:45,235
? So do the dead, through the lights ?

865
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:48,781
? The surfin' dead, ooh, make it tight ?

866
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:52,576
? The livin' dead, now, ?
? baby, lose their heads ?

867
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:54,495
Where else can they get in here?

868
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:56,538
The windows in the chapel.

869
00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:00,293
? You're a high-rev hauler ?
? with all four on the floor ?

870
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:04,088
Is there anything to bar
these windows with?

871
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:06,758
I don't think we have to.
I put boards outside the glass.

872
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:11,720
? Come on, the livin' dead, ?
? ooh, you're in the soup ?

873
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:13,931
? The livin' dead, now, baby ?

874
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:16,935
? Like I said, now, baby, do the dead ?

875
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,563
? Now, do it ?

876
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,610
Rescue 7, Rescue 7,
come in. This is dispatch. Over.

877
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:32,200
Rescue 7, come in. This is dispatch.
Do you copy? Over.

878
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:35,661
Come in, dispatch.

879
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:37,037
Send

880
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,414
more

881
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:39,707
paramedics.

882
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,641
How many fuckin' windows
you got in this place?

883
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:59,310
No more windows.

884
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:02,146
The embalming room has steel shutters.

885
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:05,525
Well, let's get the hell back to
the embalming room then. Come on.

886
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:12,197
Man, my arms are dead.

887
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:14,158
Put that goddamn
thing down, Ernie,

888
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,076
before you hurt
somebody with it.

889
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,704
- How they doing?
- Buddy, are you all right?

890
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:21,206
- It hurts.
- What did you do to Freddy?

891
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,792
What's wrong with him?
And this man?

892
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:26,253
I think it's time you tell
us what the fuck's going on.

893
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:27,880
I don't have to tell you anything,
dick brain.

894
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:29,506
We think you should.

895
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,050
Tell them, goddamn it!

896
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,887
Tell us!

897
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:36,598
There was a chemical.

898
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:40,309
It was some chemical
that soaked into the soil

899
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,936
of the graveyard and made
the corpses come back to life.

900
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:44,354
Yeah? What fucking chemical?

901
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,982
I don't know what chemical, goddamn it!

902
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:49,776
It was ordered by the military,
I think. I think it was.

903
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,571
Would you tell me me how the fuck
did it get all over the graveyard?

904
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,990
I don't know. I just...

905
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:56,450
All I know is that
it was stored

906
00:58:56,451 --> 00:58:58,410
over at the medical
supply warehouse

907
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,496
where you were,
and these two geniuses

908
00:59:00,497 --> 00:59:02,456
managed to open the
goddamn container

909
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:05,542
and let the son of a
bitch out. Let 'em out!

910
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,211
Is that why Freddy's sick?

911
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:09,379
I breathed it, Tina.

912
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,382
So did--so did
Frank there.

913
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:15,511
What did it do to you, Freddy?

914
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:17,971
I'm freezing.

915
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,890
My muscles are stiffening up.

916
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:22,059
Stiffening up?

917
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,061
Stiffening up how, Freddy?

918
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:26,855
First, I got a really fucked headache.

919
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:31,151
Then--then my--my stomach
started cramping--cramping up.

920
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:33,488
Now my arms and legs are cramping.

921
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:36,698
Let's take a look. Let's take a look.

922
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:39,660
Oh, God!

923
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,872
Let's get his shirt up, huh?

924
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,374
What are you doing, Ernie?

925
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,417
Oh, God.

926
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,254
Uh, the bruises where he's lying down,

927
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:51,922
uh,

928
00:59:51,923 --> 00:59:54,091
that's blood pooling up.

929
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:58,263
Easy. Easy. Easy!

930
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,140
Okay.

931
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:07,437
You know, it looks like

932
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,439
rigor mortis is setting in.

933
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,694
Rigor mortis? What do
you mean, rigor mortis?

934
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,780
Hey, God, you're dead.

935
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:19,741
You're dead, and you're gonna turn
into one of those things out there!

936
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:20,742
No!

937
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:21,703
- No!
- No!

938
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:25,498
- Let him go!
- Son of a bitch!

939
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,625
Shut--
Just shush!

940
01:00:30,128 --> 01:00:31,671
Do you hear that?

941
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:37,092
What is that?

942
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:38,803
It's another paramedic ambulance.

943
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,690
Watch out! Watch out!

944
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,400
Hey! Don't go over there!

945
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:56,029
Brains!

946
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,115
God damn!

947
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:02,326
Fuck. They're gonna kill
everybody that comes here.

948
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:25,683
Watch out, I'm going to
put the board back up.

949
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:30,938
It's got me!

950
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:49,874
Get this thing out of here!

951
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:53,461
Pull her off! Pull her off!

952
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:57,423
Christ.

953
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:01,093
Damn, he's dead. Shit. Shit.

954
01:02:01,094 --> 01:02:02,844
What do we do with this thing?

955
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:04,137
What do we do with this?

956
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,681
Just--just wait
there a second.

957
01:02:05,682 --> 01:02:07,099
Let's get out of here.

958
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,850
Where the fuck is he going?

959
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,353
Ernie, what are you doing?

960
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:12,855
Hey!

961
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,566
Let me take it! Let me take it!

962
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,068
You can let go of it now.

963
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:19,487
Are you crazy?

964
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:23,573
Look at it. She looks better now.

965
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:25,534
Better.

966
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:28,245
We got to get out of here, Ernie.

967
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:31,081
Ernie, we got to get
the fuck out of here.

968
01:02:31,082 --> 01:02:32,874
Leave it.

969
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,878
What are you doing?
Goddamn it, Ernie!

970
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,673
I don't understand
what you want with it, Ernie.

971
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:42,300
- What are we doing with it?
- I want to examine it.

972
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,885
You make sure it's tied right.

973
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:45,387
It's being tied right.

974
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:47,431
I mean, it's not
gonna get loose, right?

975
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:49,516
No, it's not gonna get loose.

976
01:02:49,517 --> 01:02:51,894
They're no stronger than humans.

977
01:02:58,067 --> 01:02:59,860
Don't be afraid.

978
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,987
I'll bust it in the damn head.

979
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:03,865
Now, you sure that
thing's tied good?

980
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:08,619
- You can hear me?
- Yes.

981
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,207
Why do you eat people?

982
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,627
Not people, brains.

983
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,296
Brains only?

984
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:20,840
Yes.

985
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:22,841
Why?

986
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,927
The pain.

987
01:03:25,887 --> 01:03:27,387
What about the pain?

988
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:30,641
The pain of being dead.

989
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:37,565
It hurts to be dead.

990
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:43,154
I can feel myself rot.

991
01:03:44,906 --> 01:03:46,616
Eating brains

992
01:03:47,617 --> 01:03:50,327
how does that make you feel?

993
01:03:50,328 --> 01:03:54,665
It makes the pain go away.

994
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:03,089
Hey, look, man, fuck this.

995
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,051
I got to talk to you. Now.

996
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:09,931
Come on, I got to talk.
We got to talk.

997
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:14,267
No, let's talk out in the hall.

998
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:23,360
Look, how can we kill those things?

999
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:24,945
You don't.

1000
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:26,738
What the fuck
do you mean, "you don't"?

1001
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:29,115
You can't kill those mothers,
they're already dead.

1002
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,827
You've gotta understand they're not living
creatures, they're animated.

1003
01:04:31,828 --> 01:04:35,163
You can chop them up into pieces,
the pieces will still come after you.

1004
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:36,873
All you can do is
just burn them.

1005
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:38,583
You got to totally reduce
them to ashes,

1006
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,627
so there's nothing
left to come after you.

1007
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:42,838
How you gonna burn
all those things?

1008
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,965
Man, there's 100 of those fuckers.

1009
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:47,301
Yeah, that is the question.

1010
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,353
? Tonight ?

1011
01:04:58,354 --> 01:05:02,608
? We'll make love till we die ?

1012
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:07,989
? Tonight ?

1013
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:49,446
We have a 10-32 from EMS.

1014
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,406
Two, repeat, two paramedic vehicles

1015
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,283
missing in the East Piedmont district.

1016
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:55,201
Request a 10-51, code 3.

1017
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:57,162
Available units near the 20,000 block

1018
01:05:57,163 --> 01:05:59,289
of East Central, please respond, over.

1019
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,250
Do you think they'll rescue us?

1020
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:05,795
They better, man.
That's all I got to say.

1021
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:10,926
Oh, God, please.

1022
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:13,261
But do you think they will?

1023
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:22,813
Chuck?

1024
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:26,025
I never did like you.

1025
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:30,571
Oh, my God, hold me tight.

1026
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:33,531
Look, I think it'd be a lot wiser

1027
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:35,241
if we, say, contained Frank and Freddy.

1028
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:36,368
You know what I'm saying?

1029
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:38,161
No, what do you mean, "contained"?

1030
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:40,330
What I mean is lock them in a
room, so if they started

1031
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:42,123
acting funny,
they wouldn't hurt anybody.

1032
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:43,708
They don't want to hurt anybody.

1033
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:46,127
You bastard! Why don't
you lock yourselves up?

1034
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:49,297
Look, lady, we're not proposing doing
anything to them, for Christ's sake.

1035
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,383
We just want to lock them in
another room so we can figure out

1036
01:06:51,384 --> 01:06:53,176
how to get the hell out of here.
Alright?

1037
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,553
Tina, that really is a good idea.

1038
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:57,097
Where can we put them, Ernie?

1039
01:06:57,098 --> 01:06:59,432
Uh, yeah, well, uh, the chapel.

1040
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,185
All right, help me with Frank, please.

1041
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,105
- Lift his feet.
- Come on.

1042
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,705
On the rug.

1043
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:25,376
Lay them on the carpet, gently.

1044
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:27,877
Easy.

1045
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:31,297
Easy, Frank. It's all right.
Can you hear me, Frank?

1046
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:33,550
Oh, boy, he's gone.

1047
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:38,179
Oh, Freddy.

1048
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,348
Look, let's just leave
them and get out.

1049
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:42,308
I'm not leaving Freddy.

1050
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,061
We got to lock the door,
you know that?

1051
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:46,564
I'm staying.

1052
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:50,567
Okay. Come on.

1053
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:51,819
Come on, Ernie.

1054
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,706
Dispatch, dispatch. This is bravo 751.

1055
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:06,458
We're at the mortuary.

1056
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:08,543
We see two, that is two,

1057
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:11,588
paramedic vehicles parked
in the rear parking lot.

1058
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:14,090
The doors on one
vehicle are hanging open.

1059
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:16,343
Stand by while we investigate.
Over.

1060
01:08:40,785 --> 01:08:42,536
I got a man down.

1061
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:48,542
Ah, Jesus!

1062
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:53,838
Hold it right there!

1063
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,008
Freeze or I'll blow
your fucking brains out!

1064
01:09:00,638 --> 01:09:02,972
This place...

1065
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:06,769
Everybody that comes in
gets swallowed up.

1066
01:09:07,937 --> 01:09:10,230
Send more cops.

1067
01:09:10,231 --> 01:09:12,398
Well, what are we gonna do?
Stand here, beating our meat till

1068
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,400
the corpses bust in this damn place?

1069
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:16,528
There ain't no way to stop those things.
We gotta get the fuck out.

1070
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:17,695
We got to get to the cars.

1071
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:19,155
There's corpses all over the cars.

1072
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:21,991
- I know that.
- What are you proposing?

1073
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:25,120
What am I proposing? I think we
all should do some damn proposing.

1074
01:09:25,121 --> 01:09:26,538
The crawlspace in the ceiling.

1075
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:28,665
We could go up,
barricade ourselves in.

1076
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:31,376
The only way up is the hatch,
and we could nail that shut.

1077
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:32,877
You must be out of your fuckin' mind.

1078
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:35,004
I'm not barricading
myself in no damn roof.

1079
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,257
Shit, I'd rather take
my chances with the cars.

1080
01:09:37,258 --> 01:09:38,842
We need a way to fight them.

1081
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:40,969
How about this?

1082
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,345
What is that?

1083
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:45,223
It's nitric acid.
Pretty much destroy anything.

1084
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:47,685
Yeah, but there's not--
not enough of it, Ernie.

1085
01:09:57,528 --> 01:09:59,155
It hurts!

1086
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,866
It hurts more than
you can imagine.

1087
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:04,201
I know.

1088
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,665
Freddy!

1089
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:22,511
I can finally see

1090
01:10:23,304 --> 01:10:24,763
the one thing

1091
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:28,975
the one thing that can relieve
this horrible suffering.

1092
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,060
What, Freddy? What?

1093
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,146
Live brains!

1094
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:09,140
Let's go.

1095
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:19,776
Get the girl!

1096
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:23,989
Run!

1097
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,868
Put her on the couch.

1098
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:31,163
They got Freddy.

1099
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:35,291
It was horrible, ugly, man.

1100
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,335
His face was all fucked up.

1101
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:38,504
His face--

1102
01:11:40,631 --> 01:11:41,923
He's not Freddy.

1103
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:44,218
Brains. Brains. Brains.

1104
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:48,555
Make her shut up. Make her shut up!

1105
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,141
Brains.

1106
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:54,353
Brains. Brains. Brains.

1107
01:12:01,402 --> 01:12:02,736
Shit, he's trying to get out.

1108
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:05,155
Get a bench, come on.

1109
01:12:08,993 --> 01:12:10,326
Ernie!

1110
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:11,870
Ernie, out of the way!

1111
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:18,043
Bring it against it. It's all right.

1112
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:21,587
I can't.

1113
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,506
Yes, you can. Get up!

1114
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:26,134
We can't stay here, man. It's
gonna bust through that door.

1115
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:27,970
We got to run for the cars.

1116
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:30,930
There's zombies all
over the cars outside.

1117
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:33,975
Got to fight our way through
them, there's no other way.

1118
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:37,228
Once we're in the car and moving,
I think we'll be all right.

1119
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:40,023
That's a big fucking "if," man.

1120
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:43,609
I can't walk, much less run.

1121
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,362
How bad is your foot, Ernie?

1122
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:47,865
Broke.

1123
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:01,252
Spider and I'll get one of the cars,
we'll bring it up near the door.

1124
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:03,380
Police car. It should still
have the keys in the ignition.

1125
01:13:05,007 --> 01:13:07,050
Son of a bitch.
The motor is still running.

1126
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:08,426
Good. I'll drive.

1127
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:11,262
- No, I'll drive.
- Hey, fuck you.

1128
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:14,265
When we drive up, I don't want to
hang out there longer than necessary.

1129
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:17,101
Young lady, you stand right here.
Put one hand here, one hand here.

1130
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:19,228
When I say "now,"
you open that door fast.

1131
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:22,106
The minute we're through, you
slam that door hard and lock it.

1132
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:23,316
Ernie,

1133
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:25,903
get your ass over here at the door.

1134
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:34,285
Burt...

1135
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:38,123
That favor that you owe me.
Watch your ass out there.

1136
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:43,545
All right, you stand by.

1137
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:49,343
Now!

1138
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:57,810
Run! Run!

1139
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:00,687
Get 'em!

1140
01:14:15,828 --> 01:14:18,287
You got to get closer, man.
They'll never make it like this.

1141
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:19,705
We got to split. We got to split.

1142
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:21,125
No, we can't split.

1143
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:30,299
They left us, those jerks!

1144
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,717
They left us!

1145
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:33,053
They had to.

1146
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:36,181
Burt will send help.

1147
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:38,891
I know him.

1148
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,269
They left us.

1149
01:14:41,812 --> 01:14:43,688
What are you doing?
We can't just leave 'em!

1150
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:45,440
They'd have turned the
goddamn car over.

1151
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:46,607
We'll send help.

1152
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,568
Bullshit! Those are my fucking friends.

1153
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:50,153
I said we'll send help, man.

1154
01:14:50,154 --> 01:14:52,156
- Coward!
- Fuck you!

1155
01:14:54,992 --> 01:14:56,326
Hang on, here we go!

1156
01:14:58,245 --> 01:14:59,996
What the fuck are we
gonna do now?

1157
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:01,581
Find a phone, call the cops.

1158
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:03,040
What the fuck?

1159
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,209
Jesus H. Christ!

1160
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,587
Shit!

1161
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:13,886
Back to the warehouse!

1162
01:15:17,848 --> 01:15:19,057
Shit!

1163
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:26,397
This way, you stupid honky!

1164
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:28,065
That's Spider.

1165
01:15:30,152 --> 01:15:31,777
Shit!
Hey, Spider!

1166
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:33,029
Hey, hey! Where is everybody?

1167
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,030
I don't know.

1168
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:36,116
- Who's he?
- He owns this place.

1169
01:15:37,034 --> 01:15:38,784
That fucking car is totaled, man.

1170
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:41,329
That's all right. My car is
still out there. So is Frank's.

1171
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:44,958
Not anymore.

1172
01:16:16,532 --> 01:16:18,075
Tina!

1173
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:21,328
Tina!

1174
01:16:22,287 --> 01:16:24,289
Tina, where are you?

1175
01:16:42,099 --> 01:16:43,392
Forgive me.

1176
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:29,604
- Brains!
- Cops! Get 'em!

1177
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,776
<i>Ground, this is air 3,
we got a bad situation.</i>

1178
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:37,111
<i>We've got officers down.</i>

1179
01:17:37,112 --> 01:17:40,032
<i>We have just witnessed ground
units attacked. Repeat, attacked.</i>

1180
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,158
Helicopter!

1181
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,494
Attention. Attention. This is the police.

1182
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:48,122
This area is under police blockade.

1183
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:50,041
All persons within this area

1184
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:51,792
wishing to surrender
should make their way

1185
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:53,879
to the perimeter at once.

1186
01:17:54,588 --> 01:17:56,422
Jesus.

1187
01:17:56,423 --> 01:17:59,091
It sounds like the shit's
really hitting the fan out there.

1188
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:00,593
Man, we got to let
them know we're in here.

1189
01:18:00,594 --> 01:18:02,011
You better believe it.

1190
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:03,388
Hey, mister!

1191
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:06,265
Don't go in there.

1192
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,685
There's a thing in there,
and it ripped out the phone.

1193
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:11,354
There's another phone in the basement.

1194
01:18:11,355 --> 01:18:13,773
The basement's fucked!
You know what's in the basement?

1195
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:16,025
- What do you mean?
- One of those corpses, man.

1196
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:18,944
A real ugly one, all black and slimy.

1197
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:22,198
I don't give a shit what's in the
basement, we got to get to that phone.

1198
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:24,617
Blinding them seems to
work okay, doesn't it?

1199
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:27,996
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1200
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,500
Spider, open the door.

1201
01:18:32,376 --> 01:18:34,752
I'm going to knock
his goddamn block off.

1202
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:38,172
Tina, it was wrong for
you to lock me up.

1203
01:18:38,173 --> 01:18:40,841
I had to hurt myself to get out.

1204
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:43,552
But I forgive you, darling.

1205
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,888
And I know you're here,

1206
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:48,683
because I can smell your brains.

1207
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:51,352
Go away!

1208
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:53,146
I'm coming up, Tina.

1209
01:18:59,403 --> 01:19:00,612
Freddy!

1210
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:05,450
Freddy!

1211
01:19:06,284 --> 01:19:07,660
See?

1212
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:10,621
And now you made me
hurt myself again.

1213
01:19:10,622 --> 01:19:14,084
You made me break my hand
completely off this time, Tina.

1214
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:18,421
But I don't care, darling,

1215
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:21,006
because I love you.

1216
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:25,470
And you've got to let
me eat your brain.

1217
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:39,985
Open the goddamn door.

1218
01:19:45,115 --> 01:19:46,533
Brains!

1219
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,121
Get him down.

1220
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:56,042
All right, you guys, go.
Get in there, come on, fast. Get in!

1221
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:02,799
Watch it, the step's out.

1222
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,850
Jesus Christ.

1223
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:17,314
That's our friend.
The Tarman got him.

1224
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:28,199
Yeah. Give me the police.

1225
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,659
It's an emergency, operator.

1226
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,411
Captain, over here.

1227
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:33,955
Two more cars around the side.

1228
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:38,209
Yes, go ahead.

1229
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,044
Yeah, you've got to help us.

1230
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:42,588
There's a bunch of us trapped inside
your barricade, and we can't get out.

1231
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:45,216
First of all, mister, what the
hell is going on in there?

1232
01:20:45,217 --> 01:20:48,385
I lost a dozen good men,
and nobody can tell me jack shit.

1233
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:50,095
There are people in the cemetery

1234
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:51,555
who are stark, staring mad.

1235
01:20:51,556 --> 01:20:53,182
They'll kill you and eat you.

1236
01:20:53,183 --> 01:20:55,851
It's like a disease, like
rabies, only faster. A lot faster.

1237
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:57,686
That's why you got
to come in here now

1238
01:20:57,687 --> 01:20:59,855
and get us the
hell out of here. Please!

1239
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:03,108
Just a minute, I can't hear you.
There's a lot of noise out here.

1240
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,486
Hey, what the hell's going on?

1241
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:07,947
Halt! I said halt!

1242
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:10,115
- Watch it.
- They're crazy!

1243
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:16,456
Oh, shit!

1244
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:19,417
- No!
- Fuckers!

1245
01:21:27,092 --> 01:21:29,218
- What?
- What is it?

1246
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:34,932
Cops. They've got the cops.

1247
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:36,976
That means they're breaking
out of the barricade.

1248
01:21:36,977 --> 01:21:38,645
Jesus Christ.

1249
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,404
What's he doing?

1250
01:21:48,572 --> 01:21:50,447
What are you doing?

1251
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:51,408
Shh.

1252
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,455
<i>Hello?</i>

1253
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:02,418
Yeah, I'm calling the number
stenciled on the side of the tank.

1254
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,336
<i>Your name, please?</i>

1255
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:05,462
Burt Wilson.

1256
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,632
<i>Stay on the line, Mr. Wilson.
You're being transferred.</i>

1257
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:11,051
<i>This is Com-Q,
Denver, go ahead.</i>

1258
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:15,180
<i>Denver, this is Wichita. I've got a
C-L-Y priority on a 1-1-3. Who's up?</i>

1259
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:18,142
<i>That would be Col. Glover,
San Diego. I'll put you through.</i>

1260
01:22:21,646 --> 01:22:22,856
Yes?

1261
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:25,358
Yes, Captain.

1262
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:29,528
- I see. Very well.
- Horace.

1263
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:32,197
- Put the call through to me.
- What is it?

1264
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,409
Yes, yes, put him on.

1265
01:22:36,036 --> 01:22:38,830
Mr. Wilson, where are
you calling from?

1266
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,251
I see. When did this take place?

1267
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,546
And when was the tank first breached?

1268
01:22:47,839 --> 01:22:49,758
Why didn't you call
this number immediately?

1269
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:54,387
I see. It's understandable.
Wh-what happened next?

1270
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:56,848
Uh-huh.

1271
01:22:57,641 --> 01:23:00,435
Oh, you did? And what
effect did that have?

1272
01:23:01,853 --> 01:23:02,979
I see.

1273
01:23:04,522 --> 01:23:06,316
So, uh, what did you do then?

1274
01:23:08,652 --> 01:23:10,445
And what did they do?

1275
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,656
I see.

1276
01:23:14,866 --> 01:23:18,244
Really? How many did you say?

1277
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:22,958
And how many acres does
this cemetery cover, sir?

1278
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:24,960
Yes.

1279
01:23:26,086 --> 01:23:27,253
I see.

1280
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,129
I see.

1281
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,215
Yes, I see. Of course.

1282
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:33,509
Uh, thank you for your
assistance, Mr. Wilson.

1283
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:36,262
I'm going to switch you back to
Captain Turner now. He'll talk to you.

1284
01:24:06,793 --> 01:24:09,420
Sir, this is Col. Glover.

1285
01:24:09,421 --> 01:24:13,507
I'm sorry to disturb you at this
hour, but we're at Q-2 status.

1286
01:24:13,508 --> 01:24:17,553
It looks like we've found that
lost consignment of Easter eggs.

1287
01:24:19,764 --> 01:24:21,765
Yes, sir, pretty sure.

1288
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:23,475
They've turned up in Louisville.

1289
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:26,771
I'm getting confirmations on this
from the Louisville Police Department.

1290
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:29,941
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

1291
01:24:31,735 --> 01:24:33,569
Well, sir, it would be good news,

1292
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:36,196
except that the eggs have hatched.

1293
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:37,823
What are they doing, man?

1294
01:24:37,824 --> 01:24:39,658
Hang on a second, would you?

1295
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:41,660
I dunno. It's weird.
These people seem to say

1296
01:24:41,661 --> 01:24:43,620
th-they've been waiting
for this to happen.

1297
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:45,289
Apparently, they've got some sort of

1298
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:47,041
contingency plan to deal with it.

1299
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:48,542
Well, that's great!

1300
01:24:48,543 --> 01:24:49,836
What is this plan?

1301
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:56,633
Sgt. Jefferson, 42nd Special
Mobile Artillery. Yes, sir.

1302
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:58,303
Good morning to you, too, sir.

1303
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:01,764
Yes, sir. All right, sir.

1304
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:04,349
Whatever you say, sir.
The code numbers please, sir.

1305
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:07,061
Archimedes. Hotdog. Rhubarb.

1306
01:25:07,062 --> 01:25:10,023
Niner. Zero. Niner. Gotcha, sir.

1307
01:25:11,149 --> 01:25:13,692
<i>Bearing. Mark 2-2-0.</i>

1308
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:16,071
Bearing,
2-2-0.

1309
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:21,617
<i>Range. Mark 134 miles.</i>

1310
01:25:21,618 --> 01:25:24,204
Range,
1-3-4 miles.

1311
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:41,346
Hey, listen.

1312
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:44,349
You hear anything?

1313
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:48,061
Tina-a-a-a.

1314
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:08,956
Spectacular result, sir.

1315
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:10,792
Very close to optimal placement.

1316
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:14,878
Well, sir, only 20
square blocks destroyed.

1317
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:16,880
Less than 4,000 dead, General.

1318
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:19,133
I wouldn't worry about
the fires, General.

1319
01:26:19,134 --> 01:26:21,219
The rain is taking
care of that right now.

1320
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:24,429
Well, there have been
complaints about burning skin,

1321
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:26,098
but I shouldn't worry.

1322
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:28,100
Minor irritation, General.

1323
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:30,144
The rain will wash everything away.

1324
01:26:30,145 --> 01:26:33,730
That's correct, sir. All should
be back to normal by morning.

1325
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:35,315
Yes, sir, I understand the President

1326
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:37,192
will visit Louisville tomorrow.

1327
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:39,362
No, no, we wouldn't
want that to happen, sir.

1328
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,782
No, sir, this hasn't been
very pleasant for anyone.

1329
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:46,827
Thank you, sir. Goodnight, sir.

1330
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:58,715
? Do you wanna party ?

1331
01:27:00,175 --> 01:27:01,676
? It's partytime ?

1332
01:27:01,843 --> 01:27:03,803
More brains!

1333
01:27:04,137 --> 01:27:07,056
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill it!

1334
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:11,059
It's all over everything.

1335
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,811
Stupid asshole!

1336
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:14,479
Watch your tongue,
if you like this job.

1337
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,523
Like this job?

1338
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,484
Burt? Frank.

1339
01:27:19,485 --> 01:27:21,236
We have a little problem.

1340
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:24,698
Ahh!

1341
01:27:24,699 --> 01:27:26,826
Do you ever fantasize

1342
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:29,621
about being killed?

1343
01:27:30,872 --> 01:27:31,997
Yeah!

1344
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:33,290
The brain! The brain!

1345
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:35,250
I hit the fucking brain.

1346
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:36,710
How do you kill something
that's already dead?

1347
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:39,546
Well, how do I know, Fred?
I don't know, let me think.

1348
01:27:39,547 --> 01:27:40,923
It's not a bad question, Burt.

1349
01:27:40,924 --> 01:27:42,466
What do you think this is about?

1350
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:45,636
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life!

1351
01:27:45,637 --> 01:27:47,221
Man, there's 100 of those fuckers.

1352
01:27:47,222 --> 01:27:48,931
100?

1353
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,850
Brains!

1354
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:54,770
Send more cops.

1355
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:55,938
Goddamn!

1356
01:27:55,939 --> 01:27:58,608
I-I-I think things are
getting out of hand.

1357
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:00,442
Oh!

1358
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:05,113
Get it off! Get it off!

1359
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:06,490
It worked in the movie.

1360
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:07,824
Well, it ain't working now.

1361
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:09,618
You mean the movie lied?

1362
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:16,709
It's not a bad question, Burt.

1363
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:20,254
? Tonight ?

1364
01:28:20,255 --> 01:28:23,800
? We'll make love till we die ?

1365
01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:41,984
? Ooh, baby, your ?
? asphalt eater hung ten ?

1366
01:28:41,985 --> 01:28:45,445
? The hoedads and gremmies ?
? say you reached top end ?

1367
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:48,991
? So do the dead, through the lights ?

1368
01:28:48,992 --> 01:28:52,703
? The surfin' dead, ooh, make it tight ?

1369
01:28:52,704 --> 01:28:56,248
? The livin' dead, now, ?
? baby, lose their heads ?

1370
01:28:56,249 --> 01:28:58,501
? Now, baby, doin' the dead ?

1371
01:29:10,138 --> 01:29:15,600
? You square brain's out ?
? there, better beware ?

1372
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:19,730
? Oh, this phantom driver ?
? down in the ground ?

1373
01:29:19,731 --> 01:29:23,942
? You better plant 'em right ?
? or they'll come around ?

1374
01:29:23,943 --> 01:29:27,237
? Move out, baby, move that mound ?

1375
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:30,907
? Or they'll dig it up ?
? and they'll shut you down ?

1376
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:36,496
? So c'mon, aw c'mon, aw c'mon ?

1377
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:39,833
? Aw c'mon, aw c'mon ?

1378
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:47,834
? Aw c'mon, aw c'mon ?
? aw c'mon, aw c'mon ?

1379
01:29:54,766 --> 01:29:57,642
? Now, life is short and ?
? it's filled with stuff ?

1380
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:01,396
? So let me know, baby, ?
? when you've had enough ?

1381
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:04,483
? Oh, do the dead, turn blue ?

1382
01:30:04,484 --> 01:30:08,904
? Yeah, the surfin' ?
? dead, as dead as you ?

1383
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:13,116
? There's nothing on the ?
? radio when you're dead ?

1384
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:15,285
? There's nothing at the movie show ?

1385
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:17,079
? When you're dead ?

1386
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,955
? There's nowhere left for you to go ?

1387
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:20,499
? When you're dead ?

1388
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:23,418
? Do the dead, yeah, do the dead ?

1389
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:26,756
? Do the dead ?
