JULY 3, 1984
5.30 PM EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME

5
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:32,936
Hey, Frank! It's time to go home.
What do you say?

6
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:37,375
I got another hour's work to do. The kid's
gonna stay and I'll show him the ropes.

7
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,495
You lock up for me before you go? Fourth
of July weekend, buddy boy. I gotta move.

8
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:45,654
Oh, yeah. Well, you have a nice Fourth
and I'll see you Sunday at the barbecue.

9
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:48,054
You'd better believe it.

10
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:51,093
Kid, I wanna tell you something
and I mean this sincerely.

11
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:54,293
No matter what happens,
don't name it after me.

12
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:58,332
Take it easy, Frank!

13
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,451
That Burt's a joker. OK, Freddy,
follow me and learn something.

14
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,691
We got an order from the St Louis
University Medical School.

15
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:12,290
They want two adult female skeletons
with perfect teeth. That's two AF-PT.

16
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,449
OK, so you come over here to
the A section. That's A for adult, see.

17
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:18,609
That's divided up into two sections.

18
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,808
- The M for male and the F for?
- Female.

19
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,808
Good boy. Now, the PT.

20
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:27,407
You might think that's
"pretty tough", but no.

21
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:29,647
- Perfect teeth.
- Very good.

22
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:32,846
Now, you get some excelsior
and lay it in that crate.

23
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,566
Make a nice little beddy-bye
for this little lady.

24
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:38,645
OK?

25
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:43,005
Good. We want her to be comfortable.
Help me get her in. Grab her legs.

26
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:44,484
OK.

27
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,684
Now you get some of that
Styrofoam popcorn.

28
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:49,883
Spread it all around.

29
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:54,203
Don't be stingy. Uncle Burt's
paying for this. More, Freddy, more.

30
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,922
OK, that's fine. Now, spread it around.

31
00:01:57,882 --> 00:02:02,321
That's right. You're doing very nice work.
You'll be fine in the warehouse business.

32
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:04,721
Frank, where do we get
these skeletons from?

33
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,761
- Oh, from India.
- India?

34
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:10,200
International treaty.
All skeletons come from India.

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,840
- No kidding. How come?
- How the hell do I know?

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,919
The important thing is, where do they get
all the skeletons with perfect teeth?

37
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,998
I'm going to ask you a serious question.
How many people you know die

38
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:24,318
with a beautiful, perfect set of choppers
in their puss, huh?

39
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:28,757
- Nobody I can think of.
- I think there's a skeleton farm in India.

40
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:31,157
Jesus!

41
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,756
Come on, kid. Follow your uncle here.

42
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:39,075
Here we go. I don't have to tell you
what these are for. Ba, ba, ba, boom!

43
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,195
Here we've got the prosthetic devices
all around here.

44
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,674
Look under here. Wheelchairs.

45
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:50,393
Now, Freddy, here's something you don't
see very often. You're a privileged person.

46
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:54,073
These are split dogs.
Yep, for veterinarian schools.

47
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:57,272
- We get a lot of orders for split dogs.
- That's really rad.

48
00:02:57,392 --> 00:02:59,872
Don't fool around. You're learning.

49
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:03,511
Over here, Freddy, is where
we keep the fresh cadavers.

50
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:08,630
We sell these to medical schools
and to the US Army for ballistic tests.

51
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,149
Well, say hello.

52
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:30,107
We usually get more inventory than this,
but we'll have a shipment on Monday.

53
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,746
How many bodies are in here usually?

54
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,666
Well, you don't want to be overstocked.
It's like the restaurant business.

55
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:41,145
You don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

56
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:48,584
Tell you what I'll do, kid. Teach you
how to fill out these shipping forms.

57
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,663
Look alive.

58
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:58,622
- Are we gonna party tonight or what?
- Yeah, we are.

59
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:00,262
Well, where?

60
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,501
- I don't know.
- We could go to the park.

61
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,261
The cops said they'd shoot us
if we go back in the park.

62
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:08,180
- I ain't in no mood to die tonight.
- I like death.

63
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,020
I like death with sex.
How about you, Casey?

64
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,820
- Yeah. Fuck off and die.
- Where we gonna party, Tina?

65
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,939
Oh, you guys, I'm meeting Freddy
when he gets off work.

66
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:20,138
- Where you meeting him?
- At this medical supply warehouse.

67
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,218
Oh, no! He got a job? What a dick!

68
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,898
Well, shit! Why didn't you say so?
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

69
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:28,217
Freddy always knows where to party.

70
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:39,895
- Frank?
- Yeah, kid?

71
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,095
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

72
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:50,413
Kid, I have seen weird things come
and I have seen weird things go,

73
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:54,573
but the weirdest thing I ever saw
just had to cap it all.

74
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,132
Oh, yeah? What's that?

75
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:59,612
Let me ask you a question, kid.

76
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:04,411
<i>Did you see that movie
Night of the Living Dead?</i>

77
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:10,050
Yeah. That's the one where the corpses
start eatin' the people. What about it?

78
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,890
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

79
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,569
- Come on. You're shittin' me, right?
- I've never been more serious in my life.

80
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,208
That's not possible. They showed
zombies takin' over the world.

81
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:27,407
Well, they changed it all around.
What really happened was,

82
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,487
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh
at the VA hospital,

83
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:38,246
there was a chemical spill and all that
stuff kinda leaked down into the morgue,

84
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:42,485
and it made all the dead bodies
kinda jump around as though it was alive.

85
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:46,804
- What chemical?
- 245 trioxin, it's called.

86
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:50,084
It was to kinda spray on
marijuana or something,

87
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:54,403
and the Darrow Chemical Company
was trying to develop it for the army.

88
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:59,842
They told the guy who made the movie
that, if he told the true story,

89
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:04,081
they'd just sue his ass off.
So he changed all the facts around.

90
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,761
So what really happened?

91
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,360
Well, they closed it all down, see.

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,879
The army shipped all that contaminated
dirt and all those dead bodies out.

93
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:19,079
And they kept it a secret. Shh!

94
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,558
Well, so how come you know about it?

95
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:26,837
Well, typical army fuck-up.

96
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:30,677
The transportation department
got the orders crossed.

97
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:35,076
They shipped those bodies here,

98
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:38,036
instead of to the Darrow
Chemical Company.

99
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,074
Hello.

100
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:46,594
Oh, hi, honey.

101
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:50,554
No, I'll be home in about an hour.
You keep the pot roast hot, OK?

102
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,073
Yeah, sure. I love you too, honey.

103
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:55,873
Yeah. Kiss, kiss.

104
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:03,071
Wanna see 'em?

105
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,991
- See 'em?
- The corpses.

106
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,470
- What are you talkin' about?
- They're down in the basement.

107
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,110
No.

108
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,709
- Come on.
- No way.

109
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:24,948
Hey, mind the third step. It's a bitch.

110
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:29,107
- You mean they just left the bodies here?
- Well, you know the army.

111
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:31,507
And they've been here all this time?

112
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,986
14 years, as I recall.

113
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:37,186
No kidding.

114
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:41,225
There they are.

115
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,505
There's bodies in there?

116
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:03,342
Oh, shit. Look at that.

117
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,581
- You say that thing was alive?
- So they say.

118
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,259
Oh, God! Hey, these things
don't leak, do they?

119
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,379
Leak? Hell, no. These things were made
by the US Army Corps of Engineers.

120
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,498
Oh, fuck!

121
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,512
Hello, dear. How was your day?

122
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:03,712
- The usual. Crap.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

123
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,991
- What's for dinner?
- Your favorite. Lamb chops.

124
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:09,471
I had them for lunch.

125
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:34,027
Yes, it's me, checking in from Station 3
at 1600... Make that 1601 hours.

126
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,306
I'll be home all evening. Right.

127
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,263
It's nerve-racking to live around
that equipment all the time.

128
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:57,103
They have to be able to reach me
24 hours a day, wherever I am.

129
00:11:57,223 --> 00:12:01,782
- All that microwave stuff affects my oven.
- When we find them, it can be taken out.

130
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:05,901
- But when will you find them?
- Christ, Ethel! I don't know!

131
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,421
Maybe we'll never find them.

132
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,819
We've been through all this before.
They could be anywhere.

133
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,819
7.30 PM EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME

134
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:25,698
- Where the fuck are we goin'?
- To party.

135
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:28,818
- To pick up Freddy.
- What is Freddy up to these days?

136
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:31,097
- He got himself a job.
- No shit! What job?

137
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,737
- He's a stockroom clerk.
- Sounds like a shitty job.

138
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:37,096
It isn't the President of the USA,
but at least he can buy stuff.

139
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:41,255
- Maybe he'll buy something from me.
- He don't like your kind of stuff, Suicide.

140
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,655
How come you only come around
when you need a ride?

141
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,775
Cos you're one spooky motherfucker.

142
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:49,534
- You think I'm spooky, huh?
- Oh, my God!

143
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:02,292
Man, what a hideous, ugly place.

144
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:04,372
I like it. It's a statement.

145
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,211
- Come on. Let's go get the prick.
- No.

146
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:10,091
- It might freak out his boss.
- Well, that's not nice.

147
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,770
What does he think we are?
Weird or somethin'?

148
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,970
- What time does Freddy get off?
- 10 o'clock.

149
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,369
- I ain't sittin' here two fuckin' hours.
- We could drive around.

150
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,849
I don't got gas.
You wanna buy some gas, idiot?

151
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:23,568
- I was kidding.
- We could go fool around in there.

152
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,968
- You mean that cemetery?
- Oh...

153
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,048
Oh, let's do that.

154
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:47,884
What do you wanna do, Scuz?
Turn over gravestones?

155
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:51,764
I just want to look around the graveyard.
I ain't never seen one before.

156
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:54,883
- Ain't you been to a funeral?
- I never knew nobody that died.

157
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:56,723
This isn't such a good idea.

158
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:58,643
- What's that?
- Road flares, asswipe.

159
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:01,122
- What do you want with those?
- I just wanna party.

160
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:03,202
What are the road flares for?

161
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,400
This place is a mess.

162
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,679
- It looks like your pad, Scuz.
- I heard that.

163
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:38,516
Frank!

164
00:14:54,873 --> 00:14:57,193
You OK, kid?

165
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,313
I don't know. I don't feel so good.

166
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,152
Christ, what a stink.

167
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:10,271
- What the hell happened to the body?
- Must have melted when it hit the air.

168
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,590
Close the goddamn thing.

169
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,188
Christ, I never smelled
anything like that before.

170
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,068
I think I'm gonna be sick.

171
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:53,944
I don't guess we'd better tell Burt
about this. It makes us look stupid.

172
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:58,463
I can still smell that stuff. It must be
in my nose or all over everything.

173
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,742
Yeah, I'd better spray
some deodorant around here.

174
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,900
What was that?

175
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,859
- Sounds like a dog.
- A dog?

176
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,178
Wait a second. Listen, listen.

177
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:28,578
- You hear that?
- What the hell's goin' on here?

178
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,815
What's wrong with him?

179
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,495
Oh, shit!

180
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,574
What are we gonna do?

181
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,334
Oh, we're gonna kill it! I'm gonna kill it!

182
00:16:54,494 --> 00:16:56,613
What are you doing? Stop!

183
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:04,412
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

184
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:10,251
- Are we fucked? What's happening?
- It's the cadaver, the cadaver.

185
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:14,050
- Oh, fuck. What's it doin' in there?
- I don't know. It sounds sore.

186
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,570
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- Lock it in.

187
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,889
Oh, Jesus!

188
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,169
Hurry! Jesus Christ!

189
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,648
We gotta think, we gotta think!
Come on, son. Get in there.

190
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:33,727
- Are we goin' crazy?
- No, it's that crap from the tanks.

191
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:37,446
- That chemical is all over everything.
- Stupid asshole!

192
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:40,886
- Watch your tongue if you like this job!
- Like this job?

193
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:43,565
- Well, think! Think!
- We gotta tell the cops.

194
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:46,525
No, no. You know what the cops
would do to this company?

195
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:50,244
- Who cares about the company?
- Well, think of our reputation.

196
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:51,804
Think! Think!

197
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:56,203
What about the number on the tank?
It said to call it in case of an emergency.

198
00:17:56,323 --> 00:18:01,442
No, that's the army! You don't want
the goddamn army around here. Think!

199
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,882
- What are we gonna do?
- What are we gonna do?

200
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:06,362
We're gonna call the boss.

201
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,919
Burt? Frank.

202
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,279
We have a little problem.

203
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,238
Do you ever fantasize...
about being killed?

204
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:31,677
Never.

205
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:38,876
Do you ever wonder about all the different
ways of dying... you know, violently,

206
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:43,475
and wonder, like, what would be
the most horrible way to die?

207
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:47,555
- I try not to think about dyin' too much.
- Mmm.

208
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:51,354
Well, for me,

209
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:56,953
the worst way would be
for a bunch of old men

210
00:18:57,073 --> 00:19:03,552
to get around me
and start biting and eating me alive.

211
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,472
I see.

212
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:09,311
First, they would tear off my clothes.

213
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:14,390
Let's get some light over here.
Trash is taking off her clothes again.

214
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:36,507
That's Trash. Go, baby.

215
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,466
Are you high on anything?

216
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,343
You did what? You opened it?
You stupid moron! You idiot!

217
00:19:56,463 --> 00:20:00,343
Haven't I always told you never even
to go near those goddamn tanks?

218
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:04,782
What are we gonna do, Burt?

219
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:07,262
I'm gonna be sued by
the Darrow Chemical Company

220
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:09,781
and investigated by the government.

221
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:13,781
I might even lose my business.
I might even go to jail, goddamn it!

222
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,259
On the other hand, if we destroy
all this evidence around here,

223
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:26,298
- we keep our mouth shut...
- That's it! Let's do that, Burt!

224
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:30,778
Yeah, right. That's what we gotta do.

225
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:35,897
One question, Frank. This guy screaming
in here, you sure he's a dead cadaver?

226
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,216
Why don't you open the door
and find out?

227
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,576
It's all right. I'll take your word for that.

228
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:45,655
If it is a reanimated body,
we're gonna have to... we'll have to kill it.

229
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,735
- How do you kill it if it's already dead?
- How do I know, Fred? Let me think.

230
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,254
It's not a bad question, Burt.

231
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:55,294
In that movie, they destroyed
the brain to kill 'em.

232
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,373
The brains, right!

233
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:01,773
- What do doctors use to crack skulls?
- Surgical drills.

234
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,892
Hold this, Frank. Listen to me, both of
you. Freddy, you gotta open that door.

235
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:10,571
You stand right here, Frank, and when it
comes out, you brain him with that axe.

236
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,171
Oh, Jesus!

237
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:16,010
How am I gonna stop it from moaning?
What's the matter with you, Frank?

238
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,130
Fred, come here. Stand by the door.
It's gonna be all right, son.

239
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,329
I don't think I can do this, Burt.

240
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:26,209
- Well, you better. You got us into this.
- Oh, Jesus!

241
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,968
Right, Freddy. 22, right.

242
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:36,207
- Oh...
- Be brave, Frank, goddamn it.

243
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,086
Four, left.

244
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,926
10, right.

245
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,843
Get him off, Frank!

246
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:14,760
Coming, Frank. Hold it!

247
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:23,399
Oh, what the hell's going on, Burt?

248
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,479
- The brain, the brain!
- I hit the fucking brain.

249
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,318
Then do something else,
for goddamn it to hell's sake!

250
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:32,678
Hold him down, Frank.

251
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:36,437
I can't stand this any longer!

252
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,557
- Oh, shit!
- Hold him down now.

253
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,036
What are you gonna do... Oh!

254
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:48,035
- Be a man, Frank. Be a man.
- I can't stand this, you son of a bitch.

255
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,675
Hurry up!

256
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:13,791
- I'll get him! I'll get him!
- I got him!

257
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:17,230
- Get a rope!
- Where the fuck's a rope?

258
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,990
- Hold him down!
- Hang on to the son of a bitch.

259
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,869
Christ! It ain't dyin'.

260
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:25,709
I thought you said
if we destroyed the brain, it'd die!

261
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:28,268
- It worked in the movie!
- It ain't workin' now.

262
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:31,428
You mean the movie lied? Oh, Jesus!

263
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:40,826
- How are we going to kill it?
- Maybe you can't. Maybe it won't die.

264
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:47,265
Then we just gotta destroy it
completely until nothing's left.

265
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:50,945
- Acid!
- What kinda acid would dissolve a body?

266
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:55,304
Sulphuric acid, maybe.
No, aqua regia. That's stronger.

267
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:59,543
But what if it doesn't dissolve everything,
like the bones?

268
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,623
Shit.

269
00:24:02,463 --> 00:24:04,422
What are we gonna do?

270
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:08,542
Burt! Where are you going?

271
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,141
Sometimes Ernie Kaltenbrunner
works late.

272
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:16,140
Who's Ernie Kaltenbrunner?

273
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,860
He's the embalmer at the mortuary
across the street.

274
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,139
- What the hell's he gonna do for us?
- His light's on. He's in.

275
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:27,339
Ernie's got a crematorium, Frank.

276
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:31,738
A crematorium, that's beautiful! You think
you can get him to go along with it?

277
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:35,897
I've known Ernie about 25 years. He might
do it out of friendship. I'm not sure.

278
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:40,096
What the hell are you gonna tell him?
Can you trust that bastard?

279
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:43,216
I don't think we have a choice, Frank.

280
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:46,895
How we... How we gonna get
this thing over there?

281
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:54,214
Give me the bone saw.

282
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:58,333
9.16 PM EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME

283
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:01,053
Why don't you put your clothes on?
The show's over.

284
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:04,092
What's the matter?
Does it make you nervous?

285
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,452
I'm hot.

286
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,571
- Yeah, you are hot.
- Scram, wimp.

287
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,010
Nobody understands me, you know that?

288
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,049
I fuckin' bust my ass for you guys
and what do I get?

289
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,169
"You're spooky. "

290
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,249
Fuck you, man. Fuck you all.

291
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:28,808
I like it, Spooky.

292
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:32,368
I mean, I got something to say.
What do you think this is about?

293
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:35,847
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life!

294
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,927
Oh, yes!

295
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:44,046
What's wrong with you, man? Show some
fuckin' respect for the dead, will ya?

296
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,765
- Is that Freddy?
- Where?

297
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:53,124
- Going into that building.
- No. That is not Freddy.

298
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:55,684
How would you know?

299
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,363
Why would Freddy
be going into a mortuary?

300
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:50,355
What do you say, Ernie?

301
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,474
Hey, Ernie.

302
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:00,633
- Whoa! Take it easy.
- Sorry. I didn't hear you.

303
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,313
Whoo! Fast on the draw.

304
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:10,631
- Working late tonight.
- Oh, yeah. Pretty much, kinda...

305
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:13,871
Oh, what time is it?
You want a cup of coffee?

306
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:17,150
- Uh, no, thank you. I'm all right.
- I do. I need it.

307
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,229
What, uh... what are you doing, Ernie?

308
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:26,869
- Breaking out the rigor mortis.
- Oh, yeah?

309
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:30,348
Come here.

310
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:35,067
Come on. You see,
rigor mortis starts in the brain,

311
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:39,987
and it spreads down to the internal organs
and finally settles in the muscles.

312
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,626
It, uh... loosens up after a while,

313
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:51,385
but, uh... you can break it out manually,
as they say, by flexing the muscles.

314
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:55,944
- Oh, boy. Look at that.
- You'll not find that in a book, my friend.

315
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:59,743
The embalming business is basically
passed on by word of mouth.

316
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:03,623
Well, that's fascinating, Ernie.
That's really something.

317
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:08,102
Well, he's dead now.

318
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,182
And I am bushed.

319
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:15,261
Hey, uh, buddy boy...

320
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:19,580
How long have we been friends, Ernie?
About how long?

321
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,939
25 years, give or take.

322
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:26,979
If I ask you a favor,
could you keep it quiet?

323
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,978
Sure. What is it?

324
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:33,218
Well, I'm gonna need some help, Ernie,
in a pretty big way, really.

325
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,457
You can depend on me. What's wrong?

326
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:39,057
I got a couple of my men here.
You mind if I...

327
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:41,616
Burt, no. Burt, that's illegal.

328
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,936
Can you can bring it in now, please?

329
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,655
Fred, you can put it right over here.
Right here.

330
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:52,175
All right, what is that?

331
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:57,574
- Right there, please.
- Here?

332
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:08,052
I gotta...

333
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:13,931
What the hell is in those bags?

334
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,451
Rabid weasels.

335
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:20,290
- What are you doing with rabid weasels?
- I was trying to explain, Ernie.

336
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,529
They're part of a shipment.
They weren't meant to be rabid,

337
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:27,129
- but you know how these things happen.
- No, I don't. How do they happen?

338
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:30,128
Well... Watch out, Ernie, don't get bit.

339
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:33,688
- We got 'em and we need your help.
- How?

340
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:37,847
- We gotta get rid of these things.
- Why don't you call an animal shelter?

341
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:41,366
Well, word'll get out, hurt my business.
That's a bad scene - rabies.

342
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:44,326
I don't think so. I mean, so what?

343
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:47,765
You don't run a pet store.
So some lab animals got rabies.

344
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:50,445
Come on. Guys, take 'em to the pound.

345
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,964
Well, I just can't do that.
You gotta... take my word for it.

346
00:29:56,924 --> 00:30:00,123
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- You have a crematorium.

347
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:03,163
- You wanna burn them?
- Yeah, that's what I had in mind.

348
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:06,162
- That's cruel.
- I can't think of anything else to do.

349
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:11,162
You... you just can't burn animals alive.
It's just too hideous.

350
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:16,441
At least let me kill 'em first. Take 'em
outside and put 'em out of their misery.

351
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,880
I don't think that'll work, Ernie.

352
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,280
I don't understand
what's goin' on. Why not?

353
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,558
- Can you swear to keep a secret, Ernie?
- At this point I don't know.

354
00:30:32,678 --> 00:30:36,357
No, you gotta swear. You got to,
or I just can't... I can't tell you.

355
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:39,277
All right. I swear.

356
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:41,357
Good.

357
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,436
It's not weasels in the bags.

358
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:51,075
No, no kidding. Look.

359
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,033
Get it off! Get it off!

360
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:05,513
Get it off! Get it off!

361
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:16,551
I'm sorry, Ernie.

362
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:29,189
Ernie, we got a...
we got a long story to tell you.

363
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,868
Oh, great. Some party.

364
00:31:31,988 --> 00:31:36,507
- What happened to Trash and Suicide?
- Probably getting it on somewhere.

365
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:40,267
Don't even think it, Chuck.

366
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:42,866
Oh, God. When's 10 o'clock gonna come?

367
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,146
Hey, if you wanna split,
we could both go somewhere.

368
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,825
You'd really like
to do it with me, wouldn't you?

369
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:54,264
Hey, I mean, a girl like you
and a guy like me...

370
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:58,864
- Go choke a chicken.
- Oh, come on, Casey. I was only kidding.

371
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:03,143
- Oh, great. Here's your friend and mine.
- Hey, fuck you, ball-buster!

372
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:07,462
Hey, my watch stopped. What time is it?

373
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:15,701
- Goin' on 10.
- Oh, fudge!

374
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:18,860
I'd better find Freddy.
He'll be getting off any time now.

375
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,460
- All right. Go ahead, we'll wait for you.
- Don't go anywhere, OK?

376
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,370
Come on, Freddy. Where are you?

377
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,089
Frankly, Burt, I think you acted
precipitously in cutting up the corpse.

378
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:31,728
Well, you may be right, but I did it.
So what are we gonna do about it, Ernie?

379
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:36,688
If I let you use the retort,
what's in it for me?

380
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:41,287
What do you want?

381
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:46,366
Well, uh... the way I see it,
this is a pretty big favor.

382
00:33:46,486 --> 00:33:51,005
Ernie, you got it. Whatever it is you want,
so help me, I'll do it. Promise.

383
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:56,244
I'm sorry about that.

384
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:21,480
All right, let's take care of your problem.

385
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,838
Yes, sirree.
You're gonna owe me a big one.

386
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:35,158
Buddy boy, you're gonna get
rid of everything. Is that right?

387
00:34:35,278 --> 00:34:37,237
Everything'll go.

388
00:34:41,317 --> 00:34:45,156
- What about the bones, Ernie?
- Bones are no problem.

389
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:47,436
The hardest thing to burn is the heart.

390
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:51,075
- The heart? Why?
- Cos it's just one big tough muscle.

391
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:54,795
Yeah, but, Ernie, we don't want
the heart sticking around.

392
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,954
- I'll turn it hotter for the heart.
- What about the split dogs?

393
00:34:59,074 --> 00:35:01,234
The split dogs will go too.

394
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,153
Just give me a hand. It's your mess.

395
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:17,991
Some big favor.
I could operate that goddamn thing.

396
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:24,190
Are you absolutely certain that this will
get rid of everything? I mean, nothing left.

397
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,069
- Nothing but a little pile of ashes.
- We don't even want ashes, Ernie.

398
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:31,748
Then I'll turn it up higher
and we'll burn up the ashes too.

399
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:37,468
Dust to dust.

400
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:35,858
- Oh, the radio is gonna get...
- Back to the car, dammit.

401
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:56,054
Freddy! Anybody!

402
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,654
Get the fuckin' top!

403
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:10,772
- Close the fuckin' windows, man!
- I don't have any windows. I busted 'em.

404
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:14,371
- Hey, my skin burns!
- Me too. Dammit!

405
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:17,891
- It's that rain. It's like acid rain.
- Suicide, start the car.

406
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:20,610
It's all over me.
Will somebody give me a towel?

407
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,130
We ain't got no towel.

408
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,810
- Come on, man. Start the car.
- I'm tryin'.

409
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:29,889
- Come on, start.
- Suicide, get the car goin'.

410
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:32,728
- I'm tryin'.
- Fuck!

411
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:35,008
I wonder what's in that rain.

412
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:51,005
<i>Look at it. It's coming down like
ein betrunkener Soldat.</i>

413
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:20,840
- Is the heart gone, Ernie?
- It's all burned up.

414
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,080
- Are you sure?
- Right up the chimney.

415
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,799
Goddamn, that's all we need.
We're home free, Frank. We got it made.

416
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:30,799
You saved our ass, buddy boy,
and I owe you one. Goddamn!

417
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:33,078
Yes, you do.

418
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:37,318
Let's get back to that warehouse, clean up
and get the hell outta there, Frank.

419
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:41,077
OK, just give me a second to rest,
catch my breath, then we'll do it, OK?

420
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:44,876
Frank, I don't know about you,
but I'm really sick.

421
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:46,676
What's wrong, Fred?

422
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:49,716
I feel like hell is what's wrong.
I'm really sick.

423
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:52,755
- I'm sick too, Burt.
- Sick, like how?

424
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:56,275
I feel like my head's
gonna bust wide open.

425
00:38:56,395 --> 00:39:00,554
And... and I wanna puke.
And I'm weak too.

426
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:05,113
Me too. I got the chills. It's that stuff, Burt.
It's that goddamn stuff we breathed.

427
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:07,193
What are you talking about, Frank?

428
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:12,512
When that canister cracked, this gas
squirted out. It hit us right in the face.

429
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:14,871
We breathed it.

430
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:18,831
It knocked us out. We were out cold,
unconscious for a while.

431
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,831
Oh, Christ! Ernie...

432
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,270
- Shouldn't we get to a doctor?
- Yeah, Burt. I need a doctor.

433
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,589
I'm taking these guys
to the emergency ward right now.

434
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:30,149
Let's go, Frank.
You're gonna be all right.

435
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:32,429
Hey, Frank! Frank!

436
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:42,107
What's the matter?

437
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:44,187
Get him out of the rain.

438
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,986
I gotta call my wife.
Then I'm gonna go to the hospital.

439
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,305
Sit down. You're too sick.

440
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:58,424
Frank, take it easy, take it easy.
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

441
00:39:58,544 --> 00:40:00,744
Paramedics. Paramedics.

442
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:14,742
Hello, yes. Can we get some
paramedics over here right away?

443
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:21,700
That's the Resurrection Funeral Home,
at 21702 East Central.

444
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,940
Well, tell 'em to come around the back
to the embalming room.

445
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:31,619
Oh, uh... poisoning.

446
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:34,298
We have two men poisoned here.

447
00:40:34,418 --> 00:40:37,858
Uh... Well, no, we don't know
what kind of poison.

448
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,417
Right.

449
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,497
Thank you very much. Bye.

450
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,137
Burt, they're on the way.

451
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:50,256
- This car ain't goin' nowhere.
- Dammit.

452
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:53,215
Sh! Do you hear something?

453
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:56,135
- Hear what?
- Something.

454
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,370
- No, I don't hear nothin'.
- This roof's leaking.

455
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,849
- There's a rip, dammit. Shit.
- Oh, don't do that!

456
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:32,129
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shit, Scuz!

457
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:34,528
Hello there!

458
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:37,168
Freddy?

459
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,687
Anybody?

460
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:59,124
Freddy! Are you here?

461
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:19,481
Anybody here?

462
00:42:42,837 --> 00:42:44,877
Who's there?

463
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:49,436
Brains!

464
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,195
Brains!

465
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:58,714
I gotta get outta here.
Let's go over where Tina and Freddy are.

466
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,954
- Damn right.
- Fuckin' A!

467
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:07,153
Live brains.

468
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:54,505
God! My skin's really burning!

469
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:07,823
- Hey, Tina!
- Yes! Oh, God! Help me!

470
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:10,303
- That's Tina.
- What's she yelling about?

471
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:12,742
Through that door!

472
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,862
Watch the fuckin' step!

473
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:20,421
What the fuck!

474
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,140
Brains!

475
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,897
More brains.

476
00:44:47,456 --> 00:44:51,016
Where the fuck you goin'?
Help me bar the door! Stupid fuckers!

477
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:09,533
It's them.

478
00:45:12,452 --> 00:45:15,132
- Who took the poison?
- Right over there.

479
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,210
Stick your tongue out for me.

480
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:34,809
- What did you guys take?
- It was some kind of industrial chemical.

481
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:38,448
- Something in a tank.
- What tank? Where?

482
00:45:39,008 --> 00:45:40,968
Well, we're not sure really.

483
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:44,207
Can you find out?
Your friends' lives may depend on it.

484
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:48,966
Well, I gotta make some phone calls,
but I can't do that before morning. Sorry.

485
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:51,246
Let's take some vital signs.

486
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:01,964
Can I borrow your stethoscope?
I can't hear anything through mine.

487
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:04,804
- Are you sure it's the equipment?
- What do you mean?

488
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:07,643
Well, I'm not getting
anything on this either.

489
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:10,643
What do you mean?
What's wrong? What's wrong?

490
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:14,682
It's all right. We just need
to double-check a couple of things.

491
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,160
- No blood pressure.
- No pulse.

492
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,799
- Well, what do you mean?
- Sh... Take it easy, take it easy.

493
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:39,118
- What do you have?
- 70.

494
00:46:39,238 --> 00:46:40,678
- 70 what?
- 70 degrees.

495
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,677
- Well, what's that?
- Room temperature.

496
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:47,996
Come over here for a second.
I want to talk to you.

497
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,315
What are you guys saying?
What are you guys saying?

498
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:02,074
- What was that thing down there?
- Hey, Suicide is down there.

499
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,234
No way, man. He is gone.
That thing ate his head. Jesus!

500
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:08,673
Shh! I don't hear
anything down there, do you?

501
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:11,113
- Oh, we gotta call somebody.
- Who?

502
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:14,992
- The cops.
- The cops are just gonna kick our ass.

503
00:47:15,112 --> 00:47:18,791
- Let's just get outta here, OK?
- Oh, we gotta call somebody.

504
00:47:18,911 --> 00:47:20,871
Wait a minute. Where's Freddy?

505
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:47,907
Holy shit! We'll have to swim
to get over there.

506
00:47:50,346 --> 00:47:53,826
- What the fuck was that?
- Look! The dead!

507
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:25,820
Hey, wait, you guys!

508
00:48:42,537 --> 00:48:44,977
You have no pulse,
blood pressure is zero over zero,

509
00:48:45,097 --> 00:48:47,297
you have no pupillary response,
no reflexes.

510
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:49,376
Your temperature is 70 degrees.

511
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:53,456
- Well, what does that mean?
- Well, it's a puzzle,

512
00:48:53,576 --> 00:48:55,615
because technically you're not alive.

513
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:58,575
Except you're conscious,
so we don't know what it means.

514
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:01,054
- You sayin' we're dead?
- Don't jump to conclusions.

515
00:49:01,174 --> 00:49:04,054
Obviously, I didn't mean
you were really dead.

516
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,414
Dead people don't
move around and talk.

517
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:09,293
- What's that, Ernie?
- The front door.

518
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,493
- What the fuck are they doing?
- I'll find out.

519
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:15,372
We're gonna get a couple of stretchers.
Hang in there. We won't be a second.

520
00:49:17,052 --> 00:49:19,451
- Open the door!
- Open the door, please!

521
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:26,850
- Open the door!
- Hurry up!

522
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,009
- Freeze or you're dead!
- Don't shoot, man!

523
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:33,089
Are you crazy? Are you on PCP?

524
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:38,248
- Nobody's on any joints. Just let us in.
- All right, come in. But no funny moves.

525
00:49:38,368 --> 00:49:41,368
You gotta lock everything
and call the cops! They're out there!

526
00:49:41,488 --> 00:49:43,847
- Who's out there?
- Don't you hear that?

527
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:47,127
Shut up and listen, man!

528
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,446
- What is that?
- It's dead people screamin'.

529
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:54,086
They came from out of the ground,
and they're after us.

530
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:55,405
Out of the ground?

531
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,285
Our friends went the other way,
and they're out there.

532
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:04,444
Brains! Brains!

533
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:07,043
Brains!

534
00:50:14,082 --> 00:50:15,482
Where's Trash?

535
00:50:15,602 --> 00:50:18,402
- Didn't she go with them?
- I thought she was with us!

536
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,361
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

537
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,600
Christ Jesus!

538
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,600
- What is that?
- Sounds like people screaming.

539
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:35,119
You get the stretchers.
I'll get on the radio and phone this in.

540
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,835
Jerry?

541
00:51:02,874 --> 00:51:04,834
Brains! Brains!

542
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,793
- What kind of a problem?
- Well, take a look at it.

543
00:51:10,913 --> 00:51:12,633
What the hell's goin' on?

544
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:16,072
Mister, that graveyard is full of
people comin' out of the ground.

545
00:51:16,192 --> 00:51:18,672
- What do you mean?
- Yes. Out of the ground.

546
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:21,911
- They're horrible and they scream.
- Scream?

547
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:25,350
Yes. And there's one of them in
that warehouse on the other side...

548
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,470
Which warehouse?

549
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,470
- The medical supply house.
- Oh, shit! Shit! Goddamn!

550
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,389
Burt, I think... I think
things are gettin' out of hand.

551
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:37,069
- There's a hundred of those things.
- A hundred?

552
00:51:37,189 --> 00:51:40,388
- The cops. We gotta call the cops.
- Yeah, no shit.

553
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:44,387
Phone? Where the fuck is the phone?

554
00:51:44,507 --> 00:51:46,467
There! There's an office.

555
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:54,306
Hello, operator. Give me the police.
This is an emergency.

556
00:51:59,665 --> 00:52:01,904
Get a hammer and nails! Casey!

557
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:05,904
Quiet! Let's just get
the hell outta here, Ernie.

558
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:07,583
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

559
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:10,823
- Get your keys and let's get outta here.
- My clutch is shot.

560
00:52:10,943 --> 00:52:13,662
We'll use the paramedic ambulance.

561
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:15,302
Freddy! Oh!

562
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:19,262
- Ernie, where are the paramedics?
- I'll go get them. Get my car started.

563
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:22,181
Oh, my God, Freddy,
what did they do to you?

564
00:53:03,374 --> 00:53:04,494
Oh, God!

565
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,214
What was that shooting, Ernie?

566
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,453
Oh...

567
00:53:09,573 --> 00:53:12,373
- Oh, God!
- What the hell?

568
00:53:12,493 --> 00:53:15,772
It... it... it...

569
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,852
"It" what? What is "it"?

570
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:20,371
They're all over the cars.

571
00:53:20,491 --> 00:53:23,051
Horrible. They're out there. They're...

572
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:27,770
Paramedics are dead,
and we can't take the cars. We...

573
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,610
Burt, we've gotta...
we've gotta call the police.

574
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,769
Set 'em down, set 'em down.

575
00:53:32,889 --> 00:53:35,209
Set 'em down, easy.

576
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,328
Not... not working. Not working.

577
00:53:39,288 --> 00:53:40,408
Come on.

578
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:58,605
- What's the matter?
- Dead.

579
00:54:10,323 --> 00:54:12,283
Help me.

580
00:54:19,082 --> 00:54:21,441
You got some hammer and nails?

581
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:45,317
- Where else can they get in here?
- The windows in the chapel.

582
00:55:09,153 --> 00:55:12,313
<i>Rescue 7, Rescue 7, come in.
This is Dispatch. Over.</i>

583
00:55:15,672 --> 00:55:18,992
<i>Rescue 7, come in. This is Dispatch.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

584
00:55:20,312 --> 00:55:22,271
Come in, Dispatch.

585
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:26,111
Send more paramedics.

586
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:44,468
- How many fuckin' windows you got?
- No more windows.

587
00:55:45,707 --> 00:55:50,587
- The embalming room has steel shutters.
- Let's get back to the embalming room.

588
00:55:55,346 --> 00:55:56,985
Man, my arms are dead.

589
00:55:57,105 --> 00:56:00,865
Put that goddamn thing down, Ernie,
before you hurt somebody. Jesus.

590
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:03,344
- How they doin'?
- Freddy, are you all right?

591
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:04,504
It hurts.

592
00:56:04,624 --> 00:56:08,224
What did you do to Freddy?
What's wrong with him and this man?

593
00:56:08,344 --> 00:56:11,983
- It's time you tell us what's going on.
- I don't have to tell you anything.

594
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:15,262
- We think you should.
- Tell 'em, goddamn it!

595
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:20,022
- Tell us!
- It was a chemical.

596
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:26,621
It soaked into the soil of the graveyard
and made the corpses come back to life.

597
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:30,420
- What fuckin' chemical?
- I don't know what chemical, goddamn it!

598
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,100
It was ordered by the military, I think.

599
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:35,699
How the fuck did it get
all over the graveyard?

600
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:38,019
I don't know. I just...

601
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:42,298
It was stored over at the medical
supply warehouse, where you were,

602
00:56:42,418 --> 00:56:45,258
and these two geniuses
opened the goddamn container

603
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:48,257
and let the son of a bitch out! Let him out!

604
00:56:48,377 --> 00:56:51,816
- Is that why Freddy's sick?
- I breathed it, Tina.

605
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:53,896
So did... so did Frank there.

606
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:59,255
- What did it do to you, Freddy?
- I'm freezin'.

607
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:03,295
- My muscles are stiffening up.
- Stiffening up?

608
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:08,574
- Stiffening up how, Freddy?
- First, I got a really fucked headache.

609
00:57:08,694 --> 00:57:12,773
Then my... my stomach
started cramping... cramping up.

610
00:57:12,893 --> 00:57:15,133
Now my arms and legs are cramping.

611
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:19,132
Let's take a look. Let's take a look.

612
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:21,412
Oh, God!

613
00:57:22,051 --> 00:57:24,411
Let's get his shirt up.

614
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:28,290
- What are you doing, Ernie?
- You'll see.

615
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,170
Uh... The bruises where he's lying down...

616
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,809
That's blood pooling up.

617
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:38,969
Easy, easy, easy!

618
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:49,287
You know, it... looks like
rigor mortis is setting in.

619
00:57:49,687 --> 00:57:52,846
Rigor mortis?
What do you mean, rigor mortis?

620
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:54,966
Hey, God...

621
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:59,445
You're dead, and you're gonna turn
into one of those things out there.

622
00:57:59,565 --> 00:58:02,165
No! No!

623
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,524
- Let him go!
- Let go!

624
00:58:06,284 --> 00:58:08,644
Shush. Just sh!

625
00:58:09,484 --> 00:58:11,803
You hear that?

626
00:58:14,803 --> 00:58:17,962
- What is that?
- It's another paramedic ambulance.

627
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,920
- Watch out!
- Hey! Don't go over there!

628
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,919
Goddamn!

629
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:40,118
They're gonna kill everybody that comes.

630
00:58:59,755 --> 00:59:02,395
Watch out! I'm gonna
get this board back up.

631
00:59:06,514 --> 00:59:08,474
It's got me!

632
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:29,430
Pull her off! Pull her off!

633
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,910
Christ!

634
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,589
Damn, he's dead! Shit! Shit!

635
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:39,629
What do we do with this thing?
What do we do with this?

636
00:59:39,749 --> 00:59:43,908
- Just wait here a second.
- Let's get outta here.

637
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:46,787
- Ernie, what are you doing?
- Ernie!

638
00:59:46,907 --> 00:59:47,867
Hey!

639
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:52,666
Let me take it! Let me take it!
You can let go of it now.

640
00:59:52,786 --> 00:59:54,866
Are you crazy?

641
00:59:54,986 --> 00:59:58,745
Look at it. It feels better now. Better.

642
01:00:00,065 --> 01:00:02,025
Gotta get outta here, Ernie.

643
01:00:02,785 --> 01:00:06,184
Ernie, we got to
get the fuck outta here. Leave it.

644
01:00:07,064 --> 01:00:09,904
What are you doing? Goddamn it, Ernie!

645
01:00:11,383 --> 01:00:14,543
I don't understand
what you want with it, Ernie.

646
01:00:14,663 --> 01:00:17,702
- I wanna examine it.
- You make sure it's tied right.

647
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:21,022
- It'll be tied right.
- It's not gonna get loose, right?

648
01:00:21,142 --> 01:00:25,181
No, it's not gonna get loose.
They're no stronger than humans.

649
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:34,739
- Don't be afraid.
- I'll bust it in the damn head.

650
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:37,459
Are you sure that thing's tied good?

651
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:40,858
- You can hear me?
- Yes.

652
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:49,537
- Why do you eat people?
- Not people. Brains.

653
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:53,376
- Brains only?
- Yes.

654
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:57,576
- Why?
- The pain.

655
01:00:57,896 --> 01:01:02,375
- What about the pain?
- The pain of being dead.

656
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:10,494
It hurts to be dead.

657
01:01:10,614 --> 01:01:14,573
I can feel myself rot.

658
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:20,532
Eating brains,
how does that make you feel?

659
01:01:21,292 --> 01:01:25,771
It makes the pain go away.

660
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,450
Hey, look, man. Fuck this.

661
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,729
I gotta talk to you... now.

662
01:01:37,689 --> 01:01:39,849
Come on, we gotta talk.

663
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:44,168
Let's talk out in the hallway.

664
01:01:49,327 --> 01:01:52,527
Man, look, how can we kill those things?

665
01:01:53,246 --> 01:01:56,606
- You don't.
- What the fuck do you mean, you don't?

666
01:01:56,726 --> 01:02:00,925
You can't kill them, they're already dead.
They're not living, they're animated.

667
01:02:01,045 --> 01:02:04,405
You can chop them into pieces,
the pieces will still come after you.

668
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:07,244
All you can do is just burn 'em,
reduce 'em to ashes,

669
01:02:07,364 --> 01:02:09,604
so there's nothing left to come after you.

670
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:13,163
- How you gonna burn all those?
- There's a hundred of those fuckers.

671
01:02:13,283 --> 01:02:16,283
Yeah, that... is the question.

672
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:15,593
We have a 10-32 from EMS.

673
01:03:15,713 --> 01:03:19,152
Two paramedic vehicles missing
in the East Piedmont district.

674
01:03:19,272 --> 01:03:20,952
Request a 10-51 code 3.

675
01:03:21,072 --> 01:03:24,711
Available units near the 20,000 block
of East Central, please respond.

676
01:03:25,151 --> 01:03:27,311
You think they'll rescue us?

677
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:31,030
Oh, they better, man. That's all I gotta say.

678
01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:38,069
But do you think they will?

679
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:50,627
Chuck... I never did like you.

680
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:54,586
Oh, my God, hold me tight.

681
01:03:56,386 --> 01:04:00,305
It would be wiser if we contained Frank
and Freddy. You know what I'm saying?

682
01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:03,945
- No. What do you mean, contained?
- Well, lock 'em in a room somewhere,

683
01:04:04,065 --> 01:04:07,424
so if they started acting funny,
they wouldn't hurt anybody.

684
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:09,824
You bastard! Why don't you
lock yourselves up?

685
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:12,703
Lady, we're not proposing
doing anything to them.

686
01:04:12,823 --> 01:04:16,583
We just wanna lock 'em in another room,
so we can work out how to get outta here.

687
01:04:16,703 --> 01:04:18,942
Tina, that really is a good idea.

688
01:04:19,062 --> 01:04:22,622
- Where can we put 'em, Ernie?
- Uh... well, uh... the chapel.

689
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:25,101
All right, help me with Frank, please.

690
01:04:44,738 --> 01:04:47,018
Right, lay them on the carpet gently.

691
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:53,057
Easy with him. Easy, Frank.
It's all right. Can you hear me, Frank?

692
01:04:53,177 --> 01:04:55,136
Oh, boy. He's gone.

693
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:58,216
- Oh, Tina.
- Oh, Freddy.

694
01:04:59,616 --> 01:05:03,575
- Look, let's just leave 'em and get out.
- I'm not leaving Freddy.

695
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:05,975
We gotta lock the door, you know that?

696
01:05:06,654 --> 01:05:08,614
I'm staying.

697
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:12,613
OK. Come on. Come on, Ernie.

698
01:05:21,892 --> 01:05:26,811
Dispatch, Dispatch, this is Bravo 751.
We're at the mortuary.

699
01:05:26,931 --> 01:05:31,610
We see two, that is two, paramedic
vehicles parked in the rear parking lot.

700
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:34,130
The doors on one vehicle
are hanging open.

701
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,729
Stand by while we investigate. Over.

702
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:02,045
I got a man down.

703
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:07,924
Oh, Jesus!

704
01:06:10,644 --> 01:06:14,363
- Hold it right there!
- Freeze or I'll blow your brains out!

705
01:06:18,962 --> 01:06:21,242
This place.

706
01:06:21,362 --> 01:06:24,841
Everybody that comes in
gets swallowed up.

707
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:27,841
Send more cops.

708
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:31,960
What are we gonna do? Stand around
until the corpses bust in this damn place?

709
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,240
- We gotta get the fuck out.
- We gotta get to the cars.

710
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,479
- There's corpses all over them.
- I know.

711
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,639
- What are you proposing?
- Me? We all should do some proposing.

712
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:45,718
The crawlspace in the ceiling.
We could barricade ourselves in.

713
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:48,478
The only way in is the hatch
and we could nail that shut.

714
01:06:48,598 --> 01:06:51,957
You must be out of your fuckin' mind.
I'm not going up in no roof.

715
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:54,037
I'd rather take my chances with the cars.

716
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:56,796
- We need a way to fight 'em.
- How about this?

717
01:06:57,996 --> 01:07:01,675
- What is that?
- It's nitric acid. Destroy anything.

718
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:04,355
Yeah, but there's not enough of it, Ernie.

719
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,033
It hurts more than you can imagine.

720
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:25,671
Freddy!

721
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:39,269
I can finally see the one thing...

722
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,748
the one thing that can relieve
this horrible suffering.

723
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:45,628
What, Freddy?

724
01:07:45,748 --> 01:07:48,228
Live brains!

725
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:23,022
Let's go.

726
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,940
Bring the girl!

727
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,300
Run! Run, Ernie!

728
01:08:41,419 --> 01:08:46,618
They got Freddy, man.
He was old and ugly, man.

729
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:49,777
His face was all fucked up, man.

730
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:53,617
That's not Freddy.

731
01:08:53,737 --> 01:08:55,936
Brains! Brains! Brains!

732
01:08:56,056 --> 01:08:57,336
Brains!

733
01:08:57,456 --> 01:08:59,936
Make her shut up! Make her shut up!

734
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:14,253
Shit! He's tryin' to get out.

735
01:09:14,493 --> 01:09:16,653
Get the bench. Come on.

736
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,692
Ernie! Ernie, out of the way!

737
01:09:25,372 --> 01:09:28,011
- Agh!
- Wedge it against it. It's all right.

738
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:32,850
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

739
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:37,730
- We can't stay here no more, man.
- We gotta run for the cars.

740
01:09:38,769 --> 01:09:43,369
- There's zombies all over the cars.
- Gotta fight our way through 'em.

741
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:46,608
Once we're in the car and moving,
I think we'll be all right.

742
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:49,328
It's a big fucking "if", man.

743
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:52,687
I can't walk, much less run.

744
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:55,207
How bad is your foot, Ernie?

745
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,846
Broke.

746
01:10:07,085 --> 01:10:09,404
Spider and I bring
one of the cars up to the door...

747
01:10:09,524 --> 01:10:13,284
Police car. It should still
have the keys in the ignition.

748
01:10:13,404 --> 01:10:16,083
- The motor's still running.
- Good. I'll drive.

749
01:10:16,203 --> 01:10:18,763
- No, I'll drive.
- Hey, fuck you.

750
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:21,962
When we drive up, I don't want to stay
longer than necessary.

751
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:26,641
Young lady, you stand right here. When
I say "now", you open that door fast.

752
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:29,481
When we're through,
you slam it hard and lock it.

753
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:32,440
Ernie, get your ass over here at the door.

754
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,519
Burt...

755
01:10:41,639 --> 01:10:43,599
That favor that you owe me...

756
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:45,918
Watch your ass out there.

757
01:10:49,238 --> 01:10:51,197
All right. Stand by.

758
01:10:54,477 --> 01:10:56,437
Now!

759
01:11:21,272 --> 01:11:23,312
You gotta get closer, man.

760
01:11:23,432 --> 01:11:26,352
- We gotta split.
- No, we can't split!

761
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:36,390
They left us! Those jerks! They left us!

762
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:38,470
They had to.

763
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:42,429
Burt'll send help. I know him.

764
01:11:43,229 --> 01:11:45,188
They left us.

765
01:11:46,108 --> 01:11:47,548
We can't just leave 'em!

766
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:50,188
They'd have turned the car over.
We'll send help.

767
01:11:50,308 --> 01:11:54,147
- Those are my fuckin' friends back there.
- I said we'll send help, man.

768
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:56,227
- Coward!
- Fuck you!

769
01:11:58,706 --> 01:12:00,506
Hang on, here we go!

770
01:12:01,746 --> 01:12:05,065
- What the fuck are we gonna do now?
- Find a phone, call the cops.

771
01:12:05,185 --> 01:12:08,025
- What the fuck!
- Jesus H Christ!

772
01:12:09,384 --> 01:12:11,344
Oh, shit!

773
01:12:15,263 --> 01:12:17,343
Back to the warehouse!

774
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:21,502
All right!

775
01:12:26,902 --> 01:12:29,661
- This way, you stupid honky!
- That's Spider.

776
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,740
Hey, bud.

777
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:36,020
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

778
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,300
- Who's he?
- He owns this place.

779
01:12:39,139 --> 01:12:43,899
- That fuckin' car is totaled, man.
- My car is still out there. So is Frank's.

780
01:12:46,058 --> 01:12:47,058
Not any more.

781
01:13:16,973 --> 01:13:18,413
Tina!

782
01:13:19,973 --> 01:13:24,452
Tina! Tina, where are you?

783
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:43,369
Forgive me.

784
01:14:25,202 --> 01:14:27,162
Brains!

785
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:33,920
Air 3. We got a bad situation here.
We've got officers down.

786
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,240
We have just witnessed
ground units attacked.

787
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,199
<i>- Helicopter!
- Attention, attention. This is the police.</i>

788
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:44,759
<i>This area is under police blockade.</i>

789
01:14:44,879 --> 01:14:47,438
<i>All persons within this area
wishing to surrender</i>

790
01:14:47,558 --> 01:14:50,798
<i>should make their way
to the perimeter at once.</i>

791
01:14:50,918 --> 01:14:54,957
Jesus! It sounds like the shit's
really hittin' the fan out there.

792
01:14:55,077 --> 01:14:57,917
- We gotta tell 'em we're here.
- You better believe it.

793
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:01,796
Hey, mister! Mister, don't go in there.

794
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:05,475
See, there's a thing in there.
It ripped out the phone.

795
01:15:05,595 --> 01:15:09,075
- There's another phone in the basement.
- The basement's fucked!

796
01:15:09,195 --> 01:15:11,394
- What do you mean?
- One of those corpses, man.

797
01:15:11,514 --> 01:15:13,714
A real ugly one, all black and slimy.

798
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:17,393
I don't give a shit what's in the basement.
We gotta get to that phone.

799
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,473
Blinding 'em seems to work OK.

800
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:22,632
Oh, shit. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

801
01:15:24,832 --> 01:15:27,112
Spider, open the door.

802
01:15:27,232 --> 01:15:29,471
I'm gonna knock his goddamn block off.

803
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,351
Tina, it was wrong
for you to lock me up.

804
01:15:32,471 --> 01:15:35,270
I had to hurt myself to get out.

805
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:37,790
But I forgive you, darling.

806
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:43,509
And I know you're here,
because I can smell your brains.

807
01:15:43,629 --> 01:15:47,228
- Please go away!
- I'm coming up, Tina.

808
01:15:59,746 --> 01:16:03,306
See? And now you made me
hurt myself again.

809
01:16:03,746 --> 01:16:07,225
You made me break my hand
completely off this time, Tina.

810
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:13,064
But I don't care, darling,
because I love you.

811
01:16:13,624 --> 01:16:19,463
And you've got to let me eat your brains!

812
01:16:29,181 --> 01:16:31,461
Open the door. Open the goddamn door.

813
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,860
Brains!

814
01:16:44,019 --> 01:16:46,898
All right, you guys, go. Get in there fast.

815
01:16:52,018 --> 01:16:53,977
Watch it! The step's out.

816
01:17:00,936 --> 01:17:02,896
Jesus Christ!

817
01:17:05,335 --> 01:17:07,695
That's our friend that the Tarman got.

818
01:17:15,974 --> 01:17:19,653
Give me the police.
It's an emergency, operator!

819
01:17:20,613 --> 01:17:22,573
Captain, over here.

820
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:27,852
Go ahead.

821
01:17:27,972 --> 01:17:31,891
You gotta help us. We're trapped inside
your barricade and we can't get out.

822
01:17:32,011 --> 01:17:34,491
First of all, mister,
what the hell is goin' on?

823
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:37,450
I lost a dozen good men and
nobody can tell me jack shit.

824
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:42,049
People in the cemetery are stark staring
mad, and they'll eat you if they catch you.

825
01:17:42,169 --> 01:17:44,569
It's like a disease. Like rabies, only faster.

826
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:48,648
That's why you gotta get us
the hell out of here right now. Please!

827
01:17:48,768 --> 01:17:51,368
I can't hear you.
There's a lot of noise out here.

828
01:17:51,488 --> 01:17:53,927
Hey, what the hell's going on?

829
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,207
Halt! I said halt!

830
01:17:56,327 --> 01:17:58,287
Watch it! They're crazy!

831
01:18:14,884 --> 01:18:16,844
- What?
- What is it?

832
01:18:20,323 --> 01:18:22,283
They've got the cops.

833
01:18:22,403 --> 01:18:26,402
That means they're breaking
out of the barricade. Jesus Christ!

834
01:18:32,601 --> 01:18:34,561
What's he doin'?

835
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,720
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

836
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:45,879
<i>Hello.</i>

837
01:18:45,999 --> 01:18:48,558
I'm calling the number
on the side of the tank.

838
01:18:48,678 --> 01:18:51,278
<i>- Your name, please?
- Burt Wilson.</i>

839
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:53,477
<i>Stay on the line. You're being transferred.</i>

840
01:18:54,957 --> 01:18:56,557
<i>This is Comm-Q, Denver.</i>

841
01:18:56,677 --> 01:19:00,636
<i>Denver, this is Wichita. I've got
a CLY priority on a 113. Who's up?</i>

842
01:19:00,756 --> 01:19:03,596
<i>That's Colonel Glover, San Diego.
I'll put you through.</i>

843
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,715
Yes.

844
01:19:09,355 --> 01:19:11,315
Yes, Captain.

845
01:19:12,034 --> 01:19:14,434
- I see. Very well.
- Horace...

846
01:19:14,554 --> 01:19:16,514
Put the call through to me.

847
01:19:17,194 --> 01:19:19,153
Yes. Put him on.

848
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:23,393
Mr. Wilson? Where are you calling from?

849
01:19:25,272 --> 01:19:27,592
I see. And when did this take place?

850
01:19:28,752 --> 01:19:31,031
And when was the tank first breached?

851
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:34,871
Why didn't you call
this number immediately?

852
01:19:35,431 --> 01:19:38,430
I see. It's understandable.
What happened next?

853
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,390
Uh-huh.

854
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,069
Oh, you did?
And what effect did that have?

855
01:19:45,629 --> 01:19:47,389
I see.

856
01:19:48,108 --> 01:19:50,068
So what did you do then?

857
01:19:52,068 --> 01:19:54,027
And what did they do?

858
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:56,747
I see.

859
01:19:57,907 --> 01:19:59,667
Oh, really?

860
01:19:59,786 --> 01:20:01,746
How many did you say?

861
01:20:02,786 --> 01:20:05,786
And how many acres does
this cemetery cover, sir?

862
01:20:06,705 --> 01:20:08,665
Yes.

863
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:11,145
I see. I see.

864
01:20:11,665 --> 01:20:13,624
Yes, I see. Of course.

865
01:20:13,744 --> 01:20:15,824
Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Wilson.

866
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,543
I'm going to switch you back
to Captain Turner now.

867
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:50,178
Sir, this is Colonel Glover.

868
01:20:50,298 --> 01:20:54,177
I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour, sir,
but we're at Q-2 status.

869
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:57,337
It looks like we've found
that consignment of Easter eggs.

870
01:21:00,216 --> 01:21:03,736
Yes, sir. Pretty sure.
They've turned up in Louisville.

871
01:21:03,856 --> 01:21:08,135
I'm getting confirmations on this
from the Louisville Police Department.

872
01:21:08,255 --> 01:21:10,215
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

873
01:21:11,775 --> 01:21:15,854
Well, sir, it would be good news,
except that the eggs have hatched.

874
01:21:16,134 --> 01:21:19,373
- What are they doin', man?
- Hang on a second, would ya?

875
01:21:19,493 --> 01:21:22,893
It's weird. These people say
they've been waiting for this.

876
01:21:23,013 --> 01:21:26,212
Apparently they've got
some sort of contingency plan.

877
01:21:26,332 --> 01:21:29,092
- Well, that's great.
- What is this plan?

878
01:21:31,091 --> 01:21:34,491
Sergeant Jefferson,
42nd Special Mobile Artillery.

879
01:21:34,611 --> 01:21:36,730
Yes, sir. Good morning to you too, sir.

880
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:42,809
Yes, sir. All right, sir. Whatever you say,
sir. The code numbers, please, sir.

881
01:21:42,929 --> 01:21:48,249
Archimedes. Hotdog. Rhubarb.
Niner. Zero. Niner. Gotcha, sir.

882
01:21:49,408 --> 01:21:51,368
<i>Bearing - mark 220.</i>

883
01:21:51,968 --> 01:21:53,928
Bearing - 220.

884
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:59,247
<i>Range - mark 134 miles.</i>

885
01:21:59,607 --> 01:22:02,486
Range - 134 miles.

886
01:22:16,924 --> 01:22:18,883
Hey, listen.

887
01:22:20,123 --> 01:22:21,443
You hear anything?

888
01:22:22,403 --> 01:22:24,363
Tina...

889
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,680
5.01 AM EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME

890
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:46,679
Spectacular result, sir.
Very close to optimal placements.

891
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:50,478
Well, sir, only 20
square blocks destroyed.

892
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,558
Less than 4,000 dead, General.

893
01:22:52,678 --> 01:22:57,557
I wouldn't worry about the fires, General.
The rain is taking care of that right now.

894
01:22:57,677 --> 01:23:01,356
There have been complaints about
burning skin, but I shouldn't worry.

895
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:05,076
A minor irritation, General.
The rain will wash everything away.

896
01:23:05,196 --> 01:23:08,555
That's correct, sir. All should
be back to normal by morning.

897
01:23:08,675 --> 01:23:12,115
Yes, sir. I understand the president
will visit Louisville tomorrow.

898
01:23:12,235 --> 01:23:14,994
No, we wouldn't want that to happen, sir.

899
01:23:15,114 --> 01:23:18,274
No, sir. This hasn't been
very pleasant for anyone.

900
01:23:18,914 --> 01:23:21,073
Thank you, sir. Good night, sir.

901
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:37,230
Brains.

902
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:41,470
Oh, we're gonna kill it! I'm gonna kill it!

903
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:45,469
- It's all over everything.
- Stupid asshole!

904
01:23:45,589 --> 01:23:48,869
- Watch your tongue if you like this job.
- Like this job?

905
01:23:50,308 --> 01:23:52,268
Burt? Frank.

906
01:23:52,548 --> 01:23:54,148
We have a little problem here.

907
01:23:57,627 --> 01:24:02,066
Do you ever fantasize...
about being killed?

908
01:24:06,026 --> 01:24:07,345
I hit the fucking brain.

909
01:24:07,705 --> 01:24:11,705
- How do you kill it if it's already dead?
- How do I know, Fred? Let me think.

910
01:24:11,825 --> 01:24:13,105
It's not a bad question, Burt.

911
01:24:13,225 --> 01:24:17,624
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life.

912
01:24:17,824 --> 01:24:20,663
- There's a hundred of those fuckers.
- A hundred?

913
01:24:20,783 --> 01:24:22,743
Brains.

914
01:24:24,703 --> 01:24:26,502
Send more cops.

915
01:24:26,622 --> 01:24:30,342
- Goddamn!
- I think things are gettin' out of hand.

916
01:24:31,861 --> 01:24:33,701
Get it off! Get it off!

917
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:38,700
- It worked in the movie.
- It ain't workin' now.

918
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,380
You mean the movie lied?

919
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,899
It's not a bad question, Burt.

920
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,139
