15
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,138
It's hot, isn't it?

16
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,057
Good day.

17
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,643
I can't cope in this heat.

18
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,481
What are they showing next
at the Aioi Theatre?

19
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,110
These Kabuki plays.

20
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,737
Lots of swordfights, eh?

21
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,159
I really liked that strip show
last month.

22
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,414
Remember that girl in pink panties
with the big arse?

23
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,083
The new shows aren't like that.

24
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,837
- It's grand Kabuki.
- Is that right?

25
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,716
This troupe is coming all the way

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,969
via Okazaki, Kariya
and Cape Chita.

27
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,929
Is that right?

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,974
You'll let me in for free, then, right?

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:10,314
I remember I saw this troupe
17, 18 years ago.

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,068
It was in Yamada town,
I saw this actor Komajuro.

31
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,239
- Really?
- He was really good as well.

32
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,700
He played the role
of Marubashi Chuya.

33
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,994
"A pint here and a quart there

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,331
"Quite a lot that I'm aware"

35
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,874
Is that so?

36
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,211
I wonder if the boat'll be late again.

37
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:37,466
Not that I've heard.
I think she'll be here on the dot.

38
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,135
That's once in a blue moon, right?

39
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,720
Indeed it is.

40
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,975
It's going to be hot today.

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,581
- Hey! Are we running late?
- No, we're almost there.

42
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,846
Master?

43
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,224
Dearest!

44
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,228
Almost there?

45
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,190
Kayo, you bring that, please.

46
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,194
It's fine.

47
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,238
Was this yours?

48
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,041
Don't leave anything behind.

49
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,252
- Are you ready, Roku?
- Aye.

50
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,254
- You too?
- Eh?

51
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,464
Don't forget anything!

52
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,011
Don't forget me, dear

53
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,764
Don't forget me

54
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:37,544
The Arashi Komajuro Troupe
Playing At The Aioi Theatre

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,351
Komajuro Arashi & His Troupe

56
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,113
- Give me one!
- Oi, give us one!

57
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:32,576
- Come on, you miser!
- What? You got any older sisters?

58
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,453
- No.
- I do!

59
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,246
Right, then...

60
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,082
- How old is she?
- Twelve.

61
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,625
Idiot!

62
00:07:46,632 --> 00:08:02,564
Afternoon.

63
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,733
Put this up, will you?

64
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,362
- At the Aioi Theatre, eh?
- Come and see us.

65
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,200
Hey, listen,
does it start from tonight?

66
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,661
Er... that's right.

67
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,497
I see...

68
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,346
Oh, hello there.

69
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,765
I'll be coming tonight.

70
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,518
Please do.
I'll be expecting you.

71
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,202
Your wife's here, sir!

72
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,043
- So... business is good, eh?
- Well...

73
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,837
Can I take a match?

74
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,052
Listen...

75
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,639
What's your name?

76
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,767
Kinnosuke.

77
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,519
Kinnosuke?

78
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,231
I'm Kin-chan.

79
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,732
Oh, no way?

80
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,277
No way!

81
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,078
- He wants another sake, Master.
- All right.

82
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,293
Afternoon.

83
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,920
I'll be expecting you tonight.

84
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,881
Let's go together, Okatsu.

85
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,052
And who'll take care
of the customers, eh?

86
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,264
Please come. I'll be waiting.

87
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,562
Goodbye.

88
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,694
I'll be seeing you.

89
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,161
He's generous, that one.

90
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,963
So that actor's from Osaka, is he?

91
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,924
He's an old-timer
around these parts.

92
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,803
He once played in our town, as well.

93
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,767
They say he used to play
at the big Kado Theatre in Osaka.

94
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,519
Is that so? That means that...

95
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,022
Don't move or you'll get cut.

96
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,068
Oh, my.
Please don't cut me, Aiko.

97
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,280
Good day!

98
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,661
- Please take these.
- Thank you.

99
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,579
Hot, isn't it?

100
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,498
Awfully hot.

101
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,337
Is that your daughter?
Very pretty.

102
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,298
Good day.
Are you helping your dad out?

103
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,135
Good girl. Most admirable.

104
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,723
You can rest assured, eh?

105
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,650
"Ogawa Aiko"?
That's a pretty name.

106
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,695
So, Aiko-chan,
are you the only child?

107
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,700
The apple of his eye, eh?
And a great help to your dad.

108
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,536
Will you marry her off to a barber?
Listen, Aiko...

109
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,872
Marry a good-looking fellow,
a man like me.

110
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,332
Good and kind-hearted.

111
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,130
You're such a pretty little thing.

112
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,340
Really, you are!

113
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,420
Shokichi, make me a cup of tea.

114
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,106
- We're back.
- You must be tired.

115
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,951
We're back.

116
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,413
- Well done.
- You must be exhausted.

117
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,628
It's so hot.

118
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,674
Hey... bring me my kimono over,
would you?

119
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,138
- Where are you off to?
- I have to visit a patron.

120
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,192
- Welcome.
- Oh, welcome, sir.

121
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,486
Please come in.

122
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,573
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much indeed.

123
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,408
Come through, sir.

124
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,171
The impresario's here, Master.

125
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,714
Please come up.

126
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,094
Thanks for earlier, sir.
Please sit down.

127
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,762
Please.

128
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,516
It's been such a long time.

129
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,228
It's been a while indeed.

130
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,065
Yes. It's wonderful
to be back here again.

131
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,568
When was the last time?

132
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,238
Wasn't it during those hard times
just after the war ended?

133
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,951
It was. It's already
twelve years since then.

134
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,495
That many years?

135
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,831
Well, time flies.

136
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,959
I see several new faces.

137
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,046
Well, with the changing times,
you know.

138
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,592
This is Sumiko, sir.

139
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,888
Very pleased to meet you.

140
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:56,060
What happened to that fellow
who played "Yasu The Bat"?

141
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,229
Oh, you mean Tatsunosuke?

142
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,899
He died at Fukuchiyama.

143
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,610
Is that so? What happened?

144
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,320
He had a stroke.

145
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,741
Such a good actor, too.
I'm sorry to hear that.

146
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,329
And this is Tatsunosuke's daughter.

147
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,169
You've grown up
into a fine young woman.

148
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,589
She used to be just like
a Chinese nut.

149
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,553
What's a Chinese nut?

150
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,555
It's a peanut!

151
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,437
How can we help you, Kimura?

152
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,193
I'll be off now, Master.
Is there anything else...?

153
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,987
I'll let you know.

154
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,448
Flat rate, as you said?

155
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,325
That'll be fine.

156
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,954
- Where's your next stop?
- Shingu in Kii Province.

157
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,455
Oh, I see.

158
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,250
I'll be off, then.

159
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,968
Master, the impresario
has brought us a gift.

160
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,844
Thank you, sir.

161
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,055
- Many thanks, sir.
- Thank you.

162
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,432
Let's join together and give thanks.

163
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:22,105
Let's give thanks...
And twice!

164
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,691
And thrice!

165
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,486
Congratulations!

166
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:06,315
- Is that the actor that's just arrived?
- Looks a bit old for it.

167
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,873
Excuse me?

168
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,962
Welcome.

169
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,631
Could I have a flask of sake?

170
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,261
- I'll leave the money here.
- Thank you.

171
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,644
I've been expecting you.
I saw the parade.

172
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,773
It's been a while.
You haven't changed a bit.

173
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,777
Come inside.
It's much cooler in here.

174
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,071
Really? Thanks, I'll come in.

175
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,332
- There you go.
- Thanks.

176
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,334
I'm glad to see you look well.

177
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,461
- You too.
- Thank you.

178
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,296
It's been twelve years.

179
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,804
So many years,
it must've been hard by yourself.

180
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,934
You had a frozen shoulder
the last time we met.

181
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,811
Are you all right now?

182
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,563
Did I, indeed?

183
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,901
You kept telling me
the pain was killing you.

184
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,196
Is that so? Well, it's fine now.

185
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,282
There's a nice breeze here.

186
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,259
- Sorry to be a bother.
- Not at all.

187
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,636
Thank you so much.

188
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,640
How's Kiyoshi? Is he well?

189
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,352
He finished school
the year before last.

190
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,396
So you said in your letter.

191
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,191
Oh, did I? He's working now.

192
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,819
- Where?
- The post office.

193
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,696
It's only part-time.

194
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,657
He's keen to study electronics
at college.

195
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,367
Good for him.

196
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,287
But then I'll be all on my own here.

197
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,789
That's not good for you.

198
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,543
- But he's saving money for college.
- Is he?

199
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,962
I don't want to discourage him.

200
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,422
You're right.

201
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,432
Tell me...

202
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,936
Does Kiyoshi...
know anything about me?

203
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,111
Does he think his father's dead?

204
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,823
And that I'm only your brother?

205
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,394
Your flowers are doing well.

206
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,233
Don't you ever feel lonely?

207
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,195
- About what?
- About Kiyoshi.

208
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,572
Can't be helped.

209
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,909
He deserves someone better
than the likes of me.

210
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,579
Yes, but...

211
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,292
- Let's not talk about it.
- I know, but...

212
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,587
Leave it.
And let it remain that way.

213
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,556
I feel sorry for you, though.
Anyway...

214
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,311
- Have a drink.
- Thank you.

215
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,233
What can be done?

216
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,952
Oh, that's Kiyoshi.

217
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,581
Welcome home.

218
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,294
Oh, you're here, Uncle.

219
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,923
I'd have come home sooner.

220
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,305
- Are you working?
- I was studying with the postmaster.

221
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,265
Look how you've grown!

222
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,684
He'd have been of conscription age.

223
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,603
Really?
A first-class soldier, no doubt!

224
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,611
He's grown up so much.

225
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,948
No hope for us oldies, eh?

226
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,043
It's been years since we last met.

227
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,339
How long are you staying, Uncle?

228
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,550
As long as we draw an audience.
Six months, a year, maybe.

229
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,095
- It won't run that long.
- It will!

230
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,351
Is this your work?

231
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,021
- What's this?
- Don't touch it.

232
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,982
I'll come to the show tonight.
What part do you play?

233
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,486
Don't come.
It's not your kind of show.

234
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,529
Whose kind of show is it?

235
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,242
- Well, the audience's.
- Aren't I one of them?

236
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,413
I know that, but it's nothing
very sophisticated. Forget about it.

237
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,584
So why do you put on such plays?
Why not show something better?

238
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,462
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

239
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:05,383
Today's audiences don't
understand quality plays.

240
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,593
So don't bother coming.

241
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,432
The last time,
we went fishing together.

242
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,435
- What fish do you catch now?
- Well...

243
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,313
- It doesn't matter. Let's go again.
- In this heat?

244
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,233
I don't mind the heat.
Let's go, shall we?

245
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,444
- How about tomorrow, Sunday?
- Shall we?

246
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,946
Yes, let's go.

247
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,825
We're definitely going?

248
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,707
He's really grown up.

249
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,422
- Has the sake chilled?
- No, it's fine.

250
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,388
He's certainly good
at arguing his point of view.

251
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,225
What did you argue about?

252
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,644
He's wise for his years.

253
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,062
Clever lad.

254
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,000
Welcome, all!

255
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,761
Welcome, two good patrons!

256
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,392
Welcome!

257
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,648
- Tetsu!
- Aye?

258
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,986
- Sadahachi?
- What is it, Boss?

259
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,366
This is our last night
on Mount Akagi

260
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,206
I'm leaving my home village
of Kunisada

261
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,167
And leaving my territory

262
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:08,839
I must take my leave of you, too,
my loyal vassals

263
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:15,304
This is my final farewell
to the Kunisada clan

264
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:21,519
Hearing you speak so,
I am filled with chagrin

265
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:29,235
The geese call out
as they cross the southern skies

266
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:36,575
The moon is slipping
behind the western hills

267
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,496
Where shall I venture now?

268
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:44,166
Wherever my legs carry me

269
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:49,922
I will roam aimlessly
to the end of the world

270
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,341
Boss!

271
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,596
Is that not Brother Enzo?

272
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,267
Stout-hearted as he is...

273
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:08,065
...he must feel lonesome
leaving his home village

274
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,756
O, illustrious blade

275
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,597
Thoroughly tempered by
the famous Yoshikane of Kaga

276
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:46,979
Purified in the rivers
of the perpetual snows

277
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,613
You, at least, will protect me

278
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:02,202
You will be at my side,
faithful one!

279
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,093
The geese fly away

280
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,642
The crows too lament for me

281
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,865
Well done.

282
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,672
Take a look at that one.

283
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,509
- The barber's daughter.
- Which one?

284
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,596
You see the old dame
with a towel on her head?

285
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,683
Behind her.
She's eating a bun now.

286
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,988
What a big mouth she has.

287
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,700
Which one is your find?
Is she here?

288
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,787
She's out there. It's that one.

289
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,581
The one smoking,
in the white kimono.

290
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,549
She's lovely looking.

291
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,885
A real find, too.
Which one's mine?

292
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,930
Yours hasn't come.

293
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,767
She's even prettier, mind.
Not my taste, though.

294
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,562
Really? I can't wait.

295
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,738
That's naughty, stop it.

296
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,208
It went down well?
How were the takings?

297
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,297
Three-quarters full,
not bad for an opening.

298
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,927
It'll fill up, you'll see.

299
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,306
- I hope so.
- It'll be fine.

300
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,892
It was the same
for the shows in Kariya.

301
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,478
Why are you so pessimistic
these days?

302
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,981
- I'm not at all.
- Don't you worry.

303
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,816
Mark my words.

304
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,486
It'll pick up, I'm sure.

305
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,979
Where do you go
after that scene in Kunisada?

306
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,191
I climb down Mount Akagi.

307
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,860
After that, I mean.

308
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,864
Don't you see?
I head straight for you, don't I?

309
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,033
Oh, you are awful.

310
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,286
I'm not awful at all.

311
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,206
Ah, here he comes.

312
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,294
Welcome.

313
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,421
- Hello.
- Over here.

314
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,430
It's so hot.
Sweat's pouring off me.

315
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,892
So where's my girl?

316
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,436
Don't worry, she's coming.

317
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,024
- Where's the Master?
- He's gone out.

318
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,402
Let's have a drink.

319
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,823
Hurry up, Yae,
your man's waiting.

320
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,585
Oh, welcome. Good day to you!

321
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,382
- This one?
- She's your type.

322
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,467
You've got to be joking.

323
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,555
- No good?
- Stop taking the mickey.

324
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,058
What are you talking about?
Look at me.

325
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,563
- A chill’s running down my spine.
- Have a drink, then.

326
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:46,278
Kichi, you're a black-hearted fellow.
I misjudged you.

327
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,614
- How's that?
- Don't give me that!

328
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,157
Here...

329
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,619
Look at me, I'm depressed now.

330
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,246
- Why's that?
- Please don't ask.

331
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,333
- My mother's just passed away.
- Really?

332
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,461
It's no good, I'm catching a chill.

333
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,714
- Let her warm you up, then!
- Welcome.

334
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,466
All’s well?

335
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,052
Are you coming in?

336
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,265
- What's your name, darling?
- Katsuko.

337
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,225
What a pretty name.

338
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,896
What a find, Senta!
Have a good time.

339
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,981
I'm just off out.

340
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,317
- So long.
- So long.

341
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,944
Do come again!

342
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,074
Hey, Senta...

343
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,910
What's got into you, Sentaro?

344
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:41,124
"Though all the world betrays me..."

345
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,251
Oh, just give me some sake. Hurry!

346
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,338
Oh, this fella could lead me astray!

347
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,508
Bring on the sake, Master!

348
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,926
Right-o.

349
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,688
- Afternoon.
- Welcome.

350
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,732
- Where's your dad today?
- Out at a meeting.

351
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,318
I see. Hot, isn't it?

352
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,701
- Did you come to see my dad?
- I couldn't care less about your dad.

353
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,078
It's you I came to see.

354
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,872
Disgusting!

355
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:27,045
I'm being serious, Aiko.
Just feel how my heart's beating.

356
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,173
- Go on.
- Mama! Mama!

357
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,760
What is it?

358
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,102
What's going on?
What do you want?

359
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,105
Well... I was wondering
if I could get a shave.

360
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,065
Aiko, go inside.

361
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,824
If you please...

362
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,786
There's not that much growth...

363
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,123
Maybe I can do without a shave.

364
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,292
Maybe I won't.

365
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,920
- Sit down.
- Yes, thank you.

366
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,508
They're not biting, Uncle.

367
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,929
Be patient, they'll start biting.

368
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,684
Isn't your head getting hot?
Here, put this on.

369
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,603
I'm fine.

370
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,816
- I think you overdid it a bit.
- What do you mean?

371
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,777
Your performance,
it was a bit hammy.

372
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,695
Don't talk nonsense!

373
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,614
It was all right.

374
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,788
But that character Marubashi
is totally unrealistic.

375
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,458
Unrealistic?

376
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,502
He doesn't relate to today's world.

377
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,462
You're talking rubbish!

378
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,924
Marubashi is a character
from another era.

379
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,178
You just don't understand.
It's old fashioned.

380
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,016
You think you know it all.

381
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:52,357
The audience likes my performance
whether it's hammy or old fashioned.

382
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,861
So as long as the audience is happy,
it's all right?

383
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,989
Give it a rest,
talking about the theatre.

384
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,994
Look at that,
I've lost my bait again.

385
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,378
I hear you want to go to college?

386
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,925
I'm in favour of you studying...

387
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,304
...but your poor mother will be lonely.

388
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,181
Doesn't matter.

389
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,767
It certainly does.
Imagine how she'd feel.

390
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,561
She's a good mother to you.

391
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,983
But she approves of me studying,
so it's all right.

392
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,319
It's not all right.

393
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,655
Don't upset her.
She's a good mother.

394
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,400
Don't be so clumsy!

395
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,336
Was the bath hot enough, Miss?

396
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,090
Absolutely perfect. I'm done now.

397
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,601
There's no cold water, though.

398
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,736
That was a lovely bath.

399
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,782
- The Master's not back yet?
- No.

400
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,787
Where did he go?

401
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,001
- He went fishing, didn't he?
- Fishing?

402
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,963
I was having a shave
at the barber's.

403
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,841
I saw him pass by
with a young man.

404
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,969
- A young man?
- Don't you know him?

405
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,389
He's a post office clerk,
I saw him in the mirror.

406
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,932
Really?

407
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,310
- What happened to you here?
- Well...

408
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,980
- I got cut at the barber's.
- I see...

409
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,650
Kayo, go ahead and have a bath.

410
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,320
All right, then.

411
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,668
Supper's ready, you lot. Supper!

412
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,505
Get up, Grandpa, it's supper!

413
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,638
Let's carry on later.

414
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,313
Supper time.

415
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,482
Were you out with her?

416
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,694
- Welcome home.
- Evening.

417
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,241
Welcome home.

418
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,035
Where have you been?

419
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,079
I was out with the boys.

420
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,708
- Good catch?
- What?

421
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,251
Fish, of course!

422
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,298
Did you catch anything, Kichi?

423
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:52,639
He landed himself a puffer fish.
A great big fat thing, it was!

424
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,767
- Good catch, eh?
- It's no joke!

425
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,854
See you later.

426
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,735
- Were you really together?
- With whom?

427
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,613
- With the boys.
- Yeah.

428
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,492
- So where did you go?
- Just fishing.

429
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:17,122
Really? So who was the young man
you were with?

430
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,791
Oh, one of my patron's sons.

431
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,336
A post office clerk?

432
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,133
- Who told you that?
- Never mind who told me.

433
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,634
Very well.

434
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,222
- Who told you?
- You seem bothered by it.

435
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:39,936
- Why are you acting strange?
- Why?

436
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,856
- Are you feeling guilty?
- About what?

437
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,401
Ah, I see. You're jealous!

438
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,113
Stop it, you silly thing!

439
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:57,495
Why would I fool around
with other women when I've got you?

440
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,873
I'm not a spring chicken any more!

441
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,876
You know me. Don't you?

442
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,961
Don't sweet-talk me.

443
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,865
Hey, you must know something.

444
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,660
Why won't you tell me?

445
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,126
Listen, I won't say you told me.

446
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,589
I won't tell anyone.
What do you know?

447
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,883
Tell me.

448
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,597
Oi, Masa, be careful!

449
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,361
You've known the Master for years.

450
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,197
Right? You ought to know.

451
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,076
You came here with him
before my time.

452
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,871
So tell me.
I'm begging you. Please.

453
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,250
Can't be helped.

454
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,878
What can't be helped?

455
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,382
What is it?

456
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,261
What can't be helped?

457
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,889
He's bound to see...

458
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,059
...his old flame.

459
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,104
Is that so?

460
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,773
Just what I thought.

461
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:55,321
So, who is she?
Where is she?

462
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:02,745
What kind of person is she?
What's she like?

463
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,583
Better ask Rokusaburo.

464
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,087
He knows her as well? I see.

465
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,716
So Roku knows about her too?

466
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,746
How can you stand this, Master?

467
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,333
- Stand what?
- Such an empty house.

468
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,380
Why did we have to come here?

469
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,654
What is it, Roku?

470
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,573
She's out there.

471
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,658
I see.

472
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,046
- Which one?
- That one.

473
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:04,218
In front of that pillar
in the opposite corner, with the fan.

474
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,244
Thank you, Roku. I owe you.

475
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,804
What an insult!

476
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,388
What's up?

477
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,808
It's awful!

478
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,103
What are you grumbling on about?

479
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,274
You can't help an empty house
when it's empty.

480
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,740
Is that rain?

481
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,369
Hey, is it raining?

482
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,625
- It's started spitting.
- Oh, right.

483
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,253
Misfortunes never come alone.

484
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,673
Swift is heaven's vengeance!

485
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,927
What are you hinting at?
Don't start complaining.

486
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:32,139
I've had enough of it.
You're giving me a headache already.

487
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,102
Serves you right.
I knew this would happen.

488
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,398
Hey! Behave yourself!

489
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,539
- Hold on a minute.
- Again?

490
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,418
If I go there...
And then there...

491
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,631
There.

492
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,925
- Are you done?
- Fine. Go ahead.

493
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,514
- Checkmate.
- Eh? Hang on...

494
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,100
That's no good. Wait a second.

495
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,436
- No way.
- Wait, wait!

496
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,857
Let this old man get
his head straight...

497
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,819
If I avoid that, you'll come there...

498
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,321
No good.

499
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,241
If I go there... you go...

500
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,161
That's no good, either...

501
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,291
What are you on about? Hurry up!

502
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,544
Hang on! If I go there...

503
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,837
Hurry up!

504
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,967
Just... hold... your... horses!

505
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,802
There!

506
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,165
Good afternoon.

507
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,501
A flask of sake.

508
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,715
- Tell me, madam...
- Yes?

509
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,390
Is Master Komajuro
from my troupe here?

510
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,726
Yes, he is indeed.

511
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,061
Would you call him for me?

512
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,909
- Listen...
- What is it?

513
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,622
- A visitor for you.
- Who?

514
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,879
Wait for me.
I'll be back to defeat you.

515
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,049
- I don't mind letting you win a game.
- Fool!

516
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,722
I was going easy on you.

517
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,308
Don't mess with the board.

518
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,737
What do you want?

519
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,909
Why are you here?

520
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,456
- Am I not allowed here?
- What are you saying?

521
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:30,127
So your "important patron"
was the proprietress here?

522
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:42,098
- Where are you going?
- I must offer thanks to your "patron".

523
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,433
Wait! Stop!

524
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,519
What's the problem?

525
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:54,443
I must thank you for attending
to Komajuro's needs.

526
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,491
Don't play the innocent with me.

527
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,953
Go away!

528
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,623
- Get going!
- What are you doing?

529
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,752
Hey, you. Are you her son?

530
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,420
Hey, stop it.

531
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,677
Who's your father?
What does he do?

532
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,263
- What are you saying?
- Why are you so flustered?

533
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,850
What a fine son you have,
eh, madam?

534
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,894
- You're leaving.
- I have something to tell them!

535
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,188
Let go! Let go of me!

536
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,482
What are you saying, you fool? Leave!

537
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,359
Let me go! Let me go!

538
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,196
You're an idiot! A fool!

539
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,656
What were you thinking?
Behave yourself!

540
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,658
To hell with you!

541
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:29,205
How dare you interfere,
you meddling fool!

542
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,342
You have no say in their affairs!

543
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,970
What's wrong
with me seeing my son?

544
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,056
My own son!

545
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:51,393
What are your objections?
If you have any, say so, you fool!

546
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,522
Fine words coming from you!

547
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,858
What did you say, you bitch?

548
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,152
How dare you mouth off at me!

549
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:03,072
- You think I'll listen to you?
- I beg your pardon?

550
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:07,576
Have you forgotten about Okaya
and who got you out of that hole?

551
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,286
And at Toyokawa, too!

552
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,665
Each time you were in difficulties,
you begged me for help!

553
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,166
What?

554
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,752
Where would you be without me?

555
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:22,216
Each time I had to appeal
to the impresario on my knees!

556
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,635
- Just remember all that!
- What?

557
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,763
You impudent, ungrateful brute!

558
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,307
What? What did you say?

559
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:34,603
Who do you think you are?
Remember what you used to be!

560
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,814
You were a common
bathhouse whore!

561
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,234
You fell for me
and came begging to me.

562
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,737
Who trained you
as an actress? Who?

563
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,910
Ungrateful wretch.

564
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,830
You're lower than an animal.

565
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,707
You stupid bitch!

566
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:59,628
I can get along by myself
without any help from you!

567
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,715
I can get along just fine!

568
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,467
You make me laugh, you fool!

569
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:09,513
Who's the fool? It's you!
You're the fool here!

570
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,432
How dare you say that!

571
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,475
I'll say what I want!

572
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,146
Right, then,
I'm through with you.

573
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,482
I forbid you to come into this house!

574
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,239
My son's different from your type.

575
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:30,200
He belongs to a higher race!

576
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,203
Don't forget that, you fool!

577
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,499
What are you talking about,
you silly bitch!

578
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,048
Idiot.

579
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,341
Stupid bitch!

580
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,224
Respectful silence, please!

581
00:55:55,143 --> 00:56:00,397
Stop making such a racket,
warriors

582
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,524
Listen with compassion
to a parent's plea

583
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,736
To save my daughter's life

584
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,405
With consummate skill,
plot a clever scheme

585
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,784
To hide on the path
by the tile-topped wall

586
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:17,456
Then the shaven-headed Munetoshi,
owner of the Sukiya...

587
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,630
There's hardly any punters in.

588
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,759
Not much we can do about it.

589
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,803
We'll be stranded.

590
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,055
May the Lord Buddha help us!

591
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:49,446
Listen, Kayo,
I want you to do me a favour.

592
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,865
Like what?

593
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:56,412
There's a young local man
working at the post office.

594
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,374
A good-looking lad,
named Kiyoshi.

595
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,210
Oh, yes?
What about him?

596
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,795
Well...

597
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,303
- What's this for?
- Just take it.

598
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,310
- What's it for?
- Go and see this boy.

599
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,730
- I want you to seduce him.
- Seduce him?

600
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:28,235
He'll fall for you, I'm sure.
Do it for me.

601
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,321
I couldn't possibly do it.

602
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,700
I'm being serious, Kayo.

603
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,161
But I've never even met him.

604
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,456
Very well.

605
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,168
All right, if you won't even
do that for me...

606
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,795
- Yes, but...
- Just forget it.

607
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,346
I'm not sure
I'd even be able to do it.

608
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,892
You can.
That's why I asked you.

609
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:05,898
I have yet to find a man
who can resist your smile.

610
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,110
You really think I can do it?
I might fail.

611
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,904
You'll be fine.

612
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,866
But why are you doing this?

613
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,993
Just do it for me.

614
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,412
Let's see how good you are.

615
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,539
And keep the money.

616
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,587
Thanks a lot.

617
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,547
Tomorrow it is, then.

618
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,345
I'll give it a try, then.

619
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,359
POST OFFICE

620
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,262
A blank telegram, please.

621
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,605
- Can you lend me a pencil?
- There's a pen here.

622
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,733
I can't write with a pen.
Lend me a pencil.

623
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,451
I saw you on stage.

624
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,911
Oh, yes?

625
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,164
Your name's Kiyoshi, isn't it?

626
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,334
How do you know that?

627
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,962
A little bird told me.

628
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,007
Despatch this for me.

629
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,303
"Come outside to seek me"

630
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,972
No, it's: "Come outside to see me."

631
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,934
- Who's it to?
- You.

632
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,615
Cover for me a moment.

633
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,970
Come by the theatre
after the show tonight.

634
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,931
I'll be expecting you.

635
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,547
Ma, I'm just going out.

636
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:04,052
- What are you up to?
- I left something at the post office.

637
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,236
Oi, give me a bowl of noodles.

638
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,527
I'm glad you came.

639
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,279
I didn't think you would.

640
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,118
Are you shaking?

641
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,625
Me, too.

642
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,168
See?

643
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,742
The sky's as blue as a tragedy.

644
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,120
What are you on about?

645
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,581
I fancy eating a big pork cutlet.

646
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,259
I'm starving.

647
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:36,973
Oh, for a prawn tempura
and a bottle of cold beer.

648
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,145
With an electric fan blowing.

649
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,940
I bet people are tucking into it
as we speak.

650
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,071
Remember that girl in Handa?
She sent me a postcard.

651
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,615
- A picture postcard.
- I got one, too.

652
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:58,119
The one with a mole here?

653
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,871
I got one myself.

654
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:03,667
What?
What are we, three brothers?

655
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,627
What an idiot.

656
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,132
Hey, I saw that barber's daughter.

657
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,135
Don't say anything.
It's hopeless.

658
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,638
Forget her.

659
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,266
Anyway, why's the Master
so easy-going lately?

660
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:25,146
Where does he go every day?

661
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,649
I see him stepping out every day.

662
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,861
No idea.
No wonder Madame Sumiko's worried.

663
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,155
What became of that manager Kimura?

664
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:37,909
- Heard nothing from him yet.
- Not likely to, either.

665
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,328
Doesn't sound good.

666
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,374
I reckon he's run off...

667
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:48,461
...or else he'd be back by now.

668
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,008
What'll happen
if he doesn't come back?

669
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,260
We'll be stranded again.

670
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,478
Look at that up there.

671
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,898
Fly over here and drop us
some cold bottles of beer!

672
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:03,578
Is it all right, seeing each other
every day like this?

673
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,085
What about your work?

674
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:14,756
It's fine, someone's covering for me.
What about you?

675
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,384
The show's finished.

676
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,346
How come no one came to see it?

677
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,772
We'll have to say goodbye
to each other soon.

678
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,780
Listen, what will we be doing
this time next year?

679
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,950
Stop talking like that.

680
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,621
I bet you'll have found a pretty wife.

681
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,208
- I will not!
- Why not?

682
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:53,461
What about you?
What do you think?

683
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,298
Please. Don't.

684
01:08:58,342 --> 01:08:59,884
Why not?

685
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,597
- Nobody's looking at us.
- You mustn't.

686
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:06,266
But why not?

687
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,644
I'm not such a good girl.

688
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,065
I'm not good enough for you.

689
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,984
Don't be silly.

690
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,820
At first...

691
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:22,574
...I was going to seduce you.

692
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,909
I knew nothing about you.

693
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:28,580
But Madame Sumiko asked me
to meet you.

694
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:32,876
I was trying to make you
fall for me.

695
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,879
It doesn't matter how it began.

696
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,797
It doesn't matter at all.

697
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,216
It doesn't matter.

698
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:46,431
You mustn't.

699
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,517
We can't be together.

700
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,915
I wonder what became
of the manager.

701
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,668
It's troubling.

702
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:03,341
We mustn't take advantage
of the impresario's kindness.

703
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:08,763
- It's very difficult.
- It is indeed.

704
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,979
When it's good, it's good,
but when we get stranded...

705
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,065
That's our profession for you!

706
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,735
Kiyoshi's not back yet?

707
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:35,623
Why's he coming home so late?

708
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,253
He must be studying
with the postmaster.

709
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,672
He's been late the last few nights.

710
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,508
That's as maybe.

711
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:50,763
But I have to go away soon,
so I want to see him while I can.

712
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,142
Just my luck...

713
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,108
You'll be on your own again soon.

714
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,110
Is the next show in Shingu?

715
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:08,239
It's supposed to be,
but I'm not so sure now.

716
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:11,284
I've always wanted
to visit Shingu.

717
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:17,665
But you've got no relatives
living there now, have you?

718
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:24,839
Even the Tsukinoya Inn is being run
by someone else since the war.

719
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,260
Life is an unknown course.

720
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,139
The only constant is change.

721
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,981
Tell me, who is that woman?

722
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:43,399
Who?

723
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,568
That woman who came here.

724
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,404
Oh, her?
She's no good, that one.

725
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,198
Will you forgive me?

726
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:55,286
My mistake.

727
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:58,539
I should've known much better,
but by chance...

728
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,126
- Dearest...
- What?

729
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:06,381
Do you think I'm jealous?
At my age, I know better than that.

730
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,925
I'm used to your crafty ways.

731
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,010
Ouch! Is that so?

732
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:13,930
Forgive me.

733
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:20,520
But the thing is, don't you think
she might talk to Kiyoshi?

734
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,148
- About what?
- That you're his father.

735
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:28,778
I think it'll be all right.
She won't be coming here again.

736
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,696
But she might see him.

737
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:35,743
That would be awkward, yes.
But I don't think she will.

738
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,544
So...

739
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:49,465
...that means you want
to remain as his uncle?

740
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,300
That's right.

741
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:55,179
He mustn't know,
otherwise it would upset him.

742
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:56,931
Yes, but...

743
01:13:57,057 --> 01:14:01,102
Leave it as it is.
I'll just stay as his uncle for life.

744
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,249
Oi, wait there!

745
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,131
Where have you been till now?

746
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,719
Come here!

747
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,896
Come this way.

748
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,086
Who was it you were just with?

749
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:35,631
Who was it? Tell me!

750
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,428
When did you first meet him?

751
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,598
Speak up!

752
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:45,516
Tell me!

753
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:54,275
Never mind who I was seeing.

754
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:56,611
- Leave me alone.
- What?

755
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,031
What are you trying to do to him?

756
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,408
Are you trying to swindle him?

757
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,995
Is that what you think, Master?

758
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,581
Don't play the innocent with me!

759
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:12,126
I know exactly
what your type are like!

760
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:14,253
What's your excuse, then?

761
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:18,215
Speak up, if you have one!

762
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,310
It's only natural for you
to think of me that way.

763
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,562
What?

764
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:37,526
Even Madame Sumiko at first tried
to persuade me with money.

765
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:41,989
What did you say?
She tried to persuade you to do what?

766
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,119
Tell me what she told you to do!

767
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:49,413
It doesn't matter now.

768
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,707
Speak up or else!

769
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,210
That hurts! You're hurting me!

770
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,836
Tell me!

771
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:01,717
She asked me to seduce
that young man.

772
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:05,554
What? Sumiko asked you
to do that?

773
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,891
Really? That's what she asked you?

774
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,143
Is that true?

775
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:12,603
Right!

776
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,898
Bring her here this instant!

777
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:21,362
Hurry!

778
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:23,906
Bring her here now!

779
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:31,372
Right away!

780
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,719
You wanted me?

781
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,429
Come over here.

782
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,061
What is it?

783
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,940
What was that for?

784
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:43,486
You want to ruin my son,
you bitch?

785
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:47,281
I told you to lay off him, didn't I?

786
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:51,452
Why should I care about your son?

787
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:56,791
A fine boy, he is,
having an actress for a mistress!

788
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,960
You bitch,
how dare you say that!

789
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,964
Like father, like son.

790
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:25,152
Angry now?

791
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:27,696
Well, it serves you right!

792
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:35,788
And so the world turns.
You can't always be lucky.

793
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,165
I want you to remember that!

794
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:41,210
What?
You should remember it yourself!

795
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,338
You slut! You fool!

796
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:47,591
I never want to see you again!

797
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:50,344
Get away from me, you slut!

798
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,561
- Wait a moment.
- What? Let go of me!

799
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,068
Do you hate me as much as that?

800
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:07,820
What?

801
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,199
Don't you see why I had to do it?

802
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,911
You kept the truth
about that woman from me.

803
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,497
Understand how I feel.

804
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:20,708
Well, now we're even.

805
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,380
Let's just let bygones be bygones,
shall we?

806
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:28,090
Let's be friends again.

807
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:32,761
The theatre troupe's stranded,
so let's not quarrel now.

808
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,180
Shut up and save your breath!

809
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:38,726
After all you've done,
you can stop crying to me!

810
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,728
Dearest! Master!

811
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:12,593
You fool!

812
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,599
Slut!

813
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:06,146
You're all so quiet tonight.
What's up with you?

814
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,359
It's all gone belly up.

815
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,988
Come on,
pull yourselves together!

816
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,200
Get me another drink.

817
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,620
- Have you got any money?
- No problem. Eh, honey?

818
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:24,540
- I'll have one too, then.
- Me as well.

819
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:28,293
- You got any?
- Any what?

820
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,753
Any money.

821
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:33,716
You know I don't.
Don't try to embarrass me.

822
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,093
Right, honey?

823
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,978
Hey, get your hands off me,
you horrible man!

824
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,522
What's with you?

825
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:53,444
I wasn't doing anything.

826
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,864
You're talking rubbish.

827
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,326
You're awful!
Let's get out of here, Yae.

828
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,205
Hey, where are our drinks?

829
01:24:05,331 --> 01:24:07,541
No money, no drinks!

830
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:18,927
Listen, how long does the Master
intend on staying here like this?

831
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,973
Our manager's not likely to return.

832
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,270
That's why I've been thinking.

833
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:30,606
What about?

834
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,068
Forget it.

835
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,237
What is it? Go on, tell me.

836
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:44,495
Have you ever done
that sort of thing before?

837
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:47,456
Only once.
With Omi & Company.

838
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:49,708
Really? Me too.

839
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:53,796
- How about you?
- What?

840
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,923
Not so loud.

841
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,635
Let's do a runner
before it's too late.

842
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:03,347
We can use the money in
the Master's purse. How about it?

843
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,100
No way.

844
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:09,770
Listen,
you can't take loyalty that far.

845
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,272
I disagree with you!

846
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:15,484
It's not for me,
but I won't stop you two.

847
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,781
- Not so loud, please.
- I have a penetrating voice!

848
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,908
I won't tell on you, though.

849
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,996
Shall we ditch the idea?

850
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,416
Maybe we should.

851
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,210
It's obvious.

852
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:38,423
Why trifle with the Master?
After owing him so much!

853
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:44,847
A man who's ungrateful
is not a human being at all.

854
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:48,058
You guys make me sick!

855
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:53,856
I never took you two
for such delinquents.

856
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:59,403
After all these years we've been
together, what are you thinking?

857
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:05,325
It was wrong of us, I see that now.
You're right. Isn't he, Sen-chan?

858
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:08,370
I guess so.

859
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,415
Of course I'm right!

860
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:14,877
Listen, Kichi, I'm sorry.

861
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,670
Anyway, lighten up.

862
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:21,383
As long as you hear what I'm saying
and give up your stupid idea.

863
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:24,469
I understand it was a bad idea.

864
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,680
Let's have a drink, yes?

865
01:26:26,806 --> 01:26:29,892
Give us three drinks, will you?

866
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,854
Do you have enough?

867
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,522
Leave it to me.

868
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:43,405
I put some cash aside
for hard times like these.

869
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:47,993
Strange place to keep it.
It's stuffed with money, though.

870
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,413
There's a lucky charm against
pickpockets in there, too.

871
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,290
Hey, three drinks!

872
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,043
Oh, it's her.

873
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,213
Welcome.

874
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,801
Give me a hot sake.

875
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,181
Make it a flask.

876
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:14,061
It's our lucky night.
We won't be needing this.

877
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,896
Evening, madam.

878
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,192
So this is where you've been.

879
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:25,072
No news from the manager yet, then?

880
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:29,534
Not a word.

881
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,247
Chances are, madam,
he won't be coming back.

882
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,668
He's a scoundrel, that one.

883
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,673
Hey, where are our three drinks?

884
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:45,050
Be right with you.

885
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,643
How's this look?

886
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,815
More like that, no?

887
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:48,655
This is how the figures look.

888
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,870
Is that all?

889
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,124
That's the best we can do.

890
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,169
That's the very best,
mind you, Master.

891
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:04,504
I see.

892
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,466
Only that much, eh?

893
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:10,052
Very well.

894
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:14,264
Enough for train fares for everyone,
I suppose.

895
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:15,974
That's it.

896
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,560
All right, then.

897
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,897
Let's go over it again.

898
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,492
Was it only your camera
that was robbed?

899
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:38,705
- A cigarette lighter as well.
- And Kichi owes me lots of money.

900
01:29:38,831 --> 01:29:42,417
It's worse for the Master, though.
He had his purse stolen.

901
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:46,380
What a bastard.
I'll kill him if I see him.

902
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:52,594
I had my suspicions about him.
He was never straight.

903
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,929
That's right.

904
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:58,100
He even stole my charm against
pickpockets while I was sleeping!

905
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:01,186
He stole all I had, that bastard!

906
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,693
Tell me, Sensho...

907
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,572
What do you plan to do now?

908
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:15,742
What a mess we're in.

909
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:13,800
Yatazo, your cup's empty.

910
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:15,302
Thank you.

911
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:22,142
How about you?

912
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:30,358
I must ask your forgiveness
for this situation we're in.

913
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:34,112
I'm sure things will pick up
sooner or later.

914
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:38,533
I'll let you all know
when I'll be making a new start,

915
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:42,204
and if you're free,
then I'd like you to join me.

916
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:47,918
Kame-san,
where are you planning to work?

917
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:53,465
Well, my brother-in-law is running
a pickle shop at Hamamatsu.

918
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,342
Is that so?

919
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,010
And what about you?

920
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:01,056
I'm thinking of visiting
my former boss

921
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:04,142
and see if he'll take me on again.

922
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:05,852
I see.

923
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:08,313
He's the owner
of the Matsu-no-yu bathhouse?

924
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:10,357
Yes, that's right.

925
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:16,863
Those who can find other forms
of employment ought to do so.

926
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:21,326
Sugiyama, you say
you're going back to school?

927
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:23,203
Yes.

928
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:26,039
And work part-time, too.

929
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,628
We're all going our separate ways,

930
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:35,006
but I want you to remember me
from time to time.

931
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:39,052
We've been through
hard times together,

932
01:32:39,178 --> 01:32:42,222
but we've certainly
had good times, as well.

933
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:48,144
Master, as we're parting ways,
let's at least have a good send-off.

934
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:50,480
Good idea. Yes, let's.

935
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:53,900
Madame Sumiko,
why don't you come and join us?

936
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,614
It's a farewell party.

937
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,367
- Come on, madam.
- Please join in.

938
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:11,876
Please, madam, sit down.

939
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:16,298
- What happened to Kayo?
- I wonder...

940
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:19,551
Come on, auntie, cheer up!

941
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:36,067
Master, it's our last night,
so why not be nice to Madame Sumiko?

942
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:43,867
Well, Sensho, and you Roku...

943
01:33:45,077 --> 01:33:49,664
We've been together
for a long, long time, haven't we?

944
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,464
Sensho,
the Master's talking to you.

945
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:02,969
We've been through thick and thin.

946
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:07,807
I'm afraid I was rather strict
with you sometimes.

947
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:11,311
We've been together for many years.

948
01:34:12,396 --> 01:34:15,565
Forgive me, if I was...

949
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,007
Grandpa?

950
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:47,681
Grandpa!

951
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:51,351
What's wrong, Grandpa?

952
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:18,938
We're in a right mess.

953
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,274
What's happened?

954
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:24,986
The troupe's disbanded.

955
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,614
My goodness. Is that so?

956
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:33,870
The impresario has tried to help me out,
but it's all in vain.

957
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:39,584
He's been very kind to me.

958
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:43,838
Why don't you come in?

959
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:45,965
Where's Kiyoshi?

960
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:51,638
- Wasn't he with you?
- No...

961
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:55,725
A young person came for him
with a message from you.

962
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:58,686
- A young person?
- A girl.

963
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:03,483
- And he went out?
- Yes, with her.

964
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:27,340
What's the matter?

965
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:32,053
- This is terrible.
- What is it?

966
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:36,766
Kiyoshi...
He's ruined, I'm afraid.

967
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:54,409
What's happened?
What has he done?

968
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:00,748
This is awful.

969
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:04,544
What in the world has Kiyoshi done?
What's he done?

970
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:17,682
THE TAMARUYA INN

971
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:49,756
Hey...
Penny for your thoughts.

972
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,094
Any regrets?

973
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:59,140
Of course not.
I brought you here.

974
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,060
- Even so...
- Even so what?

975
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:03,937
It was my fault.

976
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,816
- We shouldn't have come.
- Why's that?

977
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:13,446
You've never had to deal
with a girl like me before.

978
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:18,242
I'm not good enough for you.
The Master must be angry.

979
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,623
Why do you say that?
My uncle has nothing to do with it.

980
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:29,462
You told me you wanted to go
to college and study, didn't you?

981
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:33,841
It's a good idea.
You should do it.

982
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:37,929
If you don't,
you'll regret it afterwards.

983
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:40,181
So you have regrets, then?

984
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,850
I don't need to go to college.

985
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:53,528
I want to tell my mother
about our plans.

986
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,905
She'll give us her blessing.

987
01:39:56,031 --> 01:39:59,867
- Even if she doesn't, I'll...
- No, it won't work.

988
01:40:01,286 --> 01:40:05,498
You should just go back home
to your mother.

989
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:07,625
Please, go back home.

990
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:11,295
Go home and do what?
What's the point?

991
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:16,384
This is farewell.
Here and now, for good.

992
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:19,053
And what will become of you?

993
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:21,597
The whole troupe's been disbanded.

994
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:25,727
You should just forget
about a girl like me.

995
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,896
I'll get by, somehow or other.

996
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,024
Don't be silly!

997
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:33,276
Please! Go home!

998
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:37,989
Go back home.

999
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,037
Please, go home. Please...

1000
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:27,580
I wonder where he's gone.

1001
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,965
Like father, like son,
I suppose.

1002
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:43,221
He's a fast worker.
I didn't know that.

1003
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:49,602
I had high hopes for him, like "a kite
can give birth to a hawk", as they say.

1004
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:55,942
I guess I was too optimistic
about his chances in this world.

1005
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:00,863
It's all been too much for me
this time.

1006
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:05,952
All my plans have gone to pieces.

1007
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:14,001
Listen, my dear,
you're worrying yourself too much.

1008
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:20,007
When he's taken all his savings
and eloped with a girl like that,

1009
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:22,802
how do you expect me
to think positively?

1010
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,972
Honestly,
I'm very disappointed in him.

1011
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,644
Even so...

1012
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,856
...I'm sure he'll come home.

1013
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:43,281
He's not a bad boy. He'll come home.

1014
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:45,908
You think so?

1015
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:48,870
You think he'll come home?

1016
01:42:51,373 --> 01:42:53,374
I don't know what I'll do
if he doesn't.

1017
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:02,675
I know...

1018
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:10,099
I just don't understand
the youth of today.

1019
01:43:11,393 --> 01:43:12,977
He'll come home.

1020
01:43:14,062 --> 01:43:15,938
He's bound to come home.

1021
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,905
Listen, when he comes home,

1022
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,824
why don't you settle down here?

1023
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:30,411
And tell Kiyoshi the truth.

1024
01:43:30,537 --> 01:43:34,040
He's old enough now to understand.

1025
01:43:36,084 --> 01:43:38,085
He'll find out one day.

1026
01:43:42,299 --> 01:43:44,550
He's bound to find out in the end.

1027
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:51,974
It wouldn't have come to this,
if we'd told him.

1028
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,061
Please, tell him the whole truth.

1029
01:43:59,441 --> 01:44:02,235
Please tell him.

1030
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,573
And the three of us living together?

1031
01:44:08,992 --> 01:44:10,868
I wish you would.

1032
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:16,123
- Shall we?
- Would you?

1033
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,584
Thank you so much.

1034
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,544
Kiyoshi will be delighted.

1035
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:29,762
But... where can he be now?

1036
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:37,228
Shall I make you a drink?

1037
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,440
Warm sake, yes?

1038
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,868
Oh, here he is!

1039
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,376
Where have you been?

1040
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:06,465
Where've you been?

1041
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:12,013
- I have a favour to ask you, Mother.
- What is it?

1042
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,487
You?

1043
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:32,533
How dare you show up here?

1044
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:34,076
You fool!

1045
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:37,288
I'm sorry, Master.

1046
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:43,169
I'm the one who's sorry! You slut!

1047
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:48,215
Stop it, Uncle!
Don't hit her, she's apologising.

1048
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:52,887
What? How dare you
worry your mother like this!

1049
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:56,682
Please don't, my dear.

1050
01:45:57,559 --> 01:46:01,228
Shut up!
They deserve punishment!

1051
01:46:03,398 --> 01:46:05,066
- You slut!
- Stop it, Uncle.

1052
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:09,570
- What? How dare you...!
- Please stop it!

1053
01:46:12,824 --> 01:46:15,368
What do you think you're doing?

1054
01:46:24,419 --> 01:46:26,462
- What the...?
- What?

1055
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:34,845
Do you know who he is?

1056
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:39,475
He's your father. Your real father.

1057
01:46:39,601 --> 01:46:41,477
How dare you?

1058
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:47,024
Just as I thought.

1059
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,361
That's what I thought all along.

1060
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:58,411
Mother, you said my father worked
at the town hall in Shingu,

1061
01:46:58,537 --> 01:47:00,788
and that he'd died years ago.

1062
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:06,293
I believed it. I still believe it.

1063
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:10,005
I don't need a father.
I don't want a father in my life.

1064
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:11,882
I don't need one.

1065
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:22,309
He didn't want you to know
you were the son of an itinerant actor.

1066
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:25,938
He didn't want you to feel ashamed.

1067
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:30,151
How come? How come?

1068
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:34,697
He wanted you to study hard
and become somebody.

1069
01:47:36,616 --> 01:47:41,912
So your father worked hard and
sent me your school expenses.

1070
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:43,539
That's enough.

1071
01:47:43,665 --> 01:47:46,250
- Stop it.
- But...

1072
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:47,835
Listen, Uncle...

1073
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:52,298
Why did you show up
all of a sudden?

1074
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:55,968
And why are you only telling me
all this now, Mother?

1075
01:47:56,094 --> 01:47:58,095
You two are so selfish.

1076
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:01,015
I don't need a father.

1077
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,516
Get out!

1078
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:07,771
Get lost!

1079
01:48:09,065 --> 01:48:10,649
Get out!

1080
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,336
Forgive me.

1081
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:35,299
I knew nothing about it.

1082
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:39,970
I'm afraid he's right.

1083
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:42,056
He's quite right.

1084
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:47,228
One can't suddenly show up
out of nowhere

1085
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:49,813
and assert one's parental authority.

1086
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:54,360
Why are you talking like that, dear?

1087
01:48:56,321 --> 01:48:59,698
I think I'll set out on my travels
after all.

1088
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:04,995
It would be for the best,
better for all.

1089
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:10,417
But Kiyoshi isn't angry with you
anymore.

1090
01:49:11,294 --> 01:49:16,048
Well, I'm going to start from scratch.

1091
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:28,936
It's best I part company with him
as his uncle. As I've always been.

1092
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:36,443
Next time I pass through here,

1093
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:40,781
I'll be a great actor
and he can be proud of his father.

1094
01:49:40,907 --> 01:49:43,576
Let me look forward to that.

1095
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,789
I will do that.

1096
01:49:49,332 --> 01:49:51,041
But, my dear...

1097
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:55,379
Then we'll celebrate my success.

1098
01:49:58,466 --> 01:49:59,883
Master!

1099
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:04,763
Take me with you.

1100
01:50:05,557 --> 01:50:08,601
I'll work hard for you.

1101
01:50:09,686 --> 01:50:15,149
I can't part with you like this,
I just can't!

1102
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:22,948
Master, I'm begging you,
take me with you.

1103
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:26,118
I beg you.

1104
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:29,455
Did you hear that?

1105
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:32,666
How pathetic of her.

1106
01:50:37,922 --> 01:50:41,175
Be good enough
to look after her as well.

1107
01:50:42,802 --> 01:50:45,179
I'm sorry I scolded you.

1108
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:47,806
Forgive me.

1109
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,856
Make a fine man
out of Kiyoshi for me.

1110
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:58,525
I'm counting on you.

1111
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:04,031
You understand? Oblige me.

1112
01:51:21,299 --> 01:51:22,716
Kiyoshi!

1113
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:35,896
Kiyoshi! It's the Master...

1114
01:51:37,565 --> 01:51:41,652
Hurry up, go to him! Hurry!

1115
01:51:42,278 --> 01:51:43,987
Quickly!

1116
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:01,547
Where's Uncle? Where's he gone?

1117
01:52:05,009 --> 01:52:07,344
What's happened to Uncle?

1118
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,389
Your father?

1119
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:16,395
Your father's left for the road.

1120
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:25,070
Don't stop him.

1121
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:36,623
Leave him be.

1122
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:40,753
Every time your father
visited this town,

1123
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:43,130
ever since you were a baby,

1124
01:52:43,256 --> 01:52:46,967
he always left like that,
with a heavy heart.

1125
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:52,431
Leave things as they are.

1126
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:58,103
But only if you can become
somebody in life.

1127
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:19,620
Where are you going, Master?

1128
01:55:31,132 --> 01:55:32,799
Give me a light.

1129
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:45,228
Tell me,
where are you going?

1130
01:55:53,154 --> 01:55:56,281
I'm at a loss where to go now.

1131
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:00,577
Are you heading somewhere, Master?

1132
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:12,464
Tell me, where?

1133
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:14,508
Where are you going?

1134
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:20,138
To Kuwana.

1135
01:56:21,432 --> 01:56:23,308
Where in Kuwana?

1136
01:56:24,268 --> 01:56:29,815
I think Kaneyoshi, the impresario,
may have an opening for me.

1137
01:56:31,609 --> 01:56:35,153
I see.
I wonder if I could go with you.

1138
01:56:42,912 --> 01:56:45,831
I happen to know
that impresario very well.

1139
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,793
Is there no way
we could go together?

1140
01:56:51,504 --> 01:56:53,171
It's sink-or-swim for me.

1141
01:56:56,384 --> 01:56:58,343
Shall we give it one more try?

1142
01:56:59,387 --> 01:57:01,555
Let's try. Yes, let's!

1143
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:03,390
Give it a go?

1144
01:57:03,516 --> 01:57:05,684
Yes, we'll work it out.

1145
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:08,353
Let's go.

1146
01:57:12,942 --> 01:57:15,027
Two tickets to Kuwana.

1147
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:20,032
Hey, don't forget your luggage
over there.

1148
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,690
How is it?
