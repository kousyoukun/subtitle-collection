It's hot, isn't it?

16
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,211
Good day.

17
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:38,797
I can't cope in this heat.

18
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:43,635
What are they showing next
at the Aioi Theatre?

19
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:47,264
These Kabuki plays.

20
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,891
Lots of swordfights, eh?

21
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:54,313
I really liked that strip show
last month.

22
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:59,568
Remember that girl in pink panties
with the big arse?

23
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,237
The new shows aren't like that.

24
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:05,991
- It's grand Kabuki.
- Is that right?

25
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,870
This troupe is coming all the way

26
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:13,123
via Okazaki, Kariya
and Cape Chita.

27
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:15,083
Is that right?

28
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,128
You'll let me in for free, then, right?

29
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:24,468
I remember I saw this troupe
17, 18 years ago.

30
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:29,222
It was in Yamada town,
I saw this actor Komajuro.

31
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,393
- Really?
- He was really good as well.

32
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,854
He played the role
of Marubashi Chuya.

33
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,148
"A pint here and a quart there

34
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:41,485
"Quite a lot that I'm aware"

35
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:43,028
Is that so?

36
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:46,365
I wonder if the boat'll be late again.

37
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:51,620
Not that I've heard.
I think she'll be here on the dot.

38
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:54,289
That's once in a blue moon, right?

39
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:55,874
Indeed it is.

40
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:01,129
It's going to be hot today.

41
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:23,936
- Hey! Are we running late?
- No, we're almost there.

42
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:39,201
Master?

43
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,579
Dearest!

44
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,583
Almost there?

45
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,545
Kayo, you bring that, please.

46
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,549
It's fine.

47
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,593
Was this yours?

48
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,983
Don't leave anything behind.

49
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,194
- Are you ready, Roku?
- Aye.

50
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,196
- You too?
- Eh?

51
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,406
Don't forget anything!

52
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:17,953
Don't forget me, dear

53
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,706
Don't forget me

54
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:51,486
The Arashi Komajuro Troupe
Playing At The Aioi Theatre

55
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,622
Komajuro Arashi & His Troupe

56
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,097
- Give me one!
- Oi, give us one!

57
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:46,560
- Come on, you miser!
- What? You got any older sisters?

58
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:48,437
- No.
- I do!

59
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:50,230
Right, then...

60
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,066
- How old is she?
- Twelve.

61
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,609
Idiot!

62
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:16,372
Afternoon.

63
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,541
Put this up, will you?

64
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:23,170
- At the Aioi Theatre, eh?
- Come and see us.

65
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:27,008
Hey, listen,
does it start from tonight?

66
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:30,469
Er... that's right.

67
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,305
I see...

68
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,154
Oh, hello there.

69
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:50,573
I'll be coming tonight.

70
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:53,326
Please do.
I'll be expecting you.

71
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,010
Your wife's here, sir!

72
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,851
- So... business is good, eh?
- Well...

73
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:21,645
Can I take a match?

74
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,860
Listen...

75
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,447
What's your name?

76
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:34,575
Kinnosuke.

77
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,327
Kinnosuke?

78
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:40,039
I'm Kin-chan.

79
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,540
Oh, no way?

80
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,085
No way!

81
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,886
- He wants another sake, Master.
- All right.

82
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,101
Afternoon.

83
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,872
I'll be expecting you tonight.

84
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:05,833
Let's go together, Okatsu.

85
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:10,004
And who'll take care
of the customers, eh?

86
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:13,216
Please come. I'll be waiting.

87
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,514
Goodbye.

88
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,646
I'll be seeing you.

89
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,113
He's generous, that one.

90
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:45,915
So that actor's from Osaka, is he?

91
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,876
He's an old-timer
around these parts.

92
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:52,755
He once played in our town, as well.

93
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:57,342
They say he used to play
at the big Kado Theatre in Osaka.

94
00:10:58,374 --> 00:10:59,892
Is that so? That means that...

95
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:02,151
Don't move or you'll get cut.

96
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,520
Oh, my.
Please don't cut me, Aiko.

97
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,233
Good day!

98
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:16,614
- Please take these.
- Thank you.

99
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,532
Hot, isn't it?

100
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,451
Awfully hot.

101
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:26,290
Is that your daughter?
Very pretty.

102
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,251
Good day.
Are you helping your dad out?

103
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:33,088
Good girl. Most admirable.

104
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:37,676
You can rest assured, eh?

105
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,603
"Ogawa Aiko"?
That's a pretty name.

106
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:50,648
So, Aiko-chan,
are you the only child?

107
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:55,653
The apple of his eye, eh?
And a great help to your dad.

108
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,489
Will you marry her off to a barber?
Listen, Aiko...

109
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:01,825
Marry a good-looking fellow,
a man like me.

110
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:02,595
Good and kind-hearted.

111
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,393
You're such a pretty little thing.

112
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,603
Really, you are!

113
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,683
Shokichi, make me a cup of tea.

114
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:04,369
- We're back.
- You must be tired.

115
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,214
We're back.

116
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,976
- Well done.
- You must be exhausted.

117
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:30,791
It's so hot.

118
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:37,837
Hey... bring me my kimono over,
would you?

119
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:43,301
- Where are you off to?
- I have to visit a patron.

120
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,355
- Welcome.
- Oh, welcome, sir.

121
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,649
Please come in.

122
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:01,736
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much indeed.

123
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:16,471
Come through, sir.

124
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:19,234
The impresario's here, Master.

125
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,777
Please come up.

126
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:21,825
Please.

127
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:26,579
It's been such a long time.

128
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,291
It's been a while indeed.

129
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:34,128
Yes. It's wonderful
to be back here again.

130
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:36,631
When was the last time?

131
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:40,301
Wasn't it during those hard times
just after the war ended?

132
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:45,014
It was. It's already
twelve years since then.

133
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,558
That many years?

134
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:49,894
Well, time flies.

135
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,022
I see several new faces.

136
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:57,109
Well, with the changing times,
you know.

137
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,655
This is Sumiko, sir.

138
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,751
Very pleased to meet you.

139
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:09,923
What happened to that fellow
who played "Yasu The Bat"?

140
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,092
Oh, you mean Tatsunosuke?

141
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:14,762
He died at Fukuchiyama.

142
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,473
Is that so? What happened?

143
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,183
He had a stroke.

144
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,604
Such a good actor, too.
I'm sorry to hear that.

145
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:28,192
And this is Tatsunosuke's daughter.

146
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:35,032
You've grown up
into a fine young woman.

147
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:38,452
She used to be just like
a Chinese nut.

148
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,416
What's a Chinese nut?

149
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,418
It's a peanut!

150
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:53,300
How can we help you, Kimura?

151
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,056
I'll be off now, Master.
Is there anything else...?

152
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:02,067
I'll let you know.

153
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:05,008
Flat rate, as you said?

154
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,585
That'll be fine.

155
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:11,214
- Where's your next stop?
- Shingu in Kii Province.

156
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,715
Oh, I see.

157
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,510
I'll be off, then.

158
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,228
Master, the impresario
has brought us a gift.

159
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:27,104
Thank you, sir.

160
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,315
- Many thanks, sir.
- Thank you.

161
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,692
Let's join together and give thanks.

162
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:37,365
Let's give thanks...
And twice!

163
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:39,951
And thrice!

164
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:43,746
Congratulations!

165
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:20,575
- Is that the actor that's just arrived?
- Looks a bit old for it.

166
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,133
Excuse me?

167
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,222
Welcome.

168
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:44,891
Could I have a flask of sake?

169
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:49,521
- I'll leave the money here.
- Thank you.

170
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,904
I've been expecting you.
I saw the parade.

171
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:01,033
It's been a while.
You haven't changed a bit.

172
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:04,037
Come inside.
It's much cooler in here.

173
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:06,931
Really? Thanks, I'll come in.

174
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,192
- There you go.
- Thanks.

175
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:20,194
I'm glad to see you look well.

176
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,321
- You too.
- Thank you.

177
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,156
It's been twelve years.

178
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:31,664
So many years,
it must've been hard by yourself.

179
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,794
You had a frozen shoulder
the last time we met.

180
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,671
Are you all right now?

181
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:41,423
Did I, indeed?

182
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:45,761
You kept telling me
the pain was killing you.

183
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:49,056
Is that so? Well, it's fine now.

184
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:52,142
There's a nice breeze here.

185
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,119
- Sorry to be a bother.
- Not at all.

186
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:12,496
Thank you so much.

187
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:16,500
How's Kiyoshi? Is he well?

188
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,212
He finished school
the year before last.

189
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,256
So you said in your letter.

190
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:26,051
Oh, did I? He's working now.

191
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:28,679
- Where?
- The post office.

192
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:30,556
It's only part-time.

193
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:33,517
He's keen to study electronics
at college.

194
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:35,227
Good for him.

195
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:38,147
But then I'll be all on my own here.

196
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:40,649
That's not good for you.

197
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:44,403
- But he's saving money for college.
- Is he?

198
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:46,822
I don't want to discourage him.

199
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:48,282
You're right.

200
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,292
Tell me...

201
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:02,796
Does Kiyoshi...
know anything about me?

202
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:11,971
Does he think his father's dead?

203
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,683
And that I'm only your brother?

204
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,254
Your flowers are doing well.

205
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:50,093
Don't you ever feel lonely?

206
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:54,055
- About what?
- About Kiyoshi.

207
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:56,432
Can't be helped.

208
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,769
He deserves someone better
than the likes of me.

209
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,039
Yes, but...

210
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,752
- Let's not talk about it.
- I know, but...

211
00:21:07,878 --> 00:21:11,047
Leave it.
And let it remain that way.

212
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:22,016
I feel sorry for you, though.
Anyway...

213
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:26,771
- Have a drink.
- Thank you.

214
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:31,693
What can be done?

215
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,412
Oh, that's Kiyoshi.

216
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,041
Welcome home.

217
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:50,754
Oh, you're here, Uncle.

218
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:55,383
I'd have come home sooner.

219
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,765
- Are you working?
- I was studying with the postmaster.

220
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:02,725
Look how you've grown!

221
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:05,144
He'd have been of conscription age.

222
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,063
Really?
A first-class soldier, no doubt!

223
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,071
He's grown up so much.

224
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:19,408
No hope for us oldies, eh?

225
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,503
It's been years since we last met.

226
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:34,799
How long are you staying, Uncle?

227
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:38,010
As long as we draw an audience.
Six months, a year, maybe.

228
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:41,555
- It won't run that long.
- It will!

229
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:46,811
Is this your work?

230
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:50,481
- What's this?
- Don't touch it.

231
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:53,442
I'll come to the show tonight.
What part do you play?

232
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:56,946
Don't come.
It's not your kind of show.

233
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:58,989
Whose kind of show is it?

234
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:04,502
- Well, the audience's.
- Aren't I one of them?

235
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:08,673
I know that, but it's nothing
very sophisticated. Forget about it.

236
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,844
So why do you put on such plays?
Why not show something better?

237
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,722
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

238
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:19,643
Today's audiences don't
understand quality plays.

239
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,853
So don't bother coming.

240
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:27,692
The last time,
we went fishing together.

241
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:30,695
- What fish do you catch now?
- Well...

242
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:33,573
- It doesn't matter. Let's go again.
- In this heat?

243
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:36,493
I don't mind the heat.
Let's go, shall we?

244
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:39,704
- How about tomorrow, Sunday?
- Shall we?

245
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,206
Yes, let's go.

246
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:45,085
We're definitely going?

247
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,967
He's really grown up.

248
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:58,682
- Has the sake chilled?
- No, it's fine.

249
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:06,148
He's certainly good
at arguing his point of view.

250
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,985
What did you argue about?

251
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:12,404
He's wise for his years.

252
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,822
Clever lad.

253
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:34,760
Welcome, all!

254
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:46,521
Welcome, two good patrons!

255
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:52,152
Welcome!

256
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:58,408
- Tetsu!
- Aye?

257
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:03,246
- Sadahachi?
- What is it, Boss?

258
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:08,626
This is our last night
on Mount Akagi

259
00:25:10,171 --> 00:25:14,466
I'm leaving my home village
of Kunisada

260
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:17,427
And leaving my territory

261
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,099
I must take my leave of you, too,
my loyal vassals

262
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:29,564
This is my final farewell
to the Kunisada clan

263
00:25:30,357 --> 00:25:35,779
Hearing you speak so,
I am filled with chagrin

264
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:43,495
The geese call out
as they cross the southern skies

265
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:50,835
The moon is slipping
behind the western hills

266
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:54,756
Where shall I venture now?

267
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:58,426
Wherever my legs carry me

268
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:04,182
I will roam aimlessly
to the end of the world

269
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,201
Boss!

270
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:11,456
Is that not Brother Enzo?

271
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:15,127
Stout-hearted as he is...

272
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:21,925
...he must feel lonesome
leaving his home village

273
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:46,616
O, illustrious blade

274
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:53,457
Thoroughly tempered by
the famous Yoshikane of Kaga

275
00:26:54,667 --> 00:27:00,839
Purified in the rivers
of the perpetual snows

276
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:13,373
You, at least, will protect me

277
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:19,962
You will be at my side,
faithful one!

278
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,853
The geese fly away

279
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,402
The crows too lament for me

280
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,625
Well done.

281
00:28:05,672 --> 00:28:07,632
Take a look at that one.

282
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,469
- The barber's daughter.
- Which one?

283
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:15,556
You see the old dame
with a towel on her head?

284
00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:18,643
Behind her.
She's eating a bun now.

285
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,948
What a big mouth she has.

286
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:35,660
Which one is your find?
Is she here?

287
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:39,747
She's out there. It's that one.

288
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:42,541
The one smoking,
in the white kimono.

289
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,509
She's lovely looking.

290
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:54,845
A real find, too.
Which one's mine?

291
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:57,890
Yours hasn't come.

292
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:01,727
She's even prettier, mind.
Not my taste, though.

293
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,662
Really? I can't wait.

294
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,838
That's naughty, stop it.

295
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:27,308
It went down well?
How were the takings?

296
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:32,397
Three-quarters full,
not bad for an opening.

297
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:38,027
It'll fill up, you'll see.

298
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,406
- I hope so.
- It'll be fine.

299
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,992
It was the same
for the shows in Kariya.

300
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,578
Why are you so pessimistic
these days?

301
00:29:46,704 --> 00:29:50,081
- I'm not at all.
- Don't you worry.

302
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:51,916
Mark my words.

303
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,586
It'll pick up, I'm sure.

304
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:30,079
Where do you go
after that scene in Kunisada?

305
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,291
I climb down Mount Akagi.

306
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,960
After that, I mean.

307
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:39,964
Don't you see?
I head straight for you, don't I?

308
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,133
Oh, you are awful.

309
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:45,386
I'm not awful at all.

310
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,306
Ah, here he comes.

311
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,394
Welcome.

312
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,521
- Hello.
- Over here.

313
00:31:02,142 --> 00:31:05,227
It's so hot.
Sweat's pouring off me.

314
00:31:07,022 --> 00:31:08,689
So where's my girl?

315
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:11,233
Don't worry, she's coming.

316
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:15,821
- Where's the Master?
- He's gone out.

317
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:18,199
Let's have a drink.

318
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:22,620
Hurry up, Yae,
your man's waiting.

319
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:34,382
Oh, welcome. Good day to you!

320
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:40,179
- This one?
- She's your type.

321
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,264
You've got to be joking.

322
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,352
- No good?
- Stop taking the mickey.

323
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:49,855
What are you talking about?
Look at me.

324
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:54,360
- A chill’s running down my spine.
- Have a drink, then.

325
00:31:56,321 --> 00:32:01,075
Kichi, you're a black-hearted fellow.
I misjudged you.

326
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:03,411
- How's that?
- Don't give me that!

327
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:04,954
Here...

328
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,416
Look at me, I'm depressed now.

329
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:11,043
- Why's that?
- Please don't ask.

330
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:14,130
- My mother's just passed away.
- Really?

331
00:32:14,256 --> 00:32:17,258
It's no good, I'm catching a chill.

332
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:20,511
- Let her warm you up, then!
- Welcome.

333
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:22,263
All’s well?

334
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:24,849
Are you coming in?

335
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:30,062
- What's your name, darling?
- Katsuko.

336
00:32:30,188 --> 00:32:32,022
What a pretty name.

337
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:35,693
What a find, Senta!
Have a good time.

338
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:37,778
I'm just off out.

339
00:32:37,904 --> 00:32:40,114
- So long.
- So long.

340
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,741
Do come again!

341
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:46,871
Hey, Senta...

342
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:49,707
What's got into you, Sentaro?

343
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:55,921
"Though all the world betrays me..."

344
00:32:56,047 --> 00:32:58,048
Oh, just give me some sake. Hurry!

345
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:01,135
Oh, this fella could lead me astray!

346
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:04,685
Bring on the sake, Master!

347
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:06,103
Right-o.

348
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,865
- Afternoon.
- Welcome.

349
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:20,909
- Where's your dad today?
- Out at a meeting.

350
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:23,495
I see. Hot, isn't it?

351
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,878
- Did you come to see my dad?
- I couldn't care less about your dad.

352
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:33,255
It's you I came to see.

353
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,049
Disgusting!

354
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:42,222
I'm being serious, Aiko.
Just feel how my heart's beating.

355
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:45,350
- Go on.
- Mama! Mama!

356
00:33:47,437 --> 00:33:48,937
What is it?

357
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,279
What's going on?
What do you want?

358
00:33:57,405 --> 00:34:00,282
Well... I was wondering
if I could get a shave.

359
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:02,242
Aiko, go inside.

360
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:10,501
If you please...

361
00:34:12,462 --> 00:34:14,463
There's not that much growth...

362
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:17,800
Maybe I can do without a shave.

363
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:19,969
Maybe I won't.

364
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:23,597
- Sit down.
- Yes, thank you.

365
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:09,185
They're not biting, Uncle.

366
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:13,606
Be patient, they'll start biting.

367
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:19,361
Isn't your head getting hot?
Here, put this on.

368
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,280
I'm fine.

369
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:25,493
- I think you overdid it a bit.
- What do you mean?

370
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,454
Your performance,
it was a bit hammy.

371
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,372
Don't talk nonsense!

372
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,291
It was all right.

373
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:39,465
But that character Marubashi
is totally unrealistic.

374
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:43,135
Unrealistic?

375
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:45,179
He doesn't relate to today's world.

376
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,139
You're talking rubbish!

377
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:50,601
Marubashi is a character
from another era.

378
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:54,855
You just don't understand.
It's old fashioned.

379
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,693
You think you know it all.

380
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:07,034
The audience likes my performance
whether it's hammy or old fashioned.

381
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:10,538
So as long as the audience is happy,
it's all right?

382
00:36:10,664 --> 00:36:13,666
Give it a rest,
talking about the theatre.

383
00:36:15,293 --> 00:36:18,671
Look at that,
I've lost my bait again.

384
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:28,055
I hear you want to go to college?

385
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:33,602
I'm in favour of you studying...

386
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:36,981
...but your poor mother will be lonely.

387
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,858
Doesn't matter.

388
00:36:38,984 --> 00:36:42,444
It certainly does.
Imagine how she'd feel.

389
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:44,238
She's a good mother to you.

390
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:49,660
But she approves of me studying,
so it's all right.

391
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,996
It's not all right.

392
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:55,332
Don't upset her.
She's a good mother.

393
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,449
Don't be so clumsy!

394
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,385
Was the bath hot enough, Miss?

395
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:54,139
Absolutely perfect. I'm done now.

396
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,050
There's no cold water, though.

397
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:16,185
That was a lovely bath.

398
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,231
- The Master's not back yet?
- No.

399
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,236
Where did he go?

400
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:30,450
- He went fishing, didn't he?
- Fishing?

401
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:34,412
I was having a shave
at the barber's.

402
00:38:34,538 --> 00:38:37,290
I saw him pass by
with a young man.

403
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,418
- A young man?
- Don't you know him?

404
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:43,838
He's a post office clerk,
I saw him in the mirror.

405
00:38:43,964 --> 00:38:45,381
Really?

406
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:47,759
- What happened to you here?
- Well...

407
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,429
- I got cut at the barber's.
- I see...

408
00:38:52,222 --> 00:38:55,099
Kayo, go ahead and have a bath.

409
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:57,769
All right, then.

410
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,917
Supper's ready, you lot. Supper!

411
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,754
Get up, Grandpa, it's supper!

412
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:24,887
Let's carry on later.

413
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:32,562
Supper time.

414
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:34,731
Were you out with her?

415
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:38,943
- Welcome home.
- Evening.

416
00:39:42,698 --> 00:39:44,490
Welcome home.

417
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:46,284
Where have you been?

418
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,328
I was out with the boys.

419
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:52,957
- Good catch?
- What?

420
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,500
Fish, of course!

421
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,547
Did you catch anything, Kichi?

422
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:07,388
He landed himself a puffer fish.
A great big fat thing, it was!

423
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:10,516
- Good catch, eh?
- It's no joke!

424
00:40:12,936 --> 00:40:14,603
See you later.

425
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:20,484
- Were you really together?
- With whom?

426
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,362
- With the boys.
- Yeah.

427
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:27,241
- So where did you go?
- Just fishing.

428
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:31,871
Really? So who was the young man
you were with?

429
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:34,540
Oh, one of my patron's sons.

430
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,085
A post office clerk?

431
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:42,882
- Who told you that?
- Never mind who told me.

432
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,383
Very well.

433
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:48,971
- Who told you?
- You seem bothered by it.

434
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:54,685
- Why are you acting strange?
- Why?

435
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:57,605
- Are you feeling guilty?
- About what?

436
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:01,150
Ah, I see. You're jealous!

437
00:41:02,122 --> 00:41:04,332
Stop it, you silly thing!

438
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:11,714
Why would I fool around
with other women when I've got you?

439
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,092
I'm not a spring chicken any more!

440
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:17,095
You know me. Don't you?

441
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:19,180
Don't sweet-talk me.

442
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:48,084
Hey, you must know something.

443
00:41:49,044 --> 00:41:51,879
Why won't you tell me?

444
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:59,345
Listen, I won't say you told me.

445
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,578
I won't tell anyone.
What do you know?

446
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,872
Tell me.

447
00:42:09,835 --> 00:42:11,586
Oi, Masa, be careful!

448
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,350
You've known the Master for years.

449
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,186
Right? You ought to know.

450
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:32,065
You came here with him
before my time.

451
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:35,860
So tell me.
I'm begging you. Please.

452
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:39,239
Can't be helped.

453
00:42:40,366 --> 00:42:42,867
What can't be helped?

454
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,371
What is it?

455
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:50,250
What can't be helped?

456
00:42:51,877 --> 00:42:53,878
He's bound to see...

457
00:42:55,214 --> 00:42:57,048
...his old flame.

458
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,093
Is that so?

459
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,762
Just what I thought.

460
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:09,310
So, who is she?
Where is she?

461
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:16,734
What kind of person is she?
What's she like?

462
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,572
Better ask Rokusaburo.

463
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:25,076
He knows her as well? I see.

464
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:28,705
So Roku knows about her too?

465
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,075
How can you stand this, Master?

466
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:26,662
- Stand what?
- Such an empty house.

467
00:45:29,249 --> 00:45:31,709
Why did we have to come here?

468
00:45:54,232 --> 00:45:55,983
What is it, Roku?

469
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:57,902
She's out there.

470
00:45:58,737 --> 00:45:59,987
I see.

471
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:13,375
- Which one?
- That one.

472
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:18,547
In front of that pillar
in the opposite corner, with the fan.

473
00:46:41,863 --> 00:46:44,573
Thank you, Roku. I owe you.

474
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:01,573
What an insult!

475
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:03,157
What's up?

476
00:47:04,243 --> 00:47:05,577
It's awful!

477
00:47:06,745 --> 00:47:09,872
What are you grumbling on about?

478
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:14,043
You can't help an empty house
when it's empty.

479
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:21,509
Is that rain?

480
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,138
Hey, is it raining?

481
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:31,394
- It's started spitting.
- Oh, right.

482
00:47:32,104 --> 00:47:34,022
Misfortunes never come alone.

483
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,442
Swift is heaven's vengeance!

484
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:41,696
What are you hinting at?
Don't start complaining.

485
00:47:41,822 --> 00:47:45,908
I've had enough of it.
You're giving me a headache already.

486
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:49,871
Serves you right.
I knew this would happen.

487
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,167
Hey! Behave yourself!

488
00:48:49,982 --> 00:48:52,608
- Hold on a minute.
- Again?

489
00:48:53,193 --> 00:48:56,487
If I go there...
And then there...

490
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:00,700
There.

491
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:02,994
- Are you done?
- Fine. Go ahead.

492
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:09,583
- Checkmate.
- Eh? Hang on...

493
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,169
That's no good. Wait a second.

494
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:14,505
- No way.
- Wait, wait!

495
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,926
Let this old man get
his head straight...

496
00:49:19,052 --> 00:49:22,888
If I avoid that, you'll come there...

497
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:24,390
No good.

498
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:28,310
If I go there... you go...

499
00:49:29,229 --> 00:49:31,230
That's no good, either...

500
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:36,360
What are you on about? Hurry up!

501
00:49:36,486 --> 00:49:39,613
Hang on! If I go there...

502
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,906
Hurry up!

503
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:45,036
Just... hold... your... horses!

504
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:46,871
There!

505
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:17,456
Good afternoon.

506
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,792
A flask of sake.

507
00:50:22,546 --> 00:50:25,006
- Tell me, madam...
- Yes?

508
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:33,681
Is Master Komajuro
from my troupe here?

509
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:36,017
Yes, he is indeed.

510
00:50:36,143 --> 00:50:38,352
Would you call him for me?

511
00:50:50,824 --> 00:50:53,200
- Listen...
- What is it?

512
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:57,913
- A visitor for you.
- Who?

513
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:04,870
Wait for me.
I'll be back to defeat you.

514
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:08,040
- I don't mind letting you win a game.
- Fool!

515
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,713
I was going easy on you.

516
00:51:14,548 --> 00:51:16,299
Don't mess with the board.

517
00:51:26,018 --> 00:51:28,728
What do you want?

518
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:34,600
Why are you here?

519
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:40,147
- Am I not allowed here?
- What are you saying?

520
00:51:40,273 --> 00:51:44,818
So your "important patron"
was the proprietress here?

521
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:55,389
- Where are you going?
- I must offer thanks to your "patron".

522
00:51:55,932 --> 00:51:57,724
Wait! Stop!

523
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,810
What's the problem?

524
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:08,234
I must thank you for attending
to Komajuro's needs.

525
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:14,682
Don't play the innocent with me.

526
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,144
Go away!

527
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:21,814
- Get going!
- What are you doing?

528
00:52:22,983 --> 00:52:25,943
Hey, you. Are you her son?

529
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:27,611
Hey, stop it.

530
00:52:30,324 --> 00:52:33,868
Who's your father?
What does he do?

531
00:52:33,994 --> 00:52:36,454
- What are you saying?
- Why are you so flustered?

532
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,041
What a fine son you have,
eh, madam?

533
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:43,085
- You're leaving.
- I have something to tell them!

534
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:45,379
Let go! Let go of me!

535
00:52:45,505 --> 00:52:47,673
What are you saying, you fool? Leave!

536
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:49,550
Let me go! Let me go!

537
00:53:32,394 --> 00:53:34,687
You're an idiot! A fool!

538
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:37,147
What were you thinking?
Behave yourself!

539
00:53:37,273 --> 00:53:39,149
To hell with you!

540
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,196
How dare you interfere,
you meddling fool!

541
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:55,735
You have no say in their affairs!

542
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:59,363
What's wrong
with me seeing my son?

543
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:01,449
My own son!

544
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:05,786
What are your objections?
If you have any, say so, you fool!

545
00:54:06,755 --> 00:54:09,715
Fine words coming from you!

546
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:12,051
What did you say, you bitch?

547
00:54:12,177 --> 00:54:14,345
How dare you mouth off at me!

548
00:54:14,471 --> 00:54:17,265
- You think I'll listen to you?
- I beg your pardon?

549
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:21,769
Have you forgotten about Okaya
and who got you out of that hole?

550
00:54:21,895 --> 00:54:23,479
And at Toyokawa, too!

551
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:26,858
Each time you were in difficulties,
you begged me for help!

552
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:28,359
What?

553
00:54:28,485 --> 00:54:30,945
Where would you be without me?

554
00:54:31,697 --> 00:54:36,409
Each time I had to appeal
to the impresario on my knees!

555
00:54:36,535 --> 00:54:38,828
- Just remember all that!
- What?

556
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:41,956
You impudent, ungrateful brute!

557
00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:44,500
What? What did you say?

558
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,796
Who do you think you are?
Remember what you used to be!

559
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:51,007
You were a common
bathhouse whore!

560
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:54,427
You fell for me
and came begging to me.

561
00:54:54,553 --> 00:54:57,930
Who trained you
as an actress? Who?

562
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:04,703
Ungrateful wretch.

563
00:55:05,622 --> 00:55:07,623
You're lower than an animal.

564
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:09,500
You stupid bitch!

565
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:14,421
I can get along by myself
without any help from you!

566
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:17,508
I can get along just fine!

567
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:20,260
You make me laugh, you fool!

568
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:24,306
Who's the fool? It's you!
You're the fool here!

569
00:55:24,432 --> 00:55:26,225
How dare you say that!

570
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:28,268
I'll say what I want!

571
00:55:28,853 --> 00:55:31,939
Right, then,
I'm through with you.

572
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,275
I forbid you to come into this house!

573
00:55:38,613 --> 00:55:42,032
My son's different from your type.

574
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:44,993
He belongs to a higher race!

575
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,996
Don't forget that, you fool!

576
00:55:49,457 --> 00:55:52,292
What are you talking about,
you silly bitch!

577
00:55:57,173 --> 00:55:58,841
Idiot.

578
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:00,134
Stupid bitch!

579
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,317
Respectful silence, please!

580
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:14,490
Stop making such a racket,
warriors

581
00:56:14,616 --> 00:56:16,617
Listen with compassion
to a parent's plea

582
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:19,829
To save my daughter's life

583
00:56:19,955 --> 00:56:22,498
With consummate skill,
plot a clever scheme

584
00:56:22,624 --> 00:56:25,877
To hide on the path
by the tile-topped wall

585
00:56:26,003 --> 00:56:31,549
Then the shaven-headed Munetoshi,
owner of the Sukiya...

586
00:56:36,472 --> 00:56:38,723
There's hardly any punters in.

587
00:56:40,392 --> 00:56:42,852
Not much we can do about it.

588
00:56:42,978 --> 00:56:44,896
We'll be stranded.

589
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:47,148
May the Lord Buddha help us!

590
00:57:01,905 --> 00:57:05,449
Listen, Kayo,
I want you to do me a favour.

591
00:57:06,743 --> 00:57:07,868
Like what?

592
00:57:07,994 --> 00:57:12,415
There's a young local man
working at the post office.

593
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,377
A good-looking lad,
named Kiyoshi.

594
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:19,213
Oh, yes?
What about him?

595
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:20,798
Well...

596
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:29,306
- What's this for?
- Just take it.

597
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:36,313
- What's it for?
- Go and see this boy.

598
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,733
- I want you to seduce him.
- Seduce him?

599
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:44,238
He'll fall for you, I'm sure.
Do it for me.

600
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:47,324
I couldn't possibly do it.

601
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:49,003
I'm being serious, Kayo.

602
00:57:49,129 --> 00:57:51,464
But I've never even met him.

603
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:53,859
Very well.

604
00:57:54,694 --> 00:57:57,571
All right, if you won't even
do that for me...

605
00:57:58,097 --> 00:58:00,598
- Yes, but...
- Just forget it.

606
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:10,949
I'm not sure
I'd even be able to do it.

607
00:58:11,076 --> 00:58:14,495
You can.
That's why I asked you.

608
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:20,501
I have yet to find a man
who can resist your smile.

609
00:58:21,586 --> 00:58:24,713
You really think I can do it?
I might fail.

610
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:26,507
You'll be fine.

611
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,469
But why are you doing this?

612
00:58:30,595 --> 00:58:32,596
Just do it for me.

613
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:35,015
Let's see how good you are.

614
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:37,142
And keep the money.

615
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:43,190
Thanks a lot.

616
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:45,150
Tomorrow it is, then.

617
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:50,948
I'll give it a try, then.

618
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,962
POST OFFICE

619
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:32,865
A blank telegram, please.

620
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:43,208
- Can you lend me a pencil?
- There's a pen here.

621
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:46,336
I can't write with a pen.
Lend me a pencil.

622
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:56,054
I saw you on stage.

623
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:57,514
Oh, yes?

624
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,767
Your name's Kiyoshi, isn't it?

625
01:00:01,686 --> 01:00:03,937
How do you know that?

626
01:00:04,063 --> 01:00:06,565
A little bird told me.

627
01:00:08,026 --> 01:00:09,610
Despatch this for me.

628
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:13,906
"Come outside to seek me"

629
01:00:14,032 --> 01:00:16,575
No, it's: "Come outside to see me."

630
01:00:17,577 --> 01:00:20,537
- Who's it to?
- You.

631
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:34,218
Cover for me a moment.

632
01:00:53,738 --> 01:00:56,573
Come by the theatre
after the show tonight.

633
01:00:57,575 --> 01:00:59,534
I'll be expecting you.

634
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:12,550
Ma, I'm just going out.

635
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:18,055
- What are you up to?
- I left something at the post office.

636
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:35,239
Oi, give me a bowl of noodles.

637
01:03:55,695 --> 01:03:57,530
I'm glad you came.

638
01:03:58,448 --> 01:04:00,282
I didn't think you would.

639
01:04:04,335 --> 01:04:06,461
Are you shaking?

640
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:12,968
Me, too.

641
01:04:13,094 --> 01:04:14,511
See?

642
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:26,459
The sky's as blue as a tragedy.

643
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,837
What are you on about?

644
01:05:29,963 --> 01:05:32,298
I fancy eating a big pork cutlet.

645
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,976
I'm starving.

646
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:49,690
Oh, for a prawn tempura
and a bottle of cold beer.

647
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,862
With an electric fan blowing.

648
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:57,657
I bet people are tucking into it
as we speak.

649
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:03,788
Remember that girl in Handa?
She sent me a postcard.

650
01:06:03,914 --> 01:06:06,332
- A picture postcard.
- I got one, too.

651
01:06:08,418 --> 01:06:10,836
The one with a mole here?

652
01:06:10,962 --> 01:06:12,588
I got one myself.

653
01:06:12,714 --> 01:06:16,384
What?
What are we, three brothers?

654
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,344
What an idiot.

655
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:23,849
Hey, I saw that barber's daughter.

656
01:06:24,601 --> 01:06:26,852
Don't say anything.
It's hopeless.

657
01:06:27,854 --> 01:06:29,355
Forget her.

658
01:06:30,482 --> 01:06:32,983
Anyway, why's the Master
so easy-going lately?

659
01:06:34,695 --> 01:06:37,863
Where does he go every day?

660
01:06:37,989 --> 01:06:40,366
I see him stepping out every day.

661
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:44,578
No idea.
No wonder Madame Sumiko's worried.

662
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:46,872
What became of that manager Kimura?

663
01:06:46,998 --> 01:06:50,626
- Heard nothing from him yet.
- Not likely to, either.

664
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:53,045
Doesn't sound good.

665
01:06:54,965 --> 01:06:57,091
I reckon he's run off...

666
01:06:58,009 --> 01:07:01,178
...or else he'd be back by now.

667
01:07:04,378 --> 01:07:07,047
What'll happen
if he doesn't come back?

668
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:09,299
We'll be stranded again.

669
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:19,517
Look at that up there.

670
01:07:19,643 --> 01:07:22,937
Fly over here and drop us
some cold bottles of beer!

671
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:17,502
Is it all right, seeing each other
every day like this?

672
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:24,449
What about your work?

673
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:29,120
It's fine, someone's covering for me.
What about you?

674
01:08:30,998 --> 01:08:32,748
The show's finished.

675
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,710
How come no one came to see it?

676
01:08:42,468 --> 01:08:45,136
We'll have to say goodbye
to each other soon.

677
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:53,144
Listen, what will we be doing
this time next year?

678
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,314
Stop talking like that.

679
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:00,985
I bet you'll have found a pretty wife.

680
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,572
- I will not!
- Why not?

681
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:07,825
What about you?
What do you think?

682
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:11,662
Please. Don't.

683
01:09:12,706 --> 01:09:14,248
Why not?

684
01:09:15,959 --> 01:09:18,961
- Nobody's looking at us.
- You mustn't.

685
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:20,630
But why not?

686
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:24,008
I'm not such a good girl.

687
01:09:26,178 --> 01:09:28,429
I'm not good enough for you.

688
01:09:28,555 --> 01:09:30,348
Don't be silly.

689
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,184
At first...

690
01:09:34,228 --> 01:09:36,938
...I was going to seduce you.

691
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:39,273
I knew nothing about you.

692
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:42,944
But Madame Sumiko asked me
to meet you.

693
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:47,240
I was trying to make you
fall for me.

694
01:09:47,366 --> 01:09:50,243
It doesn't matter how it began.

695
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:52,161
It doesn't matter at all.

696
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:54,580
It doesn't matter.

697
01:09:56,375 --> 01:10:00,795
You mustn't.

698
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,881
We can't be together.

699
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:08,279
I wonder what became
of the manager.

700
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:11,032
It's troubling.

701
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,705
We mustn't take advantage
of the impresario's kindness.

702
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:23,127
- It's very difficult.
- It is indeed.

703
01:11:26,131 --> 01:11:30,343
When it's good, it's good,
but when we get stranded...

704
01:11:31,094 --> 01:11:33,429
That's our profession for you!

705
01:11:34,848 --> 01:11:37,099
Kiyoshi's not back yet?

706
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:49,987
Why's he coming home so late?

707
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:54,617
He must be studying
with the postmaster.

708
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,036
He's been late the last few nights.

709
01:11:57,829 --> 01:11:59,872
That's as maybe.

710
01:11:59,998 --> 01:12:05,127
But I have to go away soon,
so I want to see him while I can.

711
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,506
Just my luck...

712
01:12:14,106 --> 01:12:16,232
You'll be on your own again soon.

713
01:12:16,358 --> 01:12:18,234
Is the next show in Shingu?

714
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:22,363
It's supposed to be,
but I'm not so sure now.

715
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:25,408
I've always wanted
to visit Shingu.

716
01:12:27,536 --> 01:12:31,789
But you've got no relatives
living there now, have you?

717
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:38,963
Even the Tsukinoya Inn is being run
by someone else since the war.

718
01:12:40,966 --> 01:12:43,384
Life is an unknown course.

719
01:12:44,803 --> 01:12:47,263
The only constant is change.

720
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:56,105
Tell me, who is that woman?

721
01:12:56,231 --> 01:12:57,523
Who?

722
01:12:57,649 --> 01:12:59,692
That woman who came here.

723
01:12:59,818 --> 01:13:02,528
Oh, her?
She's no good, that one.

724
01:13:02,654 --> 01:13:04,322
Will you forgive me?

725
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:09,410
My mistake.

726
01:13:09,536 --> 01:13:12,663
I should've known much better,
but by chance...

727
01:13:13,499 --> 01:13:16,250
- Dearest...
- What?

728
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:20,505
Do you think I'm jealous?
At my age, I know better than that.

729
01:13:20,631 --> 01:13:23,049
I'm used to your crafty ways.

730
01:13:23,175 --> 01:13:25,134
Ouch! Is that so?

731
01:13:26,553 --> 01:13:28,054
Forgive me.

732
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:34,644
But the thing is, don't you think
she might talk to Kiyoshi?

733
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:38,272
- About what?
- That you're his father.

734
01:13:38,398 --> 01:13:42,902
I think it'll be all right.
She won't be coming here again.

735
01:13:43,028 --> 01:13:44,820
But she might see him.

736
01:13:44,947 --> 01:13:49,867
That would be awkward, yes.
But I don't think she will.

737
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:58,668
So...

738
01:13:58,794 --> 01:14:03,589
...that means you want
to remain as his uncle?

739
01:14:03,715 --> 01:14:05,424
That's right.

740
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:09,303
He mustn't know,
otherwise it would upset him.

741
01:14:09,429 --> 01:14:11,055
Yes, but...

742
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:15,226
Leave it as it is.
I'll just stay as his uncle for life.

743
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,373
Oi, wait there!

744
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:08,955
Where have you been till now?

745
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:13,543
Come here!

746
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,720
Come this way.

747
01:16:43,574 --> 01:16:46,910
Who was it you were just with?

748
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:50,455
Who was it? Tell me!

749
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,252
When did you first meet him?

750
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:58,422
Speak up!

751
01:16:58,965 --> 01:17:00,340
Tell me!

752
01:17:05,523 --> 01:17:08,609
Never mind who I was seeing.

753
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,945
- Leave me alone.
- What?

754
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:14,365
What are you trying to do to him?

755
01:17:14,491 --> 01:17:16,742
Are you trying to swindle him?

756
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:20,329
Is that what you think, Master?

757
01:17:20,455 --> 01:17:22,915
Don't play the innocent with me!

758
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:26,460
I know exactly
what your type are like!

759
01:17:26,586 --> 01:17:28,587
What's your excuse, then?

760
01:17:29,589 --> 01:17:32,549
Speak up, if you have one!

761
01:17:39,474 --> 01:17:43,644
It's only natural for you
to think of me that way.

762
01:17:44,771 --> 01:17:45,896
What?

763
01:17:46,982 --> 01:17:51,860
Even Madame Sumiko at first tried
to persuade me with money.

764
01:17:51,987 --> 01:17:56,323
What did you say?
She tried to persuade you to do what?

765
01:17:58,493 --> 01:18:01,453
Tell me what she told you to do!

766
01:18:01,179 --> 01:18:03,347
It doesn't matter now.

767
01:18:04,099 --> 01:18:05,641
Speak up or else!

768
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:08,144
That hurts! You're hurting me!

769
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:09,770
Tell me!

770
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:15,651
She asked me to seduce
that young man.

771
01:18:15,777 --> 01:18:19,488
What? Sumiko asked you
to do that?

772
01:18:19,615 --> 01:18:22,825
Really? That's what she asked you?

773
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:25,077
Is that true?

774
01:18:25,203 --> 01:18:26,537
Right!

775
01:18:27,456 --> 01:18:29,832
Bring her here this instant!

776
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,296
Hurry!

777
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:37,840
Bring her here now!

778
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:45,306
Right away!

779
01:19:39,177 --> 01:19:41,053
You wanted me?

780
01:19:41,179 --> 01:19:42,763
Come over here.

781
01:19:48,937 --> 01:19:50,395
What is it?

782
01:19:51,856 --> 01:19:54,274
What was that for?

783
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:57,820
You want to ruin my son,
you bitch?

784
01:19:57,946 --> 01:20:01,615
I told you to lay off him, didn't I?

785
01:20:03,576 --> 01:20:05,786
Why should I care about your son?

786
01:20:06,996 --> 01:20:11,125
A fine boy, he is,
having an actress for a mistress!

787
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:14,294
You bitch,
how dare you say that!

788
01:20:16,214 --> 01:20:18,298
Like father, like son.

789
01:20:37,777 --> 01:20:39,486
Angry now?

790
01:20:39,612 --> 01:20:42,030
Well, it serves you right!

791
01:20:45,285 --> 01:20:50,122
And so the world turns.
You can't always be lucky.

792
01:20:50,248 --> 01:20:52,499
I want you to remember that!

793
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:55,544
What?
You should remember it yourself!

794
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:58,672
You slut! You fool!

795
01:20:59,799 --> 01:21:01,925
I never want to see you again!

796
01:21:02,051 --> 01:21:04,678
Get away from me, you slut!

797
01:21:10,018 --> 01:21:12,895
- Wait a moment.
- What? Let go of me!

798
01:21:17,942 --> 01:21:20,402
Do you hate me as much as that?

799
01:21:20,528 --> 01:21:22,154
What?

800
01:21:23,531 --> 01:21:26,533
Don't you see why I had to do it?

801
01:21:27,535 --> 01:21:30,245
You kept the truth
about that woman from me.

802
01:21:30,371 --> 01:21:32,831
Understand how I feel.

803
01:21:32,957 --> 01:21:35,042
Well, now we're even.

804
01:21:37,045 --> 01:21:40,714
Let's just let bygones be bygones,
shall we?

805
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,424
Let's be friends again.

806
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:47,095
The theatre troupe's stranded,
so let's not quarrel now.

807
01:21:47,222 --> 01:21:49,514
Shut up and save your breath!

808
01:21:49,641 --> 01:21:53,060
After all you've done,
you can stop crying to me!

809
01:21:53,186 --> 01:21:55,062
Dearest! Master!

810
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,334
You fool!

811
01:22:30,839 --> 01:22:32,340
Slut!

812
01:23:16,427 --> 01:23:19,887
You're all so quiet tonight.
What's up with you?

813
01:23:22,099 --> 01:23:24,100
It's all gone belly up.

814
01:23:25,477 --> 01:23:27,729
Come on,
pull yourselves together!

815
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,941
Get me another drink.

816
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:35,361
- Have you got any money?
- No problem. Eh, honey?

817
01:23:35,487 --> 01:23:38,281
- I'll have one too, then.
- Me as well.

818
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:42,034
- You got any?
- Any what?

819
01:23:42,161 --> 01:23:43,494
Any money.

820
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:47,457
You know I don't.
Don't try to embarrass me.

821
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:49,834
Right, honey?

822
01:23:55,841 --> 01:23:59,719
Hey, get your hands off me,
you horrible man!

823
01:24:00,596 --> 01:24:02,263
What's with you?

824
01:24:05,058 --> 01:24:07,185
I wasn't doing anything.

825
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:10,605
You're talking rubbish.

826
01:24:11,607 --> 01:24:15,067
You're awful!
Let's get out of here, Yae.

827
01:24:16,278 --> 01:24:18,946
Hey, where are our drinks?

828
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:21,282
No money, no drinks!

829
01:24:27,456 --> 01:24:32,668
Listen, how long does the Master
intend on staying here like this?

830
01:24:32,795 --> 01:24:36,714
Our manager's not likely to return.

831
01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:42,011
That's why I've been thinking.

832
01:24:43,013 --> 01:24:44,347
What about?

833
01:24:46,475 --> 01:24:47,809
Forget it.

834
01:24:47,935 --> 01:24:50,978
What is it? Go on, tell me.

835
01:24:55,609 --> 01:24:58,236
Have you ever done
that sort of thing before?

836
01:24:58,362 --> 01:25:01,197
Only once.
With Omi & Company.

837
01:25:01,323 --> 01:25:03,449
Really? Me too.

838
01:25:04,326 --> 01:25:07,537
- How about you?
- What?

839
01:25:07,663 --> 01:25:09,664
Not so loud.

840
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:13,376
Let's do a runner
before it's too late.

841
01:25:13,502 --> 01:25:17,088
We can use the money in
the Master's purse. How about it?

842
01:25:18,173 --> 01:25:19,841
No way.

843
01:25:19,967 --> 01:25:23,511
Listen,
you can't take loyalty that far.

844
01:25:24,137 --> 01:25:26,013
I disagree with you!

845
01:25:26,139 --> 01:25:29,225
It's not for me,
but I won't stop you two.

846
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:34,522
- Not so loud, please.
- I have a penetrating voice!

847
01:25:34,648 --> 01:25:36,649
I won't tell on you, though.

848
01:25:39,027 --> 01:25:41,737
Shall we ditch the idea?

849
01:25:43,615 --> 01:25:45,157
Maybe we should.

850
01:25:45,284 --> 01:25:46,951
It's obvious.

851
01:25:48,078 --> 01:25:52,164
Why trifle with the Master?
After owing him so much!

852
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:58,588
A man who's ungrateful
is not a human being at all.

853
01:25:59,423 --> 01:26:01,799
You guys make me sick!

854
01:26:02,676 --> 01:26:07,597
I never took you two
for such delinquents.

855
01:26:08,724 --> 01:26:13,144
After all these years we've been
together, what are you thinking?

856
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:19,066
It was wrong of us, I see that now.
You're right. Isn't he, Sen-chan?

857
01:26:20,527 --> 01:26:22,111
I guess so.

858
01:26:23,071 --> 01:26:25,156
Of course I'm right!

859
01:26:25,282 --> 01:26:28,618
Listen, Kichi, I'm sorry.

860
01:26:28,744 --> 01:26:30,411
Anyway, lighten up.

861
01:26:30,537 --> 01:26:35,124
As long as you hear what I'm saying
and give up your stupid idea.

862
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,210
I understand it was a bad idea.

863
01:26:38,337 --> 01:26:40,421
Let's have a drink, yes?

864
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:43,633
Give us three drinks, will you?

865
01:26:45,427 --> 01:26:47,595
Do you have enough?

866
01:26:47,721 --> 01:26:49,263
Leave it to me.

867
01:26:53,018 --> 01:26:57,146
I put some cash aside
for hard times like these.

868
01:26:57,272 --> 01:27:01,734
Strange place to keep it.
It's stuffed with money, though.

869
01:27:02,611 --> 01:27:05,154
There's a lucky charm against
pickpockets in there, too.

870
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,031
Hey, three drinks!

871
01:27:07,783 --> 01:27:09,784
Oh, it's her.

872
01:27:11,453 --> 01:27:12,954
Welcome.

873
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:18,542
Give me a hot sake.

874
01:27:20,963 --> 01:27:22,922
Make it a flask.

875
01:27:24,257 --> 01:27:27,802
It's our lucky night.
We won't be needing this.

876
01:27:27,928 --> 01:27:29,637
Evening, madam.

877
01:27:32,099 --> 01:27:33,933
So this is where you've been.

878
01:27:36,144 --> 01:27:38,813
No news from the manager yet, then?

879
01:27:41,608 --> 01:27:43,275
Not a word.

880
01:27:43,402 --> 01:27:46,988
Chances are, madam,
he won't be coming back.

881
01:27:48,365 --> 01:27:51,409
He's a scoundrel, that one.

882
01:27:53,161 --> 01:27:56,414
Hey, where are our three drinks?

883
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,791
Be right with you.

884
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,924
How's this look?

885
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:56,096
More like that, no?

886
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,936
This is how the figures look.

887
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,151
Is that all?

888
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:13,405
That's the best we can do.

889
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:16,450
That's the very best,
mind you, Master.

890
01:29:17,327 --> 01:29:18,785
I see.

891
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:21,747
Only that much, eh?

892
01:29:22,832 --> 01:29:24,333
Very well.

893
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:28,545
Enough for train fares for everyone,
I suppose.

894
01:29:28,671 --> 01:29:30,255
That's it.

895
01:29:31,174 --> 01:29:32,841
All right, then.

896
01:29:34,177 --> 01:29:36,178
Let's go over it again.

897
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,773
Was it only your camera
that was robbed?

898
01:29:48,775 --> 01:29:52,986
- A cigarette lighter as well.
- And Kichi owes me lots of money.

899
01:29:53,112 --> 01:29:56,698
It's worse for the Master, though.
He had his purse stolen.

900
01:29:56,824 --> 01:30:00,661
What a bastard.
I'll kill him if I see him.

901
01:30:01,371 --> 01:30:06,875
I had my suspicions about him.
He was never straight.

902
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,210
That's right.

903
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:12,381
He even stole my charm against
pickpockets while I was sleeping!

904
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:15,467
He stole all I had, that bastard!

905
01:30:21,432 --> 01:30:22,974
Tell me, Sensho...

906
01:30:24,769 --> 01:30:26,853
What do you plan to do now?

907
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,023
What a mess we're in.

908
01:31:24,888 --> 01:31:27,681
Yatazo, your cup's empty.

909
01:31:27,807 --> 01:31:29,183
Thank you.

910
01:31:34,647 --> 01:31:36,023
How about you?

911
01:31:38,902 --> 01:31:44,239
I must ask your forgiveness
for this situation we're in.

912
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:47,993
I'm sure things will pick up
sooner or later.

913
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,414
I'll let you all know
when I'll be making a new start,

914
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:56,085
and if you're free,
then I'd like you to join me.

915
01:31:58,421 --> 01:32:01,799
Kame-san,
where are you planning to work?

916
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:07,346
Well, my brother-in-law is running
a pickle shop at Hamamatsu.

917
01:32:07,472 --> 01:32:09,223
Is that so?

918
01:32:09,349 --> 01:32:10,891
And what about you?

919
01:32:11,476 --> 01:32:14,937
I'm thinking of visiting
my former boss

920
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:18,023
and see if he'll take me on again.

921
01:32:18,149 --> 01:32:19,733
I see.

922
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:22,194
He's the owner
of the Matsu-no-yu bathhouse?

923
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,238
Yes, that's right.

924
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:30,744
Those who can find other forms
of employment ought to do so.

925
01:32:31,996 --> 01:32:35,207
Sugiyama, you say
you're going back to school?

926
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,084
Yes.

927
01:32:38,169 --> 01:32:39,920
And work part-time, too.

928
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:45,509
We're all going our separate ways,

929
01:32:45,635 --> 01:32:48,887
but I want you to remember me
from time to time.

930
01:32:50,056 --> 01:32:52,933
We've been through
hard times together,

931
01:32:53,059 --> 01:32:56,103
but we've certainly
had good times, as well.

932
01:32:57,939 --> 01:33:02,025
Master, as we're parting ways,
let's at least have a good send-off.

933
01:33:02,152 --> 01:33:04,361
Good idea. Yes, let's.

934
01:33:04,487 --> 01:33:07,781
Madame Sumiko,
why don't you come and join us?

935
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:13,495
It's a farewell party.

936
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:16,248
- Come on, madam.
- Please join in.

937
01:33:23,673 --> 01:33:25,757
Please, madam, sit down.

938
01:33:27,552 --> 01:33:30,179
- What happened to Kayo?
- I wonder...

939
01:33:30,305 --> 01:33:33,432
Come on, auntie, cheer up!

940
01:33:44,694 --> 01:33:49,948
Master, it's our last night,
so why not be nice to Madame Sumiko?

941
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:57,748
Well, Sensho, and you Roku...

942
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:03,545
We've been together
for a long, long time, haven't we?

943
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,345
Sensho,
the Master's talking to you.

944
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:16,850
We've been through thick and thin.

945
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:21,688
I'm afraid I was rather strict
with you sometimes.

946
01:34:22,899 --> 01:34:25,192
We've been together for many years.

947
01:34:26,277 --> 01:34:29,446
Forgive me, if I was...

948
01:34:53,263 --> 01:34:54,888
Grandpa?

949
01:35:00,228 --> 01:35:01,562
Grandpa!

950
01:35:02,689 --> 01:35:05,232
What's wrong, Grandpa?

951
01:36:30,693 --> 01:36:32,819
We're in a right mess.

952
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,155
What's happened?

953
01:36:36,824 --> 01:36:38,867
The troupe's disbanded.

954
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:41,495
My goodness. Is that so?

955
01:36:42,622 --> 01:36:47,751
The impresario has tried to help me out,
but it's all in vain.

956
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:53,465
He's been very kind to me.

957
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,719
Why don't you come in?

958
01:36:57,845 --> 01:36:59,846
Where's Kiyoshi?

959
01:37:01,808 --> 01:37:05,519
- Wasn't he with you?
- No...

960
01:37:05,645 --> 01:37:09,606
A young person came for him
with a message from you.

961
01:37:09,732 --> 01:37:12,567
- A young person?
- A girl.

962
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:17,364
- And he went out?
- Yes, with her.

963
01:37:38,803 --> 01:37:41,221
What's the matter?

964
01:37:42,098 --> 01:37:45,934
- This is terrible.
- What is it?

965
01:37:46,602 --> 01:37:50,647
Kiyoshi...
He's ruined, I'm afraid.

966
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:08,890
What's happened?
What has he done?

967
01:38:13,145 --> 01:38:15,229
This is awful.

968
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:19,025
What in the world has Kiyoshi done?
What's he done?

969
01:38:29,453 --> 01:38:32,163
THE TAMARUYA INN

970
01:39:01,193 --> 01:39:04,237
Hey...
Penny for your thoughts.

971
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:09,575
Any regrets?

972
01:39:10,577 --> 01:39:13,621
Of course not.
I brought you here.

973
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:16,541
- Even so...
- Even so what?

974
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:18,418
It was my fault.

975
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,297
- We shouldn't have come.
- Why's that?

976
01:39:24,174 --> 01:39:27,927
You've never had to deal
with a girl like me before.

977
01:39:28,053 --> 01:39:32,723
I'm not good enough for you.
The Master must be angry.

978
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:38,104
Why do you say that?
My uncle has nothing to do with it.

979
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:43,943
You told me you wanted to go
to college and study, didn't you?

980
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:48,322
It's a good idea.
You should do it.

981
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:52,410
If you don't,
you'll regret it afterwards.

982
01:39:52,536 --> 01:39:54,662
So you have regrets, then?

983
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:57,331
I don't need to go to college.

984
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:07,709
I want to tell my mother
about our plans.

985
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,086
She'll give us her blessing.

986
01:40:10,212 --> 01:40:14,048
- Even if she doesn't, I'll...
- No, it won't work.

987
01:40:15,467 --> 01:40:19,679
You should just go back home
to your mother.

988
01:40:19,805 --> 01:40:21,806
Please, go back home.

989
01:40:21,932 --> 01:40:25,476
Go home and do what?
What's the point?

990
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:30,565
This is farewell.
Here and now, for good.

991
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:33,234
And what will become of you?

992
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,778
The whole troupe's been disbanded.

993
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:39,908
You should just forget
about a girl like me.

994
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:43,077
I'll get by, somehow or other.

995
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,205
Don't be silly!

996
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:47,457
Please! Go home!

997
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:52,170
Go back home.

998
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:58,218
Please, go home. Please...

999
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:41,761
I wonder where he's gone.

1000
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:52,146
Like father, like son,
I suppose.

1001
01:41:53,649 --> 01:41:57,402
He's a fast worker.
I didn't know that.

1002
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:03,783
I had high hopes for him, like "a kite
can give birth to a hawk", as they say.

1003
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:10,123
I guess I was too optimistic
about his chances in this world.

1004
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:15,044
It's all been too much for me
this time.

1005
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:20,133
All my plans have gone to pieces.

1006
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:28,182
Listen, my dear,
you're worrying yourself too much.

1007
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:34,188
When he's taken all his savings
and eloped with a girl like that,

1008
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,983
how do you expect me
to think positively?

1009
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:40,153
Honestly,
I'm very disappointed in him.

1010
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:45,825
Even so...

1011
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:49,037
...I'm sure he'll come home.

1012
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:57,462
He's not a bad boy. He'll come home.

1013
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,089
You think so?

1014
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:03,051
You think he'll come home?

1015
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:07,555
I don't know what I'll do
if he doesn't.

1016
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:16,856
I know...

1017
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:24,280
I just don't understand
the youth of today.

1018
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:27,158
He'll come home.

1019
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:30,119
He's bound to come home.

1020
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:38,086
Listen, when he comes home,

1021
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:41,005
why don't you settle down here?

1022
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:44,592
And tell Kiyoshi the truth.

1023
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:48,221
He's old enough now to understand.

1024
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,266
He'll find out one day.

1025
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,731
He's bound to find out in the end.

1026
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:06,155
It wouldn't have come to this,
if we'd told him.

1027
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:09,242
Please, tell him the whole truth.

1028
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:16,416
Please tell him.

1029
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,754
And the three of us living together?

1030
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:25,049
I wish you would.

1031
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:30,304
- Shall we?
- Would you?

1032
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:32,765
Thank you so much.

1033
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:34,725
Kiyoshi will be delighted.

1034
01:44:39,314 --> 01:44:43,943
But... where can he be now?

1035
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,409
Shall I make you a drink?

1036
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:55,621
Warm sake, yes?

1037
01:45:05,407 --> 01:45:07,449
Oh, here he is!

1038
01:45:11,956 --> 01:45:14,207
Where have you been?

1039
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:21,896
Where've you been?

1040
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:27,444
- I have a favour to ask you, Mother.
- What is it?

1041
01:45:42,585 --> 01:45:43,918
You?

1042
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:47,964
How dare you show up here?

1043
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:49,507
You fool!

1044
01:45:50,426 --> 01:45:52,719
I'm sorry, Master.

1045
01:45:55,264 --> 01:45:58,600
I'm the one who's sorry! You slut!

1046
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:03,646
Stop it, Uncle!
Don't hit her, she's apologising.

1047
01:46:03,773 --> 01:46:08,318
What? How dare you
worry your mother like this!

1048
01:46:10,446 --> 01:46:12,113
Please don't, my dear.

1049
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:16,059
Shut up!
They deserve punishment!

1050
01:46:17,829 --> 01:46:19,497
- You slut!
- Stop it, Uncle.

1051
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:24,001
- What? How dare you...!
- Please stop it!

1052
01:46:27,255 --> 01:46:29,799
What do you think you're doing?

1053
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:40,893
- What the...?
- What?

1054
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:48,776
Do you know who he is?

1055
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:53,406
He's your father. Your real father.

1056
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,408
How dare you?

1057
01:46:59,429 --> 01:47:01,555
Just as I thought.

1058
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:04,892
That's what I thought all along.

1059
01:47:09,272 --> 01:47:12,942
Mother, you said my father worked
at the town hall in Shingu,

1060
01:47:13,068 --> 01:47:15,319
and that he'd died years ago.

1061
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,824
I believed it. I still believe it.

1062
01:47:20,951 --> 01:47:24,536
I don't need a father.
I don't want a father in my life.

1063
01:47:24,663 --> 01:47:26,413
I don't need one.

1064
01:47:31,628 --> 01:47:36,840
He didn't want you to know
you were the son of an itinerant actor.

1065
01:47:36,967 --> 01:47:40,469
He didn't want you to feel ashamed.

1066
01:47:41,304 --> 01:47:44,682
How come? How come?

1067
01:47:44,808 --> 01:47:49,228
He wanted you to study hard
and become somebody.

1068
01:47:51,147 --> 01:47:56,443
So your father worked hard and
sent me your school expenses.

1069
01:47:56,569 --> 01:47:58,070
That's enough.

1070
01:47:58,196 --> 01:48:00,781
- Stop it.
- But...

1071
01:48:00,907 --> 01:48:02,366
Listen, Uncle...

1072
01:48:04,327 --> 01:48:06,829
Why did you show up
all of a sudden?

1073
01:48:06,955 --> 01:48:10,499
And why are you only telling me
all this now, Mother?

1074
01:48:10,625 --> 01:48:12,626
You two are so selfish.

1075
01:48:13,336 --> 01:48:15,546
I don't need a father.

1076
01:48:15,672 --> 01:48:17,047
Get out!

1077
01:48:20,969 --> 01:48:22,302
Get lost!

1078
01:48:23,596 --> 01:48:25,180
Get out!

1079
01:48:43,491 --> 01:48:44,867
Forgive me.

1080
01:48:47,829 --> 01:48:49,830
I knew nothing about it.

1081
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,501
I'm afraid he's right.

1082
01:48:54,627 --> 01:48:56,587
He's quite right.

1083
01:48:57,547 --> 01:49:01,759
One can't suddenly show up
out of nowhere

1084
01:49:01,885 --> 01:49:04,344
and assert one's parental authority.

1085
01:49:05,722 --> 01:49:08,891
Why are you talking like that, dear?

1086
01:49:10,852 --> 01:49:14,229
I think I'll set out on my travels
after all.

1087
01:49:15,732 --> 01:49:19,526
It would be for the best,
better for all.

1088
01:49:21,154 --> 01:49:24,948
But Kiyoshi isn't angry with you
anymore.

1089
01:49:25,825 --> 01:49:30,579
Well, I'm going to start from scratch.

1090
01:49:36,998 --> 01:49:42,127
It's best I part company with him
as his uncle. As I've always been.

1091
01:49:47,007 --> 01:49:50,134
Next time I pass through here,

1092
01:49:50,261 --> 01:49:54,472
I'll be a great actor
and he can be proud of his father.

1093
01:49:54,598 --> 01:49:57,267
Let me look forward to that.

1094
01:50:00,271 --> 01:50:02,480
I will do that.

1095
01:50:03,023 --> 01:50:04,732
But, my dear...

1096
01:50:05,442 --> 01:50:09,070
Then we'll celebrate my success.

1097
01:50:12,157 --> 01:50:13,574
Master!

1098
01:50:16,412 --> 01:50:18,454
Take me with you.

1099
01:50:19,248 --> 01:50:22,292
I'll work hard for you.

1100
01:50:23,377 --> 01:50:28,840
I can't part with you like this,
I just can't!

1101
01:50:32,428 --> 01:50:36,639
Master, I'm begging you,
take me with you.

1102
01:50:38,434 --> 01:50:39,809
I beg you.

1103
01:50:41,103 --> 01:50:43,146
Did you hear that?

1104
01:50:44,356 --> 01:50:46,357
How pathetic of her.

1105
01:50:51,613 --> 01:50:54,866
Be good enough
to look after her as well.

1106
01:50:56,493 --> 01:50:58,870
I'm sorry I scolded you.

1107
01:50:59,997 --> 01:51:01,497
Forgive me.

1108
01:51:07,171 --> 01:51:09,547
Make a fine man
out of Kiyoshi for me.

1109
01:51:10,674 --> 01:51:12,216
I'm counting on you.

1110
01:51:14,303 --> 01:51:17,722
You understand? Oblige me.

1111
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:36,407
Kiyoshi!

1112
01:51:46,293 --> 01:51:49,587
Kiyoshi! It's the Master...

1113
01:51:51,256 --> 01:51:55,343
Hurry up, go to him! Hurry!

1114
01:51:55,969 --> 01:51:57,678
Quickly!

1115
01:52:13,103 --> 01:52:15,938
Where's Uncle? Where's he gone?

1116
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,735
What's happened to Uncle?

1117
01:52:22,946 --> 01:52:24,780
Your father?

1118
01:52:28,076 --> 01:52:30,786
Your father's left for the road.

1119
01:52:37,794 --> 01:52:39,461
Don't stop him.

1120
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,014
Leave him be.

1121
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:55,144
Every time your father
visited this town,

1122
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:57,521
ever since you were a baby,

1123
01:52:57,647 --> 01:53:01,358
he always left like that,
with a heavy heart.

1124
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:06,822
Leave things as they are.

1125
01:53:08,616 --> 01:53:12,494
But only if you can become
somebody in life.

1126
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:34,011
Where are you going, Master?

1127
01:55:45,523 --> 01:55:47,190
Give me a light.

1128
01:55:56,326 --> 01:55:59,619
Tell me,
where are you going?

1129
01:56:07,545 --> 01:56:10,672
I'm at a loss where to go now.

1130
01:56:12,759 --> 01:56:14,968
Are you heading somewhere, Master?

1131
01:56:24,437 --> 01:56:26,855
Tell me, where?

1132
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:28,899
Where are you going?

1133
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:34,529
To Kuwana.

1134
01:56:35,823 --> 01:56:37,699
Where in Kuwana?

1135
01:56:38,659 --> 01:56:44,206
I think Kaneyoshi, the impresario,
may have an opening for me.

1136
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,544
I see.
I wonder if I could go with you.

1137
01:56:57,303 --> 01:57:00,222
I happen to know
that impresario very well.

1138
01:57:01,391 --> 01:57:04,184
Is there no way
we could go together?

1139
01:57:05,895 --> 01:57:07,562
It's sink-or-swim for me.

1140
01:57:10,775 --> 01:57:12,734
Shall we give it one more try?

1141
01:57:13,778 --> 01:57:15,946
Let's try. Yes, let's!

1142
01:57:16,072 --> 01:57:17,781
Give it a go?

1143
01:57:17,907 --> 01:57:20,075
Yes, we'll work it out.

1144
01:57:21,369 --> 01:57:22,744
Let's go.

1145
01:57:27,333 --> 01:57:29,418
Two tickets to Kuwana.

1146
01:57:31,504 --> 01:57:34,423
Hey, don't forget your luggage
over there.

1147
01:58:06,706 --> 01:58:08,081
How is it?

1148
01:58:10,881 --> 01:58:12,081
Here
